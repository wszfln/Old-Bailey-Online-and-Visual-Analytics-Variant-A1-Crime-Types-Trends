On Sunday, the 28th of June, the prisoners came to our house, separately, and staid there an hour and a half, or two hours; I saw them come in and have dinner, and I believe they joined company, but I did not wait on them myself; I saw them again on each of the four following days, at the same place - they had refreshment together, and drank together, I believe. On the 1st of July Thomas requested me to give him four sovereigns for 4l.'s worth of silver, which I did - I went to the bed-room to get the sovereigns; I keep my money there; they sat in the club-room, close adjoining the bed-room, not and arm's length from the door. On Thursday, the 2nd, six or seven more persons came in and joined them, and while the prisoners were in the club-room the drays came with beer - it was between one and two o'clock, to the best of my knowledge; my husband and the barman had to go into the cellar to attend to the beer - I had to wait on the people myself, and my daughter was in the bar; I went into the bed-room twice that day, while they were in the clubroom; I went to take some money out to pay my servant's wages, which were appointed to be paid that day-the servant was down in the cellar with my husband; I found my box safe, and locked it, after taking out the money; I took the key, locked the room door, and carried the keys down stairs to the bar, where I keep them - in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes the prisoners came down stairs to the bar, which is on the ground floor, in a hurried state, and requested two small glasses of brandy, which they drank very quick, and went out without paying for it - I called them back, and told them they had not paid for it; they begged pardon, and said they had forgot it - Thomas came back, and paid me 6d.; I went up stairs immediately to fetch down the glasses and things from the club-room; there was not any body there then; I went into my bed-room in about a quarter of an hour -I took the key off the chimney-piece, and when I tried to unlock the door the key would not enter the lock; I came down to the bar to look for another key, supposing I might have the wrong one - I went up again with the same key, which I found was the proper one; I could not open the door with it - I knelt down, looked, and saw something was in the key-hole; I tried again: I took the handle of the door, and found it was open - it was not locked; a skeleton-key fell out of the key-hole on to the floor: I saw my strong chest was burst open, and all the money was gone, all the bills and papers, and our licence - the cash-box was burst open also, and a crow-bar laid on the floor with it; I had counted my money that morning, and I had 97l. in gold, 40l. in silver, a cheque for 6l., and a 5l. Bank note, and several receipts and bills. I believe the prisoners had come there that morning between twelve and one o'clock - that is the usual time they came, and they went away, to the best of my knowledge, between three and four; it was before four - they came down occasionally during that time, and stood smoking at the door, looking at the drays; I spoke to them at the door - Thomas admired the situation of the house. At the time I took the money out to pay the servant only the two prisoners were in the club-room, and nobody went up stairs after that before I missed the money - I am positive of that; there is no other room up stairs for company besides the club-room - they are all bed-rooms; I have not seen any of my money or papers since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it nearer to there or four o'clock when the prisoners went away? A. I believe it was between three and four o'clock, and think it was nearer four than three; I think I paid my servant about three o'clock - I think there had been seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100004"/>more persons in the club-room that day, but they were all gone; I had some knowledge of one of them, but the other six were strangers; when the prisoners left they came down stairs together - I am sure I saw them come down together - I cannot be mistaken; the other persons went away two or three at a time; we have not many customers - it is a new house: I was astonished at so many being there that day - I did not particularly notice what time the others left. While the beer was being brought in I was the only person who attended to the customers; my young man served them before - we have a tap-room opposite the bar; there might be five or six persons there during that day - I will not say there were not ten or twelve; I did not take an account of them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the tap-room below stairs or above? A. Below, even with the bar; I am positive that when I went up to get the money only the prisoners were in the room.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's danghter. I saw the prisoners at my father's house in June and July; I saw them there on the 2nd of July, between the hours of one and four - I think they went away between three and four o'clock; I saw them drink the brandy - nobody went up stairs after they went out before my mother went up - she came down stairs before she missed the money; I was in the bar - nobody went up stairs then, or I must have seen them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is there a water-closet on the same floor as the bed-room? A. No, not exactly on the bed-room floor; it is nine or ten stairs below that, on the landing - there are nine or ten more stairs down to the ground floor; it is rather a small water-closet; I am not certain, but I consider it was not four o'clock when they left - there might have been seven, or perhaps eight persons in the club-room, not more; I saw them every one go out - there might have been three or four persons in the tap-room; I do not suppose there were more, but am not positive there might not have been twelve; the last person came down from the club-room a little before four o'clock, I think, but am not positive it was the prisoners - they were the last persons, and they left together; the last person besides them had left about half an hour previous, quite as long as that, I think - my mother was up stairs when that person came down; she came down before the prisoners: we have been in the house three years, but it was only licensed last Michaelmas twelvemonth: there were three or four persons in the taproom at four o'clock - I cannot say whether any of them were there when the loss was discovered; that was after four o'clock - I dare say it was half an hour after.</p>

             walking along one of the booths, and as I came near him I thought he changed colour; he passed me, and changed countenance directly he saw me - I think he must have known me; I turned back, and asked how he did - he said very well: I asked if he knew me - he said very well; I asked if he had been at Mr. Budden's, at Paddington, Lisson-grove, yesterday; he said Yes - I then gave him into Buckeridge's custody, telling him he was one of the men, and to keep him while I went round the booth to look for the other prisoner - I went along the booth, and saw John smoking his pipe in the booth, with some tea things before him; I went and told the officer, who went down and took him - they both requested to be treated like men, and they would act so to us; in a few minutes Thomas called to a woman, whom he called his wife, and whispered to her for a length of time; I do not know what he said - she went off and spoke to some persons in the booth, not far from them; the men came forward - I cannot say how many there were; directly Thomas saw them come forward, he rushed through them, and said he would go and search for his umbrella - the men made way for him to go through; I followed him, calling Stop thief! they closed round me, and would not let me pass for a long time, till he had time to get a long way; I went after him at last, and got knocked down at different times by some persons unknown to me: I overtook and caught hold of him three or four times, but he got from me again - I followed him, calling Stop thief! a Bow-street patrol was passing, and took him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was that officer examined before the Magistrate? A. Yes; I do not know his name - I do not know the prisoner's brother William; I cannot say whether a person has occasionally been there, who is very like them; we are in the habit of seeing so many faces, but I have seen the prisoners so often I know them - I was not exceedingly busy that day; I had to attend the bar - I attended in the club-room between twelve and one o'clock; the man who took Thomas had a red waistcoat on - I saw him have hold of him; I suppose I was within ten or twelve yards of him - I got knocked down and beat about.</p>

            . I was servant to Mr. Budden, and left his service on the day of the robbery; I saw both the prisoners there that day - I saw them coming down stairs; to the best of my knowledge it was about three o'clock, but I cannot be positive of the time; as I came out of the bar-parlour door John was coming down stairs - Thomas was standing at the door, smoking a segar; I did not see them go away - I am certain of their persons: I had never seen them before.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Every time you went up and down you saw Thomas standing at the door? A. Yes - he might be there for about an hour; I first saw him there about two o'clock, and till about three I believe he was at the door: I saw John coming down stairs alone about three o'clock - I was at the bar door at the time, and I cannot be mistaken in Thomas having been at the door for an hour, smoking a segar; I had not been in the club-room that day - I had been in the bar: I cannot say how many persons had been in the tap-room that day - there were a few persons - I cannot tell how many; I had agreed to leave my mistress some time before: no examination was made of the persons on the premises at the time<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100005"/>the robbery was discovered that I know of; I left that night; the robbery was discovered about three o'clock, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

            . I live in Edgware-road. I was at Budden's house on the day of the robbery, in the bar, and saw the prisoners when they came down stairs; they were taking brandy and water - one of them was going away without paying; Mrs. Budden called them back - they paid then, and went away; I had never seen them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any charge made against them then, except about the brandy and water? A. No; they went away rather in a hurry. without paying, rather in a flurry; there was a little to pay for what they had had up stairs - they paid that, and were going away without paying for the brandy and water; I only saw them once; they were both together at the bar - it was in the afternoon: I went there about three o'clock: I did not go up stairs, nor notice whether any customers were in the tap-room - I did not look.</p>

            . I am pot-boy at this house. I know the prisoners by sight; I have seen them at master's house for five days running - I saw them both there on the day of the robbery (Thursday) at the club-room door, about half-past two o'clock, coming towards the stairs - they did not come down the stairs; I was going up to my bed-room - I staid up there about two minutes, and came by the club-room as I came down; I did not see them then; they were not there then - the club-room door was shut; they were not at the door - I am certain of their persons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How often had you seen them before? A. Never before those five days; I was examined before the Magistrate at the first and second examinations, before the prisoners' witnesses were called; witnesses were examined for the prisoners in my hearing - I know nothing about their attorney protesting against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Magistrate say, if the attorney did not call the witnesses he would? A. I heard something of that; I did not hear him say he could not go on with the examination for the prosecution till after the prisoner's witnesses were examined; I believe five witnesses were examined before me - I heard three witnesses called in and examined on the prisoners' behalf: I believe James Smith, Lewis, and another were examined - that was after me; they were examined a good deal and sworn.</p>

             out to me; I went and took him, told him he was charged with felony, and he must consider himself my prisoner - he asked what for: I told him for a robbery in Lisson-grove, and if he would step with me I would explain it more to him; he asked if I would allow him to go into the booth to pay his score; I said certainly I had no objection for him to go - he said he hoped I should not expose him; I said I should do nothing more than keep him safe; I went into the booth with him, and his brother John was sitting at a table there - he said to him, "I am going to town with this person;" Cockrane immediately said, "That is the other, take him as well;" I told him I should take him too - they paid their score, and then John got up; I got up, and moved to the same side as they were on - Thomas got up; I said, "Where are you going - I shall not permit you to go away from me;" he said he was going to his wife for his umbrella; we were immediately hustled, and he ran down to the bottom of the booth, pursued by Cockrane - I immediately closed on John, secured him, and handcuffed him immediately; I then proceeded down the booth towards Cockrane - John wanted to go out at the top of the booth; I said I should not permit that; I was still hustled by a parcel of persons - I told them I did not mean to leave him, and they might as well be quiet: at the bottom of the booth I saw Thomas taken by a Bow-street patrol; he closed in with him - the men turned round upon him, and prevented his striking him; Cockrane complained of having been ill-treated, but I did not see that done.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is the patrol who took Thomas here? A. No - he was at the office; the Magistrate did not deem his evidence necessary; I believe he was sworn and examined at the office, but cannot positively say - I have no doubt of it; if he was examined he was sworn; I believe I did administer the oath to him myself - I have no doubt of it, I think not; I know he was examined - three or four witnesses were examined for the prisoners; it was to prove an alibi for John.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not witnesses examined for the prosecution after those for the prisoners - for instance, King and Wakefield? A. Certainly, if they were examined at a subsequent examination; I think it was on the second examination.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many examinations were there before the Magistrate? A. I think three; the prisoners' witnesses, to the best of my belief, were examined some on the first or second examination; at the second or third examination I was desired to get more evidence, and Mrs. King came forward.</p>
               <p>Thomas Walker's Defence. You now behold before you an unfortunate individual, to be tried for an offence of which he is totally innocent; I acknowledge I was in the prosecutor's house on the afternoon in question, but solemnly declare I left the house five minutes after two o'clock. When I was apprehended Buckeridge and Cockrane came up to me, and directly I saw Cockrane I asked how he did - he answered very well, and asked if I remembered him; I said I could not be off remembering him, as he waited on me only the day before. Now I was in no place of secrecy when apprehended; Is it likely if I was concerned in so extensive a robbery I should have been in such a public place as a dancing booth? if I am found guilty of this offence, which I am innocent of, it will be the death of an aged parent and my wife, and bring me and my brother to an ignominous death.</p>
               <p>John Walker's Defence. I am innocent of this charge - I know nothing of it.</p>

Some time the latter end of the week after - I live about a quarter of a mile from the house; I do not know either of the prisoner - I never saw them before; I was never at Fairlop Fair; but remember several people in the room were talking of going to the fair the next day -I was in the club-room from one o'clock to four; I was not in the tap-room at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was exactly four o'clock? A. I had to meet another gentleman at four, and when I saw it was four I went away.</p>

             came into my shop - it was the first and last time he ever was there; mine is a shell-fish and sodaw-ater shop, in Grosvenor-place, Borough-road - he came in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100007"/>between three and four o'clock in the afternoon; another young person was with him - he did not pay for any thing himself; they had three bottles of ginger beer - another young man was in the shop talking with me; they got acquainted together, having recognized each other, and all three had a bottle of ginger beer; I know it was on the 2nd of July, because Friday was Fairlop Fair, and that morning I and three other constables went on duty to Whitechapel-road, being employed by the inspector of stamps, in consequence of the fair - we went down to regulate the vans and things, and on that morning this person went down towards Fairlop, and his brother William, not John, was with him; I saw them go by St. Mary's church, Whitechapel, about eleven o'clock in the morning, in a sociable, and two others in their company - I imagine that my shop is at least three miles from Lisson-grove.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did this man stay any time in your shop? A. I think he staid nearly half an hour; I suppose it was half-past three o'clock when he came - it was near four when he left, for he took a small silver watch out of his pocket, and said, "It is near four, I shall go to tea;" he was on foot.</p>
               <p>Q. Is his brother William at all like him? A. He is a deal stouter than him - he more resembles him in the face than this one; William is stouter than either of the prisoners, but is very like him in the face.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is William like in the face? A. He is more like Thomas than the other, but any one who knew them would know them to be brothers from their faces.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. You say that he was a stranger to you when he came into your shop? A. Not exactly - he passed my shop with another person, and I called him to me; I knew him before, but he had not been in my shop before - I knew him, and knew William; I think I have known William since February.</p>

Thomas Walker has worked for me for the last six months occasionally, making fronts - he did not bring home any thing on the 2nd of July; he brought me two fronts on the 25th of June - he is a good workman, and his character appeared very good; I dare say he could earn 2l. a week - the most I ever paid him was from 18s. to 20s. a week, and I know he worked for other people at the time.</p>

            . Q. Was John in the habit of going out with his coach at half-past eight o'clock? A. No, he is in the habit of driving a night-coach - he went out this morning on account of keeping some horses at home that day for the fair; he does not usually drive a day coach - he brought me home the 10s. a little after eight o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>MRS. BUDDEN re-examined. I cannot exactly say the time I went to get the money to pay the servant - it was during the time the prisoners were in the house; Thomas sat so close to the door he could have opened it with a key- this was between twenty minutes and half an hour before I missed the money; I am positive nobody was in the room but the prisoners when I went up for the money for the servant.</p>
               <p>Q. You put the key in the door, and it would not turn- did you try the handle at that time? A. No - I found it would not open, and knowing I had not unlocked it, I went down to see if I had the wrong key; the skeleton-key fell inside the room door - when I got the money for the servant the club-room door was open; the prisoners could see me lock the bed-room door - I am positive I locked it after me; there were thirty half-sovereigns among my money - I examined it all that day; I have no doubt of the prisoner John; it was not a stouter or shorter person - he is the man, I am certain; I have not the smallest doubt of it; I served him at the bar with brandy - I am satisfied I saw Thomas on the 2nd of July, and spoke to him at the bar before he went away - he said it was a beautiful situation, and he should have no objection to take a house himself in that situation.</p>

             re-examined. I am sure I saw Thomas on the 2nd of July - my reason for knowing the time and day so particularly is, on Saturday I went to Union-hall, which I generally do, and heard of their being apprehended at Fairlop Fair; I said, "If I had known Thomas was wanted, I could have taken him in my shop on the Thursday afternoon, between three and four o'clock"- I first became acquainted with him at Union-hall, in February, but I do not suppose I spoke twenty words to him from then till he came into my shop - I have met him four or five different times, and have met his brother several times since this occurrence.</p>
               <p>Q. What enabled you to speak to seeing him between three and four o'clock? A. I stopped at Union-hall till about three o'clock, when the prisoners leave there, then went straight home, and in about twenty minutes Walker passed; I said, "How do you do?" he came in, and a man named Seeley in my shop recognized him as having been to school with him; my shop is nearly opposite the Obelisk.</p>

            . I am headborough of Holloway. On the 24th of July, at four minutes to twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner come through the Holloway-gate toll-bar, on a horse, riding - there was some suspicion that the horse was not properly come by; I went and asked him where he was going with it, and whose horse it was - he said he was employed by a man at Finchley, and was going to the Sugar Loaf, Whitechapel; I asked what he was, and how he came in possession of the horse - he said he was a hay-maker out of work, and was employed by a man he never knew or saw before, and was to have half a crown to take the horse to the Sugar Loaf, Whitechapel, where the person would meet him; it was a very tempestuous night; I said, "I will go with you, you must dismount and lead the horse, and walk with me" - I knew there was no such a house in Whitechapel; to be certain of it I went to Whitechapel watch-house, and asked the keeper in the prisoner's presence - he said there was no such a house, but there was the Three Sugar Loaves in Mile-end New-town; I said, "Well, we will walk together there" - I went, there was nobody there to meet him; I had put him into the Mile-end New-town watch-house before I went there; I put the horse at livery with the headborough of Whitechapel, who keeps stables; I asked the prisoner how he could be so foolish as to come on a job of that kind without drawing some money to pay the turnpikes, he being out of employment; he gave me no answer - I left him in the watch-house; I saw Young about six o'clock on Saturday evening, nearly opposite the Horse and Groom, at Highgate, and on Monday morning I met him by appointment at the Ram Inn, Smithfield - I went with him to the stables at Mile-end, and shewed him the mare - he claimed it; the prisoner was searched at the office, and on him were found two half horse-cloths, a bridle with a very strong bit, snares to catch hares, a pair of plated spurs, and two whips to tie on a stick to flog a horse with, a razor cut into notches, which will cut any gate through, a girth strap, two keys, one of which will open a gate I suppose; it is not a picklock-key - I have not tried it to the prosecutor's gate; it is the key of his own box, I dare say.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Why do you say you suppose it will open a gate? A. I think it will open any thing, it will certainly open a padlock; I have not tried it - it looks like a key for a gate; the razor will cut a gate - I know these are snares; I did not take him to the Three Sugar Loaves, because the houses were all shut up - it was two o'clock in the morning when we got there; I went to see if any body was waiting for him - the watch-house is within three doors of the house, and if I had seen and body, I should have fetched him to know if they were the same; he walked with me very quietly, and never made the least resistance - he was on horseback when I saw him; I have some turnpike tickets which were found on him - he had come through the gate when I first saw him, and paid two pence; I was by his side when I first spoke to him - he never attempted to ride off, nor to run away - there was nothing to prevent his riding off, which was the reason I told him to get off and walk.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I saw the man in the road; he said if I would take the horse there he would give me half a crown.</p>

             re-examined. The prisoner knew my horses as well as I knew them myself, there is no doubt; he as been out of Mr. Southey's employ from four to six months; he was never employed on my premises - he lived about two hundred yards from me; he has seen my mare it work, and was backwards and forward about my stable and fields.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner an excellent character.</p>

On Saturday evening, the 1st of August my goods were moved, (as was customary) to my dwelling-house, for protection; and on Monday morning I missed two boxes of ribbons, and one of lace - information was given at Marlborough-street; it was put into the "Hue and Cry," and two days after an officer of Queen-square applied to me; a small portion of the ribbon worth 3l. or 4l. was shewn to me at the office, and some lace - I am certain it was my property; I had no private mark, but know the patterns both of the ribbon and lace - I undertake to swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. RYIAND. Q. You yourself know nothing of the removal of the goods on Saturday night? A. I do not; I can swear to all the ribbons - they were all the same pattern as I had lost - three or four patterns of ribbon, and three or four of lace; I swear positively to the eight patterns - the manufacturer supplies other persons; the patterns may be found in many other shops - I did not say at the office I could speak to but one piece, and that by its length: I said I knew all by the patterns - the Magistrate asked how much there might he in one piece; I said two or three yards - I never said I knew it by the length; I never saw it measured - it was held up in the hand, and turned out to be from two to three yards.</p>

Great Castle-street, between nine and ten o'clock; I left them in the passage at the bottom of the stairs - I pulled the door after me. and am certain it shut; I returned in ten minutes, and found the door still shut and latched, as I had left it, but the three boxes were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you packed the boxes yourself? A. No; I saw the lids put on, and saw the contents - I had seen them put in from the window; I went alone from the shop to the house - the servant let me in; she is not here - the door opens with a latch-key from the outside; I pulled it hard after me - I did not try it, but am sure it fastened; when I returned, I did not miss the goods, as the servant had been in the habit of taking them up stairs - she let me in the second time.</p>

After I had gone about one hundred yards towards Tower-hill I missed my pocket-book - there were about six persons assembled near the pavement as I came out of the public-house, but I did not go near enough for them to be able to touch my person; nobody had been near enough to touch me but the two women - we returned to the house, and mentioned my loss to the landlord - (I saw the women at Town-hall, Borough, on the following Tuesday, and was certain of them;) after mentioning my loss to the landlord, we went to Bull's Head-court, Borough.

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you sure that is all you can tell us? A. It is; the landlord's name is Coleman - I do not know his wife; I saw a female in the bar: I did not go to the house with the women - they were there about a minute before me; nor did I leave the house with them. I am married; neither I nor Williams applied for beds at Coleman's house, nor were we informed that the rooms were double bedded; I did not say a double bedded room would be better, as I would have more fun. I did not say to Coleman or his wife when I returned, that the two women were not the women who took the property; that is as true as all I have said - I went there to have a glass of gin and water, not having taken any thing since dinner; I had been to Mr. Van's, in the Borough, on business - Coleman's house is nearly opposite the Custom-house; it was in my road home, and perhaps my nearest way - we had two glasses of gin and water each; the women came up as we stopped at the bottom of an alley, by the public-house; nothing passed at the public-house about beds: neither of the women charged me with taking indecent liberties with them, nor did I - I heard one call the other Mrs. Burke.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to find your way to Bull's Head-court? A. In consequence of one of the women saying to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100011"/>the other, "I must go;" the other said, "Oh, it is not so far; Bull's Head-court is not so far," and Williams said he heard one of them say they lived there; I did not hear it myself - I am rather deaf: I suppose my pocket must have been exposed when I leant my head on my elbow - my pocket-book could be taken without my knowing it; I lost it between half-past seven and a quarter to nine o'clock - I was perfectly sober; the women were not in our company: there was an old man in the room - he went away; there was another man there, and these women - that was all besides us; Williams went out for a minute while I was in the house, not more: I swear neither of the women went with him - I had no intention of any familiarity with them; I gave neither of them any money.</p>

            . I am a ship-chandler, and live in Wapping Dock-street. On the 22nd of August I was with Suter; we went into the Bear and Wheatsheaf, as near as I can guess, from seven to half-past, by ourselves; before we went in I observed the prisoners at the corner of the alley - I saw the same two in the house when we went in; I had no conversation with them before we went in: we sat in the parlour, and they were there - one was sitting at the same table as us, and the other standing up; in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes they asked to drink with us - we had no conversation with them before that; they had no liquor that I saw - I sat on the opposite side of the table to Suter: on their asking to drink with us I said she might - I think it was O'Brien; she was sitting near to me, but not particularly close - she was standing up at first; the other was sitting on the left of Suter: she also asked to drink, and he allowed her - she was near enough to him to touch him, I think; he pulled his pocket-book out while Burke was sitting by him, and said loud enough for them to hear, that he had a 20l., a 10l., and two 5l. notes; the women were sitting with us for an hour or an hour and a quarter - I observed Suter put his pocket-book into his pocket, after counting his notes; nobody was near enough to him to take it but Burke; one of us said, "Let us go," and then the women went out - we each had two glasses of gin and water; we had drank nothing, and were both perfectly sober; we left four or five minutes after them, and went down Thames-street, towards Tower-hill, which is the direct road to Limehouse; we got about one hundred yards from the house when Suter complained of his pocket-book being gone. In the course of conversation I heard one of them, (I think O'Brien,) say she lived in Bull's Head-court; we returned to the public-house, but I did not see them till at Guildhall, on the Friday following; a 5l. and a 10l. note were produced - I was not at Union-hall; there was no familiarity whatever between either of us and the women, nor any conversation that could lead to such a course.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; I saw the women first in Thames-street, but had no conversation with them - they did not cross to talk to us, to the best of my knowledge; several people crossed the street - I did not see them crossing; I saw them standing - I had no conversation with them in Thames-street, nor had my friend, to my knowledge; I believe I was out of his sight, about twelve yards, for a certain purpose; I did not see him talking to them - I dined at home that day: Suter came to my house - he did not dine with me; we had three or four places to go to on business, but went to no other public-house; I had no money but silver - I missed none; the women did not go into the public-house with us - I wanted none of their company; there was only one table in the room; we went into the parlour, it being the most respectable; nothing passed between us and them for a quarter of an hour - Suter and I were talking on business; I had not the slightest reason to believe them women of the town; I believe one of them mentioned her husband.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she threaten to tell her husband of Mr. Suter's conduct? A. She did not say any thing of the kind; I went out of the room for about a minute and a half, for a necessary purpose, but not with O'Brien; Burke was on Suter's left side - they might very likely touch each other; she sat close to him - I consider she was sitting near enough to touch him - he was in conversation with me- he was not directing his conversation particularly to her- the landlord came in three or four times; nobody asked for a bed in my hearing, nor was any thing said about a double bedded room; we were both perfectly sober - he pulled his pocket-book out because he said the corner of it was torn; he found his money safe: there was one person in the parlour: I heard Coleman say his wife was not at home - I think he said so to the person at the bottom of the table; they appeared intimate - I did not ask for a bed - all the conversation I had with him was about the reckoning; Suter did not say he was sure the women had not taken the pocket-book; he suspected they had took it, and I believe said so.</p>

            . I live with Mr. Winstanley, a haberdasher. On Saturday, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the two female prisoners came to the shop; I recollect their persons perfectly well; O'Brien tendered me a 5l. note for goods - I declined giving change for it, and handed it over to Mr. Winstanley; he said he had no change; I asked if they had 6s. 9d. to pay for the goods: they said they had not, and went out, taking the note and leaving the goods; Mr. Winstanley sent a young man after them, to say be could give change, and they came back- Mr. Winstanley took the note into his room to look at it; he came out, and said he doubted its being good, but if they would leave it till Monday morning he would ascertain if it was good, and they should have the change, which they agreed to, and went away; on Monday morning O'Brien came with the prisoner Hackett - Mr. Winstanley was out; I said if they would call again they should have the money if the note was good; Hackett said it was a hard thing the woman should be detained, as she wanted to go in the country - they left; Hackett called again, alone: master told him he could not pay the money without the woman being present; he went to fetch her - Mr. Winstanley sent a young man to watch where he went to, and he was detained; the woman never came - Hackett was brought to our shop and taken in charge; I saw O'Brien at Guildhall on Friday, and was perfectly certain of her being the person; I put my initials on the 5l. note.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When? A. Previous to its being given up to them on the Saturday night.</p>

            . I am an officer of Town-hall. On Saturday, the 22nd of August, about ten o'clock at night, Mr. Williams and another gentleman came to me - I went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100012"/>McCarthy's house, but found nobody then; on Monday the 24th, about nine at night, I found O'Brien at the Bull, Bull-court, Tooley-street; I knew her before - I told her she was charged with robbing a gentleman, but she was half drunk; I took her into the kitchen of the publichouse - she had a large bundle; I took 19s. 7d. from her; she had changed a sovereign for a pot of beer in my presence; I went to McCarthy's, and found Burke partly concealed in a coal-hole; I took her out of the house - she had in her left hand a small basket with 11s. in it, and in her right hand a small paper rolled up; I endeavoured to secure that, but she snatched at it and fore it - I have the pieces here; it is a receipt for a 10l. note, No.3807, deposited with Basset, a watch-house-keeper, at Bermondsey, that evening; O'Brien said, in her presence, "That is the woman that robbed the gentleman;" Burke made no answer; at six o'clock on Tuesday morning, I went with Basset to Dockhead, and apprehended Mahoney, and a woman named McCray; I told Mahoney he was charged with claiming a 10l. note on Friday evening at the watch-house; he said he was drunk at the time or he should not have done it - (receipt read).</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. O'Brien said Burke had robbed the gentleman; did you not say she was very drunk? A. O'Brien was half drunk.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank - I have a 5l. note, No.25,368, dated 7th July, 1829, which was stopped at the Bank on the 24th of August - it was claimed by Suter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you receive it yourself? A. I got it from the Secretary's-office, from Mr. Stewart, who is not here - I only know it was stopped by a memorandum on it in Stewart's writing - who brought it to the Bank I do not know.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has it been paid by the Bank? A. It has not - if it had it would have been cancelled; if it had not been stopped it would have been paid - it is a genuine note.</p>

            . On Monday, the 24th of August, I was on duty for a patrol of Bermondsey - Burke and Mahoney were brought in, charging each other with a felony; Burke gave her name as Hackett and said Mahoney had robbed her of a 10l. note, and he said she had robbed him of one; they were both intoxicated; the note was in the possession of Burke - I never saw it in Mahoney's possession; I detained it, and gave Burke a receipt for it; she said her husband was foreman at the London-docks, and had earned it; the receipt produced is my writing - it has been torn since; I have had the note in my possession ever since -Suter claimed it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. About what time did you see Mahoney at the watch-house? A. About five minutes to nine; I did not ask his address, for I knew him from his infancy, and knew his parents to be respectable; I apprehended him at his lodgings next morning - I believe he is married.</p>

            . I am a clerk at Smith, Payne, and Co.'s. On the 21st of August I paid Suter a 25l. cheque, drawn by John Jones - I gave him a 20l. note, No.19,232, dated 10th July, 1829, and a 5l. note, No.35,368. dated the 7th July; I saw the 5l. note at Guildhall, and am certain it is the same. Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the entry in your writing? A. Yes; I have seen Suter five or six times before, and am certain I paid it to him, for he applied to me very soon after for the numbers of the notes - I paid it about half-past three o'clock - the book the entry is in closes at four.</p>

On the 22nd of August, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening the prisoner Mahoney came with two women - I recollect Burke as one of them, the other is not here - they appeared intoxicated and scarcely knew what they wanted; Mahoney told me to take down a shawl marked 7s., both the women spoke about it - another shawl was taken down, they bargained for both, and produced a 10l. Bank note - it came from Mahoney's hands; I did not give change for it - it was snatched out of my hand by Burke, and she put it into her bosom - they ran away - I did not follow them.</p>

I saw Suter and another gentleman at my house on the 22nd of August; I went into the parlour, twice while they were there - I was taking in beer - there were two females there, they sat on the same seat; I have no recollection of the prisoners; I cannot say whether they drank together - Suter came and asked me something; I believe a bed was named - I told him it was engaged - he said could he have a bed - I said it was engaged - we are rather particular who we take in - and when gentlemen and ladies come they have bagage - I said, "I had no single bedded room: and for man and wife, I had none at all." He said nothing about a double bedded-room - I saw the women leave before them; I thought the prosecutor had come from Gravesend, as the boat comes in at that time; he did not ask for a bed for more than himself - he merely asked if I had a bed; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100013"/>said, they were all engaged - I do not know why I said I had no single beds.</p>

under his coat - I saw it fall from him, and picked it up; I took him to the street-keeper, and delivered it to Martin at the Mansion-house; he said at the watch-house that he took it, and asked me to forgive him, saying it was his first offence.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any body present when he said that? A. No; the constable had gone out at the door - I saw it drop from his coat on the payement.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 21st of August I heard some tools had been taken from a house in Elizabeth-street; the prisoner had been given to me by a private watchman, on a charge of stealing some other tools; he said he did not steal them but his brother did, and sold them to Kitchen; I went to the prisoner's mother's, who said he had a younger brother, who has since been punished; the prisoner told me, that Kitchen told him his brother had stolen them; I went and found Kitchen at work; I said I wanted the plasterers' tools; he denied having any; I said I had witnesses to prove it - and then he went into a foundation and got them out; he said he had them from Tintar, which is the name the prisoner and his brother go by; I took him to the prisoner, who said, "My brother gave me the tools."</p>

Oxford-street, where we found the female prisoner: I said to her, "Henry is in custody - we have a search-warrant, and are in possession of a good many facts to prove that you have received some things; you may do as you please about what you say to me:" she said, "I shall not deny it;" she then opened the drawers, and gave me these things - she said she had lived in the same family, and expected to be married to Henry - that they had bought those drawers and some other things; she gave me this purse of money, which she said he gave her to save for him. Wilks said at the office that he gave these things to her, and she knew nothing about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She at once told you of it? A. She gave me the money; I believe I first said, "Whose money is this?" there was no hesitation about her - she behaved very well: I believe it was not her father and mother who lived in the house with her.</p>

Yes; I did not press him to prosecute her - there are about twelve women in the employ now; I cannot say how many there were at that time - no person is here who heard her say the calico was in her basket; Mr. Jay and one of the clerks were present at the time: Mr. Jay was rather reluctant to prosecute - I am not aware of telling him that he ought to do it; I cannot swear I did not: I cannot identify any of these articles by a particular mark - I compared this calico with the piece we had then in use, and it matched exactly - here is a trifling stain of fruit on it, which I saw when it was taken out of the basket.</p>

Yes, the footman and housemaid; I am not aware that the footman gave the prisoner the chain; I had discovered the footman wearing my shirts, and he is now in Clerkenwell prison for threatening the life of the prisoner, who gave evidence against him for that offence- it was the prisoner who told me of that footman; I solemnly believe the footman did not give her the chain; she did live with a lady named Abrahams, and had a good character; I did not see the basket found.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Davis. The prisoner showed me a chain, which I believe was this, when I had been there but a week; she said it was her own - she came into the kitchen one Sunday morning, and said her mistress was going to search her box, but she should not see all, as she would fill her basket out of it; I believe it was her own basket - it had stood by her bed side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did she show you the chain? A. I cannot tell the time of day - it was in her hand; she did not say it had been given to her by the footman - I had seen the basket several times, and had seen it the morning it was found - she told me it belonged to her; I know it was the same basket by a string on it - I believe this to be the same chain as she showed me, but there is no mark on it; she showed me two chains - one was larger.</p>

            . I am constable of Ealing. I was sent for - Mr. Davis showed me a basket on a table, and a variety of other articles; this gold chain was among them - Mr. Davis asked me if I did not remember a gold chain being mentioned at the time the young man was brought up - I said Yes; he said, "This was the chain that was mentioned." As I was taking the prisoner to the watch-house, she asked me if it was any more harm to steal gold than any thing else; I did not know what answer to make - I might give some trifling answer, but I cannot recollect what; she asked what I thought she would be done to - I said it was not in my power to tell her that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know that the prosecutor had charged the footman with stealing this chain? A. No - he said that he had found him wearing one of his shirts: and previous to that there had been a gold chain missing - the prisoner was the witness against him.</p>

            . This is my chain - it was kept in my daughter's dressing-room; it was lost three months ago, some time before I took up the footman; when it was produced I asked the prisoner how she could stand by and hear of its being lost - she said, "I found it at the door."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not charge her with stealing a knife? A. Yes; I asked my daughter to lend me a knife - she said Mary had one; she brought a knife to me which I had in use for twelve months -I called up the prisoner and from her answers I was satisfied she was the pilferer about the house; I think she had been there about four months, and the footman about six months - this basket was concealed in the scullery - the servants have access to it; I have had frequent opportunities of seeing the chain; it had been a watch-chain, and had three rings on it, but my daughter took them off - I believe it to be mine; my daughter is twenty years old.</p>

            ; we live in Duke-street. On the 6th of September the officer came to me - I have no doubt the solder and lead is ours; the prisoner was our apprentice for four years - I missed a great deal of solder, which is like this, cast in sand - solder is generally cast in moulds.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was very faint for want of victuals: a man I worked with asked me if I should be at home the night before; I said Yes; he came and brought this solder, and told me to lock it up in my box - he told me on the Sunday morning to help him carry it, and as I was going along I was stopped; he said if any one stopped me to say it was lead from my master's, and they would let me go.</p>

At work, but not all day, in Brown-street, Grosvenor-square; I was at work all the week at the same house I live in; I went to work at near four o'clock in the afternoon that day - I was not at work in the morning; I knew Leary by his mother's selling fruit at the next stand to my mother in Oxford-street; I was not acquainted with him - I used to go about walking with him - I am as positive of the waistcoat and trousers as the jacket; the waistcoat was a kind of drab colour; I was taken myself on suspicion of this, and locked up three days and nights; I was taken on the day of the robbery, about four o'clock, as I was going to work; I was carrying a hod of stuff into Oxford-buildings - I was never in trouble, nor ever in prison before; I was never charged with an offence, nor ever flogged.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in any public prison? A. I was flogged once over the other side.</p>

No; he came down stairs against me as I came up from my own room; my place was secure then - I secured the door; I had no suspicion, as I thought he was going to the privy, which is down there; I remained in my room till I went out that morning; whether he had been up to any of the lodgers I cannot tell - I know the witnesses by their living in the neighbourhood; I cannot say whether I saw them in the street the day before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe whether the corner shop was closed? A. The oyster shop at the corner was not closed; one shop at the corner is usually closed early - in the part of the street the chaise had passed, there is a coach-stand, and a few of the coaches were in advance, also a cabriolet was passing at the time, I am a certain - the horse appeared a fine looking animal; I made an angle and overtook him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did the shriek come from before or behind you? A. From the opposite side, in front of me rather - the horse was coming towards me; I stopped it as it came by me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say any damage he had done, he should be glad to repair as well as he could? A. I believe he did tell the officer so; the shriek appeared to me thirty or forty yards off - I thought it was a female; I heard it plainly - it might frighten some horses; it was a spirited animal.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you look over as soon as you heard the shriek? A. I did, and the man was in the act of falling.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far from where it happened was the horse stopped? A. About five yards from where the man fell - I merely judge of the rate it went; I am a waiter, and have no knowledge of speed.</p>

            . I am senior house surgeon of the Middlesex-hospital. On Thursday night, the 6th of August, between nine and ten o'clock, the deceased was brought to the hospital; he was breathing with great difficulty, and expectorating blood mixed with mucus - he had a trifling wound on the face, and was only partially sensible at times; I found several of the ribs on the left side of the chest fractured, and it was evident the lungs were wounded - I saw him daily till early on the morning of the 8th, when he died; I opened the body, and in my judgment his death was occasioned by the external injury he had received on the chest - several ribs were fractured on the left side of the thorax, and the lungs severely wounded; there was an escape of air into the integuments of the thorax, and an escape of blood into the lungs; a wheel passing over his chest might have caused the accident.</p>

            . I live in Marsham-street, Somer's-town; I have been a butcher, and I have belonged to a farm - I did not know the deceased. I was going towards Berwick-street on the evening in question, and observed a chaise cart coming along, with two men in it; the deceased was in the act of crossing, when the shaft struck him, and knocked him down; the wheel passed over him - the cart went on about fifteen yards, and was stopped; as soon as the man was run over, I observed that both men in the cart had hold of the reins, endeavouring to stop the horse - I should not suppose it went at the rate of more than eight or nine miles an hour before the accident; it afterwards went at the rate of nine or ten miles, I should think; the horse never stopped till it was stopped; I saw it stopped; one man got out, and went back to the crowd -I heard nobody call out - at the time he was stopped a cab came by, and asked him whose horse he was driving, and who had trusted him with a chaise; that perhaps might have made him more angry than he would have been - I did not know the prisoner before - I was there when he was taken; Valentine came up while he was in the chaise; he asked if he was a Police-officer; he said Yes - he said, "You are the man I want; if you will show me your authority I will get out, and go to the man;" he got out, and saw the man in Well-street, and told him he would make him any recompence in his power - the cart was taken to Blenheim-mews, behind Marlborough-street - the prisoner gave his address "Sago, Crawford-street;" Mr. Steel took the horse and cart home - it was coming towards St. Giles', from Regent-street; there was a brilliant light at the oyster shop at the corner of Berwick-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do I understand you to say you have belonged to a farm? A. Yes; I have been used to horses for twelve or fourteen years - this appeared a spirited young horse; the persons in the gig did all they could to stop it - I had observed it before it got to the corner of Berwick-street, before the accident; it was then in a trot - I had a very good view of him; I was in the dark and the horse in the light - I should not think it was above seven or eight yards from me when it happened - the deceased was not in the regular crossing.</p>

             were Davis' seconds; several others, called "beaters out," were in the ring, and several with watches in their hands - I do not know that any particular time-keeper was appointed; I did not hear "Time!" called during the fight - I was in the ring part of the time; they first went into the ring about two o'clock, and began to spar - the constable interrupted them, and they went to another field not far off: I should think a good mile - my brother rode to the second field; he was in very good health, and said he never felt better in his life - a ring was formed before he left the coach; the two fighters, and the same four seconds entered the field - I believe, in getting over the fence of the field. my brother sprained his ankle, but it got better and he did not go lame into the ring; he was a much slighter man, and not so heavy as Davis - the fight began; my brother was gaining the battle fast at the outset, but in one part of the fight he slipped and fell without a blow being struck: several parties called out "Foul!" and went into the ring to see how he had slipped; it was found a hole had caused it, and it was declared fair - they went on fighting; I went into the ring at that time to take some brandy in, and to prevent the fight if I could, but I was beat out - my brother was generally undermost at the close; they fell together, Davis generally uppermost - when my brother fell Flynn and Driscoll picked him up, and attended to him as seconds generally do; I should consider the fight continued half an hour, but my anxiety was very great - I was chiefly attending to my brother; I was inside the ring at several parts of the fight - I was frequently at too great a distance to hear what my brother might say.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You could tell what state he was in, whether he was able to go on? A. After he fell he gave two tremendous blows to Davis, and the battle was certainly very much in his favour - he was gaining ground till he gave in himself; the last round he fought, his seconds took him on their knees; he was brought up to the mark to fight again - he shook hands with Davis, and put an end to it himself.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean to say that at that time he exhibited no symptoms of weakness and exhaustion? A. He was weak the same as the other man - he stood to the scratch himself, and put out his hand; he did not speak a word from that moment till he died, for I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100028"/>never left him - he was quite insensible when carried off the ground, and remained so till his death, which was about five o'clock the evening following; neither of his seconds assisted in carrying him off the field.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had he been training for the fight? A. In the morning at breakfast he had 1 lb. of beef steaks, and told me he had done so for a fortnight each morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he considered the favourite? A. He certainly was; he gained the battle fast at first, and was a much better man than Davis - he was afraid to come near him: my brother was generally the first to strike the blows - many people went into the ring when"Foul!" was called, and were beat out; it was after he fell that the fight was so much in his favour.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came up to the scratch at the last round who bad the best of it then? A. It was evident my brother had the worst then, on account of the fall - it was proved the fall caused a concussion of the brain, and not any blows.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live on Red Lionhill. I was going home, and went to see this fight at Child's-hill, Hendon; it joins Hampstead parish - I got there about a quarter-past two o'clock, and was there when the ring was formed, and the whole of the time; I consider the fight lasted about an hour and a quarter, sixty or seventy rounds were fought - Davis decidedly had the advantage at the latter part of it, but at first I considered the deceased to be a much better boxer; Davis was the strongest - the other two prisoners acted as seconds - they fought about half an hour, and then Davis appeared getting the advantage; the deceased often came up after that, merely to be knocked down - that was generally the case; he appeared weak, and incapable of resistance, merely striking a blow and going down with it; he seemed to fall with the blow often, without being struck by his antagonist - it was considered that it was done to gain wind: I never heard him say any thing; I saw him come up the last time - he was brought up by his seconds to the scratch, and they retired; he stood up, and put himself. in a fighting attitude, then dropped his arms, and put out his hand - Davis shook hands with him, and Winkworth was carried away; a very stout man took him up in his arms to the outside of the ring; he had not fallen down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to walk out of the ring? A. The ring closed in directly they shook hands, and I could not see them; I saw him being carried out of the field; he appeared in a very languid state, and insensible - his head lolling over the arms of the man who carried him away; they took him towards a coach, but I did not follow; I have been at prize-fights before - I heard no observation about taking him away; in my judgment he fought a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes longer than he ought to have been allowed - I heard Driscoll during the fight, urging him on, saying, "Give him one for me;" the seconds on both sides excited their men, undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you not a constable? A. No, I have been one; I did not act as one on this occasion - I know nothing about Driscoll surrendering himself; I heard, "Foul!" cried on one occasion, when the deceased fell without a blow - I was present when a constable of Hampstead interfered; he said they must not fight in that parish, but go elsewhere - I heard somebody say, "Go to Child's-hill, and fight it out there;" I cannot say whether that was said by the constable or not.</p>

            . I am a green-grocer, and live at Hampstead. I was at the fight at Child's-hill: Davis appeared the strongest man - I was in the ring, close to the deceased: he was distressed from the beginning of the fight, and as long as I stopped, which was not till the end - I thought at first he was the best man, but the weakest; he was in distress, but the best at sparring - he fell every time; sometimes they fell together, and sometimes he fell alone - I thought it was from weakness in his knee; he was always undermost while I stopped: I heard him say,"So help me G-d, I am not able to fight any longer;" that was when they had fought about a quarter of an hour or more - he said that to Flynn and Driscoll, his seconds; they took him up again directly, as usual, and one of them(I think Driscoll) patted him on the back; I stopped about a quarter of an hour after that, and left the fight going on- the deceased seemed very weak all the time; he was lead up to the scratch, and sometimes fell without being struck; he did not appear in a fit state to continue the fight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long do you think he fought after he said he was not able? A. I think it must have been three quarters of an hour after, from what I heard, but I left in a quarter of an hour; I went out of the ring and laid down - I saw no more, but in three quarters of an hour after I left, he was brought out of the ring; I heard him groan - I was in the field all the time; I heard"Foul!" cried once; there were not a great many people there.</p>

            . I sell fruit, and live at Hampstead. I saw the latter part of the fight; it had began when I got up - I saw the deceased brought up to a place; he seemed very insensible, and not able to fight - the seconds brought him up to the scratch, and when they brought him up he seemed to lay his head on his second's shoulder - they had hold of him by the arm, and he leaned his head back on one of their shoulders, when he got to the scratch, before they left him; it was then said the battle was lost - the people rushed in; he was put into a coach, and taken away.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live at Hampstead. On the 27th of July, about half-past four o'clock, I saw the deceased at the Red Lion, in a perfect state of insensibility; I found bruises on his face, and blows about the eye - he had the usual symptoms of compression of the brain; I resorted to the usual remedies, but without effect - I had scarcely any hope of him: he died about five o'clock the next day - his head was opened in my presence, by Mr. Kearney, who is out of town: on the whole surface of the right hemisphere of the brain, there was from four to six ounces of blood effused, extravasated blood, on the surface of the brain, arising from a rupture of a vessel; that was quite sufficient to cause his death - a person falling repeatedly in pugilistic contest would be likely to occasion that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might the appearances have been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100029"/>occasioned by a fall, as well as a blow? A. They might.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might not the very excitement or action of fighting, when the powers of the brain are put to their greatest extent, occasion a rupture? A. It is possible; I attribute the death to the whole fight, in combination; the brain being in that state, one particular fall would then cause it - the greater the excitement the greater the predisposition.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, of Hampstead. I saw the deceased two hours after Mr. Stephenson, and was present at the opening of the head - I perfectly concur in his opinion; the blows and falls he received were quite sufficient to produce the extravasation of blood, which caused his death.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not a severe fall be sufficient to account for it? A. One alone might, but the circumstances altogether are more probable; one single fall might create the rupture, but which fall, I, of course, cannot say.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you known the prisoner long? A. No - he is a foreigner; I have seen him in the street - he appeared to have just got out of bed; I went into the house, and saw the woman sitting on a chair when Mr. Bond came - I was not near enough to smell her breath.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When on the chair did she appear sensible? A. No, she kept groaning as she did before.</p>

            . I am a beadle of St. George's, Hanover-square, Grosvenor-place district - King-street is in that district. On the 6th of August I was on duty in Queen-street, and was called, from the opposite side a few minutes to eleven o'clock, and found Mrs. Bryant, her son, and another woman standing there - I was informed that mischief was likely to happen at No. 3, King-street; I gave them a reply, and went into Queen-street again; a little after four o'clock in the morning, when I got to the watch-house in Robert's-buildings, two or three hundred yards from King-street, Weeks came to me, and I went with him to No. 3, King-street; we found the prisoner there, and about a dozen women - a woman laid on a bed on the ground floor very bad; the prisoner was sitting by the side of the bed, and said his wife would soon be better -Mrs. Myers was there, and kept rubbing her breast; she said, "Oh, my heart! oh, my belly! give me some water!" and, "Turn me, turn me!" she appeared in great pain -I could see her flesh rise up, she was swelling so fast; Myers then put her arm round her shoulder, and sat her up in bed; the prisoner did not leave till she died - he was by the side of the bed; Myers said to her, "Ann, how did this happen?" she answered, "It was father did it - he first ill-used me, and then threw me out of win<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100030"/>dow" - she asked her a second time, and then she said, looking at the prisoner as well as she could, and pointing to him, "It was you that did it - you first beat me, and then threw me out of window; you did it, so help me God!" the prisoner told her not to tell lies, for if she did she would not go to Heaven, she would go where they make horse-shoes - that is all that passed in my hearing; Myers said something to her about dying, which I do not recollect - she died about six o'clock, about an hour after this conversation; the prisoner said she had attempted to drown herself previous - that she had been drinking with other people the day before, and when he came home he had nothing but potatoes for dinner; this was after her death, when I went up stairs with him to get his things to take him to the watch-house, about half-past six o'clock - Mr. Martin had bled the deceased in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether the prisoner is a foreigner? A. He appeared so - his manner of expression was curious; I think the woman was too much in pain to be intoxicated - there were eight or twelve people in the room; I was about a yard and a half from the bed side - I cannot say whether she smelt of liquor, or not; there was a smell in the room as if there had been liquor there, but so many people were there I could not say who it was from - the prisoner was sitting on the bed side when I went in, and I should think sat there for an hour or more; he rose, and said he wanted to go backwards once - I told him to stop; he went backwards: he had neither coat nor waistcoat on - he had breeches or drawers on; I saw a man in the house, who appeared a foreigner - I sent him for a coach; I did not hear him called Francis - there were a good many people in the room; I saw no men but the prisoner and the foreigner.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When the prisoner went backwards, did you go with him? A. I went to the door, so that I could see him; the room that smelt was on the ground floor - he said she would soon get better, and he would make her answer for it; he slapped the side of her face, and kissed her repeatedly.</p>

             - we lived on the first floor front room, under the prisoner and deceased. On Friday morning, the 7th of August, about three o'clock, I heard the rattle - I awoke, lifted up the window, and the deceased was laying on the ground under our window, which is straight underneath the prisoner's; I had heard no previous noise - she groaned very much; I saw Weeks, and shortly after that I heard the prisoner come down stairs - I had not heard his window open; I had remained in my room all the time till he went down - I then went down, and saw the deceased brought in and placed on a chair; she spoke in a few minutes - the first thing she called out was,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God! Kennedy, you have murdered me;" he was present - I cannot say whether Weeks was there; a great many women were in the room - I assisted her as well as I could; the prisoner was down by the bed side - she was on a chair; he and I helped her on the bed - she had nothing on but her shift and a pair of stockings; no cap or handkerchief: she was about thirty-five years old - I stood by her till she died; I turned her often, because she called to me, "Jane, dear, turn me - oh, my back! oh, my heart!" that was her cry in the prisoner's presence, she was in such pain and agony - I do not think she would have said any thing, but I said, "Ann, my dear, like a good soul, will you be so good as to tell me how this happened, that you are in this state;" the prisoner sat by her at the time - she said,"Father done it;" she always called the prisoner father - I said, "Like a good soul, with the dying words in your mouth, be cautions what you are saying;" she said, Kennedy did it, so help her God, putting her hands together; I replied, "Ann, my dear, this is death and life, be very cautions what you say" - she replied quite sharp, "How often will I tell you, Kennedy done it;" she was an Irishwoman - he replied, "You blackguard, don't tell lies - if you do you will never go to Heaven, but your soul will go where they make horse-shoes;" nothing was said about her wounds, or her coming out of window - she said he beat her and ill-used her, and was so savage he threw her out of window; I am sure these are the words she used before he replied, "You blackguard, don't tell lies" - the prisoner at this time seemed very much in trouble about her; he sat patting her on the cheek and kissing her, very much in trouble, and cried very much - he seemed quite sober; Mr. Martin came between five and six o'clock, and heard what she said to me - she appeared in a dying state at the time she made these answers; she took death to her, and prayed to God to take her in mercy - she had not any appearance of being in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know whether she had been drinking the day before? A. I was out at work all day, and cannot tell; my husband works in the same factory as the prisoner - we sleep under the room they lived in; I had been in their room about seven o'clock in the evening - I think it was about half-past eleven when they went to bed; my husband went to bed before them, but it was twelve o'clock when I went - I cannot say whether she slept in her stockings; there are three rooms in the house; the prisoner cried very much, and seemed greatly distressed - Weeks came into the room when the deceased was brought in; he had to go to call the hour - she was put on the landlord's bed; my husband came down about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Mr. Martin was there when all this conversation took place; do you recollect at what time he came in? A. I should think about five o'clock, I cannot positively say - I was there when Mr. Bond came, between three and four; the deceased did not speak much then - her name was

            . I am watch-house keeper of Grosvenor-place district. On Friday morning, the 7th of August, about six o'clock, the prisoner was brought in by Southerwood; I asked what the offence was - he said in his presence, that he charged him with throwing his wife out of window; he was near enough to hear it - I knew him, and said "Kennedy how in the world did you come to do such a rash act;" he said"Oh, I was in a passion, Mr. Jones" - he was crying, laughing, and singing all the while he was in the prison, and he said he did not care about hanging himself, only his poor Nancy; but he did seem to know what he was about - I cannot tell all he said, he talked in such a manner.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Queen-street, Pimlico. I was sent for about half-past three o'clock in the morning; I saw the prisoner and deceased - she was in the parlour, on a chair, and was quite insensible; there was no external injury to be observed - I heard what had happened before I arrived, and she presented the appearance a person would under such circumstances; I spoke to her, but got no reply - she did not groan loud, but appeared suffering great pain, and to be seriously hurt internally; her eyes indicated internal injury - her pulse was very slow and weak; she was at that time not in a fit state to be bled - I did not bleed her, but ordered her to bed, and sent her medicine; I called again between eight and nine o'clock, and found she had expired about six - I then examined her body more particularly, it was very much swollen; there were some marks of bruises about her breast, and a slight bruise on one foot - if the lungs had been ruptured, and the air escaped through that rupture, it would account for the swelling; falling or being thrown from a second floor window was very likely to produce a rupture of the lungs - I believe the body was not opened at all - I have no doubt the violence received was the cause of her death; the prisoner appeared anxious about her state, and kissed her several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. And appeared in great distress of mind? A. He appeared anxious - I did not observe him cry; the cause of death was so evident, I did not think it necessary to open the body.</p>
               <p>Q. In cases of habitual drunkenness, and great excitement arising from that, have you not known blood-vessels to burst? A. I have not known such a case - it may have happened; but that would not rupture the lungs, and I am certain they were ruptured; it was evident, because the whole body was distended with air from the lungs; that could not be in the manner this was, without the lungs being ruptured - she had nothing but her shift and stockings on - I had a full opportunity of examining her body, there was no external mark at that time; if she had been beat, there would have been marks.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were the indications she presented such as a person would being treated as described? A. They were, except that she was not fractured.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would not the bursting of a blood vessel occasion those appearances? A. No; I have no doubt her being thrown out of window occasioned her death - if she had been thrown out with violence I should have expected to have found bones broken.</p>
               <p>Q. If she had fallen without violence, should you have expected it? A. It is impossible to say - I have known a man fall ninety feet without breaking any bones; a man fell from the clock of St. Martin's church.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. If you had bled her when you first went, would it have tended to hasten her death? A. It would; she would never have recovered her senses if she had been bled at that moment, for her pulse was scarcely perceptible - she was very cold, and the pupil of the eye dilated; I considered it a fatal case from the first moment.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could a rupture of the lungs have taken place without perforation by a fractured rib? A. It is very possible to have happened without it; the concussion might do it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Eden-square, Pimlico. On the 7th of August, about six o'clock in the morning, I was desired to attend, and saw the prisoner and deceased; her face, neck, chest, and abdomen were very much swollen - she appeared sensible, and had a natural pulse; she presented appearances which might be expected in a person being thrown, or having fallen from some height; I attribute the swollen appearance of her body to a rupture of the lungs - I did not conceive medical aid could save her life; I bled her in half an hour, as re-action had taken place - I did it to prevent inflammation; the pulse had quickened from seventy to ninety - I was sure inflammation would follow such an occurrence.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Might not a pulse be quick from irritation and debility as well as inflammation? A. Yes, it might be quick from irritability - when I first saw her there was not great nervousness and debility.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You made no internal examination? A. No; I attribute her death to a rupture of a blood vessel in the abdominal cavity as well as the lungs -I think it very likely to have been the mesenteric artery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you mean before by saying you attributed her death to the rupture of the lungs? A. I attribute the swollen state of the body to the rupture of the lungs; the air escaping from the lungs would occasion the swelling of the body - I attribute her death to the rupture of the artery in the abdominal cavity.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If the artery you speak of was ruptured, would bleeding tend to remedy it? A. It would not.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How much blood did you take? A. About eight ounces; my object was to prevent inflammation - I had no notion of a rupture of the abdominal artery then; the blood I took from her could in no ways contribute to the immediate cause of her death - if I had known a blood vessel was ruptured I do not think I should have taken the eight ounces of blood; if the case occurred again I should not bleed - I do not think it in any way hastened her death; if the case occurred again, and I had been aware of the circumstances, I should not have done it - I should be guided by the state of the pulse and the state of the woman; I do not think bleeding would do good when an artery is ruptured; I examined her body - no bone was fractured; her eye was closed with the swelling - I tried to open it, but could not; she had a fair natural pulse; I had not seen Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you first saw her was she sensible? A. She appeared so - I considered her case fatal from the first; I have no reason to know whether she thought so - I did not hear the conversation between her and Mrs. Myers - I was there rather more than an hour; I left the room twice, for about five minutes; I had no conversation with her as to what had happened; she complained of a violent pain at the chest and belly - I did not tell her she could not recover, nor give her hopes of recovery - I did not hear her say any thing to the prisoner; he now and then asked how she felt, and appeared very anxious.</p>
               <p>MR. BOND. I considered it a hopeless case from the first; her pulse was by no means natural when I saw it.</p>

            . I am the wife of Thomas Bishop, a watchman, and live at No. 7, King-street, opposite the prisoner. On the morning of the 7th of August, I was awoke by a cry of Murder! from a female voice, and after that I heard something fall like a parcel of flower pots; I then heard a rattle spring; I looked out of window directly- my bed-room window faces the prisoner's; I saw nothing of him; I saw the watchman come to the body, and say,"What is this! here is a naked woman" - Kennedy was then at his own window; I saw him at the window, but did not see him come to it, nor hear it open; he said,"What is the matter, is that you Nance? she is my wife;" and then he said, "Good God! how came she there, I was fast asleep in bed - I undressed her last night and put her to bed, and we went to bed together" - I then saw him strike a light; he came down stairs; I went into the room afterwards; the cill of the window comes up to about my breast; the deceased was rather taller than me, and rather stout.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home to dinner: my wife was drunk; I had to run back to my work for fear of quarrelling with her; this was the Wednesday night before; Mrs. Myers came up and offered to lend me a shilling; I and my wife were in bed: I said "I don't want it," but my wife might put the shilling on the table, and she did; in the night we began to quarrel about the shilling: I said,"I must go to work in the morning, you go and give her the shilling back again in the morning." Well, next day she and Myers were drunk together, and in the evening, when I came home, my wife was drunk again; the tea-things were on the table; I was afraid she would throw them down, and I undressed her and put her to bed: I went out with Myers, and had two pints of beer at different places, and I thought I would take my wife a pint home, supposing she was sober. Well, she came and met me round the corner, and called me a blackguard; I said"Come home, here is a pint of beer;" she came home and sent for half a gallon of beer; I went out afterwards for another pot; I got her to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, and about four, I always used to call her - I said"Ann, did you hear the watchman call out, for I must be up at five." Well, I felt in the bed and she was gone; I said, "Now she will get to her foolish tricks again, and hide herself;" she had gone to the water-side four times to drown herself; she had been married before to a Dutchman, who ran away from her, because she was always drunk. I could do no work when I came to this house, this woman of mine was always drunk with Mrs. Myers, for she would make her sell the last shift she had on, and has stolen my wife's money from her pocket when she was drunk; I could not keep the woman sober, but that was all the fault of that woman; she sold all my furniture for 7s. 6d. which was worth 3l. 10s., and that woman robbed her of the money; she was always beastly drunk in the street.</p>

            . I am a physician, and have been so nearly nineteen years - I have heard the evidence of both the medical gentlemen, and gave it all the attention in my power. I should say decidedly that the cause of the woman's death could not be ascertained without a post mortem examination.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you come here at the prisoner's desire? A. I came here accidentally, and sent the prisoner's counsel a note, disagreeing with the whole of their opinion.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have heard the situation in which the woman was found, having either fallen or been thrown out of window, and no account of any illness before, and have heard what the appearances were at this time? A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state that you have any doubt whether being thrown out of window was the cause of her death? A. Such a cause would certainly produce death very rapidly; but as the body was not opened, and whatever violence was done seems to have been internal, and the body not opened, no man can draw any positive inference as to what was the injury; I should suspect her death arose from the fall, but not be able positively to ascribe it to that.</p>

            . I saw the deceased at nine o'clock on the morning before her death, intoxicated, and saw her at six in the evening in the same state; the prisoner was not at home then - I gave her a glass of spirits that night, for she had teased me all day for it; this was about half-past three in the afternoon - I afterwards went out with the prisoner; we had half-a-gallon of beer together, between six and seven; he brought a pot home into my room for Harris - she took part of it; they staid there drinking till about half-past nine, and went to bed at a quarter to twelve - their bed-room is immediately over mine; I heard them going to bed - I could hear footsteps; I heard no quarrelling in the night.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. At what hour did you go to sleep? A. I suppose about a quarter past twelve. I was awoke in the morning by my wife and daughter shouting out that Ann was thrown out of window; I did not hear the rattle spring, nor any cry of murder.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave a drunken woman spirits? A. She teased me so long for it, I gave her two-pence to buy it; I got up immediately after the alarm, and was in the par<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100033"/>lour where the woman lay for about ten minutes - I went away at half-past five to go to work - I had got up about half-past three; I was in my own room all the time, except for about ten minutes - my wife was in the room with the deceased; she was sober - I did not hear her say any thing to the deceased, or the deceased say any thing to her; I was not in the room then - she was groaning when I was there - I saw Mr. Martin; I suppose a dozen people were in the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did your wife and daughter say? A."Murder, murder! Ann is thrown out of window!" They were in my room then; they awoke me telling me so - they were clapping their hands and shouting out; my wife had opened the window, it seems, to look out - she was naked.</p>

not Sullivan; I had followed the two from Holborn-bridge - I had not power to take the

On the 31st of August, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner in the shop - he asked for some calico, which I served him with; it came to 1s. 4d. - he had a bag which he put down on the ground by the side of the counter - while I was folding up the calico, another customer came in and inquired for an article; a youth named Sills came to attend to that customer; I desired him to fold up the calico and attend to the prisoner while I waited on the customer; the prisoner then asked for some fine twist sheeting; I went three or four yards to fetch it, and when I returned with it he had left the shop - I do not know whether he had paid for the calico; I missed a roll of about fifty yards of gros de Naples off the counter almost immediately - it laid on the part of the counter where he stood; there was nobody near enough to take it but him, except a female, and the prisoner stood between her and the silk, as such she could not take it - I had seen her at the shop before but did not know her; she remained there till after the loss was discovered - she had no bag; the prisoner's bag would contain the silk easily - I immediately sent the clerk to look for the prisoner, but he was not found; on the Wednesday or Thursday following I saw him in custody, and recognized him as the man who came for the calico, before I knew he was custody - I have no doubt of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many customers were in the shop? A. There were three or four<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100034"/>in the inside of the shop, but none but the female on that side to the best of my recollection - there was not more than three or four customers - I will swear there were not eight persons in the shop exclusive of shopmen; I believe there were two or three in the shop at the time I missed the silk, one or two had left; the woman had no cloak on, if she had I should have noticed it; I swear she had a handkerchief or shawl on, but did not notice her dress, but am positive she had no cloak, or shawl on or I should have noticed it; I think I should know every body who came with a cloak on if I waited on them; I turned my back to the prisoner to reach down the article he asked for - I had told Sills to wait on him, and receive the cash from him - but before I left him to wait on another customer he asked for this article, and while I was reaching it he left in a precipitate manner; I was informed he had paid for what he had - my back was turned about an eighth of a minute - Sills was with him at that time, and went in pursuit; the woman did not leave for some time after - I attended on her afterwards - she might have been in the shop for five minutes; I saw nobody leave the part of the shop the silk was laying in except the prisoner, but my attention was called to another part of the shop - it was impossible for any body to cross the shop and take the silk during the short time my back was turned - it is six or seven yards across; the silk has never been found.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. It was rather a large package, could a woman, without a cloak, conveniently conceal it? A. Impossible; she must have been observed if she had it- she bought several articles, and did not go till she was suited.</p>

            . I am cashier at Mr. Poole's. I saw the prisoner in the shop when he first came in; master served him - when the shopmen are busy I serve, but not generally; the prisoner paid me for something, but what he bought I do not know - he had a parcel which I gave him, and a bag; I could not observe whether it had any thing in it - Mr. Wilson missed the silk in less than half a minute; I had observed several rolls of silk on the counter, and could not tell one was gone - I immediately went out after the prisoner, but could not see him; I had observed his person - he was close to me; I saw him again about four days after, and am quite sure of him - the woman stood at the counter near the prisoner; no other customer was at that counter - there was a counter at the end of the shop, and two are opposite each other; nobody crossed the shop from the time I saw the prisoner there, till he left the shop, I am certain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Wilson called you over to take the money from the prisoner? A. I came to serve the other customer; he said I had better take the money from the prisoner - I was perhaps two yards from him or less at that time; Wilson turned to reach something - my face was turned towards the prisoner; I had an opportunity of seeing him - I did not see his bag till he was going out - I could not see it across the counter; I did not see him take the silk - he could have taken it without my seeing him, and put it into his bag; I am sixteen years old - I swear he might have pulled the silk off the counter while I was looking at him, and I not see him; I cannot swear he did do it - I did not notice what he was doing particularly; I know I have sworn I was looking at him, but still he might take it without my seeing him - I can see across the counter, but not underneath it; it was between me and him - the roll of silk might be between half a yard and yard long; I think I had seen the prisoner in the shop once before, and have seen the woman more that once - I cannot say how often; I have been there about a month - the woman had a black bombazeen or stuff frock or gown, or something on, and a child in her arms; she had no cloak, for I saw her frock and she had nothing to cover it - she was the person I was called to serve; I do not know what she bought, for I went out to look for the prisoner - I cannot say whether the bag contained any thing, he went out so fast; there was a roller in the silk, and it was rather bulky - it was a middling sized bag.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you not have observed the silk in it? A. He was close to the door, and went out in a quick manner - I do not know whether the woman was searched; I cannot say how many persons were in the shop.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any body at the counter where the silk lay, except the prisoner and the woman? A. No.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Monday, the 31st of August, Mr. Poole came to me - I got a description of the prisoner from Sills, and on Friday morning he was driving up the City-road in a gig - I stopped him, took him to Mr. Poole's and asked some person there whether he could give us a better description of the man than I had before; the prisoner was with me - we then went up stairs to the bed-room where Mr. Wilson was ill in bed; I asked him if he could give us a description of the person supposed to have taken the silk - Mr. Wilson neither said the prisoner was or was not the man; I did not tell him the prisoner was in custody - he described the man as he had before; Sills was not in the way - I went to Guildhall and desired the prosecutor to bring Sills there, and as I and the prisoner stood at the Justice room I saw Sills coming - I told the prisoner to go in, and directly Sills came he pointed to the prisoner and said, "That is the man;" he did not know he was in custody - I had not told any body of it; the prisoner denied the charge in toto.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He went with you to the shop? A. Yes; he drove me there in the gig.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hope you will consider the awful situation I am placed in, if any gentleman here resembled the person who took the silk it would be a disgrace to him as well as me - if I had been guilty I should never have let the officer come in my gig and drive him to the door; we went to the gentleman's bed-room and asked him if he could swear to the man who took the silk - he said he could not, having no recollection of him; a woman in the shop said the person was very much like a Jew - they said he was not, and the woman said "I will have it that he was;" she was asked if she could swear to him; she said she could - she pointed to me, and said it was a man a little taller than that man.</p>

            . I live next door to the prosecutor. I heard a noise, and saw these two prisoners bring the geese along; I thought I knew them to be Yewers; I saw the prisoners so as to distinguish their persons - Ottaway was the one nearest to me; I went and called Baker; he came out - the prisoners ran, and Baker pursued; I am quite sure they are the men - it was moonlight, and Ottaway was not out of my sight.</p>

            . I was called out, and saw the prisoners just making a start to run: they ran through the gate, and I called to them to stop; Ottaway said, "I shan't stop," and ran on about ten yards farther - Collison jumped over a gate into a plantation; I pursued Ottaway - he said he would beat my brains out, and struck me over the head with a stick; he struck at me a second time; I caught it on my arm, seized him, and took the stick from him - I brought him back to the prosecutor's, and asked him if he was not ashamed to rob a poor man, who only had 12s. 6d. a week; I then went and took Collison in the plantation; he could not get out any other way - I am quite certain he is the man I saw get over; I was within two yards of him.</p>

               <p>Ottaway's Defence. I did not strike him. I had been to look for work, and met a friend, who took me into a public-house, and this young man came in - we were going along the road, and I never went out of the road.</p>
               <p>Collison's Defence I had been travelling all day for work, and went into the public-house, and saw this man - we had rather a drop too much, and stopped late; I went on, and kicked against this bit of chain on the side of the road - the geese were on the side of the road; we did not drive them.</p>

I keep the Queen's Arms; the prisoner lived with me; the prosecutor had lodged at my house, and asked me to let his things remain there; I said certainly; he returned in August; the prisoner was still in my service; he asked me that Monday to allow the prisoner to give him his things; I told her to go and fetch them - she said she would - I told her twice, and in the evening she told me he had got them; but on the Tuesday he said he had not - I told her to go and fetch them down; she said they were in his own room; I told her to go and fetch them - she did not, and I told the other servant to go; the prisoner then brought down the jacket and trousers - I said "Here is not all" - she then said Ellen, the other servant, had pawned them, and had the money; I said I should send an officer for Ellen, to make her restore them - Ellen came and met the prisoner in my house in the officer's presence - while he was there the prisoner's mother brought the shirts and the handkerchief.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Then the prisoner did bring down the jacket and trousers? A. Yes, and told me the things had been pawned by

            . I am a watchman. On the morning of the 18th of August, Brandsgrove told me he saw three men; I went and saw two of them by the horse-trough, and the other opposite, near the spot where the sack was pulled out of the ditch - Woodward was standing near the ditch; the sack contained three geese, which I shewed to Holt, who claimed them - the prisoners were afterwards given up to me, and I locked them up; I saw them run away - Hicks asked me if he should follow them, and I said Yes; they were brought back in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; Hicks brought Samvell, and the others were brought back about the same time.</p>

I went into the shop on the Saturday night; this gentleman was standing at the counter with his handkerchief half out of his pocket; I said,"Your handkerchief is hanging out." Mr. Reynolds was selling bacon, and he wanted to pretend that I wanted to steal some, but I did not; and then the prosecutor said I wanted to pick his pocket; and when before the Magistrate he told the gentleman to say I wanted to take it out of his pocket.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner pawned these things with me, between six and nine o'clock in the evening; I have known him fifteen months  - he frequently pawned things for different people in the neighbourhood; he said these things were pawned for a Mrs. Shepherd, to make up her rent - I do not know that he ever pawned plate with me before, but he has pawned very good articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the neighbours for whom he has pawned them? A. No; he said Mrs. Shepherd lodged at No. 3, Drury-lane - I knew him, and knew his mother - I had no suspicion of him; his parents, I believe, keep a house, but I am not certain of it; the things he pawned have generally been redeemed again.</p>

On the 20th of July, about half past three o'clock in the morning, I was riding down Highgate-hill, and saw Bradbury coming out of a field with a sack; he saw me and returned into the field; Davis then came out with a sack, and I asked what he had got there; he made no answer - I took the sack and found it was harness - I gave him to a watchman, then went and took the other prisoner; I found this other sack in a privy near where he was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Davis. Q. What was found in my sack? A. The riding saddle and bridle - I brought Bradbury out of the field before I took his sack.</p>

I went out and saw a man in my passage, but I did not know then that a robbery had been committed - the prisoner said another man gave it him to carry - I asked the other man what he wanted there; he said to buy some mahogany - I said I did not sell it; then my man came and said a man had gone off with a plank.</p>

On the 29th of July he was not selling any thing, but the property was in the auction-room; I saw the prisoner in the room, and about half-past five o'clock I saw him take up a plated waiter, put it under his coat, and turn to walk out - I called to Mr. Bullock's man, and asked him if he saw the man take the waiter; he said,"No, stop him." I followed him up Southampton-street; I called Stop thief! and saw him take it out of his coat, and throw it down an area - I followed him to Silver-street, and brought him back; he said, "What is the matter?" -I said, "There is not much the matter, but you must go back with me."

Yes; there were four or five persons there - I did not particularly notice him while he was in the room, but I can swear he is the man; I did not lose sight of him after he left the room - I suppose it was found about fifty yards from where it was taken; I swear this is the waiter - it was given me from the area; I suppose the prisoner went twenty yards from the area before he was taken - I do not know that this is the one he threw down.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Was your attention directed to her? A. Yes, perhaps more from the person she was with, than from her own conduct; I did not charge her with it when she stooped down - we let her go away to be sure of the matter; I knew she had taken something - she was then about two yards from the door; I do not recollect these gloves, but I had seen some gloves on the counter - when she returned she produced these, and said she picked them up at the door; there is nothing on the gloves that I can swear to.</p>

            . I was serving in the shop - I saw the three women come in; I began to show them some silk, and then another young man took them - I stood opposite, putting away some goods; I saw some gloves on the counter were pulled off in some way, but I cannot say how - the prisoner stood opposite them; I saw her stoop - I do not know what she picked up; the others paid for what they had - when they went out I followed them, and overtook the prisoner; I asked her to walk back with me - she came back and produced the gloves, which she said she picked up at the threshold of the door - I believe they are my master's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the three persons staud together? A. No, a little distance; there was no one else near enough to pull the gloves off.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH WILLIAMS. I am an officer, and took the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. You have not said that now? A. I did not tell the Magistrate I was positive of the prisoner; I know her, and know she lived with the prosecutrix; I do not remember the circumstance, though I know I did take the note, because I have written the prosecutrix's name on it, and said at the office I believed I did take it of the prisoner, and I do believe I received it from her - I wrote on it, "Mrs. Rochester, 12, Southampton-buildings," this is the note(looking at it) I have put that name on it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the person who took it come behind you or meet you? A. He met me; it had a double chain, and was pulled away with a tremendous pull; he gave a tremendous pull before he got away - it was not a sudden snatch but a wrench; my arm was very sore afterwards, for some time the clasp of the chain broke - he got the reticule, and rushed away with it - I called Stop thief! and he called Stop thief himself! somebody then came behind, struck me on the back, and made a catch at me, to prevent my running in pursuit, but he was taken directly on the spot, without being out of my sight; he is the man -I am quite sure of it - it happened on Sunday evening; my purse was found on the Wednesday following, over a garden wall, which the prisoner passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I take it for granted you were very much agitated? A. I was - I had never seen him before; it was done momentarily - there was a person standing at a door as I passed round the corner, and her brother pursued him; I had to turn a corner in following him, but did not lose sight of him.</p>

I was in Dean-street, standing at my father's door; I heard a cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running and calling Stop thief! his hat dropped off - he did not stop to pick it up, so I thought he was the thief himself - he was coming towards me; I told him if he did not stop I would knock him down - he paid no attention to that -I ran after him up Dean-street and laid hold of him, but missed my hold; I secured him at the top of Dean-street; he said he had done nothing, he was not the thief, and was very resolute to get away - I held him, and said,"What as he robbed;" the lady said he was the man immmediately; I took him into a public-house, as the rest of the persons round said I should not illuse him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were not a good many persons behind pursuing him? A. Several were running after him, calling Stop thief! whether that hid him from the lady I cannot say - I did not see her till she came up to me - if I had let my hat fall I should have stopped to pick it up- I kept very close to him; there was nobody between him and me, I swear - I did not see him do any thing; the others were all just behind him when I first met him.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Langley,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100051"/>in Kent; the deceased, Thomas Brandrith, lodged with me at the time of his death, and occasionally for years before - he came last the latter end of August, 1828; he had been in the army. He had been with me three weeks; on the 13th of September, 1828, he came home to his lodging, at ten o'clock that night, fell forward out of his chair, and almost immediately expired: I knew the prisoner; he is a pensioner, and lived about forty roods off; he had been in the army, and was acquainted with the deceased - I went to his house, and told him what had happened; he and his wife came back with me to my house, stopped there all night, and left about six o'clock; after they were gone I found two keys belonging to the deceased, and took them to the prisoner's house - the deceased had a portmanteau at his house; I gave him the keys - he asked me to go up stairs, and see the portmanteau unlocked; I went up with him; he unlocked it, and opened it in my presence with one of the keys I took; it was searched in my presence, and two papers found in it, which appeared about the size of a letter; Suffolk did not appear to take any notice of them - he did look at them, and said they were Brandrith's soldiering papers; I did not see any other papers in the portmanteau; (looking at a will produced by 
               <persName id="t18290910-110-person1068">J. </persName>
            Beams) I saw no paper of this sort found in the portmanteau - I saw it emptied; there was some wearing-apparel and things, and two sovereigns.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suffolk was an acquaintance of Brandrith's? A. Yes; he was with him almost every day, and only came to my house to sleep - he came down from year to year to visit him; I have seen him there for years; and I believe he slept with me, because Suffolk had no place for him to sleep; the prisoner asked me to go up to see the portmanteau opened; he looked at the papers carelessly, and said they were soldiering papers.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at this paper folded up as it is, can you undertake to swear it was not among them? A. I cannot; the things were turned out of the box, and put in again - some were not taken out; I believe they were all turned over, and all moved; but some might not be taken out - it was a leather portmanteau, lined with paper, I think; I think the lid was lined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any search made in the lining of the lid? A. I cannot say that I saw any part of the lid open - Suffolk took the two sovereigns; I do not know that he paid for the funeral; all the time I knew Suffolk and Brandrith they seemed very friendly, and always walked about the common together - I was with them but very little; Brandrith never told me what he or his family were; I never heard him say what he meant to do with his property after his death - I knew a man named Whyman in the neighbourhood; I fancy he has been a schoolmaster; I do not know that he used to do writing for the neighbours - he lived at Sutton Valence, and has gone away; I do not know that search has been made for him - people have been enquiring after him: I never heard of his being found.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What sort of a lining had the portmanteau; do I understand that it was lined with paper? A. The sides and the bottom; I think the inside of the lid was lined with cloth, or something - I went up at the prisoner's desire to search it.</p>

            , ESQ. I live at Langley, and know the prisoner; he came to me early on the Sunday morning as the deceased died on the Saturday night, and asked if it was necessary to have a Coroner; I told him he must have one, on hearing the particulars of the man's death - I asked if he knew any thing of the deceased; he said he did, that he was an old comrade of his; I asked whether he had any property - he said, "Yes, considerable." I asked what he meant by that - whether it was any thing he derived an income from, or if it was property; he said he had property in the Bank of England -I then asked if he knew whether he had left any will; he said No - I asked if he had any near relations that he knew of; he said he had a sister, and he believed she lived in the City of Chester - that he knew her maiden name, but did not know her name now; I told him she ought to be informed of his death, as the property was hers - he said of course the property was hers; he then said, the weather was hot, and the man must be buried, there was not time to give her the information, for he would not keep, and as there was sufficient property to bury him; he would bury him, and when they came, if they liked to pay him the expenses of burying him, he would give them up the property, which I understood was the money and different things which were found - this was about half-past eight o'clock in the morning; we always breakfast at eight, and were at breakfast when he came - he said he would write to the sister, and went away; I saw him again on the 1st of June this year; I had met him once before that in the road, near Christmas, and asked if he had ever had any answer from Brandrith's sister; he said No, the letter had been returned to him from the returned letter office, as they could not find her - I asked if he ought not to take other means to endeavour to find her out; he said he would write again - this was, I think, two or three days before Christmas; I recollect nothing more passing then. On the 1st of June Mr. Matheson came to me with a letter of introduction from Manchester; I went with him to Masely's house - he wished for information about the death, and to see Masely and the witnesses attesting the will, of which he shewed me a copy; while we were at Masely's, Suffolk came up to the door - I said to Mr. Matheson, "There is the man himself;" Matheson at first said he would not take any notice of him - he afterwards said to me, "I think I may as well at once;" he then called to him and asked whether he had not taken some money under a will of Brandrith - he said he had, that Brandrith had made a will, by which he had made him whole and sole executor, and left him all his property; that he had administered to that will, and had taken more than 300l. from the Bank of England - I then said to him, "How do you account for this? you told me Brandrith had made no will, and now you say he has made a will, leaving you executor and all his property?" he was very much confused, and hesitated for some time - at last he said, "I know I did, I did not then know that there was a will;" we asked him how long it was after Brandrith's death that he found the will - he said it was about a month; I said to him, "It is very extraordinary the will should bear date on the 28th of August, and he die on the 13th of September, and you living in so small a cottage, he should not tell you any thing about it, and that you should not know any thing about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100052"/>it;" we then asked him who made the will; he said he did not know that he was bound to tell - Mr. Matheson said he did not know that he was bound to tell, but he would most likely be made to tell in some other place, if he would not tell him; we pressed him very much to tell who made the will, and he said to Mr. Matheson, "I should like to know who you are;" he said, "I am an attorney at Manchester; I am sent here by the deceased's sister: and unless you like to give up the money I shall take proceedings against you, and very briskly" - he said he did not wish to hurry him, he might take his time about it and should confer with Messrs. Hoare and Beal, whom he should appoint his agents; Matheson asked him several times after, I should think a dozen times, to tell who made the will, and then we left him and went away - we asked if he could bring any respectable person forward who was present and saw the will made or any thing of that sort, but he would not give any answer - I do not think any inquiry was made of him respecting the witnesses; Saturday following (the 6th) I went to his house and told him I had received a letter from Mr. Matheson, wishing me to ask him two questions and he must do as he pleased about answering them; I would read the questions as they were written in the letter - one question was, at what precise time he wrote to the sister of the late Mr. Brandrith, and how and when he learned that the letter had been returned; he said he wrote on the Sunday, the day after the poor man died; that he got Rouse to write, and did not write himself; that he did not know the date of the return of the letter, but it was some considerable time (he told us in the conversation, on the 1st of June, with Mr. Matheson that when he found the will it was between the lid of the trunk and the lining, and about a month after the deceased's death - I asked him whether it was probable a man, who had made an instrument like a will, which was only to come in use after his death, would hide it where it most probably never would be found; he made no reply) - the second question I was to ask him was, "How long after Mr. Brandrith's decease it was when he found the will, as he stated, under the lid of the trunk?" he said he thought it was more than a month; he then asked me some questions about the matter- I told him I had no doubt Mr. Matheson would proceed against him, and that he knew best about the will, if it was a genuine will; he had better produce the witnesses or those who saw it made, that he might avoid getting into trouble, as I did not know in what way Mr. Matheson would proceed, but I thought most probably by a warrant - I told him if Mr. Matheson proceeded by an action against him it would put him to a considerable expense, even if the will was correct; he said a law suit would ruin him, he had better give up the money - he asked me for Mr. Matheson's address, which I gave him; I asked if he could told me the name of the sister, as I had forgotten it, though Mr. Matheson had told me- he immediately said her name was Makin, but I am not quite certain whether Mr. Matheson did not tell him her name on the 1st of June.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you and Mr. Matheson first saw him you did not tell him, in the first instance, who Mr. Matheson was? A. No; I have not stated the conversation quite exact in point of time - he was asked who made the will full a dozen times; he was asked two or three times before Mr. Matheson told him who he was, and several times after - he asked who Mr. Matheson was before he was told he would be made to tell who made the will.</p>
               <p>Q. It was on some interference of Mr. Matheson that he asked who he was? A. Yes; he asked the prisoner two or three times who made the will, and then the prisoners said, "I should like to know who you are?" but he was also asked after that who made the will.</p>
               <p>Q. Finding he was an attorney who came to claim the property, he declined answering him some question? A. Yes; it was after Matheson told him who he was that he said he should proceed pretty briskly - he answered both the questions I put to him from Matheson's letter; I know Whyman by sight; he can write, but not very well - I believe he has been in several different businesses; he has been rather unfortunate; the only thing I know of his having written is a notice, but not in very good writing - I believe he has left the neighbourhood entirely.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Repeat the answer Mr. Matheson gave when asked who he was? A."I am an attorney of Manchester, and am sent here by the sisters of the deceased to inquire about the will;" Suffolk said "I only knew he had one sister" - whether either of their names were mentioned, I do not know.</p>

            . I am an auctioneer, and live at Sutton Valence. I was employed to bury the deceased; the prisoner gave me the directions for the funeral, he said if I would do it he would see that I should be paid - he knew Mr. Brandrith had died worth property, and he would see the expenses paid - he said he supposed there would be a will found, by which he expected the property would come to him, but if it was otherwise, the deceased had a sister living near Chester, and he wished me to write her (looking at a letter produced by the prisoner's counsel) this is the letter I wrote by his desire; it is written as from myself, and was returned to me from the post-office - (read.)</p>

            . The prisoner's letters are al<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100053"/>ways left at my house - I broke this open myself - Langley is the adjoining parish to Sutton Valence; I was in the habit of seeing him frequently, almost daily - he came to me four or five days after the letter was sent, to know if I had received an answer; and so he did day by day - the letter was returned about a month after it was sent - I told him it was returned, and gave it him; a very few days after the letter was returned, he said if his sister was living, and there was no will, the property would belong to her - but he said he thought he knew the place where the deceased's trunks were in London, and he should go to London and see if it could be found there; he said he knew one place where there was a trunk, but he thought there were two or three different places where he had trunks.</p>

               <p>Q. At the time he talked of going to London to search the trunk there, did he say any thing about the trunk at his own house? A. He said he had searched the trunk at his own house, but could find nothing there in the shape of a will; he said he should go to London to search the trunks, to see if he could find a letter to tell where the sister lived, if she was living; I cannot fix a date to this conversation; it was not many days after the return of the letter - he told me afterwards that he had been to London; I saw him on his return - I should think he had been absent a fortnight - he told me he could find no will; he paid me for the funeral after he returned from London; and when he paid me, I told him I was surprised how he could obtain the money without a will, as he told me he had got 380l. from the Bank; he had been to London twice; after he had been the first time I gave him a paper which I wrote; it was merely an account of what I had heard Mr. Brandrith say respecting him, both in his presence and out of it - I gave it him at his own request; and after he received that paper he went to London a second time; some time after that he paid me for the funeral - I do not think that was for nearly three months after the decease; he paid me about 14l., including money I had lent him - in answer to my question, how he got the money without a will, he said there was no will, but the paper I gave him was as good as a will; he said he had been at a great expence and trouble in getting the money - I think he stated he had received the 380l. from the Bank, both at this conversation and before- I saw him afterwards; he said it was very strange the sister had not written nor come up, as she must have heard of her brother's death; but he understood they were not very good friends - he came to me about the beginning of last June, and told me there had been a solicitor down respecting Mr. Brandrith's will; I said, "I thought you always told me there was no will" - he said there was a will - that Whyman had made a will - he asked me where Whyman was; I told him I had put him in possession, under a distress for rent, at Tunely - he was occasionally employed by me; he said he should go down and see him; (it is about twelve miles off) he came back next day, and told me he had been down and seen Whyman; I know Whyman's hand-writing; I have often seen him write (looking at the will) - I believe this to be Whyman's hand-writing; it is not the hand he usually writes; but it is his hand-writing, I am sure.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do I understand that you knew the deceased and the prisoner both? A. I knew them both very well; he was on particularly intimate terms with the prisoner, and came down every year to pass some time at his cottage; they lived and boarded together on the most intimate terms - they frequently came to my house, which is a public-house, and it was always a matter of indifference who paid; I am a publican as well as an auctioneer - they frequently talked of the services they had been in together abroad; and I heard they were in the same corps.</p>
               <p>Q. You communicated something he had said both in Suffolk's presence and out of it; was it not that he should leave Suffolk all he had in the world? A. No; Brandrith, when he was down the year before, told me he should stop about a fortnight longer in the country; he lodged at my house - he came home that night, and said he should go home next day - I said, "Why you said you were not going home?" he said, "Yes; but I cannot bear to stay here to see that poor Jem in such misery for the money he has lost by Boddin - I have told him not to grieve; I will take care of him as long as I am alive, and if I die I will take care of him; I am going home now to arrange my affairs" - this was in 1827 - he did not say when he should return to Sutton Valence; I saw him when he returned the following year - he lodged at my house then, and repeated the same sort of conversation respecting his intention towards Suffolk; I have heard him say the same sort of things several times, and one night in particular - when he gave Suffolk's wife his watch, he said, "Sally, when you hear I am dead, come and take my watch, it was given me by Lord Barrington; I should like to wear it all my life, and after I am dead it is your's;" he said Suffolk and him, between them. had money enough to bring them to their graves' end comfortably - he could not bear to see Mrs. Suffolk dragging about the leasing-field, when there was no occasion for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say Mrs. Suffolk would have his watch, and the rest of his property would go to Suffolk? A. I do not think he ever said the whole of his property - he always said he should take care of Suffolk, he should secure Suffolk; I do not think he ever said he would leave him the whole of his property - he said Jem would have his property, or he should take care of him; I know it was his intention that Suffolk should have his property - he told me and my wife so when he has been talking to us; he has said he should give Suffolk property, but I do not think he ever said the whole of his property - I will not say, I have not stated that he said all his property should go to him, nor will I say Brandrith did not say so; I think it was before the prisoner's first journey that he told me he was going to London to look for letters to find the sister's direction - and on his return, I think he told me he had not got access to the trunks at all; I do not speak from dates, I only recollect this as a general conversation - I merely conjecture that it might be three months after the decease that he paid me.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you Whyman had made a will - did he not, in the same conversation, say Whyman said he had made the will? A. Yes; he said Whyman told him he had made a will; but I said, "If there are any secrets in it don't tell me;" he said, "There are no secrets on my part;"<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100054"/>I told him it had been said about the place that I had made the will - that I was out of it, and wished to keep out of it; I wanted to hear nothing about it; he said Whyman told him he had made the will for Brandrith, but I do not recollect any day being mentioned when it was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Suffolk mentioned it as a matter Whyman had told him, not as knowing it himself? A. No; it was what Whyman had told him; I know Whyman very well - I believe he was always about that part of the country, not exactly at Sutton, but in the neighbourhood; he formerly kept a school; I do not know what has become of him now, I do not think he can be found - I have looked after him; I saw him on Sunday, the 15th of June, for the last time; I think Suffolk was in custody then, but am not sure; I told the constable if they wanted Whyman I knew where to find him; they said they did not want him; on the very day Suffolk was sent from Maidstone to London I met Mr. Makin, and said if he wanted Whyman I could find him; he said he did not want him that he knew of, there was nothing against him; the constable, I know, told me there was nothing against him.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the 15th of June the last time you saw Whyman? A. It was; I gave the prisoner a paper to the purport of the conversation I have stated relative to the disposal of the property; I was paid nothing for my trouble in drawing this paper - I received 3l. from him besides the funeral bill; I had been laying out of my money a long time; I charged him the same as was paid - I had not lent him the 3l. - it was for laying out of money, and I had lent him money; he made me a present of the 3l. as a compliment for that; it was a long time after I gave him the paper.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You charged for the funeral exactly what the undertaker charged? A. I did; if it had been any body else I should have had a profit, but as I knew him I expected he would give me something without it; the 3l. had nothing to do with the paper.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You stated, that in June he inquired where Whyman was, and you told him at Tunely? A. Yes; and he went there - I saw Whyman after that; I went to see him, most likely on the 7th day, as the goods would be condemned that day; I saw him in possession of the goods I had left him with - I have known the prisoner five years, he bore the character of an honest respectable man.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Marshalsea. I have known the prisoner since November last, when I saw him at the Horse Shoe and Magpie, in Fetter-lane - the landlord informed me, in his presence, that the prisoner had applied to him to recommend him to somebody to advise him how to act respecting a debt from a man named Brandrith, who had died in his house - he stated that the person had died in his house and left no will; that he owed him 79l., I think - I told him he had better apply to an attorney; he told me there was property in a box at the Grosvenor Arms, Chelsea, but he did not know what it was; in a short time Mr. Beetham, an attorney, who was in the habit of calling at the house, came in - I introduced him to him, and said he was as fit a person as I knew to attend to his business; he stated to Beetham, that Brandrith had died in his house in his debt, that he had left no will that he could find, and there was a trunk containing some property, of which he had the key, at the

            , Pimlico; Beetham said it was necessary a proctor should be engaged, and he went to Mr. Clarkson, at Doctors' Commons - either I or Beetham recommended him to apply to the landlord of the Grosvenor Arms to let him see the contents of the box to ascertain whether there was a will; he said if he obtained the amount of his debt he would pay both me and Beetham liberally - I believe that is all that passed then; I saw him next day - he told me the landlord of the public-house would not allow him to open the box; I had gone the day before with Beetham to the proctor, the prisoner was not there - I saw him several times every day for a fortnight nearly at the same public-house; the next circumstance I recollect, was going with Beetham and the prisoner down to Pimlico to examined the box, which was on the 8th of December, about a fortnight after I first saw him; Beetham applied to the landlord to let him see the box, and Beetham produced a will in the prisoner's presence - this is the will he produced (looking at it) - the landlord then delivered up the box to be examined; there were clothes, books, and some Bank Stock warrants found, but no will there; there was a quantity of letters and papers, but none of any importance - an inventory was taken of the different articles; I got a tape tied over the box, sealed it, and left it in possession of the landlord, taking away the inventory; a very short time afterwards I saw the prisoner, when he and his brother made an application to Beetham to give up the will; I heard the application made - he refused to give it up till his bill was paid; Beetham afterwards instructed me to go with him and the prisoner and his brother to fetch the trunk from Pimlico; we all three went with a man to carry it - the landlord delivered it to me and the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. At the public-house, he mentioned a box at Pimlico to be searched; did he say he thought a will would be found somewhere? A. Yes, he presumed it would be found in that box; he spoke as if he expected there was a will in existence, though it had not been found - no secret was made about it; it was known to us and to twenty other people - a man named Whyman was there on some occasions; the first time I saw him was after the will was produced; I saw him the day before or the day after the will was produced to the landlord - I did not go with Whyman to Doctors' Commons; I only went the first time with Beetham - I made an affidavit before the Lord Mayor; I saw Whyman once, twice, or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not stated by Whyman that the will had been made by him, and found by him? A. Not in my presence - I heard nothing about the will, only that it was produced; it was stated either by the prisoner or his brother that it was found in the ticken of a portmanteau or a trunk - I did not know at any time that the will had been written by Whyman; he was called the schoolmaster.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You say you saw the prisoner nearly every day, do you know whether he went out of town during that time? A. I think he went out of town twice during the time - he went out of town and was absent at least a fortnight; I think there had been a Iapse of a fortnight from his first application to Clarkson and his demanding the box, and during that time I did not see him; I did not see the will before it was produced to the land<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100055"/>lord - I think the prisoner had been in town about two days before it was produced to the landlord.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Can you tell whether the prisoner or his brother told the landlord where the will was found? A. It is impossible for me to say who said it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the expression that the will was found, or that he had found it? A. It was said in general conversation that it was found in the ticken of a trunk or portmanteau.</p>

            . I am an attorney. I was passing the Horse Shoe and Magpie, Fetter-lane, the latter end of last year; I think it was the beginning of November, and was introduced to the prisoner by Lee; they were standing in the street as I passed up - Lee said, "Mr. Beetham, these gentlemen want you to do some business for them;" I think there were two others; I am sure there was one -I was addressed by, I presume, the prisoner's brother; the prisoner was present; I believe he is rather deaf - the brother said a man named Brandrith had died in their village, and he believed he had made a will, but that will they had not in their possession; they suspected it might be in possession of a person at a public-house at the west end of the town, somewhere by Chelsea, where the deceased had a box; they said they had applied to search this box, but the landlord had refused them; they had previously said the deceased was indebted to the prisoner 60l., I think - he shewed me a letter which had been written to the deceased's sister, and returned "Not found;" I advised him to obtain letters of administration, as a creditor; that was agreed to - I immediately went down to my proctor, a Mr. Clarkson, and gave him instructions; I did not see the parties again for some time; they returned into the country, I believe; however, in about three weeks, (I think) the prisoner, with his brother and a third person, who I understood to be Whyman, came to my house, which was then in Grenville-street, Brunswick-square; they then produced to me a document, purporting to be a will; I think this (looking at the instrument) to be the same.</p>

            . I am a proctor of Doctor's Commons. I have seen the prisoner; he produced this will to me (looking at it); he was sworn on the 12th of January; I had seen him about a month before on the subject of the will - Beetham came in the first instance, and instructed me to enter a caveat - I afterwards understood Beetham had the will, and refused to give it up for about a month; the will was produced to me by the prisoner; I am not aware whether I or my clerk was present when he was sworn - the jurat is in my hand-writing; it was written on the 12th of January; the signature to it is Dr. Coote's - my office is in Doctors' Commons; probate was granted on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you recollect distinctly from whom you received the will, whether from the brother or Whyman? A. I believe the brother was present; but whether I received it from the prisoner or his brother I cannot tell; I believe the prisoner was present; I should say so from the jurat - the will was not in my hands till the jurat was written; Beetham was not present when I received it - I believe the brother and Whyman were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a clear memory, or are you sure the prisoner was present when you received it? A. I should have some difficulty in swearing that positively; I am sure I wrote the jurat, but who swore to it I do not know; I am not certain whether I went to Dr. Cootes, or my clerk- who took the oath I do not know; I do not recollect that I got him sworn.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The question is not whether he was the man before Dr. Coote, as you do not know whether you were present yourself; it is when that will was put into your hands (you say three people brought it to you;) was the prisoner present or not at the time the will was produced to you?

               <p>Q. Do you believe him to be the man? A. I have no recollection of him; I have not sufficient recollection to enable me to form a belief; I believe I saw somebody on the subject of the will, about the middle of December - I have no doubt of it; the prisoner might have been one of the persons I saw then - I believe he might have been; I believe he was among them.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Where did you acquire the information relative to the amount of the personal property? A. From one of the party in attendance; I do not recollect whether the prisoner was present at the time the information was given.</p>

New 4 per Cents., 115l. 16s. 9d. 3 1/2 per Cents.; the produce of the two sums was 367l. odd - I have seen him on different occasions at the Bank, no where else; he showed me a will - Michael Whyman was with him at the time; I believe the will produced to be the one he presented to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you make any mark on it, so as to know it again? A. No - he showed it to me about the middle of January; I told him he must take it to a proctor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it about the 15th of 16th of January? A. I dare say it might; I will not swear it was not later, nor do I swear this is the paper; I think it was about the middle of the month - the probate lay in the will-office three weeks before it was acted upon; I know that because I took it away from the will office myself - the document shown to me was paper, not parchment.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When are the 4 per cent. dividends due? A. On the 5th of January; I saw the prisoner about the stock the latter end of January; I went to the office myself to take the probate there - the prisoner gave it me to carry there.</p>
               <p>Q. You have stated this will was shown to you - under what circumstances was it produced? A. Suffolk, the prisoner, told me he had left the will with an attorney named Beetham; this was some time in December - I had told him nothing could be done without the will, and upon that it was produced to me at the Bank; I told him he must take it to a proctor; I made no mark on it, but the will produced appears to be the same - I read it over, and recollect the names of the witnesses; I believe it is the paper he produced to me.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You made no mark on it? A. No Whyman and another man, who I believe is the prisoner's brother, were with him - which of them produced it to me I cannot say; they were all present.</p>


               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. The prisoner gave you the direction about the stock, and you paid him the money? A. Yes; I am sure the prisoner gave me the direction about the stock.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did the prisoner first make application to you? A. In December; he asked for Mr. Brazier at first, and on inquiry I found Brazier was dead; there were two persons with him; the prisoner was the one who asked for Brazier - I told him he was dead; the prisoner then asked me if I would do some business for him, and said it was to sell some stock under a will - I found some difficulty in transferring the stock, as the names were differently spelt; I saw the prisoner several times before I could make the transfer; he was waiting in expectation of it every day - he mentioned in December about the will being at Beetham's; he said it was lodged there, and he found some difficulty in getting it away - I told him I must have it, or nothing could be done, and it was brought to me in January, by the prisoner; the other two were with him then - I cannot tell which of them produced it; this was at the Bank; I told him that very day that he must go to a proctor - I got the probate three or four days after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100057"/>that; the prisoner brought it to me - his brother was with him then, but not Whyman; I lodged it in the will office, and after that the transfers were made.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I was acquainted with Mr. Brandrith many years, having served together in the army; we were on the most friendly terms - he repeatedly told me and other persons that he intended to leave me all his property; when his death took place, knowing he had property, and not knowing whether he had made a will, I immediately wrote to his sister, hoping she might be able to give me some clue where the will might be found - I accidentally mentioned the circumstance to Whyman, among others, and he informed me he had made a will for him shortly before he died; Whyman afterwards produced the will to me, and I had every reason to believe it was the one Brandrith had made, and being ignorant of business, I left it to my brother and Whyman, to do what was necessary.</p>

             was in my service; he was about eleven years old. On the 24th of August, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I employed him to draw a truck with a small bed on it, from the Kent-road to Chelsea; I accompanied him - he was standing resting in the carriage road with his truck; I was on the pavement near him, and saw a cart coming at a very quick pace - before I had time to warn him, the cart struck against the truck; it had been a rainy night, but was clear then - I saw the cart about four yards from me; the driver must have seen him if he had used proper caution, I certainly think - I saw the cart strike the truck; the boy called out twice before it struck, but the cart did not slacken its pace till it struck the truck - the shaft must have struck it and knocked the boy down, and the wheel went over his body; the blow overset the truck, and threw the contents out - the boy screamed violently, and I went to him; the cart was stopped - there were three men in it; the driver got out, and gave himself up as soon as it was stopped - he was not sober, but quite in liquor; he was driving very quickly - the boy was taken to an apothecary's, and then to Westminster-hospital; he was very near the curb-stone when it happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he sitting on the truck? A. No, he was standing within the handle in his proper place - I saw the shaft of the cart strike the truck; I think the wheel struck the handle and broke it - there was some kind of metal in the cart, more than 3 cwt. it was said; a crowd got round the cart, and stopped it - I cannot say whether the man pulled the horse up himself; I rather think he did stop- I called several times to know who was the driver, and he gave himself up - I am sure he did not himself take the boy in his arms.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was he trotting or what? A. It was a kind of very quick trot; it was a dark night, but there was sufficient light from the shops to show the truck - the gas was not lighted.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner assist in carrying him to the doctor's? A. No; he came in a few minutes after he was carried in, and appeared to wish to speak to the boy - I do not think he appeared very anxious about it; it was rather a dark night, but not very- there were too many people for me to see whether the cart stopped itself, or was stopped; he gave himself up when the driver was asked for; I was too much frightened to notice the other two men - the man, who took the boy up, is not here; I was crossing when it happened, and was nearer to the cart than the truck - I was at the side of the cart, but I saw the truck long before I ran; I saw a piece of the flap of the truck fly off into the road.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At what pace was he going? A. Very quick; there was light enough for a person, who was ordinary cautious, to see the truck.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I was standing at my master's door, in Arabella-row, seven or eight doors from where this accident happened, looking towards the spot, and saw the horse going at a tidyish trot, of about six miles an hour - I do not think it was going too fast; the boy was resting about three feet from the curb- I heard him, or the lady, halloo out, and ran up before it happened; I saw the lad knocked down - I think it was the horse came against the truck, and broke the handle; it overturned and broke - all the things were thrown out; I saw the off-wheel go over the boy's loins - I could scarcely see the truck at the distance I was first at; three lamps, a little further off, were not lighted - there were no shops that gave any light of any consequence; if the driver had been ordinary cautious he might have avoided the truck if it was not for the hill, but it is a steepish hill, going down - the road is pretty broad; there were no other carriages - the lad was on the left side, and the driver coming on the same side, which was the near side; he appeared to me a little intoxicated - I should not know him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the truck three feet from the curb? A. When I got there the lad seemed to be trying to save the truck, and it must have been three feet from the curb - that part is shockingly lighted; the gas was not lit at all - it was a darkish night, and had been a wet evening; I know it is impossible to draw up in a moment, for I have a troublesome horse to deal with- it is a very awkward place to pull up at immediately; I saw the man throw the reins on the horse's head and get out - he followed the lad to the doctor's; he did not assist to carry him there - the cart would go quicker with a heavy load, at the brow of a hill, than in any other part; he had just got to the foot of the hill where he would have the least power over his horse - the cart was on its wrong side; I think two carriages might pass on the road; but the cart-horse turned out when it happened, and the truck was sent more into the middle of the road - there was room for another carriage to pass when it happened.</p>

            . I was in the cart with the prisoner when this happened; it was loaded with about 3 cwt. of cast-iron; another of my shopmates was in the cart, and a little boy belonging to the prisoner - the road is six or seven yards wide, as near as I can judge - there is room for two carriages to pass easily - I did not see the truck till the cart struck it; it was very dark; there was no lamps lighted at all - there were candles in the shop windows - the cart stopped directly it happened, as the boy screamed; I never heard any hallooing out till he was knocked down - the prisoner did not appear to me unable to take care of the cart - he had been drinking, and I dare say was not sober; I think he was in liquor, but able to conduct himself - he was on the right-hand side of the road, going towards Pimlico; the truck was on his right-hand side; that is, on the off-side - I saw nothing to prevent his going on the near side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are in the service of Mr. Cubit, the builder? A. Yes; the prisoner came to out place from Mr. Gabriel's, and one of my shopmates said he would give me a lift home in the cart - I was sitting on the same seat as him, on the near side; he was in the middle - I heard nobody cry out for us to get out of the way - he stopped, and got out directly the boy screamed; he was going at a smart trot, not a gallop - he was driving a lightish cart.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I take it for granted you made diligent inquiries in the neighbourhood to discover the thieves? A.

            . I am a watchman of St. Botolph. Mr. Wilson's premises are on my beat; I was on duty early on the morning of the 14th of July - I know the prisoner Chick, and saw him that morning, between half-past four and five o'clock, standing with his back towards Mr. Wilson's premises, and near it there is a gateway within one house, and he was near the gateway, as near as I can say fifty paces distance; I suppose he was within three or four yards of Wilson's premises; I did not see him do any thing, he was standing still when I first saw him, and at other times walking he walked towards me - when I saw him start for walking: he passed quite close to me - we passed each other; the gas was not alight, it was quite daylight, a bright morning between half-past four and five o'clock; I have not the least doubt he is the man I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him? A. I did not know him before the 14th of July - I never saw him before to my knowledge; I do not know Vaughan; I do my duty as well as I can - I looked after the empty house that night the same as the rest of the premises; I saw it was fast - I have no box - I have a seat within fifty paces of Mr. Wilson's; I go out of the street to the back and front of the premises on that side, and that is all I have to do; I do not know a person named Wear, and do not know of the empty house being taken - I did not see any body go in there that morning, nor ever said I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Am I to understand you swear deliberately that you never said before the Justice the person you saw with his back to the premises was Vaughan? A. I do not understand you; I never said I saw Vaughan, or that I believed it to be Vaughan, or that I would not swear it was Chick; he was in my sight five minutes from my first seeing him till he passed me - he went towards Crown-street and I towards Mr. Wilson's; he was standing still when I first saw him - there were other people passing and re-passing that morning, but not at that time to my knowledge; I do not recollect seeing any body from half-past four o'clock till five; I saw Chick, he was the only person on that side of the way - I had seen other persons pass in the night; I came on at three o'clock, and saw several people going to market.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you observe Chick particularly? A. Yes; because he observed me - he looked me full in the face as he passed, and of course I looked him full in the face; I have not the least doubt of him - I knew him as soon as I went into the office.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know who the empty house belonged to? A. No; Mr. Collins, the butcher, had the letting of it - I do not know that it had been let.</p>

            . I am single. On the 14th of July I lived with Mr. Grimsell, at No. 2, Sun-street; I got up about a quarter-past five o'clock that morning - Mr. Wilson's house is nearly opposite ours; I was opening the parlour shutters, and observed a man passing on Mr. Wilson's side of the way - the street is about thirty feet wide; I observed the person distinctly, and believe Chick to be the man - when I first opened the shutters he was passing Mr. Wilson's house; as he passed the next house to Mr. Wilson's some other man came out of the empty house; I have a recollection of that man's person, it was not the prisoner Elliott - Chick passed the empty house, and the other man followed him directly - they went towards Bishopsgate-street, one following close to the other; they did not appear to be talking; I saw them go not quite to the end of Sun-street towards Bishopsgate; I then lost sight of them - I afterwards saw the same persons again coming down in the same direction towards Wilson's house; I am quite sure they were the same two persons - I saw them go into the empty house, and while they were in there a cart drew up to the door of the empty house - I saw four large bundles put into the cart by the same two men, and they drove away directly; there was a man in the cart, he did not get out - the cart went towards Bishopsgate-street; I have no recollection of the driver's person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It has been said you have sworn to Chick? A. I have not sworn to him, I cannot, but I believe him to be the man as far as I know; I had never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100060"/>seen him before to my knowledge; I have seen Vaughan and Wear at Worship-street in custody - I saw one of them in Mr. Wilson's shop; I do not know where I saw the other first; I think not more than five minutes elapsed from the time I saw the man I suppose to be Chick, till the two men returned to the cart; the watchman was off his beat at the time - it was a fine bright morning; I had seen Vaughan and Wear bargaining for the house one evening, it was too dark to discern much of them; they were not charged with the felony in my presence - it was for removing the fixtures of the empty house that I saw them in custody; they were not removed till after the 14th, for they moved into the house after the robbery; I saw them bargaining for the house on the Friday before the robbery - they did not move in till after it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do I understand you distinctly to say Elliott was not the other man who came out of the empty house? A. He was not.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. In consequence of information I went to a house. No. 28, Vincent-street, Bethnal Green, on the 17th of July, with Garton and Attfield, between twelve and one o'clock in the day; I went into the parlour by breaking the door open, and found in that parlour Chick and his wife and a woman named Dobson - I knew Chick before, and am certain of him; on a table in the room I found two pieces of silk serge, which I produce - also on the left side of the room six pieces of different coloured silk, mostly for waistcoats; some were on the floor, and some on a yard measure - Garton found some pieces of ribbon and ferret - we made a further search; Attfield, in my presence, found in a cupboard two skeleton keys, and in the table drawer a quantity of small files, a centre-bit and screw-driver - he has them in his possession; the outer door was open - we did not ask leave to go in, but broke in, that we might enter without giving notice; Attfield asked Chick how he came by this property - he said he should tell somebody else about that, or words to that effect; we took them all in custody - Dobson was afterwards discharged; between six and seven o'clock the same evening we went to No. 26, Vincent-street, and found the lower room open - nobody was in it at the time; it is next door but one to Chick's - I know it was Elliott's house, for I saw Mrs. Elliott afterwards, and asked if that was her room, the parlour; she said it was - they were not there when I went in; Attfield found some silk there in a bonnet-box, and Vann, who was with us, found some cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Chick was asked how he came by the silk, and said he should tell somebody else? A. Yes; I have a full recollection of what passed - that is all the conversation I took notice of; I had known Dobson for three or four years, and often saw her before - I cannot swear how she gets her living.</p>
               <p>Q. When Attfield asked Chick how he came by the silk, did he not point out Dobson as the woman who had brought it in, and that within ten minutes of that time? A. No, he said nothing of the sort in my hearing, I swear; he could not have said it without my hearing it. I never paid Mrs. Dobson any money in my life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You went to Elliott's six hours after Chick's, from whose house you had taken property? A. Yes, in bundles; the street was full of people when we brought the property away; it was well known in the neighbourhood that the officers had taken property from a house two doors from Elliott's- no opposition was made to our searching Elliott's, for nobody was in the room; we searched thoroughly - there were three of us; I have heard Mrs. Elliott is a dressmaker - the silk was in different pieces, as if for dresses, and in the progress of making up - it was cut, and part of a body made; the first examination had been that day - it was over when we went to Elliott's; we had not got information about Elliott till after the examination - I believe Attfield left word for Mrs. Elliott to attend the office on the Saturday; there was no examination on Saturday - I saw Mrs. Elliott at the office on Saturday, but did not see her husband; whether a message was left for him to come I cannot say; Mrs. Elliott was not detained - the next examination was on the Wednesday following; Mrs. Elliott was told to attend, and she did so - I did not see her husband there till I saw him at the bar of the office; that was at the second examination.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On Friday, the 17th of July, in consequence of information, I went with Brown to No. 28, Vincent-street; Garton came immediately after - we burst open the door, and found Chick, his wife, and Dobson in the room; I found a mallet, a hummer, a pair of pincers, seven or eight files, a latch, two skeleton keys for an inner door(Mr. Wilson gave me the centre-bit); some silk and ribbon were found by Brown - we went to Elliott's between four and five o'clock that afternoon, and in a sort of hat or bonnet box in the back part of the parlour I found about sufficient silk to make two gowns, and Vann found some cloth at the bottom of the same box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where did you find the silk and ribbon at Chick's? A. About the room, in different parts; some on the table and some on a measure - I knew Dobson; they are weavers by trade, but what else she does I do not exactly know; she was brought to the office, and held to bail; Vaughan and Wear were at the office, but I know very little of them; I only knew of their having taken the house from hearsay- they were charged on suspicion of being concerned in this robbery, and examined twice; they were charged with taking away the fixtures of the empty house, I understand - I cannot say whether they were in possession of the empty house on the night of the robbery; after I had done searching, I said to Chick, "How came you in possession of this property?" Dobson was in the room; his answer was, "I decline giving any account till I go before a Magistrate;" he looked round when I asked how he became possessed of it, and said, "The piping dues are on," meaning somebody had been giving information, and they would get paid handsomely for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about Mrs. Dobson? A. I am not certain that he did - I never heard him state that she had brought the silk in a bundle a few minutes before I came in - he asked me if there was any reward; none had been offered to my knowledge; I know nothing of 10l. having been given to Mrs. Dobson - she lives in Cock-lane, Bethnal-green; all that neighbourhood is a common resort for thieves.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100061"/>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you happen to know Mrs. Elliott is a dress-maker? A. From what I have heard; I found the silk partly made up; I saw Mrs. Elliott in a neighbouring house some time after we had taken the property out of their room, she was crying; I had left a message for her to come to the office next day, and she did; she was desired to attend another examination, and did; at the last examination but one she was attending, and was ordered into custody; her husband was there on the 22nd, which was the last examination but one; he came voluntarily - I was sent to the public-house; I went and called Elliott. he came to me directly, and I took him into custody; I asked Mrs. Elliott how she became possessed of the property on the very night when I saw her crying; she was alone; I asked her how she came by the silk found in her room; she said Mrs. Chick had given it to her to make up into dresses, and I believe she has told that story ever since - I do not remember her husband saying he had been dining with his club on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever heard of piping dues before? A. Never; it was a new term I thought - he said it a little time after I asked how he came by the property; Mrs. Dobson was let go by the Magistrate; she attended again, and gave bail to appear at the Session if any indictment should be preferred.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was it Dobson that explained the meaning of piping dues to you? A. No, nor Chick.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. I went to Chick's house, and afterwards to Elliott's; I found this cloth; it is cut for two coats, two pairs of trousers, and two waistcoats; it is not cut out into any pattern, but it is a sufficient quantity for that - I found a quantity of mortar, or lime, on this piece of black cloth -Mrs. Elliott said she was a dress-maker, and had the silk given her to make up by Mrs. Chick; she was then asked who brought the cloth, and said, "Mrs. Chick;" she was asked at the office who brought the cloth, and said, "Mr. Chick;" she was then ordered to be detained.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You imagine them to be coat lengths by the quantity? A. That is all; they might make a woman's or child's pelisse - it is a very small part of the property; she said Mrs. Chick had brought the silk when I first saw her, and that she had brought the cloth also - about a week after she said Mr. Chick brought the cloth; I had seen Mr. Elliott at the office before he was in custody; I heard no account where he was on the night of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I have seen the property at the office; the whole of it is mine, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you noticed the property found at Elliott's? A. Yes; I should judge that to be worth about 5l. 10s.; the cloth was all in one piece when I lost it; it has been cut since; there was no lime or mortar on it when I left my house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was this property loose on shelves or drawers? A. The cloth was on shelves, and the silk in drawers, which were not locked; if the cloth had been taken through the hole it would be likely to get marks of lime or mortar.</p>
               <p>Richard Chick's Defence. When the officer entered my house I was handcuffed; they asked me who brought the property there - I said I should make no reply till I got before a Magistrate, but requested them to go and take Mrs. Dobson, and to go and search her premises - they took her, and searched her premises; Mrs. Dobson and one of the officers went into my back yard; a lodger, who is ill in the workhouse, overheard her say to the officers, "You have come too soon - you ought to have let me go out before you came in;" at the first examination the watchman stated that he could not swear to me positively - he had seen a tall thin man very much like me, but could not swear I was the man - at the final examination he came and swore I was the man. On Thursday night, about ten o'clock, on the 16th of July, I and my wife were going to Shoreditch to purchase something for supper - we passed Mrs. Dobson's house; she was at the door; she came after us, called us, and said to me, "You make yourself very strange;" I said, "Why, I know you are a neighbour, but I never had any conversation with you;" she said, "Well, the reason I called you was that I have some silk and cloth that I can let you have - I have enough to make your wife three dresses, and yourself a suit or two of clothes; they are my husband's - he buys and sells silk and cloth on commission, and he is a weaver;" I said I thanked her, and would consider of it, I would call in and let her know when I came back - I went into her house, and asked her to let me look at some patterns; she showed me several -I said I should like to have two yards and a half of drab kerseymere, two yards and a quarter of olive, and a yard and three quarters of black cloth, three quarters of a yard of brown cloth, and enough silk to make three gowns - I had eleven yards of fawn, twenty-two of brown, and a small piece of figured silk, and a piece of black to make my boy a waistcoat; she said if I would call in the morning I could have it - I went in the morning, and received from her the cloth produced and the silk found at Elliott's - they live next door but one to me; his wife was in the habit of making up dresses for mine for four years; I called, and told her Mrs. Dobson had sold me the silk, and she should have the making up of the dresses; in the morning I and my wife went and got the goods - I went out; my wife sent in for Mrs. Elliott, and gave her the silk to make up; I had asked Mrs. Elliott if she knew of a good tailor; she said she knew a gentleman who made clothes for a friend of hers - I said I would get her to show him to me, and when my wife said she had given her the silk, I took the cloth in, for Mrs. Elliott to show me where the tailor lived; there was a female in her house; I laid it down in the bundle handkerchief now produced, and said I would come in presently - I went out, and was in my house about half an hour, when in came Dobson; she said, "Mr. Chick, have you put out the silk and cloth to make;" I said I had - she said, "I know a person who can make it up good and cheap for you;" I said I had put it out - she said, "I have a quantity of silk and ribbons which I wish to measure - it is going to a silk-mercer and draper's on Ludgate-hill, who I have served for some years, and having converted my house into a brothel, I have so many people coming in and out, I don't like to measure it there;" I said by all means she could bring it to my house to measure, as she had been so kind as to let me pay for these goods at 2s. a week - she went away, came back in five minutes, and said she must bring some brown paper in - she had forgotten the yard, which she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100062"/>fetched (that should be produced, for I believe it has her name on it;) after she went out for the paper, in about five minutes, a little girl, who I believe to be her daughter, came in with a book yard, and said her mother would be there directly; Mrs. Dobson was a long time, I thought it strange; in the course of three quarters of an hour she came into my house, confused, with the paper - I had taken hold of some of her silk after the yard was left, and measured some of it; I said I dare say it was right - she said she dare say it was; she was so confused she could neither look at me nor my wife, but I had no idea of the villany and trepan-game she was going on with; she asked if we had a bottle to get some gin - I said I had not: she asked for a pen and ink; I said I could borrow some - a pen and ink, and a bottle was brought, and in five or ten minutes in came the officers; she began to abuse them scandalously. calling them Mr. Bounce, and every thing she could think of; when they asked who brought the property, I said I should decline giving an answer till before the Magistrate - I requested them to take her and search her premises; she went out with the officers - whether they searched her premises I cannot say; I and my wife were taken before the Magistrate - the officers stated they brought me and my wife on suspicion of a robbery recently committed in the City; and he said he found part of the property on as - the Magistrate said he should remand us; I said, "Your Worship, what is the reason Mrs. Dobson is not brought forward, she is the woman who brought the property to my place;" I think it was Garton said she was in custody - they went out and brought her in; she said, "What do you want with me?" I said, "You base hussey, you have brought goods to my house, knowing them to have been stolen;" a little whispering went on between the officer and Magistrate, and Mrs. Dobson was let go - at the final examination she was bailed to answer any indictment, but she is not produced here; as to the watchman, every man, on the examination, was ordered to put their hats on - I being placed individually at the bar, and pointed out to him; if I had been with other men I should not have been pointed out - he was asked if he had seen the man since; he said No; he was shewn me, and said he believed me to be the man, but would not swear it; but at the last examination said he had no doubt I was the man - I have not the least doubt the officer persuaded him to say I was the man; Vaughan and Wear were produced at the examination, and I believe the servant swore to Vaughan being the man. - My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, You now behold before you an unfortunate individual, brought to the tribunal of justice for an offence of which he is innocent: I now avow myself innocent, but it is for you to decide and act impartially; this trial is a base attempt on my life. and supported by that guilty individual, Mrs. Dobson: I hope you will consider the awful situation I stand in, should you find me guilty of this offence, of which I am as innocent as a baby unborn: I have a wife and large family which I support by honest industry; I leave myself to your merciful consideration, and should your verdict prove against me, it will cause distress to a large family, and myself an ignominious death. I say and avow again, that the lamb that never leaped the grass, was never more innocent than I am.</p>

            's Defence. On the 17th of July I was at work by half past five o'clock in the morning till ten at night; I came home, and finding my wife with a deal of property, I asked what was the cause of it; she said she had taken in work for Chick: I said, "My dear, I hope you have spoken the truth, and the truth will never be blamed;" she said she had, and she was to appear on Monday; she went up on Saturday; I went up to the office; she was let go till Wednesday; I went there on Wednesday, and took hail there for her appearance; I had not been there long before an officer came into the adjoining public-house, and called Elliott; I went to him, and was taken, and committed till the following Wednesday; I knew nothing of the property being brought, or any thing of the kind; on the Monday before the robbery I was dining with my brother tradesmen at a feast - I came home and went to bed.</p>

               <p>Mary Elliott's Defence. On Monday we were at White Conduit-house till half-past one o'clock in the morning, when the person of the house let us in, and fastened the house, and before we were up she came into our room - we know nothing of the robbery; the silk was given me by Mrs. Chick, and the cloth afterwards by Mr. Chick; the officer came to my house between seven and eight o'clock - I was not at home; they saw me afterwards, and said I was to be at the office in the morning - I went; Brown came and told me I should not be wanted till Monday, when I went, and was detained; my husband was there all the afternoon - Vann said he dare say I should be bailed on Wednesday, and when he came on Wednesday with bail they detained him; he was not at home from five o'clock in the morning till eleven at night, when the property had been taken from my place.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. The value of all the property found is about 36l.</p>

            . I am married - my husband is a wheelwright; I lodge in the same house as Elliott. On the 13th of July he went out between eleven and twelve o'clock, and by his desire his wife was to go in the afternoon, and she did - I had the care of their family; I let them in in the morning at nearly three o'clock - they came home together; Mr. Elliott was very much intoxicated indeed, particularly so - we had a difficulty to get him to bed; he fell on his bed at last - I fastened the street door, and took the key up to my room to prevent his getting up to go out; I saw him in bed at eight o'clock in the morning, when I went up for a light - Mrs. Elliott is a dress-maker.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you a clock in the house? A. No - I know the hour by the watchman going by, and I asked him; I do not lock the door and take the key up every night, but I did it particularly that night, as he seemed anxious to go out again for drink, and it being late we wished to keep him in - it was the key of the front door; I had also the key of the back door - I am certain I knocked at his door for a light in the morning, and Mrs. Elliott said, "Walk in;" they do not burn a light, but Mrs. Elliott was up, getting breakfast, and had a fire - she opened the door, gave me a light, and I saw him in bed; the room the officer found the property in was their's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you any private mark on it? A. No; but I weighed them out and in; I could tell my own goods if they were down in Yorkshire - I had perhaps five or six tons of them - there was some rubbish in the shop; I saw one pig's head there - I never saw the prisoner before; I have no doubt but this bill of parcel is mine (looking at it), and no doubt he bought these goods and paid for them - he might have come when I was out; this bill is dated October, 1828 - it is the writing of one of my people in Rose-street, where I have another warehouse; I do not know that Jacksons are mother and son - Parsons came alone for the things.</p>

On the 24th of July Parsons came to his shop, and in consequence of my master's directions I went with my brother and Parsons - we took the bacon and ham to a house in Bainbridge-street; Parsons assisted in laying it on a bench - Parsons then called for a light; Thomas Jackson brought one - Mr. Brown had told us, in his hearing, not to leave the goods without the money; when we had put down the goods, Parsons told us to come with him - when we got outside the door he said he wanted some cheese, and he would go to Mr. Brown's for one; when we got part of the way he said it was too late to go that night, if one of us would return he would pay - I returned with him, and my brother followed behind; when we got back to Bainbridge-street, Parsons told me to go into the room where we had delivered the bacon and hams, and he would bring me the money - the bacon and hams were not there then; I waited three or four minutes, and then a woman, not this prisoner, came and asked if I was waiting for Mr. Parsons - I said Yes; she said I need not wait, he was gone down to pay my master- I said I should wait three or four minutes to see if he came back; she then went out of the room - I went to the door and told my brother, and sent him for Mr. Brown, who came shortly and gave me charge of the boy Jackson, whom he brought into the room to me - I had only seen him at the time he brought the light.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he acting as a servant? A. He brought the light; I saw Margaret Jackson standing in the house when I was going to take the bacon to the watch-house - Parsons did not say that he had only 4l. 10s. in the house, but he would go and get the difference; I did not notice whether there was any counter or any articles in the shop.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Bloomsbury. I know the house in Bainbridge-street; this time twelve months Mr. Jackson lived there, the husband of this woman, and the father of this boy - Parsons married Jackson's daughter, and came to live there - Jackson and his wife were indicted by the parish and went to prison; I heard the rattle spring, went, and met Mr. Brown, who told me what he wanted and said he should search the house - I heard him ask this boy where the bacon was; he said he knew nothing about it, that it was not in the house - I heard Mr. Brown ask this woman, and she said the same; she reached him the keys, and said he might search every room in the house - I told him to come in with me, I knew where it was if it was in the house, and I showed him the trap door in the back parlour - I lent Mr. Brown my light, then went down, and found the bacon and hams under my feet; the lad came down - I went to another part of the cellar and found Parsons there doing nothing; I asked him whether he stole the bacon - he said he bought the bacon, and did not care any thing about Mr. Brown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You asked him whether he stole it, and he said he bought it? A. Yes; I asked him if he paid for it; he said he had not - I did not see this woman in prison; I was not at the marriage of Parsons and Jackson's daughter - I was watchman of that beat.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you known Parsons and Jackson's daughter to live together as husband and wife? A. Yes; Jackson was tried for keeping five or six bad houses, and that house was one - she had six months' imprisonment: Parsons came there while they were in prison.</p>
               <p>MR. BROWN re-examined. Q. Can you form any idea of the value of the articles in the shop? A. I suppose there were not more than 2l. worth of goods - I saw some small bits of bacon and some other little things.</p>

             re-examined. Q. What time elapsed between Mr. Parsons' desiring you to go with him, and he would pay Mr. Brown, and your coming back and finding the bacon gone from the bench? A. I suppose about twenty minutes; we walked down a few streets, and stopped talking I suppose for five minutes.</p>
               <p>Parsons' Defence, I told him to wait five minutes while I went to borrow 10s.; I went to a neighbour in the same line in the next street to borrow 10s. - when I came back he was gone: I said, "Is he gone?" this woman said, "Yes, he did not wait half a moment;" I said, "I suppose he won't come back to-night?" and directly Mr. Brown, with a lot of watchmen, came and broke open our doors.</p>

            . I live in Cock-alley, Norton Falgate, and know Monksfield by her coming down that alley to see Mullins. On the 8th of August I was in Camberwell-road, and saw the two prisoners together, a good way from Mr. Dutton's shop - they asked me where I was going; I said I was going home - Monksfield said she was going to the shop to get some shoes to bind; Mullins and I waited - Monksfield went to the shop and brought out six pairs of shoes, and gave them to us to mind, on the step of a door; she said she had to go back in half an hour - that was some distance from the shop; I did not see the shop - she then brought out some more, and put them altogether in her lap; and as we were coming over London-bridge, Monksfield said, "Mullins, how you tremble, if there is any thing amiss I will take it all on myself" - we went home and counted the shoes on the bed; there were seventeen pairs, which she said she had from Mr. Dutton's to bind - they were bound, and I said they did not want binding; she said they did - we then went out with them, and she pawned some; she said she wanted 1l. 12s. to get a young man out of prison - she pawned one pair at Mr. Cotton's, and one pair further on, and then we stopped at the corner of Old-street, and she said she pawned some, but I do not know how many - I pawned one pair at the corner of Long-alley, and gave the money to Mullins; I went to pawn another pair in Aldersgate-street, and there I was stopped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. How long have you known Monksfield? A. About two years - we were at a considerable distance from the shop; I did not see it - we watched her as far as we could see; as we were coming past the shop, she said that was Mr. Dutton's - I thought it must be wrong when I saw the shoes were bound; it was the first time I had been with her - Monksfield was at the door when I was taken; I did not partake of the produce - Monksfield bought a penny pie, and gave us some of it; I met them casually on the road.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was Monksfield? A. Behind a bedstead - she went into hysterics; I put her into a chair, and told her not to be frightened, nobody would hurt her - Birch was below stairs when I took her; she said she was pregnant.</p>

            . I was in Crown-street, about half-past eight o'clock, and saw the prisoner and another; I followed them - they separated, and joined company again; I then took the prisoner, and asked what he had got; he said what was that to me; I took this work-box from under his arm - he said he had it to take home for his sister; I took him to the watch-house; he then said he bought it of a young man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you tell him you would give him a lift for being saucy? A. No; he was rather bounceable; he said, I am a respectable man, and will let you know it;" I had seen him about four months ago.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. A young man came up, and asked the way to the Seven-dials; the officer then came up, and asked what I had got - I said what was it to him; he said he was an officer - I said, "It is a workbox I bought of a young man for my sister;" he then took me: I was in London five month's ago, but have been in the country since.</p>

            . I am an inspector of St. Luke's watch. On the 20th of August, before twelve o'clock at night, the prisoners passed me in Windmill-street- Row had something under his jacket and Sanders had a jail dress on; I followed them - they walked quickly on to Finsbury-square, and then Sauders ran away: I took Row, and asked what he had got - he said a rabbit which he had found in Hoxton; I asked where he lived - he said he had no home, but slept in Fleet-market - next morning he told me he had found it in Tabernacle-square; I found Sanders on the 28th, about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it because Sanders had a jail dress on that you suspected him? A. No, I knew him before - Row could not run away, because I collared him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was he drunk? A. He was a little intoxicated, but knew what he was about; he had told my master, the night before, that if he did not give him money he would take a pair of shoes, and he told him the next day that he would take another pair if he did not give him money - he worked for my master.</p>

On the 27th of July, at five o'clock in the morning, I was in bed; my lodger caught the prisoner in the back kitchen - he called me up, and I found the prisoner in the back kitchen; he was quite a stranger to me - he got into the house by taking off four tiles out of the back kitchen; he got through the tiles - no other part whatever had been removed; he came down into the yard from his father's house, who lives two doors below- the tiles were all secure when I went to bed; there was a rabbit fastened up in the hutch, and I found it outside, on the tiles on the roof of the kitchen, quite frightened apparently - he would not move.</p>

             re-examined. I have no lodger besides Bruce; I am always the last in bed; I went into the back kitchen that night with a candle - it is a lean-to, having an internal communication into the dwelling; no doors were opened so that the prisoner could have got into the house - there is no area; he got through the tiles, where they are about six feet high, and then dropped down into the wash-house - there was no other place open; I cannot say how he knew that I had a rabbit, for I never saw him in my house before; there was very trifling property in the wash-house - there was more in the house.</p>

            . I am the officer who attended the last witness - I heard the name of Askam mentioned at the Police-office; the prisoner gave me a direction where to find him - I saw Askam at the Mail Coach, in Sherborne-lane, which was the place where the prisoner told me to find him; he told me that he was the man that he received the bill of - Askam promised to attend at Queen-square.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not also say that if this bill was a forgery he himself had been duped? A. He did; I went into his house at No.5, near Lambeth-walk - Mr. Neil's young man went in first and spoke to him, and then he came out; I desired Askam to attend at the office, and give an account of the transaction - I told him what time to attend in the evening; I did not endeavour to find him afterwards, and have never seen him since.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The prisoner wished Askam to come; I did not tell Askam at the time that the prisoner said he was duped by others.</p>

I have been in the habit of accommodating a few of my friends with my acceptances; I do not think I have accommodated twenty persons with my acceptances, but I will not swear that I have not; I was examined about a month ago at the Queen-square Police-office - I do not recollect stating there that I had never given any acceptance as an accommodation; I recollect afterwards swearing that I had given one within six weeks of that time, to a person of the name of Marcus, who is a general-dealer, I believe, in some sort of things, and lives at No. 6, Red Lion-court, Fleet-street; I stated at Queen-square Police-office, that I did not know where in Fleet-street Marcus lived - I forgot then, it slipped my memory; the amount of that bill was 19l. some odd shillings; I do not recollect that I stated to the Magistrate that I did not know the amount of the bill, or where it was made payable: I have not seen Marcus since, and do not know where I could find him; I know where he lives if I should be fixed with the payment of that bill; I never lent my name to Mr. Marcus as an accommodation but that once - I have been fixed with the payment of these bills in every instance in my former accommodations; I do not remember whether I have ever been reimbursed - I have had no money transactions with any persons - I never got from Mr. Marcus 10l. on account of a bill of exchange, purported to be accepted by my brother; my brother gave me a 100l. bill which he accepted in my favour, I think about two or three months ago; I heard of Mr. Marcus then for the first time, and that he was in the habit of discounting bills; I went to him, and gave him the bill to get discounted for me - he kept it for near ten days, pretending he could not get it discounted; I was kept in London waiting for the bill ten days; my brother was a little uneasy about it - he came up and saw Mr. Marcus, and demanded the bill back, which Marcus gave him; then Mr. Marcus came to Cowley, and made out his bill for 8l. for expences, and desired to get the bill discounted; he said he wanted me to pay him the 8l., then he said if I could accommodate him with a 19l. bill he could pay it away for some stoves that he wanted to put into his house, and when the bill became due he was to find his part and I mine; this was the acceptance of the same brother, who is represented to be a person of fortune; it was not an accommodation to me; when my father died he left some property in my hands, and this was a part of it; Marcus gave up the bill to my brother, the acceptor; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100079"/>have had in my hands a bill of exchange for 90l., purported to be accepted by my brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take a bill of exchange out of the hands of Keating and Co. to avoid a prosecution? A. I refuse to answer; I never in my life accepted bills of exchange in blank, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the accommodation bills you accepted used before you became a bankrupt? A. Before; I do not believe any of them were proved under my commission - part of them were in existence before the commission; I cannot say how many I have excepted since the commission - it is not ten, certainly; I never put my name on a blank piece of paper for the last two years, certainly - when I speak of my brother, I always mean Thomas, the brick-maker.</p>

Yes, five years ago; he owes me about 2000l. - I am one of his assignees; I have known very little of him since, for he was shy of me - I was going to render him once or twice; the amount of debts under the commission is nearly 4000l.</p>

In the night of the21st of April, or the morning of the 22nd, about two o'clock; I was awoke by my eldest daughter, and in consequence of what she said, I went into her room, and discovered that almost every article of box or trunk had been rummaged - I do not mean that all the contents were gone, but some were gone; they had been well examined - the boxes were not broken open: a watch, which hung at my daughter's bed-head, had also been removed - I was the last person up the night before, and went to bed about eleven o'clock; I examined every part of the house at that time, and saw it was perfectly secure, the doors, windows, and every thing; in the morning I found a pannel moved from the back-door of the house, leading to the garden, by means of a centre-bit - it appeared they had got in through the aperture, which was quite large enough to admit a body; the door was wide open - they had also unbolted the front door, and unlocked it; that had evidently been opened from within, and I suppose, with a view to get out that way - I made an alarm in front of the house on my daughter giving the alarm; a watchman appeared, and came over the yard to the back door - I then went down, and observed things as I have stated; I, the watchman, and aninspector of the watch of an adjoining parish, examined the premises behind - we found a small crow-bar in the kitchen, a stick by the back-door at which they entered, and a hat and a round for cap in the timber-yard at the side of the premises; I had a watch-dog in the yard - I believe it was partly a bull-dog; it was perfectly well over night, about eight or nine o'clock, when I saw him, and in the morning he appeared in extreme agony - his hind-quarters seemed in great weakness, and about six o'clock that morning he died; I thought I observed a swelling about his neck - he was skinned after death, but I did not see the carcase; I prosecuted a man, named King, for this felony. Having found the cap, stick, and hat on the premises, I made application at Lambeth-street next morning; Shelswell accompanied me to where the hat and cap were - I shewed them to him; he has had them ever since - in consequence of my application to the Police, the prisoner was apprehended about the 16th of May last; he was examined and remanded, probably about seven times, and was not detained on this charge.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, in consequence of some disclosures, did you employ the Police again? A. I went to Lambeth-street in consequence of information, and got a search warrant - I went with the officers to execute it; we called on the prisoner's wife on Fish-street-hill, where she worked - we took her from there to her lodgings, in Prince's-place, Walworth-common, Surrey; we were introduced to the sleeping-room of the wife, made search, and there we found a pair of bracelet-snaps in a small box - I supposed them to belong to my daughter, and in consequence of what she said, I returned to the premises, and found a pair of gold ear-rings, and brought them away in consequence of a description from her - Shelswell has got them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have said the prisoner was in custody on another charge - do you happen to know he has been acquitted on that charge? A. Yes - I think it was on the 5th of August that I searched the premises at Walworth; I have ascertained that the prisoner and his wife have been some time separated - I found the wife living in Prince's-place; I understand the prisoner was not living there - he was not apprehended there, certainly; I found nothing but the bracelet-snaps and earrings, that I claimed - they are not of much value, and a very small portion of the property stolen; in the first instance, the bracelet-snaps were said to belong to the prisoner's wife's sister - his wife's sister said so; the same person has claimed the ear-rings - I did not see that my dog bled at all; I suppose he had been beaten to death, because there appeared to be a swelling on the neck - it might be half an inch larger than the night before.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What was the value of the property you lost that night? A. I suppose 20l. or less would replace the whole that was taken away - I first saw the prisoner in custody in the middle of May; he was in custody from that time till the Croydon Assizes - his wife was at large when I saw her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you hear any noise in the night? A. I heard footsteps when I left my room to go to my daughter's, when she gave the alarm about two o'clock - they were not my daughter's footsteps; they were down stairs by the back-door of the house, and could not be the footsteps of any of my family - I have a wife and seven children; I did not hear the dog cry at all - my daughter did not come into my room; she gave the alarm by knocking at the door - I was asleep when she gave the alarm.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty on the night of the 21st of April, near Mr. Newton's house - in the course of the evening I saw some very suspicious looking people, and directed my attention to the people passing and repassing, and among them was James Brown, who was convicted last Session; and I observed the prisoner at the bar - I saw them together; they were passing between eleven and twelve o'clock - about half past eleven they were passing by Mr. Stevens' oil-shop, about twenty-five yards from Mr. Newton's.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner - speak advisedly, and tell me whether he is the man? A. I know him perfectly well -I have not the least doubt of his person; he had, to the best of my recollection, a round hairy cap on, and a stick in his hand - I did not notice his dress further; I had seen him about my beat before, and knew his person before -I was relieved about a quarter to one o'clock; Mallett succeeded me - I gave him notice to be vigilant and attentive, having some suspicion on my mind respecting those two men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. One man has been already executed for this robbery? A. He has; I recollect giving evidence on the former trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you state on that former examination, that you saw two men, one of whom you knew, and the other you did not know? A. No, I did not say exactly that -I said I saw two men, and the prisoner 
               <persName id="t18290910-169-person1602">Brown</persName>
             I knew well; I do not recollect your asking if I had as good a knowledge of the other as I had of Brown - I will swear I did not say I did not know the other; I went before the Magistrate in May, and stated that I knew them both - I stated what I have stated here; the prisoner was not discharged - he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100081"/>manded; I believe he was not at that time in custody for another offence-I believe no bill was preferred against him for this offence till now; there was a Session here in June and July-no bill was preferred against him at those Sessions, that I know of; I expect I was not more than ten yards from the two persons I saw - I never swore I was not more than one hundred yards; I believe I did state, on the last trial, that I knew one of them better than the other-I recollect I did say so; and that the prisoner I knew so well was Brown.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Brown tried here at the Session next after you had been before the Justice? A. I believe he was-I believe there has been a session between that and the present; I have not a doubt of the prisoner being the man I saw that night-one was about a head taller than the other; the prisoner was the tallest-I always described him so: the tall man had the cap and stick.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said at the trial here last Session, that you knew one better than the other? A. I had seen one oftener than the other; the expression I made use of might be that I knew one better than the other - I have no doubt of the prisoner, but I had known the other longer; I recollect the prisoner about the neighbourhood for three or four months; I considered that he did not live faroff-I did not know his name, but knew his person for three or four months before the robbery; I never spoke to either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to notice him so as to know him again? A. I had frequently seen him as I have desribed, with a cap and stick, the same sort of hair cap; I never heard him speak, to my knowledge - I never knew his business, or where he lived, but considered he lived across the Commercial-road, by seeing him go srequently that way.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When you appeared at the several examinations, and Brown was committed, was he committed alone? A. He was; the prisoner was not committed with him.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Mile-end, and succeeded Andrews on his beat at one o'clock on this night - he said something to me about some men; about two o'clock Mr. Newton called out of window for assistance-I went to the house, and saw a person making his escape over the pales in front of Newton's premises; he saw me, retreated back, and made his escape at the back of the premises - I did not see him escape; I was near him when he got over the pales in front-I did not see more than one man on the premises; I saw two men coming from the premises, by the gas-lights at the Bedford Arms, which are at the back of the premises-I observed as they ran by the light, that one had a hat on, and one was a head taller than the other; the one who had not hat on was the tallest-I cannot positively say whether the other had a cap, but I believe he had neither hat nor cap on; I am positive he had no hat-I could not see them so distinctly as to swear to them, other wise than by their size; Andrews had mentioned to me about some men he wished me to have an eye upon, and the two men agreed in size with his description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you venture to swear that you stated on the former trial, that the man had no hat on? A. I said I could swear the short one had a hat on; I think I said the other had no hat on, nor cap - I will swear I stated so; I said the bind one had a hat on - the short one was the hind one; the other had passed the gas-light- I think I stated the other had passed the gas-light before I could discern him, but I stated he had no hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state he had passed the gas-light, and you could not see what he had on? A. I do not recollect stating any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you did not? A. I believe I did - well, I did; I could not see what he had on, by the gaslight - I could not see what he had on.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, what do you mean by swearing that he had not a hat? A. That is the best statement I can give - I said I could not see what he had on; I saw him after he had passed the gas-light, and then I am positive he had no hat on - I pursued him after he passed the gas-light; I had not been pursuing him two minutes when the short one passed the gas-light. I stated on the last trial that I had a great coat on, and the man kept gaining ground on me; I have not said now that I was nearer to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said you saw him nearer after he passed the gas-light than before, and he had no hat on then? A. Well, I do not know but I might be nearer; they did gain ground - I believe I said on the last trial that he had no hat on; I will swear I did: I believe I did not state that I could not tell what he had - I said he certainly passed the gas-light before the other, and I could see the other clearer than the first, but to the best of my recollection I said he had no hat - I did state so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you perfectly certain that you swore he had no hat? A. I really forget now; I stated on the former trial that I saw he had no hat on - I am quite positive of that, but the other one I saw clearer than him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. On the former trial Brown was the only person tried? A. Yes; very few questions were put to me respecting the tall one.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Were you not asked by the counsel for the prosecution on the former occasion, whether you could or not say what the other man had on? A. I think I stated I could not see him so perfect as the other - I was not asked whether he had a hat or not; I believe I was not asked whether I could see what he had on.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to state positively that you said on the former occasion that the other had no hat on? A. I think I did not state no such thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are we to understand by that - you are asked whether you recollect the tall man? A. I believe the question was never put to me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by MR. CLARKSON. I certainly stated I could not see him so clear as the other, but I think I said in my first statement, that he had no hat on, if I have a recollection - I believe I did not state on the former occasion that I could not see what the other had on; I said he had no hat on, but that Brown had a hat - I do not recollect stating that I did not know what he had on; I think I stated he had no hat - I did not state that I could not see what he had on</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Brown alone was on trial then? A. Yes; the Judge asked the questions on that trial; Brown's counsel did not cross-examine me about the manner the tall man was dressed - I believe he asked how far I was off, and whether I was in a box; he asked very few questions - I do not recollect his asking me about the tall man at all.</p>

On the 22d of April, about ten minutes past two o'clock in the morning, I went to Mr. Newton's premises; before I reached the back door, I stumbled over some articles of wearing-apparel; I did not see any person on the premises - I found the pannel of the door taken out by a centre-bit; a person pointed out where he had seen a man getting over the front, and then retreating back; I then traced footsteps over four or five garden-walls towards Bedford-street - I think they were the steps of two persons - I stumbled over some wearing-apparel, which Newton has; I found a hat and a cap stuffed in it, and also a walking-stick and small crow-bar; I brought the crow-bar here at the last trial - the cap was a round hairy one - (Shelswell here produced the cup and stick.)</p>

            . I belong to Lambeth-street. This stick and cap were brought to me by Shelswell; after seeing them I went to No. 43, Rose-lane, Spitalfields, and apprehended the prisoner, suspecting he was the person, having seen him wear a cap similar to that, and carry a stick like that frequently - he lodged there; I knew that before - he was coming down stairs; we desired him to go up again, and when we got into the room I told him I wanted him for a robbery; he said, "What robbery?" I told him for a robbery down the road, meaning the Commercial-road: he said if any one wanted him, they might come there (to his lodgings) to see him; I told him that was not the way I did business, he must go to the office - he then went to the fire-place, took up a poker, made use of many oaths, and said he would not go; that I only wanted him to give him trouble; I told him he had better put the poker down - if he did not, we should certainly shoot him; Shelswell had a pistol, and pulled it out; he then sat down, and afterwards said he would go quietly; I searched the room, and found a crow-bar, dark-lantern, matches, phosphorus-box, and skeleton-key - I took him to the office; he underwent several examinations, and was not committed on that charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When was this? A. On the 16th of May; I knew he had lodged in Rose-lane two days before, and have ascertained since that he had been there three weeks - I have since ascertained that he was living separate from his wife.</p>

            . I live in Prince's-lane, Walworth-common; I am the prisoner's wife's sister. The search was made at my house in August; she had lived in that house ever since the latter end of October - I have not seen her husband with her since October last, I am positive; I do not know Sarah Stevens, nor Samuel Barwick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have they, to your knowledge, since October lived separate? A. Yes; these bracelet-snaps were found at my house in possession of the prisoner's wife; I know them - I do not know whose property they are; I know nothing of them; I had a pair of ear-rings like these; if these are not them, they are exactly the same pattern (looking at them); they were my husband's mother's, and one was broken in her ear when she was dying, twenty-five years ago last June; one of these are broken - to the best of my belief they are the same.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had they been in your possession since your mother died? A. They have never been out of my possession - the box was mine; my sister had nothing there; she had free access to my place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively these are your mother's ear-rings? A. No, because there are so many nlike.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say the things were in your box; did she keep any thing in your box? A. Yes, she kept articles of her own in it; the box is in my possession now.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has any box been burnt? A. Oh, my sister said she burnt a box, but I never saw it - the box is not here.</p>

            . I live with my father. On the night of the 21st of April I heard a noise in the house, and alarmed my father about half-past one o'clock; my room was plundered - I lost a watch from my bed, and a box containing some trinkets (looking at the bracelet snaps) - I think these are mine; I have a very strong opinion of it; I had such a pair like them in all particulars, but no particular mark on them; I had a pair of ear-rings, which I described to my father and the officer when they brought the snaps - these are them I am positive (looking at them) - I have not the least doubt about them; I have bad them eight or ten years - they were given to me by my aunt Drysdale; I broke one after they were given to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You do not speak positively to the snaps, but think they are yours? A. Yes; I am positive of the ear-rings by the colour, and the manner in which they are broken; I believe them to be a common pattern.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you only know them by the break? A. I know them by the look and appearance - they are the same colour, make, and shape altogether; and are set the same as what I lost; I should not have the least hesitation in saying they were what I lost if I had seen them any where; I should not have known them so well if I had not broken them.</p>

            . I am Miss Newton's aunt. I gave her a pair of ear-rings; I had had them between seven and eight years when I gave them to her, which was ten years ago - these produced are the same I am quite sure; I should know them as well if they were whole as broken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What enables you to speak positively to them? A. Because I had them so many years before I gave them to her; they are not a very common pattern - I never saw any like them; I bought them of Mr. Coffee, Commercial road, opposite Bermondsey-street; I know them by the shape of the stone and the colour of the stone; they are a particular dark cornelian; I may not have seen them for a year or a year and a half till they were before the Magistrate; they were broken when I saw them last-I knew them by nothing but the darkness of the cornelian. and the shape; I was before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see them there? A. Yes, and had no doubt about them; there is now a part of the broken piece left on the joint, but I had not noticed that.</p>

My Lord and Gentleman of the Jury, - I beg leave to state that I have been unfortunately tried capitally three times within the short space of three weeks, and am the victim of a foul conspiracy of the officers of Lambeth-street; I do not know why; they have declared, since I have been in custody, that they would hang me if there was a possibility to do it; there must be something more than the ends of justice attached to that - I have no more to say, but trust entirely to your superior judgment; as to the officers speaking to my identity, if they had given such evidence at the office I should have been committed for trial with the unfortunate Brown, and they had it all fresh in their memory then.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect when he came home wet one day, telling you he was going out to receive this 1l. 7s.? A. No - I cannot recollect his going out when he complained of being wet; I will swear he did not bring me home this 27s., place it on the desk, and desire me to enter it in the rough book. Three waistcoat-pieces which were found among his clothes have been kept back, considering them to have been stolen; they are at home, not exactly in my possession - I told the officer I meant to detain them, considering them Mr. Milner's; Mr. Milner has discharged an old servant since I have been there.</p>

            , of Holborn-hill; he was indebted to Mr. Milner 3l. 16s. 6d. - the prisoner produced a bill to me, and I saw him write a receipt for it, which I produce; he wrote it before me, up in the counting-house, and took it down with an order, which I wrote on the back, for Thompson to pay it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He was quite a stranger to you? A. Yes; I know him, because while he was looking down to write the receipt, he had rather a particular head of hair, which struck me he must be a man of colour, and I looked at his face, to see if he was; I did not tell the Magistrate I knew him by a rag on his finger.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Meekin. On the 4th of August the prisoner came down to me with a receipt, and an order on the back to pay it; I paid him 3l. 16s. 6d., which I put into his own hands - he thanked me, and walked out; I never saw him before, but am certain of him; I could swear to him as well as to my own brother: here is the receipt, with the order on the back of it.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner write, but could not swear this receipt is his writing; it appears to me to be feigned hand; he has never accounted for either of these amounts; I am the person he should account to - the bill is attached to this receipt; it is for business done by Milner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know that he came to Mr. Milner's from the service of Mr. Glover, of Watling-street? A. I understood so; I have the rough book here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Turn to the 6th of June - is there any entry of 1l. 7s. from Inglis? A. There is no such entry; he was not authorized to collect on the 4th of August, so there is no entry on that day - there is no entry of the transaction at all.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did he not account sometimes to Mr. Milner as well as yourself? A. No - if Mr. Milner himself receives money he accounts to me for it; it is the prisoner's duty himself to put down the money he received - I never took money from him till he himself entered it, and the party he received it from; there is no entry of his without a name to it - I do not recollect an instance of Mr. Milner having given me money received by him, for he has not been able to attend to business for six months; I make up my account every morning - I pay cash into the banker's, but keep a floating balance; I have never been urged to make up my accounts quicker than I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner delivered in a written Defence, declaring that he had paid the 27s. to Dede, desiring him to enter it, as he had come home wet, but denying that he had ever received the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100086"/>amount from Mr. Meekin's, and stating that the charge arose from vindictive feelings on the part of Dede.</p>

            . Q. Did the prisoner bring the bill with him? A. No; he asked for Mr. Milner's account, which had been left - our regular settling day is the first Tuesday in the month; I paid several others that day - I think he asked for the precise sum, as I always ask what they call for; I am positive of his person - if a stranger had asked for the account, and named the sum I should have paid him.</p>

            . I live in Tower-street, Westminster-road.

There was rather a shorter boy than this before me; I was ten or twelve yards behind him - I saw the handkerchief drop and picked it up - being out of work, I put it into my breast and turned down Whitecross-street; they called Stop thief! I thought I might get away with the handkerchief, which would fetch me 1s. or 2s. - the gentleman called after me; I asked if it was his - he said Yes; and if I would give it him I might go.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Here is the handkerchief I had, it was not torn at all; I was coming through the fair - there was an immense crowd opposite a show - the mob forced me against the gentleman's pocket; he charged me with the robbery - I said I had not seen it; he felt in his pocket, then turned round, saw it laying down, and charged me with it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. Spring keeps the Castle in High Holborn - I was sent for a little before five o'clock in the morning, to No. 12, Gloucester-court; it is a common house - the prosecutor had called the watchman, who called me; I found the prosecutor standing at the street-door - he said he had been robbed of a pocket-book and four sovereigns, by a woman up stairs, who he had been with; I went up with him to the room he said he had been in - I found the prisoner in that room; he pulled her out; he was quite sober - the prisoner stood at the end of the room; his brother and another girl were there - he stated he had called his brother down to inform him of the robbery; I found the pocket-book in the room, close to where the prisoner stood - it was the room they had been to bed in; I searched every where else, but found no sovereigns - a man named Hawkins keeps the house, but does not live in it; the woman who manages it for him came up and told the prisoner she must have it, and recommended her to give it up, saying,"You know I saw it, and you saw it, the night before" - the prisoner said she had not got it; the brother said the woman he had been with could not have taken it - the woman of the house was taken up, but discharged; there was a woman sleeping by herself in another room.</p>

I took the woman and the prisoner - I have often given information of this house to our people; there was a window to the room - the curtains were down; I searched every place as minutely as I could, but did not search any of the women but the prisoner - he insisted that nobody but her could have it, for nobody had been near her; I left the servant to search her more closely than I could -I did not find three shillings on her; she said he had given her three shillings - they were both dressed when I saw them; the servant said she had the key, and she could not get out without being let out.</p>

            . Q. How soon after you went to the house did she take your money? A. In about three quarters of an hour after we went to bed, which was as soon as we had drank the gin - that did not take more than a quarter of an hour; the watchman was not sent for before, because the old woman of the house kept begging her to give me up the money, as she was certain she had it - when I left the room I left my brother sitting with her; the money was not likely to be found on her - she had thrown it through the window, which she owned.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was she drunk? A. I cannot say that she was - I met her by the Blue Posts, and took her to Spring's, but did not stop there a minute after - Mrs. Spring would not let me have any thing to drink; I looked under the bed, and am certain nobody was in the room - I felt her drawing my pocket-book out, and could not resist her; she did not take my waistcoat.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time was this? A. About ten o'clock at night - it was dark, but this was between two lamps; he ran down by the County Fire-office and into another street; here is a mark on the handkerchief; as soon as we had taken him I endeavoured to find who the gentleman was, but he was gone, and I could not find him; I was on the opposite side of the way, and did not lose sight of him as he turned the corner; I swear I saw him throw the handkerchief from his hand at the corner of the Quadrant, where it was quite light; I was hardly five yards from him - I swear I 
saw him take it.</p>

I sprung my rattle, and pursued the prisoner up the street; Williams had picked up the handkerchief - I saw him in a stooping position when the prisoner ran from him; I pursued to Queen-street, he made a halt at the door of the Catherine Wheel, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What distance was the officer from the prisoner? A. I should think not ten yards - there were no sharp turnings, they were in a slanting direction; I did not see the handkerchief thrown away.</p>

On the Tuesday morning the prosecutor came and informed me these things were missing; I went to look after the prisoner by his direction - he said all he wanted was to recover the goods; he thought he had been misled by keeping bad company, and if I would go and get him to give and account of them he would be satisfied; I went - he said he would go and explain to his master; instead of that the foreman came and took part in the affair, and gave him into custody; when he was taken to the Police-office, his master said if he would give up the goods, he would carry the case no further, and upon that assurance, I induced him to give evidence against himself.</p>

I had a stallion, called "The Farmer's Glory;" the prisoner was in my employ for two seasons, to take the horse round to the different farmers, and to different markets - I engaged to give him 5l. for the season, 1s. for every mare that was covered, and he received 3l. 10s. every Monday morning to pay his expences, when he came back at the end of the week he was to give an account of what he had spent; if he had any left he was to return it - if he had spent more it was paid him; when he returned on the Sunday I used to ask him what he received - he said, "None at all," which was the case every Sunday this season; he never paid me any; any money that he received, it was his duty to bring to me; I think he returned me that answer for fourteen or fifteen weeks - the last time I paid him was on the 6th of July, when he left me with the 3l. 10s., and never returned; I received my horse back, I think, on the 17th, with a note in his hand-writing- I waited till the following Sunday, and then sent a person into the country; on the Friday I went to Banbury, where I found the prisoner in custody, and brought him to London; the constable had taken a letter from him, and a book, before I saw him; he afterwards gave me a statement of some sums, which he had never paid me, but I have only a copy of it here.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were the stallions yours or not? A. Yes, I purchased them; I had three of them; the first I bought was a year ago - this is a bill which I had printed; the prisoner was to lead "The Wanderer" and "The Farmer's Glory;" I was a bankrupt since I bought them - I have got my certificate; my effects were sold in May last - it was in March I sent the prisoner out with the stallion; the stallion was bought in by my friends for me; it was sold by auction, and the assignees got the proceeds of it; my friends have no partnership in these stallions - I had settled with the prisoner at the termination of last season; there was no running account - we settled every week: sometimes there were expences of shoeing and physic for which he paid a shilling or two, which I paid him - he did pay Mr. Coleman 1l. 5s., but he always had money in advance - what he paid out of his pocket he was repaid the next week; he behaved very well the first season, or I should not have employed him again. I have read over this book to my sorrow, which the prisoner kept; the names are down here; these sums are entered as not having been paid; they are entered that the parties might be called upon who had not paid - if he received any money he ought to have paid me, but if he had not I was to call on them; if he had not put down those names I should have beard of it, as those gentlemen were often sending their mares.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What do you understand by this entry of the name of Murrell? A. That he had not paid - there was no account between the prisoner and me but the 5l. which I was to pay him at the end of the season, and he had 3l. of that.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not see that book, with Mr. Murrell's name in it, after the 17th of April? A. Yes: I saw it every week, but he did not tell me he had received the money; it is usual to call several times for the money- he was to pay me if he received it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Hollinshed. There was lead in the stable - I met the prisoner that morning with a bundle, and watched him into an old ironshop; I went and told the prosecutor; we went to the house, and asked what he had brought; the man said it was lead - I did not know what it was; I thought it was a bundle of tiles - it was wrapped up in a bundle; when I saw him first he was not above ten yards from the stable; he was in the back yard, with the bundle on his shoulder; it was about a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning - I found the bag that the lead had been in at the old ironshop, but the lead was out, and the bag laid upon it - it was about a quarter of an hour after I saw the prisoner that I saw the lead again at the shop; he is a bricklayer's labourer, and had been at work there some time.</p>

The prisoner came and asked if we bought lead; I said we did not; I said, "Very likely you have not got it in an honest manner;" he said, "Will you let it be here a few minutes;" I made him no answer; but he pushed me aside, put it down, and in a few minutes after the prosecutor came in - he had the same lead.</p>

            . On the Sunday night, the 26th, I tried a little room by the side of my bed-room, and found it locked - I thought my niece had taken the key; in the morning, when she came, I said, "Why did you lock that door?" she said. I did not;" she opened the door, we went in, and missed her bonnet, a cornelian necklace, a pair of ear-rings, two brooches, a silver knife, two shirt-pins, and a great many other things, which I have never seen since - I had seen them safe on the Saturday or Sunday, in the bureau; I know the bureau was fast on the Sunday - whoever took the things must have secreted themselves in the house; the bureau was wrenched all to pieces - the prisoner knew the bureau; and in her father's life time, if we had a little money, it was always put there - I went to Mrs. Pratt's house, and saw the box which my daughter had brought there; I saw a great many things of mine there, and a great number of duplicates - the officer took her; I do not recollect that she said any thing.</p>

On the 17th day of July, in the evening, I met Hall, Reynolds, and Limbrick, at the Jack of Newbury, the corner of Bun-hill-row - I was searched by them and had nothing about me - they then gave me 5s. to purchase some money and 1s. to spend; I did not know whether it was marked -I went to the Barley Mow alone, and saw the prisoner sitting in one of the boxes with other company; I went and asked if he had got any thing for me; he said Yes; but whispered that there were persons there he did not wish to give it me before - we went out to Graham's-buildings, which is a short distance, and he told me he had a score of bobs, which meant bad shillings; he pulled them out of his pocket in a small silk bag - I gave him 5s. for them; he had a bad crown-piece at the time, he wished me to have that - I said I would have that another day; we went back to the Barley Mow - I tossed for some beer, and lost two pots; Hall, Limbrick, and Reynolds then came in - Limbrick advanced up to me, and said, "Ah! old one, I had you twenty years ago;" that is not true, he never had me in his life - I was taken into custody, and searched by Reynolds, who took the silk bag, containing the bobs, out of my right-hand waistcoat pocket; he put it on the table, and asked where I got it; I said, "From that man," pointing to the prisoner; he said, "Me, Sir?" I said Yes; he was then taken and searched, and the 5s. which I had given him found on him.</p>

            . I am a bookseller. My shop is at No. 3, Great Ormond-street - my father is the principal turnkey at Giltspur-street Compter, and has been there eighteen years; I have had my shop in Great Ormond-street about three months, but I sleep at my sister's, No. 40, Great Alie-street. I first saw the prisoner about seven years ago, in the Giltspur-street Compter - I was living there at that time; when he got out I lost sight of him for some time, but saw him again three or four years ago - I saw him again about three months ago; his wife spoke to me about some books, and I saw him on my calling at his house - on Tuesday, the 4th of August, I met him against the dead wall in the King's-road; he asked if I could purchase any stamps - he took off his hat, and produced some stamps on parchment; I took them in my hand, and saw three 30l. stamps, and some that I concluded to be 10l., and some others at 10s. - they laid in my hand like a pack of cards, one over the head of the other; and the way they laid I was prevented from seeing them completely, but the three thirtys were at the top; I said I could not purchase them myself, but I would see some person about them - he said there were about 1400l. or 1500l. worth: that there were two of 140/. each, and the lot would he sold for 300/.; he said he was going to see a party about them, but they would not be gone by the next morning, if I would call at his house - we parted at that time, and I called at his house the next morning; he was not at home - I left word that I would call again at two o'clock; I went at that time and saw him - I had previously looked into the Times, and several other papers, to see if I could see any account of the stamps, as I concluded they were stolen from some law-stationer's; I saw an advertisement in the Times paper - I went to his house at two o'clock, and saw a list of the stamps which he said were to be sold; he then told me they were prigged, by which I understood they were stolen - having seen the list, I found it corresponded with the advertisement; what made me think it was the same, was the two of 140l. - he again told me the price would be 300/.; I left him and went to dinner, and then went to the Stamp-office - I received some directions there what to do, and went to the prisoner's house about nine o'clock in the evening; I left word I should want a copy of the list - he said if I could call in the morning I should have a copy of it; he then said the price would be reduced, and would be from 200l. to 250l., because a portion of the stamps, amounting to 280l., were not to be sold, and he added, that he should expect something for himself; I told him of course he would have something - I told him I had seen the party, and they would not give more than 170/., or there about - I treated him with a pint of porter; we then parted for the evening, and I agreed to see him again the next morning - I called again between ten and eleven o'clock the next morning; he showed me the list which he had shown me previously, but the stamps at the top were struck out; I made a copy of the list, omitting those which were struck out, by his direction, as he said they would not be included in the purchase - this is the list I made out; I believe it nearly tallies with the list he showed me, with the exception of those struck out at top- I of course cannot swear that it does correspond; he told me that the carriage-plate and pawnbroker's licenses were of no use without they were signed by a magistrate, and that made a reduction of 433/. 5s. - after I had taken the copy we parted; I never, on any occasion, asked to see the stamps - they were shown voluntarily; after I had taken the copy; I went again to his house, after that, because an alteration was made in the list - a nought was struck out in 140, and I went for the purpose of adding that; but in the mean time I had seen Ellis and Ruthven, who were then in the neighbourhood, and they had made some arrangements - I saw the prisoner when I went the last time; I said I wished to see the list again, to rectify an error - he allowed me to see it, and I made the alteration; he then placed it on a table, under the window, under some books or a tea-caddy - I then gave the officers information, but did not go to the house again; I brought the list away that I made, and gave it up to the solicitor of the stamps - I had made some figures on the list that I took this copy from.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. In his, or whose hand-writing was that list? A. I do not know; my father was a turnkey of Giltspur-street Compter, seventeen or eighteen years - I lived there seven or eight years; I cannot say how old I was when I left - I might be about eighteen: I am now twenty-five - I made no particular acquaintance with the prisoner while he was there; they do take in thieves and persons of that description, but my father's apartments are quite separate - I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100100"/>prisoner after he left, but had no particular acquaintance with him till this transaction with the books; it was after he showed them me that I looked into the times - I am quite sure I did not show them to him, and ask if he could get rid of them; I concluded, of course, that they were stolen, and of course I knew there was some danger in possessing them - I have been a bookseller, perhaps, about three months, but I was brought up to the profession of the law; I was with Mr. Forrett, the barrister, as his clerk - that was in 1821, 1822, 1823, and part of 1824; I was not clerk to him as a barrister - I have been with his brother since, Mr. Robert Forrett; I have since then been with Mr. Norton and partner, in the Insolvent Debtors' Court - I am also a painter, and deal in pictures and minerals; the reward stated in the advertisement was 50l. - I never, except on that occasion, saw a single stamp in his possession; I cannot tell whether the paper which was left by the books or tea-caddy, was found by the officers - I was placed, for a short time, to the business of herald engraving, and engaged as a manufacturer of chess, backgammon-tables, and dice-boxes, with a person named Parker, in Plummer-street, City-road; I was with him nine or ten months - we parted on amicable terms; he made no complaint against me, except that I spoiled the work - I do not know Saunders, an attorney; I was never in his employ - after I had been to the solicitor of stamps I went to Ruthven and Ellis.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it never occur to you, and did none of them, advise you to bring in some one as a purchaser? A. It was proposed, but it was thought better not; I cannot say who proposed it - there were four or five persons; it might be the solicitor - it was not proposed that I should take some other person to see the same thing, and to confirm what I said; but it was proposed that I should return and look at the list, and then take the person - I recollect Mr. Ruthven proposing that I should take some person as a purchaser, if I did not wish to appear; no one stamp has been found - the prisoner lived on Back-hill, which was in the way from my shop to Great Alie-street: I could not be accommodated with any thing more than the shop at Great Ormond-street - I was going to dine with my father at the Compter, the day I first met him - of course I did not choose to be present when this man was taken up; it was Tuesday when I first saw him, and he was taken on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. When you had seen the stamps, your notion was that they had been stolen from some stationer? A. Yes - it was the advertisement led me to the Stamp-office; in the list I made there were stamps of 140l., and stamps of 30l. - I lived with Mr. Forrett,(now the barrister) three years and a half, and after with Mr. Robert Forrett, who is an attorney.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was employed by the Stamp-office to detect this robbery; Ellis was first applied to, and he told me about it -I saw Balch, but I think not on the first occasion; Ellis and I took the prisoner - I think on Thursday. the 6th of August; I found this paper in a hat, with a handkerchief upon it - I do not recollect any proposition being made as to the mode in which the discovery should be carried on; we were puzzled how to go on with it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many minutes elapsed from the witness coming out of his house and you going in? A. I should think not three - he passed by him, and I went in and searched the prisoner's person; I expected to find the list on his person, but did not - I have seen the writing of law-stationers very much like the writing on this paper; I have seen Balch's writing - it is not like this, according to my view; Balch told me he made the figures at the corner - I have been to the shop in Great Ormond-street, but did not search there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you went into the house you left Balch outside, and expected to find the list on the prisoner's person, but found nothing? A. Yes; the hat on which the paper was found belonged to the prisoner - he put the hat on his head, and the handkerchief I believe he put into his pocket.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you remember suggesting the propriety of sending some one with Balch, in order to confirm him a little? A.

            . I am solicitor to the Board of Stamps. Balch made a communication on the 5th of August, and Ellis and Ruthven, I believe, were sent to; a consultation was held between them, myself, and Balch, as to the best mode of taking the prisoner with the stamps in his possession - I do not recollect any proposition being made about sending any person with Balch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You have said you do not recollect that there was any such proposition? A. I do not remember it - I have heard Balch say there was - he may be right; I cannot contradict it; it did not strike me that there was any thing very singular in what Balch told us - he explained how he became acquainted with the prisoner - it is better to have two witnesses to a fact where you can have them, and perhaps such a proposition might have been made - I do not recollect any meeting at which it was mentioned; if it had been made, I think I should have recollected it.</p>

            , a horse-slaughterer, in Whitechapel-road, opposite the London-hospital. On Saturday, the 22nd of August, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, a horse was brought to me by the prisoner; another man, whom I have known in the neighbourhood for fifteen years, was with him - the man who came with him said I was to give this man 30s. for the horse, and 1s. to him, for shewing him the slaughtering-house; I put a sovereign and a half into the prisoner's hand; I had scarcely done that, before I said to the other man."Why, do you know this man who has brought the horse?" he said he did not; I then said to the prisoner, "Give me my money back again, I have strong donbts on my mind that this is not right;" he immediately gave me back the money - I told him I should detain the horse and money - Mr. Monk was standing in the shed close by; he took him into the counting-house, and questioned him; he was perfectly satisfied that it was not correct, and told me to take him to the office; as we went along, he made a start, and attempted to escape; I, however secured him, and told him it was a folly to put himself in jeopardy for so trifling a thing; he said he had taken the horse from Mr. Wright, of King's Langley, who was a wealthy man, and could well afford to lose it - I took him to Lambeth-street; he said he was a poor man, and had taken the horse out of the field - we wrote that evening to Wright, of King's Langley, but got no answer - it is near Hemel Hempstead.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live at No. 6, Tower-street, Newport-market; I know the prisoner Newitt. On Monday morning, the 3rd of August, about five minutes before six o'clock, he came and knocked at my door; I was not up - my wife let him in; he asked me if I could work - I told him my feet were very bad, I did not know that I could; but he wished me to go very much, and said he would satisfy me for my trouble if I would go - he told me he had sent some things to Mr. Johnson, No. 92, Edgware-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he explain what he meant by things? A. Whether he said sheep I do not know, I imagine he must; I was to go and dress them - he gave me some gamble-hooks, tied in a blue apron; they are to stick in the legs of the sheep to hang them up; I went from there to a gin-shop with him, and he gave me a drop of gin; and from there I went to No. 92, Edgware-road - he did not go with me, I understood him that he was going to Smithfield - he told me to go on to Mr. Johnson's, and there was somebody there to help me kill these things; I parted from him when he told me he was going to Smithfield, and got to Johnson's about half-past seven o'clock - I was very lame, and not able to walk fast; when I got near Johnson's I saw the door was open, and some sheep in the road at a distance - I suppose about thirty, but did not count them; I saw two men at a distance with the sheep; I went into Johnson's shop - there was no person in the shop then; I called Johnson - the sheep were driven into the shop; I assisted to drive them in - the other two men, Mr. Johnson, and other people who were passing, also assisted; they might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour bringing the sheep in; I could not swear to the two other men who were with the sheep - I never saw them before to my knowledge - I never saw the other prisoners to my knowledge till they were at Hatton-garden - I cannot swear at all to them; I never saw them before - if they are the men, they were dressed different at the office, and I considered that one was taller and the other shorter than the prisoners - to the best of my knowledge they were; I then went to get somebody to help me kill these sheep; I returned about half-past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock;

             and a man called Poultice, were the men who returned with me to assist in killing them - when I returned with them I saw Newitt forty or fifty yards on this side Johnson's house; I told him there was nobody there to help me, and I had been to fetch these two men; he asked if we would have some gin, to the best of my knowledge; he said he had heard in Holborn that there was nobody to help - he told us to go and get to work, to get some sheep dead; the men who was with me went and stuck the sheep, and I was stripping ready to dress them - I went in with them; Newitt came in a little time, and brought some ale into the yard in a pot while we were engaged with the sheep - I did not count them and cannot say how many were killed - we killed the whole in the yard, which was about thirty; I did not take notice what breed they were: there was no black one; there was a kind of brown one.</p>
               <p>Q. Come, Sir, was there a black sheep? A. There was a kind of blackish cast sheep; I cannot say it was a black one - I believe Newitt stuck one or two of them himself; but I was engaged in dressing them and took no notice particularly. Newitt said he wished to get them dead soon that they might get stiff, as he wanted to send them to market; we got done between five and six o'clock I think, but cannot exactly say the time: Newitt did not stay till we had done; he left in the morning: I did not see him again till about six, when I saw him at the public-house next door to Johnson's - Wincott and Poultice were there, and Newitt, I believe, paid them for their work; he paid them 3s. or 3s. 6d., I believe, but I cannot exactly say, as I did not count the money. I saw Newitt again that evening, in a cart near the Hop-pole public-house, Edgware-road; it might be between six and seven - a person named Clark was in the cart with him and a little girl; I got into the cart: there was a sack in it containing some substance, but I did not look inside it - I believe it was fat, but cannot say; I believe there were some skins in the cart; they were sheep or lamb skins - we went down to Clare-market in the cart, to Mr. Sadler's; the sack was taken out and delivered into Sadler's - I cannot exactly say whether Clark or Newitt took it out - next day, Tuesday, about six or seven o'clock in the evening, I was at the Green Man public-house, Coal-yard, Drury-lane, and saw Newitt there; other people were in the house - I cannot exactly say who; Newitt then paid me for my trouble.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. About six in the morning you saw somebody drive the sheep into this place? A. Yes, it was broad day-light. I said at the office that my belief was that neither Williams nor Dennington were the men; I believe neither of them are the men I saw.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you known Newitt long? A. Some years; there was no concealment in the transaction; it all took place in open daylight - I cannot tell how far Newitt's house is from Islington, but I suppose about three miles and a half; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100103"/>always understood that he was labouring under dropsy, and he has been rather lumpy, like other butchers; he cannot walk very fast - I did not notice the sheep skins so as to know them again, and cannot speak to them; my business was to dress the sheep.</p>

            . I live in Little Grove-street, Lisson-grove; and am a porter, and keep a horse and cart - I have known Newitt many years. On Sunday evening, the 2nd of August, I saw him at my house - two of the Johnsons' were at my house at the time - Newitt said to Johnson, that as he was out of business, he must do something for a livelihood, and he would buy a few sheep, if he could have a place to carcase them: Johnson told him if he did buy any, to send them to his house and he would kill them for him - he said nothing about killing them at my place, I believe: I might say I had no place that would do - I went to Johnson's next evening with my yokes and pails to fetch some offal for my pigs; I had my pails full of offal and was coming away, when I saw Newitt - he said he wished me to go home with the offal, and then to bring my horse and cart to take away the fat and skins; I took my horse and cart there: my little boy was in it - the fat and skins were put in by some of the men who had been employed; I did not count the skins - they threw them in any how; Newitt was there: they said there was a certain number - I cannot say whether Newitt was there then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did they mention any number, and if so was it in Newitt's presence? A. I do not think he was there - I saw the skins put in, but did not count them; I never had such things in my cart before, and do not know how many there were - there were above twenty, I am confident; I think there were about twenty, or above - there were above twenty; Newitt told me I was to go first to Clare-market with the fat, and the skins were to go to the foot of Blackfriars-bridge; Newitt and my boy went in the cart with me - we took Holloway up at the Hop-pole, in Edgware-road, and got to Sadler's fat house in Clare-market, about seven o'clock; we had all the fat taken out - I went up into the loft to see it weighed - it weighed 30st. 1 lb., I think; while I was there I saw three sovereigns given, I think by young Mr. Sadler, to Newitt in part payment - I had left the skins in the cart at the door; while I was in the house my little boy, who was standing at the door, sang out, "Father, father, somebody has taken our Peggy away;" that is the name of our horse - Newitt was at that time down below, just where the boy was; I went down, and the horse and cart were gone - I found Newitt there, and asked why he took the horse and cart away without my consent or knowledge; he said why did I bring my little boy with me for, I would not do to go with the cart - I abused him very much for taking the cart away; he said, "Never mind, it will be all right bye and bye when the cart will meet us in Holborn" - I went to a public-house in the market with him and Sadler's man; I and my boy then walked with Newitt to the White Horse, Holborn - he said the horse and cart would meet us at that public-house; it came after we got there - I suppose that was about an hour and a half after it had been taken from Clare-market; I cannot positively say who the person was who got out of the cart when it returned, whether it was one or two, but I saw a party go across the road - there were no skins in the cart then; I parted with Newitt directly I got my cart, and went away - Newitt told me to be sure to be in time at Johnson's next morning for the sheep, to take them to Newgate-market; I went there next morning, about half-past five o'clock - I was to have been there at five; twenty sheep were put into my cart there to go to Newgate-market; fourteen were taken to Mr. Pocklinton's, and six to Chandler's, both in Newgate-market - they were left there in Newitt's name.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you make any particular observation of the skins? A. No, not to know them again.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When you came down stairs, after weighing the fat, was the cart gone out of sight? A. Yes; I cannot say who went in it.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When you came to Clare-market, and the fat was taken out, what became of you? A. I went up to the White Horse, Holborn, as Newitt told me if I would go there he would give me something to drink, and pay me for my work - I left the cart standing in the market, and do not know what became of it.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it not usual to be paid at so much a head for dressing sheep? A. Yes; my work was 1 1/4d. a head, but I had to go backward and forward for a man to assist and he gave me 5s. for my trouble, without mentioning the number of sheep, and I did not count them.</p>

            . I am in the employ of my brother, who is a butcher in Edgware-road. On Sunday evening, I was at Clark's house; Newitt was there - I got up next morning about a quarter to eight o'clock, and found some sheep at the house - my brother called me; there were thirty sheep, but I never counted them - one of the drovers, I think, told me there were thirty; I saw the prisoner Dennington as one of the drovers of the sheep that morning - there were three men with the sheep when I got up; Holloway was one - I cannot speak to the person of the third; there was one which we term a black sheep - it had a black face, and was black in the neck - I considered them Leicestershire sheep; one of the men said, "Poke that black b-r in, and that will frighten all the rest." Dennington was there then, but whether it was him used that expression, I cannot say; the sheep were got in - I was not there while they were being killed - I met Newitt by St. Giles's pound about ten o'clock, in a cart, as I was going to Smithfield with my brother; he was going in a direction to my brother's house - he got out, and I said to him, "You have been as good as your word, you have sent thirty sheep home;" he said, Yes -I asked him who he traded with; he told me he bought them of Ebb - I know a person of that name who deals in sheep; I said, "How did you come on?" meaning, how did he buy them - he said he thought he had bought them rather too dear, but he did not know how they would turn out; we had something to drink together at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100104"/>pound, and parted - I went on to market, and he to my brother's; I saw him again about seven o'clock in the evening at my brother's - the sheep had been killed then, and all hung out of doors in public view; he did not say what he meant to do with them - he asked if I would buy any; I agreed that I should have a couple at whatever he might sell the others at market - he had told Clark to come for the offal; I was to buy two sheep for whatever the others fetched at market - it was not said in my presence what was to be done with the rest; I know Mr. Nicholl, and saw him at my brother's next morning -Newitt was there, and sold him two sheep; I remember some of the sheep were double-lined, as we term them - it is customary for butchers in general to put a mark of their own on them; I do not consider that these had any butcher's mark.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you take any particular notice of the skins? A. No, I should not like to swear to them. I have known Newitt seventeen or eighteen years; I am certain he was not the third person who drove the sheep in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. At what time did you first see the sheep? A. About a quarter to eight; my brother's name is William - he had been up before me, and came up to call me; his daughter was up before him, and she called him - they had a better opportunity of seeing the sheep and the men than I did; I had not been acquainted with Dennington - I have seen him at work at Smithfield before among a variety of drovers, but never spoke to him; I conceived it to be a fair and open transaction - there was no concealment about it; I was not desired to say nothing about it - the sheep were exposed as publicly as possible when dressed.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How far are Thompson's layers from Johnson's? A. Nearly three miles, I should think; I have no doubt of Dennington being one of the men.</p>

            . I am sometimes called Poultice - I am a butcher and porter, and live in Newgate-market. I know Holloway, and remember going with him to Johnson's, in Edgeware-road, on a Monday in August to kill some sheep - thirty were killed; I assisted - I cannot say what breed they were; Wincott was there - he skinned them; I legged them all but two; I have since been shewn twenty-seven skins by Limbrick - I examined them, but cannot say whether they are the skins of the sheep which were killed that morning, but they were in the same way as I generally leg sheep; there was one black sheep, and there was the skin of a black sheep among those shewn to me, and only one.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, I ask what your belief is as to to their being the skins of the sheep you killed? A. I do not know them any more than by legging them, and there was a black sheep among them, but I do not know by the legging whether they are the skins or not - I cannot say whether they are or are not the same: I believe they are the skins, but the only reason I have is that they are legged as I leg them, and there was a black one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What do you mean by legging? A. Skinning the fore and hind quarters; other persons may leg them in the same way.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in the Edgware-road. I remember thirty sheep being brought to my house on the 3rd of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning; they were Leicestershire sheep: one was a black one: two men accompanied them- Williams was one of them; Newitt came to my house that day - I advised him to kill only ten, and send the others out to field; he said he thought he should kill about fifteen, but when I came home they were all killed; it being hot whether I thought it not right to kill them all- when they came Williams said he had brought some sheep for Mr. Newitt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How often were you examined at the office? A. Twice, or, I believe, three times; I said at the two first examinations, that I could not swear to Williams, but said at the third examination I could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You were up before your brother that morning? A. Yes; my little girl called me - I did not take particular notice of the sheep - it did not strike me that there was any thing wrong.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Explain how it is you can swear to Williams? A. The first time I was examined I saw his full face, and said I could not positively swear to his being the man; at the second examination I was not asked any thing about him, but when I came out of the office, having seen his side face, I told Limbrick I was satisfied he was the man; I have not the least doubt of him now.</p>

            . I am Johnson's daughter. I remember thirty sheep coming to my father's house, about seven o'clock in the morning; I opened the door - Dennington was there (pointing to him) - the sheep were not there then; Dennington said was that Mr. Johnson's - I said Yes; he said the sheep were a little higher up, and he would go and fetch them - I saw them brought in; there was a black one among them: I went and told my father.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you no doubt about Dennington? A. No; I did not know him before - he was not pointed out to me at the office; I pointed him out - the Magistrate told me his name; my uncle pointed over to Dennington just now, while I was looking about; I have always told the same story about this - I have said it was on a Friday that the sheep came, and I say so now; I have no more doubt of that than I have of Dennington's person.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Whether it was Friday or not, was it the same day as the sheep were killed? A. Yes; I saw Mr. Newitt there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How soon afterwards did you see the man? A. He was about half an hour gone for the sheep - I saw the same man again on a Tuesday, not the next Tuesday; it was a fortnight or more after - I had never seen Dennington before; I only saw one person come with the sheep myself - I was standing on the stairs when they drove them in; my uncle and father were present<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100105"/>when I saw Dennington in the shop - I am quite sure it was Friday.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Was when you were before the Magistrate the first time you saw Dennington after that? A. Yes - the Magistrate pointed him out then; I had pointed him out myself before the Magistrate told me his name - the Magistrate then said his name was Dennington - there were four people at the office when I pointed him out; there were no more prisoners there - he stood at the end of the bar; there were other people standing at the end of the bar; I was not told the people who had been at our house were standing there - only one person besides him stood at the end of the bar; nobody had told me he was the man.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You opened the door to Dennington - did you continue in the shop, or go up stairs? A. I stood on the stairs, about an hour, while they were driving them in; the door opens into the shop - I could see the shop from the stairs; my uncle and father came into the shop; I called them while he was gone for the sheep - when they were driven in Dennington came into the shop, so did my uncle and father; I saw no other man came in, nor did I see any body outside; I stood on the stairs till they were driven in- I never saw thirty sheep come into my father's at any other time.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When he gave you the 5l. note, where was he? A. In front of the bar; Williams and Dennington were in the tap-room. and could not hear or see any thing of it; when I brought the four sovereigns he was in the tap-room, sitting with them, and I gave them to him there- he asked me after I changed the 5l. note if I would take care of a good deal of money for him - I spoke to my wife, and she would have nothing to do with it; he had a good deal of money, and put it into his fob - he had between 100l. and 200l. about him, for he asked me if I would take care of between 100l. and 200l. for him.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live at Mr. Bonington's Coal-yard, Drury-lane. Newitt lodged in the second floor back room, and I live in the first floor back room. On Monday, the 3rd of August, at three o'clock in the morning, there was a knocking at the door; I looked out of window and saw two persons - they were Williams and Dennington; they asked me if Mr. Newitt was at home - I think it was Williams spoke; I said I believed he was - I went up and called him; he came down, and went out about five minutes after I called him, but I cannot say whether they all went together - I went to hed again - I saw Newitt again, at home, about twelve o'clock that day; I saw him next day at the Green Man, Coal-yard, with Williams, Dennington, and Holloway - they were all drinking together that afternoon; I had seen Dennington and Williams before that morning, and had spoken to them five or six times before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Newitt lived at the house? A. Yes; he is married. I saw Williams and Dennington go away when I gave them the answer at the window; I did not see Newitt go out - I saw him at his bed-room door when I called him; he appeared as if he had just got of bed - I did not stay at the window above a minute; I only gave the answer to each person - I cannot say whether Dennington and Williams came back and talked with Newitt at the street-door; I have heard Newitt complain of dropsy before this happened - he was very much swollen; I have not observed it affect him so as to prevent him making any great exertion - I heard him go up again, and dress himself afterwards, and go down again in five minutes; he was up stairs long enough to dress, and he went out - I did not see him go out, but I heard the street-door shut directly after he went down; I heard him go down when I called him, heard him go up again, and then down, and never heard him go up again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. There can be no mistake about time? A. No - I heard the clock strike during the time I was out of bed; I do not suppose I was out of bed three minutes altogether - I do not burn a light; it was not very dark - the moon was -</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it was a moonlight morning? A. It was moonlight and daylight together, so that I could distinguish - I will not swear it was moonlight; I cannot say there was a moon - it was not clear daylight at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say there was a moon? A. Because I could not recollect whether it was daylight or not; I did not see the moon, and will not swear there was one - it was so far daylight that I can swear to the prisoner's if you put them among 20,000 men; it was both daylight and moonlight together - it was not raining then; I did not look to see if the ground was et - one man stood answering me, and the other a little distance off; I only looked at the mens' faces, their appearance and dress - I took particular notice of them; I do not know whether there was a moon or not - I did not see it; it was between daylight and moonlight, because I know it was about the time the moon was up - my recollection is furnished by a knowledge of the state of the moon and the night; it was the third quarter - I am sure of that; I do not know when the moon was new - I calculate from the last time of the new moon, that it was the third quarter; I do not know when it was new, only from seeing it full on Sunday or Saturday night last - I will not swear it was the third quarter; I swear I have not sworn it was.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Had you any expectation of being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100106"/>examined on the state of the weather? A. No - there was light enough for me to distinguish their persons, and I am certain of them; I told them Newitt would be down directly, and then they went away from the door - they came to the door; I did not hear the street-door open the first time Newitt went down - he came up in about two minutes, or two minutes and a half, and I heard him go down again in about two minutes and a half; I then heard the door shut, and did not hear him return up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The moment they came to the door they asked if Newitt was at home? A. Yes - I said I believed he was; they asked me to call him - I went up and told him two men at the door wanted to speak to him; he came, opened his door, and told me to tell them he would be down directly - I told them so, and did not see any more of them; I heard him come down stairs directly -I did not hear him open the door or speak to them; I heard him come up again - I heard him moving about in his room over head, and go down in about two minutes and a half, and heard the front door shut; I had not heard it opened - I think it was possible for him to dress and come down in the two minutes and a half he was up stairs.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you know the two prisoners before? A. Yes - I had seen them four or five different times, and have spoken to them in the street.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. When had you last a job of painting? A. The last job I did was for Mr. Leggatt, the witness, at a house in West-street, Walworth - he paid me for the job; I began it on the 5th of August - it took six days; I came here to day with Leggatt - we did not go before the Magistrate together; I was summoned there - I had told Bonington, the landlord, and Leggatt, what I knew; Mrs. Bonington told Limbrick I was the person who answered them from the window.</p>

            . I am keeper of the watch-house in Albany-street, Regent's-park. On the 3rd of August, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, a man, who is not here, brought in a sheep skin, and about five next morning, a watchman, who is not here, brought in another - I kept them both, and went on the Tuesday morning, between seven and eight o'clock, to take a walk by the Regent's-canal, and found a parcel of sheep skins in a heap: I was with my horsepatrol, and in the evening be fetched them to the watch-house - there were twenty-five; there was one black skin among them - I gave the twenty-seven skins to William Gordon; Clare-market is about two miles from that spot - none of the skins were entirely in the water, but on the bank; one of them hung on the butment of the bridge - they appeared to have been thrown over carelessly.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Neal. On Sunday night, the 3rd of August I took a flock of seventy-one sheep, by his direction, to Mr. Thompson's layer - they were Leicestershire breed; I noticed the marks on the skins - I saw six skins in Limbrick's possession at the office, and can take upon myself to say they are the skins of six of these sheep - there was a black one in the flock, and a black skin among those.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was on Sunday night; do you remember whether it was a rainy night? A. I think not; it would be neither light nor dark at three o'clock in the morning - it would be break of day.</p>

            . I am a constable. On Friday, the 28th of August, I apprehended Newitt at the Wellington, Wellington-street, Pentonville; he said he was not sorry he was apprehended; he intended to give himself up - this was nearly a month after the robbery - Pentonville joins Islington.</p>

I cannot say that he did - I will not swear he did not - he had no conversation with Limbrick that I know of; he appeared very infirm, and swollen with dropsy much more than he is now - I should think it would be difficult for him to walk five miles together.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you ever at Marlborough-street Office? A. Yes, once - I was not charged with doing any thing - there was no accusation made against me of stealing a watch; I had a ticket of a watch in my possession which had been stolen, not knowing it to be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100107"/>stolen - I gave it up to the officer, and got nothing for it; I was discharged directly.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you mean to mix the gaslight with the day and moonlight? A. No; it did assist me to see the prisoners - I did not mention it, because I was not asked - I have not said there was "daylight" enough; the daylight assisted the gaslight - I lived in Smart's-buildings when I had the duplicate - I have lived three years in that house.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Why did you leave there? A. Because the woman who lived there went into the almshouse - a Mr. Cave took it, and ordered all the lodgers out; I went from there to where I now live; it was twelve months ago last February, and have lived there ever since.</p>
               <p>NEWITT'S Defence. I can prove that from six o'clock in the morning till ten in the day what became of me - I did not go out of the house till six o'clock in the morning of the 3rd of August.</p>

On the day of my apprehension, Waddington came and said I was wanted; I said directly, "Shall I come now?" he said No, he did not want me now, by and bye would do; I said I would go directly, or wait at home for him at my mother's; I waited there for about an hour; he never came: I went out to sell my plums, and then Limbrick came - I told him I was just coming to him to know what he wanted of me, as I had just done my plums.</p>

            . I am landlady of the house Newitt and Surby lived in in August last. On Monday, the 3rd of August, I saw Newitt at three o'clock in the morning, and I saw him again about six - I then met him in the passage of the house going into the yard, where there is a privy - he appeared as if he had just got up in a hurry, with his stockings down, and the knees of his breeches not tied; he appeared to be going to the water-closet; he had been infirm and dropsical for some time before.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. How long had he lived at your house? A. About ten days before, but I had known him about twelve months - he had kept a butcher's shop; I was not particularly intimate with him; I used not to walk out with him - I cannot swear I never went out with him, as he came to my house on a Saturday, and I went out with him on Sunday; at least I and my husband met him, and he said he was going to Lisson-grove, we went with him; I have not been out with him since, to my knowledge - I do not know the Castle in Holborn; I have not been to a public-house in Holborn with him since the robbery, to my knowledge; I am not bound to swear what I am not convinced of; I have not been out with him since the robbery to my knowledge; I do not know the other two prisoners - I cannot swear to them; I cannot swear I never saw them at my house - to the best of my knowledge I have not; I do not undertake to swear any thing of the kind - the officer came to my house a great many times; Newitt was not in my house when Limbrick came - I never saw any officer but him there; I was at home three or four times when he came - Hall came with Limbrick afterwards; Newitt was not in the house at any time when the officer came, that I will swear.</p>
               <p>Q. The first time you saw Newitt was about three o'clock? A. Yes; I was up then, for my husband, when he gets liquor (which is not very often) is like a madman, and I am afraid to go to bed with him, and sit up - he was at home and in bed at this time; I was up and dressed, and about three o'clock Newitt came down stairs; I heard Surby call him - my door was shut, it is close to the street door; my room is on the ground floor - my door continued shut all the time; I saw Newitt going up stairs; I did not consider that he had shut the street door after he had answered somebody, and I opened my door; I went out to see if it was shut and fastened, and it was fastened - I turned towards the staircase and saw Newitt going up stairs; he had nothing on but a pair of dark or black trousers; I had not heard him speak to any body at the door - I did not go to bed at all; I did not hear him come down again, to the best of my knowledge; I do not think he ever went out of the house; I have had some conversation with Surby - I told him I considered he was telling very great falsehoods in saying the man went out, for I did not go to bed, and was certain he did not go out.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not say to Surby that you recollected seeing Newitt come in the morning, at a quarter to eight o'clock, with his shoes all over dust? A. I take my oath I never did, nor any thing of the sort; I saw Newitt again about six o'clock - our men knock at the door about six, some of them came rather before six - it was not about five or ten minutes after that I saw him; it was shortly after six, for our men are very punctual - I was giving the key of the street door when I met Newitt, just as if he had come from his bed; it was not above five or ten minutes after six - he was partly undressed; my house is five or ten minutes walk from Newport-market.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he could not be out and dressed, calling on a man in Newport-market, before six o'clock? A. I cannot say; that is the time I saw him.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is your husband? A. A coach-smith; Newitt's wife lived with him at our house - he never took any liberties with me; I was awake from three to six o'clock: I do not consider that I closed my eyes a moment - I sat not exceeding two yards from the street door; and from three to six o'clock heard nobody leave the house, nor any one come down stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you not, on the 3rd of August, the day of the robbery, go with Newitt to the Castle in Holborn? A. I could not attempt to swear such a thing; I have drank with him on several occasions, when he lived in Rose-street and Turnstile - I have not told Mr. Oldershaw that I went on the 3rd of August with Newitt to the Castle; he asked me that question this morning: I told him I was not bound to answer such questions - I did not say I was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100108"/>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did Mr. Oldershaw ask you questions? A. Yes, two or three; I told him I was a witness for the prisoner; he and another gentleman questioned me outside.</p>
               <p>JESSY SURBY re-examined. I have had some conversation with Mrs. Bouington about the robbery; she told me she heard Newitt go out of the door about five minutes past three o'clock on the Monday morning, and come in about a quarter to eight that morning with his shoes all over dust - I cannot say what day she stated this.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was any body present? A. Her sister; she told me that I was correct in my statement about his going out soon after three o'clock, and that he came in again about a quarter to eight with his shoes all over dust; she did not say I was a liar for stating what I had, nor any thing to that effect - I had been to Hatton-garden at the time of this conversation; I did not state this to any body - I did not mean to do it, till I heard she was going to appear against me, to try and transport me; I then thought I would peach her, and repeat every thing I knew - I have no spite towards her, nor ill feeling; I have a good will towards her, for I know she cannot transport me - she told me she heard Newitt speak to Dennington and Williams; I told Mr. Oldershaw, the attorney, so last Thursday - I do not know that peaching is a cant word; I know nothing about cant words - I have heard it several times; I heard it both before and after I got the watch ticket.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was it from a back room you answered the men? A. I sleep in the one pair back room - the knocking was at the front door; I went to the staircase window to answer them - there was a single knock first, and then a double one came, like a postman.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. To how many persons in August may you have sold sheep? A. I cannot state, probably within thirty of the number of persons, but I could tell within one whose names I have sold to on one particular day in August - I cannot tell within fifty of the persons I sold sheep to in August, not as to the number, but I can tell their names within one; I have no foreman, or any body who sells sheep for me - persons do sell for me when I am absent, but I was not absent in August during the hours for the sale of sheep; I will swear nobody sold sheep for me - I swear I was never absent for an hour during the hours of sale; my knowledge of persons to whom I sell is chiefly derived from my transactions with them- I could not identify every person I sold to; I cannot swear nobody bought sheep of me on Newitt's behalf, but I swear they did not buy in his name - if a man buys of me I give an account of them in the name of the buyer, and, in some instances, in the name who he should use; it is common for persons to buy for others - the name they buy for are entered, and if that name is not given to me I enter them in the name of the purchaser; I have sworn there is no other William Ebb in London, a salesman - I cannot say there is no other William Ebb; I do not know such a salesman, and will swear there is not one- no person can be a public salesman without my knowing it; there are a great many other public markets for the sale of sheep, but only one for the sale of live sheep in London - I know nothing about dead sheep; I do not mean to say live sheep may not be sold without my knowledge, but there is no other market for live animals - sheep may be sold in a lane; there is not a sheep salesman named

               <p>COURT. Q. How many market days are there in a week? A. Two, Monday and Friday; I recollect very well that I was in Smithfield on Monday, the 3rd of August; I did not sell thirty sheep to Newitt that day, nor any - I did not speak to him that day, to my knowledge; I have known him for five or six years - he has dealt with me; he formerly was a butcher; I do not know how long he has ceased to keep a shop, but I have not sold him any sheep this year; I did not sell thirty sheep to him, nor to any body in his name, on the 3d of August - it is both a ready money and credit market; the market hours are from four o'clock in the morning till three in the afternoon, or twenty minutes after; I attend generally within twenty minutes under or over five - no sales of sheep take place before I get there; I have been at Smithfield-market every Monday, for the last twenty years, and every lot of sheep, amounting to twenty-five, I have sold myself on all those Mondays - no agent or person has been deputed to act for me on a Monday; each buyer who pays for sheep, goes and enters his name in the money taker's office - so many sheep, such a price; I sell sheep on commission for any body who sends them - I never sold sheep for Newitt, except half a dozen once because he was absent; he is a salesman himself.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long had this lad been employed in the office? A. I suppose from five to six months - he continued to come there after the property was lost, and was taken into custody on the Saturday, at his father's house; I think the iron safe belongs to the Company; the different clerks deposit money there - I did not collect this money as a clerk, but as an agent myself; I did not deposit it there on account of the Company - I pay it over perhaps five or six months after; the marked sovereigns had been there more than a month - nobody but myself took money from that box; I took the key of the box away in my pocket - Mr. Tolkein had the key of the safe; Tolkein put the box into the safe after I had locked it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the cash-box belong to the Company or yourself? A. It had been lent to me by the secretary; it belonged to the Company - I had not accounted to the secretary for the money in the box; the secretary deposits money in the safe.</p>

            . I am chief clerk at the Norwich Union office. I remember putting Mr. Boutillier's cash-box into the safe on the 13th of July - I locked it up with two boxes which I am in the habit of depositing there every evening; I believe the prisoner was there at the time - he was there till four o'clock; I left Mr. Boutillier, the prisoner, and another clerk in the office - Mr. Pleas, I believe, was likewise present; on the following morning, as soon as I put the key to the safe, the folding doors opened of themselves - I found it was unlocked; I sent for Mr. Marriott, who examined the lock in my presence - I found my two boxes there, but Mr. Boutillier's was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you locked the safe you put the key into your pocket? A. Yes - it was a small key, and had never been out of my possession; it was the key of the inner door - the outer doors were left open; the inside is fitted up with iron doors, and the upper part is fitted up for books: the junior clerks have access to the books, and we consider it not necessary to lock the outer doors - the key of the outer door is kept in a drawer; I believe Mr. Pleas had that key - I did not tell him he might have it; I believe the secretary had told him so - that key was deposited in a drawer next the iron safe; the secretary residing on the premises takes care of that key - the outer door was not locked before I left the office; I left Mr. Pleas there, and believe he had that key - my box remained.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was Mr. Boutillier's cash box locked up in the same place as yours? A. Yes, and the key of the inner door was never out of my possession; the cash boxes were locked up as safe as if there had been no outer door - the key of the outer door would not open the inner.</p>
               <p>MR. MARRIOTT. I am an ironmonger, and live in Fleet-street. I was sent for to the office immediately on this robbery being discovered; I examined the locks of the inner safe - the doors were put too, and I was asked to look at them to form an opinion by what means they had been opened - I examined with a candle, and said there were marks of some instrument I found they opened; I took the lock off, and found part of the lock broken off, and marks where an instrument had been employed - it could not have been done with the proper key.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The key of the outer door was left with you? A. Yes - the other clerks left at four o'clock; I went out for a short time, leaving the prisoner there - I believe he was at work at his books; I was certainly not out more than a quarter of an hour - I was waiting at the private door when I saw him, and we went in together; he went to copy a policy - I went away for a very short time again, and left him writing something in the office, and found him doing the same when I came back; I saw him out of the office when I left - he lives in Chenies-street, Tottenham-court-road; when I locked the outer doors of the safe the inner doors appeared locked.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What he had done at the time you were away, was it in your power to tell? A. No - I did not try the inner doors; there is no difference in the appearance of a locked door and a closed one.</p>

His sister did - I do not know whether she was there on the day this happened; I cannot say whether she was there while I was - if she had come to the place the safe was in, while I was in the office, I think I must have seen her; I was absent about ten minutes.</p>

I found twenty-nine sovereigns behind the skirting, on the stairs, and with a pitchfork, in the privy, I pulled up the bottom of the tin box, and then the top, but the interior was produced by another person - I apprehended the prisoner at Spittle's livery-stables, in Frances-street; he was standing there.</p>

            . I am a performer at the theatre in Tottenham-street. I have a slight acquaintance with the prisoner - he overtook me in a gig at Pimlico, on the 13th of July, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening; I got into the gig and rode with him to the Red House at Battersea, and while there he offered to lend me 5l. or 10l. - he pulled a handful of sovereigns out of his waistcoat-pocket; he seemed to have about fifteen, and he produced the interior part of a cashbox from under the seat of the gig - it fell from the seat as he was sitting on it; it was empty - I said, "What have you got that for;" he said, "I have been to buy it, but it won't answer the purpose I want it for - if it is of any service to you you may have it" - I said it would answer many purposes I could put it to; we took it to the Red House - we had some stout, and as I was returning I was carrying it under my arm; he said I need not carry it in such a public place - I said, "I am not ashamed of it;" I carried it to my house, and produced it before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he ever offer to lend you money before? A. Never - I had seen him but twice; I only intended to ride about one hundred yards with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100112"/>him, but he got me to go over to the Red House - I did not take any money from him.</p>
               <p>MR. LE BOUTILLIER. I have examined this cash-box; it is exactly the same as mine - this interior part is exactly like the one I lost; there is no mark on it - here are eight of the sovereigns which I am certain are the same as were marked for me by Howell; this paper is my hand-writing, and is the same as I left in the cashbox - (reads) "Coach 3s. 6d. Pleas 8s. 6d."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell what is the mark on the sovereigns without looking at them? A. A dot made with this instrument.</p>
               <p>MR. HOWELL. These eight sovereigns are exactly like those I marked - I have no doubt about them myself; I identified them at Witt's house - at the time they were found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. They have the same dot on them? A. Exactly the same - they could only be marked the same by the same description of instrument; it was a broken instrument.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you that broken instrument here? A. Yes, it corresponds; if one was marked now with it, it would be exactly the same.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Has that instrument been out of your possession since? A. Yes (here the witness marked a sovereign with it); I delivered to Mr. Boutillier the sovereigns I marked, and saw him put them in his box.</p>
               <p>MR. LE BOUTILLIER. I had to use the cash-box every day, and continually kept the sovereigns at the bottom of it - I am certain there were marked sovereigns at the bottom of the box; I had seen Mr. Howell mark them - they had been there from the time they were marked; the box was deposited in the safe every night.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see them the day they were missed? A. Yes - I did not take them out, but saw they were there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This paper, which is said to have been found in a box in my bed-room, is said to have been in the cash-box at the time of the robbery; now there is a drawer in the office at the left side of Mr. Boutillier's desk, which contains waste-paper - it was put there for wastepaper a month or three weeks before the robbery; I took it out of the drawer: it was larger than it is now - I made a memorandum on it, tore it in two, took the piece I made the memorandum on, and put the other into my pocket, and at night I make it a rule to lock up every thing I have in my box - if I had committed the robbery, is it likely I should have returned every day to the office and be cross-examined as I was twice - I solemnly declare, before every body here, I am as innocent as you are yourselves.</p>
               <p>MR. LE BOUTILLIER. I am certain the memorandum was in the cash-box locked up with the cash at the time I put it in the safe on Monday evening; the memorandum was a recent thing - it might have been in existence about a fortnight before. I had a drawer in which I kept waste-paper about three months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was not the paper on which you made the memorandum larger than it is now? A. How can I say that; it is the very same paper and is the same size as it was then, I think - I will not swear I did not make the memorandum on half a sheet of paper - How can I tell?</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is that paper in your hand writing? A. It is; the 3s. 6d. might have been laid out a fortnight before - Pleas had paid me some money and this was the balance; he had paid it me since Midsummer: it was about some rent - he might have paid it me a fortnight after Midsummer - I never wrote the memorandum on any other piece of paper, and it was in the box on the 13th of July; I used to keep my cash in the drawer near my seat, and from time to time I found a deficiency in that drawer - it was a drawer for general purposes and waste-paper; I never put the memorandum in that drawer - the drawer is there still.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the box regularly replaced in the safe every night, or left at Islington? A. It was always in the safe; I kept it there not at Islington.</p>
               <p>COURT to MR. TOLKEIN. Q. When the office hours are over, is that part of the office appropriated to the business locked up so as to prevent Mr. Bunyon from going into it? A. No; it is accessible to him or any of his family.</p>
               <p>Eleven witnesses deposed to the prisoner's good character.</p>

I was at the coffee-house, and in consequence of information from the last witness I followed the prisoner and the other out; and when we got about two yards into the street, they were stopped by Argent and the watchman - I happened to be about a yard behind the prisoner, and saw his right hand coming out of his coat pocket with a white handkerchief in it, and the end of the spoon peeping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100113"/>out of the handkerchief - I immediately collared him, caught his hand, and held it with the handkerchief in it; I said, "You will see the spoon here," and took it out of his hand - he held out his hand, and said, "Oh, I have got nothing."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do not you recollect saying at Guiddhall that when you took the spoon out of my hand that you said, "That is not it?" A. I did not say so - I marked the spoon with my initials, and gave it to the officer.</p>

On the Thursday morning, before the 30th of July, he got up first, and went down stairs; I got up about seven o'clock, and saw a bundle hanging on a nail in my bed-room - some of our shop-twine was hanging through a hole in it; I took it down, and found some skeins of silk, some cotton, a purse, a half-sovereign, a crown, two half-crowns, and a quantity of my master's property - there was a cheque-book, a number of billheads, and some paper - I called a young man, and we showed them to Mr. Rotherham; in about an hour I was called into the counting-house, and found the prisoner -Mr. Rotherham said to me, "This boy denies these things, and says they don't belong to him;" I said to the prisoner,"It is of no use your denying it, it must be your's, and you took them;" Mr. Rotherham said it was of no use his denying it, he would bottom the affair, and he had better tell the truth; he then said he took them, and he had taken some cotton, needles, and worsted home, and they were in a school-box, in the back-parlour - the officer and I went to his mother's, after he was gone to Worship-street; when we got to the house, the officer asked Mrs. Snow whether she had a son in the employ of Rotherham and Grinsell; she said, Yes; he asked if she had any of their property in her house; she said, No; she then said,"His aunt has been here, and I have been looking into the school-box, and found these two parcels" - Attfield said, "Have you got any more?" she said No; he said,"We must look," and we found two more lots in the parlour, in different places, in boxes and drawers - here is cotton, needles, tape, and silk, such as they have in their shop; the whole amount, I should think, is about 3l.; the cottons have our name on the label, and the needles have our private mark on the paper.</p>

               <p>Cross-exmained by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who are your employers? A. William Rotherham and John Hill Grinsell - I have sold things out of the shop with these labels on them - I sometimes find needles and things about the shop, but these are done up in papers.</p>

I went to the house of the female prisoner, at No. 31, Gloucester-street, Commercial-road - it is about three quarters of a mile from the prosecutors' - she opened the door; I asked if her name was Snow; she said Yes; I asked if she had a son at Rotherham and Grinsell's; she said Yes; I asked if she had ever received any goods belonging to them - she said not to her knowledge - I took her into the back-parlour, and read the warrant - I asked if there were any goods there; she then opened the drawer, and gave out two parcels, which she said she had taken from the boy's box, and intended to take to the prosecutors' - I said, "Is this all;" "I believe it is," she said; I said I must search, and in different parts I found these papers of needles, cottons, and other things - this other parcel I got from Capey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the husband of this woman living? A. Yes, and I believe he sleeps in the front-room, in consequence of this woman's mother being there, and sleeping with her - her husband is coachman to a gentleman in the City.</p>

I said, "It is too true;" he declared that he knew nothing about them; the next day he came on board again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100114"/>and went below - a person came to inquire for a package, and it was not found; in looking for it, I saw the prisoner in the larboard after-cabin, stooping down; I asked him if he knew any thing of the package; he said No; I was then coming up again - he said, "Look here;" he pointed down, and lifted up a night-cap with fifty-eight dollars in it; it was under his couch; I desired him to let it he till I had called one of the Dock clerks - he appeared as if he had accidentally hit upon it; he said he was looking for his shoe, and found the night-cap under the coach; the whole crew on board the ship, were thirty-seven or thirty-eight, but they had all left the ship except some boys.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not you bring a prostitute on board to sleep with you in your cabin? A. Not in my cabin, in one of the other cabins; I did not say any thing against the prisoner - there was much said against him, but not by me; he came on board the ship from time to time; the Magistrate admitted him to bail; he never slept in the same cabin with me - he slept in the cabin in which the dollars were found; it was sometimes open and sometimes shut - there is a water-closet in it for the passengers; it is not open to all - the prisoner had gone on shore three times before he found the dollars, but I do not think he had an opportunity of taking them on shore; prostitutes are often thieves - I was not in her company the whole of the time she was on board, but I can swear she never left the cabin, because the door was kept locked; I had gone on deck, and while I was there I could not see the cabin door.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did that woman come on board? A. About half-past eleven or twelve o'clock at night, and staid till six the next day; the trunk was not kept locked, but the door of the cabin was; the prisoner had complained of the Custom-house officer going into that cabin to the water-closet - we had other passengers on board, but not in that cabin.</p>

            . I am third officer on board this vessel. I was ill and on my couch in a cabin opposite the one the dollars were found in; about ten o'clock Briggs went on shore, and in about half an hour I heard a person, who I thought was the prisoner, come down the ladder with an immense quantity of dollars - he was emptying them out; and the next day I heard Mr. Briggs say he had lost a great number, unless Mr. Martin had taken care of them; I said he might make himself easy, for Mr. Martin had taken care of them; I did not speak to the prisoner at the time I heard him; I believe he slept in that cabin, because I heard a midshipman come and call him about ten o'clock the next morning - I heard a Custom-house officer come to that cabin; Martin said, "Who is that?" he said, "It is I;" and he told him to go on deck.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. What time did the witness bring the woman on board? A. I think about an hour after I heard the prisoner come down; I slept in the starboard after-cabin; I could not see the prisoner, but I heard him; if any person had asked me, I should have said it was Martin; I heard his foot, and heard him cough - I never said though I was not certain, yet I would swear to him; he was called at night and went on deck, and then came down again; it was a passenger's cabin, who had left at Dover - I did not suspect him; he came on board, and eat and drank with the prosecutor; they were on the closest intimacy the whole voyage; he has been appointed chief officer of the ship.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. I understand you said the dollars were safe because Martin had taken them? A. Yes; I thought he took them to take care of for Mr. Briggs, as they were so intimate; I told Mr. Briggs of it when he came on board, and he inquired of Mr. Martin when he came on board; the cabin in which the dollars had been was on the deck on the larboard side - I heard that door shut, as I suppose, and a person come down and go into the other cabin - he was afterwards called and went on deck; it was after that I heard the dollars taken, and some one come down from the awning after-cabin; I do not think I had been asleep for three nights.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Have you any reason to suppose that it was Martin that came down, otherwise than by supposing he had left the cabin? A. I supposed it was him; I expected he would have remained on deck, but I supposed he came down.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it his duty to remain on deck? A. Yes; he was called to look out - there would have been no person on deck with him but the Custom-house officer.</p>

             re-examined. Q. When Fell told you your money was safe as Martin had taken it, did you speak to Martin? A. Yes; when he came on board he said, "Is it true that you have lost your money?" I said it was too true; on the Saturday after I had been at the Thames Police, he said he had received an anonymous letter - he showed it to me, and asked if I knew any thing about it; I said No - but I suspected him, and there was evidence which I intended to have looked into as soon as I had time; he said he had not taken the money, and had not so much, or he would pay it me rather than have his name made public; when I went on shore that night, I told a boy to give Mr. Martin the key of my cabin - when I returned I got the key from him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where did you pay the woman from? A. From the desk, in dollars; after the letter had been received the prisoner left me, and on Monday I went to the Thames Police.</p>

             Forbes; I found Mr. Fell sick in bed- Mr. Briggs told me the dollars were lost; I went down to Mr. Fell, and told him - he said he heard something like dollars, by the sound of them, in the next cabin; I said, "Who slept there?" he said Martin - I said it could not be Mr. Martin; he said "No, it could not be him, if it had been him I should have known him," and he said if it had been Martin he must have taken them to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100115"/>hide from Briggs; for, about an hour before Briggs went on shore, Martin said, "Are you not going to pay the men some of their dollars before you go on shore?" - he said, "No, I shall pay them at my pleasure."</p>
               <p>MR. HUNGERFORD. I live in Newton-terrace, Kennington, and am a tide-surveyor of the Customs. On the 4th of August I was on board the vessel, and heard that Mr. Briggs had lost his property; some hints were thrown out that the Custom-house officers or searchers, had taken them - I said, "If you suspect any of them, let me know, and I will represent it to the Board of Customs;" he said,"Indeed, I may blame myself a great deal" - I said, "If you suspect any of my officers, let me have their names, and I will not let them go on duty;" I advised the prosecutor to go to the office, and the prisoner offered to go for him: I asked him if he suspected the prisoner - he said he did not; when it was said that a person had been jingling dollars in the cabin, Fell said it was not Martin, if it had been him he should have known him.</p>

On the 6th of February there were two sashes taken from the front parlour, and two from the back - I had seen them safe the evening before, and missed them at nine o'clock in the morning; I had opened the house the evening before, and put the other keys in the front parlour, and took the parlour and street door keys away - when I went in the morning the parlour door was open, and the sash frames gone; the officer showed me the frames the next day - I compared them with the window places; they fitted exactly, and I have no doubt they belonged there - two locks, which had been taken off, were fitted to their places.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were not the sashes burnt? A. Yes, a little; but the tops and bottoms fitted exactly - there was sufficient left to fit in; it was not a common size - they had but six squares, and there were eight squares in the sashes of the other houses in that street - all frames, having the same number of squares, are not of the same size; I had seen them hundreds of times - a man named Bailey was transported for this very offence; I distinctly swear that I saw the frames the same day as I missed them.</p>

            . One morning in February last, about seven o'clock, I saw a man opposite my door, in Parsey's-gardens, which is less than a quarter of a mile from where they were taken - he had two sashes, which laid up against the wall; I do not know who he was - in about a second I saw the prisoner going into a house in North-street with two sashes; I went on to my place of work, and saw the man I had first seen go into the same place as the prisoner did - it was the day the other man was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you seen the prisoner before? A. Yes, and knew him - he was just at the door, but I saw him quite sufficiently to know him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 30th of July I was standing at the corner of Worship-street, Norton Falgate - I saw the prisoner go into a public-house, and he saw me, I suppose; I had been in search of him for some time - I waited a few minutes, and then went and looked in at the window; he was not there - I then saw him come out of a court and crossed towards him; he ran up Worship-street - I saw it was of no use to run after him, and turned up another street, which brought me into the Curtain-road - I saw the prisoner again; he saw me, and ran into a dust yard, which had no thoroughfare - I looked up a hole over some breeze and saw the prisoner's legs; I said, "George, come down" - he said, "Keys, I will come to you" - I said, I took him for some sashes, for which Bailey had been tried; he said, "It is all right, I don't care for that" - as we were going to the office he said,"Cannot you settle it with me; I have 14s. in my pocket which I will give you, if you will let me go?" I said, "That is not the way I do my business; keep the money, you will want it" - I knew of no other charge against him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had you been walking with Mary Allen? A. It might be about two hours - we had one pot of beer to drink - I had been paying some bills, and might have taken a glass of porter before; I will not swear I had not taken any spirits - I was quite sober - the house has not a very respectable appearance; I had been asleep perhaps two hours and a half before Jones came - she did not come to the door, and ask for a light - when she came, I thought it was Allen -I had known Allen for two years; my watch was found in a pair of bellows, in another room - I missed it before the light was brought up; I was certain it was gone, for I had had it in my hand just before - there were no other persons but Allen and myself in the house - there is only one room in it - the watch was found at No. 6, another house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the light came, you saw the watch was gone from the mantel-piece? A. Yes, but I had missed it before - a little light came from the window - it was beginning to be day-light; I had light enough to see the prisoner's person before the candle came - I am certain she is the person who came up, before she brought the light, both by her appearance and her voice.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I went with the witness to No. 2, Providence-place, where he said he had been robbed - I could get no admittance; but having seen a woman come out, and go to No. 6, I followed her -I got in at the window, and the constable found this watch in the bellows in the first-floor room; I found the prisoner in the same room, and took her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time did you go there? A. Twenty minutes after three o'clock - I suppose the prosesecutor had not been with me above five minutes before I went there - I had to get a light, which occasioned me to stop a few minutes - it is a bad place - some of the houses are open the greater part of the night; Mrs. Fulmer is the landlady of that house.</p>

On the 24th of August I met the prisoner in the New-road, between twelve and one o'clock in the day; he first spoke to me about the weather, and then asked if I would have something to drink - I said No, several times, but at last said Yes; I had never seen him before - I walked with him for about half an hour, and then went to my uncle's, in Gloucester-place; he waited for me at the end of Gloucester-place - I went to see my uncle, but he was out of town; I sat talking with the housekeeper nearly three-quarters of an hour, not thinking he would wait so long, but when I came out he was where I left him - he took me into a public-house, No. 75, <placeName id="t18290910-237-crimeloc1307">Norton-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you in any way of business? A. No - I have been with my father; I have not been to service or any business - I was with Mrs. Hart on liking, for two or three days, but the place was too hard, and I left her, finding my health declining; it was between twelve and one o'clock when I met the prisoner in the New-road - I was conversing with him for half an hour or an hour, before I went to my uncle's; I did not make any appointment with him, he said he would wait - I then met him at the corner of Gloucester-place; we went to the Little Cannon in Norton-street - I was not in the Goat and Compasses at the corner of Fitzroy-street, I am quite sure of that; it was between one and two o'clock - we had the beef-steak at the Little Cannon; I think he had a pint of ale afterwards - he might have had three pints in all; I did partake of it before he went away he had a glass of gin and water; I had some of that - he had a pint of beer; I had some of that - he put his arm round my waist after that; he had not done any thing to me before - people kept coming in; no fondling had taken place between us, or any thing of the kind - I do not say he did not kiss me; it was only once - that was early in our sitting; it was not all the time we were there - he paid for what was had; he did not make me any present - my watch was gold, but the chain was not gold; my father is in prison through a person he had been a great friend to - the lights had been lighted an hour before the prisoner went away; the room was not a dark one - I did not see which way he went; I showed the tape to him at the barracks, he took it from me and it fell on the floor - he said, "I have no knife, and how could I cut it;" I did not feel it done, but it was very easy for him to break it - I told the quarter-master my name was Parlett, and I was residing at a friend's; I did not tell him my name was Parker, and that I lived in Britannia-row - I was quite sober, upon my oath; the pot-boy did not conduct me to any place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the kiss given? A. About an hour and a half before he left; no one was in the room at the time - I do not know whether the light was gas or not; I mentioned to the landlady that my watch was gone.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see one of your potboys conduct her to the water-closet? A. No; I thought the prisoner belonged to the first or second regiment of Life Guards, and went with her to the Regent's barracks the same night - when I went into the parlour she was sitting close by the prisoner on the bench; the lights were not lighted more than twenty minutes before they went - the witness was not drunk; she was the worse for liquor.</p>

             re-examined. I did not sleep in the Fleet Prison the night before; I was at a friend's, No. 8, Halton-street; I am sure I had the watch when I got up, and fastened it with the tape as usual; I had looked at it in the day - the reason I said I would defy any man to take it from me was, because I did not know what character he was, and I thought it would deter him - my friend is not here at whose house I slept.</p>

            . I lived at the Goat and Compasses. On the 24th of August I served the prosecutrix, and a soldier who was with her, with two pints of ale; I cannot swear the prisoner is the person - the man had a red coat on; I have no doubt of the prosecutrix's person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time was it? A. Half-past twelve o'clock when they came, they left at half-past one - the house is at the corner of Fitzroy-street; I saw something about this in the newspaper, but had no idea I should be wanted; I had a subpoena last Wednesday - I had no conversation with the prosecutrix; she was in the back room - she had a white shawl on with a narrow border, and a white bonnet with coloured ribbons; I observed her face - my master and his two nieces live there; I served them with what they had.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 17th of July I sent a sample of yellow soap and mottled, to Mrs. Marshall, by the prisoner; he brought word that it was approved of, and she would have half a hundred weight of it on Tuesday - he did not pay me for any soap delivered to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Has he not, on other occasions, brought you money? A. Yes; I was not aware of any goods being sent out that day to any customers; there might be, but it was by my husband's orders - I had not given the prisoner general orders to take out goods; we have a book, in which we keep entries of the sales, but Mrs. Marshall never had credit in her life - I do not enter money received; I have often received money of the prisoner, but have accounted to my husband for it - I have not received money of the prisoner several days after, for ready money transactions - he was taken on the Saturday.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's-shop. I received half a hundred weight of soap by the prisoner, on the 17th of July, for which I paid him, and said I would have another half hundred weight the following week, but I did not name any day; this is the bill and receipt.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose writing is this? A. The bottom part is the prisoner's; I have received bills before, but I do not know who wrote them; I have not particularly examined how the month was put - I know this delivery was on the 17th of July, and I remarked at the time that I could scarcely tell whether the month on the bill was June or July; I have dealt with Mr. Holdsworth for some time - I did receive the second half hundred weight of soap, but not from the prisoner.</p>

             re-examined. On the 17th of July the prisoner took a sample of soap to Mrs. Marshall's, and brought word back that she would have half a hundred weight on the Tuesday, but on the Saturday he was taken on another charge, and on the Thursday my husband called and asked when Mrs. Marshall would have the half hundred weight of soap, as he had not had an opportunity of sending it before, and she said, "I had one half hundred weight and paid for it - has not your lad given you the money?"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Whose hand-writing is this bill? A. The prisoner's; he made out bills of parcels sometimes - I have entrusted him to do it, but I have looked over him - he has received monies when I have receipted a bill and sent it out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the order from Mrs. Marshall, and took the soap from my master's shop by my mistress' knowledge, and brought back the money - my mistress was very busy at tea with her sister.</p>

On the 14th of July, at three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in company with two others with a bundle, in Collingwood-street; I pursued them - they made their escape to Northampton-street; I came back, and examined a yard where I had a glimpse of the bundle going over, and found the plucks -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100124"/>I know the prisoner, but he had not the bundle; I did not see the cart.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. About March last, I was about to purchase a piece of furniture; Mrs. Baker told me she did not know a cheaper place than Oxenden's rooms in Oxford-street - I said I was not aware that any articles of value were sold there; she said Mr. Provis bought the furniture there which belonged to him - and Thompson observed, that very good articles were sometimes to be got there as bargains, but that entirely depended upon the attendance or non-attendance of Jew brokers - the furniture was removed from No. 37, George-street in June or July; I understood, she spoke generally of the furniture of the house - I did not understand it meant all the furniture of the house; I knew she bought some herself - after the furniture was removed, I assisted in apprehending the male prisoner; he begged and entreated to be let go - I would not, and he ran away; he was taken to the watch-house, and produced a receipt for the furniture, having purchased it of the other prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Then your only occupation is not that of a surgeon, you take thieves? A. I give them to the officer - I cannot tell of any one article of furniture which she had purchased: I only knew by what she said to me that she had purchased some - I attended her when she was ill; I had no hostile feeling towards either of the prisoners - I had some legal proceedings with Baker for my expences as a surgeon; I do not exactly know the amount of my bill - the debt stands as it did; I knew Thompson to be the person against whom the warrant was issued - I saw him in the street, and apprehended him; I never did such a thing in my life before - I live at No. 17, Carmarthen-street; I do not know that Baker had ever sold these goods as her own - I do not know her hand-writing.</p>
               <p>MR. DUNN. Q. Is Mr. Provis a friend of yours? A. Yes, I have known him some time - I saw one load of the furniture handed out of the passage of the house to the carman; I endeavoured to find Mr. Provis' address - I was three days finding it out, and before I could write he came to town.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you attend the first examination? A. Yes; I saw Thompson at Marlborough-street, and asked him if he would pay me my wages - he told me he had no money, and could not pay me; I gave evidence after that, but I should have done so if he had paid me - I did not know Baker was in difficulty; I knew there was to be an execution in the house - I did not know the goods were removed to avoid the execution; I was present when the Sheriffs' officer came - I do not know when it was; I did not leave the house till the goods were removed - the surgeons did attend me; I think the goods were removed the same week that the Sheriffs' officer came - I think it was within two days; I know they were removed to avoid the execution.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Why do you know it? A. The officer told me so - he did not call himself a Sheriffs' officer; he asked for Mrs. Baker - that is all I know; I do not know what he was, and Thompson did not say.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Upon your oath did not this gentleman come to the house and produce his warrant to seize? A. I do not know; he offered me a paper, but I did not know what it was - I did not know the man.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Were your wages paid when you left the house? A. No; I did not see Thompson till he was in custody - I did not propose that if he would pay me I would not give evidence; some proposals have been made to me by Mr. Wallis, who is not here.</p>

            . I am a carter; I know Thompson. In June last my master, Mr. Skinner, sent me to No. 36, George-street, to remove some things - I went in the morning, between ten and eleven o'clock, and twice afterwards in the day; I saw Thompson, the servant, and an elderly woman - I took the goods, which consisted of chairs, tables, and other things, to a coffee-shop at the corner of Grafton-street; Mr. Thompson sent me on, and followed the cart - when I got to the corner of Grafton-street I put the things down by the railings: another cart came and took some of them - Thompson was present at the time; I took a large table to Mr. Chapman's, a pawnbroker, by Thompson's order - he said it was paid for; I removed two other loads in the course of the day - Thompson was present, I acted under his orders - he told me he was going to take them to a sale the next morning; he did not say whose they were.</p>

            . I am master of the carman who has been examined. Thompson came to me, and I sent my man: he came for him again, and I sent him again; in about a fortnight I was going down George-street - he came and said he wanted a cart, could he have it; I said Yes - I drew up to the house, and took out a bedstead; Baker was in the kitchen, helping us up with it; I did not wait, but sent for my man, who took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you hear of any execution against the goods? A. I heard nothing at all, but by seeing the cart loaded in such a bustle, I thought there was something very queer in it.</p>
               <p>MR. PROVIS re-examined. I went to Mr. Davies, and saw some property, which was mine; I had let it in the house to the female prisoner - I saw the table shown by Mr. Chapman; that was a part of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there a coffee-biggin? A. No; I found nothing portable; there were two large tables and a chest of drawers - I know the woman has bought goods, and put them in the house; I do not know whether she bought a chest of drawers or a deal table, but the table I saw was my own - I do not know whether she was in any difficulty; I never saw her from the 7th of February till she was in custody: all I know about the man, is that he was a lodger in the house - the lodging was furnished, and was let to him by the other prisoner; he might take her for the owner of the house.</p>
               <p>MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Have you yourself had any conversation with him, as to who was the owner? A. No - the property she bought was bought with my money partly, which I owed for wages; I think it was legally hers but morally mine; I was to allow it her in the rent.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know of any execution? A. No- I have heard of such a thing since I have been in town, but I know nothing of it.</p>

            . I am an officer of the Sheriff of Middlesex. I had this warrant in my possession; before I received it I had this warrant in my possession; before I received it I had been to No. 36, George-street, for the purpose of arresting Thompson. I saw this servant, and told her my object; I saw Baker, and told her the same: this warrant is dated the 28th of July - I went to execute it two or three times, but the house was closed; when I went there first the house was fall of goods, but when I entered with the warrant there were no goods on the premises; I endeavoured to follow them, but could not find them - the warrant is against William Thompson and Ann Baker - if I had found any goods I should have seized them, and sold them; I remember being in the Court of King's Bench; I arrested Thompson, and he offered Baker as bail to me - she offered to become bail for the man: I asked if she was a responsible person, and could pay the money, if he should fix her, and she said Yes, her furniture in her house in George-street would pay it.</p>

            . I am a general-dealer in saddles and harness. On Friday week a message was left for me to go and look at a saddle at No. 9, Hart-street - I met Webster, and said "I am going to look at a saddle, there was one lost out of the park, perhaps it is it;" I went there and asked the man in the shop if there was not a man who had a saddle to sell, he said go to the first-floor- I went up, and the woman said "My husband is gone out and has got the saddle;" I went back to my house and heard that it had been there - I went to the Duke of Wellington public-house, and saw Serjer, and another man who had the saddle; Serjer said, "It does not belong to me, it balongs to a man named Smith - I want 36s. for it;" I told Webster.</p>

On the 4th of September I went and saw Serjer with the saddle - he said he bought it of a man named Smith, but he did not know where to find him; I took him - he was examined the next day; some of his friends looked out for Smith, and said he was at a public-house - I went and said, "Is your name Smith?" he said "Yes - I gave the saddle to Serjer, and I received it from Simpkins;" I took him to the office - Simpkins said he was the person who applied for it under false pretences.</p>

               <p>Q. When you first went into the room with the woman, did she bolt the door? A.

I desired him to do me no bodily harm -I am not certain that I used the word bodily; I said this in consequence of his using these threatening expressions, and from his manner - I was very much frightened at the time at his manner and his words - he then nailed the window with a hammer and nails; it was a sliding window - he had a hammer and nail there; he then said if I made any resistance he would call those to his assistance who would use me ten times worse than he would, and that he could have plenty to his assistance; he said he would call his brother to his assistance, who would use me worse than he would, or could - the woman at this time was sitting at the foot of the bed; he went to the cupboard which he had come out of, and wetted a knife - I did not see the knife, but it had the sound of a knife; this alarmed me very much - there was no light in the room; it was daylight at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. When he was nailing the window down, or during the time all this was going on, did he threaten you at all? A. He threatened me very much, by saying several times that he would use me ill by calling his brothers to me - he said that several times; he asked me if I could give him money - I told him I dare say I could get a friend; in fact, he asked me, when he found I had very little about me, if I could get a friend to advance me some -I had a watch in my possession; during the time I was in bed, it was in my hat, which was close by the bedside; on the chair; I dressed myself before any thing was said about the watch - when I was dressed, he said,"Leave your watch."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that in a threatening manner? A. He did; I told him I valued the watch very much, but it would not be of much value to him, that he had better take what money I had and let me go; he did not take my money - I took the money in my hand and offered him - it was only 3s.; he said it was only 3s., and refused it; he made another request for my watch, and said if I did not give it up he should take other means to make me, or he should call his brothers, who would soon set me to rights, or something to that effect; I gave the watch up to him through fear from those threatenings: I had taken it from my hat and put it into my pocket; I took it from my fob, and gave it to him with my hand, through fear.</p>

               <p>Q. You gave it out of fear from this threatening language; his whetting the knife, nailing down the window, and saying he would call his brother, who would use you worse, is that true, on your oath? A. That is true - when he first appeared at the foot of the bed I do not think he asked if I had any money; he unlocked the door and let me out; the woman was a perfect stranger to me; I had made no bargain to give her any money, but I gave her, I think, 2s. in the room; I had no intention of stopping all night; I went and gave information directly; the prisoner is the man - he was taken up in about an hour, and my watch found on him; I parted with it in consequence of fear.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you give the watch into my hand? A. I did; I did not first offer to send the watch to pledge, nor offer you 50l. not to expose me to the public.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I not tell you to be cautions under what circumstances you gave me your watch, as you valued it? A. You told me, provided I would return at ten o'clock with a sovereign, you would return me the watch; I did not authorize him to pledge it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the terms you gave me the watch for? A. Through fear; I was not treated with hospitality in the room; I was treated most shamefully - you did produce to me a paper which you said was the certificate of your marriage; he took it from a box, and said it was the certificate of his marriage.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came to my house a little after six o'clock on Friday morning, and informed me he had been robbed of his watch - I went to the house he pointed out in Chequer-alley, and went up two pairs of stairs - he gave the account he has now; he was in a very agitated state; I went up stairs to the room; the prosecutor was with me - the room was locked, and nobody in it; I obtained a key of the landlord, who lives but a few doors off - and while I was in the room searching for the property, I heard footsteps on the stairs, and the prisoner made his appearance; the prosecutor said,"That is the man who has robbed me;" I laid hold of him, and he immediately produced the watch from his pocket with a view to give it to the prosecutor; he presented it to the prosecutor as I caught hold of him, but I prevented his giving it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100129"/>Prisoner. Q. Did you not ask me when I entered the room where the man's watch was? A. You did not give me the opportunity - you pulled the watch out of your pocket before I could hardly get hold of you; the moment you showed your face on the top of the stairs, the prosecutor said "This is the man that robbed me;" the prisoner heard that, and it was after that he gave up the watch; I received it and took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 24th of July, I came home about a quarter to one o'clock, and on my arrival, found the door open; the prosecutor swore it was locked and bolted at the office - I went in - this man started from the bed; I asked who he was, and what he did on my premises - he said he was seduced there by the woman; I said it was impossible, and that the woman was my wife - he said that could not be; I said it was so - he begged for mercy; and asked if I would permit him to put on his clothes - I said I would, provided he had no injurious implement about him - he asked if I would search him; I said No, I would take his word, and he dressed, placed himself in a chair, appeared very agitated, and crying out about his woman and child - he pulled from his pocket a small parcel containing a child's frock or pelisse, and said he would give me 50l. not to expose him, as he would lose his situation, and offend his wife; I staid in the room some time, then undrew the curtain - my wife placed herself near the window, and having occasion to go down stairs, I took a small brad and nail to fasten the window, which was a little open when I entered the room; I went to the cupboard to strike a light with a flint and steel, to light the fire, and the prosecutor represents that as a knife - I went down stairs, came up again in five minutes, and found him, and the woman both by the window, he blaming her for bringing him there; I then considered he had been seduced there - he begged of me to let him go; pulling a small sum of money from his pocket, asking if that and his watch would do - he asked me to pledge the watch, and asked if he could place confidence in me, and leave his watch with me till he returned; I asked what he was going away for - he said he wanted to speak to a friend; I said I was determined to look into this - he then pulled his watch from his pocket; I believe it had before been in his hat - he laid it on the table, and asked me again if he could place confidence in me, and leave it with me- seeing he had been led into an error, I said I had no objection to take care of it till he returned; he was going away - I told him to be cautious, as the neighbourhood was a bad one; I gave him a card, he wrote my address on it with pencil, and went away - he was to come to me at twelve o'clock; I went out, walked about for ten minutes, and on returning, the female was gone - I took the watch from the box, put it into my fob, and walked about looking for the female; I could not find her, and on coming back, found Brown in the room - as I entered, the prosecutor said, "This is the man;" Brown asked me"Where is the man's watch" - "Here she is" said I, pulling her out of my pocket; the prosecutor seemed inclined to take it, but Brown pulled it out of my hand. I hope you will take it into your serious consideration, and treat me with impartiality.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Is it true that you gave him the watch to prevent his exposing you to your wife? A. I can only say I gave it him, through fear, and from no other account whatever; I did not say any thing to him about hoping he would not expose me or tell where I had been - how could I expect he would see my wife, when he did not know me; there is not a word of truth in what he has said.</p>

            . I am assistant to the receiver general of the Customs, and was so in April last; these two documents (looking at them) were produced to me on the 18th of April by a person who was rather short - I think the person was very much like the short prisoner(Maynuard); I am unable to identify him - I saw him for a very short time; I think the resemblance strong, but cannot identify him - on the documents being put into my hand, there was something in the receipt, that struck me, a little remarkable; it appeared something like a schoolboy's writing - I communicated with the corresponding clerk, and being satisfied the document was genuine, I marked it for payment, with my initials and the date, the 18th of April - the course of business, after I had marked it, would be for the individual presenting it to me, to present it at the Treasury for payment, which, I believe, was the case - for Croxford, the clerk of the Treasury, not having cash to meet it, came to me for a cheque on the Bank, to pay it with; (looking at the cheque) this is the cheque I gave him for it - this receipt was annexed to the document, and purports to be signed by the comptroller of the Customs; when I pay a warrant of this sort, I do not ask the name of the person receiving it, or for whom it is received - that is Croxford's duty; I have been in the Custom-house upwards of thirty-four years - these two documents are filled up perfectly regular and correct in all parts.</p>

               <p>Q. Are both these documents the work of one office or would they pass through two offices? A. That would emanate from the Secretary's department; I know of no order given at the Bank respecting the payment of cheques for the Customs - (looking at a 5l. note) after this fraud had been committed, I traced a 5l. note; I believe this is it, by the name of Maynard at the back of it, but I have put no mark on it - I obtained that note from the Bank of England; I think, on the 7th of May I went to Lees', the banker's in Lombard-street, from there to Ruden and Co's., Salvador-house, Bishopsgate-street - I finally traced it to a baker, of the name of Bristow; I have no doubt this is the note delivered to me, in consequence of this notice from the Bank, which is attached to it - I had no other 5l. note at that time; it was cancelled when I got it from the Bank - I had no other cancelled note. After this fraud was discovered, placards were stock in the lobby of the Custom-house; here is one which I took down from the officer - the 5l. note, No. 5068, is the last of the series mentioned here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You think one of the prisoners is like the person, but you do not swear which? A. Certainly not; if I had met him in the street or play-house, I think I might have passed him without noticing him - the name of Maynard on the note is not my writing; I identify it, by that name being on it when I received it cancelled from the Bank - I never had it before.</p>

             - from the appearance of the prisoner Maynard, I believe him to be the man who presented it; I had not sufficient money to pay it, and went to Mr. Beaumont and asked him for a draft on the Bank of England - he gave me this draft, to the best of my recollection (looking at it) - I gave it to Maynard; it was necessary that he should take the draft to the Comptroller-general, to be countersigned by him before it would be paid at the Bank - I do not think that I told him that was necessary.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had you any previous acquaintance with the person you call Maynard? A. Not to my knowledge; I see a great many persons in the course of business - when I saw Maynard again, he was in custody and pointed out to me as the man charged with this offence: I had not seen him from the day he presented it, till he was in custody - I do not swear positively to him, but I believe him to be the man.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Comptroller-general's office at the Custom-house. On the 18th of April, I recollect this warrant for 1973l. being brought in (looking at it) - it was presented to Mr. Mure in my presence; it was necessary for him to make an entry of it, in a book- while he was so doing, I observed the person who brought it, sitting on a box near me; the prisoner, Maynard, very much resembles that person - to the best of my belief, he is the person; I had an opportunity of seeing him for a quarter of an hour; I should think - the prisoner Jones, is in the same office as myself; the green book is kept in the Secretary's office - whether he had access to it, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Can you take on yourself to say the person was there a quarter of an hour? A. I am confident it was near a quarter of an hour; Mr. Mure had to examine the document to see if it was correct, and make an entry of it; he had not got to copy it - he did not remain longer than while Mr. Mure was so engaged: all the time he was in the office Mr. Mure was engaged writing - there is a railing round the first clerk's desk, but Mr. Mure's desk is not enclosed by any partition; I was sitting opposite Mr. Mure - there was no railing to prevent my seeing him; I was engaged reading and examining debentures, which Mr. Mure was ticking off, prior to the person coming with the document - we both left off instantly: I did not see Maynard again for about four months - he was then in custody on this charge.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. When the person entered, you left off reading the debentures - were you employed doing any thing else, or had you an opportunity of observing the person? A. I had an opportunity of observing him, because I could not go on without Mure.</p>

            . I am assistant comptroller. I have been in the office since last December; before that I was inspector of out-port collectors' accounts - if an outport collector has occasion for money, the practice at that time was either to apply to the Board, or to make a statement to the comptroller-general of his account; if it is found he is in want of money, an entry is made in this green book (producing it) by a clerk in the office - it is called the receiver-general's interest book: the clerk enters it, and then brings it to the chief clerk to put his initials - the book is then taken to the Secretary's office; what passes there I do not know - the prisoner Jones was a clerk in the Comptroller's office; I found him there when I came in December - his salary was 90l. a year; the hours of attendance are from ten till four - he had a specific duty, which was to enter the reports of the principal of the department; that required his attendance daily, except on holidays - I sat in another room, and therefore had not constant inspection of him, to see whether he was there every day; when an order is made on the Bank for the payment of money by the receiver-general, it is countersigned by myself and the chief clerk, by power of attorney from the Comptroller-general; it is countersigned before it is taken out; Jones had been in the office some years, as I understand, and would be acquainted with the forms of the office - this order on the Bank has my signature to it; I have no recollection of the person who brought it to be signed - the green book is kept usually in the Secretary's office, I believe; I expect that the clerks in both offices had access to it; one of the clerks going to the office, and inquiring for it, would of course have it - it is not locked up during office hours.</p>

             NAISH. I am a clerk in the Bank of England. This cheque (looking at it) was presented there for payment on the 18th of April; I gave two tickets on different offices for the payment of it, and have them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100132"/>here - one is on the Pay-clerks office for 1970l. in notes, and the other for 3l. on the In-teller's office; I saw the person who presented it, but do not recollect what passed - the person must have said he would take it short or in notes, or I should not have given the ticket on the pay-clerks for the sum; I took notice of the person presenting it - he was of a middle stature, and shabbily dressed; from Maynard's height and age, I should say he hears some resemblance.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Bank. This ticket, marked A., was presented to me on the 18th of April by a person of middle stature, and dressed in a brown coat, as well as I can remember, and there was asecond person accompanying him; the prisoner Maynard resembles the party who presented this ticket to me; I have no recollection of the other - I asked the person presenting it how he wished it to be paid; he said (looking at a book) he would have two 500l., nine 100l., one 50l., and four 5l. Bank notes; I paid him those notes - this book contains the entry, here is a book containing the number of the notes; the 500l. were Nos. 2536 and 2537, dated the 6th of April, 1829 - nine of 100l., Nos. 19,417 to 19,425, both inclusive, dated the 11th of April - one of 50l., No. 16,63, dated the 21st of March - four of 5l., Nos. 5865 to 5868, dated the 9th of March (looking at a 100l. note, number 19,495) - I have no doubt of this being one of them; and this 5l. note, number 5868, is also one.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any recollection of the person who presented the ticket? A. I have some slight recollection of the party; the prisoner Maynard resembles the person who presented it - the other was dressed in a blue coat, but I did not notice him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Does it distinctly appear in your book that the numbers are inclusive? A. They are; if you count the numbers you will find it must be so, and they are all marked off in my book; I paid him new notes with no names on them; there are now several names on this note as if it had passed through several hands - it is quite in a different state as to the names on it; it appears as if there had been some writing on the face also.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. There were no such names on it when it left the Bank? A. No; I cannot tell who put them on.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the Secretary's office in the Custom-house. I have known Jones rather more than three years; when he first came into the Custom-house he was in the Secretary's department, and was then removed to the Comptroller's; I know he was in difficulties in the year 1828, for I was applied to by a relative to settle his private affairs; I communicated with Jones, and found he was in difficulties - the amount I paid for him was about 100l.; it was an arrangement with his creditors - they had 20s. in the pound; I got part of it from a relative, and deducted part from his own salary; I saw him in June last, when he told me his wife had 700l., and a piano left by a relative of his wife's, residing in Newgate-street or the Old Bailey, I do not know which - I advised him to invest it; I have seen the warrant and receipt - in the way they are got, I should say it was certainly necessary for the person to be acquainted with the method of business in the Secretary and Comptrollers' offices.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long before the 27th of April was it you advised him to invest the money? A. It was about the 9th or 10th of June this year; I had been intimate with him about three years - his difficulties were finally settled in February, 1829; that was the last payment I made - the money was advanced him by a gentleman moving in a respectable sphere of life, and of some opulence.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Would the gentleman that advanced the money allow it to pass through his own hands, or did he give it to you? A. He gave it to me - he had no communication with the prisoner himself.</p>

            . I am in the service of Mr. Hamlin, jeweller, of Princes-street, Coventry-street. On the 10th of August I remember the prisoner Jones coming to purchase some jewellery - I think it was near eleven o'clock; he was dressed in a frock-coat - I do not recollect the colour; he had mustachios, which he has not now- he asked to see some necklaces, which I showed him; they were too expensive for him; he then asked to see some ear-rings and lockets, which were shown him - he agreed to purchase jewellery to the amount of 6l. 14s., and tendered me a 100l. note in payment; I called Mr. Bull, the clerk - he gave it to him; I have no doubt of his being the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see any note yourself? A. I did, and should know it again;(looking at it), this is it - here are a number of names which were all on it at the time, except one, which he wrote himself; I think three different names were on it when he gave it to me, to the best of my recollection; the note is in the same situation as when he gave it me, except his own name being on it.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. What name did he put on it? A.

               <p>JAMES BULL. I am a servant to Mr. Hamlin. I remember this note being given to me to change; the prisoner Jones is the person, I am certain - when it was handed to me I requested him to put his name on the back of it, for I was not satisfied about the note, as well as his appearance; I sent it to the banker's for change - the prisoner walked about the shop while it was gone to the banker's; he walked out, walked in again, and asked for the change - I told him we had not received it, and I had sent to the banker's for it; he said he could not wait for the change, he would write a letter for it - we afterwards sent the note to the Bank; I saw the prisoner write this name on it - I am sure this is the note; I got information from the Bank that it had been stopped - I was out with Salmon looking for him two or three times; we found him in Hadlow-street, Brunswick-square, near Judd-street - I knew him immediately, and laid hold of him; he was dressed very different to when he came to our house - he had a blue coat, buff-waistcoat, gilt buttons, black handkerchief, and had a new silk umbrella in his hand; at our shop he had an old blue coat, much worn, an eye-glass, and a cotton umbrella - he had a pair of mustachios, which he had not got when he was taken up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. On what day did you sell him the jewellery? A. On the 10th of August - Salmon took him two or three days afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you address him by any name? A. Yes - I said, "Mr. Arrowsmith, you have not got your mustachios on, how is that?"</p>

            . I keep the Blackmoor's Head in Whitcomb-street. I saw the prisoner Jones at my house on Monday, I think the 10th of August - he came and called for a glass of ale, a sheet of paper, and a pen and ink; he wrote a note, turned to the bar, and asked for a wafer, which I gave him - he went out, returned again, and asked if I could find a person to take a note for him; I got him a man, named Ferguson - he gave a note to Ferguson, and went out at the time Ferguson did; he told him, in my presence, to take the note as directed, to obtain a parcel, and carry it for Mr. Arrowsmith to the Bull and Mouth, Regent-circus, Piccadilly - he was to inquire for a Mr. Arrowsmith, and if he was there to give him the parcel; he came back in about ten minutes - Ferguson had not returned; he told me he would send a Temple porter to my house for the parcel, and I was to take care of it till the Temple porter came for it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who is the man that did all this? A. The prisoner Jones; I have no doubt he is the man - I certainly did doubt at first; I named another person at Bow-street as the man, but I had not seen Jones then - I recalled it almost directly.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Was not Jones at that time in the office, as conspicuous as any other? A. He was; I did point another man out - I was on my oath at that time; I cannot recollect, but I think some one did tell me to look round again - I have no doubt of it; my attention was directed to the part of the room Jones was in - I selected Jones the moment I saw the man I pointed to - no person pointed to him; I think I was directed to the part of the room he stood in - he was about two yards from me; the man, I first pointed out, was about the same distance - I thought the other man resembled the features at the moment I looked round; I had not then seen Jones - I certainly thought he was the man.</p>

               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. It turned out you were mistaken? A. I was; I was agitated in giving evidence- I am sure the man told Ferguson he must go for a parcel to Hamlin's, and he said he was to bring it to the Temple; he had no mustachios on when he wrote the note.</p>

            .

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You did not know the person before? A. No; when I saw him again he was in custody - Cox was at Bow-street with me; he spoke to the man before I did - I saw him point to a man, but which man it was I do not know; I went into the office, Jones looked round at me directly - Cox had sworn to him before I did; I should not have sworn to him without being positive - I had only seen him once before, but that was for a long time; he wrote the letter in the room - I saw him at Bow-street on the Friday week following; I do not think Cox saw him so long as I did - he was talking to him when he called me to take the letter.</p>

               <p>"I cannot think of fetching it without you give me a note for it;" we went into the Coach and Horses, near the New Church, in the Strand - he wrote a note there in my presence, and put the name of Arrowsmith at the bottom of it; we went out together - when we got to St. Martin's Church he said,"Bedwin, I don't wish you to leave this note;" I said,"What is to indemnify me or the landlord, Mr. Jones; I hope you are not going to bring me into a scrape about this parcel? for I was never brought to justice in my life for any thing;" I went on with him - he went within four or five yards of the house with me, and pointed out to me the Blackmoor's Head, in Whitcomb street - I gave the note to the landlord, but did not get the parcel; I went back to Jones and told him the parcel was not come, that the publican had sent to Mr. Hamlin for it, they said the man who packed it up was not in the way, and they did not know when he might be - Jones told me to stop for the parcel, (and gave me 6d. to get some drink with) and take it to the Bull and Mouth, Regent-circus - this passed in Whitcomb-street, where he had been waiting for me; I went back to the public-house - the landlord spoke to me, and seeing the name of Arrowsmith - I did not stop, but went home; I saw no more of Jones - (note read).</p>

Bank notes, and sixty-nine sovereigns; part of the sovereigns were given to his solicitor, and some he has had himself - I found a watch on him, which I gave up to him, but I took this seal off, as it exactly fits the impression on the seal of this letter (No. 2.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Where is your warehouse? A. I have none, nor any shop - I have not dealt in ironmongery lately, not for about a twelve month; I have bought and sold 4000l. or 5000l. worth within this fifteen years; I was a black ironmonger, and was never in business in London; I had a shop at Coventry, in 1815, since which I have been staying in London - I have been a hired servant - I have had no establishment in the ironmongery trade since 1815; I now live in Green-street, Blackfriar's-road, which is in the rules of the Bench, but I am not a ruler - I never in my life was bail for any person at Westminster. nor at Serjeant's Inn - I have been bail to the Sheriff; I have never been bail at Westminster unless once or twice, perhaps, I have put in bail for remnant; I never justified, nor attempted to do so - I have been in the employ of Mr. Turk, at Lambeth, then in Frith-street, Soho, and at Sturch and Co's., where I was two years - that is eleven or twelve years ago; I left him through illness - there was no imputation against me, that I know of - I was never bail at Union Hall; I once bailed a person at Bow-street, seven or eight years ago; I was then selling goods on commission - I know the Globe public-house, Borough-road, and know the landlord - I have not been in the habit of getting bail, or receiving money for doing it - I have when I have been bail - I have asked friends to go to bail; I have been paid my expences for that, but received no fee - nothing more than I considered my expences; I have done that perhaps half a dozen times - I cannot tell to a few times; you may take it at forty in all - I have not been the procurer of bail; I have introduced the parties together, and within fifteen years it may be forty times -I did not give them money to be bail; the defendants themselves did, I dare say, but I do not know it - I did not promise them payment - I know a man they call Mack - I do not know him by any other name; I did not tell him I had been to Bow-street against West, or that if I could swear, so as to convict him, I should get 50l.; I never mentioned such a word; nor that if not, I should have a guinea a day for my trouble - I never thought of such a thing; but that person told me he would go and swear so; he saw it in the newspaper, and came to me next morning, and abused me very much.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever say with an oath that you would swear above a bit? A. No, I never made use of an oath in his presence - I do not swear very often - I never said that if I got the money I should leave the Borough-road; that I was short of blunt, and not particular - I know Mr. Parish, the clerk of the papers, of the King's Bench.</p>
               <p>Q. And if we have him here, you will go on to swear you were never bail for people in the King's Bench? A. Never in my life - I was charged, about fourteen years ago, with not making my accounts correct at a place; there was 3s. 6d. deficient, and when the books were brought forward, it was proved I was innocent and I believe you pleaded for me: it was Mr. Lawford, the ironmonger, made the charge - he was my master - I was acquitted, certainly; I never was in any other disagreeable situatin.</p>
               <p>Q. No Custom-house affair? A. I signed a bond for a relation of mine, and suffered six months in Horsemonger-lane for it, four years ago - I was a housekeeper last in Union-row, Kent-road; that is two years ago - I have not been a housekeeper all the time I have been from Coventry - I sometimes was for two or three years, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>MR. ATTORNEY-GENERAL. Q. Who is Mack? A. A person who has been in the army, and now carries yeast about - he sells Birmingham yeast; I have seen the prisoners and him at Mr. Bailey's public-house several times.</p>

            . My father is a bullion dealer, and lives in Cornhill: we frequently have persons come to the shop with Napoleons for sale (looking at a cheque). On the 24th of August, I served a person who brought three hundred and fifty-nine Napoleons - I gave him a cheque on Smith, Payne, and Smith, for 284l. 4s. 2d.; I cannot speak positively to the person - if it was either of the prisoners it was West, but I cannot say that I believe it was him; the name of Must is put on the cheque, which I have got back as paid; I changed three 100l. notes at the Bank of England, and paid the notes I received for them for foreign coin brought to me by somebody - when we pay notes for foreign coin, we make a point of getting them from the Bank; I most likely paid these notes for bullion, but it might be for other things.</p>

            . I am clerk to Smith and Payne. I paid this cheque, on the 24th of August, in a 200l. bank note and two 40l. (looking at three notes found on the prisoner West) - these are three of the notes I paid.(The warrant and receipt were here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Jones' Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I labour under the infirmity of very considerable deafness, which almost incapacitates me from hearing the details of the proceedings in Court upon this most serious occasion, when every earthly interest is at stake, and even my life is placed in jeopardy; but I leave myself in perfect confidence in the hands of my counsel, being satisfied, as I can confidently and solemnly assert myself innocent of the offence of either forging or uttering the document in question; and that I either directly or indirectly counselled, assisted, or afforded any assistance in the fabrication; that no evidence can be produced to connect me in any way with a transaction of which, in truth, I had no knowledge - I therefore leave my case to the discrimination and humanity of the Court and Jury, satisfied that a verdict against me will not be pronounced upon suspicions that have no foundation, or circumstances which lead to no satisfactory proof of guilt on my part.</p>

            . I keep the Globe, Borough-road. I have known Bushel about two years, and have seen him at my house frequently, as a customer; he has been in the habit of meeting people at my house for the purpose of procuring bail for them - I have heard him say to the people, "What men do you want; we have them from 20l. to 1000l." - I do not know how he was paid for this; I certainly would not believe him on his oath, from what I know of his character.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What reason have you for not believing him on his oath? A. I have heard him, when an observation has been made, say, for so and so he would take an oath to such a thing - I think he is that character, he is not to be taken on his oath; I have heard him state on many trifling things which I knew to be false, that he would make an affidavit of it - he frequented my house, and I knew his affairs pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. How? A. I know he is a good for nothing man, and I think he would take any man's character away for 5s. - that is my reason for not believing him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have heard him say, for so and so he would make an affidavit; what do you mean? A. Why, if a man wanted him to say he was in such a place on such a day, I believe he is the man that would do it; I have heard him say so - I have seen enough of him to know him.</p>

            . I am a dealer in yeast: I have been under government, and have a pension. I know Bushel - I have no malice against him, nor have I quarrelled with him; I had some conversation with him after he had been to Bow-street - he told me if he could swear so as to convict West, he should get 50l. - that if he could not convict him, he should get a guinea a day for his trouble; and he said, "D-n my eyes if I won't swear above a bit; that if he got the money, he would leave the Borough-road to be d-d; that he was short of money, and not particular - this was last Tuesday week; I have known him seven or eight months, and declare I would not believe him on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPPARD. Q. Where was this? A. In the parlour of the house I lodge at; he was a customer, and came at times - he did not come by invitation, not latterly, when I found what he was - he did not say this to me alone; there were other persons in the room - I do not know who they are; I was subpoenaed to come here last Saturday; he said this after he had given his evidence at Bow-street - I lodge at Bailey's public-house; I have seen West and Maynard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100138"/>there two or three times - I do not know that I have seen Maynard there above twice; I never saw them together to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He came into the parlour, and you, being a parlour customer, went in likewise? A. Yes; this conversation was quite voluntary on his part - I sent the next day to tell West of it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Hewit, in the office of the King's Bench prison, and have been there about seventeen years. I have known Bushel at least ten or twelve years - he has been about the place assisting prisoners, and I believe at times getting bail for them; I have not had much opportunity of judging of his character, for I never associated with him - I should not myself consider him a person to be believed on his oath.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Now, why do you come to say you would not believe him on his oath? A. I speak in general terms - I do not mean to say he is not to be believed; I only know him about the prison - I had nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Have you seen him in particular societies, and with particular persons? A. I have seen him almost daily - he seldom or ever goes into the prison; it does not fall within my department to know what he is employed in about there.</p>

               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. For what reason would you not believe him? A. Because he has obtained money from me on several occasions on promises which he never performed, and which I believe at the time he never intended to perform.</p>

               <p>MR. CUMMINGS. This is our handkerchief, and is worth 4s. or 4s. 6d.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you any mark besides the pattern? A. It was the last we had of the pattern, and it was missing - we had sold the pieces; the value of the whole is 6l. or 7l; Fairer was not alone in the shop to my knowledge; he was not employed about the silks; he might get access by taking down the inside shutters which we put up on Sundays and at nights; whether he picked the lock or not I do not know; he has been a whitesmith; the locks are but common ones - he said it was on Sunday afternoon he got them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he say? A. I inquired how he had got access to the shop - he said on Sunday afternoon, and that he had persuaded one of the servants to go away, which she did, contrary to my orders.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not desire that the part not paid should be marked on the bill? A. No; when I went back, I went to the prisoner, and paid him - two ladies came in to look at some crape shawls, after I was served - I do not recollect whether he attended to them before he made my bill out - he took the 3s. to the cashier the moment I gave it him, but the first money he did not take for several minutes; he was looking for a sheet of paper to put the goods in.</p>

            . I am cashier to the prosecutor. On the 12th of August the prisoner brought me this cheque of 7s. 1 1/2d., which he paid me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you been in the service of the prosecutor? A. Fourteen or fifteen months- I am apprentice there - Mr. Hall has complained of errors in my cash accounts; I do not recollect his saying he would turn me away - errors have been made by me, or the shopmen; an explanation has been given afterwards - I quarrelled with the prisoner, and he struck me; but I was not set to watch him particularly - there were a great many people in the shop - I saw two other ladies come in, but I think that was after the ticket came to me; I received the 3s.; I did not see Mr. Phillips present - I did not hand the money over to Mr. Phillips; I believe Mr. Phillips and all the rest were present when the prisoner was charged with this.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has there been any charge against your honesty? A. No, there have been mistakes.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. HALL. Q. I believe you had a good character with the prisoner? A. Yes, for three years - I had engaged him as a foreman, and had the greatest confidence in him till within a few days.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you tell him of this? A. About two hours after it occurred - he denied it altogether, till the lady was brought over, and then he admitted it - the cashier slipped out after the lady, and asked what she had paid; when the lady was brought back, the prisoner admitted it, but did not say how it happened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know he had served other ladies before the charge was made? A. Yes, he served thirty-four customers that day - it was about nine o'clock at night when I spoke to him.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the lady sent for? A. Yes; I had been over to inquire the particulars, and then brought her to the shop - he said, "I admit the lady paid me 1ls. 1 1/2d." he did not say he meant to pay the 4s. at some other time, nor would any young man be allowed to do so - that is my peremptory order.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose he had wanted 4s. for any purpose? A. He should have taken the whole money to the cashier - it does not appear by his book that the other ladies were served - the sums just above and below this are 1s. 10d. and 1s. 4d., and then here is a cheque for 5l. 12s.; the 7s. 1 1/2d. is not in the right place in his book; it is added afterwards.</p>

            . Q. Was the cheque given with the money at the time? A. I believe it was a minute or two after he paid the money.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Has not Mr. Hall entered the amount of your deficiencies to your father both before and after I was in the house? A. Yes - I believe you did say there were 3s. more to pay; I do not recollect that you were attending to any ladies at the time - you have at other times given your money without a cheque, when engaged with a second person - on the Monday night, I entered 1s. 9d. to your name which did not belong to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not left your desk totally unattended to for a quarter of an hour? A. No; I may for ten minutes - I do not think I was down stairs for twenty-five minutes while Mr. Hall was at Margate.</p>
               <p>Q. If a young man has given you a cheque, and it has been wrong, have you not asked how much he gave you last time? A. Yes; you have set me right - you were engaged with two ladies when you brought the 3s., but not when you brought the 7s. 1 1/2d., to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to MRS. HARLOW. Q. I believe at the time I was serving you, these ladies were sitting by you? A. Yes; you served them, and while you served them, tied up my parcel.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. When you were brought back, what took place? A. The prisoner denied having received more than 10s. 1 1/2d. - I said, "Either you or I must have wronged Mr. Hall;" he paused for a while - I again said,"Either you or I must be guilty; I will take my oath I paid you 14s. 1 1/2d." - he said, "Well, then, I admit I have kept it;" Mr. Halls said, "Goulbourne denies having taken more than 10s. 1 1/2d. of you;" I saw him take the first money to the desk, and heard him say "The lady will bring you 3s."</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Did not you say he was hunting for some paper? A. Yes; and the crape shawls for the ladies to look at were then on the counter, but I think the bill was made out before they were on the counter; I think the ladies applied to another young man first, and the prisoner said "If they will wait, I will attend to them;" the money laid on the counter at the time - he should have taken the bill up to the desk, but he did not; he gave it to me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address to the Court, positively denied all intention of keeping the money; stating that it arose from a mistake on his part, and that the prosecution was the result of vindictive motives on the part of Champness.</p>

            . On the 28th of July, I took hold of Wood, a little before three o'clock, having suspicion that he was picking pockets - I did not see him do any thing, but I had seen him for about an hour in company with the other two, passing up and down Ludgate-hill; I saw the prosecutor's handkerchief on the ground, just before he was aware he had lost it; I did not see it fall, but it was nearest to White - Wood was close to him, and Wells within one yard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were there many other persons there? A. Yes; I did not see Wells do any thing - they were altogether; I had before seen White attempt to pick a gentleman's pocket, and at that time Wells was about a yard and a half from him; I am a solicitor - I do not usually walk about the street; I had not seen Wells till within that hour, but I can swear he was one of them.</p>

            . I am a carrier. I saw the prisoners together by the Old Jewry - they walked towards the Mansion-house; I saw White take the handkerchief from this gentleman's pocket; I got out of my cart, and caught hold of him - he threw the handkerchief down; the other two were within a few yards of him - Wood was within a yard and a half of him, and Wells within four or five yards - Mr. Jeffries took hold of Wood - he then went into the Poultry, and took Wells.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were passing? A. Several; White was not twenty yards from the other two - there might be six or seven people between them when I saw White on one side of the road; Wells and Wood ran across to try to draw him away by whistling and beckoning, but he would not come - White was then following the prosecutor, but the robbery had not then been committed.</p>
               <p>MR. LEE to MR. JEFFRIES. Q. What time did you see them on Ludgate-hill? A. About two o'clock - I looked at St. Paul's clock; I think it was not past two - it could not be more than half-past two.</p>

            . On the 16th of August I was in Harrow-alley, about two o'clock in the morning; I went up the yard towards Mr. Newton's cellars, and saw the two prisoners coming out - I went up to them, and said,"What do you do here?" Parker went on - I stopped Turner, and said, "You seem very much loaded, you had better let me help you" - he had, I think, seven bottles about his body and in his coat-pockets; I took two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100144"/>bottles from him - he then pretended to run after the other prisoner; I called Stop thief! and did not lose sight of Turner - he was stopped as he crossed the street; Parker was brought in after I took Turner, and I have no doubt of his being the man that was with him - these are the two bottles I took from Turner; when he was stopped these bottles were broken, down his trousers, and these others were taken from him at the watch-house - I found this phosphorus-box on Parker; Mr. Newton's cellars are about three hundred yards from the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Where was this? A. In a yard up Harrow-alley, in Aldgate High-street - I have no doubt of Parker; I described his jacket - he was not in my presence half a minute, and I had never seen him before; I should not like to be too positive.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Is there any lamp in the passage? A. Yes, a gas-lamp just over where he was - I am positive I never lost sight of Turner; I was close at his heels - I knew him before.</p>

            .

            . On Sunday morning, the 16th of August, I was on duty, and heard the rattle spring - I ran up and saw Parker running; I laid hold of him - he let a bottle of wine fall, which broke all to pieces.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. It was a very wet night? A. Not then - it was very fine; it had been raining - I have no doubt the other bottle was intended for me, had it not slipped out of his hand before he had the opportunity of throwing it; I found by the smell that it was port-wine - I swear it was not claret.</p>
               <p>Turner's Defence. I had been at a public-house, and had occasion to go up this passage - I saw the bottles; I was going to apprize the owner of it - there is some sheep dung up the alley.</p>
               <p>Parker's Defence. I work on board some barges, for Mr. Curry, of Russell-buildings - I was going home, up Petticoat-lane, and the first watchman struck me; I certainly had three bottles, but they were not wine - he broke one, and one fell down; I did not run, but was going along, and the other watchman took me.</p>
               <p>MR. HILL. I have now opened the bottles - they are port, and we missed bottles of this description.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Had you occasion to inspect the cellar? A. I had been there two or three days before - no bottle is sold out of that cellar; they come to our house for it - I swear it was not sold, because I keep the books; I could see by the saw-dust that some had been taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the wine kept there for? A. For stock - we never go there for small quantities; we use it as a warehouse - it is a large cellar or vault; I missed fifteen bottles. TURNER - <rs id="t18290910-283-verdict1562" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the 20th of July a person came into the shop and asked for 50l. worth of French money - I counted out forty-five Napoleons into my hand and laid them on the counter; I turned to my desk to reckon what they would come to, and the person who came for them said he would step into Birch's and take something while I made the account; the prisoner then came in, seized a handful of the Napoleons, and ran off - I called my father from the back shop, and jumped over the counter - I pursued the prisoner down Pope's Head-alley and Lombard-street to the Mansion-house; a person I knew, of the name of Finch, was coming by, he saw I could hardly catch him, he caught him, and brought him back - the prisoner was running: Finch is not here; I took the prisoner to our counting-house, and went back to Pope's Head-alley to look for one Napoleon he had dropped, but it was gone; he had the rest of the money on him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were they in your possession? A. They were on the counter close before me; I did lose sight of the person who took them for perhaps half a minute or a quarter of a minute - he ran two hundred or two hundred and fifty yards before he was taken; it was about five o'clock - there were a great number of persons about - our dwelling-house is in the parish of St. Michael, Cornhill; the Napoleons were within half a yard of me - they had not been paid for.</p>

On Friday night, the 7th of August, my street door was double locked, by my son - when I came down in the morning the box was broken off and the lock was double shot - these gold mouldings which had been on the landing of the stairs were gone; they had been rolled up in a green baize as they are now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When was this? A. On Saturday morning, the 8th of August - I did not call a constable - I know a man of the name of Smith, who came half drunk to examine the door, after the prisoner had been examined two or three times - he said he came to examine the door, but he did not - I certainly was taken into custody on this charge myself, and my son; I believe that was the only charge ever made against me - I have no recollection of ever being taken up on a charge of felony; I do not recollect that I was ever taken up; if I ever was, I have forgotten it - I cannot swear to a thing I do not recollect - I have been on a Jury, and I have been a constable - I cannot give any other answer; I have known Smith but a short time; I do not know that he is a constable - I have not received any money for the evidence I am to give - I borrowed some money of Mr. Edwards; I expect the reward according to the hand-bill as I took the prisoner with the property, and if it belongs to any body, I suppose it does to me - I did not say to Edwards, "You may as well let me have some money now, as it will be part of the 5l.,; and I am sure of convicting him;" I had about 2l. which I borrowed, and the boy's wages; the boy has seven shillings a week - I had seven shillings on that, and I think I borrowed four times ten shillings of him - I believe the prisoner has a high shoe, but he can walk as well as I can - I believe I received 1l. of Mr. Edwards, on the first or second examination - I did not borrow it to get my clothes out of pawn, that I might be a respectable witness - some of my clothes were in pawn, and very likely I might take some of them out with that money - I was kept in custody from Saturday night till Monday, and was examined before Alderman Ansley - I did drink a glass of gin with the prisoner when we were looking after the moulding - I did not know him before; but when I heard where the mouldings were, I went to him politically, as I understood he had offered them to Fairbrother - I went to the Spotted Dog, and found the prisoner; I called him out, and said,"I want to speak you; but we won't go into the taproom, as there are some people there" - he made no objection to go into the parlour; he said, "I thought you were coming to tap me on the shoulder for a bill of exchange;" I said, "No, Ward, I am nothing in that way; but Fairbrother says you know a person who has some mouldings to sell;" he said, "They are as far off as Mile-end-road;" I said, "I don't mind going as far as that;" he said, "You can't see them; a friend of mine took them for a bad debt, but if you will give me 3l. 10s., I will go and fetch them;" I said, "No, but call in the landlord;" the landlord came - I said, "I will put two sovereigns in your hand, to bind the bargain; and if Ward brings the mouldings, and they are what I want, I shall have thirty shillings more to give;" the prisoner then called a man named Nelson from the tap-room, and went out to fetch the mouldings; in fifteen or twenty minutes Nelson and he brought in these mouldings; he said, "Now, here they are;" my son was present, and I believe the landlord - I looked at them, and I said, "Mr. Ward, last Saturday morning my front-door was broken open, between five and six o'clock, and you are very much like the man that came out with these mouldings;" I gave charge of him - he said he thought I had behaved very bad to him; I said, "You need not think any thing of that, as I was taken up, and was forty-eight hours in hold;" the officer said, "You had better tell who was with you;" he said, "I will have my b-y neck broken before I will split;" the reason I called him Ward was, because his wife went with me, and she called him Ward - I might have been in the same room with him before, but not to my knowledge - I have not drank gin with him before or since.</p>

            , to leave work at seven o'clock, and take them to Mr. Moore's at the other end from the town, instead of which he stopped at his father's, the last witness, and left them there - I have seen them in the hands of the officer, and know them to be mine; also the baize and the cloth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined Q. How many whole windows are there in Hough's house? A. I think very few; there are very few panes of glass whole - it is very much dilapidated; I know Smith - he is a gilder; he is not a constable now - Hough has had 2l. from me by three instalments; I do not recollect when he had the first, but he said it was to enable him to appear respectable at Guildhall to give evidence - he asked for it for the purpose of taking his clothes out of pawn; but before the second hearing he sent for some more money I would not let him have it - he came in his former dishabille; whether he asked for any more then or no I cannot say - he did ask for it on the ground of what he should receive on conviction, but I said I was so little acquainted with those things, that I did not know whether he was the right man to have it, but at any rate he could not have it till after the conviction - he has made no proposition to me to quash this prosecution; he is glad it has happened, and wanted to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100146"/>make as much of a job of it as possible - after I refused to let him have any more money, he was ungenerous enough to serve me with a writ for false imprisonment, and I was taken up.</p>

            . I was in Mr. Edward's employ, and received this property to take to Mr. Moore's, in St. Martin's-lane, but I took it to my father's house, as I have done before - I double locked the street door, and the next morning the box of the lock was off, the lock double-shot, and the door broken open; I ran out into the street very much alarmed, and a young woman said she saw two men, one in a fustian dress, a tall thin man, and the other a short stout man, with a blue frock coat and black apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of house is your father's? A. A very large house - I was quite surprised at finding the door open; I had locked it - the windows are nailed up all but one; there are not above two or three panes broken - my master has said before, that if I felt myself tired I might leave my work at my father's; I was taken up, and so was my father; we have served a writ on Mr. Edwards - Smith came to examine the door; he did not examine it very attentively; he came tipsy with another man - I do not know whether he examined the door - he was standing on the steps; I suppose his eyes were three quarters of a yard from the door.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You thought, from your master's practice, you might leave these at your father's? A. Yes: I was to have received some more in the wood at Mr. Moore's, and he said if I was tired I might leave them at my father's.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARDS. I went out about dinner time, and told him I wished him to leave work at seven o'clock, and take them.</p>

            . I was near Mr. Hough's house about half-past five o'clock that morning, and saw two young men come out of the house without anything; they went towards Gough-square - the prisoner has the features of one of them; I observed he was a stout man, but I cannot say it was the prisoner - before six o'clock I saw a man go and push the door open, go to the corner, then go into the house, and bring something out in a green cloth on his shoulder, and go towards Gough-square; I did not know they were mouldings - I afterwards saw the boy crying, and said, "What have you lost?" he told me, and I said, "It was gone out of your house before six o'clock."</p>

            . I am a picture-frame maker. The prisoner came to me about the 10th of August - he called me down stairs, and said a person at the end of the court had something to sell in my way; he did not know exactly what; I went to the end of the court - a person there pulled out a piece of moulding, and said he had some hundreds of yards of it for sale; I said I did not want any of it - the prisoner was at the opposite side of the court; the mouldings were similar to these - I told Mr. Hough of it, and he asked if I could tell him where the person lived who offered them; I took him to the prisoner's house, in Star-court - he is a very respectable man; he is lame - no one can see him walk without knowing it; he goes very much on one side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known him? A. About four years: I was not at the public-house when he was apprehended - I came in afterwards, and went to the watch-house; I did not hear him say he would rather be hanged than split - I do not think he did.</p>

            . I received the prisoner on the 11th of August. In taking him to the watch-house, I said he should tell where he got them - he said he would suffer his neck to be twisted, or something, before he would let any one into it; they were found at the Spotted Dog, in Clement's-lane.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not the word he used, that he would sooner have his neck twisted than peach? A. That might be the word - I understood sooner than implicate another person.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was it? A. I should surmise that there was some other person connected with the robbery, and he would sooner take the whole weight upon himself than tell of any other person - Fairbrother was in custody at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He spoke rather angrily, I believe? A. Yes; I cannot charge my memory as to whether I spoke to him about my being in difficulties, and had got over them - I might have said it, or I might not; I have been tried, but I really do not know whether I said so to him or no - it was an attempt at a rape charged against me - you pleaded the cause for me, and I was honourably acquitted.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am totally innocent; it is necessary to state that I wear a cork shoe four inches high - this girl said she saw some person come out like my features; this prosecution has been got up for the money - this man got bills stuck up; a person came to me, and asked if I knew a person in the gilding line - I said, Yes, and directed him to Fairbrother; Hough then came to me with my wife, and made me drink; as he told the Alderman - he made people drunk, and then got any thing out of them; he then said I knew a person who had some gilt mouldings, and if I would bring them, he would give me 2l., and no questions should be asked - he then sent for a constable, and had us all taken. <rs id="t18290910-285-verdict1574" type="verdictDescription">

Yes; there were a great many people - I distinctly saw the prisoner take the handkerchief; he was not a yard from me - I went back and looked for the gentleman, but could not find him; I had not an opportunity of mentioning it to him at the time, because I was hustled by the prisoner's confederates - I had seenthem with the prisoner before; there were four of them.</p>

             called and told me where the property was; when I saw Mr. Scate, I told him I was come to pay the rent and the expences, but there was no rent due - the things were not on the premises when the rent became due. I was before Sir George Farrant - Mr. Scate was sent for several times, but he did not come, and Sir

             advised me to prefer a bill against him - I did not owe any rent at the time the things were removed; he removed them by my direction in the first instance, and then he got Mrs. Sanders, who was my landlady, to allow him to seize - I have not got my property again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Should you know Mrs. Sanders' hand-writing? A. Yes; I believe the name of "Dinah Sanders" to this paper, is her writing - I am not aware that I have gone by a dozen names; I am come into Court quite unprepared to meet the trial, and my most essential witness is out of town - I have not gone by any names, known to Scate but Harwood, and that name he has seized in; I have gone by three names, but not by any other name than Harwood in this affair - I did go by the name of Richardson, from family circumstances; I have a brother by the same father but not by my mother; he has a brass plate on his door in the name of Edgar, and I have been addressed as Miss Edgar in the way of business - I lived at Brompton when I went by the name of Richardson: I knew a gentleman of that name, but in consequence of my own family, I must beg leave to decline answering these questions.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When did you remove? A. On the 8th of August, and the rent was due on the 10th - the things were left under Scate's care, in Leicester-street, where he took them from Well-street, till a debt was paid; he was to remove them merely as a broker, not to keep them - I had a landlady named Mrs. Sanders; my quarter with her expired on the 10th of August - before I removed I paid her all; I believe she is here to prove it - I had entrusted this property to be taken care of by Scate; he removed it from Leicester-street to Bear-street, under a distress for rent due to Mrs. Sanders, as he said, but I owed her none - the things were taken out of the drawers and pawned; there was a purse with a sovereign in it, and some duplicates - Scate redeemed some of the things.</p>
               <p>Mr. PHILLIPS. Q. You have sworn to your landlady's writing? A. I have sworn to my belief of it; I never saw her write but once - she told me she had signed a warrant; this paper is not my hand-writing - I will swear it is not.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever sign any receipt? A. Never, but in the presence of witnesses; I only signed two receipts - one for 2l. 5s. 9d., and one other; the value of my property was about 60l.; Mr. Seale's bill is 7l. 1s.; I have not seen all my property - a purse, a sovereign, and some duplicates are missing; no one has given me any account of that money - the property I have seen is worth about 40l.; that is now detained for the 7l. - (paper read.)</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The two half-crowns and sovereign were in your right-hand pocket, and the three halfpence in the other? A. Yes; I was ten or eleven hundred yards from the public-house I had come out of; it was the Blue Coat Boy, in Dorset-street; there are warehouses where I was robbed; it was half-past twelve o'clock; I had just come out of the public-house, and was leaning my hand against a dray - I left work at eight o'clock, and went to have a pint of beer at the Seven Stars, in Brick-lane, with two of my shopmates and one of their brothers; we had two pots of beer there, and whether it was one or two quarterns of gin I cannot be certain - I changed a shilling there, and paid for one pot of beer; I put a few halfpence towards the gin - I spent 10 1/2d. altogether; my day's wages was 3s. 6d.; we then went to the Blue Coat Boy, had one pot of beer and one quartern of gin; we went there about half-past ten o'clock, and staid till twelve - we drank no more; I was quite sober; I saw the prisoner searched at the watch-house; I do not know that he stated the exact money he had in his pockets; no sovereign was found upon him; he did tell me to go home for a drunken fellow, and not to follow him, for he was not the man; I was calling Stop thief! because he was going away from me; I do not know any thing about him - I never was in a Court of Justice or before a Magistrate - I go to work at six o'clock in the morning.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 8th of August I was on duty in Brick-lane, between twelve and one o'clock; I heard a cry of Watch! and ran as fast as possible; when I got to Black Eagle-street, where the drays stand, I saw a bat lay; I passed that, and went on; the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner, he said, "I give you charge of him, he has robbed me of a sovereign;" he did not then mention any half-crown; but in going along he said he had lost two half-crowns and three half-pence -I took the prisoner back; the prosecutor took up his hat, and we went to the watch-house - I could perceive the prosecutor had been drinking; but he walked, and told his story very sensibly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Would you say he told the truth if he said he was quite sober? A. He had been drinking, but he must have gone very rapidly to the place where he took the prisoner - he seemed capable of knowing what he was about; I think he had taken rather too much - he did not, at that time, say in which pocket he had his different monies; I saw the prisoner pull the money out of his own pocket - there were two half-crowns, and I think 7 1/2d.; but the watchman has nothing to do with that.</p>

            . I was the watch-house-keeper. The prisoner was brought there, and searched in my presence - there were two half-crowns and 7 1/2d. on him; the prosecutor charged him with having robbed him of a sovereign, two half-crowns, and 1 1/2d. - he appeared to tell his story sensibly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he been drinking? A. Yes, I thought so, and at first refused to take the charge,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100150"/>but afterwards he told his story so correctly I did not think he had been drinking; the reason I thought he had been drinking at first was he seemed in a great flustration, and said he had been robbed a great many times over - I did not think he was drunk but that he had been drinking; at first he kept saying, "I have been robbed of a sovereign and 5s." for several minutes: and from his manner I did not think it was true - he did not at first say which pockets the coin had been in, but afterwards said the half-crown and sovereign were in one pocket and the 1 1/2d. in the other; I knew him by sight - the prisoner produced the money himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home from work at half-past eight o'clock - I said to my father, "Shall I go and enter myself into that benefit society to night?" he said,"You are getting a young family, I think it would be advisable;" I said my master would not give me any money - he said, "You shall not be lost for that;" and he went out, changed a sovereign, and lent me two halfcrowns and one shilling - I went to the Sugar Loaf to be entered, but the man, who was to propose me, was not there; I stopped, and had a pint of porter, a small glass of gin, and a short pipe of tobacco, which cost 4 1/2d. -I remained there to see if this man was there when the society broke up, but he did not come; that made me late - as I turned into Grey Eagle-street to go home this young man came and said, "I will have you about my sovereign;" I said, "Go about your business, you drunken fellow" - he laid hold of me, the watchman came up, and took me; the watchman said, "Come to the watch-hosue, you can see the man is drunk."</p>

               <p>Five witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . My house is No. 24, Spital-square, in the Liberty of Norton-falgate; it is extra parochial. On Wednesday, the 27th of May, when I came home, about half-past five or six o'clock, in consequence of information, I went to the warehouse, and found it broken open - a wooden window, which had originally been a door, and slides up and down, was taken down - I found every thing on the counter as I had left them in the morning, and did not examine the rest of my stock till Saturday morning, when I had to execute some orders, and the very goods I wanted to send out were gone - I reckon that above nine hundred yards of silk were gone; I was in the habit of seeing it every day, and am sure it was there on the Tuesday and Wednesday morning - I know it was there; I missed fourteen pieces, containing about nine hundred yards - the value is about 320l.; the shortest piece was worth at least 12l. - I am certain no piece was worth less than 5l. On the 7th of August I was going along the Quadrant, in Regent-street, and saw part of one of my pieces of silk in the shop of Mr. Poulson, a tailor; I went in, and asked the price of it - I examined it, and was sure it was mine; Poulson gave me a pattern of it, and on the 20th of August I went there with an officer, and found the piece in the same state as when I first saw it - I brought it away, and there was a short length of another piece; the officer has them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any other name? A. No, nor any partner; I reside at the house - the silks were on the ground floor.</p>
               <p>Q. How does it happen that you did not discover the robbery the next morning? A. Being trustee to an estate I was obliged to go out next morning early - the property might have been stolen between the Wednesday and Saturday, for what I know; I was in the habit of seeing those fourteen pieces of silk every day before Wednesday - I was busy out of doors on Thursday and Friday- when I was at Poulson's I fixed on one piece of silk, which I said belonged to me; and it did not afterwards turn out that it had been in the shop for six months previous- I went to Mr. Shoolbred's and saw a good many pieces of silk, but none of mine; there were several young men there- I do not recollect seeing a little boy; I saw Mr. Shoolbred's brother - I fixed on a piece of silk there I thought was mine, but found afterwards it was not; no little boy spoke to me about it - there was a young man who said it had been in the shop six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you not ascertained that it had been there previously, and did not belong to you - would you not have sworn as positively to that as you do now to the silk in the indictment? A. No; because I found it was a different colour - mine was gold and blue, and that was yellow and blue.</p>

I was servant to Mr. Bloom at the time of the robbery - I went down stairs to answer the bell about four o'clock, and saw the wooden window of the warehouse was taken down; it had been safe when I saw it in the morning, about half-past six or seven o'clock - I had passed it after that, and had not observed it out; I had been by in the course of the morning, it was safe the last time I went by; when I found it down I informed Miss Bloom - the sash-lines were cut, and the window put down on the ground.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your master was out? A. Yes; I do not know what time he came home - he was informed the shutter had been taken down and the rope of the window cut; there was no alarm made till he came home; I cannot say how many people had been to the house between half-past four and six o'clock - persons had been to the house; I was engaged up in the parlour, and Miss Bloom was up in the bed room: I was down in the kitchen from twelve o'clock to half-past four; I cannot see the wooden window from there - there is a middle door before you enter the place where the window is - my mistress was in the parlour and sometimes in the bed room from twelve to four; I had not seen any persons near the premises outside - the robbery was not committed before two o'clock, for I was down in the kitchen before two, and I know that Miss Bloom went into the warehouse about three.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in the Quadrant, Regent-street. I bought both these pieces of silk, which are claimed by the prosecutor, of Mr. Shoolbred, in Tottenham-court-road - I bought the brown piece on the 23rd of June, I cannot exactly recollect when I bought the other - here is the invoice of it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the brown a common or uncommon pattern? A. Very common; I have purchased many silks of the same make, but never bought any of exactly the same colour; the manufacture of the silk is very general, there is plenty of the same material made - I know by the invoice I bought it of Shoolbred, and can swear it is the piece I bought of him - I had no other of the same colour; I cannot say whether it was delivered in my presence or that I received it myself; I have no knowledge of any other silk being in the house, and will swear I had it from nobody but Shoolbred, though I might not be at home when it was brought - I call it slate colour, some call it grey - it is quite a common description of silk; I have no other reason for saying I bought it of Shoolbred than I have stated.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. You had no other piece of silk in your possession? A. Not of that description.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you make any bargain with Shoolbred about it? A. I bought it at his house; I believe I made the bargain with his brother; it was sent to my house; here is the invoice.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is there any brown silk mentioned here? A. No; here is ten yards and a quarter of silk.</p>

            . I am a mercer and draper, and live at No. 155, Tottenham-court-road. I had a piece of brown silk like this in my possession, and sold a piece like it to Poulson on the 23rd of June; I sold him several others; I sold him a piece like this other - one of the lengths I sold him was part of a piece I bought of Vanberg - I do not know this from any mark, but there was a brown piece of a very similar colour I bought of Vanberg - it is part of the length; I bought of Vanberg one hundred and fourteen yards and a half, and produce the invoice and the cheque I paid him; it was of various colours - I bought it as one hundred and fourteen yards and a quarter of balantine on the 12th of June; the colours of these two pieces are similar, but I have no mark on them, and cannot swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have been some years in the business? A. Yes; the silk produced are the most common patterns that are made - I would not take on myself to swear to the silk of this pattern, unless I had a mark on it: I can generally tell who I purchase silks of, because I mark all the rollers - I do not mark the silk; these rolls of silk were mixed with my stock - I have only been in this particular branch of the business two years, and have had from four to five hundred pieces of silk of this description, in that time - there will generally be a little difference in the colour; I was not at home when Bloom came to my shop, but came in before he left - my shopman is not here; one piece of silk was given into my hand - there was a piece, which I knew to be mine; Bloom said nothing about that in my presence - I did not receive the silks from Vanberg; he brought me up the silks one day, and I offered him 4s. 6d. a yard; he would not take less than 4s. 9d., and took them away - next day, when I was out, he came with them; I did not receive them myself - some of my servants attended before the Magistrate.</p>

            . I am a shop-seller and tailor. I know the prisoner; he came to my shop the beginning of June, and had some silk to sell - it was on a Tuesday or Wed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100153"/>nesday; I cannot say it was the beginning of June - he did not say what quantity he had, but I bought one hundred and fourteen yards of him, and delivered the same silks I bought of him to Vanberg, to sell for me - the prisoner brought it to my house in rolls and in a bag; I cannot say whether the silk produced is the same - I cannot tell whether there was any like this; they were waistcoat silks - this is waistcoat silk; I sent my nephew to Vanberg to make inquiries about the price of silks, but for nothing else then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You sent him to ascertain the value? A. Yes, just to see what it was worth - that was after I made the purchase; it was a very common kind of silk from what I saw - I cannot say this is the same; Vanberg had it to sell on commission - I am sure of that; it was about the 7th or 8th of June - I cannot state the time particularly; I was examined before the Magistrate about a month ago, I suppose - it was in June I bought the silk; I think it was in June - I generally keep books, but sometimes do not use them, and did not on this occasion.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long had you the silk before it went to Vanberg? A. I cannot say; I dare say about nine or ten days - I sent my nephew to borrow 20l. of him to pay for them; he brought me a 10l. and two 5l. notes - that was the same day as I purchased the silk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The day you purchased the silk of Joel you sent your nephew to borrow the money of Vanberg? A. Yes, that was the time - I sent him to make inquiries, to ascertain the price - I bought the silk about two hours after I got the money, but did not send them to Vanberg the same day; it was about two or three days after - when the prisoner came with the silk, my little nephew called me up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those two pieces - you are not asked whether they are the same, but are they at all similar or like what you bought of the prisoner? A. I cannot swear whether they are at all like; I saw the two pieces of silk before the Magistrate - I cannot tell whether these are the same they are similar to what were produced before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were those produced before the Magistrate similar to what you bought of Joel? A. They were similar to them, but I cannot tell whether they are the same.</p>

            , JUN. I am the last witness' nephew. I cannot say that I know the prisoner; I have seen him pass many times - I saw him at my uncle's the beginning of June, when he came and told Mr. Israel he had some silks to show him, but what sort of silks I cannot say; I called Mr. Israel to him, what Joel said I cannot tell, because I never see business transacted; when I called Israel down - I went out of doors and never saw any business transacted; Mr. Israel sent me to Vanberg for 20l.; I got a 10l. and two 5l. notes, which I gave him - I cannot say what day that was; I believe it was the same day as Joel was there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know whether it was the same day or not? A. I cannot swear it was; Joel was not in the shop when my uncle sent me for the money - I cannot say what it was for; I told Vanberg my uncle wanted to borrow 20l. - I did not tell him what for; I did not ask him the proper price to give for silks.</p>

               <p>Q. Your uncle states he sent you there to inquire, recollect yourself, and say whether you can say it was on the same day? A. It was the same day, I am sure - I came back and gave my uncle the money in the shop; I did not see Joel then, and do not know what my uncle did with the money.</p>

            . I am nephew and shopman to Isaac Israel, and know the prisoner. I saw him at my uncle's shop the beginning of June - he had a bag with him; I did not see what was in it exactly - I saw some silk in it; I took some samples of silk to Vanberg, by my uncle's direction - I showed him the samples, made inquiries of him, and took his answer back to my uncle; Israel gave me the samples - I did not see where he got them from; I saw Joel come in - I remained in the shop till my uncle gave me the samples; he cut them off the silk which he bought of Joel; I cannot take on myself to swear whether these two pieces were there.</p>
               <p>Q. Nobody asked you: I ask whether in the samples you took there was any of that description? A. Similar, but not the same; I cannot say it is the same, because it is out of my recollection - it is very near three months ago; I do not recollect whether it is the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Your master deals in silk, I suppose? A. Yes; it was early in June, but I do not know the day; my master has dealt with the prisoner several times in silks - I cannot give the date to any particular transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. How can you take on yourself to say they are not the same? A. Because it is out of my recollection - they are similar but not the same; I mean to say positively they are not the same.</p>

On the 20th of August I went with Mr. Bloom to Poulson's, and took two pieces of silk from the window, which I produce; I apprehended the prisoner on the night of the 21st, in Petticoat-lane - I took him to a public-house, in company with the street-keeper, and asked him if he knew a person named Israel - he said No; I again asked if he did not know Israel, who lived within three or four doors of the Mint, on Tower-hill; he then said Yes - I asked if he had sold Israel any silk for waistcoat pieces; he said No; I think I only asked him that once - I took him to another<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100154"/>public-house, and left him with Adams, while I fetched Israel - he was in a room with a dozen people, and the moment Israel went in, he said, "That is the man I had the silk of;" the prisoner made no answer - I took him to Worship-street.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was present when the prisoner was apprehended - Brown's statement is correct.</p>
               <p>MR. BLOOM. This brown silk is mine - I know it by the selvedge; I generally make white selvedges, but having a remnant of blue to get off, I put this blue to it - the silk was made by my direction; I could tell you how many threads there are in this selvedge, and how many in that; the other piece is also mine - there are eight claret-coloured threads outside the selvedge; I remember manufacturing silk of that sort - I lost three pieces of this description at the time of the robbery; two of them were sixty-eight yards long, and the other thirty-five and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many pieces of that description have you manufactured? A. I suppose one hundred of this pattern - the brown is a common pattern, but not a common colour; they are shots - it is brown and black, what we call a cane; I manufactured two of this description - one was a white selvedge, and the other of this colour; I sold the other two years ago - another manufacturer might put on exactly the same selvedge, but that is a hundred chances to one.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had the piece you sold the same selvedge as this? A. No, that was a white selvedge - this is blue and white.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is it not common to manufacture with a white selvedge? A. Yes; but not blue and white - I will not swear that no other manufacturer ever made with blue and white.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you ever manufactured any other with that selvedge? A. No, not of this colour; I sold twenty-five yards of this piece to Mr. Maund, of Corn-hill, and have got this piece back to prove it - I asked him to lend it to me; I sold it to him on the 2nd of May, and know it to be the same piece - I went there, and brought it away myself to compare; they are both one piece - they tally exactly in the selvedge; I am positive they are from one piece, and will swear it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Of how many yards did the piece originally consist? A. Eight-four; I sold twenty-five to Maund, and six and three quarters to Kestevens, of Milk-street; about fifty yards were taken out of my warehouse - the piece found is about seven or eight yards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What was the lady's age? A. As near as I can judge, between seventy and eighty - it might be seventy-five; there was that kind of habit in her which I should expect from a lady who had married early in life, and lived much abroad - she lived in lodgings much below her station; I believe that resulted from penurious habits - she went to lodge there on the 2nd of April, and had lodged there previously, between 1822 and 1824; I called on her there several times - I cannot recollect how often: I do not recollect where she went to lodge after that - I saw her repeatedly; I was scarcely a week without seeing her - I saw her when she lodged in Carey-street, in 1829, repeatedly, and she used to come either to my house or to some of my relations, every week; I sent her to the West Indies twice, at my own expense; before she went to Carter's I understood she lived in Portugal-street, after she left Carter's the first time; I did not visit her there, being much occupied in my profession, and she usually called on me or my family - I saw her last on the 1st of June; I left town the next morning for Brighton, for my own health, and left her better than I had seen her from the commencement of her illness in February - I left her dropsical and ill, but expected she would recover; she kept her bed when I left - she was confined to her bed all the time she was at Carter's; her complaint required it - I did not direct any medical friend to call on her; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100155"/>did not think it necessary, and it was my opinion she would not submit to any advice but my own - I had great difficulty to get her to submit to mine; she was of a determined mind, and would have her own will in every thing - she dressed respectable: not like a pauper - I think I saw her repeatedly at Carter's, but not so much as at Carey-street; I considered her convalescent on the 26th of March - I may have seen her once or twice a week at Carter's, but not for the last fortnight, till the night before I went to Brighton, having been ill myself; she was the only person I visited - she was confined there with the consequence of her former disease, and did not require my attendance there oftener than I have stated; she was in bed - I had not an opportunity of seeing her dressed; I saw her dressed at Carey-street, before she took to her bed - she certainly dressed in a way I thought unworthy of her; very much in the style of a pauper - but when she visited she dressed respectable; I had enabled her to become wholly independent, having sent her twice to the West Indies, at my own expense, to obtain an independent income, which she had been deprived of for twenty-five years - she had 200l. a year transferred to her by the Court of Chancery, and claimed a great deal more; she lodged on the ground floor in Carey-street - if it had been kept as I could have wished, I considered it a decent lodging, but it was dirty; she was attended by a servant whom she employed, and I got a nurse for her at my own expense.</p>

               <p>Q. When you told Mrs. Carter to send all the things to Charterhouse-square, did not she tell your Mrs. Keefe had left her every thing in the house? A. No, nothing like it - Mr. Franks, of Mill-hill was present, and Miss Springweiler; Mr. Franks is a Magistrate - she did not state this to me, nor in my hearing, but denied positively all knowledge of the notes; she did not say any thing had been left her by Mrs. Keefe - I claim on the property as sole administrator, to answer all claims as the whole of the estate; I have a sister who claims as well - we are her next relatives; I am a creditor of 150l.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Were you and the deceased on good terms? A. Perfectly so - we never had any difference; I thought she would recover on the 1st of June, and only required good nursing and nourishment - I had a better opinion of her then, than at any time from the commencement of her illness, and did not provide a nurse on that occasion, because I was satisfied with Mrs. Carter's attention up to that time; she had enjoyed the 200l. a year from 1821.</p>

            . I am single, and was intimately acquainted with Mrs. Keefe - I am no relation, but have been acquainted with her many years. I remember her going to live at Carter's on the 2nd of April; she was then in a bad state of health - I had visited her during her illness about twice a week till her death; I saw her last on Monday, the 1st of June - she died on the 8th; I know she was in possession of about 225l. in Bank notes - I had counted them for her on the 10th of April, and had them in my hand on the 15th; I did not see them on the 1st of June - they were deposited in her desk, of which she kept the key herself: it was put into a purse in a little drawer by her bed side - there was also a 200l. bill of exchange, four sovereigns and a half, and some ear-drops: I had seen those in April and May - I saw the bundle of notes about three weeks previous to my last visit; they appeared just the same in bulk as when I had opened them - the drops of her ear-rings were in the desk, and were gold; I saw them there in May - she was very particular about opening her desk; I frequently brought it to her, wishing her to open it herself if she wanted to go to it, but I used to open it when I was there: she used to direct me to take the key from the purse in this drawer, if she did not take it herself - when she wanted a note changed she employed me to do it, and was very particular about it; I changed a note for her last on the 10th of April, when I saw them altogether - about three weeks previous to my last visit or after that, she used to point to her desk and say to me, "There they are for you to pat your hand on in case any thing happens to me;" but generally added, "I am not going to die yet." On the 8th of June Mrs. Carter's son came to me at No. 1l, Charterhouse-square, and informed me of her death; I went almost immediately - Mrs. Carter told me she died about nine o'clock that morning very suddenly, and had been very angry in the night at her employing a nurse to attend her instead of herself - I asked why she employed a nurse without sending for me; she said she had been too ill to attend to her herself - I asked her for the key of the desk, saying I knew there were papers of consequence there; she said she had the key in her possession, went down, and brought it up - I opened the desk in her presence; I found it on the steps by the bed-side - I found all the papers in confusion; the bill of exchange was there, but neither the ear-drops nor any one of the Bank notes - I then said there was a parcel missing, which was of consequence to Dr. Farre; she replied if they were merely papers they could not be of much consequence, and stated that Mrs. Keefe had told her she had no money, but there was a bill of exchange coming due in October when she should be paid for her lodging - the bill in the desk is due in October; Mrs. Carter had told me, previous to this, that Mrs. Keefe was to pay her 13s. a week for lodging, and desired me, on one occasion, to apply to Mrs. Keefe to allow her 1s. a day more for her attendance - this was about the 10th of April; I made the application to Mrs. Keefe, who was very angry - she said 13s. was quite sufficient, and she would allow nothing more - on the 8th of June Mrs. Carter told me Mrs. Keefe had desired her to shut the doors against every body, and take charge of every thing; she did not say for what purpose - I left the desk there, taking home the 200l. bill and the West India letters; I went there, I believe, every day but two, till the funeral; notice was sent to Dr. Farre, who came to town that day week - I think I had no more conversation with her myself about the desk, but I went back on the day she died, with Mr.

            - he stated to her, in my presence, that the property was missing; she said she knew nothing about it - he asked who had been in the room; she said she knew nothing at all about it - on the 18th I went in company with Mr. Franks, and opened the desk; I was showing him, in Mrs. Carter's presence, the manner in which the notes used to lay there, and where the drops were in a small box in the desk - Mrs. Carter said she had picked the drops up in the fire-place, and sent her child down for them; the child<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100156"/>returned, and she gave them to me - we never examined any thing out of Mrs. Carter's presence; she heard what I said about where the notes used to lay; but gave no account of them, or what had become of them - I myself only asked her if she had met with any papers or parcels; but the notes were mentioned in her presence more than once - she said she knew nothing of them; Mr. Franks asked me for the key of the desk on the 26th of June, and took out both these papers (looking at them) in Mrs. Carter's presence - the desk was then locked, and I had the key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was Mrs. Keefe a woman rather grateful, as to acts of kindness done to her? A. I never thought her so - she made no will; I have no recollection of her saying any thing to me, but"There the notes are for you to put your hand on;" she did not tell me to give them to Dr. Farre, but I concluded that was her meaning - I saw her last on the day Dr. Farre did; she certainly appeared to require nursing very much, but appeared better, and I was prevented from going to see her - I am not aware that Mrs. Carter sat up one night with her - Mrs. Keefe had a stick to knock with to call her in the day time; I am not aware of her doing that in the night; Mrs. Carter did not appear to me to be particularly fatigued on the day of her death - she did not appear pregnant; I visited Mrs. Keefe almost daily in Carey-street - she was a very odd woman; her apartment at one time was in a filthy state: her dress was more like a pauper than a lady; she was a self-willed obstinate woman -I do not know why she returned to lodge at Carter's; I was surprised to hear of her going back, because I understood she had left there in anger - she had lived there before for two years; if she had wanted the desk in my absence, she could not lift it herself, but must have some one to bring it to her; Mrs. Carter's words were that Mrs. Keefe had told her to shut the door against every body, and take charge of every thing; she did not say she had given her every thing.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she on any occasion insist that the notes, or any other property, had been given to her? A. No; she only said she was to take charge of every thing.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you never hear Mrs. Keefe say she intended to make Carter a compliment? A. Once, when I applied about the shilling a day, she said, in an angry manner, "I will make her a compliment;" I did not take out all the papers when I first examined the desk - I turned them over in the desk, and opened every West Indis letter; there were a great many papers; it was not full- I did not put any papers on the steps, or on the bed, nor put them on one side; there was no room to do so - there were a great many loose papers - I examined them, and am certain there were no Bank notes among them; I might be ten minutes rummaging the desk.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you live in the house of Dr. Farre's father, as one of the family? A. Yes - I frequently went to see Mrs. Keefe, when Dr. Farre did not; Mrs. Carter knew I was a member of the family, no doubt - if the desk was brought to Mrs. Keefe, she could open it with the key, and put the key away in its proper place; Mrs. Carter said she was assisting her out of bed, that her head dropped on her shoulder, and she died immediately - when Mrs. Keefe said she would make her a compliment she did not fix any time for it, in words or otherwise.</p>

On the 8th of June I went with Miss Springweiler to Mrs. Carter's house - I said I had no hesitation in telling her that notes to a considerable amount were missing from the desk, and I was sure, for her own sake, she would be anxious to afford some explanation of it, as it appeared to me very mysterious; she said she knew nothing about them, and could not be answerable for them - I saw her again on the 10th and 26th - I believe she was asked by Miss Springweiler whether she could afford any further information about the paper - she could not; the desk was opened on both occasions before me - Mrs. Carter was the only person in the room; I saw

            , ESQ. I live at Mill-hill, and am a Magistrate of Middlesex. I went to Carter's with Mr. Farre and Miss Springweiler, on the 18th of June, and saw Mrs. Carter - Miss Springweiler desired her to come up stairs; she came up - I asked her where she took the key of the desk from: she said, "Out of the drawer, by the bed-side, and it was in a purse;" I asked what made her take the key; she said she thought she had a right to take it; I told her she did very wrong; she had made herself liable by so doing - I did not say to what she was liable; she was agitated, and shook very much - I said all she ought to have done was to close the eyes of the deceased, tied a handkerchief round her mouth, locked the door, and sent for her relations - she made no answer: I asked to see her daughter Catherine, who is about twelve years old, and asked her, in her mother's presence, whether Mrs. Keefe had laid quiet in the night she died, and if she was out of the room the whole night - she said she laid very quiet, as usual - I asked if she had asked for the desk; the daughter said she had asked for it on the Friday before the Sunday, and she had handed it to her on the bed - I asked what Mrs. Keefe took out of it; she said a sovereign, and gave it her to get change; I asked if she had left any papers or things on the bed, after she had locked the desk - she said she had not left any thing, and Mrs. Keefe told her to put the desk where it was, and the key and purse in the drawer where she usually kept it - I then requested Miss Springweiler to open the desk, and look into every part of it very particularly - it was searched, but no notes found; the notes were not mentioned - Miss Springweiler asked Mrs. Carter if the ear-drops had been in the desk; she said she would go and fetch them - I said, "Don't move out of the room, you may send for them;" and she sent the child, who brought them up -Mrs. Carter said she found them under the grate: I wished to see the nurse, who had attended Mrs. Keefe that night - they sent for

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The last was the only time the notes were specifically mentioned? A. That was the only time - I did not announce myself as a Magistrate; I acted as a friend of Dr. Farre, he being a professional man, and not able to attend - I was not acting as a Magistrate; I told her she had made herself liable - she was frightened before that; she could hardly hold herself still; she did not appear ill - I did not desire that she should be taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go there as a Magistrate, or merely as a friend of Dr. Farre? A. As a friend; the little girl said she had slept with Mrs. Keefe that night.</p>
               <p>The papers proved to be in the hand-writing of Carter, which were put in and read as follows -"Mrs. Keefe died 11th."Mr. Dr. Farre, 11, Charter-house-square."</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I took Mrs. Carter into custody in August; on our way to the office she said that the notes were given her by Mrs. Keefe - that Mrs. Keefe had called her little girl and given her a 200l. bill, but the child could not read, and she took it away from her again; I then asked, if any of the notes should be traced with the name of Carter on them, what she would say? - she said, "It will be all very well; they were given to me - indeed she gave me all;" I understood her to mean all that was in the desk, and I think she said, "I am sorry I let the desk go." I afterwards apprehended Carter, Sen.; he said his wife had given him the notes; that he had passed them, and he was not ashamed of it - that his name was on them; that he had passed them at a public-house in his neighbourhood, and one at an ironmonger's - that his wife had not acted right, for she should have brought him the key of the room, and then he would have kept the whole property, for he understood her it had been given to her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You went to Mrs. Carter's and took her? A.

               <p>Elizabeth Carter delivered in a long written defence, stating that she was on the most familiar terms with the deceased, who usually called her "Dear Carter, &amp;c.;" and felt unhappy if any one but herself attended to her; and that, a few days previous to her death, she told her to send her daughter out of the room, and then gave the notes into her hand, telling her to keep them if she died, and telling her to take every thing in the place for herself, and had often promised to make her and family comfortable.

I should think four or five times - I was not at all intimate with her; every time I went into the room she talked about her property that she had given it to Mrs. Carter; I only saw her four times - the first time might have been five or six weeks before her death; she told me about the handsome compliment on the Friday - she said there was a time-piece on the mantel-shelf which had been given to her by an old sweetheart, and she had given that to Mrs. Carter; I heard nothing of Carter wanting 1s. more to attend her - I was not with her more than ten minutes when she died; she was sitting on the nightchair, but I assisted Mrs. Carter to put her into bed - that was at near ten o'clock in the morning; I never told the officer of this - I was at the office on the day Mrs. Carter went to prison.</p>

I want no one here but you, you are the first here" - Catherine Carter, the daughter, slept in the room before Mrs. Keefe died, and had done so for some time; on the Sunday night Mrs. Carter asked if she wanted Miss Springweiler - she said she did not want her there; she owed her nothing - "I want none here but you, Carter;" I remember her once sending for

I could see there were two men, and I knew Haygreen's voice; he had talked very much at the public-house - I speak to him by his voice, his jacket, and his height; it was very dark, but I knew him again perfectly well, both by his dress, person, and every thing - he had a cap on; I did not notice whether the other people had caps; there might be eight, ten, or more in the house; there was a man called Austin there, and I hear he has absconded - I cannot say whether he had a cap on; my daughter had a little of the beer on the road, but I drank the best part of it - it might be ten o'clock or half-past when we got to the Crown; I do not think we sat under the tree above two or three minutes; I saw no one but Haygreen take liberties with her, farther than forcing themselves up against her; he kissed her, I cannot say how many times; I will say twice - that is as much as I know; he lifted the veil up to do it, she did not lift it up to my knowledge - she did not put her arm round his neck nor round any other man's; I believe no one took liberties with her but him - she went into the passage and beckoned to me to come home, not to him; whether any man went out to her I cannot say - I did not go home, as it rained hard; I did not like the company altogether, and I thought some might be going our way; I do not know who asked her to sing first - the man who has absconded sat next to her - I said, "They are all hard working people, I dare say - it will be no harm, sing if you like;" she sung, "Ye coachmen all," &amp;c., for she said she did not recollect one - I said, "You do sing that at home;" I do not recollect telling her to sing another afterwards; the officers were very close to us when the men came up -I do not recollect the man, who brought us the beer under the tree, telling us we had better go home; they never separated my daughter's arm from me - it was drawn back by pulling - her arm was clenched in with mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Might not the bundle be drawn out with their trying to get your daughter? A. It was drawn out by a hand; I will swear I saw it in the man's hand, and felt it taken.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I was on duty near the Crown a few minutes before half-past eleven o'clock; I was standing up against the pales, taking shelter, as it was very dark and stormy - I saw the two witnesses coming along the middle of the road; two men came after them - when they got up to them a kind of scuffle ensued; I heard a female say, "Father, take out your pistol and shoot them;" a male voice answered directly,"D-n your eyes, if you don't leave my daughter alone, I will shoot you;" I hallooed out, "What are you after there?" I might be twenty yards from them - the two men immediately ran away - I said to the party, "Don't be frightened, it is only the patrol;" the old man called out,"Then run patrol - they have robbed me of a bundle;" I immediately pursued the men - we lost sight of them entirely: it was very dark - we followed footsteps to the corner of Child's-hill-lane, about two hundred yards, and then lost the sound; I returned, and found the prisoners in custody, near the Crown - I said to the girl, "Are either of these the men?" she said Yes, Haygreen was the one who took hold of her round the waist - that she could swear it, and the father said he was the man; Haygreen said he was mistaken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the men pass you in going after them? A. No, we were beyond them - I do not know a man named Austin; I had been into the Crown at a quarter past ten o'clock, to light a pipe, and saw the prosecutor and his daughter sitting there by themselves; there might be twenty persons there - it was full of people, labouring men and some women, girls of the town; I never knew Haygreen.</p>

            . I am a patrol, and was with Thompson near the fourth mile-stone; I observed people coming from the Crown, and when they got within thirty yards of us, I heard a female voice say, "Father, why don't you draw your pistol and shoot them?" I heard a man say, "D-n you, if you don't let her alone, I will shoot you;" two men ran away - we called out, and the party called out, "Make haste, patrol - they have got my bundle;" we followed them as far as Child's-hill-lane; it was too dark for me to see them - Thompson and I went up the lane, and Blaney went up the road; in seven or eight minutes I saw the prisoners in Mr. Prior's chair - it is a garden chair, that stands about one hundred and fifty yards from the Crown - they were both sitting there; I told them we apprehended them on suspicion of a robbery that had been committed; I searched the chair and them, but found no property - they made no answer, nor any resistance; Blaney came up, and we took them to the Crown - the prosecutor and his daughter had come up in about ten minutes; both said they thought they could identify Haygreen if they had a light - we took them to the Crown - the daughter fainted as soon as she entered; we got a light, and went out to took for the property - I was not present when the daughter came too; I left the house entirely.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The night was very dark indeed? A. Yes; Prior's chair is a sort of alcove, which will hold six or eight people - it stands by the side of the path, and people may sit in it; there was a young woman sitting with them, and another standing about forty yards off - the chair is enclosed, except at the door-way.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with the witnesses - I heard the prosecutor and his daughter coming along before this happened; they were about fifteen yards from me, when I heard the daughter say, "Father, take your pistol, and shoot them;" I then perceived two men run away - the father said, "Make haste, they have got<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100161"/>my bundle;" I had not distinguished the features of either of them - I lost sight of them, and saw them in Covington's custody in about eight minutes; I saw the prosecutor and his daughter - they said the dark man. Haygreen, was the man who took hold of the daughter - they could not speak to the other.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Covington took them in the chair? A. He saw them in the chair about a minute before me; I made them come out - the witnesses said they could not speak to them till they had a light; when they saw them by the light at the Crown, they spoke to Haygreen - I had only seen two figures moving along: I could not tell it was the prosecutor and his daughter - I do not know of any man absconding from Wilsden.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you afterwards go to the spot where this happened to look for the bundle? A. Yes; we searches there with a light that night, and could not find one.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Crown. The prosecutor and his daughter came there about three o'clock in the day, and had two pints of porter - they returned rather before nine, I should think, and had a pint of porter under the tree - they then went into the tap-room; there were eighteen or twenty haymakers and labourers there - there was a lad named Austin who, I understand, has left the neighbourhood - he had a cap on; the prosecutor and his daughter went, and sat among the rest of the men, they did not appear alarmed - very far from it; the young girl sang several songs at her father's request - I believe she drank with most of the men; she was in two or three parts of the room, and I believe drank wherever she sat - they were there nearly two hours; I turned them all out together - I saw Haygreen lift up her veil, and kiss her two or three times; I saw nobody else kiss her - they returned to my house about three quarters of an hour after it was cleared - it was full that time; I have known Haygreen for three years - he was servant to Mr. Tilyard, and had the care of about one hundred cows; he was strictly honest, and rather above a man in his station.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was it not raining very hard while the prosecutor and his daughter were in your house? A. There were showers - it was not a continued rain, for I went out to see; it rained a little when they left: I did not know Austin, but understood he worked for Captain Lewis, opposite my house; the first time I saw him at my house was the night before - I know he has absconded, because the officers were sent after him; I heard the Magistrate order them to search for him - I believe it was neither of the officers that are here; he had a cap on on Sunday and Monday, and Haygreen had a cap - I had seen him and Haygreen sit down, and should judge they were nearly of the same height, and about the same stoutness.</p>

            , of the ship Royalist, his share of oil at 70l. per ton, if he should be entitled to more than 70l. per ton, the balance I promise to pay. JOHN PESMAN.</p>
               <p>I do not know what became of the bill of sale; I was drunk, and was compelled to sign it - all the prisoners were there at the time; I do not know who said any thing about the cheque - Pesman gave a cheque on the Bank; I did not see it to my recollection - my landlord told me of it; Sullivan went to the Bank with Forbes, and I was kept a prisoner all the time - (cheque read) "For 44l. 6s. 6d. on Sir William Curtis and Co., signed J. Pesman." Sullivan and Forbes went with it; I was Serjeant's prisoner at the time - Pesman and Quixley were there; when Forbes and Sullivan came back they reckoned the money on the table - a bill was then made out against me, of 7l. 13s., due to Colvin, and 1l. 5s. for the writ; I paid that and was set at liberty - I afterwards applied at Pesman's for the balance of my money; I cannot tell exactly when it might be - in the course of a week or two, I went to his house in Wapping; he began to kick up a row with me at his own door; he said he would not give any more money, as the oil had not been sold for any such price - Quixley drew this receipt and Colvin signed to it.</p>

            ; this is the signature I swore was not mine - I was before the Lord Mayor; I was not sober - I was sworn and examined, but did not well know what I was saying; I do not know how long I was being examined, perhaps half and hour - I did say, before the Lord Mayor, that I owed Colvin for waterage and porterage; I cannot say whether I said Pesman and Colvin had come on board the ship at Gravesend - I cannot say whether I did mention the porterate and waterage, but I know that is all I owed Colvin; I formerly, lived at Colvin's for five weeks, but did not promise him I would go to his house again after the voyage - I did not intend to go there; I gave him 1l. 7s. 6d. and I paid him 4l. 10s. at Gravesend.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you pay the 1l. 7s. 6d.? A. About five years ago, when I was going to the Coast of Peru - I gave him the other money on board the ship between decks, down by the starboard side.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How often have you seen Mr. Isaacs? A. Several times; not at his own house, but some place in the country - I went down to a farm-house; I shall not swear in what part of the country - Mr. Isaacs. paid my expences down, and I was there three months; I cannot tell how often he visited me - I cannot tell whether he has been down twenty times talking about this business.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name of the place where the farmhouse is? A. I do not know the name of the town.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far is it from town? A. That I cannot tell neither - I went in a coach; I suppose I was about four hours going - I did not know Isaacs before I went to the Mansion-house, but I believe he is the best friend I have got in London - we have not been conversing about what I was to swear at this trial; he merely came down to see how my health was getting on- we drank together, and he paid; the landlord's name was James Hall - he has a farm, and keeps a public-house; it was the public-house I was at - the sign of the George and Dragon; I do not remember the name of the coach I went by - Isaacs did not go with me; he told me to stop at Mr. Hall's, but I do not know the name of the town - the coachman took me to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. You swear you do not know the name of the town? A. No, I do not swear it; it was in a village.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You are upon your oath, do not you know the name of the village where you wereliving - what County was it in? A. Essex, I believe; I cannot tell you the name of the town - I never inquired.</p>

               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What was the name of the place? A. Brentwood; that is what I heard them say - I never saw any market there - there was a fair there once.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not know the name of the town all through the examination? A. I cannot swear to that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Colvin. Q. Did you say you gave me 4l. 10s. when you went out to Peru? A. Yes - I came out of the cabin, took two months in advance, and gave you 4l. 10s; you took the money, went on shore, and bought me a pair of trousers and 3lbs. of soap out of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Colvin. He ran away from the ship, and I paid 3l. out of the money to a man for him; he was naked when I took him in, and he confessed before the Lord Mayor that he owed me 7l. 13s. Witness. I said I owed him something.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Why did you sign that paper by the name of Williams? A. I went to the office with Serjeant, from the Mitre, to overhaul the ship's articles - I could not find my own name in the articles, and I signed that in the room of my own name.</p>

            . I lived at No. 2, Bremer's-court, Gravel-lane. Rees came to live with me on the 22nd of March - he continued there till the 25th, except when he went out occasionally, and eat and drank at my house. On the 25th Forbes and Colvin came - when I went down they were at the door; they asked if Rees was at home- I said No, he did not sleep there that night; I was talking to Colvin, whom I had known for some time, and Rees came down from Ratcliff-highway - Colvin pointed to Rees, and said, "Forbes, there is the man, I give charge of him - I have nothing more to do with him;" he then went away - Forbes asked him if he had had his breakfast; he said No, and he desired him, being his prisoner, to get his breakfast as soon he could - when he had done breakfast he ordered him out into the street; I accompanied him - I did not hear what passed between Forbes and Rees till we got to the Mitre; except that Forbes told him to walk with me and one or two more for fear of disgracing him, being known there; we got to the Mitre, where they called for liquor freely, and treated every body there - the others came in; the Mitre is about a mile from my house, near Aldgate-street - we went into the tap-room, where they called for the beer and gin; Rees drank, and so did Forbes - I was quite sober; nothing passed between Forbes and Rees till the others came - we were conveyed into the parlour by Pesman Quixley, and the others; when Pesman came, he said;" What is this business about?" Forbes said that Rees was taken prisoner; they asked Colvin if he had his bill- he said No, but he could make it out by word of month; I cannot say which of them it was that asked the question- Serjeant made out the bill; this is it - Pesman asked Rees if he would sell his voyage, his share of oil; he said No, he would not - I then offered myself, and another housekeeper, as bail till the ship was paid; Colvin refused, and swore he would have they money - I then told Rees to go to gaol, and said I would see him provided with every thing he wanted till the ship was paid; Rees said he thought it was a very hard case, after being at sea for thirty-two months and four days, to go to gaol for a debt he never contracted - Pesman then said he had better come to a settlement with Colvin, and he would give him 44l. 6s. 6d. for his share of oil; he asked what share of oil he had - he said, two tons and three barrels - Pesman told him not to mind the three barrels, as they would be little enough to make up the three tons, for there had been an alteration in the measure since he left London; he agreed to give 70l. a ton for his share of oil, and if it came to more he should have the balance - Rees said he would not accept of it; he said he would give him 44l. 6s. 6d. if the oil sold for 70l. a ton, and if it sold for more he would pay him the balance -Rees was unwilling to sell till he got a little in his heard, which was apparent to the five persons present, or to any person who saw him; when he got a little more, he agreed to sell it for 44l. 6s. 6d. sooner than to go to gaol -Quixley wrote this paper - he said it was better to come to a conclusion, and to walk about like the rest of his shipmates, than to be confined; Pesman then made out a cheque for 44l. 6s. 6d. - I did not look at it particularly; I only just folded it up; Forbes and myself then went to the banker's, and received the money leaving the prosecutor in custody - I had the check; I returned, and found Rees in custody of Colvin - I counted the money to Rees on the table; Rees signed a paper before I went- they did not explain it, but folded it up in a narrow compass, and Rees signed his name at the bottom; it was a large paper, and folded - there was no writing on it that Rees could see; I looked at it while he was writing -Pesman then produced a blank receipt; I do not know whether there was any stamp to it - he asked Rees to sign his name to it; I said he should not sign it till I knew the contents - he said he wanted it to draw the amount of the wages from the owners, and it was of no consequence; he then made Rees sign his name to it - he signed his name William Williams; he was able to walk home, and that was all - Quixley said the receipt was of no cousequence; he might sign his name to it, it was no harm - this was before I went to the Bank for the money; when I brought the money Rees counted out 7l. 13s., the amount he was arrested for, as he thought - Forbes would not accept of it till 1l. 5s. was paid for the writ; it was Serjeant who put down 1l. 5s. for expences - Rees then gave them nine sovereigns, and they gave him 1s. out; Quixley wrote a receipt, and Colvin signed his name to it - this is the receipt, it is for 7l. 13s.; they did not give any receipt for the 1l. 5s. - no person asked for it; he was then at liberty; in the course of a little time I went with Rees to Pesman's, and asked if there was any balance coming to him - he told him not to come bothering him about it, for after all the money he had given him, he never came to lay out 1l. at his shop - he desired him to walk out of his shop; he keeps a slop-shop, in High-street, Wapping - none of the other parties were then present; there were some sailors there - to the best of my judgment, when Rees signed this paper he was not in a condition to know what he was about, he was in such a ter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100164"/>ror and in such a fright - he was in liquor, and his mind in trouble besides.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober? A. I expect so - I had drank both heer and gin after going to the Mitre; Rees, Forbes, Colvin, Serjeant,

             and I, drank - I saw Rees sign the receipt in the name of Williams; I saw him take the pen, but I was not near enough to see the way he wrote it - he wrote William Williams; I did not see it read.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why do you say he wrote William Williams? A. Because he was expected to do so.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How many papers did he sign? A. I have not heard what he has sworn here, but he signed two papers - we passed by Pesman's shop in going to the Mitre; I did not state so before the Lord Mayor - I do not know a man by the name of Levy; I may know his face.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know that man? (a person was here pointed out to the witness) A. No, I never saw him, to my knowledge before; I do not know a man of the name of Moss - I have seen that man (another person) frequently before; I never asked him to buy the oil on behalf of Rees nor to advance any money upon the oil - I never saw Moss in company with Rees before the day we were at the Mitre; he was in and out - he was not there the whole time; he had nothing to do with the business -Rees did not, in my presence, ask Moss to get Levy to advance money on this oil; nor leave the Mitre, in my presence, with Moss, to go to Levy, to see if he would advance money on his share - he went to overhaul the ship's articles, to see about his name; that was the intention with which he left the house - they made an advance as his name has been scratched out by the captain, as there was a man left at St. Helen, and the captain said he should go by that man's name; Moss did not tell me that he was Mr. Levy's clerk - this bill was drawn out for Colvin; I did not say that Quixley wrote it; all I said was that Quickly wrote the two receipts - not that Quixley wrote the bill by Colvin's desire; to the best of my knowledge I never expressed that word - Rees boarded and lodged with me for thirteen weeks, and then I got tired of him; Mr. Isaacs took him and sent him into the country, for fear he should be tampered with by this party - he did not tell me what part of the country; I have no idea where it was - I have seen Mr. Isaacs; he told me to tell the truth, and that I always will do - Rees appeared to me to he sober at the Mansion-house: he might be in terror - to the best of my opinion he had only one glass of liquor, but I had not been with him all the morning - the sale of the oil was on the 25th of March, and I think in April we went to the Mansion-house; he went to recover his own rights - I did not hear him tell the Lord Mayor that he had not a stick to cover him, tell the Lord Mayor that he had not a stick to cover him, nor a farthing in the world; the money was not spent when he went - I can swear I had more than two sovereigns of his money to take care of; he would not want for a meal if I had it, if he was never to pay me for it - Mr. Isaacs brought an action against the owner of the ship for this very oil by Rees's direction; I know they brought the action for the whole of the oil - the Sheriff's officer arrested him for the whole amount; I did not go for Quixley and Pesman from the Mitre - I do not know that any one did; I did not know them, and cannot tell whether they frequent the Mitre or not; Quixley did say, that if in case Rees was entitled to more than 70l. a ton, and left the receipt with me, I could get it, but he did not say from whom - I cannot say whether Moss was present or not; Colvin was bailed - I do not know whether the others were required to give bail.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Colvin. The day after the ship came into the London-docks, I went down to this man, and he said, if we can get him to sell his wages, we will, for he has been arrested for a suit of clothes, and I do not know how I shall get my money - Sullivan took him out of my house to his house, and I went there. Witness. I never did; I saw Colvin the day Rees came on shore - he was quite drunk, and when he saw me he began shedding tears for joy, at seeing me.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. At the time you saw Colvin with Rees, did Colvin say any thing about any debt? A. No, he went and got a pot of beer - we drank it, and then Rees went home to my house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Colvin. Q. Did I not mention it to you the day after, and you said, I should get my money? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Upon the oath you have taken, did you know Colvin claimed any debt before the morning Rees was taken? A. Upon my oath I did not - Rees did tell me, that morning, that he owed him a trifle, but he did not say what.</p>

No; many of the others about there get their living by getting sailors to lodge - there is nothing particular in getting sailors; I have known Serjeant ten or twelve years - he has been in and out of my house, and I have had goods of him; Serjeant has been a sailor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. You have told my friend you have seen the names Pesman and Quixley on the door? A. I have - the house is let out to different lodgers; there is another person lives up stairs - Pesman and Quixley's names are written, up separately, one on one side and and one on the other.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was Forbes behind the counter or no? A. I did not particular notice - I never heard any thing to the contrary, but that Colvin was an honest man; there are two windows to the shop, one on each side the door -I cannot tell whether they are in partnership; Harris is constantly there - there is but one door, and there is no other name but Pesman and Quixley: neither of them live there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has not Rees instructed you to bring an action against the owner of the Royalist for the entire amount of his share of the oil? A. Yes; I have arrested him for the whole sum - I cannot tell how much money I have paid for Rees; they have not sent me in the bill from the public-house - I never drank with him there; I never conversed with him on the evidence he was to give here - my clerk took down his evidence; I never did - I have been down to Brentwood on business, but never saw him; I saw him four or five times in the three months - my clerk paid his coach-here; I told my clerk to send him down to Mr. Halls, at Brentwood - I may have paid 15l. or 16l.; I will not swear I have not paid 30l. - I will swear I have not paid 50l.: I have his cause in hand, and I expect to get it - that will re-pay me; it was by my advice that he brought the action against Mr. Smith.</p>

            . I am a clerk to Mr. Isaacs. I went in March to the King's Bench to the Filazer's office, and to every public office where I thought a process could be issued by Colvin against Rees - I found no bill nor any serviceable process.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Were you present at the Mansion-house? A. Yes; Rees was like other sailors - he had been out passing the morning, but he appeared to give his evidence as a sober man; I took him from the Grand Jury room, as he was walking in the street, to the Spread Eagle, Gracechurch-street, and took him by the Norwich coach to Brentwood; I staid with him from the Friday till the Sunday - I did not tell him the name of the place; I cannot tell whether he knew it - I went to him there three times; I have drank in the same room he was sitting in - I paid for myself; the liquor he drank, the people who were there paid, he being a sailor; I did not write to him while he was there; I have conversed with him about his evidence here several times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have heard his evidence this morning - does he appear more competent to give his evidence now than he did at the Mansion-house? A. Yes; more so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Colvin. I said I had no money, and he turned round, and said, "If you will turn evidence against the master, it will be something in your way. Witness. No, I did not - I was sent for; I saw him in a very destitute state: he said, "What am I to do?" I said,</p>

             re-examined. Q. Which room were they in when you went for the money? A. In the back parlour - there was no other person there that I took notice of; we had the drink in the tap-room - they had no drink in the parlour, unless it was while I was gone for the money- the agreement was made in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. When Pesman and Quixley first came, where were you? A. In the taproom - we were there a quarter of an hour, while they were going backwards and forwards to overhaul his name; he had stated that he was entitled to two tons and three barrels of oil, before they went into the parlour.</p>
               <p>Colvin's Defence. I am innocent. I kept the man when he was in distress; this man never kept him, only when he found he had a little money - I only received 4l. 10s. of him, and he had no clothes.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Levy and Co. of Leadenhall-street - the Royalist was paid off there by Mr. Smith. the owner, about the 19th or 20th of April - it generally happens that the men have advances made - about three weeks generally elapse before the company are paid - the parties who have made advances attend when the ship's company are paid; I have known parties receive the whole of the sailors money; I was not in the counting-house at the time the Royalist was paid, but I was in the warehouse adjoining - I did not see Rees. I was at the Mitre on the day in question; I went about ten o'clock in the morning for change; while I was getting change, Colvin came out of the tap-room, and said there was a sailor of the Royalist there who wanted an advance, and asked me if Mr.Levy would make the advance - I said No, he would not; I said immediately, "Why don't you go to Pesman's or Quixley's, as they are in the habit of advancing money to the people;" he said No, he would rather Mr. Levy would do it, but he might go over, and see - I then left; I went there again about eleven o'clock, with a friend; while in the parlour, Pesman and Quixley came in - Pesman asked me if there was any sailor of the Royalist there; I said there had been some there about ten o'clock - Pesman then went out, and Quixley remained -Pesman returned in two or three minutes with Colvin, Rees, and one or two others. in sailor's dresses - Quixley turned round, and said to Rees, "Well, my man, what countryman are you?" he said, a Welchman - Quixley said, "I think you are an Irishman; before I can make you any advance, you must go over to Mr. Levy's, to see whether you belong to the ship;" Quixley, Rees, and his lodging-house keeper then left, and returned in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; Quixley then said the man belonged to the ship - he had pointed out his name - they sat down at an opposite table; I and my friend got up to leave the place; Quixley asked me if I would be kind enough to witness the payment of the money - I staid a few minutes; the man was complaining that he wanted a greater advance - Quixley said, "I shall not think of advancing you more till such time as your ship is paid, as dont know how it will turn out; the price of oil has fluctuated very much;" Quixley said,</p>
               <p>"You are not compelled to take it, and I shall advise you to wait till the ship is paid;" but he said he must have money, as he wanted to go to Liverpool; he said, "Let's have it;" Quixley then wrote the receipt, Pesman this cheque, and Rees signed the receipt - this is it: after that, Pesman, Quixley, and my friend left the house - there was a memorandum given, just as I came away, that if the oil sold for 75l. a ton, he should receive the benefit of it; the whole cargo has been sold at 70l. a ton - the expenses of the voyage are to be deducted from that; I was present during the whole of the transaction, till Pesman and I left - I think Pesman made an advance; I saw no other paper signed by Rees but the receipt - I am positive of that - if Rees had attended at my house at the time the ship was paid, he would have received his money.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you attend before the Lord<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182909100166"/>Mayor? A. Yes; I was asked if I knew any thing about it, and I said what I have stated - I did not say I knew nothing about it; I have known Pesman and Quixley these three years - they are partners in some transactions, not as slop-sellers that I know of; Forbes is not in their employ to my knowledge - Pesman and Quixley have not applied to my employers for this to my knowledge; the prosecutor is entitled to the one hundred and fortieth share of the net proceeds of the one hundred and fortieth share of the net proceeds of the cargo, but I do not know what they are; I was not at any time in the tap-room; I do not know what passed there: I did not see a hill of sale signed, I think if it had been I should have seen it; I did not see a folded paper given to him to sign; he appeared sober; I do not know that he was in custody; Forbes was there when Pesman and Quixley were - I heard nothing about custody; if it had passed I think I should have heard it; Colvin was there - I heard nothing about 7l. 13s. - I do not know where Pesman and Quixley went to, they parted in Aldgate; Sullivan was there - I did not hear one word about any claim made upon Rees by Colvin - Sergeant was there, I have seen him repeatedly - I did not know what he was; I do not know what a crimp means; I do not know that Colvin is a depuly crimp, he is a waterman; I have been agent to Mr. Smith about twelve years - I do not know what a crimp means, unless it be to follow seamen to take orders from them for clothes; Pesman and Quixley are in partnership as crimps certainly - I do not know that Colvin is a deputy crimp in their service - I do not know that Forbes is a crimp in their service; I have been at their place five hundred times; I have not seen him there twenty times; they have three shops, I never saw Forbes behind Quixley's counter; Mr. Levy supplies Pesman and Quixley with slops - I get no commission when they receive money.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Have you heard the word crimps applied to persons who get recruits for the army? A. Yes; when a bill of sale is given for a man's interest in a cargo, it is usual for a copy of it to be sent in and lodged with the agent - no such copy was sent to Mr. Levy in this instance.</p>

            . I am a ship's husband. I have known Pesman ten or a dozen years; it is the practice of the trade, when a bill of sale is made, to lodge it with the agent - without that the agent takes the money.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. If the sailor does not accompany him, the person does not get paid? A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose a person produced a receipt on account of so much of a share of oil, would you not pay that? A. Yes certainly; if the sailor desires they frequently leave a note.</p>

             not to pay Pesman, and threatening me with an action - that is the only notice I have received.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then the share is wholly unpaid? A. Mr. Smith paid something in the Court; the whole proceeds of the cargo was 14040l., his share is 100l. 5s. 8l. - the set off is 31l. 12s. 9d.; the amount due to him 68l. 12s. 11d. - Mr. Jacobs afterwards called on me on the part of Mr. Isaacs, and asked if I would pay this balance to the man; I said I was not certain we should have the payment of the ship, but I would recommend the owners to withhold payment of the balance, till this matter was settled - on the 19th of April, Pesman called to know when the ship would be paid; I said what is this occurrence? I have received a notice so and so; he stated that the parties intended to defrand him of a large sum of money, which he had advanced - that was the only reply he made; sometime after they lodged an attachment in the hands of the owner, for the amount of this man's share, which I bailed - then they withdrew that, and commenced an action for his share.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the action against you settled? A. No, I believe not.</p>

On Saturday. the 15th of August, I went out at half-past eleven o'clock in the morning - there are no lodgers; it is a small house, with two rooms and a kitchen; I locked my door, and saw two bad boys throwing stones; I turned back, and put my shutters too - my children were at that time at school, and no one was in the house; I locked my door very particularly, and when I came home at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, I met my little boy, who had come home from school; he said to me,"How came you to leave your window open;" I went to the house, and found the window was open, and the curtain torn down; the parlour door was wide open - my drawers were open, and the property stated was gone; the person had got in by pulling open the shutters, and lifting up the window, which was down, and fastened by a latch. I found my property at a pawnbroker's on the Monday - I know the prisoner, and knew his father; they did live three or four doors from my house, but they had moved a short time before; his father is a watchman.</p>
