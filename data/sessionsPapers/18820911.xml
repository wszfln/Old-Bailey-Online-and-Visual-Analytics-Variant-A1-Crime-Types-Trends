I live at 2, Orchard Street, Ball's Pond—on Saturday night, the 29th of July, I saw Henry Godden at the Duke of York public-house, Kingsland—he was drunk and leaning on the table when I went into the bar about 11 p.m.—I stopped with him to the concert, and helped him home—it was about 12.5 when I took him upstairs—the other <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> who helped me stopped at the top of Mildmay Avenue—when I put him on the bed he was drunk and insensible—I came away, and talked to a neighbour about 10 minutes—I saw a crowd—I stopped with Henry Godden about 5 minutes—I did not take his handkerchief off.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Hudig and Pieters, of Rotterdam—they have a receiving office at Rotterdam, a few minutes' walk from the place where the Great Eastern steamships are moored—I have been in their service seven or eight yean—I know the last witness, Van Baalen, as a person employed by Van Gend and Loos to bring parcels to our office to be forwarded by the company—it is the practice to bring to our office a paper like that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), to be filled up by us—the parcels are brought with that form and I sign a temporary receipt, that is the usual custom—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the consignment note left with the parcel on the day that bears date, 12th July—I received the parcels mentioned in it—they would be forwarded by steamship to London—they were two, both addressed to Mercier, Backhouse, and Co., 3, Copthall Buildings, London, E. C.—one was marked "Value 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and the other "Value 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—I compared them with that paper—I remember Catella making out a list of the parcels on that day for the captain; I think I called out the names, addresses, and particulars of two of the parcels to him, but not the rest—in the ordinary course after Catella had made out the list of the parcels, and the particulars for the captain, they would be delivered to H. Degens, and he would take them to the ship—I saw Degens take four parcels away, one paper parcel, and two grey canvas parcels, and another in grey canvas—that was about half-past 5 in the afternoon.</p>

"—that was done in Mr. Pieters' office when the parcels were there—at the office I got this pencil list of those six things; I always made a practice to take a list of the things I have to carry, to check them—we have a box on purpose to put manifests, bills of lading, and all papers in—papers relating to the parcels would be put into that box and delivered at Harwich—after I got this list I went straight on board the vessel, and I gave it to the chief steward, and left it with him—properly speaking the steward ought to have checked the things with the list—after I had given him the list I went on shore again once or twice—I know a man named Degens—I passed him on that afternoon carrying some parcels under his arms similar to those I had seen in the office; he was going on board—he was near the ship on the gangway—afterwards I saw nothing more of the parcels; the ship sailed about six o'clock—it is eleven or twelve hours passing in fine weather—when we got to Harwich Mr. Gunton, the bullion clerk, came on board—there were passengers by the vessel; I can't say how many—the passengers left—Mr. Gunton is employed by the Great Eastern Railway to receive the bullion and valuable parcels—when he came aboard I handed him this pencil memorandum relating to these six parcels, and told the steward to fetch the parcels while he entered them in my book, and then I found that three of them were missing—the box and bag of money were there—the place was thoroughly searched, and the other parcels could not be found.</p>

               <p>and a few minutes before 10 I saw Carr go into No. 3, the office of Messrs. Mercier—he was carrying a small brown paper parcel—I afterwards saw him come out carrying apparently the same parcel; he went into Copthall Court—at the same time as he came out of No. 3, Wilson left the public-house suddenly—he had been in the same compartment as myself—he came in while I was waiting, as soon as Carr went to No. 3; he had a parcel, very much like the other one, only a little different in size—while he was there he was apparently watching towards No. 3 which drew my attention to him more than ever; that was while Carr was in No, 3—when Carr came out of No. 3, Wilson left suddenly and ran and overtook Carr, and they stood and had a little conversation in the court—they each had a parcel, they wore standing as close as they could, facing each other, for a minute or two—I could not tell whether anything was passed between them or not, Wilson's back was towards me—Carr then left Wilson and went back to No. 3 with a parcel, and Wilson went away carrying a parcel—I followed Carr to the house; I saw nothing more of Wilson then—on bank-holiday, 7th August, about 11, I saw Wilson in a tram-car in the Peckham Road—I got into the car and rode with him to Camberwell Road—I there stopped the car and said to him, "Mr. Wilson, I wish to speak to you"—he turned round and said, "What do you want?"—I said, "If you will get outside I will tell you all about it"—he got out, and I then told him that I was an officer of the City Police, and said, "I shall take you into custody for being concerned with John Carr, in custody, for the unlawful possession of foreign bonds "—he said, "I don't know John Carr, nor anything at all about any bonds"—I told him he would have to go with me to the City—he said, "Very well"—I brought him to the City and he was charged—the charge was road over to him by the inspector—he replied, "That is mere <hi rend="italic">bosh,</hi> waste paper that it is written on, all folly"—to my recollection I never saw Wilson before the day I saw him with Carr—I have known Carr by sight about four or five years living in this country.</p>

I was waiting at the Shepherd and Mock about an hour before I saw Carr—I was sitting down on a stool in the bar right opposite the door—any one sitting in the bar could see down Copthall Buildings, and could see No. 3—I was sitting about a yard or a yard and a half from the door of the public-house—there are two doors with straps to them, they do not quite close, and you could see through and see the whole of Copthall Buildings—there was no one with Carr when I first saw him—Wilson came into the public-house directly Carr had gone into No. 3—I could only see that Wilson came from the corner, he did not come straight up Copthall Court; he must have come down a court that leads out of London Wall; he had three of brandy neat—he did not sit down, he sipped it, and went right in front of me looking out at the door, and I looked over his shoulder—he stood there three, four, or five minutes, till Carr came out of No. 3; when he came out he turned to the right, away from where I was sitting, away from the public-house—Wilson at the same time went out and I followed him, and they met just at the corner, as Carr was turning to the left, I did not see him turn round—the parcel Wilson was carrying might have gone into a great-coat pocket—when I took Wilson into custody he did not say, "I do not know anything about John Carr's business; he said, "I don't know John Carr, nor anything about John Carr, nor anything about any bonds.

I live at 51, Victoria Road, Kilburn, and am an articled clerk in the City—on a Saturday night in August I went with Mr. Bebro to the Criterion at 8 or 8.30—I had two sovereigns and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. loose in my trousers pocket—I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to the cabman—Mr. Bebro met two male friends, one of whom paid for the dinner, and I paid for a bottle of wine; I don't know what—I was sober when I went there—I don't know what time we left; I remember leaving—I don't know what money I spent there; I picked up the change and put it in my pocket without counting it—I went out with the intention of getting into a cab and going home, but have not a faint recollection of anything which occurred till I was woke up on Sunday morning by Bebro, and found myself in bed with him and the two female prisoners, we were all four in one bed—I looked at my watch, and it was 2. 15 a. m.—I had not wound my watch up, but it had not stopped—Bebro was then dressing—I asked him where I was—he said 2, Westmoreland Street, as he had seen the address on a telegram—I was undressed; I got out of bed and dressed myself, and we were then both going towards the door, when Moore said "How about a fiver?"—I said "What fiver?"—she said "You promised us a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I said I had no recollection of anything of the kind or of getting there—she said "Well, you won't go out of this place till you give it us"—she then got out of bed, put on a dressing gown, went to the door and locked it, and put the key in her pocket—put my hand in my pocket and only found 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I told her I had no money—Vincent then got out of bed, and sat on a sofa or chair—Moore said "Nell, ring the bell, I will see what these b——s are made of"—Vincent rang the bell; I heard footsteps at the door; Moore unlocked it, and the two male prisoners came in—Moore said to Tucker "These b——s have come here, him, and are going away without paying us after promising us a fiver"—Tucker said "Come, out with it, or I will chuck you out of the b——window "—we were both standing about the centre of the room, and the window was a little open—Tucker said to Remington "Shut the door"—Remington shut it, and stood with his hand on the side of it the whole time, and his back to the wall—Tucker said "Now, then, tip up, you b——, I have no time for this b——<hi rend="italic">parley</hi>" and kept tapping my pockets—he said "I will kill you and throw you out at the window—I kept backing towards the window—I said "I have no money; it is impossible for you to get it; only let me go and I will send you what you like when I get away"—he said "That is no good; I must have it now, or I will throw you out of the b—</p>

"—I believe it was worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he turned to Bebro and said "Now, then, out with yours"—he said "I have got no watch"—Tucker said "Then let us have your chain"—Bebro took his chain off and gave it to him; he was decidedly in a state of fright; we are both very young—Tucker then said "Give us an 10 U for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or a note of hand"—the servant came into the room, and Tucker said to her "Go and get some paper," and she fetched it, and Tucker put it on the table and said "You b——, write what I tell you"—I was going to write a note of hand—I wrote "The." for my name, and then I stoutly refused, and told him I would not do it, and put the paper on the table; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Tucker said to Bebro "Now, then, you b——, you do it, if you don't I will turn you up and throw you out of the window"—Bebro wrote, at his dictation, "Left a watch and chain value 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in care of Mr. Tucker, 2, Westmoreland Street—Thos. Smith"—it is not his usual writing—Tucker said "What shall we do with the b——s?"—Remington said "Well, if the poor fellows have not got anything you can't get it"—Tucker said, pointing to Moore, "If that little <hi rend="italic">bitch</hi> had been drunk she would have torn your b—eyes out; and if I had been drunk I would have stripped your clothes off your backs"—he then said to Remington "Oh! we have got half a gallon of six ale in the house"—they brought it up and pressed us both to drink—I just put my lips to it, but neither of us drank—I told Remington he deserved something for the manner he had spoken, and Tucker said "He is new at the job; now show the b——s out"—both the servants and Remington went down and let us out, and Tucker followed Remington—the four prisoners were in the room the whole of the time—Remington said nothing to prevent this going on—I spoke to a constable outside the house, and we both returned with him, and two constables took Tucker to the station—he was not taken, he came with us—I told the inspector what had occurred—he asked Tucker for the watch and chain, and he gave them up—I asked the inspector what I should charge them with; he refused to tell me, and the inspector handed back the watch and chain to him—on the Monday morning I sent a cabman to a public-house in the neighbourhood, as I was afraid to go myself—I stopped outside, and Tucker came out with him—I did not get the watch and chain—I afterwards obtained a warrant—the two women were taken first—I afterwards saw Tucker driving in Holborn, and gave him in charge.</p>

On 26th August I went with Mr. Matthews to the Criterion—we got there about 8.30, and met some friends, who paid for dinner—we had champagne, and beer, and port, and were intoxicated when we left—I only had two or three shillings when I went there, not intending to go there when I left home—I have a faint recollection of speaking to some women and of getting into a Hansom cab, and the next thing I recollect is finding myself in bed with Matthews and the two female prisoners—I woke up first; I was half undressed—I awoke Matthews, who said "Don't bother me; where am I?"—I did not know where I was, but I found a telegram on the shelf addressed to 2, Westmoreland Street—I told Matthews of that—he got up, and when we were dressed and were leaving the room, Moore, I think it was, said "How about the <hi rend="italic">fiver?"</hi>—Matthews said "I don't know about any <hi rend="italic">fiver</hi> at all"—Moore said "Well, then, you don't go out of this house without you give us the money"—she got out of bed, put on a dressing-gown, stood by the door, turned the key, and put it in her pocket—Vincent got out of bed and went to the sofa—I walked towards the door to get out, and Moore said" King the bell, <hi rend="italic">Poll</hi>"—Vincent rang the bell, and the servant, I fancy it was, came up—I do not know whether Moore spoke to the servant or not, but I heard footsteps outside, and Moore opened the door, and Tucker and Remington came in, and one of them said "What is all this row; about?"—Moore said "These b——s won't give us any money"—Tucker said "I want no humbug; if you don't give us the money I shall shake you up and throw you out at the window"—Matthews said "I have got no money, and you can't get blood out of a stone"—Tucker said "I will kill you, and throw you out at that window," and he tapped Matthews's pockets and pushed us towards the window—I was very much afraid, I knew we were very high from the ground—one of the women said "They have got watches and chains, <hi rend="italic">Jim"</hi> and Tucker said to Matthews "Out with that watch, or I will shake you up; I will kill you"—Matthews said "For God's sake leave mo alone, I have got no money, and you can't get blood out of a stone"—Tucker said "Then we will have he watch"—after a little time Matthews gave up his watch, and Tucker said "That is no good; it is only worth 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., "and Tucker then said to me "Out with your watch"—I said "I have not got a watch, only my chain," and gave it up—he knocked my hands down; they were on my chain—he then said "These things are not worth much; now give us a note of hand for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or von won't get your things, and I will certainly throw you out of the window—he sent for pen and paper, and said to Matthews "Now, take hold</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Little Payne Street, Barnsbury, and am the widow of Richard Carroll, who was a coal carman, about 32 years of age—on Saturday evening, 19th August, he was brought home from his work about 7, complaining of pains in his head and back, and of being very hot; he remained at home and rested on the Sunday—I know Dr. Kane's dispensary in Copenhagen Street; I went there on the Monday, about 12 o'clock, the prisoner opened the door and said, "Come inside," and I went inside the parlour and sat down and said, "Please can you come to my husband at once?"—I did not see anybody else there—he said he would be there about one—he did not come, and I went down to him again at 6—I said to him, "How is it you have not been to my husband?"—he said, "I made a mistake in the number of the street"—I said, "Then can you come now?" and he followed me to the house—he saw my husband in bed and took hold of his pulse, and tried his head—he said his head was very hot, and that he would get him well in three or four days, as all he wanted was a good scouring out—he told me to go down to his house for the medicine—I did so the same evening soon after the prisoner got down there; he gave it to me—there were directions on the bottle that it was to be taken once every four hours—I gave it to my husband in that way, till the contents of the bottle were gone; it lasted till 7 next evening—it had a strong effect on my husband, it seemed to work him very much; I believe it worked him eight times—on Tuesday afternoon he seemed a little bit livelier, but in the evening, he seemed to get weak and lightheaded, as if he was mad—I saw the prisoner again at 2 o'clock on. Tuesday, before the first medicine was finished—he asked my husband how he felt; he said he was much better, but be was getting worse—the prisoner came again on the Wednesday. about 2 o'clock—my husband seemed no better then—he told the prisoner he felt better, he said so all along, but he said his appetite was very bad he could not eat, and that he could get no rest—on Thursday he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188209110035"/>
               <p>again at 2 o'clock, and my husband was sitting in the chair against the door—I believe he was up on the Wednesday sitting in an armchair when the doctor came, and on Thursday he insisted on getting up—the doctor said, "How are you to-day?"—he said, "I am all right, governor, I feel all right"—"Well," he said, "I think you are far from being right, and you must go into bed, or else I cannot attend you," and he walked out of the room—that was the only time I knew him tell my husband to get into bed—on the Thursday evening I went down for his medicine—my husband went to bed directly after the prisoner told him, but I had a hard job to make him do so, because he would insist on getting out of bed—on the Thursday afternoon he had a little milk, and I believe a herring for his tea; I gave it to him, he sat at the table—I had had another bottle of medicine on the Tuesday evening, which was to be taken every four hours, and that lasted till the Wednesday, when I went and had another bottle—it seemed still to work him, to open his inside and make him as mad in his head—when I went for the medicine on Thursday I said to the prisoner, "I must <hi rend="italic">go</hi> to the House"—he only said, "Well, I should"—on Friday morning my husband seemed much worse and very helpless, he could not move, and I went down to the parish doctor with a parish order, and Dr. Round tree came to him between 12 and I—he examined him and told me he was dying, and on that day at ten minutes past 5 he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner did not say he was Dr. Kane, and I did not ask him—I do not know if there is a name over the dispensary; I cannot read—my husband never came home drunk; he had a heavy day's work on the Saturday—the prisoner asked him on the Monday if he had been drinking lately; my husband said he had had a glass, but he never made it a practice of getting drunk—he did not say what ho had had a glass of—he complained of pain in his head; I did not hear him say anything to the prisoner about a pain in his back—I told the prisoner when I went for him on the Monday that he had pains in his back and head, and was very hot; he was quite rational when the prisoner saw him on the Monday; he could talk all along quite clearly—I did not hear him say anything about the pains in his back—the prisoner looked at his tongue on the Monday, and said he should think his inside was in a dreadful state with drink, and my husband told him he had been having a glass, but he never knew his inside was in such a state with drink—I noticed his tongue and lips was in a very bad state—I began to give him the medicine about eight on the Monday; I stopped up till about twelve and gave him another dose, and I woke in the morning about seven and gave him another dose—he was up the bet part of the night and took the medicine himself at the hours he ought to—when the prisoner came on the Tuesday there was a person in the room upstairs overhead; on the Monday I was there by myself—the water-closet is down stairs close by the wash-house; you have to go outside the house to get to it—my husband went three or four times to the water-closet on the Monday night; he put on his clothes and boots—when the prisoner came the next day, about two o'clock, he said he would give him some medicine to make him sleep, so that he should have a good night's rest—my husband complained of not being able to sleep, and I complained that he was so light-headed I could not keep him indoors—the medicine I fetched on Tuesday looked a little different from that I had fetched</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188209110036"/>
               <p>on Monday, and I understood it was for the purpose of giving him a good night's rest—I fetched it about 7.30 both on Wednesday and Thursday; my husband told me he felt better; he seemed livelier one minute and the next minute would lose all his senses—he seemed better to me on Tuesday when the prisoner came—on the Wednesday he was up and dressed; he finished a bottle of medicine a day—the first medicine acted as an aperient; he had no other medicine like that—I told the prisoner on the Wednesday evening my husband's bowels were bound—on Friday morning I went for the parish doctor, and when I came back I asked a neighbour to go down and tell the prisoner I had sent for the parish doctor, and I should not want him to call any more—the prisoner did not tell me on the Wednesday or Thursday that my husband wanted some good nourishment—my husband asked me if he might have a glass of beer—I asked the prisoner, and the prisoner said he thought he had better have a little milk; my husband had three half-pints of milk—I told the prisoner on the Thursday night that my husband was not getting any better, and I should have to go and get a parish doctor, as I had no money coming in, and could not pay him for next week, and also that it was for the purpose of getting proper nourishment; before that no one had said that he wanted proper nourishment—I paid the prisoner 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the Monday, which included the four visits and the medicine.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a medical officer of the Barnsbury district, M.R.C.S. and licentiate of the College of Physicians—on Friday, 25th August, about 12.30, I received an order from the relieving officer to go and see the deceased—I found him in a very exhausted, prostrate condition: his breathing was very hard, his pulse quick, weak, and regular; he was partially unconscious, and would evidently die in two or three hours—I examined him, and found he was suffering from considerable consolidation of the right lung—I asked a few questions of the wife, from which I considered the case to be inflammation of the right lung—the inflammation must have existed five or six days, possibly longer—he died four hours afterwards—I ordered him brandy and extract of beef, and so on—I observed no other signs of illness—the only mischief I could find was the inflammation of the lung, pneumonia; I concluded he died from that—the consolidation could not possibly he due to drinking—I know Dr. Kane's dispensary; there was a plate on the door at the time it was established, there is not now; I have never been there myself—the name of "Dr. Kane" was on some small bills pasted on the window a little time ago, but they had ceased to be in August last—from the condition I saw the deceased in on Friday a strong dose of purgative medicine would not be the proper thing to administer to him on Monday—I suspect his lung was in a state of engorgement with blood, and his temperature high; he would probably have severe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188209110037"/>
               <p>headache and more or less pains in his chest and back—you always get those pains when a patient has taken chill, and in any feverish attack—the proper treatment would have been something to reduce the temperature, remove the pains about the chest, and prevent the patient getting into an exhausted condition—a purgative would cause exhaustion, and possibly increase the temperature—whether it would be proper to administer a medicine to bring on sleep would depend on the condition of the patient at the time—I can't say whether, supposing he had had a purgative, a sedative would have been a good thing to follow—his condition might have admitted opium to be given him in moderate doses—I observed the state of the lungs at the post-mortem examination—I assisted Dr. Capon—it was consistent with the opinion I had already formed—he had been suffering from inflammation for five or six days—if a properly qualified man had seen him on the Monday his lung would then have been inflamed, and there would probably, but not certainly, have been physical signs of the inflammation—I can say he had been in that condition more than four days—the average period for engorgement of the lung is three days, and consolidation or redhepitisation takes place in two or three more, and is usually complete on the seventh day, but there are variations—in my judgment, if a properly qualified man had seen him four or five days before the Friday, and examined him as I did, he could have discovered what was the matter with him, and knowing that, he should not have had severe purging treatment; something to open his bowels once or twice might have been permissible, but severe purging would only exhaust and increase the temperature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> If he had known it was pneumonia a mild aperient might be a proper medicine—sometimes a mild aperient acts more strongly than the doctor expects—if the aperient acted too strongly I might give a sedative opium, and watch the effect—I had no reason from what I saw to suppose a strong purgative had been given, only from what I heard at the inquest—I saw the remains of a bottle of medicine—I did not examine it—I did not know he was not attended by a qualified medical man—there was only one bottle, which was taken to be replenished—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) there is nothing particularly strong about this prescription; it is an ordinary black draught—I did not hear the prisoner say before the Coroner that that was what he had given the deceased—if a man had been drinking more beer than was good for him it would predispose his bowels to be violently purged—there is usually pain to a patient suffering from pneumonia—I should expect him to complain of pains in his chest before there were any signs of inflammation in his lungs—the limit with regard to the inflammation may not have been more than five days, from about Sunday noon to Friday noon—as the medical officer of the district, if I was told a patient was suffering from pains in his head, and found his temperature high, I should examine his lungs, especially if he was delirious; if the temperature were normal I should not examine his lungs; if the temperature was something above normal, and the patient said he had had a glass but never got drunk, I should not have been alarmed at the slight increase—98.4 is the normal temperature; if it were 100 I should not think much of it, but if it were 104 I should think there was mischief—I can tell with my hand whether the temperature is raised or not, and if it seems to be above 100 or 102 I use a thermometer—if I found a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188209110038"/>
               <p>patient suffering from headache and a furred tongue, and with a temperature below 100, I should not think it unreasonable to assume his stomach out of order and give an aperient medicine—when I saw the deceased on the Friday he was not able to speak, and I examined him as usual—I went one day to see Dr. Kane's dispensary, and the name was on small bills in the window—I lived close to it with my father, a chemist, a few years ago—the dispensary has been there about a year; I live about a quarter of a mile from it now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> From the wife's evidence as to the number of times the medicine operated I should say the result was too strong for a man in the deceased's condition—I could not tell whether the medicine was too strong or not; it was not the aperient I should have chosen in such a case.</p>

I am assistant to Dr. Kane, and have been so four years. I am not qualified as a medical man. I have charge, alternately with Dr. Kane, of a dispensary in Copenhagen Street, and one in St. James's Road. I was in attendance at Copenhagen Street Dispensary on Monday, 21st, when Mrs. Carroll called and requested me to see her husband. I did not inform her I was not Dr. Kane; the words 'Dr. Kane' are not written up at the dispensary in Copenhagen Street. I went to see the deceased, and found him in a prostrate condition, and I believe he was suffering from alcoholism. He spoke to me quite rationally. He seemed depressed. His stomach was out of order. The tongue was furred, and I treated him accordingly. I noticed that they were in distressed circumstances, and I suggested parish relief for the purpose of procuring nourishment for the deceased. Dr. Kane did not see the deceased at all. I attended him, and saw him last on Thursday, 24th August. He was then weak, but sitting up. I saw nothing dangerous about him; he then spoke rationally. I could not perceive any dangerous symptoms. I have attended a hospital in America. My principal business is making up medicines, and in the absence of Dr. Kane I see patients. Dr. Kane has been unwell, and unable to leave his house. "</p>

I then walked home, and went to the Lord Palmerston late in the evening, but cannot say what time. I was by myself, and remained some time drinking ale, and left about 11 p. m.

I live at 203, Maida Vale, and am a registered medical practitioner—on Monday, 24th July, I was called to the prosecutrix, and found her in bed in a very weak and nervous condition, evidently suffering from shock—I found four wounds on her back and one on her right shoulder, inflicted with a pen-knife or some sharp instrument—if her clothes had not saved her they would have been serious—her ulster prevented their being worse—she must have bled freely, but it had stopped when I saw her—I re-dressed the wounds and she fainted before I had finished; she was in bed about seven days, and I attended her altogether 12 or 14 days.</p>

I call it an empty house, I could not find anything in it"—he could only have got in by the window; the front door was shut; he would have to raise the bottom sash; the shutters were fastened but the bolts were rather out of order, and by a little shaking you can get them open.</p>

Have you lately bought any large quantity of old brass?"—he said, "No, I have not, I have bought a little broken brass, for which I paid 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.a lb.

I have no light, and I am not allowed to have a light by the insurance people; come in the morning, and then you shall search the place"—I said, "I had better do it now"—I sent for a light and got a candle and some matches, and we commenced to search the place—I pulled down a large pile of bundles of rags and rubbish from the back part of the shop; it was 12 feet high from the floor; under all this I found these two compass stands—I said to Thomas, "These are what I am looking for"—he said, "Oh, I re-member, I bought them of a seedy-looking man some time ago "—I said, "What did you pay for them?"—he said, "At the rate of 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a lb.

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 2, Queen Victoria Street—on 22nd June the prisoner called and said, "I am the owner of Haisthorpe Hall, near Beverley, in Yorkshire, and with to sell it by auction, and if you will advance me 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I will place the sale of the estate in your hands; the title deeds are in the hands of my solicitor, Messrs.

Residence, garden, buildings, and land,</p>

               <p>bringing 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year"—I saw my solicitor, Mr. Kite, who arranged with the prisoner to pay 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the legal costs, and they came to me together the next day, and I wrote this cheque on the London and Westminster Bank for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the prisoner's favour, and he endorsed it—it has been returned to me as paid—the prisoner then signed the letter (<hi rend="italic">Dated 22nd June,</hi> 1882, <hi rend="italic">acknowledging the receipt of</hi> 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to be charged with any other turn upon his property at Haisthorpe, which was free and unencumbered, and agreeing to repay the same at one month from date, with the usual power of tale, and agreeing that Mr. Baker should sell the property for him in one month</hi>)—he then signed this bill for 225<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a statutory declaration was also produced, and dated the same day—the month expired, but I have never been a paid—my solicitor has endeavoured to get possession of the property, but it is claimed by the prisoner's father—I parted with my money on the faith of the prisoner's representations entirely.</p>

Leeman, of York, solicitors"—I am sure he said that they were his solicitors—I sent them a telegram the same day, to know if it was correct, and they replied to my solicitors on, I think, the same day we completed it—the money was not advanced till 23rd June, between three and four o'clock, so that I had twelve hours to make inquiries—all the details were conducted by my solicitors—the prisoner said that he was the owner of the estate, not the heir to it—about a week after the bill became due my solicitor recommended me to apply for a warrant, and he was taken about a month afterwards—the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was for my solicitor to go to York and get the deeds from Messrs. Leeman, and then go on to Haisthorpe Hall—I have never lent money to the Hon. Mr. Chetwind, introduced by Frazer; I never heard of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, and act for Mr. Baker—I saw the prisoner on 23rd June, and told him he would have to make a statutory declaration that the property was unencumbered—I was in Mr. Baker's office on 23rd June, when the prisoner signed this letter—I drew this statutory declaration (<hi rend="italic">Signed George <hi rend="largeCaps">H</hi>. Boynton, of Haisthorpe Hall, Beverley, stating that the title-deeds were free from any encumbrance</hi>)—be then signed this letter to Mr. Leeman: "23rd June. Dear Sir,—Please deliver to Mr. Henry F. Kite, solicitor, London, the title-deeds of Haisthorpe Hall, together with all letters and papers connected therewith now in your possession"—we agreed for 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my expenses of going into Yorkshire and doing the business—I communicated with Messrs. Leeman, and they wrote that they had no deeds—I have never been able to obtain them, and I found that the prisoner's father is in possession of the estate.</p>

               <p>that Mr. Baker had telegraphed—our offices are in the same building—the prisoner was in my office, I think, twice—this letter says "the deeds are in possession of "—there was then a blank, in which is inserted "Messrs. Leeman, of York"—that is in my writing—there is no statement that Messrs. Leeman are the prisoner's solicitors; he told me they were—I heard Mr. Baker read it over to him—I might have read the letter to the prisoner, but not the statutory declaration—I did not go to York or to Haisthorpe Hall—when the warrant was applied for I had seen the prisoner's lather's solicitors, and ascertained that he was the eldest son—I heard from Messrs. Leeman two or three days after the money was lent—they never told me that they had ever acted for the owner of Haisthorpe Hall—my first interview with the prisoner's father's solicitor was a week or 10 days after the money was lent, and then I was not sure that Captain Boynton was in possession, as the property was called Haisthorpe Lodge and Haisthorpe Farm—I did not discover that it was Haisthorpe Hall till shortly before the proceedings; it took me nearly a month to satisfy myself—the 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was added to the bill, at my suggestion, for expenses; none of it was for interest—I did not wait till the bill was due to see whether it was paid or not before applying for a warrant—it was no question of the bill, not of its existence even—the prisoner did not ask me to take it up or to give him time after it became due; but a week after the advance he asked for a further loan of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he came to my office with his wife, and I asked him to explain the statement I had taken down—he said that Messrs. Leeman must have made a mistake; he offered a further security, which was an order of the Divorce Court, purporting to show that he was entitled to the reversion—it was a copy, and I have either got a copy of it in my office or the one he brought—it showed that he was entitled in reversion to the income of a fund payable to his mother during her life, and after her death to himself—I immediately instituted inquiries, and found he had parted with that reversion about 1872—I had not evidence enough to give him in custody, but I did not advance him any more money—I asked him for an explanation—he said he was going to Haisthorpe in a few days, and in the meantime would I look at the papers he brought—I don't think I saw him again till he was in custody—I saw Johnson, Upton, and Co., Captain Boynton's solicitors, six or seven times before the bill became due, and my agents in the country communicated with the country solicitor, as I wanted to discover who was in possession—after the prisoner had got the cheque I sent a boy after him, asking him to return, but he went to the bank first and got the cheque—he then came back, and we had a long conversation as to the best mode of selling the property—this document (<hi rend="italic">the authority to hand over the deeds</hi>) was not signed till after the money was obtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> After the cheque was obtained I thought it necessary to get the title-deeds from Leeman—after he returned from the hank the subject of our conversation was whether the auction should take place in the country or in town—after receiving Messrs.

I live at Brewery House, Chertsey—on 8th June the prisoners came and lodged at my house—Klenck gave his name as Benson, a furniture dealer, of 152, Waterloo Road—Marsh gave no name—Klenck said he had taken a house of Mr. Arrowsmith, a neighbour of mine, and was going to open a furniture shop, and wanted my lodgings for a month—they slept there that night, occupying the same room-they did not return the next night, but returned on Saturday, the 10th, and said they were going to Portsmouth—on Thursday, 15th, they came and remained all night, and next day they told me they had not succeeded in taking the shop of Mr. Arrowsmith, and hired a storeroom of me at 18 shillings a month—I fetched two loads of furniture for Klenck from the railway station that day, boxes and other things—they both received it, and gave me the money to pay the carriage to the station-the goods were put into my storeroom, and an hour after they were put into Preston's van—the prisoners told me they were coming back to dinner—I saw them going along the road with the furniture—they did not return—they never paid me—Marsh never mentioned his name.</p>

I am prisoner's wife—he is a plasterer—we live at 9, Rutland Street, Brompton—we have been married thirteen years, and have two children—on 17th August, about 4 p.m., he came home intoxicated and excited—he said, "Will you give me some money for some beer?"—I said,"I have none, I want to go down and do my work"—he said, "You won't go out of the room"—we only occupy one room—he pushed me on the bed at once, locked the door, got a table-knife, and stabbed me as fast as he could—I received two large stabs in my left arm and on the fore finger of my left hand, and a large cut across the back of the right hand—I put up my hands to protect myself, when my little finger was nearly cut off, and received a cut on the fore finger of the right hand and one on the thumb—when he locked the door he said, "You do not go out of here, I'll settle you"—I screamed—my little boy, ten years old, got between us, and pulled him off me—the prisoner is rather strange, especially when he has had some drink; when he is drunk he does not know what he is after—he ill-treated me two years ago, when he said he would kill me with his large hammer, and he beat me—he cut his own throat with a pen-knife—I have suffered considerable pain—I went to Dr. Rentzsch—the prisoner had his coat off—I could not say when ho took it off.</p>

Gabriel, and knowing the firm I believed it to be a good cheque; next day I passed the cheque through my bankers and I made inquiry at Messrs. Gabriel's—the same afternoon the cheque was returned marked "N.S."—on the evening of the 10th the prisoner was in the coffee room busying himself with some papers which he brought; he said "I wish you would give me the balance of that cheque"—I said "It is unusual for us to change cheques except for tradespeople; are you really the manager to Messrs. Gabriel, and is this cheque a good one?"—I had previously heard it was not—he said he was the manager and the cheque was a good one, and he made an appointment to see to my teeth at the same time—I said "If you come in to-morrow at 12 I will give you the balance of the cheque," and no sooner said than done, be went off like a shot, and I never saw him afterwards.</p>

I am house surgeon at the London Hospital; Ann Bishop was brought there on the morning of July 25th, suffering from a clean cut incised wound on the left side of the neck, at the lower part, about two inches in length; it was superficial in most of its extent, but went to a depth of half an inch in its deepest part; she left the hospital on 1st August; it is nothing serious, and she is not being attended to now—this knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) might have caused the wound; it might have been self-inflicted—I cannot say it is more likely to have been inflicted by anybody else than by herself; it is just possible, but hardly probable, that the wound was self-inflicted; it is so low down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary to the South London Tram ways Company—in consequence of an intimation from the Magistrate our Company took up this prosecution—Micklewright entered the service of the Company the latter part of May—in June we sent out about 42,000 circulars, and he was engaged in directing wrappers—our Company had an account with the Alliance Bank in Bartholomew Lane—it was closed on 29th April—we had received this cheque-book, which was in use till the closing of the account—our practice is to stamp the cheques—it was kept in the safe till some time after closing the account, when it. was put in a cupboard to which Micklewright had access—he wrote letters from my dictation, and sometimes I handed him letters and told him what to write, and they were brought to me to sign—I found that he had more than once signed my name told his I objected to any one signing for me; I found be had not obeyed that order once afterwards—at page 410 of this letter-book one letter is not my signature, but Micklewright's—the other letter is signed by me—Micklewright addressed about 2,000 circulars of about 6, 000, which were addressed in the office as overtime or taken away to be addressed—he was paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an hour for over-work, and earned about 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in addition to his wages—he was discharged on the 11th July—I find four cheques missing from this cheque-book, Nos. 44893—6; 44893 is the cheque for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 44894 the cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. passed to Hammond—the names on the cheques are not names of our directors—they are fictitious as far as I know—the "H. C. Richardson" is not my signature; I believe it to be Micklewright's; comparing it with the signature, in the letter-book I believe they are the same writing—the "C. Wilkinson" on the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque is Micklewright's writing—Micklewright had no authority to sign cheques—he said he could write five or six different hands—I had not seen Pearce till I saw him at the police-court—as far as I know he had nothing to do with addressing the circulars, nor had any Mr. Watson—there is a great similarity between the endorsement on the cheques and the filling up, especially the "three pounds 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the signature of "J. Thompson," who is signed in place of one of the directors on the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. cheque—the cheques are signed by names as directors, and countersigned by my name as the secretary in the usual form, and the form adopted when Micklewright was in the service of the Company.</p>

There is a minute sanctioning this prosecution—the Company have not been defrauded—Micklewright was first employed temporarily; we got him from the Envelope Addressing Company at Greskam House—some of the money to pay for addressing the circulars passed through Micklewright's hands—he gave out the work—I do not know how long this cheque-book was kept in the cupboard.</p>

Micklewright did not come into our employ till after the account with the Alliance was closed, I think soon after—I find a letter in his writing of 17th May—the cupboard was not locked, and the cheque-book was open to three or four clerks—Mr. Robinson's coat was missed once, I believe, while Micklewright was there—the directors did not want to prosecute, thinking it was a case for the Public Prosecutor—I sign "H. Cameron Richardson," and used a flourish; the cheque is signed "H. C. Richardson," and Micklewright's signatures have no flourish—Mr. Robinson's writing has some resemblance to mine—we make no difference in signing the cheques in our London Bank whether the amount be large or</p>

Baker first came to the house the Archer's and I live in about six weeks ago; he came to lodge there three weeks before he was apprehended. On the day Sergeant Francis apprehended me on this charge the prisoner Baker asked me to take two pieces of flannel, I think they were white, and a piece of calico to sell. I took them to 23, Octavia Street, to Mr. Ives; they were all in one bundle, tied up together. Baker said he worked for a man that travelled with goods, but did not say where he got them from. Mrs. Archer was in my room by the door when Baker gave me the things. I was to bring the money back to Baker, but I did not get anything for them. Soon after Baker came to our house, a day or two, I saw these knives and forks on a deal table in the back room, which is Mrs. Rogers's living-room. I never saw Baker with the knives when I went down that morning. The morning I first saw the knives Baker was then in the room; he asked me if I knew any one that wanted to buy any knives. I took them to Mrs. Ives, at 23, Octavia Street. I did not sell them then, but in the evening of the same day I pledged them at Mr. Norfolk's in the Lower Road, Deptford.

On 16th July I was house-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital, and was called to see the prosecutor—he was very noisy and excited, and under the influence of drink—he was bleeding from his side—I found a large wound there and ordered his admission to the hospital, where I examined him, and found him suffering from six wounds, one near the left knee, one on the left thigh, one in the back, and one in the left side two inches under the ribs—it went downwards and backwards towards the spine—it was five inches deep and passed dose behind the large bowel—it was dangerous, and would require force to inflict it, considering the size of the knife—the others were skin Meads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The chances are that the knife would not have blood on the handle, as the clothes would prevent the blood from coming out—there would not be much hæmorrhage and signs of blood in the road, as the opening was small though the depth was great—it would take ten minutes to extend to the clothes and make marks.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 5, Surrey Place, Albany Road, Camberwell—I saw the prosecutor on this night, about 12. 15, walking down the Albany Road, and I saw him lying on the pavement calling out "Police "—I ran up with Mr. Bates, and asked him what was the matter—I saw the prisoner run into Kennington Lane—I searched about 100 yards from the prosecutor in the direction the man ran—I found and showed him the watch, and he identified it—I gave the watch to the policeman.</p>

I was on duty in the Albany Road—I saw two men struggling—I saw one fall to the ground, the other, the prisoner, walk towards me—the one that fell called "Murder," and "Police," and the prisoner commenced to run—I ran to meet him—he turned the corner—I saw his hand go and heard something fall—I asked him what he knocked that old man down for—he said he had not touched any one, he had got something better to do—I took him back to the prosecutor—the prosecutor said, "That man has stole my watch "—I told him to follow me to the police-station, and took the prisoner to the police-station—while I was taking the charge Derby brought the watch—I kept sight of the prisoner the whole time—about 4 a. m. I found the glass about ten yards from where I took him into custody.</p>

When I got near where the people were the constable ran out and said, 'Halloa, what have you done?' I said, 'I have done nothing. 'He took me back to the prosecutor, who said, 'My watch, my watch, have you got my watch?' I said, 'No; I have something better to do than to steal your watch. '"</p>
