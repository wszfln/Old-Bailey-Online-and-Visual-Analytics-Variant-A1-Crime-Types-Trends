I live with my mother at 19, Pelham Place, South Kensington—on Saturday night, May 27th, I went to bed about ten, after seeing the house perfectly safe—I was awoke about half-past eleven by the breaking of glass—I waited a little, and then heard a second breaking of glass—I got out of bed and went to my window—I heard a window below open, and I opened my window—I heard noises below in the scullery—I then opened my door, and went on the landing and listened, and distinctly heard the latch of the passage door move a little—I then went to my mother's room—she rang her bell and I opened her window, and cried, "Police!"—a gentleman was passing, and he went and fetched the police—when I went to bed the scullery window was perfectly safe—I saw it afterwards, and it was then wide open, and a pane of glass was broken, and the bolt was broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chartered accountant, and was appointed trustee in the prisoner's bankruptcy on June 4th, 1892—I am also trustee in McPhearson's bankruptcy—it was the prisoner's practice to accept bills drawn by McPhearson and Co.—at the date of the bank<lb/>ruptcy McPhearson had drawn bills for £2,700—the prisoner owed McPhearson at the time of McPhearson's failure £3,800, for which McPhearson had drawn £2,700 and discounted on the Bank of Scotland—so long as McPhearson went on propping the prisoner up he could go n, but when McPhearson came down the prisoner came down too—the</p>

               <p>prisoner was a coal merchant—I found in the cash-book a sum of £608 not accounted for—proceedings were taken before Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams to set aside the payment to Dowland of £300 as fraudulent and void against me, and as to Morgan's £100 that was a fraudulent prefer<lb/>ence—I received this letter from the young lady in answer to a letter of mine addressed to Morgan at Benally Road—I have a copy of the letter I wrote in my letter-book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> McPhearson failed for £64,000—he did not bring down five or six others; they brought him down—five or six other persons failed in the same way as the prisoner, that is, they owed McPhearson money, and he went on giving them credit till he failed—McPhearsons are wholesale coal merchants—I first took counsel's opinion about this matter with reference to criminal proceedings in this case immediately before application was made; I cannot tell the date—the application was to prosecute the prisoner and Dowland—I knew about the £300 and the £100 some time about October or November—the moment I knew of it I brought the thing before the Chief Judge—it took time to get these facts out—the Chief Judge heard it in February, and immediately after that I took evidence—the application to Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams was put down in December, but was not reached till February—after the Chief Judge's decision I took counsel's opinion—the prisoner was a long time under examination in bankruptcy, and was asked a great many questions—my suspicions were aroused in this case from the very first—from the moment I found a cash-book not made up, I suspected the bankrupt—I have acted as trustee in a hundred bankruptcies—when I find a cash-book that has hitherto been made up, and then it it not made up, and when I find a balance of £600 stopping short, I begin to suspect it—this man kept a cash account—it was capitally kept—his turnover would be about £20 or £30, or perhaps £40 a week—all his books were capitally kept—I do not know that he only got commission on coal he sold—it is not the fact, because I have looked into the books—the prisoner did not accept accommodation bills for McPhearson—he never accepted for McPhearson for anything more than he owed them at any time, so far as I can make out—I should think I have seen the prisoner a dozen times—I have seen him about three times at my office—I should think the longest interview I had with him at my office lasted from two to ten minutes—I don't think I ever examined him at my office as to any entries in the books—I applied for his examination before the Registrar—on one or two occasions the prisoner was sent for to the office to give an explanation as to the book debts—he gave it, I believe—he had a lot of book debts standing in his ledger which I found out afterwards were paid, and I had to get an explanation of it.</p>

               <p>duty in uniform at a fixed point in Marylebone Road—about a quarter-past nine, in consequence of information, I went to 23, Oxford Terrace, and saw Mr. Bethell opposite—he was upset, his tie and collar were dis<lb/>arranged; he was crying, and complained of having been assaulted, and pointed to No. 23—whilst I was talking to him I saw a woman, who I afterwards found to be the prisoner's wife, come from the front door—she made a statement to me and went in again, shutting the door—in a short time I saw her again come up the area steps; she seemed greatly upset and in a fainting condition—she went next door to No. 22—there was a very disorderly crowd in front of the house, I should say of about fifty people, shouting and creating a disturbance—at that time I was the only constable there—a lady came on the balcony and said, "Do something, I have got somebody ill up here"—I suppose that was addressed to me—about this time I heard the front parlour window going up, and saw the prisoner standing behind the window with a revolver in his hand, pointed at me—I was standing among the crowd—I at once drew back and sent for police assistance—after a short time I saw constable Conyers at the corner of Marylebone Road—I whistled to him and ran towards him, and we came back to No. 23; we were joined by two other constables—when about fifteen or twenty yards from the house I beard the report of firearms, and saw constable Fraser coming from the house, bleeding from the head—he called out, "I am shot"—Conyers got a cab—I asked the mob to go away quietly; they did not—I and the two other constables went into the house, and into the front parlour, and there saw the prisoner and constable Maddison struggling on the floor—I went to Maddison's assistance, and the prisoner was taken into custody, and taken to the station—he was very violent on the way; he kept muttering something in a foreign language—he was bleeding from the head; I don't know how that had occurred—I asked Maddison—he said he could not account for it unless it was done in the struggle—he was attended to at the station by the police surgeon—the blood was running down his face; it was not much—I was present when he was charged; he made no answer to it.</p>

On the evening of 27th May, about twenty minutes past nine, I was on duty in the Junction Road—a little boy came to me, and in consequence of what he said I went to Oxford Terrace—I saw Bethell, who made a complaint to me, upon which I went up to the doorstep of No. 23; a hospital nurse was there, and the door was shut—I did not see any other constable at that time—I saw a woman looking out of the third floor window—she said, "It is all right now, nurse; go down in the area, and you can get in"—my attention was then taken to the dining-room window; it was open, and the prisoner was stand<lb/>ing at it with a revolver in each hand—he was leaning out of the window, looking over the flower box at the nurse—she left the door and went down the area—I did not speak to the prisoner at that time—the woman at the window came rushing along the passage and rushed out on the doorstep, and called the nurse back, as she. was going down the area steps, and the nurse came back and entered the house with the woman who had rushed out—I then saw the prisoner standing at the end of the passage, by the dining-room door, with a revolver in his hand; he was about four or five yards from me, but it was dark in the passage, and I could not tell exactly—I called to him that I wanted to speak to him—I was terrified at seeing the revolver—I closed the door, but had my foot between the door and the framework—the prisoner came and pushed against the door, and I fell against it—at that time constable Fraser came up—I can't say whether he pushed or not; that was the first I saw of Fraser—the prisoner was pushing at the door from inside—I pushed the door to relieve my foot—I pushed it open, and as I did so the prisoner seemed to stand back, and I and Fraser fell almost head foremost into the passage—the prisoner was then standing a little way in the passage against the wall on the left-hand side—on regaining my feet I saw the prisoner raise the revolver in his right hand between me and Fraser, and he fired—I was but a few inches from him, facing him—I also saw a revolver in his left hand, which was round Fraser's neck, and it was pointed at me, and Fraser fell back and said, "Mate, I am shot"—I had seized the barrel of the revolver before Fraser fell back—I closed with the prisoner and we struggled and fell in the passage twice—he said, "Now I have had my revenge"—I said "Yes, you have shot my mate in the head"—Fraser was not taking any part in the struggle, no one but me and the prisoner—we had a severe struggle, and got into the dining-room, and a lot of furniture was knocked down, flower-pots and so on—I took from him the revolver he had fired, and produce it—he had hold of it until we fell under the table—the other revolver was taken by Fraser—I understood the prisoner to say that his paintings were damaged, and that he had been greatly annoyed—he asked me to let him get up, and promised that he would not hurt me, and he then released his hold of the revolver—at that time some other constables came in and I was taken from the top of him and taken to the station in a cab—I was exhausted with the struggle—I took the revolver with me to the station—it was a five-chambered revolver; it was loaded in four chambers, the fifth contained an empty cartridge-case.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-nurse at Hackney Union Infirmary—this child came there on 5th May; it was attended to by Dr. Gordon; it was in a very dirty state—it had on a knickerbocker suit, a little shirt, no boots; a little piece of material was sewn on its feet and legs in the form of socks—I should say from its appearance that the shirt had been worn five or six weeks, if not longer; it was very dirty—its head was filthily dirty, the hair very long, and covered with vermin—the eyes were closed; I had to bathe them before he could open them, on account of the dirt—it was covered with vermin, also with vermin bites, all over the body; the toes were very emaciated, and there was so much dirt on them I thought they were all joined together; when I washed them they separated; there was dirt and vermin in between the toes and in the toe-nails; they had not been cut—the child was washed during the next two or three days, and in about three days it had no vermin about it—ordinary soap and water would have prevented it from being in such a dirty state—it died on the 17th June.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical superintendent of Hackney Infirmary—this child entered the infirmary on the 5th May, and was under my care until 17th June, when it died—when I first saw it the body and limbs were in an extremely emaciated condition, I never saw such a specimen of humanity—it had been washed slightly, but the body was still in a very dirty condition—I did not notice the toes—the nurse had washed it before I saw it—the hair was full of vermin, and the body was covered from head to foot with vermin bites—when it first came in I did not think it would live twenty-four hours, and I was not able to make a minute examination, it was in such a weak condition—after the first few hours it took its food ravenously, and would cry for more—on the 7th of May it weighed seven pounds seven ounces, about the weight of a newborn child—the average weight of a child of that age is about thirty-nine pounds—on 22nd May it weighed eighteen pounds four ounces—it seemed to get a fresh cold, and it died in the early morning of 17th June—on the following day Dr. Aveling and myself made a post-mortem examination—I found tubercular deposits in the abdominal glands, and commencing tubercular deposits in the liver, spleen, and lungs—there was not a particle of fat about the body—if it was disposed at all to consumption, sitting out in the backyard as described would be quite enough to strengthen the disease—from the post-mortem appearances, the disease could not have been in progress more than three months—being kept in the dirt it was would undoubtedly cause suffering and injury to its health</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189306260035"/>
               <p>—a small frock and a pair of boots would not be sufficient clothing for it in any weather—bread was not sufficient food for it—it had a cough, I could not say for how long, it might have been a good while; that would cause it to get thin, but not to that extent—the tubercular deposit showed that it must die—it was the most puny thing I ever saw, but the disease had not progressed enough to account for its condition.</p>

Hedges, 49, White Lion Street—I wrote to those persons and got these answers—Aston took the house on this agreement; I saw him sign it—I applied for rent on 25th December, when it became due—he never paid a farthing—I went to the premises the Friday after 25th December—I saw no one then; the door was locked and I could not get in—I went to the addresses of the two references, but could not find either of them—some time after I got possession of the house; we had great difficulty in getting the keys or possession—when I went to demand my rent and when I found the place shut up, I saw no appearance of any trade.</p>

               <p>Mill, Oldham—in December last I got an order through my traveller for a ton of flock for Newman and Aston, of 1, Rockliffe Street, Islington, and I sent flock to the value of about £4 19s.9d.—in the beginning of January I received another order direct from Newman and Aston for a ton of flock—I executed it; its value was £5 0s.5d.—I sent in an account in the ordinary way—I have not been paid any part of that account—when I parted with my goods I believed there was a genuine business being carried on at 1, Rockliffe Street—on 2nd January I received an order for a sample ton, purporting to come from M. A. Lewis, of Hoxton Street—I wrote saying that as it was a first transaction we should want cash and references—I had this answer. (<hi rend="italic">Giving as references Aston, of De Beauvoir Street, and Seymour, of</hi> 12, <hi rend="italic">Boundary Street</hi>)—I wrote to the references—I don't think I got any reply from Aston—I had this letter from Seymour—I did not execute the orders from Lewis—I subsequently got these orders from Williams, Stamford Hill, and White, of 29, De Beauvoir Street—I did not execute them—I thought there was a similarity about the writing of the letters signed Seymour, White, Williams, and Lewis, and in consequence declined to execute the orders—no part of my account has been paid.</p>

P.), purporting to come from Wilkins asking for samples of boot protectors and iron lasts—I forwarded that order, which came to £2 6s.6d.—at the end of the month I applied for payment, and I received no payment, but a further order for about £5 worth of goods, with a promise to send a cheque for the whole amount—I did not execute that order—I sent several applications for payment—I received a letter (which I have since destroyed) in a black-edged envelope supposed to be written by Mrs. Wilkins, saying that Mr. Wilkins had departed this life and left her in straitened circumstances—I went to Millfield Road and inquired about the neighbourhood as to whether there had been any funeral there, and as to the sort of people they were—I went to the place, and saw Holmes and a woman—I asked Holmes if Wilkins was there—he said, "No, he has just gone"—I said I would call in the afternoon—I called the same night and saw Holmes, and asked him two or three questions—he said, "He has not been back again"—I said, "Can you tell me where his other shops are, if he has got any?"—he said, "I dare not do that; there are a lot of them"—I said, "Where is my stuff gone to?"—he said, "To some of the other shops"—I said, "Where are the other shops?"—he said, "There are a lot of them; one of them is in the Portobello Road, Notting Hill, but for God's sake don't tell him I have told you, I have had nothing for breakfast"—I relieved him and went to Portobello Road, but I could not find a shop in the name of Wilkins—next morning I met Holmes, who said, "They are not here, and I don't know where they are; but I have got nothing to do, and I have got no money; can you do with a pawnticket? I have a pawnticket for boots"—I said, "No; I don't want to have anything to do with that; what are they?"—he said, "They are samples of boots that have been sent to us"—I went to the landlord, and we succeeded in getting the prisoners out, and the landlord gave me permission to take from the window my goods, four dozen and five cards of boot protectors, valued wholesale at 1s. 11/2d.; they would be sold retail for about 4s.5d.</p>

Masters called on me, and said his name was Wilson, of 5, Bouverie Street, Stoke Newington. He gave as references Mr. Watson, of 71, Malvern Road, Dalston, and A. Burton, of 20, Woodfield, Mildmay Park. I handed the application and references to Mr. Ash, and there my business then ended. In June, 1892, in consequence of what Mr. Ash told me, I went to 60, Bickerton Road. I did not find Masters there. I found two lodgers there, both women; their rent-books showed that their rents were paid. I took steps to recover possession of the house. At that time No. 58, Bickerton Road was in our hands to let, and a man giving the name of Walters, of 99, Fairbridge Road, applied to me. I do not see him here. "</p>

I am an inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department—in April last I received a warrant for the apprehension of the defendants and two others—on April 5th I went to 9, Canonbury Road and saw Morton; I said, "Lowther, I want to speak to you"—I knew him as Lowther—I said, "Come outside"—we got into a cab, and I conveyed him to the station, and read the warrant to him and Bowen, who was. there—neither of them made any reply—I said, "There are other addresses"—he said, "I only lodged in Prospect Place"—I said to Aston, "I hold a warrant for you under the name of Fortescue"—we went to the house and I read the warrant to him—he said, "I do not know anything about the piano"—on April 6th I saw Aston at Clerken well Station with a man named Lowther—I read the warrant—Aston said, "Yes, it is quite right"—Lowther has since been discharged—I went to 97, Canonbury Road, and found Marks—I took him in custody, and went back and searched the house, and found four receipts for rent of 16, Park Street, in the name of Tomlinson—in the bedroom occupied by Burton I found an invoice of Watson and this workman's time-book; the last entry is November, 1888—I also found a. book containing the names of Graham, Wheeler, Burton, Simmonds, Brown, Morton, Thompson, King, and Wallsey; and a book of Watson and Co., 92, Canonbury Road, and a letter of Hedges and Co.—I searched the house of a man named Wilson—on 21st April I saw Holmes at King's Cross Police-station, and asked him his name—he said, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> Holmes"—I said, "I hold a warrant for William Holmes," giving him the address—he said, "I never lived there; I am not the man"—he after wards sent for me and made a statement—I saw him write his name and address at the station.</p>

On April 21st, at 3. 30, I saw Holmes in Holloway Road—I said, "I am going to take you to the station, where you will be charged, with six other men, with taking houses"—he said, "I don't understand you, governor"—he took out an agreement for 42, St. James's Road, and tore it in two pieces"—he said, "I don't know anything of the other men"—next morning, at one a. m., I took Burton at.

On April 15th I followed Bowen to Mildmay Grove, and said, "I am a police-officer; I shall arrest you on a charge of forgery"—he said, "Oh, what is it all about?"—I said, "The inspector will tell you"—on 16th April I saw Aston in the top room at 33, De Beauvoir Square, and said, "I shall take you on a warrant for taking houses"—he went downstairs, over a wall, to the back of 5, Derby Road, and through that house to Inglefield Road and Bloomsbury Street, where he was stopped—I took him back to the house for his coat—he said, "I don't mind being caught, but it took a long time; I did take No. 1, Brockley Street; I have lived two and a half years at De Beauvoir Square"—when the charge was read he said, "There is only one item in that charge I know anything about; the pianos and bassinettes I know nothing about"—I searched his house and found this letter, mentioning work to be done by Hedges, the builder—I was keeping observation on 16, Park Street, and saw Holmes, Burton, Austin, Bowen, and Martin, and about nine o'clock one night I saw Burton removing. goods with a little van.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an expert in handwriting, of 59, Holborn Viaduct—taking this agreement, signed "John King," as a basis, I have examined a number of documents signed King, Smith, Fortescue, Poole, John Showers, and James Williams; they are all in the same writing as the agreement—I believe these four receipts for the rent of 16, Park Street, in the name of Tomlinson, are in Aston's writing, and also the letter signed "W. Herbert," which is a reference for Mr. Wilkinson, who was taking No. 7, Lenthall Road—I believe the docu ments purporting to be written by W. Charles as a reference for Mr. Poole to be Austin's writing, the same as the agreement—I have compared the Jetter produced by the constable this morning, and proved to be written by Burton, with the letter signed "J. Weald, of Caledonian Street," and with the document from 29, Ledfield Road, signed "A. Barton," they are in Barton's writing as to references—this document F. F. 1, signed. "T. Barton," giving another reference, is in Barton's writing—there are other documents in Barton's writing—this is a letter written by Watson, and giving the name of Montague—these other letters are in Rafferty's writing—I am familiar with other specimens—this</p>

               <p>letter signed "J. Masters" is in Rafferty's writing, and so are these marked J. G.1 and J. G. 2, and C. H. P. 2 and C. H. P. 4, signed "John Wilson <hi rend="italic">pro pro</hi> Aston and Wilson," also this reference to Allen, also H. M. 2, and three letters signed "Martin" and one signed "Browning"—I have looked at the writing in the pocket-book, and compared it with the letter E. A. P. in respect of G. Wilson, and signed W. Holmes; that is in Holmes' writing, and so is the signature to the agreement, and so is this letter from Charlton Place, returning the key—the agreement between Captain Penton and Masters is in Masters' writing, and so are these accounts, H. E. A. C. 1 and K. P. 1, which is a bill for making three joints for some water pipes, signed "Wm. Johnson"—this agreement, H. J. L. 3, is in Bowen's writing, and so is H. E. A. 146, and so is part of S. R. 25, the whole of the manuscript part, and so is this letter stating that W. Thomas has viewed 105, Bouverie Road, and giving Wilkins and Simmons as references—this agreement for 60, Bickerton Road is in Bowen's writing, also this (<hi rend="italic">an order for tiles</hi>), and this letter.</p>

I first became acquainted with him when he was in Brewers Lane, Strand. I had been on the street then as a prostitute three or four weeks. He frequently came to see me when I resided at 168, Quin Square, Waterloo, and at 24, Stangate Street, Lambeth, where I passed as Mrs. Cooke, and in October last he has stayed at the latter address with me; I kept him. He was on annual leave, and passed off in the house as a waiter. He has often struck me, and one night he caught hold of me in South ampton Street and shook me by the throat. That would be about last Christmas. Since then he came to my lodging, 13, College Street, and beat me, but for what I don't know. I left that lodging shortly after because I was ashamed to stay there through him. Last Thursday, the 20th, he came to my lodging and took away all my letters from my box, and my key. I met him in the Strand yesterday afternoon and asked him for it; he refused to give it me. I then came to Bow Street and com plained of his conduct, but I refused to give his name or number. He knows I am a prostitute walking the Strand for my living. "<hi rend="italic">By George Cooke:</hi>"What name were you living in at 168, Quin Square?" "Croucher." "Did I ever go and take the room with you?" "Yes; at 13, College Street; we took that room, and paid one week's rent, six shillings, and you stayed with me the first night." "What was the reason I came to your room and hit you after six that morning?" "A policeman told you I was larking about in the Strand the evening before." "Why did I stay my long leave with you?" Because you said you had no money to go anywhere else."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's report at Bow Street same date:</hi>"With reference to the complaint made against me by Maud Smith, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Cooke, I beg to report I first knew her in June, 1891, and I went to see her at 168, Quin Square, Waterloo Road, and 13, College Street, and 24, Stangate Street. I always paid her what she asked me. As regards her taking a room at any time in my name, and saying we were man and wife, I was ignorant of it at the time. Last September she refused to let me keep company with a woman I was shortly getting married to, and I had to leave her, as she said Maud Smith was always waiting to see where I went, and it preyed on my mind; I could not stand it any longer. I admit going one morning to 13, College Street, and striking her, but as regards the long leave in September I had made arrangements to go home to my friends, but on going in the morning from Bow Street she was waiting for me, and persuaded me to go to her at 24, Stangate Street As regards a latchkey, I never had one.")</p>

On Tuesday, 6th June, I was on duty op posite the North Pole public-house, about ten minutes past ten—I knew the prisoner as a constable attached to the Notting Dale Police-station; I did not know him as Cooke—there are two constables who go on duty at night round the prison on Wormwood Scrubbs; they would pass me as they went on duty—a constable passed me going in that direction—soon after he had passed me a young woman spoke to me, and made some inquiry—in answer to her inquiry I pointed out the constable who had just before passed me, and she walked after him quickly, along North Pole Road, in the direction of the prison—from the pace she was going I should imagine she would have caught him up in Wood Lane; from there he would pass up Du Cane Road—I remember seeing Constable Kemp pass me later on, I should think about half-past eleven, going in the same direction—on the 8th June I saw the dead body of a woman at the mortuary, and I recognised her as the same woman who had spoken to me on that night.</p>

I am a chemist employed at Wormwood Scrubbs Prison—I live in a cottage beside the prison, facing towards Du Cane Road, it is part of the prison itself—beside my cottage a pathway runs on to the Scrubbs—at the top of that pathway there is a wooden stile and three upright posts, and at the other corner there is a plank adjoining leading over the Scrubbs—on 6th June, about a quarter to eleven, I was coming home from Wood Lane up Du Cane Road—when I was within a few yards of my cottage I noticed two people standing in front of the cottage—there is a lamp a few yards further up on the opposite side—I could not see who the two people were until I got close to them; then</p>

               <p>I noticed it was a young female and a police constable in uniform, on duty—I passed them to go into my cottage—as I passed I said, "Good night" to the constable, and he turned round and said, "Good-night" as I passed him—when I was a few yards away from them I heard them talking loudly, in an angry tone—they appeared to be speaking to one another in an angry tone—I did not catch what was said—I went indoors, and first to my bedroom and then, in about a minute, went into the kitchen; that is a room outside which the two were standing at the time I entered—I still heard the voices, and I distinctly heard the man say, "I don't know where he," or she," lives"—I did not catch whether it was "he" or "she"—both the voices went on for some few minutes, still in the same tone, as if they were having an altercation; then they suddenly ceased—I went to the side door of the house, opened it, and went into the back garden and listened for about a minute—the garden abuts on the pathway of which I have spoken—I did not hear anything; all was quiet, and I returned to the house within a minute or so—I had some supper, and then took up a book and commenced reading—I read for about half an hour or more, I should say; the supper would have taken me about ten minutes—then I heard footsteps on the gravel path in Du Cane Road in front of the cottage, and then I heard a voice say, "Are you going off now?"—I do not think it was the same man's voice I had previously heard—as near as I can give it I think it was then about half-past eleven, or it might be later—I did not take particular notice of the time, I am not speaking by watch or clock—that was the last voice I heard that night outside the house—I read a little after that, and then went to bed—on the 10th June I went to the Hammersmith Mortuary, and there saw the dead body of a woman, and I identified it as that of the female I had seen talking to the constable—I afterwards gave to the police at Notting Dale Station a description of the constable I had seen that night—the constables on duty round the prison sometimes put their capes behind my front garden gate, and come for, them when they require them—I cant say that I had seen the constable I saw talking with the woman before—he was the only constable I saw; I noticed that particularly, because I have nearly always spoken to two of them at that time of night, but I noticed there was only that one that night.</p>

I am a divisional surgeon of police, of Portland Road, Notting Hill—I was called to Wormwood Scrubbs about seven a. m., and found the dead body of a woman lying on the ground on her back—there was blood on her forehead and head, and clotted blood under her head—there were two fractures of the skull, one over the right eye and the other over the right ear, and the right eyeball was smashed—those two fractures could not have been the result of one blow—the fracture of the skull over the right eye and smashing the right eyeball might have been done by one blow—the lower jaw was fractured in two places, which could not have been the result of one blow—there was blood on the palm of the right hand, which was under the body; the left hand was on the body, clenched—those in juries must have been the result of direct violence, and inflicted by some lard substance—the body was removed to the mortuary at Hammersmith—round the body the grass was wet, but under the body it was dry—I made a post-mortem examination next day at the mortuary and saw several bruises just by the jaw on the right side, and one on the right shoulder, about the size of the palm of a hand—I found laceration as well as exten sive hemorrhage of the brain, which was probably caused by the injuries I saw—the cause of death was fractured skull and hemorrhage—I think the injuries on the head might have been done with this truncheon, numbered</p>

               <p>day that the prisoner gave me this history about tier, and I told him she had better not come to my place again—on the 6th June, about 6 p. m., I came off duty, and the prisoner was in the house; I think he was in bed—I did not see him go out; I saw him come in, in plain clothes, soon, after nine; that was Tuesday night—it was usual for him to be in plain clothes till he dressed to go on duty—I spoke to him and he left for duty soon after and in uniform—it is a constable's duty to go on duty with his boots cleaned; the men are inspected at the station to see that they are clean—that was the last I saw of him that night—I saw him next morning at 10. 30 or 10. 45—he seemed the same as usual—on that evening my wife showed me a pair of boots; I examined them, and on the heel of the left boot I saw some red hair and blood—after that my wife showed me a spot in the back garden—I uncovered the earth and found a whistle and a truncheon; I left them there and made a report at the same time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). From early morning of June 7th, when the information reached me, I was placed in charge of the elucida tion of this inquiry—I saw the prisoner at Notting Dale Station on June 8th about two p. m., and had a conversation with him, I speaking and he answering—I took it down during the time the conversation was occurring, and then read it over to him—this is it: "June, 8th, 1893.—George Cooke said: 'I am P. C. 385, serving in X division, and reside at 39, Silchester Road, with P. C. 224 Robinson and 320 McDonald. I have been in X division about five weeks, and was before that in E division at Bow Street for nearly three years, and before that in A division for six months, and in L division for about six months before that. I joined the Metropolitan Police 25th June, 1888. I know a woman by the name of Maud Cooke; the last address I knew her at was 39, St. Gabriel Street, St. George's Road, Lambeth, and before that 8, Tennison Street, Lambeth. She has also passed by the name of Smith. I first became acquainted with her about two years ago in the Strand. She had only</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189306260079"/>
               <p>been out a day or two as a prostitute. She told me her mother lived somewhere at Finchley or Holloway, and that she had been a barmaid at the Clarence Public-house, I believe, in the same neighbourhood. I have never seen any of her relatives. I have seen her about three or four times since I have been in this division, and I told Mrs. Robinson she was a prostitute. I got a note from her on Saturday night, and met her in Silchester Road. I had no quarrel with her. She was with a man named Atkins. I don't know what regiment. He had spurs on. I have not seen her since. About 9. 15 on Tuesday night I was at my lodgings, when Mrs. Frampton, a lodger, told me I was wanted. I went to the door, and saw a little girl, a stranger, and she said, "You are wanted up at the corner," and pointed towards the Prince of Wales's Feathers Public house. I went there, but saw no one. I knew I did not see the woman Maud that day or night. I came on duty at 9. 45 p. m., and was posted on the prison. I usually have another constable with me, but on this night I was alone until just after eleven p. m. when I was joined by Police constable Kemp. I was also alone from four a. m. to six am. on Wednes day. I heard nothing irregular and saw nothing irregular during Tuesday night, and the first I heard of the murder was at 10 a. m. yesterday, when I was called up to report. I had a letter from Maud on Tuesday last; I read it to Mrs. Robinson, and then burnt it. I began to write in reply, but did not finish the letter. Maud told me in the letter that if I was on night duty she would not come up. She asked me to write and tell her what time and place I could meet, her, that she would come to the Scrubbs station. She also referred to the man Atkins, and that I had given him my address. I went yesterday morning to the back garden at my lodgings, and buried a truncheon and whistle. I intended to do so before. I was afraid if the inspector came to visit my lodgings he might find them. I had heard the inspector sometimes visited the lodgings. I bought the truncheon for 6d. from Black Dick; he was dis missed over three years ago. I had the whistle from same man at the same time, and had them more than three years. The boots produced by Inspector Morgan are mine. I wore those boots on Tuesday night. I cannot account for what appears to be blood stains. I have not worn them since Wednesday morning. I cannot account for the stains on the leg of my trousers. I wore these trousers every night this week. I out my thumb on Monday; I was cutting some tobacco. I spoke to Mrs. Robinson about it. As to the £20 found in my possession, I have been saving it during the past two or three years. Police-constable Fred Knight, E, and Police-constable 210 E, have seen it in my possession. I don't know what the stain is on the towel found in my box; it has been on the towel over twelve months. I have had no quarrel or dis pute with Maud since I have been in this division, but we have differed once or twice through not keeping appointments. The last letter, on Saturday, was addressed from 39, St. Gabriel Street, signed "M." I swear positively that I have not seen the woman Maud since Saturday last, when she told me she was going to Boulogne. She did not ask me for any money. I cannot give any reason for suspicious circumstances mentioned by Inspector Morgan—viz., the woman Maud inquiring for me on Tuesday night, her body being found on the Scrubbs, and the sup posed blood stains on my boot and trousers, and why she was in this</p>

               <p>neighbourhood. I never saw or spoke to any woman on Tuesday night I never spoke to a woman near the prison between ten and eleven p.m. when a gentleman passed. No gentleman spoke to me. I have seen the statement made by P. C. Harris. I do not dispute it; but I saw no woman. I passed a police constable at the North Pole Public house, and I went in the direction he states I did.—Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">GEO. COOKE. "</hi>—that statement took some time to make—after he had signed it I left the station, and about six the same evening returned there and charged the prisoner with the murder of the woman—he made no reply—I made some measurements—it is 306 yards from the east or nearest corner of the prison to the place where the body was found—the length of the path between the posts is about 200 yards, rather more than less, from the stile to the Du Cane Road—from the body to the nearest footpath was sixty-three yards.</p>

It is a good job they did not catch me red handed"—later on in the day he said, "I must have been a fool to tell Mrs. Robinson about the letter I received.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector X</hi>). I am stationed at Notting Dale Police-station—on 5th May, this year, the prisoner was transferred to the X division, and remained discharging his duties up to 8th June—on that morning I went to his lodgings after he had left them—I saw Mrs. Robinson, his landlady—she showed me and I took away this pair of policeman's boots—I noticed some red stains on the left one—I gave them to Dr. Jackson—I went with Mrs. Robinson into the back garden; she pointed out a spot to me, and I raked up the earth with my hand and found a policeman's truncheon, No. 857 A, and whistle 4,067—I took them to the station, together with some articles of the prisoner's uniform, which I found in the kitchen—among the articles was this second truncheon, No. 385 X, and his own whistle—this truncheon and whistle were issued to him when he came into the X division, and he would have them in ordinary use—the other two articles had not been issued to him so far as I know—I handed both articles to Dr. Jackson—the prisoner remained at the station the whole of the 8th, and was charged about half-past six in the afternoon with this crime—next day, Friday, 9th June, he was brought before the Magistrate—Dr. Jackson and Inspector Morgan were shortly examined, and a remand was ordered—that was about one o'clock—at that time an application was made by the prisoner's, solicitor to permit some of his friends to see him—that was acceded to, and in order that he might see his friends more conveniently I took him into the police waiting-room at the Police-court, and stayed there with him for about twenty minutes—during that time no one came into the room—it was before his friends came—directly I got into the waiting room the prisoner began to speak to me—being under remand I cautioned him, but after my caution he went on making a statement to me—as soon as he left me, within ten or fifteen minutes of his making the statement (because his friends came in then) I began to write, and I wrote out his tatement, as far as I could remember it, in my pocket-book—it was quite</p>

               <p>fresh in my memory—as near as my memory serves me this is what the prisoner told me at this time—this note represents my memory now on the subject—it is word for word as he uttered it—when I cautioned him I told him not to make a communication to me unless he wished me to use it in evidence against him. (<hi rend="italic">The note was read as follows:</hi> He said, "I suppose it is no use trying to get out of it." I said, "I do not know." He said, "You have not got the right tool it was done with. It was not done with that truncheon at all." (He alluded to the one found in the garden). "It was done with the truncheon I was carrying, my ordinary truncheon. When I got round the prison that night I saw her. I said, 'What are you doing here?' She said, 'I am going to stop here until you go off duty. 'I said, 'There will be another policeman up here directly.' She said, 'I should like to see him, I would tell him something.' I said to her, 'You clear off.' She said,' I shall not. 'We stood arguing the point some time, and I went across the Scrubbs towards where she was found, thinking I should get out of her way; but she followed me. In going across I took my truncheon out of my pocket and put it up my sleeve. When near the spot where she was found I said to her, 'Are you going?' She said, 'No, I am going to stop and annoy you till Sunday, and then you can—yourself.' She then turned her head; I drew my truncheon and hit her on the side of the head. She fell down and never moved. I then hit her, I think, twice on the head, and once under the jaw. I then placed my foot on her neck, and kept it there for about five minutes. She never moved, but gave one gurgle. I then went back to the prison, and saw Police-constable Kemp, and told him I had been round the prison once, and we were very jolly all night afterwards. I thought nothing of killing her. I have been much happier since she has been dead than I was before. She was always annoying me, and I was in misery")—That was all said to me on the occasion referred to by the prisoner himself—nothing more was said in reference to the case—after he had made that statement I was still there when the young woman, the prisoner's friend, came, and they had an interview together—it was stated in the prisoner's hearing that they were sweethearts—while she was there Constable McDonald came in, and he had a conversation With the prisoner for about two minutes, I should think, and then left, leaving the young woman behind—she remained about ten minutes, and then left—I saw the prisoner put into a cell and left him, and then I commenced to make this note, which has been read—later that same day I took the note to Morgan, and I made a copy of it and sent it to the Commissioners of Police.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Carminia Road, Balham, and am draughtsman in charge, employed by the City of London Electric Lighting Company—in 1890 I lived at Ailsa Craig, Culverton Road, Balham—before that I had known Tassie—he had acted for me in a few Stock Exchange transactions—in 1890 he was carrying on business as an outside broker at 226, Piccadilly—he knew from prior conversations that I had got £1,100, nominal value, in Argentine Four and a Half per Cents. £500 in Uruguay bonds—two or three days before October 9th, 1890, he told me he had a friend who, owing to the default of the Argentine Government, could do something for me in respect of these bonds—the default of the Argentine Government was in respect to the falling in value of these bonds—I was to get money for the loan of them—he suggested he had a friend named Bradley, who would pay me £20 if I deposited the bonds with him—on 9th December I met Bradley at Tassie's office by appointment—I had the bonds with me—Bradley said he had a friend in</p>

               <p>Yorkshire named Stourton who wanted a temporary loan for three months, and if I would lend these bonds for that period I should get good interest—the bonds were to be deposited with Mr. Stourton's bankers as security for the loan he wanted—I never heard anything more at that time whether the arrangement between Bradley and Stourton had been concluded—I handed the bonds to Bradley, and received this receipt from Tassie at that interview: "Dear Sir,—I beg to acknowledge the receipt of the under mentioned securities, to be used <hi rend="italic">re</hi> loan to Stourton, £1,100 Argentines, £500 Uruguays.—<hi rend="smallCaps">TASSIE</hi>"—I didn't make any mention of what interest I was to have then—the same evening I received a note from Tassie, and went to his house, when he gave me the £20 I was to have for the loan of the bonds—it was arranged between Bradley, Tassie, and me that the loan of the bonds to Stourton was to be for three months, which would be up on 9th March—I saw Tassie several times before 9th March—on one occasion I asked when the bonds would be returned, and he said Bradley had had a letter from Stourton in Canada asking for a renewal of the bonds for another three months—I objected to it, and said I wanted the bonds back—Tassie said, "You need not bother, they will be all right"—after that I wrote to Bradley—I wrote this letter to Tassie on 11th March. (<hi rend="italic">Asking him to send coupons of the Argentine securities.</hi>)—I could not get any information—I was told this loan had been renewed; I objected to its being renewed; it was renewed against-objections from me—Tassie told me of the renewal—I received this letter from Tassie's clerk in answer to mine. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that Tassie could not answer it till Bradley returned from Yorkshire; that Tassie might come to town next day and would call and see him, but there was no hurry about the coupons</hi>)—I met Tassie about 13th March, and he told me he had sold the coupons and could only get £16—I got the £16—on 1st May I received this letter from Tassie, 2, Teviot Terrace. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the Bradley matter</hi> re <hi rend="italic">the Argentines and Uruguay bonds would be settled at three months' notice, Beaumont's matter</hi> re <hi rend="italic">the Greek bonds at about two months, and the Brewery matter was still open, and might be settled at any time</hi>)—the Beaumont and Brewery matters referred to other transactions I had with Tassie, and had nothing to do with this case—I was continually writing and asking for the Argentine and Uruguay bonds back—I used to go and see Tassie about it, and he referred me to Bradley, and when I saw Bradley he referred me to Tassie—I very seldom found them in when I went—on May 12th I wrote this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that he understood the loan had been renewed in connection with the bonds for three months, and that if such was the case he should be glad of interest as before, but that he could not get any definite information as to their detention</hi>)—I got no answer to that—I often tried to see Bradley, but saw him very seldom—he said everything was all right—I wrote to Tassie again. (<hi rend="italic">Stating that the bonds must be returned, and that he should take legal proceedings if they were not returned within ten days</hi>)—after that, and about July, 1891, I saw Bradley, and he said that he had given Tassie some money for me, and he said also that it was all right—he did not say what the money was for; it was after I had written to him about getting the money on the coupons, and after I got the £16—I then went to see Tassie, but did not get a penny from him—he referred me back to Bradley; he said, "Bradley</p>

I never saw Bradley before I met him at Tassie's office—my memory of the conversation is rather imperfect—I believe I was told he was a solicitor, and that he made some mention of his father selling an estate in Yorkshire—I was never, to my knowledge, told that that property was mortgaged to Mr. Stourton—he said he was going to get £1,000 from his father when the sale was completed, and I think £1,000 from Mr. Stourton—I did not know that Mr. Stourton was interested in the sale of the property; I never saw Mr. Stourton, and don't know why he should be interested—he did say that a friend of his in Yorkshire, Mr. Stourton, wanted a loan for two or three months until the sale of his (Bradley's) father's estate was completed—I lent the bonds because Bradley said they were to be deposited at Mr. Stourton's bankers—I said before the Magistrate, "I understood the defendant Bradley to say that the bonds would be deposited at Stourton's bankers"—some risk must be run if you want to raise money, but that was not the intention here, because I wished the bonds to be deposited at the bankers as security—I did not see Mr. Stourton before I saw him here—I made no inquiries of him; I may have written to him once—I only saw Mr. Bradley, sen., once—he was a solicitor, I believe—I saw him at 4, Winchester Street, in March, 1892—I said his son had got bonds of mine which I wanted back—I never mentioned a warrant, or of prosecuting his son—I had no idea of such a thing—I did not say that I understood he (the father) was a man of means—I had heard it mentioned that he was—I went to see him because I saw his name on the door at 4, Winchester Street—after serving a writ on Tassie, I had to stop on account of want of funds.</p>

I accepted a bill which Tassie drew on 11th December, 1890, at three months, for £550—I saw both prisoners about that time—I had only known Tassie two or three days, or very shortly before—Bradley I had known, I think, since 1885 or 1886—he was a solicitor—I did not know that Tassie had any profession, or that he was an outside broker; I knew nothing about him—shortly before the 11th, when they were together, I think I heard conversation about, and at the same time I think I saw, some Uruguay bonds—it was in Tassie's office at 226, Piccadilly, that I first heard of them—I might have heard of them a day before—the prisoners proposed that I should deposit them with my bankers and obtain a loan upon them from my bankers—I said I did not care about doing that sort of thing, and I did not have anything to do with the bonds—at that time the bonds were held up to me—I did not examine them; I have no doubt that they were bonds—they were never in my possession; I never did receive them in order to deposit them with my bankers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Stock Exchange, and carry on business at 24, Austin Friars—on December 11th, 1890, Tassie, whom I knew before, called on me with Bradley, whom I did not know before—at some previous time Tassie had been an outside broker—I am not sure if he was at that time—Tassie introduced Bradley as Mr. Frank Bradley, of Acton Hall, Normanton, Yorkshire, and said, "Mr. Bradley wants to sell some bonds"—they were mentioned as Bradley's bonds—I am not sure whether Tassie said they were Bradley's or whether Bradley said they were his own—I believed that statement—there were produced five Six per Cent Uruguay Bonds of the face value of £100 each, Nos. 8826, 15846, 22599, 22645, and 22598, and two Four and a Half per Cent. Argentine Bonds of the 1888 External Loan, of the face value of £500 each, Nos. 050952, 058953—they instructed me to sell them, and in consequence my manager put them on the market—the Uruguayan bonds, less my one-eighth commission, realised £288 2s. for cash—I found it impossible then to obtain a satisfactory price for the Argentines for cash, so I sold them for the next account—both the sales realised £846, less about £3 for charges; I think £843 18s.3d. was handed over—the proceeds of the sales were paid by cheques, one for £785 on December 11th, drawn to and endorsed by Frank Bradley, and the other for £15, drawn to Frank Bradley, and endorsed by both Frank</p>

               <p>Bradley and Tasisie—those cheques have since been returned by my bankers as paid—the £15 cheque was handed back to me by Tassie in part payment of some money he owed me; it was practically an advance I made in anticipation of the sale—after the Argentines had been sold for the next account, oh 2nd January, a balance was owing on the sale of £43 18s.3d., and on that date I paid it by a bearer cheque for £43 18s.3d. made out to Frank Bradley—he wrote asking me to hand a bearer cheque to his clerk—that concluded the transaction.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">urged that where an indictment alleged injury to property it was necessary, if the names of the persons to whom the property belonged were known, to set out those names in the indictment.

                  <hi rend="italic">contended that a charge might be added to that named in the committal if these facts were disclosed in the depositions; and that in a charge of conspiracy it was not necessary to set out any overt acts or details as to facts which could be given in evidence. If the offence were imperfectly stated in the indictment the defendant, could apply for particulars, and an order made for the prosecution to supply them. Here the offence, the conspiracy, was amply alleged in the indictment. It was not necessary to add the words</hi> "<hi rend="italic">with intent to defraud</hi>, "<hi rend="italic">as it was sufficient to state</hi> "<hi rend="italic">to make false entries.</hi>" <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">ruled that the indictment must be quashed. There having been a definite committal upon specific facts, and the prosecution having abandoned that, and substituted a general charge of conspiracy, the first Count was bad by reason of its vagueness, and because there was no committal to justify it; and the second Count could not be supported because it did not contain an allegation of intent to defraud.</hi>

I discovered the oakum at the top of the shed was on fire—the greater part of the top of the shed was burnt, and the oakum was very much destroyed—at the back of the shed are working-class dwelling-houses, and the people began to shift their goods when the fire was burning—I was present at the West Ham Petty Sessions on May 23rd, and in consequence of a statement made by the warrant officer there, I searched for the nozzle of the Union hose on the 24th, and found it under a stack of wood—I should think it had been cut off by a sharp knife—it is cut very straight.</p>

                  </hi>. I am single—I now live at the Mitre Hotel, Fish Street Hill—I had a son named Frederick Edmunds, he was born on January 23rd, 1890—I know the prisoner—in August last year I placed my child with her—she lived at 50, James Street, Deptford—she let two rooms—I had stayed there—I was to pay her 6s. a week for the child; I found clothes for it—it was in very good condition when I left it with her, very fat—I went to see it once a fortnight, but did not always see it—this (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) is a photograph of him it was taken twelve months ago last Whit Monday—that was about three or four months before he went to the prisoner—he was like that in August, as well and as fat—during August, September, and October I went to see him every fortnight—I noticed that he was getting much thinner—I said so to the prisoner—she said perhaps he was consumptive—he was not very clean; she always put that down to his playing about in the dirt—in November I was out of a situation, and went and stayed for ten days in the prisoner's house—I then owed her two weeks' money—on the 25th I went to a situation, and on the 14th January I returned to see the child—I did not see it between those dates—I noticed then that it was very thin, and looked very bad—it had a bruise on the cheek—I spoke to her about it; I said he looked very thin and ill, and I should take it to a doctor, and she said she would do go—I asked her how the bruise came; she said he was always falling about—I said I wanted to take him away; I wanted him done better for than she was doing—she said, "My husband will not allow you to take him away until you have paid the money you owe"—I had not paid anything between November and January; I was not able to; I was out of a situation; I owed her £3—I went again a fortnight later; he was quite as thin, and all out in sores; he had a black eye, and several of</p>

               <p>its teeth were missing—I asked her how he came by the black eye—she said he had fallen downstairs—I asked why his teeth were out—she said he must be shedding his teeth—I said that was quite impossible—I told her twice to take him to a doctor—she said she had done so—I did not give her the money, but she put down 6s. in the bill for the doctor; that was since Christmas, I think—I went again to see the child between January 7th and March 4th, but I am not sure whether I saw it—on the 20th March I went again—the child was then sitting in a chair, in a dreadful condition: he was all in sores, and its mouth ulcerated, and it was very dirty—I told her I should go to the doctor—she began crying, and said it was a great shame—I went to Dr. Hawkesworth, and returned and told her he would be there a little after ten, as he could not call before—I waited to see the doctor, but could not, as I had to get a train to my situation—on the 24th I went again, and took the child away to the infirmary at Greenwich; it was very ill—I told the prisoner I really could not afford 6s. a week; I paid her 5s., and she said, Very well, with the extra shilling she would get it some clothes—I got some boots for it, but he did not wear them; her baby did—she said they were too small for him—I noticed a change in the child's manner; it was very much frightened of me—I first noticed that in January, and it increased—the prisoner had seven children of her own; they never looked very clean; they were not so dirty as my child—they were fairly well dressed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Mrs. Frampton had charge of the child before the prisoner—I took it away from her—she did not give it up because I was unable to pay her—there had been a grievance about some money with her and the prisoner—I owed Mrs. Frampton about £1 15s.—when it went to the prisoner in August it had no change of clothes—I did not supply any more clothes until the end of November—I saw nothing to complain of up till Christmas, except it was getting very thin—from what I saw during the ten days I stayed there the child had plenty to eat—I was not there all day, I was there on Sundays—the prisoner's husband dined there on Sundays; the child dined with them, and was fed as the other children were—during the fortnight I was there I never saw any ill-usage of the child—I did not notice that the teeth were missing till 28th January—she said Dr. Hawkesworth said it had consumptive bowels—she did not tell me she had taken it to a doctor in August, but that she had a doctor to it then, and again in January—the teeth were not missing in November; I am perfectly sure of that—I did not wash the child myself, because she did not care for me interfering with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and now live at 8, Chapel Place, Greenwich—I formerly lived at 57, James Street, Deptford, next door to the prisoner—when I went there the deceased child was under the care of Mrs. Frampton; that was after last Easter twelvemonth—I first observed the child some few weeks after last Whitsun twelvemonth—the prisoner then had the care of it; it was taken away from Mrs. Frampton, she was a lodger in the house; it was then a fine plump child, one that anyone would be fond of—I did not speak much to the people; we were not neighbours; we kept to ourselves—the child was handed over to the prisoner prior to Whitsun twelvemonth—I know that she ill-used it; it was starved and cruelly neglected—some few weeks alter she had it I saw a great alteration in it, it was so thin and dirty—it did not run about</p>

               <p>as it used to—things got worse, it looked as if it wanted more care and attention; it got more dirty and thin—I never saw it beaten; I heard it—I heard it crying, and heard the prisoner's voice, and smacks, and telling it to leave off crying—that was on lots of occasions, early morning and very late at night—I saw it with two black eyes; that was before Christmas last—I asked the prisoner how it came by that, and she said it had fallen downstairs—I heard her beating the child a few days before it had the black eyes—the child's manner altered in the last; whenever I spoke to it it was very frightened of me—that had not been so under Mrs. Frampton—I did not mention that to the prisoner—I told her she should take it to a doctor, and she said she had done so—I saw the child the day it was taken to the infirmary; I assisted in taking it there—I undressed it; it was in a dreadful condition, so thin and dirty, I could not hold it—the head was very dirty; there were vermin on it—the prisoner's own children were in very good condition—this child never looked clean; it never looked as if it had a bath.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Frederick Miall, of 40, Edale Road, Rotherhithe—I was formerly a lodger of the prisoner's at 50, James Street; my husband took the apartments in the middle of August—I was at Holloway at the time; I had been in prison there for an assault—I went home on Tuesday, the 30th August; I then saw the child Edmunds; it was under the prisoner's care—it was then in a very nice condition—he was a fine little fellow; he looked all right, strong and healthy and stout—he ran about, and used to play along with my two little boys out in the yard occasionally—I was there just on four months; I moved from there about three weeks before Christmas Day—about four days after I came home from gaol I heard the child moaning and crying very much about six in the morning; the prisoner had got it shut up in the cupboard in her bedroom—I did not knock; I burst open her door, and saw it shut up in the cupboard—the prisoner had got her hand outside the cupboard, holding the door—I asked her what she meant by shutting the child up in the cupboard and ill-using it—she said he had messed his bed, and she was trying to correct him—I had heard it crying for a good ten minutes—she let it out of the cupboard, and I returned to my bedroom; the child was sobbing, and looked very frightened—I heard no more that day—after that I went into the country for about fourteen days, hopping; I came home about the end of September, about the 19th, I think—I then noticed a great alteration in the child, it seemed quite ill; it had got thin and very dirty—I said to the prisoner, "Don't this child look bad?"—she said, "Yes, he has had the measles since you have been away"—about three days after I returned I went into the yard and heard him screaming</p>

               <p>in the washhouse—I went in, I wanted to save the blow, but I could not; she hit the child across the mouth with the copper-stick—it is a stick in the shape of a rolling-pin, a good-sized stick; I think Mr. French made it; it is made of wood—as the result of the blow the child fell at my feet bleeding from the mouth; I went to hit the prisoner to protect the child; I said if I could get hold of her I would hit her, but she made her escape—I told her she ought to be ashamed of herself to beat the little child like that; she had better kill it right off at once—I noticed that its teeth were missing from its mouth; I could not say that that was from the blow—I went to answer a knock at the street door, and when I came back the child had gone into the kitchen, and the prisoner was bathing his mouth with cold water in a bowl—those were the only two occasions on which I saw her beat the child, but I have heard it crying, and have called out to the prisoner about it—I complained of her ill-using it so early in the morning, we could not get any sleep; it was in the next room to mine—after that it was moved—I have seen him in his bed; it was made up on a box with a piece of coal-sacking—he very seldom had a sheet; when he had it was very dirty—I have sent in food to the child, sometimes bread and butter and a drop of tea—I did not take them myself; I used to send my little boy George, eleven years old—I have seen the child in the washhouse, sitting on a little chamber, sometimes for an hour—I saw that on two or three occasions—he was not crying, he did not say anything; he had on a little brown coat, no other clothing, no socks or shoes—I have not seen the prisoner's children placed there—in consequence of what I saw I spoke to the child's mother, not to anyone else.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of 23, Douglas Street, Deptford—on 20th March the last witness called on me, and I went with him to 50, James Street—the child Frederick Edmunds was brought from the back part of the house to the front room, and I examined it—it was well clad—it had on a coat and waistcoat, and I thought it was very well clad as a rule—the prisoner took off the coat, waistcoat, and a shirt—they were all clean, as far as I could see—it looked as if it had been recently clothed—it looked as if it had been freshly washed—it was quite rosy as regards its cheeks, and the coat looked as if it had just been placed there and had not been adjusted—its body was very emaciated and thin—the head had a scaly eruption on it, on the side, and down to the ear, the result of eczema; that might be due to various causes, improper food, damp, want of sunlight and fresh air and good clothing, anything that would depress' the venera of the child—the lips were dry and cracked, the tongue was inflamed and sore, and the breath foetid—those were symptoms of great irritation of the stomach and bowels; that would be consistent with diarrhoea—I should say the child was very ill, as the result of what I have stated—the gums were firm and strong, the teeth were deficient—the age of the child would be against a natural shedding of the teeth; I could not say it was from a blow—the right arm was swollen and red, I could not say from what—the feet were also swollen—I examined the anus; the lower bowel was protruding, and the bowels were red, inflamed and ulcerated—the child was weighed in my presence—the average weight of a child of three years would be about 30 or 40 lb.—I attribute the condition of the child to prolonged irritation of the stomach and bowels, produced by the food not being of a nature for the child's power to assimilate—I could not say how long that had been going on—I asked the prisoner when she had had a</p>

I am junior resident medical atten<lb/>dant at the Greenwich Union Infirmary—the child Edmunds was brought there by the mother and Mrs. Byrne on 24th March as an urgent case—it was very ill indeed; it was suffering from acute bronchitis—that would be from the effects of cold—I cannot recollect whether it was wrapped in a blanket or anything light—its body was very dirty; it had many vermin on it; there were many sores and scratches on the body—the head had a great quantity of vermin and nits—the body was covered with them—the lips were ulcerated—the tongue cracked and brown—there was a red swelling on the right arm, a swelling of both feet—it was very much wasted, and was very dangerously ill—three teeth were missing, the right upper cen<lb/>tral and two lower; it weighed 181b. 2 ox.—that would be about 8 lb. short of the right weight, after making all allowance—I did not observe the bowels; they were not protruding on admission—it did not appear to be suffering from any bowel complaint at the time—the child was admitted at once, and remained till it died; it was under my care a month—at first it slightly improved, then got gradually worse, and died on 22nd April—I made a post-mortem—the body was very much wasted, it contained very little fat; it weighed 16 lb. 6 oz.—the skin was of a waxy colour, the legs also; there was a small sore on the right parietal bone of the head, and two small sores on the right wrist—the hair had been cut close—there were two small ulcers on the lower lips—the two central incisors and the right upper central incisor were missing—the brain substance was normal—the bowels were perfectly normal but enaemic; that would be due to the illness and weak condition of the child; it was suffering from rickets; that is a constitutional disease, due to a deficiency of the natural salts of the bones—the condition of the child showed that it had been neglected, and the food had not been of a proper character.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in Court and heard Dr. Semple's evidence—I do not agree with the cause he has given; I do not agree that the child had eczema—I think it had chronic diarrhoea after its admission; a day or two after, at all events—consumptive bowels is commonly termed rickets—no solid food was given it in the hospital—it was too ill to</p>

               <p>assimilate the food given to it—vermin would not be more likely to come to a child in a delicate state, not if it was kept clean—it is not more difficult to keep a weak child clean than a healthy one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Vermin are the result of dirt—when the child was in the infirmary I observed that it was frightened when I or the nurse approached it; that was not the result of weakness; I differ from Dr. Semple as to that—I have seen a great many children, and I have a great many under my care, and I have never seen one so frightened as this one.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the prisoner</hi>). My husband, Alfred French, and I live together at 50, James Street—I had this little boy Frederick Edmunds to take care of in August—he became ill with measles within two or three days after I had him—he had diarrhoea very bad before I had him, and after I took him—he got better from the measles, but he was always very poorly and hanging about, he never seemed to be lively after it—I can't exactly ray how many days the diarrhoea lasted, but I had him some time with it—I remember his falling downstairs; that was shortly after Christmas—it was a very foggy afternoon—it was before the New Year—when he fell he hurt his mouth and his legs; he hurt his lip; it knocked against his teeth—he was very weak on his legs—I took him to see Dr. Hawkesworth on Monday morning in the new year—I can't exactly say how many times I took him to Dr. Hawkesworth—I know I went two or three times—my next-door neighbour, Mrs. Arnold, persuaded me to take him—it is not true that I hit the child with a stick, not at any time—I had seven children living at home—this child had his meals along with my children in the week—on Sunday the children generally had theirs when I and my husband and my big daughter had finished—this child had the same food that my children had—they all shared alike—on the 20th March, when the inspector came, my little boy, Charles, was ill—he had been very ill for some time, but not to lay up—he was ill for three weeks after the inspector came—my little girl, eight years old, was also very poorly—I gave the deceased some port wine—I used to get twopenny worth of a morning and give him a drop in a tea-spoon</p>

               <p>—I did that several days—no one asked me to do it; but one evening it did not seem well, and the mother sent and got him a drop, and of course I did the same—as long as he was well enough I used to let him play with my children in the yard—Dr. Hawkesworth told me to give him plenty of bread and milk, which I did—I used to get half-a-pint of milk in the morning, and between one and two a little more, and sometimes some mutton broth—he was always ravenous—I used to send for more milk for him in the evening—he had more than a pint a day—<hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever beat him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I might have just tapped him on the hands, he was a very dirty child, but not to hurt him—my husband generally came home between six and seven, and stayed at home till about ten—then he used to go to the end of the street, and back again about eleven, or shortly after—the child slept in my bedroom, with me and my Husband And my baby.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant V</hi>). About eleven on May 25th I went to a little general shop in the Three Rope Yard Rails, Woolwich, kept by Jackson, I believe—I believe there was a man there—I have never seen him there, and I could not speak positively—on entering the shop with another officer I saw Jackson—I said, "We are police officers; I want to speak to you about some gold rings"—she said "Yes, what is the description of the gold rings you are inquiring about?"—I said, "One is a diamond ring, and the other has a red stone centre with a large pearl each side"—she said, "I have had nothing of that description"—I said, "Have you bought or received any rings during the past four months?"—she said, "No, I have not"—Rutherford, the other officer, said, "Have you bought any bracelets?"—she hesitated, and said, "I did buy two bracelets"—I said, "Who did you buy them of?"—she said, "A man I don't know"—I asked her if she would show me the bracelets—she went into a bedroom—I was going up, and I met her coming out of the room door—she said, "These are the bracelets I bought"—I said, after looking at them, "From a description I have in my pocket I believe this property belongs to Colonel Russell, and I shall search your house"—she said, "Very well, you can do so"—I examined three boxes and a chest of drawers in the bedroom, and found three gold bracelets, a silver one, a buttonhook, two rings, two brooches, and "a necklace—I said, "Can you account for these?"—she said, "Yes, I can, for everything there; it belongs to me"—at this moment a man named Jackson, now dead, entered the room, and said, "What are you looking for?"—I said, "Stolen property"—he said, "Everything in this house and everything in this room belongs to me, and it is bought and paid for"—I was informed he was her husband, but since then I have heard something else—after further search I said I should take them to the station, and they would be charged with stealing and receiving—when charged at the station they made no reply—three or four days after the remand the man died in prison—the shop is a small general one, for the convenience of the lodging-houses all along there.</p>

               <p>cupboard at 6. 45, and found five or six pieces of greasy paper and some cotton-wool on the floor—that cupboard was not used for anything—the paper and wool were not there before—there were also some large pieces of wood there—I took the paper and wool out and put them in the yard of No. 120—on the same afternoon I was going towards the back premises and saw smoke issuing from the back window of the workshop—I said to the prisoner, "Where is that smoke coming from?"—he said, "I could not tell you"—I went into the workshop soon afterwards and found the highest corner of the back workshop on fire—shavings and a box of shellac were burning—the prisoner followed down behind me, and said, "I wonder how this has happened?"—(there is a boiler there; that is where we carry on our work—there had been a fire burning that morning, it was lit about ten o'clock, but it was put out at 10. 30, in consequence of not having materials to get on with the employment)—I said, "I do not know, sir; I was here half an hour ago, it was all safe then—it had gone four o'clock then—on Friday, the 26th, I saw the prisoner near the cupboard when I returned from dinner, about 3. 30—as I came to the front door he was in the act of leaving the cupboard—about seven p. m. a friend of mine, Arthur Beard, came to see me, and soon afterwards we looked into the cupboard, and I saw paper and cotton waste just the same as I had Been it before, and the same wood—there was a basket and a barrel; they had been there several days, and a little case—the prisoner came upstairs into the workshop, and said, "Have you very nearly finished your work?"—I said, "Yes, sir"—he said, "I promised you I would give you a night to go to the Canterbury," and put his hand in his pocket and gave me &amp; two-shilling piece and a sixpence—about that time Seddon, another assistant, came in, and he gave him a shilling and sent him out to buy a shillingsworth of stamps, and told me to get away as quick as I could and wash myself, or I should be too late, and he would call me when he was ready—I went to my house, next door but one, and in two or three minutes he called me, and said, "Albin, you can come and lock up now"—he came outside the front door, pulled it to with his hand, and said, "You can lock the padlock now"—I said, "Had not I better go and look round, sir, as usual?"—he said, "No; you can get away"—I locked the padlock, and took the key, and was going—he said, "Will you have a drink of beer before you go?" and Beard and Seddon went with us to the public-house, and he treated us to three halves of mild and bitter, and he had a pint of beer—he left us there—he was in a very excited condition, and seemed to be very much trembling—Beard went out after him, and came back to me—Beard and I went back to No. 120, and got up a ladder—I carried the ladder across the roof and put it down to the skylight of the back workshop, No. 118, and got in at the skylight—Beard went down the ladder first, and I followed to the cupboard door, and saw a light before opening the door, because it was very badly fastened—when I opened it I saw the paper and the cotton waste and the wood as I had previously seen them, and this box was placed in addition just inside the door, in the centre of which a candle was burning, and two pieces of paraffin wax were laid on the top, two bottles of oil, and some cotton waste and paper, and a parcel of shellac, which burns—I fetched a constable in uniform—Beard was off</p>

               <p>duty at that time—on the same night I went upstairs with Inspector Croston and examined the premises—there was a room in which cotton waste had been kept in a box similar to this, only longer; the box had been moved and some of the cotton waste was gone—the prisoner was the only person left on the premises when I left to go to my own house to wash myself, but Seddon was on the premises when Beard and I got through the skylight—there were inflammable materials in the workshop upstairs, such as oil and shellac—it is a wooden staircase, forming the top of the cupboard—the state of the business at that time was very bad, and the prisoner told me to say if "so-and-so" called that he was away in Manchester—"so-and-so" were creditors—some creditors called and I carried out the directions; but he was not in Manchester, he was upstairs, and after they had gone he called me up—he asked me on two occasions if I was insured—he said, "It will be well to do so, because if this place catches light the whole row of houses will go down"—they are old houses; you can go from one end of the roofs to the other—about October or November last, before I went into his employ, I was awoke between two and 2. 30 by smoke coming in at my window; that was at No. 119—I shifted into No. 120 afterwards—I looked out at the window and saw a quantity of smoke and flame issuing from his back window, first floor—I gave an alarm and then went there, but could not get in for the smoke; it was put out by the fire brigade—the prisoner lived at Church Road, Peckham.</p>

               <p>the night of the 24th or 25th—the public-house where the prisoner left me is about thirty yards from his house, and I had the key of the padlock—there was between five and eight minutes from the time I locked the padlock and the prisoner leaving me, so that in ten minutes I could have had my drink and gone back and got into the house—I went over the roofs and got in at the skylight, instead of opening the padlock, "because the prisoner might have come back—he has come back two or three times and come to my house and asked me for the key, and I did not know whether he would come back that night; that was why I took Seddon—I do not know Field or Fulbrook, but I know that he prosecuted them at the London Sessions, and they were sentenced—I do not know that Seddon also robbed him; I do not know that some persons have threatened to do him an injury in consequence of this prosecution—he did not say to me, "What is that smoke coming out of the back works?"—I said so to him—three bags of shavings had been thrown on the coals, but the coals were quite dead; they had not been burning up to three o'clock—I raked the fire out at 10. 30, and he went away for some glue; it is not the fact that he saw the shavings and called my attention to them—he told me to put an indiarubber pipe on—Seddon had gone to the Old Kent Road—he came back afterwards—I did not hear the prisoner say to him, "Joe, you have been trying to set fire to the place"—I do not know what he said upstairs, but Seddon came down and told me the governor had said something to him—there was no fastening to the cupboard; the door could come open—when I saw him leaving the cupboard at 3. 30 I did not look into it—I thought I would look later on, because he said, "Come and get on with the work"—I did not know Fulbrook till Seddon told me about him.</p>

                  </hi> (171 <hi rend="italic">M</hi>). I am a friend of Albin—on Friday, 26th May, about seven p. m., I was off duty, and I went to see him at 118, Snowsfields—about a quarter to eight, when the prisoner went upstairs to write a letter, as he said, Albin showed me in the cupboard underneath the stairs a quantity of paper, some wood, a' wicker basket, and a barrel—soon after the prisoner came downstairs and said to Albin, "I promised you if you worked hard to-day I would treat you to the Canterbury," and at the same time he gave him a two-shilling piece and a sixpence—Seddon was there; the prisoner told him to go out and get some stamps, and at the same time he gave him some money—then Albin and I went out, leaving the prisoner on the premises alone, as far as I knew—I came back with Albin, whom I heard the prisoner call—I saw him shut the door and Albin lock it—as we moved away from the door towards the public-house we met Seddon coming back with the stamps—we all went to the Rose Public-house, where the prisoner treated us—he appeared to be very agitated, and was trembling very much and perspiring—he left us there, and went away—I followed him for a short distance, and saw he was going towards London Bridge—I went back with Albin to</p>

               <p>his house, and with him and Seddon got in at the skylight of 118, and went downstairs to the cupboard—before opening the cupboard door I saw the light from the candle coming through the cracks in the cupboard—we opened the cupboard door and found the box and the candle, cotton waste, paper, and bottles of oil, and tightly wrapped in a piece of news-paper I found a square cardboard box with holes in it, and containing about a pound of gunpowder—that cardboard box was about nine inches above the wooden box, lodging between the wicker basket and the stairs—the wicker basket was at the back of the cupboard, close against the stairs, and the box was close in front of the basket—the whole thing was in such a position that if the contents of the box had caught fire the gunpowder and the stairs must have been ignited—I sent Albin off to find a uniform constable, and 426 came—I waited till the inspector came before putting out the candle, so that he saw it exactly as I had found it, only that the door was open—when he came he put out the candle and removed all the things to the Police-station—that same evening I and Sergeant Croston and Seddon went to 115, Shoumert Road, Peckham—Seddon knocked at the door, which the prisoner opened, and then we walked in and arrested him—I said, "You know who I am?"—he made no reply—Croston told him the nature of the charge, and he said, "I know nothing of the matter"—at the station he told me he was insured in the Sun Fire Office—it was about ten minutes after the prisoner left that we got into the premises—I am sure there was no light burning in the cupboard when I left the premises before that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was shown this cupboard on the night of the 26th there was a quantity of wood there, but not the candle or the gunpowder, that I am aware of—the cupboard was pulled open, and I saw it all at a glance—I looked in, and, so far as I could see, there was no gunpowder—I am positive the candle was not there, nor the box; but this wood was there; this paper was strewed about; this wicker basket and this barrel were there—that was at a quarter to eight when I had the passing glance—I got to the Rose about ten minutes past eight as nearly as possible—the Rose is about thirty yards from the prisoner's warehouse—between a quarter to eight and the time we got to the Rose we stopped in the warehouse some considerable time—the prisoner had not come downstairs when we saw this paper in the cupboard, and after he came down with the letters we stopped for some time—I went into Albin's house when he went to wash; and I came back with him, and went close to the warehouse door—I am positive the prisoner pulled it to, and Albin turned the key in the lock and put it into his pocket, and we went to the public-house—we were there about two minutes, I should say—the prisoner's proper way home would be by train from London Bridge Station—he would take five or seven minutes, as he was walking, to get from the warehouse to London Bridge Station—I watched him going along towards London Bridge till he was quite out of sight, going in that direction—I then returned to Albin's house—Albin first suggested getting through the skylight, and I thought it would be best—I have been there about six or seven times since Albin has been there, and I have had friendly conversations with the prisoner—he knew perfectly well I was a police officer—I told him I had been watching and making a raid on a</p>
