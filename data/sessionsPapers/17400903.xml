            . I was Mr Ithill's Apprentice, and was packing up Goods in the Shop, at the time these 2 Hats were stole. Mrs Cross sat near the Window from whence they were taken; and while I was busy, she cryed out, - a Man has taken a Hat, and has run away with it! I ran to the Door, but saw no body near; She made a Motion with her hand, to shew me which way he went, so I looked towards Angel-Street, and saw a Boy, (the Prisoner Dennet) putting something under his apron. I pursued him 4 or 5 Doors up Angel-Street and seized him. I asked him what he had got under his Apron, and he told me he had nothing; but upon my turning up his Apron, there were these two Hats. I am sure they are Mr Ithill's, for here are the Marks which I put upon them; and I am positive Dennet is the Boy I took them from; for I took the Goods from him, and brought him back to our Shop, and as I passed by the Barber's Shop at next Door, the Barber called me in, and told me he believed he had got the Boy's Confederate; so I took both the Man and the Boy into our Shop, and charged a Constable with them. We asked them if they knew one another, and they said no, they did not; and denied that they knew any thing of the matter, only the Boy said, he picked them up under the Shop-Window. Upon this we carried them before the Lord-Mayor, and being obliged to wait a little while for a Hearing, we went to the Fleece Alehouse , and there the Prisoner Cane desired us to speak favourably of him before my Lord-Mayor, and then he would go to Sea directly, and would never be seen again here. The Barber asked him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030003"/> twice if his name was not Perkins ? He told him, it was not. Yes it is, says the Barber, and you * was tryed last Sessions for stealing wet Linnen. He was asked again what his name was, and he said it was Thomas Cane.</p>

            . I am a Peruke-maker, and live next Door to Mr Ithill. I saw the 2 Prisoners, the Man and the Boy, talking together about 2 Minutes at my Window, and very soon after this the Man (Cane) chopp'd into my Shop, and seemed to be very much surpriz'd, which gave me a suspicion that he was a Thief. I had seen Mr Ithill's Man run past my Window, and seeing him come back again with the Boy, I asked him to come into my Shop, for I believed I had got the Boy's Companion. I did not see any thing of the Robbery, only the Man came into my Shop in a Flurry, and pull'd off his Wig, and desired me to comb it, tho' it looked as if it had been just comb'd, and having seen him talk to the Boy but a little before at my Window, it made me suspect they were Confederates.</p>

I returned in about an Hour, and miss'd 4 d. On Sabbath-Day following I got up early in the Morning, and saw there was Six-pence Half-penny in the Till ; when Afternoon-Sermon was over there was Three-Pence gone. About six o'Clock (the same Day) I call'd my Son, and we went down Stairs, and we marked two Six-pences, and eighteen Pennyworth of Copper, which we put into the Till. On Monday Morning I got up at 5 o'Clock, and then we miss'd 1 s. and 2 d. of the marked Money. After this I went out, leaving the Prisoner alone in the Shop; and I sent a Person to buy several Things, for which I sent home mark'd Money. Out of this Money I miss'd 21 d. when I returned. Then I sent for Mr Makepeace the Constable, and having taken the Prisoner up into my Dining-Room, I tax'd him with having wrong'd me, and told him I had miss'd Money several Times. He deny'd all; but upon obliging him to pull out what Money he had in his Pocket, I found a Shilling and a Sixpence in Silver, and 11 Halfpence of the mark'd Money. He had more Money upon him, but it not being marked, I cannot swear to it. I then carried him before Sir

            . Mrs. Hollingsworth sent me, on Whitsunday last, for a Bundle she had left at Mr Wakefield's in Shoreditch. I don't know what was in it, but it was a pretty large bundle. I took it from Mr Wakefield's, and was to call for another, in Little Moorfields, which belonged to another Woman. As I was going over Moorfields, I met the Prisoner in a light cap'd Coat, and another Man in Soldier's Cloaths, and they went with me to the House where I was to call for the other Parcel. The biggest Bundle (which was Mrs Holling sworth's) I put upon my Head; the other I carried under my Arm, in the Lappet of my Coat. The Prisoner would have taken the little one to have carried for me, at the House from whence I took it, but I would not let him have it. However they followed me, and the Prisoner said again - Comrade, you are loaded, I will carry one parcel a little way for you. Well, Comrade, says I, if you will, I will let you; and so he took Mrs Holling sworth's Parcel, which weighed (I believe) about 40 or 50 lb. and came with me from Little Moorfields to Cripplegate Church, where he bid me go along, and then he slipped away from me. I thought he must go up Whitecross Street, so I turn'd up there, and enquired after the Prisoner. A Man told me he had seen such a Person, and if I made haste I should catch him; but I saw nothing of him, 'till he was taken up at Whitehall; which was about a Fortnight after this happened. I have never set my Eyes upon the things since, nor would the Prisoner confess any thing when he was apprehended, but he is the man, - I am positively sure he is the Man.</p>

I missed it between 6 and 7 in the Evening, and saw it but the Moment before it was gone. The Prisoner was drinking out of it; and while he had it before him, my Wife (who had been abroad) was brought home ill; I went to the Door, and took her in my arms to carry her into the House, and in the mean time the Prisoner went away with the Tankard. I missed both him, and That, the Moment he went out; and asked the People in the House, if they had taken it away. They all said, they knew nothing of it; but while I was looking about for it, a Boy came running into the House, and told me, the Prisoner was stopped about 200 Yards off, with my Tankard upon him. I went out, and found the People had stopped him with it, and had seen my Name at the Bottom of the Tankard. 'Tis in the Officer's Hands, and he is here.</p>

               <p>Mr Culling. The Prisoner owned he took it out of my House, and I said to him, - Sirrah, how dare you come in to rob me, when I have used you so well? Why really, says he, I did not come into the House with such a Design , but I was forced upon it. I remember I saw a Man and a Woman sitting with him; and the Woman had a Hat on, and she had a black Eye; so I asked him who they were that forced him to it? No; he would not tell, he would rather die than tell, - he would rather chuse to be hang'd: the Man and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030006"/> Woman were gone, and he would not tell who they were.</p>

               <p>Mr Culling. When I carry'd my Wife in, they were with him; when I came into the Room again, they were all gone. The Tankard is worth about 9 or 10 L.</p>

            . I was going down St Catherine's-Lane , and about three Doors down the Lane on the Left-hand, a Woman said, - there's a Man coming along, who has stole a Pot, or a Tankard. I said, - then Faith he shall not carry it off, if he has stole it. So the Wind blew hard, and the Bell had just rung 7 o'Clock, and I pursued the Prisoner. He went up to a Gate, and took the Tankard out of his Breeches. What have you got there, says I? Nothing, (cry'd he) but what's my own. What's your own, says I to him, why you don't look like a Man that is Master of such a Piece of Plate, and swearing an Oath, - I hope 'tis no Offence, - By G - , says I, you shall not carry it off, so I clapp'd hold of the Waistband of his Breeches with one Hand, and twisted the Tankard out of his Hand, with the other. Then I hauled him out to the middle of the Lane, and called out, Stop Thief! I attacked him in this Affair, and held him fast, till one Mr Atkins came up to my Assistance, and then we carry'd him to an Alehouse; and People coming about us, says I to them, - Here's a Man has stole a Tankard, - I believe 'tis Culling's, and I took it out of his Breeches. Upon this a Man examined it, and found Culling's Name at the Bottom. This is the very same Tankard which I took out of that Fellow's Breeches. The People at the Alehouse ask'd him how he came by it? He then said he did not know; but when he was before Mr Justice Richards, he said he found it. He was ask'd, where he found it? He said, at first, he found it in his Breeches, and afterwards, that a Woman gave it him. Aye, said the Justice, she was a mighty kind Woman indeed, to make you a present of a Silver Tankard, which was none of her own! Pray what Woman was this? He would not confess who gave it him, but said he would sooner die, than tell who she was. His Examination was taken down in Writing, and he might have signed it if he would, but he would not.</p>

He held up the Tankard, and I thought she was only struggling with him for some of the Beer; but Mrs Mead telling me the Man had stole the Tankard, and desiring me to go and help Joe, I went to her Assistance, but she had got the Tankard from him, before I laid hold of him. With her Assistance we carry'd him into the Thistle and Crown Alehouse; there I saw Mr Culling's Name upon the Bottom of the Tankard, and he, being sent for, owned it. The Prisoner seemed to be a little in Liquor, and made some frivolous Excuses: He said he did not take it himself, but that a Woman gave it him; and he would sooner die than discover who the Woman was.</p>

Mrs Parker, the Prisoner, carry'd me there, - I was not rightly in my Senses, but was a little Matter in Liquor. I met her between 10 and 11 at Night, (to the best of my Knowledge) and staid with her till between 9 and 10 the next Morning; and while I was with her, I lost a Silver Watch, Chain, and Seal. I am sure I carry'd it into the Room with me, and to my certain Knowledge I had it in the Room, for I looked at it at one Clock, (in the Night) and said I would go Home, but she would not let me, - she said it was too late. So I slept there, and miss'd my Watch between 7 and 8 in the Morning. I met her that Night at a Beer-house opposite her Lodgings, and there was a Man in her Company who came with us to her Room; I slept upon her Bed, and the Man staid in the Room, till between 6 and 7 in the Morning. I don't know that the Prisoner took my Watch, - but I am sure I lost it in her Room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he was not very drunk, when he came to me at the Alehouse ? And whether he did not pawn his Buckles, because he had no Money after the Gentleman and he came to my Room? Mr Mooney is no Stranger to me; he and I have been acquainted these two Years and a half.</p>
               <p>Mooney. I have known her these two Years; and though I lost my Watch in her Room, I can't say who took it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He was very drunk when he came to my Room, and I would not let him go Home for Fear he should be robb'd. I have been acquainted with him a great while - to my Disadvantage.</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. (Constable and Pawnbroker.) On Monday Seven-night (about half an Hour after nine in the Morning) the Prisoner came to me with this Watch, to pledge for three Guineas. I asked her whose it was? she said it was her own. I told her, I supposed she did not wear a Silver Watch and Chain; but she still said it was her's, - she should fetch it again, and what was that to me. I told her I must know who was the Owner of the Watch, and where he liv'd, before I parted with it: and then she said, she was at present with a Gentlewoman in Piccadilly , who knew where she liv'd. That (says I) is no Satisfaction to me. Why then (reply'd she) 'tis my Husband's Watch, and he is gone to Sea, - give me the Watch again. I refused to do it, and took her before Mr Justice Frasier, where she said the Watch belonged to one Mooney a Cabinet-maker, and that Mooney had been gone to Sea a Month. She was asked where she lived? She told us she liv'd in Long-Acre : upon which I offered to go to Long-Acre, to enquire after her, but she then said she liv'd in Parker's-Lane, and finding I was resolved to go to her Lodgings, she desired to go with me, and said she would go to an Alehouse , and would send for the Person who owned the Watch. Then it came out, that the Owner of it was in Town, and lived by the New-Church in the Strand; but when we came to the New Church , she could not shew me where he lived. Prithee, says I, let's go and see if you can find out your own Lodgings. Accordingly she went with me, and would have carried me into an Alehouse , in her Neighbourhood, ( Parker's-Lane ) but seeing a Parcel of mean People there. I refused to go in; and so she went with me to the House where she lodged, and her Landlady informed me, that the Prisoner had lived there upwards of a Quarter of a Year, and that this was but the second Quarter. While we were talking together, a Messenger came from the Alehouse over the Way, and told the Prisoner there was one at their House desired to speak with her. I insisted upon it, that whoever wanted her, must come over to her; upon which Mooney came and said, - He had lost his Watch, and that it was picked out of his Pocket the Night before. Then I carried the Prisoner before Mr Frasier, and Mooney made the same Information he has made here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask Mr Brown, whether Mooney was not desirous to recal what he had said, knowing he had done me Injustice?</p>
               <p>Mr Brown. So far from that, that he insisted upon her having taken it; and she said, Mooney was a Villain, and had ruined her; and if she had taken 10 Watches from him, he ought not to have sworn against her. She called him ill Names, and he said, she had brought it all upon herself.</p>
               <p>Defence. Last Sunday was Se'nnight at Night, Mooney came to the Alehouse where I was drinking, and I was surprized to see him so fuddled; and not having seen him for a fortnight before, - pray sit down says I, you are very welcome. I was just going home to bed, but he was resolved to drink before he stirred; so he called for a Pot of Beer, and not having any Money, he took out his Knee-Buckles and pawned them for the Beer. Then we went to my Room, and had another Pot there. About One he wanted to go Home; I thought it was too late, and as he was in drink, I perswaded him to lie down. Then says I, my Dear, I want a pair of Shoes, lend me a Crown to buy a pair. Dear Nanny says he, You know I have no Money; - I pawned my Knee Buckles to pay for the Beer: However (says he) take this Watch, and pawn it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030008"/> for a Guinea; for I can't go home without my Buckles. Ask him if I have not had this Watch in my Custody very often, before that Time.</p>
               <p>Mooney. Yes, she has often had it; and she might have made bold with it before, as she has done now. - I missed it about 8 o'clock on Monday Morning; and she said, she knew nothing of it. The other Man who had been with us, was gone, when I missed it, and she never pretended that He might take it; she only said, she would go out and enquire of Him, if he knew where it was: and accordingly she went out, about the Time she offered it to Mr Brown, and I waited for her Return till between 9 and 10. <rs id="t17400903-7-verdict52" type="verdictDescription">

On the 29th of July last, 2 Gentlemen came who were Customers to my House, and called for a Tankard of Beer, in a little Yard before the Door. I served them in a silver Tankard, and when they had drank the Liquor, they called for more; I filled it again, and the Prisoner (a <rs id="t17400903-8-deflabel58" type="occupation">Chairman</rs>

The Gentlemen went away, and left the Prisoner in the Yard; and in an Hour's Time I missed the Tankard. I was in a fright about it, and remembred that no body else had been at the House. By and by, (soon after this) in comes one of the Gentlemen who had drank out of the Tankard; I asked him if he knew any thing of it? He told me it was left with Harry Clark (the Prisoner) upon the Bench in the Yard. So the next Morning I went to the Prisoner's Lodgings, but he was gone out to work; then I went directly to the Pawnbrokers, and desired them to stop it if it should be offered. But hearing nothing of it, I went to the other Gentleman who had been in Company, and he likewise told me, the Tankard was left upon the Bench with Harry Clark. At 8 o'clock the next Morning the Prisoner came to Breakfast, and I asked him about it. He owned it was left with him, - but d - mn your Tankard, (said he) am I obliged to look after it? Do you think I have it? This made me dubious about taking him up; so I advertised it, and was in hopes it would be brought me for the Sake of the Reward. Four or 5 Days after I spake to him again, and told him, I would not expose him, but that I had reason to suspect him. He utterly denied all, and asked me what Business I had at his Lodgings without a Constable ? Why, Harry, says I, I only come to ask you about it, - I hope that every one who comes to ask for you, don't come with a Constable. After all the Enquiry I could make, I could hear nothing of it; so upon the 8th of August I got a Warrant, and took the Gentlemen and the Prisoner before Mr Justice De Veil , who clear'd them, and said he must commit the Prisoner. When the Prisoner heard this, he took me into the Yard, and asked me what I intended to do; and said, he hoped I would not send him to Prison, and declar'd to me that he had not the Tankard. I told Colonel De Veil that I missed him and the Tankard together, and that no soul came to the House, but these People, before I missed it. He desired me (if I could) to put off his Commitment for 2 or 3 days; I told him if he would let me have my Tankard again, I would beg he might be only sent to the Round-House. Then he wanted me to put it off for a Fortnight; and upon my telling him I could not do it, he said he would give me 2 Guineas down, and a Note of Hand for the rest; but upon my relating this Proposal to Colonel De Viel, he told me I must not accept of it.</p>

             and I went to the Prosecutor's House, and we had a Tankard filled twice, and asked the Prisoner to drink. When we came away, we left the Tankard upon the Bench in the Yard, at a little Distance from the Prisoner, and there was no one but he in the Yard. We did not speak to him to take care of it, for we imagined he would do it, as he drank Part of the Beer, and was one who constantly used the House. About an Hour afterwards I came back to Mr Minton's; he asked me about the Tankard, and I told him I set it down within 5 or 6 Foot from the Prisoner, upon the Bench.</p>

             . On the 29th of July , in the Evening, I was call'd off with a Horse-Jobb to Clare-Market : when I went away with the Jobb, I left the Prisoner and the two last Witnesses, drinking out of a Tankard in the Yard. When I came back again, the two Men were gone, and there was no body in the Yard but the Prisoner. My Partner wanting to hang the Horse to a Nail over the Bench where the Prisoner sat; and it being above the Prisoner's Head, my Partner desired him to get up, that he might hang the Horse up. He<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030009"/> made no Answer at all; so my Partner spoke to him a second Time, and then he only slid his Backside along the Bench, and leaned his Head on one Side, that we might reach to the Nail. I did not see the Tankard at all; but I heard him acknowledge at the Justice's, that the two Men left it with him, and he offered to pay for it in my Hearing.</p>

             , Tomes's Partner, gave the same Account.</p>
               <p>Defence. I own I used this Man's House, and that these two Men had been drinking that Evening in the Yard. I had been drinking myself, and came and laid my self down on the Bench, and these Men asked me to drink out of their Tankard. I drank most of the Beer myself, and gave the Tankard into one of their Hands; then I went to sleep again, and they went away without saying any Thing about the Tankard to me, and there was a Jew there, an ill-looking Rascal, as ever you saw in your Life, that sells Buckles and Studds about the Streets; and if any Man had the Tankard, I must think he had it. I am a Chairman in the Winter, and in the Summer I follow labouring Work, and am a Man that's never idle. At that Time I worked with a Man in Basinghall-street , and at 6 o'Clock I came to this Mr Minton's, and having got my Supper, went to my Lodging in Red-lion-street , about 9 o'Clock. On the Tuesday following, I met a Friend in the City, who told me Mr Minton suspected I had his Tankard, because I did not use his House as usual; therefore I went thither, and called for a Pint of Beer. Mr Minton then told me, he was uneasy about his Tankard, and asked me to go with him before Colonel De Veil to be examined, with these two Men. I told him, I would go Home and put on a clean Shirt, because I did not care to appear as a Bricklayer's Labourer, and that I would come to him in half an Hour. Accordingly I went Home, and cleaned myself, and returned to Mr Minton's ; but the two Men not being come, I waited for them, and at Length we all went before Colonel De Veil. Now if I had had the Tankard, I should hardly have gone with him before the Justice ; I had Time enough to have got off. - I am hired by the Week to carry Mr Copping Williams , and in a Morning I clean his Plate to the Value of some Thousands of Pounds, and I have had more Opportunity to steal his Plate, than this poor Man's Tankard. My Prosecutor is as honest a Man as any in the World, and would not take a false Oath, - but he is set upon it. My Character was never stained before, but now it is out of my Power to get my Bread in England.</p>
               <p>Woodyere. He says he was asleep while we were in the Yard; but he did not sleep, nor appear drowsy at all; but sat as upright as I am now. I believe too that he was not in Liquor: I take it that he was but just come from Work.</p>

I was going home quietly, and thinking nothing, the Prisoner rose from the Alehouse-Door, and came up to me, and called out Kate, and swore a great Oath, that I should go and lie with her that Night ; I made answer again, and said, - Hussy , I have no Business to go Home with you; I have a Husband and Children to go Home to. With that she knock'd me down with her Fist, and took out of my Pocket what I had. I had but 18 d. in Money, a Pair of Steel Scissars, and some odd Trifles. She left me there for dead, and ran away; and I was bad enough for a Month after it. She did nothing to me, but strike me with her Fist, yet I was so sore, that I was bad a Month after it. It was Eleven o'Clock at Night, when this was done; but it was just under a Lamp, not three Yards from the Crown and Anchor Alehouse-Door. When I was a little recovered, I got up, but she was gone; so I went after her next Morning, being an ill Creature in the Place, and always robbing every Body she came nigh; for she robb'd me on the 14th of July, and on the Friday following I took her my own self, in the Fleet-Market. She was sitting in the Fleet-Market, so I went to her, and took her, and she beat me sore that Time; but I took her to an Alehouse, and a Gentleman went for a Constable to help me, and we took her before my Lord-Mayor. 'Twas on the Monday Night she robb'd me, and the next Morning I heard where she liv'd; People told me she liv'd in an ill Place, in Love's-Court. When she was before my Lord-Mayor, she confess'd that it was the other Woman (who was with her) that robbed me, and that she had then on the same Gown, which the Prisoner has on now . She said the other Woman had the Gown on, when she robbed me, that the Prisoner her self had on when I took her. When I went into Love's-Court, I went to an ill House which the Prisoner resorted to, and which is kept by one Rachael , - but I don't know her other Name, and there I saw some trifling Things of mine, - a Tea-spoon, and my Scissars, but I could not have them, because as the Prisoner had pawned them for Gin, the People refused to deliver them to me. I was advised to take my Husband and another with me, and go and demand the Things, but they having robb'd a Gentleman of 6 Guineas, and his Watch, and stripp'd him of his Cloaths, are all run away. I formerly kept a Publick-House myself, of 45 l. a Year, and knew the Prisoner by coming up and down the Market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw her in my Life: Pray ask her why she did not cry out Stop Thief.</p>
               <p>Brodier . As soon as I recovered myself, I cry'd out Stop Thief, and ran towards Holburn-Bridge , and call'd the Watch; but they were all gone to beat their Rounds.</p>

Her right Cheek Bone was bloody, and she was muddy, and dirty. I asked her what was the matter? she said she had been robbed and beat, by Betty Green . Her Knees were black and blue; and she had a Bruise upon her Head. I was not with her when she was robbed , so I can say nothing to that. But she came home in a Pucker , and in such a manner .</p>

               <p>John Lambert. On the 28th of July last, I went out to a Club Feast , and happened to get a a little in Liquor, and so I came home late. When I came to my Door, instead of going into the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030011"/> house, I sat down at the Door, and fell fast a-sleep. When I waked I found my Shoes were taken off my Feet, my Shoe-Buckles, Knee-Buckles, and my Hat were taken away too. The next Day I gave notice to the Shops, where such Things are bought, to stop them, if they came to be sold. The Shoes being a very remarkable pair of Shoes, - such a Pair, as I am sure, are not in London again, - they were brought the next day, to be sold at the next Shop, - next Door to where I live; but I don't know the Person's Name they were offered to. So I having given an Account in the Morning, that if such a remarkable Pair of Shoes should be offered to sale, they must stop them. I had notice that they were stopp'd, and I am positive they are the same which were taken off my Feet, while I was a-sleep at the Door.</p>

               <p>Robert Moone . I have seen the Prisoner, but as to the Fact , I can't say she took my Things. I was coming home the 29th, or 30th of June last, a little late, and a little in Liquor, - 'twas between 2 and 3 in the Morning, - and as I was going towards my own home, - towards Covent-Garden, a Woman took me up, and carried me to the Jersey Coffee House , in Covent-Garden; one Hyat keeps the House. There I was supply'd with something to drink; which, with what I had drank before, made me more and more in Liquor. After I had drank there, the Woman who pick'd me up, carried me to <placeName id="t17400903-12-crimeloc78">Jones's Bagnio</placeName>

The Keeper of the Bagnio came up, and told me I was at the Turk's-Head Bagnio, in Bow-Street. I informed him I was robbed of my Gold Watch, a silver Snuff-box, and silver Tooth-pick Case. I really can't say I was robbed at the Bagnio, but I will take my Oath, I had them at Hyat's House, the Jersey Coffee House ; for I pulled my Watch out there, and told the Bar-keeper, I was not capable of seeing what a clock it was myself, therefore I desired her to tell me. But missing my Things at Jones's Bagnio as soon as I wak'd, I complained that I had been robbed, but I can say nothing to the Prisoner; I met a Woman who carry'd me thither, - but I can't say it was the Prisoner; Indeed she acknowledg'd when she was before Colonel De Veil, that she was the Woman who was with me that very Morning, - at Hyat's Jersey Coffee House , first, - and then at the Turk's-Head Bagnio, but at the same time that she owned this, she denied the Fact, and said she did not rob me.</p>

            . (A. Waiter at Jones's Bagnio ) The Prisoner calls herself Ann Barton, alias Webb. She came in with the Prosecutor about the 30th of June, at the Turk's-Head Bagnio, between three and four o'Clock in the Morning. They asked for a Room; I showe'd them one; and shewing them the Room, they called for a Negus . I served them with it, and then came down Stairs, and left them. In half a Quarter of an Hour the Bell rang, as I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030012"/> thought; so I ran up Stairs, and laid hold of the Knob of the Door, but I could not open it: so I call'd to Moone, and asked him if he rang? No, G - d d - your B - d, go about your Business. Then I went down again, and carried a Bottle of Wine into the Bagnio; and about an Hour after this, I heard the Bell ring hard: upon which I ran up Stairs, and found the Door of the Room, where the Prosecutor was, open. Sir, d'ye call? says I. Where's the Woman that was with me, said he? I told him I could not tell; for he had lock'd the Door, and I could not tell what was become of her. But why do you ask, Sir? Why, (says he) she has robb'd me of my Gold Watch, a Silver Snuff-box, and a Silver Tooth-pick Case, and immediately he fell a stamping about the Room. - Hush! Hush! said I, sometimes Women go out upon necessary Occasions; and I went to the Vault to look for her, but she was not there. Then I came up Stairs again, and bid him be patient; and I hunted about the Room, and about the Bed; but I found only a few Keys, a Corkscrew, and a Bit of Sealing-wax. Why this is not my Watch, says he: No, (I told him) it was not, but he might have had 20 Watches, for ought I knew. - The Prisoner was the Woman who was with him at our Bagnio, and that's all I know of the Matter.</p>

            . A young Fellow brought me a Warrant, to serve upon the Prisoner, and desired me to go with him to the Crown-Tavern upon Ludgate-Hill . When I came there, there was Mrs Hyat and two Men; one of whom carried me to Sword and Buckler Alley , where I took the Prisoner, and brought her to the Crown-Tavern . We sat a little while, and then Mrs Hyat went and fetched her Husband ; and we set out, in Order to go before a Justice. Mr Hyat and the Prisoner talked together, and he desired she would clear him, and tell whether the Watch was lost at his House, or not. She said, the Prosecutor did not lose it there, but that she took it out of his Pocket, on the Side of the Bed, at the Turk's-Head Bagnio , and had sold the Watch, and the outside Case, at two different Times, for 6 Guineas, to one

She did deny it there, but I told the Colonel, what she had confessed to me at the Office, and as we brought her up Cheapside . For Mr Hyat had bid her confess, in an honest way, that he might get clear of the thing; upon which she fell a crying, and said, she did not know what to do. I am afraid (says she) I shall bring myself into trouble: but after she had wiped her Eyes, she said she would make a true Confession, and she accordingly confessed what I have related . <rs id="t17400903-12-verdict81" type="verdictDescription">

As soon as I had bought it, I hung it up at the Door, and so they heard of it, and came and owned it. I went this Day to see the Prisoner, and asked her if her Mother had any Share of the Money, which she took from her Master, or received from me? She only said, that she took the Money from her Master of her own accord.</p>

               <p>Thomas Murdock . On the 15th of July I was coming out of the City, and had a Bag in my Hand, with 2 lb. 12 Ounces of Human Hair, and a Comb, and a Pair of Scissars in it. I walked up towards Bloomsbury , and not being well in Health, I sat down upon a Bench, by a Door, and two Men came and sat down by me. I had not been sat down long, before I fell fast a-sleep; then a Woman, (I suppose the Prisoner is the Person) came, and took hold of me, and said, - 'wake, for your Wife has been seeking for you this Half Hour. I got up, but being drowsy, I sat down again, and did not mind her. Well, (says the Woman) if you won't 'wake, I'll take your Bag, and will carry it away. And so she did, for she took it from me, and carried it quite off. I don't know what Woman it was: I suppose it was the Prisoner.</p>

While this Gentleman (the next Witness) and I were sitting on the Bench, by the Door of the House where we lodge, the Prosecutor came up, and sat down on the Bench a little disordered, and fell asleep. He sat about a Quarter of an Hour, and then a Woman (whom I take to be the Prisoner) came and took hold of him by the Arm, and said, - Will you go Home? This she repeated two or three Times over. Then she shook him again, and he got up. Your Wife and I, says she, have been seeking you this Half-Hour. I asked her if she knew the Gentleman? Yes, yes, (said she) I lodge in the same House with him; and she shook him again; and he got up upon the Steps, but soon sat himself down again. Well then, says the Woman, if you won't go Home, I'll take care of your Bag, and your Stick, and I'll go Home and call your Wife to fetch you. And she did take the Bag and Stick out of his Hand, and went away with them; but I can't say positively the Prisoner is the Woman.</p>

            . One Morning as I was standing at my Door, about 6 in the Morning, 2 Men came to me, with a Parcel of Hair in a Silk Handkerchief, and asked me to buy it. I told them I should not buy any; then they asked me if I knew any Hair-Merchants who would buy it? I told them I did, and they wanted me to go along with them to one. I appointed them to come again at<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030014"/> 11 o'Clock, and promised to go with them then, to a Hair-Merchant. Upon this they went away, but in half an Hour they returned, and said, they could not wait so long. I then asked them, how they came by the Hair? They told me, they had it of a Hair-Merchant (who lived in the House with them) for a Debt. I could not go with them, before 11 o'Clock, and so they agreed to wait till that Time. Then I carry'd them to one Mr Peterson ; he would not buy it himself, but recommended us to Mr Abery . We went to him, and he did not seem fond of buying it. They told him the same Story, they told me; and he asked me if I knew the Men. I told him I did; and that I believed there would be no Danger. Mr Abery then asked the Men the Value of the Hair. They said, they did not know, and hop'd he would give them a Market-Price for it. He offered them 18 s. for it, which they took, and they would have given me 2 s. for my Trouble, but I would not take any thing. A little Time afterwards, I heard the Hair was advertised, and upon my saying I knew who sold it, the Prosecutor was sent to me, and I carried him to Mr Abery, who had bought it, and he told the Prosecutor he should have it again, or any Hair he had by him, which he thought would make him satisfaction. I knew nothing of the Prisoner; but the Prosecutor gave the same Account of his losing them as he has done now.</p>

I desired him to be civil, and he was angry with we; and asked me, who I was? I told him I was a Parish Officer, and Words arising between us, he pulled out his Watch, and wanted to lay me a Wager, on account of his Quarters, and calling me Scrub, he said I had not Half-a-Guinea to lay with him. This made me be so indiscreet as to pull out a Bag, in which was two 3 l. 12 s. pieces, 2 Moidores, and 2 Half-Guineas, that I might shew the Prisoner I could lay him Half-a-Guinea if I pleased. After some Words had passed, I put up my Bag; and in a very little Time afterwards the Landlord called me, and asked me, if I knew what Money I had in it? I told him I did; and upon looking it over, I found Half-a-Guinea missing. I can only say I lost it, and that the Prisoner was very much in Liquor.</p>
               <p>- Abery. I saw Half-a-Guinea lying upon the Table, where they had been disputing: and the Soldier took it up, and put it under his Watch, which lay upon the Table likewise. Then (says he) I see you have no Mind to lay a Wager, and so he put them both into his Pocket. I was sure it was one of Mr Williams's Half-guineas, for I saw it drop through his Fingers upon the Table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was very full of Liquor when I came in that Evening, and my Landlord said, he hop'd I would be in a better Humour than I was the Night before. I told him, I hop'd I was not in an ill Humour then, and that I should not be so now. He insisted upon 2 Men's lying in the Room with me. I insisted upon it, that they should not, and that began the Talk of a Wager between Mr Williams and me. He told me, if I layed a Wager of a Guinea I should lose; I said I have not a Guinea to bett, but I have what's as good as a Guinea, or two either; so I took out my Watch, and clapp'd it down on the Table, - by the same Token, I broke the main Spring of it at the same Time. I own I had the Half-Guinea, but I don't know how I came by it. They did not know that I had it, till I confessed it myself. I was so much in Liquor that Night, that though they carried me to New-Prison, I did not know where I was till next Morning.</p>
               <p>Mr Williams. He owned he had it the next Morning, but said, he did not know he had it, and he was very ready to give it me again.</p>

               <p>Mr Martin. On Thursday the 10th of July, between the Hours of 2 and 3 in the Afternoon, in going from Bonner's-Hall to Old-Ford, I was attacked in the Parish of <placeName id="t17400903-16-crimeloc103">Stepney</placeName>

I am sure the Prisoner is the Man: He was on Foot, and crossing the Way suddenly, he catch'd hold of the Horse's Reins, and presenting a Pistol, he demanded my Money. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030015"/> drove the Horse myself, and being alone, I was somewhat startled at such an unexpected Visit, at that Time of the Day; and I had some Things of Value about me, which I forgot in a Hurry of Business to leave behind me. However, observing some People at a Distance, at Work in a Pea-field, and imagining he had not seen them, (for I believe they were about 40 or 50 Yards off,) I thought proper to acquaint him with it, in Hopes of deterring him from prosecuting his Design, or else that I might watch an Opportunity to jump out of the Chaise, and defend myself. So I stood up in the Chaise, and asked him how he could be so impudent as to rob me, in sight of so many People? And I held out my Hand at the same Time, hoping they would come to my Assistance; but being disappointed of that, as he kept his Pistol at my Head, and as my Life was at his Mercy, I thought the safest Way was to sit down, and in some Measure to comply with his Demand. Therefore putting my Hand into my Pocket, I pull'd out some Money and gave him, which I afterwards found, a Halfcrown and a Halfpenny: for my Glove being on, I could not get my Hand to the Bottom of my Pocket, and I did not care to pull it off, lest I should discover a Mourning-Ring of more Value. But instead of asking me for more Money, he immediately demanded my Watch, which I had been so careful of concealing, that I imagined he had not seen it; for I had tuck'd the Chain into my Pocket, and endeavoured to hide it: therefore, not imagining he had seen it, I deny'd that I had one. He still insisted upon it that I had one, and upon my finding that I could not escape without being plundered, I resolved to attempt jumping out of the Chaise; but before I could compleat my Design, he left the Horse's Head where he stood, and crouching under the Horse's Head, he advanced nearer to me, and altered the Position of his Hand as he advanced: and at last (with the utmost Cruelty) he snapp'd his Pistol at me. It happened, that it only flashed in the Pan; and when I saw that, I jump'd out of the Chaise immediately, on the same Side the Prisoner stood. He ran away; I ran after him with my Whip in my Hand; and when I had pursued him about 30 Yards, he turned and presented his Pistol at me, with the same Menaces as before. I was not certain what Number of Pistols he might have about him, so seeing a Brickbat, I stooped down and catched it up to defend myself; and as he stood, I flung it at him, and very narrowly missed him. Upon this, he immediately turned Tail again, and I made after him. Now I was satisfy'd he had no more Pistols about him; so I kept shouting out, - Now I have you! - You have no more Pistols! He, upon this, made up to a Field, and I briskly made up to him, and finding he began to give out, I struck him with the But-end of my Whip, on the hind-part of his Head, and repeated my Blows, which made him turn about again upon me. But some how or other I lam'd his Right-hand with a Blow; and then I flew at him, and wrenched the Pistol out of his Hand, upon which he immediately cried out - he would surrender. This is the Pistol I took from him; the Bullet is in it, - but the Flint is taken out, and the Touch-hole is plugg'd up. By this Time a Person on Horseback, who was in the Field where I saw other Men at Work, came up to me, and he went with me to Bethnal-Green ; but being informed the Gentlemen in the Commission were gone to Hackney, we carry'd the Prisoner before Mr Justice Selman, at Old-Ford, who was so kind as to take his Examination and Confession, which is now in Court.</p>

A Silver Salt, worth about 10 s. and a Pair of Silver Tea-tongs, worth 4 s. at least, for they cost me 18. They were all mine; I saw them that Tuesday Morning, but did not miss them till the Thursday following. Now I recollect my self, I remember I saw them when I was going to Dinner on Tuesday , and we have never seen them since The Prisoner came to my House under pretence of taking it ready furnished for the Swedish Ambassador. He was twice at the House on the Monday before for this Purpose; and he came again on Tuesday, and brought a Letter with him sealed up, pretending it came from the Envoy of Sweden's Lady , and that it contained an Agreement for the House at four Guineas a Week; that she was so well pleased with the Description he had given of the House, that she would be content to pay that Money for it. I saw the Prisoner deliver the Letter to my Wife, - but I don't understand French, though she does.</p>

               <p>Mr Crawford. I can't say I saw the Prisoner take the Plate, for I was not at home when he came the last time, and when we suppose he took it. But missing it, we advertised it, with a Description of the Prisoner ; and on Saturday Morning about 11, Mr Benn, who keeps a Shop under St Dunstan's Church , in Fleet-Street, came to me, and informed me, that he believed from the Description I had put in the Daily-Advertiser, That the Person who had robbed me, had brought a Silver Spoon to sell at Mr Deard's Shop; but Mr Deard's

             being ill, he sent him to Mr Wild's Shop, and offered it there, with Medals and French Coin. Mr Wild not being in the Shop, his Wife she sent for Mr Benn , the Watch-maker, at next Door, and while they were looking at the Things, Mr Wild himself came in, and observing a Crest upon the Spoon, he stopped both That, and the Prisoner. They suspected it to be the Lord Darby's Crest, and while they went with the Prisoner to Lord Darby, Mr Benn came to me, and upon the Information he gave me, I went with him, and overtook the Prisoner in Burlington-Gardens. As soon as I saw the Prisoner, I said, - By G - , that's the Fellow: upon which he turned about, and took to his Heels; I ran after him as far as May-Fair , and there he was taken: but I found nothing upon him, nor did he confess any thing to me; only he down'd on his Knees and begged Pardon; but 'twas in French, and I did not understand it. I charged him with taking my Plate, because there had been nobody in the Room from the Time I saw it, to the Time of my missing it; but He, my Wife, and my own Family.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Do you know me?</p>
               <p>Mr Crawford. As well as I know my own Right-Hand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave it to the Judgment of the Court.</p>
               <p>Mrs Crawford. I was out of Town on Monday, but a Gentlewoman who lives with me dispatched a Messenger to let me know, that a Person had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030017"/> there about taking our House, and that I must be at home about 12 o'clock, for he was then to come again and bring the Person with him, who was to have the House. I was very well pleased, and I am sure I was not 3 Quarters of an Hour in walking from Chelsea to Queen-Street. I got home a little past 12, and finding the Gentleman had not been there, I said, I hoped I should not loose my Labour, I waited (very impatient for his coming) till between 1 and 2, and nobody came. At last, as I sat in my Fore-parlour, I saw the Prisoner coming along, in a dark Suit of Cloaths, Silk Breeches, and a little dirty short Wig. O says I, to the Gentlewoman who was with me, - there's a Foreigner! He presently knocked at the door, and came in and said, - Madam, you give me Account of the House, and the Price. I desired him to walk in, and shew me what he wanted. He did so, and desired my Name, and Directions to the House, for the Secretary belonging to the Envoy. I called to my Husband, and desired him to set down our Name, and how many Doors up the Street our House was, that he might carry these Particulars with him. He said the Envoy was hurried out of Town, with the French Ambassador, and I took it for granted, that as soon as he returned, I should have advice of it; so he went away telling me, This Envoy was recommended to us, by a Person of my Acquaintance. I said, I wonder'd who it should be: He told me, I should know when the Envoy came, and so we parted. But on Tuesday about 11 or 12, he came again; My Husband was at home, and I was in the Fore-Parlour. As soon as he came in, he gave me this Letter; I opened it, and desired the Prisoner to read it, for, says I, I don't know whether I could read it, or no. He said, he wonder'd I could not read it, when I spoke so good French; so he took it, and says he, - Women don't understand Orthograph, (Orthography) and he read the Letter very perfect. I was transported to think I should have a Foreign Minister for four Years in my House, and said to my Husband, - My Dear, we are very lucky to let our House to such a Person. Aye says he, 'tis very well, if they pay us. O, says I, Publick Ministers never do otherwise; and then speaking to the Prisoner, - Sir, says I, by the Contents of the Letter, you are to lie here to-night. Yes, Madam, says he. There, (says I to my Husband,) there's satisfaction enough, and therefore take down the Bill. I asked the Prisoner to stay and dine with us upon a Shoulder of Mutton: He said no, and went away; and I was in Raptures, and was wished Joy, on this Account. About 5 o'clock, as I was ironing some little Things in my Kitchen, somebody knocked at the Door. A Gentlewoman, looked out of the Area, and said, - there was Monsieur come again. As soon as he came in, he went up Stairs, and the Gentlewoman went up with him? I called to her, and bid her desire him to come down; for when he went away the Time before, he said, he would go and fetch the Baggage, and would come and lie there; so I thought he was no better than a Valet de Chambre. Upon her desiring him to come down, he did so in an instant, and said to me, - Madam, the reason of my coming is, that I find you have a House in the Country, and perhaps it may not suit with your Conveniency, to let me lie here to-night. I told him, I always had somebody or other in the House, and it would be no Inconveniency to me at all: Nay, in case His Excellency himself had a mind to come to-night, it would not put me to a Nonplus; - for I was to have found Linnen, Plate, China, - Plate, he said the Baron had of his own; and as to the rest of the Things, as soon as ever the Baron came to be settled, he would buy them all himself. Thus he stood chatting, while I was ironing : and my Son, (who lives with an Attorney, having 2 or 3 Hours to spare,) happened to come in, and upon his seeing the Letter lie upon the Table, I told him how lucky we had been, and desired him to read it. Is that your Son, says the Prisoner? And can he read the Letter? Yes, Sir, says I, but not so well as you, for he does not fancy his French, though he has been at Paris. Among other Things, I asked him what Religion the Ambassador was of? He said, He had changed his Religion, and was now a Protestant; that he was about Forty Years old, and that his Lady was a very agreeable Woman. I told him I had a House in the Country, and should be very glad, if she would come and take an airing with me. After this, he asked me, if I had ever a French Book? I told him I had, but Mr Crawford had locked most of them up, however (as we were all busy, it being Execution-Day) I said to him, if he would go into such a Back-closet, he would find some. He had before seen the House, all over, so he goes up, and came down again presently with a Book in his Hand; - O Madam, says he, here is very good Book; it treat about the Romans. Sir, says I, if it is worth your Acceptance, 'tis at your Service; and I intended to offer him a Pair of Gloves when my Lodgers came, but he whipp'd up Stairs again, and came down and ask'd for a little Water. Jenny, says I, (to the Maid) your Master will want a little Punch at Night, go and get a little Pump-Water, and give the Gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030018"/> some. He said no, He would no give the Trouble; but I bid her go. After this, says he, - Madam I will go up, and sit in the Closet by the Garden. O Sir, says I, the Garden is a very poor Place; you had better sit in the Fore-Parlour * - that will divert you. Accordingly he went there, and staid a little Time; Then he came down again into the Kitchen, and asked what o'clock it was. I told him, I had sent my Clock into the Country, and my Watch did not go. My Son told him 'twas almost 6 o'clock; then he said he would go to a House, where there was a Half-crown and a Twelve-penny Ordinary, the Sign of the King's-Arms, (he thought) but he did not know the name of the Street; but he would return that Night; - he would not keep us up late, - and he desired to take the Book with him. At half an Hour after 10, I went to Bed, and left my Husband up, playing at Picquet with a Gentlewoman; when he came to Bed he told me, my Lodger was not come; nor did he ever come afterwards. The Things mentioned in the Indictment were safe that Day about 2 o'clock, and were in a Place in the Fore-Parlour, which Place was locked, but the Key was left in the Door. I have never seen any of them since, nor have I any Prospect of ever seeing them again. That same Night, after the Prisoner was gone, I locked up the Place from whence the Plate was taken, and seeing other Things stand in Front, as they had done, I had no manner of Mistrust that any thing was gone; and to my Knowledge 'twas never unlocked again, till the Thursday, when we missed them; and then my Husband he went to enquire after the

            . I am Wife of Morgan Mityard; he does not live with me, nor has he been with me these three Years. We are parted; but it is only by our own Consent: no Act of Separation, nor any Divorce has passed between us. I live with Mr Hayes and Mr. Graham, Apothecaries, in Conduit-street , near Hanover-square ; and on the 25th of August, I lost out of my Master's Kitchen a cambrick Handkerchief, worth 6 s. and these two Rings which I have upon my Finger; one has a Cornelian Stone with three small ones on each Side, the other hath a Bristol-stone, with three little ones in the same Manner. I value them at 10 s. a-piece. The Prisoner came to my Master's House, to take Lodgings for an Ambassador's Secretary. I asked him the Ambassador's Name, but he told me, I could not understand him. I missed the Things in a Quarter of an Hour after he was gone, and I am sure he is the Man. He was but once at our House, and that was on Monday the 25th of August, and he was taken the Saturday following, near Dover-street. I was not present when he was taken, but I was with him at the Alehouse, before he was carried to Sir Edward Hill. I had the Rings from

I lost on the 17th of August last, all the Things mentioned in the Indictment out of my Dining-Room, up one Pair of Stairs. I saw them in the Room on Saturday Night; they were all stole at once, on the Sabbath-day, but I did not miss them till Monday. The 4 Gowns were worth about 40 s. or 3 l. the Ring 7 s. the Tea-spoon 1 s. or 2, and-the three Petticoats were worth about 4 s. I would not over-rate them. I did not suspect the Prisoner (Fisher) till she was taken up and put in Newgate . Then I went to her, and she confessed she took all the Things, and that Holden and his Wife received them. I did not know her, for I never saw her in my Life, before that Time; but upon my asking her if she knew any Thing of the Goods I had lost, she told me, that Mrs Holden shewed her our Back-door, and told her, if she could get up Stairs, she would find something of Value. That she accordingly went up, and put the Things into her Apron, while Mrs Holden waited for her at the End of Whitecross-street, and when the Prisoner came to her with the Things, she (Holden) took them from her, and carry'd them to her Room. All the Gowns and Petticoats I had again; I found them at the Places Fisher directed me to. The strip'd silk Gown I found in Holden's House; two others in Chick-Lane, at one Fountaine's , who sells old Cloaths. The other I found at Pinchbeck's , in Field-Lane . One Petticoat was sold to a Woman in the Rope-walk , who let me have it again; another to one Howard, in Golden-Lane; and the third Petticoat I found at Holden's House, between the Bed and the Sacking, where he and his Wife lay; I found the Silk Gown and the Petticoat in their House, with a Sheet and a Table-cloth, which are not in the Indictment. And these Things I found in the Presence of Holden and his Wife. The Tea-spoon I found at one Stevenson's, (who goes by the Name of Penn) in Golden-Lane; and the Ring was sold at a Silversmith's in Newgate-street , but she (Fisher) could not tell which was the Shop.</p>
               <p>Rebecca Holden. I ask him where he found the Gown?</p>
               <p>Walsham. The Gown hung up in a Sort of a Press: it was not concealed, but the Petticoat was hid, between the Bottom of the Bed and the Sacking.</p>
               <p>Holden. Did I refuse to let you search?</p>
               <p>Walsham. They could not; I had a Search-Warrant.</p>

             confirmed Mr Walsham's Account, of the Prisoner Fisher's Confession, and of the finding the Goods in the Manner he related. He added, that when the Holdens were before Mr Justice Wroth, they said, they bought the Gown, which was found in their Room, of the Prisoner Fisher, for a Crown; and the Petticoat (found under the Bed) she left there, to be made less in the Waist; and that they took her (when she brought these Things to them) to be a Dealer in Rag-Fair .</p>
               <p>Mrs De La Fountaine. I bought 2 Gowns of an elderly Woman and a Girl, last Monday was a Fort night; the Girl at the Bar brought them, and the Woman (Holden) was with her. I gave 8 s. for one, and 4 for the other. The Constable has got them, but he is not here.</p>
               <p>Mr Walsham. I saw them hang up at this Witness's Door, and I swear they are mine.</p>
               <p>De La Fountaine . I tender'd the Money for one of them to the Old Woman; and I think the Girl (Fisher) took the Money for the other. I asked Holden how she came by the Things? She said, she was under Misfortunes, and that she was sorry to part with her Cloaths ; but she must part with them, she said, to pay her Debts. Holden had a Child in her Arms, as she has now; and Fisher told me the Child was her Brother, and that Holden was her Mother; and upon their Complaints, I gave them 2 Shillings more for one of the Gowns, than it was worth. I have never seen either of them since, nor have I had any Discourse with them.</p>
               <p>Rebecca Holden. Did I come into the Shop, before you had bargained with the Girl, and had sent out for Change.</p>
               <p>De La Fountaine . She came in, while the Change was sent for: Fisher, the Girl, came in and bargained for the Things? Holden was at the Door, and upon her telling me 'twas her Mother, I bid her come in, and the 8 s. for one of the Gowns, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030020"/> tender'd down to her in Shillings, all in a Row; and she took them up.</p>

            . The young Prisoner (Fisher) brought me a strip'd Holland Gown, and the old Woman was her. I bid her 7 s. for it, but she went away, and would not take it. In an Hour's Time they came back, and would take the Money. Fisher said it was her own Gown, and I told her she was a nasty Slut to wear such a Gown, and draggle it so. She told me, she could not help it; she bought it, and it was too long for her, and now she was obliged to sell it, because her Husband was in Woodstreet-Counter .

            . I saw the Gown and Petticoat taken out of Holden's Room, as hath been related. Rebecca Holden said, that Fisher lodged in the House, but not in that Room where the Things were found: she own'd Fisher brought them in, but thought (as she said) that she had brought them from her Washerwoman's.</p>
               <p>Fisher the Girl. I lodg'd in these People's House; she said to me that Sunday Morning, - Betty, you owe me a small Matter of Money, I will give you a Dram or 2, and will shew you where you may get something. So she carried me to Mr. Walsham's Back-door, and I went up, and took the Things; she waited for me, and took them out of my Apron into her own, and went with me to sell 'em.</p>

            . I live in Holden's House, - up one pair of stairs. Mrs. Holden was up in my Room that Morning, and her Husband was in the Garden. The Girl came in and called her down stairs, and said she had fetched some Things from her Washerwoman's. I came down stairs, and saw a new Cotton Gown, and said, - This Gown never came from the Washerwoman's. She said it did, and borrowed a Shilling of Holden to pay for her washing.</p>
               <p>Rebecca Holden. Did not she say she would hang 20 People, before she would hang me, - I mean before she would hang herself.</p>
               <p>Brown. When the Constable came into the House, she said so. She goes by the Name of Fisher, but her right Name is Ballenger.</p>

In Term-time, I have Part of the Plate in my Custody; 'tis delivered to me by Mr Brounker, the Treasurer, and I give him a Receipt for such Plate as he delivers into my Custody; I likewise give a Bond of Security to the Society in general, for the faithful Execution of my Office; and from time to time that 'tis delivered to me, till I return it back to Mr Brounker, no one has any Authority to take it away. When I bring it for Use, into the Hall, as soon as 'tis done with, I take it back again into my Custody, and have the sole Charge of it, and keep it in a Place appointed for that purpose, and which is under my Care. On the 24th of June last, which was in Trinity-Term , it was our Grand Day; and this is the Plate which I lost that Day out of the Middle-Temple-Hall , about 5 o'clock in the Afternoon. This Salver is the Fellow to what we then lost; - we have 4 of them in all. There's the Temple Arms upon it, and I can swear 'tis what I lost. I missed it about 5 o'clock, and had it in my Hand, about half an Hour before. I had it (with other Plate) in my Custody, from the Beginning of Easter-Term to that Time, and did not deliver it back for the short Vacation, between Easter and Trinity, so I kept it for the two Terms. This Receipt I signed for the Plate at the Time it bears date. It was read. '' April 21, 1740. Received all the Plate from Mr Brounker into my Custody, as mentioned Page 39 of this Book.'' I saw Page 39 several times, before I signed the Receipt, and this Piece of Plate among others is there mentioned, - 4 Salvers, with the Arms marked p T B. Those Letters stood for the Name of the Treasurer: Mr Broderick was Treasurer when this Plate was made. Some Time after it was lost, I heard by an Advertisement, that one Mr Urton, a Pawnbroker, had stopped a Piece of Plate; I went to him, and found 2 Pieces in his Custody, (which belonged to the Feet of the Salver) the whole Bottom I found in the Prisoner's Lodgings, up 2 pair of stairs, in Windmill street, where he was taken. He told me himself that he lodged there. We found the Door locked, and upon entring the Room and searching it, we discovered the Plate upon a Shelf over the Door; it had been burnt in the Fire and bent back, almost quite double. The Pieces which we found at Mr Urton's belong to it.</p>
               <p>Couns. What do you take the Plate to be worth?</p>
               <p>Mr Riley. There is the Weight engraved on the Back of it, 42 Ounces 7 Penny-weights, therefore it must be worth above 10 l. I was with the Prisoner before the Justice, who took his Confession in Writing.</p>
               <p>Sir Edward Hill. I read his Confession to him, and he sign'd it in my Presence. The Confession was taken by me, and acknowledged before me, the 14th Day of July, 1740.</p>

            . The Prisoner brought only these Pieces of the Feet to me, on the 5th of July, - the Saturday before I advertised them in the Papers. He wanted to pledge them; I taxed him hard, and he said they were his own; but would not tell any Thing farther, for he told me that wa s enough. I had taken some of them 3 Days before; these two Pieces with the Holes in them, I took the Thursday before; for I knew the Prisoner, - I had known him 8 or 10 Years, but always very poor; so I took these Pieces, and he told me, he had brought them from a Working Silversmith. But when he came with these small Bits on the Saturday following, I stopped him. I was present when the Prisoner's Room was searched, and found the Bottom of the Salver upon the Shelf over the Door, in his Room. I take these Pieces to belong to it.</p>
               <p>The Counsel for the King to prove the Indictment properly laid, took notice, that as the Case stood, it was the best way, to lay the Goods as the Property of Mr Riley, who was Chief Butler of the Middle-Temple, and says the Plate is delivered into his Charge, and that he is answerable for it: that therefore he has a temporary Possession, and consequently a good Property. That this Case might be compared to that of a Carrier, to whose Care Goods are committed, which Goods are said to be the Carrier's pro Tempore, because he has them for a Time, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030023"/> bring them to the Place designed. That this was a similar Case; Mr Riley having, pro Tempore, the same Possession, as appeared from his Evidence. That in the Case of a Taylor, - If Cloth be delivered to a Taylor, and a Felon steal it, and an Indictment against him be fram'd, the Cloth may be said to be the Property of the Taylor. That in Pulton, de Pace, Fol. 70. Sect. 18. The Words are, If a Man deliver Cloth to a Taylor, and a Felon steal it, the Felon may be indicted for stealing the Goods of the Taylor. It was further urged, that if Goods are delivered to a Bailiff, and he is liable to return them, or is answerable for them, if the Person who owns them, or has the Property in them, comes privately, and takes them away, without the Knowledge of the Bailiff, it is Felony. Vid. Coke's Institutes, Folio 110. It was therefore hop'd, that this was a proper Indictment, because Mr Riley had a special Property in the Goods, and a just Possession.</p>

[The Titles of the Books were read, with Those set forth in the Indictment, and the Witness gave much the same Account of their Value.] A Watchman found the Shop broke open, and sent to my Dwelling-house to inform me of it, between two and three in the Morning. The Prisoner Wilson was taken in the Shop. He gave an Account that Murray, the other Prisoner, had the Books, and they were found in a Chamber of Mr Ward's, at No. 9, in Furnival's-Inn. Several of them were delivered me by Mr Ward's eldest Clerk, and these four were taken out of Murray's Pocket; I saw them taken out: he shewed them to me himself, and put them into the Beadle's Hands. The Guardians were found in a Closet in Mr Ward's Chambers; Murray directed a Person to look for the Key of the Closet, and confessed that it was all along of Wilson. Wilson had confessed before I took Murray, that Murray and he broke open the Shop, and took out the Books. This he confessed to me, and likewise before my Lord-Mayor: He confessed he was in the Shop, and delivered out the Books to Murray; so in the Evening we went to Murray, and found these Books upon him. Murray did not deny the Fact at first, but blamed Wilson, and Wilson blamed him; but when Murray was before my Lord-Mayor he denied it, and said Wilson threw them all in (unknown to him) at a Window at Mr Ward's Chambers.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. Did I make any Confession in writing?</p>
               <p>Mr Jones. He went back to my Lord-Mayor's, and had an Information wrote, to charge Murray; and told me, I should have every Book again: I saw the Information, but I know nothing of his signing it.</p>
               <p>Murray. Is not this a large Shop of Books, from whence these were taken?</p>
               <p>Mr Jones. No, it is a little Shop; there is about 2 or 3 hundred Books in it; all mark'd with my Mark. These have my Mark in them, - an Alphabet Letter, - F, or M, or N. They are put in my Books, both to distinguish the Prices, and ascertain my Property; and they are such Marks as are peculiar to myself.</p>
               <p>Murray. Have you no more of those Sort of Books in that Shop?</p>
               <p>Mr Jones. I have no more Guardians but this Set, at that Place: I believe I had no more of any of these Sorts there. I am sure these are all my Books. I know them.</p>
               <p>Murray. What Mark was in the Guardians?</p>
               <p>Jones. An Z and F. And there is an M in the Rights of Princes.</p>
               <p>Murray. When did you first hear of me?</p>
               <p>Jones. Wilson gave me Information that he was concerned in the Robbery, and I took him at his Master's Chambers. I can't tell whether he is a regular Clerk to Mr Ward or not; the eldest Clerk when I was there, told me Mr Ward was out of Town.</p>

            , (a Watchman). Three Minutes before two in the Morning, the 19th of July, I went to the upper End of my Walk, that I might beat down again, when the Clock struck. When I was got just against this Shop, I heard a Clatter, - a falling down of something. I immediately went up, and knocked at the Shop door - Who is there, says I? There was no Answer, - so I called out again, - Who is there? A Man (who we found afterwards was Wilson) answer'd, - It was his Brother's Stall, and he came there to lie that Night. I bid him open the Door; he would not, but kept it fast with his Lift Garter. I saw the Staple of the Padlock bent, and hanging upon the Door, so I thought it did not look well; and a Brother-Watchman coming up to assist me, we forced the Door open, and laid hold of him. We did not find any Thing upon him, but the Books were pulled down, and lay ready upon the Stand to be carried off. When we took him, (Wilson) he said but little, only he desired us to use him as a Gentleman, for - he was no Scoundrel. But my Partner took him to the Watch-house, and I said to look after the Shop, so I heard him make no Confession.</p>
               <p>Murray. When you saw Wilson in the Shop, did you see any Body else about the Door?</p>
               <p>Robinson. I saw nobody at all about the Door, after I heard the Noise.</p>
               <p>Aspley. I am the Watchman that Robinson called to his Assistance. As he went up to beat his Rounds, he lifted up his Lanthorn to the Door. I called and asked what was the Matter? Here is somebody in the Shop, says he! I ran over to him, and heard Wilson say, it was his Brother's Shop, and he came there to sleep, and would sleep. I observed the Bar to be down, and that the Padlock hung upon the Staple; so I whispered

            , and told him, I would call another Watchman to take Care of him. When I was going to call another Man, then he was for coming out of the Shop; - No, no, says I, as you have staid all this while, stay a little longer; and when I had got another Watchman, we opened the Door, and told him, he must go to the Watch-house. He called us a Parcel of Scoundrels , and said he would go to his Brother's at Furuival's-Inn. I told him he should go to the Watch-house, and as we carried him along he catch'd hold of the Bar of a Window, and held so fast, that I was forced to give him a Knock on the Elbow to make him let go. Then we carried him to the Watch-house, and sent for Mr Jones, but we found nothing upon him. I was with him before my Lord-Mayor, where he would own nothing at all at first, but at last, he said Murray was concerned with him, in breaking open the Shop, and taking the Books. By his Information Murray was taken, and brought to us, who waited for him at Furnival's-Inn-Cellar ; and there he (Murray) delivered 4 Books out of his Pocket; (what they were I can't tell) and he said the rest were in a particular Place, and told us where the Key lay, which was to open the Door of the Closet in his Master's Chambers, where the Books were put. I heard Murray tell Mr Jones he should not lose one of his Books; and that it was all along of Wilson that he came into the Scrape. These two Carpenter's Tools I found standing upright against the Wall, within 2 or 3 Doors of the Shop which had been broke open, about an Hour after Wilson was taken.</p>

            . I was Constable that Night, when the Watchmen brought Wilson, by Force, into the Watch-house. They told me he had broke open a Bookseller's Shop joining to Staple's-Inn . He would not confess any thing at first; but when he found I was going to send him to the Compter , he said, Mr Jones should have all his Books again. I sent him to the Compter that Night, and next Morning, carried him before my Lord-Mayor, where he denied having the Books; but after my Lord had committed him to the Compter, he acknowledged that he took them out of the Shop, and delivered them to Murray, and said that Mur- ray took them away in 2 Pillow-cases. Wilson directed me where to find Murray, and accordingly I found him at Mr Ward's Chambers, No. 9. in Furnival's-Inn. When I first went to the Chambers, he was not within; but Mr Dowdell told me, he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030025"/> expected him in every Minute, so I went to Furnival's-Inn-Cellar , and sat a-while; then I desired Mr Jones and his Son to go and see for him; and they brought him down to us. I asked him, What he had done with the Books? He pretended not to know what I meant. You do, says I, - your Companion has impeached, and has told us where the Books are. Upon this he sat down a little while, and then says he, - He's a vile Rogue, he has drawn me into this Scrape; but if Mr Jones will be easy, he shall not lose one of them. He did not own he took them, but said they were thrown in at the Window.</p>

No; get away, or I'll lay my Stick over your Back. No; you won't, says she, and immediately she clapped hold of the Chain of my Watch, drew it out, and ran away with it, as soon as she had got it. I felt it go at once. I pursued her about 20 Yards, or somewhat less, and caught hold of her; which I had no sooner done, but 3 Fellows came from the other Side of the Way, and one of them struck me on the Forehead, with so much Violence, that it immediately swelled up as big as my Fist. They knock'd me down, and beat my Hatt off. As soon as I was recovered, I saw her running off, so I pushed from the Men, and got hold of her again, and called out for the Watch, as hard as I could call. I resolved I would not loose my hold, nor let her go, but the Fellows came up again to me, and swore d - n my Bl - d they would beat my Brains out, if I did not let her go. However, I held her till the Watch came up to my Assistance; for in her running from me. She happened to run nearer the Watch-house: and I held her till I got her there. As soon as I had got to the Watch-house, one of the Men, who used me ill in the Street, cry'd out, d - n him, he has lost no Watch, search him. Aye, says the Pri- soner, search him, and I will be searched too. Up- on this, I felt down my Pockets, and found my Watch in my Left-hand Coat-pocket. Then one of the Men, who was on the outside of the Door, clapp'd himself between the 2 Doors of the Watch-house, and swore she should not stay there, for there was no Constable, (he said) and she should not be stopped there. I bid the Watchmen take Care of the Door, and then the Constable was sent for. The Watch was found before the Constable came.</p>

D - n you, says one of the Men, you're a Fool, you don't know what you've lost; you have lost nothing, and you shan't hold the Woman: So they all cross'd the Way, and went about 5 or 6 Yards farther; and then they rescued the Prisoner from the Prosecutor; cursing him at the same Time, and telling him, if he did not let the Woman go, they would knock his Brains out. Marr said this, and he had a Poker in his Hand, about 2 Foot long at the same Time. Webb said the same, and that if the Prosecutor would not let the Prisoner go, he would lick him. So they rescued her from him, and she ran away about 20 Yards, but he followed, and caught her, and pushed her into the Watch-house. The Constable not being there, they swore she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030026"/> should not stay there; for they said, he had no Authority to keep her; and Marr, with the Poker, opened the Half-door, and put the Poker in, to get it open. I saw the Prosecutor had had a Blow; he had a Lump upon his Head, near as big as a Goose-Egg, but I can't tell who gave it him. I went into the Watch-house with him; and was there when the Constable came: The Prosecutor charged her, before him, with taking his Watch. When I first came up to him in the Street, he was feeling for his Watch with one Hand, and held the Prisoner with the other; and after he had felt about him, he said he had lost his Watch. The Constable came in 10 Minutes after he got her into the Watch-house, and he said, he had lost his Hat, but he did not charge her with that, only with his Watch. I don't remember what the People said in the Watch-house; but when he came in there, his Coat Pocket stood open, and in a little Time, he found it in that Pocket. I believe they might slip the Watch into it. Neither of the Men who took the Woman's Part were then in the Watch-house; only an old Man they call the Governour of the Watch-house, the Prisoner and the Prosecutor were there at that Time: I was close to the Door, but afterwards I went in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was not the Prosecutor in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Mackarel. I never saw the Prosecutor before that Time, in my Life. Upon my Oath I don't know that he was fuddled; he had been drinking he said, but I did not observe that he was fuddled. The Blow perhaps might disorder him a little just then, but in a Quarter of an Hour afterward, he was as well as any Man in the World.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Was he not willing to make it up, if I would give him Five Shillings for the Loss of his Hat?</p>
               <p>Mackarel. There was one of the Men threaten'd to go to Law with him, and the Man seemed not to know what to do. I did not hear him offer to make it up, but I heard them offer him Money for that purpose, and he did not say he would take it. As to his Hat I never saw it at all; it was gone before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How did the Prosecutor at that Time say he was attacked?</p>
               <p>Mackarel. He said he came from the Cock-Inn, in Aldersgate-street, and gave exactly the same Account of the Thing, as he has done now.</p>

            . Between 10 and 11 I was standing at my own Door, just by Kingsgate-street , in Holborn, and hearing an Outcry , and a Noise, I went to see what was the Matter. And about 2 or 300 Yards from my Door, I observed 2 or 3 Men with a Woman, who was striving to get away. One Man insisted upon keeping her, and would not let her go; but 3 Men endeavoured to get her off. He that held her, said she had robbed him of his Hat and his Watch. I stood a little while, and saw a lusty Man, pretty well dressed, who said she should go, - this was at the End of Kingsgate-street , and as she was going to the Watch-house, he said, she should go away, for there was no proper Officer to detain her there. The Man that held her in Custody, said, he was an Officer himself. The other Men said he had no Power to take her, or detain her, because the Cause was his own. I made answer, and said, - every Man is an Officer to detect a Thief; upon which they were silent a little, and the Woman immediately ran away from him. I imagine the Man was held while she elop'd, but he followed her sharply, and caught her again. Then I went home to my own House; but hearing a Tumult again, I ran cross the Way, and found the Men were holding him who would have kept the Woman, and she ran away from him the second Time. But some of the People saying if she was a Thief, she ought to be brought to Justice, she was at last got to the Watch-house. What passed there I know not, for I then went home again. I never saw the Prisoner before that Night, but I am pretty sure she is the same Person. I have no Doubt but she is the same. The Man, I am positive, said, he had lost his Hat and his Watch; but he charged her with taking his Watch only.</p>

            . - I don't know the Prisoner, if I was to see her; so I have no Occasion to look at her. All I have to say is, that on Thursday Se'ennight, in the Evening, I was in Company with Samuel Ellington, at the Cock-Inn in Aldersgate-street. I parted with him at the Gate about 10 o'clock, and he was very capable of going Home; - I know he was very sober.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I happened to be at Mr Harris's House in Holborn, till 10 at Night, and was going Home. The Prosecutor came up to me in the Street, and insisted upon my going with him. I refused; he seemed drunk, and said he was an Officer. I told him I was a very honest Woman, and never went with a Man in my Life; but he took hold of my Handkerchief, and began to be rude; upon which I cry'd out, and some Gentlemen came up, and asked him what he wanted with me, and if he had lost any Thing? First, he said he had lost his Handkerchief, afterwards he had lost his Watch, and the Minute he came into the Watch-house, he pulled it out of his Pocket. Then the Gentlemen called him Rogue, and asked him how he could serve the Poor Woman so, when he had got his Watch? He said he had nothing to alledge against me, but he had lost his Hat among the Mob, and I should give him a Crown, for it cost him 10 Shillings. A Man afterwards came into the Watch-house, and persuaded him to swear for the Sake of the Reward *.</p>

            . I remember the Prosecutor. This Day Fortnight in the Evening, I saw him at the End of Kingsgate-street a little after 10. He had got that Woman there, - I believe, - I never saw her before, - till Yesterday, - I believe it to be that Woman. - It was very Moonlight; - He had her by the Handkerchief, and 3 or 4 People were with her. I believe there were 3 Men with her, - I will take upon me to say there were 3 Men with her: and I coming along, asked what was the Matter, seeing a Man hold a Woman by the Throat, and the Prosecutor was drunk at the same Time. He said the Woman had robbed him, and had robbed him of his Hat. There were 2 or 3 Gentlemen more with me, and I said, Gentlemen, Which Way possible could the Woman rob the Man of his Hat? I asked him, Which Way he lost his Hat? With a good deal of Discourse, he signified, that he intended to be very free with her; then I concluded, that his attempting to be rude with her, might occasion his Hat to be dropped. I said, Why don't you loose the Woman and look for your Hat? He said, D - n her, he was a Constable of St Giles's, and would not loose her; but drew her over the Way to a Soap-Boiler's Shop, and there by the Perswasion of the People, and of me among the rest, - we persuaded him to let her go, that she might go to the Round-House. Accordingly we went, to go to the Round-House, and the Woman ran away from him, just above Queen-street. When he was got on the other Side Queen-street, the Woman was gone a little Way before. Then he said, d - n her, he had lost his Watch, and immediately he ran after her, and catch'd her by both her Hands, and pull'd her into the Round-House. There was an Old Man, who they call the Round-house-keeper, he let them in. She told him, she had not his Watch; I will be searched, says she, - or search me, - one or the other. Accordingly she goes to search her self, and in searching herself, she said, let somebody search him, and see if his Watch is not about him. Then he searched himself, and I believe it was out of his Left-hand Coat or Waistcoat Pocket, - I can't tell which, - he pull'd out his Watch. After this, I wanted to get into the Round-house, but the Old Man who keeps it would not let me come in, but sent away for a Constable. The Constable I happened to know, and so I was let in: after which there was Brawling and Noise for an Hour, and to no Effect, for the Prosecutor was so drunk, that what he said one Minute, he did not know the next. At last he concluded, that if the Prisoner would give him five Shillings, he would excuse her, and let her go about her Business. I should have said, - there was some other People came in, and the Woman would have been clear'd, if they had not perswaded him to charge her, - and that when I asked him how he could lose his Hat with her, he said, he 'went to - (The Witness made Use of a very indecent Expression) and this the Prosecutor admitted, when he was with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030028"/> Woman in the Round house.

            . I was Constable of the Night; this Day fortnight I was sent for, about a Quarter, or Half an Hour after 10, and was told there was a Bustle about a Robbery. Upon which I went down, and found the Prosecutor and the Woman in the Watch-house; Webb was at the Door, and desired to come in; I ordered him to be let in, and then I asked the Prosecutor what he charged the Woman for. He said he had lost his Watch, but found it again in his Pocket. Says I, Do you suspect she took it? I can't say that, and I am sure, (says he) she could not take it, for I held both her Hands. What do you charge her for then? Why, says he, I have lost my Hat, I don't suspect she took it, I believe it was lost in the Scuffle. Then says I, you have nothing to charge the Woman with. No, not I, says he, the Hat cost me Half a Guinea; and if she will give me 5 s. she may go about her Business. I asked him, what he charg'd these Gentlemen for, and Mr Webb? He said, he had nothing to say to them, only begged they would appear next Morning to go before a Justice; but Webb was obliged to go out of Town. After this, by somebody's Perswasion, he persisted in the Charge, and that the Woman should be sent to the Round-House, or some other Prison: she begged to go to the Round-House, and I took the Prosecutor's Word, and Webb's Word 'till next Morning. The Prosecutor said he had got a Knock, and he had received a Blow, but he said he could not tell how he came by it.

It happened about 2 months ago, as near as I can think, (for I am no Scholar). - It happened that this William Swinney was murder'd; I am sure he was.

I did not know the Prisoner before, but I know it is him, because I am positive by the Marks and Tokens that he is the Man. The Deceased said he would not fight; I am no fighting Man, moreover, I am drunk. The Prisoner said, You Blood of a Whore, if you will not fight, I will make you fight. They had not been in Company together, for the Deceased and I had had 2 Pots of Beer together, at the Cannon and Crown in Broad St Giles's. So when the Deceased refused to fight, the Prisoner knock'd him down to the Ground with his Fist; for I believe he had no Stick, nor any other Weapon. When he had knock'd him down, he gave him 3 or 4 Kicks on the Sides, and at every Kick he cry'd, - You Blood of a Whore, there's Dublin for you. For he that is dead, was an Irishman; what the Prisoner is I know not. The Deceased got up, and the Prisoner knock'd him down 3 or 4 Times, and gave him the same Usage, and at every Kick he cry'd out, - there's Dublin for you. The Deceased, to the best of my Remembrance, made no Resistance in Life; he was not able to stand, and he told the Prisoner so before he struck him. The last Kick he gave him was about the Throat, after which he lay a Quarter of an Hour senseless, and stirred neither Hand nor Foot. With that, I knowing the Man that was kill'd, and seeing 3 or 4 Men stand at the Corner, for Fear they were Confederates, I dare not come near to assist my Acquaintance, - for Fear my Life should be lost as well as his. - I am an Irishman, - I never will deny my Country. So with this, the Man lay for the Space of a Quarter of an Hour, and did not stir Hand nor Feet, and I stood all the while leaning against a Bulk. Then the Prisoner came up to me, and said, - You Blood of a Whore, do you belong to that Man? No, really, says I, I don't, - I don't know him; I never saw him to my Knowledge. Says the Prisoner, You Blood of a Whore, you lie, you are one of his Confederates, and so he gave me a Knock on the Side of the Head, as I leaned against the Bulk, and I staggered 6 or 7 Yards, before I fell to the Ground, and then, I believe, he did not give me another Knock. Then here is the Women who stood by and said, O you cruel Man, are not you ashamed to use the poor old Man so barbarous as you do? Meaning me, by the poor old Man. This is one of the Women who cry'd out so, and one Tisdale, who refuses to come, is the other. What is that to you, you B - ch - s, (says the Prisoner) what I do, so they ran in and shut their Doors, for Fear he should do them some bodily Harm. I have no more to say, but a Word or two. The Prisoner, when he left me and the Deceased knocked down, he went with these 3 Men, who stood on the other Side, to a Night-house (one Mr Allen's that was) in St Giles's, but who keeps the House now, I don't know; and whether there was 3 or 4 of them I don't know, but thither they went. The Deceased got up some Time after, and with that he went Home, I believe, to his Bed. His Home was not above 2 or 3 Stones-throw from the Place where this happened: he lives in Vine-Street, Broad St Giles's. I did not go home with him, for I was afraid I was as bad as he, so he went home himself, but I saw him the next Morning in his Bed, about 6 o'clock, and he said he was in a bad Condition. I saw him 4 or 5 Times before he died, in a very weak Condition, as he told me, for I am no Physician. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030030"/> Night before he died, he sent for me, and said, -

I never saw either of the Men before, nor have I ever seen the Prisoner since, till to Day, but I know him again. And all he said, when I spoke to him, was, - What did he tear my Shirt for.

               <p>Hannah Prince. On the 23d of August, I was going from Limehouse to Bow, between 7 and 8 at Night, and not knowing the Way, I desired a Woman to direct me. The Prisoner, I believe, was somewhere behind, and heard me, for he came up and asked me if I was going to Bow. I said, Yes. He told me, he lived near that Place, and would put me in the Way. I returned him Thanks, and we went together through Poplar, and as he went along he spake to several Persons. At last he carried me a Back-way into a Field behind <placeName id="t17400903-44-crimeloc253">Poplar-Chapel</placeName>

I begg'd of him to desist, and desired him not to use me ill, but he slung me upon the Ground, and pinched me, and bit me, because I would not consent. But hearing some People coming along, I collar'd him, and held him as long as I could; then he got up, and as soon as I got up, he knocked me down. He gave me one Blow upon my Stomach, another upon my Arm, and one upon my Mouth, which cut my Lips against my Teeth; then he snatched the Bundle out of my Hands, which I was carrying to Bow, and tore the Handkerchief in which the Things were tyed up, before he could get it away from me. [The Witness gave an Account of the Things contained in the Bundle, as they are mentioned in the Indictment.] It was near 8, when he threw me down, but it was very Moon-light, and I believe I had walked a Mile from Limehouse, before he attacked me. When he had got my Bundle, he ran away, and I ran after him, and entreated him to give it me again; telling him, if he took my Things, I had no more to put on. But he got over a Stile, and ran off; and I, (not knowing where the Path led to,) was afraid to follow him any farther, so I stood at the Stile, and cryed, Stop Thief! Some People came up to me, and went after him, but not being able to take him, they return'd to me, and perswaded me to stay at Poplar that Night. I was very much surprised, and staid there till next Morning; then they carried me to see a Man at Blackwall , who they mistrusted was the Person, from the Description I had given them of the Prisoner. But he was not the Man; so I came back to Poplar, and saw the Prisoner pass by, near the White-horse: Upon which I jumped up, followed him, and collar'd him, and told the People he was the Man. Then I got one to hold him, while I went to see for an Officer, and when I came back; he confessed the Fact, and said he was sorry for it He own'd he beat me down, and took the Things from me, and he pull'd out one of the Handkerchiefs, (which had been in the Bundle,) and return'd it to me; his Mother being with him, he desired her to go home with me, and give me the rest of my Things. I went with her accordingly, and she returned<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030032"/> me all but one Apron; so I returned with her to the Prisoner, and asked him where that Apron was? He was going to tell me , but his Mother stopp'd him, by saying it was lost out of the Hole I tore in the Handkerchief , in which the Things were tied up. In carrying him before a Magistrate, he said, if I would let him go, he would pay me for the Apron, and he did give me a Shilling. There was 2 Men to take care of him as he went along, but some Women rescu'd him , - I believe there were 40 of them about him. But the Gentlemen of the Town (Poplar) hearing the Prisoner was got away, were angry, and sent for the Officer the next Morning, and ordered him to see for him, and take him. He was afterwards re-taken, and carry'd before Mr Justice Jones, where he confessed it again. Upon my Oath the Prisoner is the Man: I walked far enough with him to know him again.</p>

             . The Prisoner was taken on Sunday the 24th of August, by this Woman; and there being a great Noise, and a great many Women about him, he got away, Some Gentlemen hearing he was escaped, sent for me, (being an Officer) and ordered me to look after him. Accordingly I went after him all that Day to no Purpose, but on Monday Morning I apprehended him at Ratcliffe-Cross , as he was going to Work; and having got two Men to assist me, we carry'd him to Poplar Watch-house, till we gave the Prosecutrix Notice. As soon as she came to us, we carry'd him before the Justice, and he owned he knocked the Woman down, and took her Bundle from her. He said he was in Liquor when he did it, and was very sorry for it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Prince. I am sure he walked very upright; and when he ran away from me, he ran a vast Pace. If he was in Liquor, it was not to be discerned.</p>

             that Monday Morning sauntering about at Ratcliffe-Cross ; I asked him the Reason of it? He told me, some Gentlemen at Poplar had threatened him, for not taking a Thief. I asked him if he knew the Man? He said, Yes; and told me who he was. So I carry'd him to an Alehouse, where a Parcel of Lumpers (i. e. Men employed in unloading Ships) were at Breakfast. He saw the Man among them , but I was afraid of their Knives, so we waited a while till he came out, and then we took him. He imme- diately owned he did the Thing, but he said he was in Liquor, and had given the Woman the Things again, and a Shilling. We went down to his Mother, and asked for the Apron which was wanting, and she said her Son had given the Woman a Shilling to satisfy her. Before the Justice he owned he robbed her, and knock'd her down, and said he was sorry for it, and it was the first Fact he ever had done in his Life. I made Answer , and said, - it was too soon now.</p>
               <p>Bomer Loveit . When we were going to Prison with him, I desired him to let the Woman have the Apron that was missing: He told me his Mother had pawn'd it. I went to the Mother about it, and she went with me to the Pawnbroker's; I redeemed it, and the Prosecutrix owned it.</p>

When the Half-Hour was expired, they went away, and I missed my Watch that Moment. I called the Prisoner, and asked her if she knew the Women? She said, no; she never saw them before. I never saw them before in my Life; but the Prisoner brought up the Liquor, and seem'd to know them then, and she was in Company with them 4 or 5 Minutes, but I can't swear she took it. They were lewd Women who were with me, and I lost it in her House, and that's all I know. <rs id="t17400903-47-verdict272" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>Richard Mason. On the 6th of May last, between 1 and 2 in the Afternoon, as I was going to Colney-Hatch , the Prisoner stood poring over the Side of a Pond, and said, there was a large Rat ran out. I said, it may be so. The Prisoner then came from the Pond, and about 20 Yards from it, he pick'd up a Catcher and Ball. Upon that,

            , (who was convicted for this Robbery last May Sessions) stepped up, and bought the Catcher and Ball for Six-pence; and they desired me to go with them, and drink Part of the Money out, because I was at the picking it up. I went cross the Fields with them to Mr. Spencer's, at the <placeName id="t17400903-50-crimeloc283">Adam and Eve at Pancras</placeName>

As soon as we had set down, Clarke went farther backwards, and left his Hat, as if he was gone only to the little House. He returned to the Prisoner and me, and brought another Man with him. Then the Prisoner desired Clarke to lay a Wager of a Shilling, (in play with the Catcher and Ball,) to make the Company drink. The Prisoner and Clarke play'd for a Shilling , and then the Prisoner desired me to give him 2 Six-pences for a Shilling. I pull'd out a Guinea, and 4 or 5 Shillings, and the Prisoner snatch'd the Gui- nea out of my Hand. Then they made a Hustle, and turn'd me out at the Back-Gate of Spencer's House. Finding what Company I was in, I was glad to go off with the Loss of my Money; but they followed me beyond the

I seem'd to draw back, and then the third Man (who is not taken) demanded my Watch; and in the Surprise and Fear, that I was in, (for they put me in fear, when my Watch was demanded,) the Man who is not taken, threw up the Flap of my Coat, and took it out of my Pocket; then he gave it to John Clarke , who ran away with it directly, over the Fields. I made after Clarke, but the Prisoner and the other stood in the Road to boggle me, and so I lost Clarke first, and the Prisoner and the other Man soon after. Upon this, I went back to Spencer's, but I could find nobody in the House, who belonged to it. The second Time I went, I saw Spencer's Wife, and told her, I had been robb'd of my Watch, by the Men who had been there. She seem'd to refuse to hear me, till I told her, I would speak to her. Then she went out at the Back-Door, and hush'd me, that I should say nothing before the Company; and at the Back-Door she told me, she was very sorry, and if I pleased to come again the next Day, which was Hanging-Day, they would be certainly there, and I might take 'em, if I brought an Officer with me; for one of the Malefactors (she said) was to be bury'd there, that Night. The next Day I took 2 Officers, and another Man, and we went thither. I desired the Men to go into the House, and see if such Persons were there. They went, and were inform'd that such a Thing had happened, and then I went in myself.</p>

So he went to Colonel De Veil, and got a Warrant, and Clarke was apprehended very soon after. I am a Turner, and keep a Publick House; the Two Blue-Posts, at the upper end of Drury Lane .</p>
               <p>The Prisoner, in his Defence, urged that the Prosecutor first lost his Money, by wagering with Clarke that he did not catch the Ball upon the little End of the Catcher, once in 6 Times; that he af- ter this followed them out into the Road, and insisted that Clarke should lay a Guinea 6 Times against the Watch, and if he won, he was to have it. That Clarke having won the Watch, went away with it, and the Prosecutor afterwards came to the Prisoner at the George, and told him the Seal which hung to the Watch was none of his own.</p>

            . About May last Mason came to our House, but I can't say I saw him drink any Thing, or that I saw him with any Company, only with a Man in a green Livery, and he was sitting upon a Bench at the Door. I can't say where he went, when he went away, but about an Hour afterward he came again, and asked if his Company were gone? I told him I did not know what he meant. He asked me, if I did not know the People he was with? I said, I knew them by passing by the Door, and drinking, and that they were what We call Orange-Barrow-Men. I asked him, - What was the Matter ? He said he had lost a Silver Watch, a Guinea, and a Gold Seal. Pray what Way? and he said, by the Ball and Catcher, - upon my Oath he did.</p>
               <p>Jury. We would ask her, if he did not say he was robb'd of his Watch, &amp;c. For he might say he lost it, when the People were there with their Ball and Catcher?</p>
               <p>Spencer. He said he lost it - with - the Ball and Catcher. He did not say he had been robb'd, - to my Knowledge. - I don't know that he did.</p>
               <p>Mason. I beg she may be ask'd, if she did not tell me they were a Pack of Thieves, and that I might take them, if I would come there next Day?</p>
               <p>Spencer. I said they were a Pack of Villains, and that they had been with my Husband to treat with him about burying a Man, and the next Day being Execution-day, I judged they would come and bring the Man to be buried. I thought it was a Fraud, - and being a Fraud, I thought he might get his Things again.</p>

I don't know Mason, - but I was going to my Mistress, on the 6th of May (one Mrs Petty, at Kentish Town) and my Master bid me call at Spencer's , at the Adam and Eve at Pancras , for a Pitch-pot. When I came there I saw 2 or 3 Men at the Door, all in a Heap and I look'd in , and saw two Men playing with a Catcher. This was at about five or six o'clock at Night. I went by them into Spencer's House, and got the Pitch-pot. As I went home I met Mason, and he asked me if I had seen 2 or 3 Men pass by? and he told me he had lost his Money and Watch with the Fellow, with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030035"/> Catcher, - he had lost them with playing with a Catcher.

            . The Prisoner was put into Possession of Drury-Lane Play-house, on Account of Mr Fletewood's Misfortunes, and he declared to me, on the 15th of August, that he stole the Lace off the Prince's Canopy; there were 7 Yards and 1 Foot of narrow Lace taken away, and he owned he sold it to Mr. Dinely for 6 d. I have laid it in the Indictment, but at 10 s. tho' I believe 5 l. would not make good what was taken away. I can't be a Judge what it was worth, if it was to have been sold.</p>

I went; and when I came Home, I found my Keys upon the Bed , and the Money mentioned in the Indictment was taken out of my Box. I had left the Key of my Door where I always did, that as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030036"/> she was to come Home before me, she might know where to find it; for she always dressed and undress'd her Child in my Room. As I could suspect nobody but the Prisoner, (for no one else had been in my Room,) I taxed her with it, and she deny'd it. I go a-washing for my Living; but my Husband left me Part of this Money for my Child, and desired me not to break it. When I came home, I found the Prisoner had come in, and was gone out again. I had been abroad 2 Hours, and there are 2 Families live in the House, (6 or 7 People in all) but nobody has the Privilege to go into my Room but the Prisoner. On the Saturday before, she said, she had laid out all her Money at Market, but 3 Pence; and when I charged her with taking my Money, she said, O Lord, I would not hurt you for the World, do you think I robb'd you? I have nothing but a little small Money. But I saw her have Money in her Hand, and told her of it; upon which she ran down Stairs, and I calling out to stop her, she dropped 2 Guineas and 2 Shillings in the Passage. This was the very Day I lost my Money. The Prisoner deals in Fruit, and I have lent her 4 or 5 Shillings several Times to go to Market with. When she was before Colonel De Veil, she took out a Guinea from these Rags, and gave it to the Colonel. The Rags I am sure were in my Box with the Money, but she insisted upon it, that the Money was her own.</p>

I stopped her at the Threshold of the Door, and she dropped 2 Guineas and 2 Shillings. She told Colonel De Veil it was her Money, and she pulled out another Guinea out of her Petticoat, and said she had 2 Guineas more in her Stays; all which Money she begged for in the late hard Frost, and worked for on other Times.

The Prisoner Stuart was in the Booth, and asked me to come in and drink; telling me there was as good Liquor, as any in the Fair. So I went in, and called for a Pint of Beer, but they brought a Decanter of Cyder, which came to 5 d. and I had but a Groat in my Pocket; However, the Drawer said he would trust me t'other Penny. She drank the first Glass, and while I was drinking another, she took the Watch out of my Pocket, and I felt it go + ; at the same Time. As soon as she had got it, she ran out of the Booth, at the Back-door. I pursu'd her to the Door, but found it fast, and was going to break it open, but the Drawer came to me, and asked me what I meant by making a Riot in the Booth, and who I brought in, to make the Riot? I was afraid of going out, for Fear of being murder'd; so there being a Bed in that Part of the Booth, I lay down, and nobody came near me for some Time. At last she came to me again, and said, My Dear, what makes you so melancholy? I hope you'll give me something to drink. And I, with that vulgar Word, call'd her Bitch of Hell, and said, she was the Woman that robb'd me. She told me I was drunk; when I was as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030037"/> sober as I am now. I took hold of her Arm, and said, I would take Care of her, and told the People in the Booth, that she had robb'd me; but they only laughed at me, and made Game of me. There were a dozen People (in all) in the Booth, and I complained to them; but the Drawer got between me and the Door, and rioted me. At last some Men coming by, I told them I was robb'd, so they assisted me, and she was seized, and carry'd that Evening to Holborn Round-house , and the next Morning before a Justice, where she deny'd the Fact, and said, she never saw me, nor knew any Thing of me.</p>
               <p>+ The Prisoner had been indicted capitally for privately Stealing, but the Fact appearing otherwise they were then acquitted, and this Indictment for Larceny directed.</p>

             . On the 18th of August, between 9 and 10 at Night, I was coming through the Fair with two of my Friends, and I saw Simmons have hold of the Prisoner, on the Outside of the Booth, crying out, Help me, I am robb'd. I asked him what he was robb'd of? He said he was robb'd of his Watch by the Prisoner, Yorkshire Hannah , and if you'll help me, I will pay you for your Trouble. Upon this we took her into the Booth, and kept her in Custody while we sent for an Officer. When we had sat about a Quarter of an Hour, Lawrence , the next Witness, said, she had given something to Shilcock. Shilcock ran through the Booth into the Back-place, where the Bed was; I ran after him, and saw him toss something out of his Hand toward the Bed. I suspected it was the Watch, and desired to speak to the Man who belonged to the Booth; but another Man came up to me, and endeavoured to pull me out of the Place. I told them, if they opposed me, I would send them all to Newgate; so at last the Master and Mistress came, and they deny'd that they knew the Woman. I bid them get me a Candle, and as soon as it came I searched, and found the Watch at the Feet of the Bed, and put it into my Pocket; but I would not let Simmons see it, till he told all the Marks of it before the Constable. As we were all coming out of the Booth we saw Shilcock , and seized him, (but I really believe he was so drunk, he did not know what he did) then we got a Light to go with us to London. Shilcock was the Fidler of the Booth; I believe he was so drunk, he did not know (what) one Hand (did) from the other, and I believe he would not have done such a Thing, if he had been sober. The Prosecutor described the Watch in a very exact Manner, before I shewed it him, and then he owned it.</p>

             . Shilcock was my Master's Fidler; he gave him Half-a-Crown a-Day to play there; and I was also a Servant in the Booth. The Prosecutor came in with the Woman, and call'd for a Pint of Cyder, but he had not Money enough to pay for it. Presently he came out, and said he had lost his Watch: the Woman asked him if she took it? He said, no; and so she went away. But when she came again, he went to the Door, and said she was the Person: and several Men coming up, they insisted on keeping her till the Man got his Watch again. The Fidler was eating his Supper at the same Time: I brought him the Bread and Cheese, and drew him a Pint of Beer. The Fidler was not near them at that Time.</p>
               <p>Shilcock. Ask the Prosecutor if he saw me near him?</p>

On Saturday the 26th of July, Mrs Grubb and I told out 205 Guineas, not all in Guineas; but in Guineas and Portugal Pieces, to that Value. I put the Money in a Bag, and then lock'd it up in my Bureau, in the Parlour, behind my Shop. In the Evening I had a pretty deal of Money in my Pocket, so I put 60 L . all in Gold, out of my Pocket into the Bag. On Sunday Morning I went out of Town, and came home on Sunday Evening. The Prisoner, who was my Servant, went out of Town with us, and came home with us. On Sunday Evening I felt the Cabinet, and found it fast and secure, so I did not open it. Next Morning between 7 and 8, my Daughter came to me, before I was up, and told me the Cabinet was broke open. I immediately got up, and found my Bag, and Purse, and all my Money gone, and the Cabinet broke open. It was not unlock'd, for it was a very good Lock, and there was a Plate above it, and below it, to secure it; but it was wrench'd open; the Plates were flown, and the Lock was shot, so that it could not be shut close. All the Money mentioned in the Indictment, was in the Bag and Purse; but I can't recollect what particular Pieces were in the Bag, and what, in the Purse. Upon missing the Money, I called all my Servants about me; and the Prisoner told me, he found the Area Doors under the Kitchen open, when he got up, and he believed the Thieves came in that Way. But I looked at the Doors, and there was no Violence had been used to them, and they were strong and substantial; so I said, possibly they might go out that Way; but which Way did they come in? He said he could not tell, - he was very innocent. I suspected the Prisoner, because all the rest of my <rs id="t17400903-56-deflabel318" type="occupation">Servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"

So I sent for a Constable, who desired he might search the Hayloft and Stables, (for the Prisoner served me as a Footman), and in searching, he had the good Success to find all the Money, and I had it all again. When the Money was found, we tax'd him with it; and he insisted upon his Innocency . After this we searched him, and found a Handkerchief which I had lost some Time, and this Knife in his Pocket; here's an Eye (a Hole) in the Blade, and upon examining the Cabinet, we found every Impression made in it, fitted this Tool, as exactly as if they had been made by it; and the Flap of the Cabinet being lined with green Velvet, had been press'd by the Tool, and in the press'd Part, there was a little Space unpress'd, which exactly fitted the Hole in the Knife. The Prisoner did not lie in the Stables, but over the very Room from whence the Money was taken. I asked him, if he had been out that Morning? He told me, - no farther than the Stables; but remembering he had a Sister-in-law, by Red-Lion-Square, that he called upon sometimes, I went to Colonel De Veil's for a Warrant to search there; but I had no occasion to make use of it; for I asked her if she knew John Weller ? She said, Yes; and told me he had brought her 6 Holland Shirts that very Morning; shewed them to me, and they are the Shirts of a Gentleman who pledg'd them at my House, and they were taken out of my Warehouse. There are eight Shirts in the Indictment; two of them we found in his Possession, one in his Box, and the other in his Room; they are of a coarser Sort; the six fine ones are worth three Guineas, or thereabouts; here are our Tickets upon them. I can't be so positive to these 2, as I am to the other 6, because they were in the Holland when they were pledg'd; but have been made up since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How is it possible, I should take the Shirts out of the Warehouse, when I never was in it 3 Times in my Life?</p>
               <p>Mr Grubb . Our Warehouse-door is generally open, and he goes through the Warehouse to fetch Corn; and Mrs Grubb has been so indiscreet, as to give him the Key, to go thro' the Warehouse by himself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What Character had you with me from my Lady Salisbury?</p>
               <p>Mr Grubb. I was to blame to take him on so slight a Character; I took him on the Character given him by a Servant, and never enquired any farther.</p>
               <p>Mrs Grubb confirm'd her Father's Evidence.</p>

            . The 28th of July in the Morning Mr Grubb sent for me, and told me of this Affair, and that he suspected no one but the Prisoner, and would have had me have taken him into Custody: I called him out, and desired him to take the Prisoner down Stairs, while we searched the Hayloft, and Stable. Mr Grubb said, he fear'd 'twould<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174009030039"/> be to no purpose, for the Prisoner had been out that Morning with a Bundle. I told him, if we searched and found it not, we should but have our Labour for our Pains. So Mr Grubb, and I, and his Brother searched the Stables, and a Warehouse, where he sells Coals, and in rummaging about, we found a Hat: so we searched farther, and Mr Grubb's Brother found a Bag of Money. I took it out of his Hand, and felt in it, and there was the Purse likewise in the Bag. I carried them to Mrs Grubb, and they were soon after carried with the Prisoner before the Justice. [The Witness mentioned the Pieces of Money in the Bag, and Purse, as they are in the Indictment.] The Prisoner said he was as innocent as the Child unborn; but we searched him, and found this Knife upon him, and a Pair of Scissars, and a Handkerchief. The Knife exactly fitted the Impressions which had been made in the Bureau, by wrenching it open. After he was committed, we broke open his Box, and found a Shirt in it, which Mr Grubb claimed.</p>

            . I live in Eagle-street, by Red-Lion-Square, and follow Plain-work. The Prisoner brought me 6 Shirts that Morning, but here are only 5 of them. They have not brought them all right, for this is not one of them; this is one I made for him. He brought them the 28th of July in the Morning (I think) about 7 o'clock, before I was out of my Bed.</p>
               <p>Mrs Grubb . I found the Cabinet broke about about a Quarter before 8.</p>
               <p>Weller. He knock'd at my Door, and said, he had got 6 Holland Shirts for me to mark. I ask'd him, how he came to have so many ready-made Shirts, when I work'd for my Bread? He told me, his Master was a Pawnbroker, and they had a Sale once a Month; and he being in Favour with the 'Prentice and Journeyman, they could get them cheaper for him of his Master, than he could get them for himself. They were Holland, and he told me he gave Half-a Guinea a-piece for them: then he said he was in haste, and went away. He had his white Frock on, and his Velvet Cap.</p>
               <p>Mr Grubb . We have no such Sales at such Times, nor were these Shirts sold.</p>
               <p>Weller . When he went away, he told me, he believed he should come away from his Master next Day, and begg'd I would speedily mark them for him; and four of them being full-trimm'd, he desired I would pick of the Ruffles for him; which I did. In May last he brought me some Holland, cut out for 2 Aprons, with a Piece of coarse Cloth. I made him a Shirt of the 2 Aprons, and this is that Shirt. Mr Grubb took the Piece of coarse Cloth from me. In June he brought me another Piece of Holland, and I made him another Shirt; but that Shirt is not here. Mr Grubb that Afternoon had me before Colonel De Veil. I delivered the Shirts to him, and said he was welcome to search any where in my Room. He put it hard to me, - whether I had any Thing belonging to the Prisoner, and said I must deliver it. I then spoke of the Piece of coarse Cloth, and the Prisoner having given it me, I put a Piece of my own to it, and made me an Apron, and this Mr Grubb took from me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her if, some time ago, she did not go with me to buy a Piece of Holland, to make me 2 trimm'd Shirts.</p>
               <p>Weller. Yes, I did. He lived at that Time with the
