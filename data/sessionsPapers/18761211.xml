                  </hi>. I am overseer of the sorters in the newspaper branch of the General Post-Office—on 18th of last month I was on duty at the Midland sorting division—the prisoner was on duty there as a collector; his duty was to collect newspapers and book packets from the general sort<lb/>ing, and convey them to the dispatch by the Midland mails—about 7 p.m. I observed the prisoner go to the mis-sort letter boxes, which he had no right to do, take a packet 'from a shelf, and convey it to the Midland division, which he had to collect for—he placed it on the Midland table, and I saw him looking at it; he left it there—I examined it, and placed it in the mis-sort box attached to that division—it was his duty then to clear his mis-sorted newspapers and book packets to the blind division—he brought the same packet back again with another collection from the general sorting—I saw him examining the packet there—he then subsequently, on his way to the urinal, which was just in the rear of the Midland division, placed the packet in his left breast coat pocket—I waited for some few minutes, knowing that his collection was getting in arrear—I followed him into the urinal; he was in the further partition—I placed myself in the next compartment to him—I there, heard the rustling of paper—I looked over the side of the partition, and distinctly saw him breaking the packet open—I took him by the arm, turned him round sharply, and told him to return to the office and get on with his duty—he then dropped the packet at my feet, put his hands together, and exclaimed "For God's sake, sir, don't take any notice of it"—I then asked him what it was he had dropped at his feet—he said "A packet"—I told him to pick it up, and as I was in duty bound, I took him to the superintendent's room to explain what he was going to do with the packet—he picked it up and took it with him—I sent for the superintendent, and upon his asking him what he was going to do</p>

               <p>with the packet he admitted that he had stolen it—the superintendent asked him whether he had stolen it, and he said he had—the address that had been on the packet was afterwards found in the urinal and brought in by a boy—it was addressed to Mrs. Thompson, of Dumfries, and it has the post-mark of St. Leonard's-on-Sea—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it; it corresponds with the other portion of the wrapper of the packet—this is the same packet I had seen before on the table in the Midland division—it contains a magenta silk stocking and a letter—there appears to have been another address written on the inner cover, and it had been sent through the Post-Office again with another wrapper over it—the post-mark is the 18th; if it had been posted on the 18th it would have been in the office that day in time to be despatched by the night mail—the prisoner was given into custody—he asked for forgiveness—he said to the constable who took him in charge "For God's sake forgive me."</p>

I live at 37, Swinbourne Road, Peterborough Road—in October I was in the employ of the proprietor of the "Chelsea News," Mr. Richard Russell—I know the defendant by seeing him at the office in King's Road, Chelsea—I was acting as the manager of the paper; it is published twice a week—on 9th October the defendant came, he pro<lb/>duced this pamphlet, and asked me to read it; I glanced carelessly through it—lie then, asked me to insert it in the "Chelsea News"—he went away and called again in a quarter of an hour with a letter; this is the envelope</p>

The pamphlet was headed "The Trial of John Fox, or Fox John, or the Horrors of C*e**rne," and consisted of some hundred stanzas, alleging immoralities at the gardens—there was no printer's name to it—after reading it through, I had no doubt to whom it referred—I believed it referred to Mr. Baum, and judging from the nature of it I thought it was not fit to be inserted in any respectable paper; I did not insert it.</p>

On 12th October, I kept the Crown and Sceptre, Ware Street, City, I have left since—I saw my house properly closed and secured that night—about 5.30 a.m. I was awakened by the police, went downstairs and missed the iron safe, which was all right the night before—there was between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold and silver in it, and one Spanish Bond, No. 29,690; three bills of exchange, which had not reached maturity, and eighty-seven returned checks—a button was knocked off the fanlight over the front door, and the glass was broken—the opening was quite large enough for a person to enter; I got information from a Mrs. Sixpence, where my money was gone—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the cash-box that was in the safe, but there is none of the money there—the safe is at the police-station—I identified it as mine.</p>

I lived at 10, Ware Street, with my husband, at the time of the robbery—that house faces the public-house—on the morning of 12th October, after 3 o'clock, I was awakened by knockings at the street door—the prisoner with his wife occupied the back parlour—I saw him help to carry a safe in with another man, "whom I could not swear to; the front door was shut after they carried it in—about half an hour after<lb/>wards, as near as I can say I heard a noise in the room; the door was closed—I still kept on the stairs thinking whatever they were doing at that time in the morning—in about half an hour I saw them come out of the room and go down the kitchen stairs—there is a back-door to the house, and a way out into a place called Dirty Lane—I then went to bed and know nothing more, but I heard footsteps on the stairs—the safe looked quite black; it was dark—I did not speak to the prisoner's wife—I hallooed as I went upstairs "You are a lot of thieves in this house."</p>

               <p>it was post dated—I parted with my hams simply on Ralph's assurance that they were to be paid for on delivery.</p>

I am porter to Kendall &amp; Co., provision merchants—on 12th September I received instructions and some hams—I went to West-moreland Buildings, Aldersgate Street—I saw on the door the name "Ralph, Victor, &amp; Co."—it was more of a warehouse than anything—I saw no stock there, simply one barrel—I saw Lecomte there—I gave him the hams and told him I brought them from Messrs. Kendall &amp; Co., and I was to take a cheque back; he took the hams, counted them, and gave me this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was already drawn—I did not notice at the time that it was dated 26th September, or I should not have delivered the hams—I took the cheque to my employers.</p>

I am salesman to Mr. Baker, a gun merchant, of 88, Fleet Street—I have seen both the prisoners—I saw Ralph first—he called at our place and asked to look at some guns—he produced this card, and ultimately he selected two guns and some cartridges, the amount of which was 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said "Send them by 4 o'clock to-day"—I said "I suppose you will be there"—he said "A cheque will be given"—I went on 22nd September to Westmoreland Buildings, and saw Lecomte—various things were lying about, but it did not look like a merchant's warehouse—I told Lecomte I had brought the goods from Mr. Baker—he said that Mr. Ralph had ordered them, and asked me for the bill—I gave it to him, and he gave me a cheque—this was in the office—he was at a desk, and he had a pen in his hands, and the cheque before him—I cannot say whether he was filling something-into the cheque, but it gave me that impression—I gave a receipt, and put the cheque in my pocket without looking at it—this is it—he also gave me a sixpence—if I had noticed it was post dated I should not have left the guns—it ought to have been a ready money pay<lb/>ment—the moment I got back I found out that the cheque was post dated—I immediately returned to Westmoreland Buildings—it was about 4.30—when I got there the office was closed and I could not see Lecomte—I went again next day and waited some time, but nobody appeared—I went again on 25th, Monday—I then saw Lecomte—I asked him the meaning of the cheque being post dated—he said that he did not know anything about it; he had merely to fill in the amount, and that Mr. Ralph was in Paris, and if I paid the cheque in it would be all right—when the time came we paid it in, and it was returned to us marked "N.S."</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This was from the witness to the prisoner enclosing </hi>2<hi rend="italic">l. and requesting him to send some pictures similar to some which he had supplied to another person.</hi>) I enclosed in that letter—a stamped envelope—I received no reply, and on 12th October, I called at the prisoner's house, 34, Bridgewater Gardens—it is a printer's shop—I saw the prisoners' wife there, but not himself—I afterwards received this letter in the stamped envelope which I had sent. (<hi rend="italic">This requested the witness to meet the prisoner at Edgware Road Station.</hi>) On Saturday 14th, I went to the Edgware Road Station, according to the letter, and the prisoner came up to me and pushed me by the arm, and said "Well, George"—I said "How do you know my name is George?"—he said "Well, Corbett, what might your Dame be?"—I said "<hi rend="italic">Old friend Bill</hi>"—he asked me what I wanted, I said that I wanted some books, I did not want gems, I wanted something better, I had seen them and had got rid of them, and I wanted Sir Henry Lovell, or something like that—I had never seen one of those books—he said "I suppose you are all right"—I said "Oh, yes, I am all right"—he said "I know the police are after me, and if they get me I know I shall get two—years, some "of them got two years for it, a little while ago, and if I thought anyone was selling me I would rip' their guts out, and the police too if they came there; I am one of the oldest left now, and you will get a good hiding if you come there"—he then asked me for the money—I told him I could not afford to give him the money—he had not said how much it was, but afterwards he said "Will you give me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "No, I cannot afford that, I might not get it"—I afterwards gave him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not. arranged what books he was to <hi rend="italic">get</hi>, but. he was to get two—I was to see him again on Monday—I was dressed in knee breeches and gaiters as a coachman—I saw him on the Monday at his house, and he produced these two books "Fanny Hill," and "The f——Countess"—I have examined them; they are very obscene—I paid him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Monday, making 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., altogether—on 24th October, I went to his house again and asked for some cards—he showed me some; they were not finished, they required colouring and I would not have them—the price was half a crown each; I asked for a dozen and gave him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on account—he showed me a picture of a woman; a very disgusting thing, and said that he was going to take some sketches of it—I saw him again before he finished the—cards, and paid him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—he afterwards brought these cards (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) to me at Burlington Mews, Westbourne Park, and I paid him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more for them, making in all 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on 13th November, I gave him an order for a dozen cards, rather better than those—on 20th November, I obtained two warrants at Guild<lb/>hall, one for a search, and one for his arrest, and on 22nd November, I went to his shop—Sergeant Webb and another officer remained Outside—he produced the cards I have in my hand for which I had arranged to pay him 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., he wanted 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., at that point Sergeant Webb came in and read the warrant—I was with him when the search was made, and produce a list of the articles found, among them were these three manuscript books which are very disgusting, also "Injured Innocence, or the Rape of Sarah Wood-cock," that is printed, and it is very obscene—we also found this "Cata<lb/>logue of scarce books."</p>

               <p>on looking into my cashbox I missed one of the marked sovereigns and one of the marked half-crowns—I went for a police-constable and gave McCarthy into custody at my other shop—I have two shops—that (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sovereign and the half-sovereign—in the evening I was sent for to the police-station by a constable—I went there, and saw McCarthy in the cell—he said to me "If you don't go hard against me, I'll tell you where some of your property is"—I said "It is a thing I cannot promise and I must not promise; I might be placed in the same position that you are"—he said "You have been a very good master to me, and I am very sorry. You'll find some of your property at Howe's, Gravel Lane, the coal shed; there is four sheets and four tablecloths; I sold them two or three days ago for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the man said 'Get as many as you can'"—I then went with the con<lb/>stable to No. 117, Gravel Lane; he knocked at the door—Howe looked out of the window; he said to Roper "Is that you, Barney?"—the constable answered "Yes"—Howe came down and opened the door—there were two constables—I believe the constable said "<hi rend="italic">Davy</hi>, I have come here; you have bought some goods of <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> named Dennis McCarthy"—Howe said "I have not"—I then asked leave to go upstairs—he said "Yes, you may go upstairs"—we went up—directly I got into the room I went over to the bed—I found two sheets belonging to me, with my private mark upon them—the private mark is the cost price—Howe was present—Roper said "Have you got any tablecloths?"—Howe replied "We havn't got any such thing in the place"—Roper found a cupboard, and asked for the keys—he there found five or six more of my sheets—they then proceeded to search generally and found some tablecloths, pillow cases, toilet covers, a table cover, pillow slips, and jacket—I have seen them all at the police-station—they all have my private mark on them—they are all my property—I have been missing things for the last four or five months, both money and goods—none of those goods had been sold by me—McCarthy had no authority to sell at all—they were taken from 25, Cutler Street—that is about four minutes' wait from Gravel Lane—the value of the lot was about 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., cost price—I have sold no linen sheets for the last four months—after all this property had been found, Howe said "My late wife bought the sheets seven, eight, or ten years back"—he said nothing with reference to the other property.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boat-builder, of 17, Love Lane—the prisoner was a lodger in my house—I remember his coming home last Saturday night, at about 8 o'clock, the worse for drink—he came into the kitchen, and began abusing his wife—he threatened her, and wanted her to go up<lb/>stairs, and made a kick at her—I asked him to go upstairs to bed, and fol<lb/>lowed him—he said to his wife "I will let your b——y guts out; you have put somebody on to me; I will set the b——y house on fire," and he took the lamp, which was burning, off the table and smashed it into the fire<lb/>place—the oil flew all about the place, and lighted directly the lamp was broke—I went into the room to put it out, and he up with the shovel and said "I will dash your b——y brains out if you don't go out of my room"—I went for a policeman, and brought him upstairs, and we extinguished the fire—prisoner was in the act of trying to put it out or beat it out with some<lb/>thing in his hand (I am not sure whether it was his cap or what it was) when the policeman came into the room.</p>

My wife wouldn't come up, and this woman who sleeps with my daughter came up and struck me in the mouth and said "You don't pay for my drink," and knocked the lamp out of my hand. I cannot say whether accidentally. I never said "I will set the b——y house on fire."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-Sergeant Y</hi>). On Saturday night, 21st October, I was on duty with Kew in the Holloway Road, near the Derby Arms; we were both in uniform—12 o'clock is the closing hour, and a number of people turned out—about 12.5 a woman spoke to me, in consequence of which I went to a crowd of from thirty to fifty people, outside the Derby Arms, which was mostly composed of men; they were quarrelling and swearing as if they were going to commence a fight—I said "Now, my lads, clear away, it is Sunday morning"—one of the men in the crowd said "You cannot take two"—I said "I don't want to take any, clear away, it is Sunday morning," and the prisoner Conway, who was in the centre of the crowd, struck me a violent blow on my left cheek with his clenched fist, saying "You b——take that"—he had his soldier's grey coat on, and a Scotch cap on his head—he was in the act of striking me again when I seized hold of him, and Kew caught hold of him at the same time—he kicked, and turning to the crowd, said "Let the s—'s have it," and I was struck three violent blows on the helmet with something heavy, which broke my helmet, and I fell with Conway while still holding him—I saw Kew struck, and I believe it was by Cogan and Ken<lb/>drick—we had a very severe struggle on the ground, and Kew was wrested away from us—I got up and was thrown a number of times by Conway, and when I got up the last time I saw Kew in the act of falling on his back in the road—soon afterwards and before I got up I saw Cogan coming towards me with Kew's truncheon in his hand—I had previously heard Kew holloa out "For God's sake have mercy, don't kick me"—Kew shouted out "Look out, they have got my stick"—I drew my truncheon, and Cogan came towards me—I said to him "You scamp" or scoundrel "give me that," and he threw it at his head; it caught against the front of the public-house and rebounded into the road, and as I stooped to pick it up, Conway wrestled himself from my grasp—I picked it up and followed him, he was crossing the road, and as I rushed to get hold of him two men tried to prevent me; I pushed them away and caught hold of him again; he caught hold of Kew's broken truncheon and took it out of my hand, struck me two violent blows on the head with it, felled me to</p>

               <p>the ground, and cut my helmet in two—this is my helmet, and this is the the truncheon (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) it was split like this when I was struck with it, which made it sharp—my helmet was very tight on my head, but it fell off—it was afterwards brought to the station—while I was on the ground Conway kicked me twice on my mouth, saying "Kick the b——s—;" I could tell it was him by his long coat; and I was kicked all. over my body and on my face—three of my teeth were broken off, and my lip was cut in two places and was bleeding—others kicked me—Conway stood in front of me and the others around me—I received a kick on my cheek from Conway which cut it open slightly, but I had put my arms round my head after being kicked on the mouth, which prevented the violence of the blows—I was assisted from the ground by somebody in the crowd; I drew my truncheon and struck Conway on the centre of the head as hard as I could and he fell—I had not used my truncheon before that—Cook stepped up immediately and struck me two violent blows under the left ear with his clenched fist, saying "You b——, take that," and I rushed at him and pushed him over—a man came up on the right and struck me—the crowd formed round me and several men caught hold of me and held me—some one shouted out "Run, soldier, run"—I got away from the men who were holding me and went after Conway, who had run down St. George's Road, which leads out of the Holloway Road, nearly opposite the Derby Arms—I saw Bailey, 448 <hi rend="italic">Y</hi>, and said "I have lost my prisoner, a soldier"—he and Heasnan joined me and we followed them down St. George's Road and found Conway standing in an iron gateway with a woman—I caught hold of him and Heasman or Bailey said "You will 'have to go the station with us, you had better come quietly"—he said "No, you s——s, I will kill you first"—a very large crowd of violent roughs came up, headed by Cogan and Ken<lb/>drick; they seemed to be led by them—they surrounded us, and Cogan said "Don't let them take him away"—I said "No, he will go with us, you had better go quietly"—Cogan used a number of threats and said that we should never take him—a number of bricks and stones were thrown at us by the crowd, some of them surrounded us and kicked and struck us where<lb/>ever they could—we all had our truncheons out—I saw Kendrick throw half a brick—Cogan, who was close to me, said "Knife the b——s," and I received a blow in the back, I do not know from whom, but my coat seemed to be pulled off my back by the blow, it pulled me downwards, but not on to the ground—we were all holding Conway—Cogan went up to Bailey and said "Leave go, I will strangle you," and caught him round the neck—the crowd came rushing in and kicked and struck us wherever they could—constables in plain clothes and uniform came up and I saw Sergeant Gould and Escott—this is my coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), it appears to have a cut behind—we carried Conway face downwards to the Caledonian Road "station; he was very violent all the way—two working men said "You look done up, governor, we will assist you"—they did so, and when I got to the station I fell down in a sort of fainting fit and was attended to by the doctor, and sent home in a cab—I saw Cosgrove in the crowd; I did not remember him at the police-court, I remembered him when I had given my evidence, and before the charge was over; I remembered when it was called to my mind by one of the witnesses, my being kicked, and I turned round and said "You had better not kick me again;" I remember his face as being the one who was behind me when I turned round after being kicked; he was the nearest to me, he seemed to be in the act of kicking me again, and I threatened him,</p>

               <p>with my truncheon—when I recovered at 1.30 I saw Conway and Kendrick at the station; I don't know how Kendrick came there—I have been attended by a surgeon ever since—I was in bed nineteen days and have been suffer<lb/>ing ever since from severe pain down the centre of my back and from injury inside; I am unable to do my duty and was unable to attend one of the examinations—I did not know Conway or Cogan before; I knew Kendrick by name and by sight—I had known Cook a long time by sight previously and I think I had seen Cosgrove, but I will not be sure—I have heard that Conway and Cogan are brothers—on 11th November Cook was brought to my house by Lewis, a detective, who said "Look at this man"—I said "Yes, that is right, he is the man who struck me twice in the Holloway Road"—Cook put his hands together and said "For God's sake, don't say that, governor, I was at Blackwall"—Lewis said "Do you feel sure?"—I said "I am quite sure, I have no doubt about it," and he took him away.</p>

The crowd was not outside the public-house which had just closed, but at a beer-shop 20 or 30 yards off; they were quarrelling and swearing—I think it was Cogan who said "You can't take two," but I will not swear it—I have not been asked that before, and I did not say so when Cogan was before the Magistrate—Conway struck me a violent blow in the face without any provocation whatever; that was the commencement of it—he had not been struck then—I saw Cogan before his brother was on the ground—I first saw Cogan when Conway appealed to the crowd, and said "Give it to the s——s; let the s——s have it"—that was after I had caught hold of Conway—I did not hear Cogan say "Let my brother go away," but later on, in St. George's Road, he said "Let me take my brother away"—I did not say "Stand back;" that was not said at ail—Kew did not use his staff at all in my sight, but I used mine; we all used our staves to keep the crowd off—I saw staves used, and felt them—three of us drew our staves in St. George's Road; myself, Eveland, mi Bailey—this coat was produced before the Magistrate with the cut in it—I did not see the face of the person who kicked me in the mouth, but I saw his legs, and the red stripe down his trousers, and his great coat—I know that Conway belongs to the 77th Regiment—the man who said "You cannot take two," had a white billycock on, and that is my reason for thinking it was Cogan—when I saw him afterwards he was stripped and had turned up his shirt sleeves; he had no hat, coat, or waistcoat on then—I never saw Cogan with anything on his head after the commencement of the affair.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman Y</hi> 196). On Saturday night, 21st October, I was with Lambert in the Holloway Road, in uniform—a woman spoke to us, and from what she said I went to the Derby Arms—the Pied Bull is on the left of the Holloway Road coming from the Archway, and is nearer London—St. George's Road is on the opposite side of the road, opposite the Derby Arms—it was then about 12 o'clock, and the Pied Bull was shut up—about forty or fifty people seemed to be arguing together, and swearing, and causing a disturbance, and Lambert said "Now, my lads, see about clearing away here"—some one in the crowd said "You can't take two, you b——"—Lambert said "We don't want to take any of you; we want you to clear away home"—Conway then struck Lambert in the face with his fist, saying "Take that, you b——"—we then made an attempt to take him into cus<lb/>tody, and be struck me a violent blow with his fist under the right cheek<lb/>bone, which made it swell, and it was very painful—I then received a kick on the bottom part of my body from Cogan; I saw him do it, and he kicked me from the footway into the road—I kept hold of Conway; I pulled him and Lambert with me into the road by the force of the kick—I then received a very heavy kick from Kendrick on the left hip bone, which caused great pain, and caused me to walk lame for over a week afterwards—I was then kicked by Cogan in the middle of my stomach, and cried out "For God's sake don't kick me again; let me get up"—Conway, Lambert, and I, were then on the ground; we were kicked there—I got on my knees, and tried to pull Conway off of Sergeant Lambert, but Cogan took hold of me, with one hand in my belt and the other in my throat, and with several other men I was dragged on to the tram road; they threw me down, and I received a kick in the middle of my stomach from Kendrick, who then ran away with Cogan to where Lambert was, 10 or 15 yards off—I got up, and two more men came at me—I threw them down into the road as fast as they came at me, and Cogan and several other men then came at me, and we had a desperate struggle for my truncheon—I had not drawn it; it was still in the case—Cogan at last got it out, and one of the leathers of my belt was broken in the struggle—I received three stabs, and on looking at my belt there are three cuts in it—I was then thrown down into the tram road, and Cogan came at me with my truncheon in his hand, and gave me a running kick in the pit of my stomach, which kicked the breath very nearly out of my body, and I had to struggle to get my breath again—he said "Kill the b——; kill the s——s"—I got up as well as I could, and saw him going across to where Lambert was, and said "Look out, for God's sake; he has got the stick," meaning the truncheon, and pulled my rattle out and went towards him—Cogan then came to me with the truncheon in his hade and made a blow at me; I placed the rattle up, and he knocked it out of my hand, breaking the tongue of it and bending the pin—I picked it up and went at him again with it, and he came at me again with the truncheon and gave me a tremendous blow on the head, breaking the truncheon in two and splitting a piece off it, as it appears now—my head was cut open, the blood. spurted out, and I became insensible—I was not wearing my helmet the n; I hardly know where it was; I saw it afterwards at the station—I came to my recollection in the Pied Bull, where the divisional surgeon attended 'me after my head was sewn up I was taken to the station, where I saw Conway</p>

               <p>and Kendrick in custody—I was taken home in a cab and attended by a surgeon—I was seriously ruptured—I was unable to leave my bed for three days, and was unable to give evidence till November 13th—I am still unfit for duty—I believe it was the last kick from Cogan in the pit of my stomach which ruptured me—I did not see Cooke or Cosgrove there—I have known Kendrick about two years.</p>

I was on duty in the Hollo way Road, about 12.30, and a woman strike to me—I saw Lambert there—I then went up St. George's Road, and saw Conway turn into, a gateway—I went up to him, caught hold of his collar and said "You must come with me to the station, you have been assaulting Sergeant Lambert"—he then kicked me violently on the legs and hips—Easman came up directly afterwards, and I saw him stoop by Conway's side; I did not see what he picked up, but I afterwards saw a broken staff in his hands—Cogan then came up and said "That is my brother, leave go of him"—I said "I shall not leave go of him"—he then clasped me round my neck with both hands, and said "You b——, if you don't let me go I'll strangle you"—I let go of Conway, he threatened me very much and I struck him across the shoulder with my truncheon—Cogan then let go of me and stepped back among the crowd and said "You b——if you come anywhere near me again I'll stab you"—he drew a knife from his pocket and came up towards me; it was open—I turned my head and saw Escott coming up and cried out to him "<hi rend="italic">Sam, Sam</hi>, come and help me, they are going to kill me"—Escott came up and hit Cogan with his staff, I believe; I cannot say where, but the blow felled him to the ground—Escott was in plain clothes; I did not see any more of Cogan till I apprehended him—I then went to Conway and helped to take him to the station—I received two more kicks from him as I went along, and it was with great difficulty we got him to the station—I went with Witham at 4 o'clock, and took Cogan in the Essex Road; I recognised him, as the man who drew the knife, immediately I saw him—I was injured on my right knee which was very painful for two days—I could hardly move my leg—I was in uniform.</p>

I was at the station when two broken helmets were brought in, and in consequence of what I heard I went to St. George's Road, where I saw Conway in the custody of Lambert and Eastman, and another, struggling very violently and without a hat—I did not see Cogan then, but while assisting in keeping the crowd off the officers who had Conway in custody, I received a sharp blow on the back of my head from somebody, and found blood running down my neck, and immediately afterwards I saw Cogan standing in the crowd without a coat or a hat, and with his shirt sleeves turned up—the blow cut my helmet through and cut my head—he then came towards me, and I saw a knife in his left hand; that was directly after I was cut—he changed the knife from his left to his right hand—I receded from him, but he still followed me, saying "You b——, I will give you this," holding the knife out in a threatening attitude—I drew my truncheon and struck him on the head—immediately after that I was thrown to the ground by the crowd, and while on the ground I was kicked—when I got up Taylor, who was struggling with Kendrick, said "This is the man who struck you on the head with a stone, sergeant"—Kendrick said nothing to that—I took one side of him, and we got him. to the station—there were 150 to 200 people about—I did not see either of the other prisoners.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Officer Y</hi>). On 11th November, I took Cook at 27, Queensland Road, Holloway, which is a common lodging-house—he is a cattle drover; I knew him before—I told him I should take him in custody on a warrant for assault, and asked him to come outside—when we were outside, I told him he would be charged with being concerned with Conway and others in assaulting Sergeant Lambert in Holloway Road, he said "I know nothing about it"—I took him to the station, and from there to Sergeant Lambert's house—I said "Sergeant Lambert, look up and see if there is any one here you know"—he said "Yes, that man there; he struck me on the head with his fist"—I said "Have you any doubt about it?"—he said "No, none whatever"—Cook put his hands together like this, and said "You have made a mistake, I was not there; I was at Blackwall Rail<lb/>way Station"—I took him to the Caledonian Road station, where the charge was read over to him, and he said he was not there; that was at 9.45—I took Cosgrove previous to that on the same night, at the Coach and Horses, Holloway Road—I knew him before by the name of Burke—I went into</p>

               <p>the bar, and said "Burke, I wish to speak to you"—he said "All right"—I said "I want to speak to you outside"—he said "I sha'nt come out"—I pulled him out, and told him I should take him for being concerned with Conway and others with assaulting Lambert in St. George's Road, on the morning of the riot; he made no reply—I took him to the Caledonian Road Station, where he was detained until the witness Field came, he was then placed with three or four others, and I asked Field if he saw any one there to go up and put his hand upon him; he put his hand on Cosgrove, and said "That is the man I saw strike and kick Sergeant Lambert in St. George's Road; I have known him about seven months"—Cosgrove said "What name do you want me by?".—I told him that he could give what name he liked—he said "My name is Cosgrove"—that is all that passed.</p>

I have known him three years—I did not know where he lived at the time, but I do now—I have not been to his house; I did not want to search for anything—I had not spoken to Field about him—Field did not describe him to me; Burke is a man who if you see once you will not mistake him a second time—I had no conversation with Field going along, he was not with me—Cook was one of the men Field had to select from, and there were two others about his own height; they were not policemen, they were prisoners about 5 feet 3 inches high—Cosgrove is about 5 feet 2 inches.</p>

                  </hi>, B.M. I am surgeon to the Y division, and live at 408, Liverpool Road—on Sunday morning, 22nd October, about 12.30 or 1 a.m., I went to the Caledonian Road police-station and saw Sergeant Lambert—he was in a very faint condition, covered with a cold, clammy sweat, and gasping for breath—he was only able to speak in a whisper—his face was grazed on the cheek bone; the skin was broken; his eyes were blackened and three or four of his front teeth knocked out; I thought he would have died at the station from the concussion to his spine and head; his life was certainly in danger—he said "Let me go home," and he was Sent home at once—I visited him at his home two hours afterwards, he was still very ill, but he had recovered—I attended him about three weeks, but he' is on the sofa still, and unable to do duty; he is not out of danger yet, he has symptoms of paralysis in his leg and in his bladder—a violent blow on the head would account for the injuries I saw; he was hacked all over his body; he was sore all over, there was hardly an inch clear—he had great tenderness and bruises all over, more particularly at the bottom of his spine—his condition arises from shock from the violent ill-usage he received—I also saw Kew that morning, who was ruptured, and he also had a scalp wound—I saw Sergeant Gould at the station, who also had a scalp wound at the back of his head—I also saw Escott who was suffering from a stab in the stomach.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Wilkinson, of 27, Queens<lb/>land Road, Hornsey Road—Cook has lodged at our house nine or ten months—I first heard of this assault on the Sunday morning, and Cook came home on the Saturday night at little after 6 o'clock; he asked me to sew some buttons on his trousers—he had his tea and went up to bed about 8 o'clock, and put his trousers outside the door; I fetched them about ten minutes afterwards and put them in my front parlour—he sleeps on the first floor—I then locked my parlour door, put the key in any pocket, and went out marketing—I returned about 10.45, and his trousers were where I had left them—I did something else first and then sewed the buttons on them and put them on a chair in the front parlour, and went to bed; I slept in that room and they were still there when I got up at a little after 5 o'clock; but I was up all night nearly because my baby was very ill—the prisoner has never had more than one pair of trousers since I knew him at about 5.5 I saw my husband take Cook's trousers up to him, and about 5.15 or 5.20 I heard Cook come down stairs; I did not see him, I only heard him, but I spoke to him as he was going out and told him to shut the doer quietly because my baby had just gone to sleep—Cook lodged at our house up to the time of his arrest, but he never sleeps at home on Sunday nights—I saw him next at a little after 5 o'clock on Monday afternoon, when he came home from work and had his tea as usual—he sometimes goes away on Tuesday and sometimes on Friday—I do not know what he does—some times when he does not go to work he is in bed all day.</p>

He was with us up to the time he was apprehended—I was present when he was apprehended—I had heard of this affair on the Sunday morning—I saw the constable at our house-Cook did not speak to me before he went away with Lewis, nor to anyone in the house—Rose Cook, his sister, also lodges with us, and I believe he asked her to find his hat before he went away—he was not told the charge in our house; he asked Lewis what he was being charged for, and they would not tell him; they said that he was to be apprehended on a warrant for having a quarrel with Mrs. Biggs, a person who lives in our neighbour hood, and with that I told him to go quietly—he did not say anything, he put on his hat and off he went, saying "All right, I'll go"—I told him to go quietly, because I thought he would not like to go, and because I thought it would be the best for him—nothing was said in my hearing about any assault on the police, and I was present the whole time—Lewis did not tell Cook in my presence that he held a warrant against him for assaulting Lambert; on my oath he did not; nor did Cook say in my hearing "I know nothing about it," or any words of that kind, and I was there all the time—he did not mention Holloway Road in my hearing—I did not know that he was taken away on a charge of assaulting the police; I had not the smallest idea that it had anything to do with the Sunday morning at the time when Lewis took him away—I believed he was taken on a charge of assaulting Mrs. Biggs; I had heard that they had had a quarrel, but no more; he did not tell me that, his daughter told me—the quarrel was on the Wednesday as he was locked up on Saturday night—the assault on the police took place on 21st October, and I heard of it on Sunday morning, the 22nd; I heard the neighbours talking about it; I</p>

               <p>cannot give you their names; it was nobody who lodges in our house—I heard of it when I was taking my dinner to the bake-house—Cook's sister has lodged with us three years, and she was in the house on the night when this affair of the trowsers was going on; she minds the house when I go out; she is my servant and I give her wages—she is not here—she was out that evening; she was in and out—she sleeps in the back parlour; she slept there that night—she goes in and out of my parlour where I and my baby were—I know Kendrick by seeing him in the neighbourhood; I have known him by sight two years I should say—I do not know what he is—I never saw him with Cook—five other men slept in the same room with Cook; there are six altogether; they were all six at home that night—one mail is named Clark, he went to bed about 11.40—I remember that because I know the time he came in—I noticed the time he went to bed; I always do so to see what time he shuts the house up—he is not my husband—my husband shuts the house up—I remember the time Clark went to bed because my husband asked me the time two or three minutes before—all the other five men who slept in that room have not come here; Arthur Clark and Alfred Cyrett have—Alfred Clark is the one I have spoken of—Cyrett went to bed after Clark, but I cannot say what time—nobody else is here but my husband—Alfred Cole was also there, and William Buck<lb/>land; I do not know at what time they went to bed—Clark has been living with us about ten weeks; I believe he has got two pairs of trowsers—Cyrett has only one pair, I believe; I never saw him with more than one pair—I am sometimes engaged in putting buttons on their trowsers; I mend and wash for them all—Cook went to bed on this Saturday night at a little after 8 o'clock, and about the same time on the Saturday night before; that was about his regular bed hour on Saturday nights, but not for the the others—I cannot tell at what time Clark went to bed on the previous Saturday, but he never went in much before 12 o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> My baby was awake, and I was up almost all night—I also remember that on that night, about 6.30 or 7 o'clock, Cook asked me to buy him a new shirt, and because I was a long time gone my husband got quarrelsome with me and told me to let the lodgers buy their own shirts.</p>

Being a drover he does not go to work on Saturday nights—he generally came home about that time, but sometimes a little later—he went to work on Sundays at a little after 5 o'clock—I think I have sewn buttons on this pair of trowsers three or four different times and I have washed them twice; he was in bed while I washed them; he sometimes gets wet and then he lies in bed while I dry them; there is not another pair for him to put on, he has only got what be stands up in; he has not a pair of trowsers to put on on Sunday, I never saw him with another pair.</p>

Cook hallooed out at his bed-room door "Here are my trowsers," and my mistress went up and he gave her the trowsers; she brought them down stairs and put them in the parlour and locked the door, put on her bonnet and shawl and went marketing, and I went with her—the whole house belongs to me—we did not lock the street door, only the parlour—we came back at 11 o'clock, or a little after, and had a bit of supper, and I reminded my wife about putting the buttons on; I said "You had better put the buttons on the <hi rend="italic">chap's</hi> trowsers"; she would have forgotten all about them if I had not told her—she went out, of the parlour and took the lamp and fetched the trowsers; I think she put them in the back parlour; she put the trowsers back on the chair in the parlour, and there they remained till next morning—I was indoors all night and was up almost all night with the baby; my wife undressed the baby and put it to bed, but she had to get up again, because it was ill—Cook had told me to call him if I was awake, and I took his trowsers up to him at; 5.30 next morning and said "Here are your trowsers"—he asked me the time and I told him it was 5.30 and then I came downstairs again, and Cook got up and put his trowsers on and went to work, and he never returned till the Mon<lb/>day at 3 o'clock—from the time I went out marketing with my wife Cook was in bed; I saw him in bed at 12.15 when I—went up to see that my lodgers were all right, and I spoke to him—he and Clark and Cyrett had three beds together, and he laid in the middle bed of the three; they were talking and I took my lamp up in my hand and said "Now, if you chaps are going to get up in the morning you had better go to sleep," and I blew the light out, and went down and bolted the front door, that is what I call closing my house—I did not go to bed for five or ten minutes, and then I had to get up again; I got up in about an hour and a half afterwards, because the baby was so bad, and was up nearly all night—there is no key to the front door; it bolts—I am able to say on my oath that Cook was in the house all that time, from 8 o'clock to 5.30—he never had another pair of trowsers in my house—I do not know how long he has had that pair, they seem pretty good, I should think he had had them five or six months—he has been in my house nine months, ten months now—he had a pair of cord trowsers when he came, and he gave them to his sister to make a pair for her little boy; when he bought these, four or five months back, he gave them to his sister, Rose Cook, but she took them to her married sister—Rose is the single one—I do not know whether Rose did so, but I never saw the old trowsers again, only when they were on the boy, and they were not in the same shape then—the other trowsers were <hi rend="italic">bran</hi> new when they were bought—Cook is a cattle drover, he works at Blackwall every Saturday and returns home about 6 o'clock—he takes cattle on board ships, but I never was there—his trowsers are generally in a muddy state when he comes home; they have pretty good trowsers in that trade, they are made strong, and they pay 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. extra for them—he goes away on Sunday mornings—if he comes home with his trowsers wet and dirty he takes them upstairs with him—I do not know whether the buttons often come off; I am not aware that my wife has sewn</p>

I reside about half a mile from the cattle market—I never saw Cook driving cattle, but that is his trade—I do not think he is known to the police, or whether they would have an opportunity of observing him driving cattle—when my wife repairs trowsers for the lodgers we do not generally lock them up in our room all night, but we did not care about doing them just then, because we were going out marketing—if Cook was taken ill in the night he would have had to go downstairs in his shirt—we do not generally keep trowsers all night, this was an exceptional case—I get up on Sunday mornings, about 7 or 8 o'clock; I do not care about turning out so soon on Sunday, but the baby kept me up on this night—there is do knocker on my front door, and there is no key—there are two bolts—they have no latch keys, they have to knock before they come in, and they cannot go in and out—the door is open all day long up to the time I bolt it.</p>

I took Cook in custody, and then I heard it from Cook's sister at that time, after I had told him the charge—I did not charge him with that at all; there is no pretence for saying that I was going to take him for that—I did not read the warrant to him—Wil<lb/>kinson and his wife were in the front room; it would be impossible for them to hear what was said, for there were six constables in the passage—Wilkinson did not ask Cook in my presence what he was being taken for, for did Cook say "I don't know"—he never spoke.</p>

I am a police-sergeant, of Colchester—I saw the prisoner in custody at the station-house, on 11th November—I told her she was charged with passing a forged, cheque at Mr. Blyth's, a draper, of High Street, Colchester—she said "I did not know but that it was a good one; my master, Mr. Mussett, of Butt Road, Colne, gave it me the week before last as part of my wages; he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides; he is gone away to North America"—she gave me the name of Smith, and afterwards of Elizabeth Stebbing—the nest day she sent for me to go to her cell; I went with the gaoler—she said "I have a statement I wish to make to you; I have been thinking over it, and shall be glad to get it off my mind"—I cautioned her, and said "You need not say anything, but what you say I shall take down in writing, and it may be given in evidence, against you;' she then made this statement; she also said when charged that she had lived with Mr. Mussett three or four years; (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> Elizabeth Stebbings states:—"The week before last, I believe it was Wednesday or Thursday week, a young man come to see me at. my mother's house, and asked me to go out for a walk with him. I told him I could not go then. He then went out, and I went out about an hour after, and went up the Colne Road and met Mr. Frederick Mussett, of Earl's Colne, near the George Inn. He said to me 'Good evening, Jane, can I see you home?' I said 'Oh, no, I do not want anyone to see me home.' I afterwards went into the George public-house with him, and we had a glass of ale. We then left, and he said he would see me safe home. We then went on the road about a mile. He then wanted to have connection with me, I said 'No, I should not think of such a thing.' He said ho would before he went much further. He afterwards had connection with me. It was about 5.30 in the evening. He then offered me a sovereign. I refused to take it. He then said I have not got any more change only 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I have got a bank note, which he took out of his purse and gave it to me, and I took it, also the 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I said to him 'What am I to do with it.' He said 'You can change it at any shop; you know where I live, at the red brick house, up the Butt Road, and if anyone asks you how you came by it, tell them you have lived with me three or four years, and that is some of your wages. I then went about half a mile further with him, and then left him. It was near Chappell Railway Station. I did not know but what it was a good note. I kept it till I came to Colchester, and changed it yesterday at a shop in the High Street, and bought a pair of slippers, some wool, and some cotton. Elizabeth Stebbings, November 12th, 1876." Elizabeth Stebbings further states:—"On Monday, the 30th Octo<lb/>ber, 1876, about 12 o'clock, I went into Mrs. Cloughton's, who kept a public-house, at Wake's Colne, and in the tap-room I saw Frederick Mussett. I went and sat down by the side of him, and we had some porter. He took out his pocket-book and asked me if I could write, I told him yes. He had a pen and ink in his pocket which he gave me, and asked me to write his name. I did so. He then gave me two cheques, and asked me to write on them, which I did, but I cannot remember what it was I wrote on one of them, only the one I changed in Colchester. He gave me one of them, and that I changed at Sudbury the same day. I saw Mr. Mussett in Sudbury about 4 o'clock. My young man went with me to Sunbury, but he stayed in a public-house, since the time I went and changed it. After I changed it, I saw Mr. Mussett near Mr. Hills, and he asked me if I had changed that cheque, I said 'Yes.' He asked me to let him have two sovereigns, which</p>

               <p>I gave him. I did not see any more of him that day. It was on the Wednesday or Thursday afterwards I saw him again, and what took place then I told you before, and that is when he gave me the other cheque Elizabeth Stebbings, November 20th, 1876."</p>

I am a surgeon, and live at 87, Newington Park Road—on 24th October, in the evening, I was fetched by a policeman—I went to Penton Place and there found a man lying on the path; he was in an unconscious state; he was lying slightly on his right side, more on his back, in the roadway—I bad some brandy fetched, but he was unable to swallow it; he died in a few minutes—I made a superficial examination then; afterwards I made a more careful one, on Thursday, 26th—at the mortuary I extracted a bullet which I gave to Sergeant Underwood at his request—there were noticed on the surface of the body seven wounds; the first was a contused wound over the left eyebrow, that extended to the bone; the second was a graze over the bridge of the nose, I took those wounds to be caused by the fall, they were front wounds; the third wound was a circular one, one-third of an inch in diameter at the back of the neck, about 4 inches below the base of the skull, it was a punched out wound, slightly lacerated—I should judge that was produced by a bullet, I am speaking of the wound where the bullet went in, it was a little to the right of the middle</p>

               <p>The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate was read as follows:—" My intention was to call witnesses, but as I have no means of paying witnesses, I had better reserve my defence. My intention was to make as statement which was the outline of my defence, but as I have no witnesses to prove it, I shall adjourn it. I have no confession to make, because I made a confession at first, and I repeated it in this Court. I intended to give the outline of my defence if I had the power to call witnesses to prove it. Why I applied to the Russian Consul was through the Russian press to take notice of my case, on account of my relatives. I have witnesses, but I am like a sheep tied ready for slaughter, and am only surprised at so much interest having been taken in the case, having given myself up to justice, but I suppose there must be some black patches in the case."</p>

                  </hi> I am manager of the warehouse of Davis &amp; Son, 24 New Weston Street, Southwark—Duke was our time-keeper and has been with us twenty years—he had charge of the paper floor where Smith was also employed—Duke was provided with a book in which deliveries of paper had to be entered—paper brought to our premises is raised from the van by crane which works at a loop hole on the paper floor—Manning was in the employ of Billing &amp; Sons, printers, who print for us—they have access to our premises—I remember Glazier arriving with his van and delivering paper—this is my signature to this delivery note of 7th July—the firm were expecting a consignment from Glossop—I remember seeing a portion of the bundles hoisted up—I should wait to sign the delivery paper until I had received the whole of the paper—I recollect asking Duke the number of bundles; at that time I had the delivery sheet by myside—he called out some number, I don't remember what, but it did not correspond with what was on the sheet—I made some observation and gave the carman a beer ticket—I asked Duke to recount them and he gave me the number 145—I then signed the delivery note—enquiries were made of me some time after, and I and my brother then made enquiries but we were unable to obtain any information—I produce Duke's book I find here an entry of 145 bundles on 7th July—ours is buff coloured paper; silver paper is a thing we do not use at all—we did not expect any, and I do not know of any arriving—if there had been any it would not have been delivered without an entry in our books to that effect.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Davis &amp; Son in July and assisted Smith on the upper floor—I remember Glasier delivering a lot of of paper in July and am sure that Smith was there—Lucy and Appleton were at the crane and I do not recollect the others—some of the bundles were very much heavier than the others Smith and I could carry them between us, but not alone they weighed about I cwt each—the heavy ones were placed in front of the others which were in the middle of the floor.</p>

               <p>Smith was a glass paper printer—it was Duke's duty to see that all the paper was received; the paper received should be put into the paper room—Smith and Duke were in charge of the paper room—Manning was in the service of some printer who prints for my master—Matthews, the carpenter, made a communication to me between 10 and 11 o'clock; I was then on the first floor; the paper room is on the second floor—I happened to get to Duke's bench and saw about 4 reams of paper; and I tore the wrapper on one Side and rent off this piece of paper, upon which I made a note on the same day—I afterwards saw Manning and two lads take those 4 reams of paper out of the warehouse and down-stairs—I went to the window with the carpenter and saw them draw a track out which got into the gutter and three of the reams fell off—there were twenty bundles altogether on the truck 20 reams—it went along Weston Street towards Bermondsey Street, and I lost sight of it—after that I had a quarrel with Duke in August and I struck him—Watkins afterwards spoke to me and I spoke to Duke—I produced this piece of paper, and said that I heard he was going to put Kimber on to me; Kimber is a policeman—I said "Mind I do not put Kimber on to you, and showed him this piece of paper—he said "I thought you had better sense; don't you listens to what other people tell you"—after that.
