                  </hi>. I am in charge of the North Finchley Post Office. I know prisoner; he is an office-cleaner, and does a little work in delivering and collecting letters when we are short. His wages were 7s. 6d. a week as cleaner, with extra money for other work. He came on duty about 6.30 a.m. on August 22. Among the registered letters for delivery that morning was one addressed to Mr. Herring. An entry of this was made in the book produced, and the letter was handed to prisoner for delivery, he signing the "tab," or receipt. The tabs are placed on a file; I have searched the file for this tab, and it is missing. On the postman delivering the letter he should obtain from the recipient a receipt, and this he should place in a little cage at the office. On the morning of the 23rd. when I went to make out my list of receipts, there was no re<lb/>ceipt in the cage for this letter. I asked prisoner for the re<lb/>ceipt; he said he left it at home in his waistcoat pocket. I told him he must go home and fetch it. He went away, and on his return he said, "I did not have the registered letter." I said, "Yes, you did." He said, "Well, where is my receipt</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110007"/>
               <p>for it.' I then made a thorough search, and, not finding the receipt, and the tab and the office list of registered letters being also missing, I reported the matter to the Northern Dis<lb/>trict Office. Prisoner, in his cleaning duties, would have access to the papers that have been lost. I am positive prisoner is the man to whom I handed the letter and who, signed the tab for it.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am engaged as cleaner, and occasionally as sorter and postman by the General Post Office. I wish to say that I am innocent of the charge brought against me, that I neither received the letter nor did I sign the tab, nor did I receive the registered letter from Mr. Warne. I had some conversation with Mr. Warne about the letter on the morning of August 23. At seven o'clock he came to me and asked me if I had a receipt from Mr. Herring. I told him I had not and had never had a registered letter for Mr. Herring. Mr. Warne said, in reply, "Yet, you did; think." I told him I never had it. Again at nine o'clock he asked me if I had a receipt from Mr. Herring. I told him I had never had one. When I told Mr. Warne the receipt was at home in my waistcoat pocket I thought he meant the receipt for a registered parcel I had the day beforehand. At eleven o'clock he asked me again for the receipt, and I went home to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110010"/>
               <p>look for it. I found it, and left it in the office; I put it in the box. he parcel was directed to Holmwood School, Wood side. he first and last delivery to Mr. Herrings would b, carried out by me. I do not Know anything about the missing tab and list.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had the insured parcel for delivery at night time on the 21st, which was a Tuesday. I did not deliver ii that night, as I got no answer. I took ii home "s the office was closed. For the same reason I could not deliver it next morning, and I brought it back to the office. I did not make a third attempt to deliver it, and as a matter of fact I never delivered that parcel at an. On the 22nd I handed the parcel over to Mr. Warne. I afterwards handed back the unsigned receipt. I thought that was the receipt Mr. Warne meant, as he did not ask me for Mr. Herring's receipt but for a receipt. The parcel was afterwards delivered by a postman, who must have had the receipt with it. That was the only receipt I ever had.</p>

Seeing prisoner Ainge come out, leaving the front door open, we entered the first floor back room. Prisoner Hicks was sit<lb/>ting on the bed by the side of a table close to the window. There were a number of counterfeit sixpences on the table, and Hicks was doing something to the coins. I found two moulds for making sixpences one dated 1902 and one dated 1903. Ainge then came in and said, "How did you come in here? I have not been gone five minutes." I said, "I shall take yon into custody for being concerned with this man in manufac<lb/>turing and possessing counterfeit coin." She said, "All right, I will came with you, but do not show me up more than you can help." Hicks, in her presence, said, "Do not take her up, she could not help it. She could not help me making them." I took Ainge to the station. She said, "I am sorry for Bill; he would not have done it had it not been for me," or words to that effect.</p>

We had to send the little child away, and we had to part with nearly everything. The day before we were arrested I said If we could only make a few shillings we could get into the country and do hawking there. I do not think he would have started making these coins but for me.

                  </hi>, Detective-Sergeant, Y Division. At 12.30 a.m. on July 25, I, with other officers, went to 80, Campbell-road, Holloway, which is a tenement house, and knocked at the back room on the ground floor. The door was fastened from the inside, and was opened by the prisoner. I said, "It has come to our knowledge that you have counterfeit coin." He made no answer. The fire was burning, and saucepan (pro<lb/>duced) containing boiling metal was on the fire. On the side<lb/>board I found a mould for making shillings and on the mantel<lb/>piece four bad shillings, so badly made that I cannot read the date. In the oven there were traces of plaster of paris and metal. Hanging over the mantelpiece were some fret-saw blades tied with string. I found an iron plate on the table, a piece of plate glass, and a large file with plaster of paris on it. I said to prisoner, "How do you account for the possession of these things?" He said, "I met a man named Smith in a public-house in the Holloway road, and he brought them here. I brought him here out of pity." There were some woman's things hanging behind the door, and I asked him if he was a married man. He said, "Yes, but she knows nothing about it." There was only one bed. There were no clothing or traces of any other man. I told him he would be charged with possess<lb/>ing the mould and the coins. He made no reply. At the police station, before he appeared before the magistrate, he said. "That man's name is Street, not Smith."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I know nothing about prisoner only that he has been selling salt in the street since last January.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I have seen prisoner with another man out with the barrow, and helping to sell salt. There was a hole in the oven, but I do not know whether the piece of iron pro<lb/>duced was used to cover it.</p>

                  </hi>, Inspector of Coins, H.M. Mint. Mould produced is a single mould for making counterfeit shil<lb/>lings of date 1899. It is very badly made, having a lot of holes through which the metal would run. The four shillings pro<lb/>duced are so badly made that I cannot say whether they came out of that mould or not. The saucepan produced with molten metal in it would be a process for making bad coin. There is tome molten metal in the saucepan. The piece of plate-glass is used for making the mould. I see traces of white metal upon the file produced, and it could be used for making coins. The fret saws would be used for that purpose. The piece of iron has marks of plaster of paris on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I have lived with prisoner at hit wife at 80, Campbell-road. On July 24 I left at 4 p.m., and was work<lb/>ing for a friend. Prisoner had the fret taws and tile file for making a wooden clock. The piece of tin belonged to the oven. Prisoner has not done anything wrong in the room. We had the man Street in to give him a night's lodging. I believe he is a wicked man, and is always in and out of prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I left at 4 p.m. prisoner and Street were in the room together. I believe the fire was out. I have only two big saucepans for cooking, and have never seen the small saucepan produced, or the piece of plate-glass or the bag of plaster of paris. Street came on the Saturday, June 21. Prisoner said he was hard up, and he had brought him home because his wife was in prison and he had nowhere to go to. He took him in out of charity. I gave him a bit of food that I had. My husband was out with half a ton of salt on the Satur<lb/>day, Monday, and the Tuesday. He usually went to bed at 10 or 11 p.m. Street slept on the floor on the Saturday and Sunday nights.</p>

I have committed no crime. I never have and never will. I have not been in the hands of the police before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a married woman, not living with my husband. For some time previous to the end of July I was living with prisoner as his wife at 47, Dante Road, Newington. He is an engineer's labourer; he worked on and off. Home necessaries were provided through men friends of mine.</p>
               <p>By the Court. That means I was carrying on a disreputable life and got money from them.</p>
               <p>By Mr. Smith. Sometimes I took men home to my room. The prisoner knew it, and did not like it, but there was no help for it. On Friday night, July 27, I got home at 12.45. Pri<lb/>soner said I was late, and hit me about the head and neck with his fist. I screamed He said he would stop my screaming, and hit me a heavy blow with something I did not see. I had my back to him, and was leaning over a chair hiding my face. It stunned me. When I became conscious I was bleeding, and he helped me get to bed, and stayed with me all night. He seemed sorry for what he had done. I was fainting all night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110015"/>
               <p>from loss of blood, and he was giving me water. He said he would take me to the hospital, but I would not go. He was angry, and said he ought to have finished me. I dressed and went with a friend to St. Thomas's Hospital. When my wounds were dressed they gave me an order to go to the infirmary. I thought I would rather go home. They said it was dangerous for a time, and I went to the hospital four times.</p>
               <p>By the Court. I did not hit him. I paid the rent and kept the place going. I did not say before the magistrates I gave him no money. I did not put up a knife and say I would knife him. We did not struggle together on the floor, and he did not take a knife from me. I did not pick up the tongs and go to strike him. There was no fighting or struggling.</p>

                  </hi>, a qualined medical practitioner. On July 311 was casualty officer at St. Thomas's Hospital. On the afternoon of that day Emma Jones came to the hospital. I examined her, and found she had a large scalp wound at the top of the head, at the back, about five inches in length; it went down to the bone at one place, and there must have been very severe violence used. I should not say it was caused by a fall. It is quite possible the wound was caused by the poker produced. She was very pale; pulse not good; she had ap<lb/>parently lost a good deal of blood. I only saw her twice; my colleague saw her afterwards. The wound has healed. It might have become dangerous; in fact, for some days the was in a critical condition as an abscess formed in the wound.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-Sergeant, L Division. About 10.30 a.m. on July 31 I saw prisoner in Borough Road. I said, "What is your name?" He replied, "Saunders; I know all about it; I am not going to run away. Is she dead 1" I re<lb/>plied, "No; I am going to take you into custody for unlaw<lb/>fully and maliciously causing grievous bodily harm to Emma Jones on Saturday last." He said, "I could not help it; the provoked me to do it." He was taken to Kennington Lane Sta<lb/>tion, where the poker was handed to me. He said, "That poker was not like that when I left it—it has been done by somebody else."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PRISONER</hi>. He asked me whether I had done her in I asked if it had killed her. He said, "No, she is all right." I have no further statement to make, except what I have handed in.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's written statement. On the night of July 27 I was at 47, Dante Road, when she came home at 1.30 the worse for drink. We had been out together and had two or three drinks. T left her and went back She said, "I am going to get a bit of supper; I won't be long." That was just after 11 o'clock. When she came back I asked her where she had been. She said, "What has that to do with you? You are nothing to me. I shall come home when I like." I said, "You will ruin</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110016"/>
               <p>yourself if you go on drinking and carrying on like this." She said, "You know what to do if you don't like it." I said, "This is all the thanks I get for taking you from a bad life." She then fell into a temper. I accused her of being out late and doing no good. She said she would knife me, and we fell on the floor, and she picked up the tongs and went to strike me on the head. I then picked up the poker and struck her back, in self-defence.</p>

                  </hi>. Prisoner is my husband. We lived at Harringay. On the night of July 31 we were in bed. I awoke by his sawing my throat with a pen-knife produced. I jumped out of bed, and caught hold of him, and after a time quieted him, and he put the knife away. He said he was doing it be<lb/>cause somebody else outside wanted to murder me, but he would not let them, and would do it himself; he did not want me to be "mangled." I went downstairs into the kitchen and sat there, but occasionally watched him. He came down and took some matches up. I saw some light in my son's bed-room, and thought he had come in. I went up and found the curtains burning. I put them out, and then I saw a flare downstairs. I went down and put that out. I saw my hus<lb/>band in the room with a poker in his hand and he hit me on the head with it as I turned to throw the blind out. He said he would kill me. My son came down and I saw some police<lb/>men outside and my son got one. Prisoner was taken to the station. He brought a table knife out of his pocket in the bedroom. He said it was for someone outside who meant to come in, and he wanted to protect me. He was under Dr. Savage nine years ago for his head. He had been drinking and a little affects him. It was the heat that finished him off I am sure. July 31 was very hot. He is a quiet, affectionate husband when all right, and is a good man. He had not the faintest idea what he was doing. The wound was really nothing. I was frightened of the fire—nothing else. I was not hurt by the blow on the head.</p>

                  </hi>, widow, 9, Francis Court, Barclay Street, Clerkenwell. On Saturday night, August 4 last, I was in "St. John's Tavern" with my two sons, Charles (the deceased) and Thomas and his wife. Prisoner was in the opposite bar; he beckoned to deceased and I said, "He is not coming." He beckoned again, and I said, "Go and see what he wants." They went out and I followed shortly after, when I saw Charles lying on the pavement insensible. He was taken to the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, House Surgeon, St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Charles Edwards was brought in about midnight on August 4. He was unconscious, and it was clear, later on, that he was suffering from some serious brain injury. An operation was performed three hours later. He had a frac<lb/>tured skull, brain hamorrhage and laceration. He died four hours after. A post-mortem was held. He had blood over the right side of the brain, and the brain was lacerated each side. The cause of death was laceration of the brain and pres<lb/>sure of blood. The fracture of the skull would be consistent with his falling on the pavement, which would account for the laceration and haemorrhage.</p>

When I came out there was a fight outside so I went away. I met Edwards at Mr. Wright's and thought I would like to treat him and beckoned him out. His mother said, "He is not coming." I said, "Only for a minute," and he came outside and I smacked him by the side of the face and said, "There's no harm in me if there's any harm about," and he fell down.</p>

                  </hi>, 157, Hampstead Road. I have been married to prisoner over 22 years, and was separated from him on June 1 last by order at Marylebone Police Court. Nine weeks after the separation I received the following letter from pri<lb/>soner: "This is to let you know that I am not going to starve while you have 25s. a week. Remember I am your husband still, and remember you Left me after 25 years of married life to suit yourself, for no reason on my behalf. If it had not been for the lies you and your tribe told the magistrate you would not have got a separation, and your solicitor, who was found for you If I don't hear from you between now and Monday I am coming to see you. I am in earnest. You can show this to the police or the magistrate, or any of your pals; for I am ready, come what may.—I remain, <hi rend="smallCaps">WALLACE LITTLE</hi>, once your loving husband." I saw him on July 31 outside where I work as an upholsterer in Hampsrtead Road. He came up and said, "Have you had my letter?" I said "Yes." He said, "What are you going to do?" I said, "You can't expect me to do any<lb/>thing, for you have wilfully broken up my home, and I am keeping myself and children and trying to renew the home." He said, "I don't intend standing this any longer. If you don't make up your mind between now and Saturday, you won't live three days—I am not kidding—I mean it." I said, "I have nothing to spare," and walked on. I saw him again on August 7 at the corner of Netley Street. I said, "Oh, can't you let me be in peace?" He said, "It will be all peace with you</p>

               <p>when I have done with you. Now I have got you I am going to finish you," and he struck me about the head several times with a hammer [produced]. Somebody seemed to stop him, and then he seemed to take hold of me and threw me and I fell in the road. I was taken to the hospital, and, after my head was dressed, they took me in a cab to the police station. I was a patient at the hospital for eight or ten days. The wound it now healed.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I don't recollect anything. I have nothing to ask.</p>
               <p>By the Court. He seemed sober and spoke like one in hit senses. I thought he was going to ask me for money. He came to me quite calmly and took my two hands, and drew my face on to his coat and struck me with the hammer.</p>

He said he would kill the three of us. I saw him again next day in the street. I said, "Hullo, dad!"He said, "Did you tell your mother what I told you to?" I said, "Yes, father, and mother says she it not going to have anything to do with you, and has quite enough to do to keep the children."

                  </hi>, House Surgeon, London Temperance Hospital. I saw Mrs. Little about 9 a.m. on August 7. She looked rather pale and had a curved wound on the top of her head about 11/4 in. long. The edges were rather jagged. It went down as far as the membrane covering the bone over the right ear about 1/8 in.; 2 in. above the right ear was a small wound about 1/4 in. long. On the left upper arm there was a bruise, and on the left forearm an abrasion of the skin. The wound on the head might have been caused by the hammer or any blunt instrument. Not a great deal of force would be re<lb/>quired. The wound healed in seven days. I see no reason why she should suffer from after ill-effects. The whole skull is a dangerous part to be struck by such a weapon.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the magistrate: I am very sorry. I was not in my right mind, and have not been since she got a separation from me without cause. Had I been in my right senses I would not have done it. (By the Court.) I have not been out on bail. I told some witnesses to come yesterday.</p>
               <p>Prisoner handed in a written defence, repeating his former statement, and alleging that his wife left him prior to her getting the separation order, which she obtained by untruly stating that he ill-used her—that she could not have been much injured or the doctor would not have let her go to the police-station to charge him—that on one occasion he cut his throat owing to her conduct towards him, and that she afterwards got some poison and put it on the mantelpiece for his daughter Maud to give him.</p>

He came home in a cab the Saturday previous to the Easter that he cut his throat. He was indebted to his landlady and I said, "You ought to know better than to come home in cabs." He said, "If I have any of your language and cheek I will give you something for yourself." I said, "Keep your dangerous hands to yourself." and he beat me severely. I took out a summons at Clerkenwell, but instead of my appearing I said to him, "Do you think you can alter if I do not go there to-day?" He said, "Yes: I know I can." I said, "You can if you try," and he promised, and I said I would not go there. He went to work on the Tuesday that he cut his throat.</p>

                  </hi>, single woman, 14, Little York Street Bethnal Green. On Monday, July 30, at a quarter past nine I left my house, and as I came to the corner of the street these two men came up to me. Smith snatched my purse and ran away. I had a chain twice round my wrist. The chain was broken. I shouted, and Leslie punched me in the back of the neck, and then got in front of me and punched me in the chest. There were several other men there. I have known Leslie about the neighbourhood for five or six years, and have no doubt he is the man who struck me. The purse contained about 25s. 3d., and was worth about 2s. 6d. The two men ran away, and Smith was stopped by a policeman. I saw Leslie the same evening ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after the robbery. On August 2 I saw Leslie at the police station, and was able to pick him out from amongst other men without hesitation.</p>

I also saw prisoner Leslie there. He got behind my sister, and punched her in the back of the neck. He said something to her, and then he got in front of her, and punched her in the chest, and put his foot out to trip her, but my sister kept up. Smith was arrested and</p>

               <p>taken to the station. I saw Leslie on the way there following behind. There were a lot of other men there. It is a roughish neighbourhood. I did not give him in charge at the time because I was afraid, and hung back. Half an hour afterwards I saw Leslie again in Shoreditch. He came up to my sister and asked her whether she was going against his friend. My sister and I tried to get away; we did not know what to say to him, and we should soon have had a crowd round. Leslie said he would give my sister the value of what she had lost if she would not go against him, because if she did he would be "sent home," otherwise sent to prison, and he asked her to meet him in the morning at the corner of Old Shoreditch Church, which is close by the police court.</p>

Turning round, I saw prisoner Smith running out of Little York Street. I was in company with another constable, and he ran into our arms. I said, "What is up now?" He said, "You must have made a mistake, governor." He dropped the purse produced, which the prosecutrix came up and identified. I then took him to the station.</p>

I saw Cobham pick up the purse, which Smith dropped at our feet. The prosecutrix alleged that she had had her purse snatched by Smith, and had also been assaulted by another man. She pointed out Leslie as the man who had assaulted her. He was with a lot of other rough men. I had known Leslie for some time, and have no doubt he was the man who was pointed out to me on that evening. I did not arrest him at the time on account of the crowd of his hostile associates, and I was apprehensive that if I arrested Leslie the women might be seriously assaulted.</p>

I did not come back from Southend until Saturday night," I took him to the station after some difficulty, and he was there identified by all the witnesses. When charged at the station he said, "It is just my luck." and, turning to the prosecutrix and her sister, he said, "You f——ing cows, if I am nut away for this I will put aid to you when I come out."

                  </hi>, 36, Shadbolt Street, Bethnal Green, pedlar. On July 23 prisoner Leslie went with me to Romford, and after<lb/>wards to Billericay and Southend. We were away nine days, and returned to London on July 31 (Tuesday), at 6.30 in the evening. On Monday we were at Romford, and worked the place with clothes props. We slept that night at No. 4, Water<lb/>low Road, Romford, which is not a lodging-house, but a private house. (Witness produced a photo of himself, prisoner, and a companion, showing also ten dozen of props on a barrow.)</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The photo was taken on Saturday after<lb/>noon. A man said, "I will take your photograph for 4d." It was early in the afternoon outside a gateway. We worked Romford on the Saturday and Monday, and sold some of these goods. I do not know Smith, the other prisoner. He is a perfect stranger to me. I was in a little trouble myself six years ago. I am not ashamed to own it. I had eighteen months. I have since had trouble with the police on six occa<lb/>sions on account of drunkenness; but nothing else. I know a man called Dummy Roberts. I do not know Harry Clift nor Cotton. I know Dairs. I do not know Ginger Murray, nor Echo, Harding, or Foster. Dummy Roberts is a relation of mine. As to whether he has been convicted many times for felony, that has nothing to do with this case.</p>

                  </hi>, licensee of "King William IV." public-house, Wandsworth Road. On April 12, at about 10 p.m., prisoner called for a drink and tendered counterfeit crown piece pro<lb/>duced. On my telling him it was bad he became abusive and was given in charge, taken to the station, and after inquiry dis<lb/>charged. At the station he said it was I who abused him. So I did. I told him what I thought of him. When I was giving evidence at the police court on this charge, prisoner interposed and said he was very drunk. Had he been drunk I should have had nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Had he been drank. I should not have served him. One's reputation wants defending in these days. I say he was not drunk. He also said he was drunk on the occasion he offered Mrs. Fuller the half crown. I do not know why his statement that he was drunk when tendering a crown to me is left out of the depositions. I could not posi<lb/>tively say the remark was made while I was giving my evidence. prisoner paid for his drink afterwards. At the police-station the officer refused to take the charge. I knew nothing about prisoner when he tendered the coin to me.</p>

                  </hi>, 917 W. On April 12 the last witness gave prisoner in charge for tendering a bad crown piece, produced. prisoner on the way to the station said, "I did not know it was bad. I had been saving up for the holidays. If you want to know my character go to the South-Western." I searched him; he was quite willing, and found 1s. 6d. in silver and 4d. in copper in good money on him. The charge was not taken. I identified prisoner on August 20 as the man who offered the crown piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. prisoner never did deny he tendered the bad 5s. piece. I know prisoner's name is William Coombes, which is the name he gave, and everything he told me on that occasion is correct.</p>

I gave him a florin and three pennies in change. Think<lb/>ing the half-crown was bad, I sent my son after prisoner, and he was brought back by a policeman. He refused to be searched in my dairy.

               <p>Cross-examined. I served prisoner. There was no one else in the shop. I gave him three eggs in a bag, a 2s. piece, and</p>

               <p>three pennies. I remarked nothing unusual about the prisoner. I thought the half-crown was wrong at once, hut I thought I would be quite sure, and consired it with another one. By the time he had got down the step I discovered it, and called to my son quickly to stop him and ask him for the change. When he came back I asked him for the 2s. 3d., and if he had given me the 2s. 3d. I would have been satisfied. He refused He said he had not been in the shop; he knew nothing about it.</p>

He was running across the main road when I got up to him. He then turned round and sat down on the railings. I told him he had given my mother a bad half-crown. He said, "I do not, know what you are talking about." I told him he had been to the dairy in Claylands Road and given my mother a bad half-crown, and I should follow him until I saw a policeman. Then my mother came up, and he refused to give up the change to her. Then he crossed the road again. I fetched Police<lb/>constable Ashwell. My mother handed me the coin, and I gave it to the policeman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I swear it was the prisoner who came out of the shop. He was sober. I did not see any eggs at all.</p>

I then took him to 8, Claylands Road, where Mrs. Fuller said, "You gave me a bad half-crown for those eggs you purchased." prisoner repeated that he had never been inside her shop. Prosecutrix said she was certain of his identity. I took him to the police-station, he was charged and made no reply. I found upon him a florin, a shilling, and three pennies. He gave his name as William Oswell.</p>

I could not remember ever going into the shop. I had no false coins in my pocket to my knowledge. I remember tendering the bad crown piece in April last. I did not know it was bad. I have been employed by the railway company for six years and five months, and am in regular employment. I am paid piece work, and receive from £1 7s. to £2 12s. a week—averaging about 34s.

                  </hi>, Police-constable 611 City. On July 21 I was on duty in Gutter Lane, City. At 6.5 a.m. I saw the prisoner Desmond walk slowly through Gutter Lane into Gresham Street, along Gresham Street, round St. Martin's-le-Grand into Cheapside, where he was met by a second man not in custody. They then went into Gutter Lane, remained there two minutes, walked through Goldsmith Street into Wood Street, into Cheapside, and into Gutter Lane again. They stopped outside No. 34 and then separated, Desmond again going into Gresham Street, round the Post Office into Cheapside and into Gutter Lane again. He was there joined by the second man; they walked down to No. 34, and I saw Desmond look up at the first floor and point towards Cheapside. They again separated, Desmond walking down into Gresham Street. It was then. 7 a.m. I went to him and said. "I have been watching you since just after six. Will you explain your busi<lb/>ness?" He said, "I am waiting to go in to work. What do you think?" I asked him where he worked and his name, and he said, "Davis, and I am in business for myself." I took him to the station, and in the first instance he was charged with being a suspected person frequenting those streets. The iron bar produced was found beneath his waistcoat. He made no reply to the charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. He did say his name was Davis.</p>

                  </hi>. Sergeant 31 City. I was informed of the arrest of Desmond, and, in consequence, observation was kept upon certain premises in Gutter Lane. At 8.20 a.m. I went inside No. 34, and found a wareroom door on the first floor had been attempted to be forced. There were marks showing a jemmy or chisel had been used. On the second floor I found the lavatory door secured. As I was about to force it open it was unbolted. I went in and found the prisoners Lawrence and</p>

               <p>Wilson. Lawerence had a bag containing a drill, a bicycle; lamp, bunch of keys, two jemmies, and two screwdrivers. They were arrested and taken to the station, where, in the presence of Desmond, Lawrence said to me, "They have not pinched the chap that was outside, have they?" When they were charged Desmond said to Lawrence, "Do you know me?" He said, "I must do if they say so." I then returned to No. 34, Gutter Lane, and found that on four different floors had been broken into Mr. Baudet's office it on the second floor. That was broken open, and two drawers forced. On Lawrence I found 130 postage stamps, one silk necklet, three silk handkerchiefs, £5 8s. in money, two watches, two keys, two brooches, and other things. On Wilson was found £2 13s., a leather case containing eight cigars, a case containing a pawn ticket for a coat, a pair of spectacles in a case, three pain of pince-nez, tobacco pouch, and knife.</p>

Baudet. On August 21 I unlocked the outer door at 8.20 a.m. Finding our door had been tampered with I called in a constable, who arrested Lawrence and Wilson in the lava<lb/>tory. Behind the closet I found several silk scarves and a case with seven cigars.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. At the Mansion House I said I recognised Desmond by the cut of his clothes and the colour.

It was a letter put in an envelope, and they gave me a big book to take back to the "King's Head." The man opened it and took prices out of it, and wrote them down on another piece of paper and put it in another envelope. He said, "Go over and get these things and I will give you a shilling."

Catterson's man said, "I will give them to you in a minute or two." and I said, "I will go out and have a glass of ale," and Hicks and me had a glass of ale. We then went back into the shop.

Between three and four o'clock on September 4 I was in the Railway Arches, Church Street, Deptford, and two men were trying to buy some harness of me. Prisoner came up and overheard the words I said. He said, "You want half a sovereign for the harness. It ought to be tied round your neck and thrown into the river," and he gave the harness a kick and scattered it about the ground. I said, "Why do you not go away?" Prisoner picked up a chair bedstead, with the remark, "This will do," and I went alter him and he threw it at me. I carried it back to the barrow, and he struck me and straightened me out. I got up and closed with him. He took a black port wine bottle and struck me. I grappled with</p>

On the morning of August 8 I was called by Mr. Tucker, and I saw him struggling with prisoner on the landing outside their room. He asked me to hold her; she was in a state bordering on frenzy and madness. He asked her, "Where is the child?" She screamed for some time and then called out, "The copper." My wife and I went downstairs, and on lifting the lid of the copper we found the body of the child, Sidney Victor Tucker lying in the copper, which was full of water. The police and the doctor were sent for.</p>

                  </hi>, 48, Thorn Road, South Lambeth, labourer. Deceased was my wife; she was about 33 years of age; we have been married 10 years. I have known prisoner four years; he lived with us about two years. He was employed this year at the L. and S.W.R, goods yard, Nine Elms, as a crane driver. He was in the main a regular worker, although I have some<lb/>times seen him the worse for drink. On the night of August 25 prisoner, myself, and my brother Walter were in the "Wheat<lb/>sheaf," Lambeth Road, about 6.30; we had a glass of ale each. From there the three of us went to the "Builder's Arms," where we had another glass each. About 8.30 my wife came in with prisoner's mother, and we had some more ale. prisoner and I were playing dominoes, and the loser paid for the drinks. When we left the "Builder's Arms" we were none of us drunk. We all five went to the "Wheatsheaf "; we were all very friendly</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110039"/>
               <p>together. In the "Wheatsheaf" two women, employed at the same place as I am, came in. My wife said to me, "See those?" I said, "Well, I can't atop people coming in the house." She said, "Well, drink up and come out." We five then weal to the "Duke of Cambridge;" this was about half-past nine; we had some more drink, for which prisoner paid. I heard my wife say to prisoner, "George, have you got my sixpence?" He said, "Yes, take your sixpence; you are very sharp on it;" it was not said in a very pleasant way. prisoner then went out<lb/>side with Walter. In one or two minutes prisoner returned, opened the public-house door, and delivered a blow at my wife which I thought was a punch; then I punched at him, and the potman turned us outside. I heard Walter call out to me, "Tom, she is stabbed." I had not noticed anything in prisoner's hand. My wife was taken to the surgery; there I called pri<lb/>soner a dirty cur, and said, "What aid you do that cowardly thing for?" He made no reply. My wife was taken to the hospital, and the next morning I saw her dead.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. prisoner and my wife and myself had always been on friendly terms. The week before this happened pri<lb/>soner had not been to work; I do not know that that was be<lb/>cause he was ill. From about 6.30 to 10 on this night we had been drinking. It is not the fact that prisoner gave deceased a shilling and asked her for sixpence change. My wife, when we left the "Wheatsheaf," kept on talking to me about the women, but I took no notice; prisoner and Walter said to her, "Stop it, Kate." I did not see deceased smack prisoner in the face; I did not hear him say," After that I have done with you, Kate." I remember my brother, who had been walking with deceased, bringing her up as we reached the "Duke of Gam<lb/>bridge," and saying, "Kate is all right now." She was not so angry and excited then. There was a piano-organ outside the house, and she went outside; I cannot say whether she danced to the organ. I do not say that she was "pretty well on" then, but she had had a drop. She did not again begin to complain about women, and prisoner did not say to her, "Don't start another row here," or "Stop it, Kate." I did hear her say, "You b——well know where to go when you want to borrow sixpence "; I did not hear her say to him, "Mind your own b——business."</p>

                  </hi>, brother of last witness. I remem<lb/>ber the visits to the public-houses spoken to by my brother. When prisoner left the "Duke of Cambridge" I went with him; we went to the urinal outside, about 30 yards away. In the urinal prisoner pulled a knife out of his pocket and opened it and said, "This is for Kate "; this he said in a joking way. I had seen that night nothing between deceased and prisoner to cause any ill will. I said to prisoner, "Put it away, Greasy,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110040"/>
               <p>don't be such a fool." He shut it up and put it away, to my idea. We returned to the bar, still joking on the way—laugh<lb/>ing and pushing each other. He seemed all right; he seemed very happy; I had had a few drinks, but none of us was the worse for drink. We were away from the house about five minutes altogether. When we got back, deceased was standing just inside the bar, talking to prisoners mother. Prisoner walked in first, I just behind; he pulled the knife out of his pocket and made a lunge at the woman's breast. I did not see him open the knife. I did not see him take it out, but I saw it sticking in her breast, and it all came to me what it was. He struck only one blow. The knife produced is the one I saw in the urinal and afterwards sticking in the breast Nothing was said before he struck the blow; he went straight in. My brother thought prisoner had only hit her, and they started fighting. After striking the blow, prisoner shouted in the bar, "I've done it!"</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not hear any nagging between de<lb/>ceased and her husband. I heard a lot of talk about there hav<lb/>ing been nagging inside the "Wheatsheaf," but I was not inside at the time. It is not true that the nagging continued outside. I did not say, "Stop it, Kate," and did not hear prisoner say it. I did not see her smack his face or hear her say, "I've got one husband and don't want you to dictate to me." I did not hear prisoner say, "After that I've done with you, Kate." All that is untrue. I said just now that the urinal was 30 yards from the public-house. [On plan produced it proved to be about 50 ft] I am not much judge. When prisoner said, referring to the knife, "This is for Kate," it was in a joking way; we were both joking together. We were not the worse for drink; we had our minds about us. When prisoner put the knife away he shut it up; he must have done. I swear that he shut it up and put it away. I did not see him open it again; I can<lb/>not account for how he opened it. He very likely opened it in hit pocket as he went along.</p>

                  </hi>. Prisoner is my son. He was always on friendly terms with deceased and her husband. About half-past eight I was passing the "Builder's Arms" when de<lb/>ceased called me in; I went in. My son gave deceased a shil<lb/>ling and said, "Call for a drink for mother and yourself." She did so; the change was 8d. My son said, "Come on, Kate, the change." She said, "You owe me sixpence." He said, "I have only done two days' work this week and that is all I have" She gave him the change. The three men had had some drink, but they were not drunk; they were all behaving quietly to<lb/>gether. We all left there and went into the "Wheatsheaf." There two young women came in, and deceased started nagging</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110041"/>
               <p>her husband about them. We left the house, and the two of them were jangling along the road. My son said, "Stop it, Kate, do stop it," and with that she hit him in the face with her open hand. She said, "You b——well mind your own business. I got one husband, and I don't want to be dictated to by two." He said, "After that I've done with you, Kate," and he and Thomas Larkman walked on. Walter and the deceased walked behind. I followed them. I did not go with them be<lb/>cause deceased was using such bad language. At the corner of Thorn Road my son and Thomas Larkman stopped. Walter came up with deceased, and said, "Kate is all right now; let's go down here and have one more drink." She was crying and keeping on grumbling about the women. We all went into the "Duke of Cambridge." There was more drink called for; I suggested to deceased that she should have lemonade at I thought she had had quite enough to drink. She had lemonade after a little grumbling. There was a piano-organ outside play<lb/>ing. Deceased went out and danced. She was able to dance although she was the worse for drink. She came back and re<lb/>commenced grumbling. My son said, "Are you going to start again, Kate!"She told him to mind his own b——business and said, "You b——well know where to come to when you want to borrow a sixpence." I said to my son, "Give her the sixpence." He did so. and she said, "Now I will spend it," and she called for a drink for herself and for me. Then her husband said, "A glass of ale for me and George." She said, "No; s——you." I saw Walter and my son go outside; they were away not more than two minutes I should guest. When they returned I was sitting with my back to deceased. I heard her call out, "Oh, he has stabbed me." I turned round and saw someone holding her. Thomas Larkman hit my son, the pot<lb/>man came and put the two men out. I saw a knife lying on the floor; it was open; there was blood on it; I picked it up, wiped it on my skirt, closed it up, and kept it in my hand. I recognise the knife produced. My son was taken to the station and I followed; on the way I threw the knife into a garden in Larkhall Lane; I afterwards went with the police and pointed out where I had thrown it.</p>

                  </hi>. I was house surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital on August 25. Deceased was brought to the Accident Ward and I examined her. She was in a collapsed condition. There was a punctured incised wound in her chest on the right side, below the collar-bone, between the first and second ribs. I considered it was imperative to have an operation performed immediately and made the necessary arrangements. I adminis<lb/>tered strychnine and morphia. The wound was about 3 in. deep, one of the arteries beneath the wound was damaged, and there was very much bleeding. The artery was tied and efforts made to stop the bleeding. She died very shortly afterwards. On August 27 a post-mortem examination was made. The body was in quite a healthy condition. The wound was one that might have been caused by the knife produced. The wound was slightly downwards and backwards; not much force would necessarily have been employed in striking the blow. The cause of death was collapse due to the haemorrhage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The damage to the artery may have been due to the wound, or it may have been the result of the opera<lb/>tion; I cannot say which it was.</p>

                  </hi>, salesman to Messrs. Spink and Son. On September 29, 1905, prisoner came to our establishment in Piccadilly. He wished to see a gold and enamelled box that we had in stock, and wished to take it away to show to people. He mentioned the names of Mr. Van Allen and Mr. Massey-Mainwaring. I allowed him to take the box. The price put upon it was £25, and he was to return it in two or three days. On October 2 he brought it back and asked if he might keep it another two or three days, as he thought he had a customer he could sell it to. I agreed, reducing the price to £24. He then took it away for another three days in order to show it to this gentleman. He did not return it, and I did not see it again until it was produced at Marlborough Street. I gave him an "appro" note, of which I have the counterfoil.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I wrote out the "appro" note under Mr. Charles Spink's directions. I am not aware that after prisoner had the snuff box he went back to my employers' premises three times. I know both Mr. Massey-Mainwaring and Mr. Van Allen by name, and prisoner was not to show it to anyone else. It was a valuable box, and we did not want to show it all over the trade, but if prisoner had sold it privately to anyone else and we had got our money we should not have minded whom it was sold to. I do not know that any commission was then owing to prisoner. I believe we have had business with Mr. Massey-Mainwaring. I do not know that prisoner was entrusted by Mr. Massey-Mainwaring with some valuable bronzes. I know that on November 15 prisoner received from Mr. Colnaghi a cheque (produced) for £25 10s. for the snuff box. I became aware that prisoner had had this money, and had not accounted for it in June last at Marlborough Street Police Court. In the meantime we made no attempt to recovery the box or the money; we had no idea the box was sold. I wrote to him at 103, Judd Street, on October 11, and told him to return the box not to sell it To that letter I got no answer. prisoner might have gone round to see Mr. Charles Spink without me knowing it. Mr. Spink only comes occasionally to his place of business.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The members of the firm take it in turns to attend. It is customary for a gentleman who has a transaction in hand to see It through. prisoner did not call after October 11 to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. The matter was first brought to my notice in December, 1905, or January, 1906.

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have lived at 103, Judd Street for six or seven years and am there now. The first I heard of this charge was at the end of May or begin<lb/>ning of June of this year. I agree that it was in Sep<lb/>tember I got the snuff box; that was the first onset. Before September 29 I had had extensive dealings with Spinks. I had had valuable goods out from them to sell, but had not been able to sell, as their price was too high. Twelve months before September 29, 1905, I had had certain negotiations with Spinks on behalf of Mr. Massey-Mainwaring, on whose behalf I moved certain articles of vertu to their place, viz., a bronze statue of Silvanus and two marble busts. I had an interest in those as I was to get something out of them when they were sold. At the time I received Colnaghi's cheque for the snuff box Spinks was indebted to me, as they had bought my interest in Mr. Massey-Mainwaring's good: The receipt for the goods made out by Mr. Knight, Messrs. Spinks's manager, was dated 27-9-05, and headed, "Messrs. Spink and Son, Limited, in ac<lb/>count with Messrs. Massey-Mainwaring and Allery, 103, Judd Street and 38, Grosvenor Place." A cheque for £150 was handed me with this receipt, which I returned to Mr. Charles</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110046"/>
               <p>Spink at the end of a fortnight as I was unable to see Mr. Massey-Mainwaring. Afterwards I received from Spinks a cheque for £100 for the articles, which I forwarded to Mr. Massey-Mainwaring, with the following letter: "Dear Sir,—You instructed me to do the best I could with the bronze figure and the two marble busts. I have done so with Mr. Charles Spink, selling them to him under your instructions for the sum of £100 (one hundred pounds). I await your reply." I considered that Spinks owed me £50 commission on the sale, and, if the sale had been effected at £150, Spinks would have had to hand me £18, the balance between that sum and £50 being repre<lb/>sented by the value of the snuff box and two other articles—a gold ring and a miniature.</p>
               <p>The Recorder observed that it was clear that if a man was entrusted with a gold snuff box for sale and appropriated it to hit own use he was guilty of felony. The property in the snuff box remained with the Messrs. Spink.</p>
               <p>Mr. Huntly Jenkins. It then becomes a question what his intention was prisoner thought Messrs. Spinks owed him money.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. At present there is no particle of evidence that they owed him a farthing. Mr. Massey-Main waring ought to be here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Huntly Jenkins. He is.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. is Mr. Spink here? Let the whole firm be lent for.</p>
               <p>prisoner. Mr. Charles Spink and Mr. Knight were both pre<lb/>sent when we agreed the settlement. I reckon Spinks owe me £18 now, and did so on September 29,1905. The gold ring and miniature I entrusted to a dealer named Fisher to dispose of and he pawned them. Spinks agreed to allow me £50 on the sale of the bronze and busts. Mr. Massey-Mainwaring did not agree to accept the £100. Mr. Charles Spink had a customer who was willing to give £500 for the bronze, and I was to get my £50 out of the resale of the bronze. £150 was to go to Mr. Massey-Main<lb/>waring and £50 was to come to me, so that Spinks were to make £300 out of it.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. A very nice deal. Did Mr. Massey-Main<lb/>waring know that you were to get £50 out of the deal and Spinks were to get £300, white he was only to get £150?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He knows it now. He was not party to that arrangement. The intending purchaser did not come up to the scratch and pay the £500. He did not like to be a party to the transaction. Did your conscience smite you about this, too?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It did, and I wrote to Mr. Massey-Mainwaring to tell him about it and the transaction fell through. I thought at the time that Spinks owed me £50.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110047"/>
               <p>Examination continued. After the transaction with Col<lb/>naghi I went to Spinkss and we spoke about the £50. I told him I had sold the snuff box to Mr. Colnaghi. I had not the money, but I did not tell Mr. Spink so then as I did not like to let him know. Two days later I told him I had been robbed of the money. I did not tell him how much I had sold the box for at he got cross and went away. Then he instructed Mr. Knight to write the £100 document, taking £50 off. When I wrote to Mr. Massey-Mainwaring he at once gave me an order to come up and get the goods from Spinks.</p>
               <p>The Recorder said it appeared that Mr. Massey-Mainwaring was to be swindled out of £50 in order that Spinks might get back their £32, and prisoner, for no reason that he could dis<lb/>cover, was to get £18. If that was so, a more fraudulent tran<lb/>saction had never been disclosed in a court of justice.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I replied to the letter of October 11 asking me to return the enamelled box to Mr. Charles Spink, saying that as he had arranged that I should take £50 out of the deal I thought the transaction was ended, because of the snuff box and other things. Mr. Spink said I should have the £50 as soon as ever they had done the deal. I applied for it three or four times. I hoped the deal would come off quick. It was under<lb/>stood that I was to get the money out of the sale of the bronze. Rookwood was not present when that arrangement was come to; Mr. Charles Spink and myself did our talking upstairs, and the transaction as to the snuff box took place with him, not with Rookwood. I do not keep any books. On October 13 I had a friendly letter from Mr. Knight with reference to the return of the goods. On November 9 I received a peremptory letter to return the goods forthwith. Notwithstanding that I sold them. On November 16 Spinks telegraphed: "Massey-Main<lb/>waring repudiates the whole transaction. Demand return of all goods to-day. Most necessary you should call." It appears from the letters that Spinks were very anxious to get their goods back, but as they had arranged if the things had been sold for £500 to pay me I thought I would keep them to that. I told Sergeant Barton that I was drunk and lost the money, and that was all the answer I made. I told Mr. Spink on the 17th that I had lost the money, and then he gave me this docu<lb/>ment taking off £50, and so paying himself. I told Mr. Spink on November 15 I thought I could sell the snuff box; as a matter of fact, I had sold it then.</p>

We had the things for more than a year, I think. They were left with us by Mr. Allery, and we found out afterwards he had no right to leave them with us. They remained until removed by Mr. Massey-Mainwaring. That was at the end of 1905 or begin<lb/>ning of 1906. The price at which they were to be sold was entered in our books, and was altered from time to time. As to prisoner's statement that the price of the snuff box, the ring, and the miniature were to be set off against the amount of his commission, not one word of that is true. There is no truth in the statement that the price of the bronze and busts was re<lb/>duced from £150 to £100, so that we could pay ourselves back for the loss of the snuff box and other articles. We never arranged to give him £18, the balance of his commission. He never told me he had sold the things himself, and, I believe, I saw nothing of him after the letter of October 11, requesting him to bring the things back. The matter was mentioned to the police in December. I was not told before that time by pri<lb/>soner that he had sold the goods to Colnaghi and that he had lost the money when he was drank.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We had the goods in our show-rooms for over a year. I am certain we did not have any communication with Mr. Massey-Mainwaring about the bronzes.</p>
               <p>The Recorder expressed the opinion that witness should have been properly represented by counsel at the police court, as this seemed to be a very important matter. As it was, this court had to arrive at the facts in the best way it could.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">WITNESS</hi>. I think I saw Mr. Massey-Mainwaring for the first time two or three years ago at his own house, and I have seen him in our place once when he called. He told us on that occasion that we had no authority to sell then. I think I am correct in saying we never wrote to him. A reserve price was fixed, and we should pay ourselves by commission. The value of these goods varies a great deal. I think the lowest price we had from prisoner was about £150, but at first I think some<lb/>thing like £2,000 was put upon them, but we found that that was quite an exorbitant price, as they hadn't fetched anything like that at the sale where they were bought. Some dealer was the purchaser. As to what would be a fair market value for these things, I do not think that in a forced sale they would fetch £150, but a special man who wanted such articles might give £500 for them. If they were taken to Christie's and sold at a good sale they would no doubt fetch more than if they were sold as a miscellaneous lot. I believe the price put upon them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110049"/>
               <p>was £2,080, but they were reduced soon afterwards to about £500. Then it came down to £150 and then to £100. The thing was done when I was away. I should not myself have thought of having them brought into our place at such an absurd price. When I wrote the cheque for £100 I supposed prisoner had authority to tell at that price. The cheque was returned by Mr. Massey-Mainwaring and the goods taken away. We received a telegram purporting to come from Mr. Master-Mainwaring saying that he would accept the £100, but Mr. Massey-Mainwaring says he never sent it, and we believe it to have been false. We had had a large number of small dealings with Allery before. Whenever he sold anything for us we just gave him what we reckoned it should be without any agreement. He made his own commission, and if he asked a reasonable amount we should give it certainly. There was no settlement with Mr. Massey-Mainwaring; he simply came and demanded his goods, and we gave them back. Beyond making a com<lb/>plaint at Vine Street, we did not take any criminal proceedings. We let the matter drop until we were informed prisoner was in custody on another charge in May of this year. We do not like prosecutions. I do not think there was much kindness in our not proceeding against him; it takes up too much time. I had nothing to do with the fixing of the price.</p>
               <p>----<hi rend="smallCaps">KNIGHT</hi> (salesman to Spink and Sons). The goods were deposited some time in 1904. They were brought by Stevens and Sons, monumental masons. Allery appeared just at the time when the goods were arriving, and represented him<lb/>self as the agent of Mr. Massey-Mainwaring and we accepted his statement. In October, 1905, the reserve price was agreed at £150. In November we telegraphed prisoner that Mr. Massey-Mainwaring repudiated the whole transaction. As to how it came about that we offered to buy them for £100, we heard that they were bought at an auction sale, and that he had purchased them really at a very low rate indeed, and we felt justified in reducing our offer for the goods. prisoner stated that he had a free hand. A cheque for £100 was handed to Allery. There were three cheques written, because he posed at one time simply as the agent, and then afterwards he stated that he had a part right to the goods—that was to say, he was a partner, so we made out the cheques on both understandings. All the cheques were handed back to us. One cheque for £150 was made out in his own name and Mr. Massey-Mainwaring's name and the other in Mr. Massey-Maiinwaring's name only. One cheque was withdrawn at the request of Allery in order to facilitate his business transaction. Both cheques had to bear the endorsement of Mr. Massey-Mainwaring. I do not recall what took place when we informed prisoner that Mr. Massey-Mainwaring had telegraphed and repudiated the transaction.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110050"/>
               <p>We were very much astonished that prisoner should be dispos<lb/>ing of property he was not entitled to dispose of. I never asked him about the snuff box because it was not in the depart<lb/>ment with which I am connected.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I made out the cheque I thought that Allery was a bona-fide agent of Mr. Massey-Mainwaring, and had authority to name the price for the goods. We found out afterwards that he had no such authority. If the sale had come off prisoner would have had £50. I honestly thought he had an interest in the things, and we have his statement in writing to that effect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Huntly Jenkins. If you honestly thought that he had this interest why did not you only give one cheque and let him square up with his partner afterwards?</p>
               <p>Witness. It was done at prisoner's own request. We began then to think there was something suspicious about it.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. Supposing that £100 cheque payable to Mr. Massey-Mainwaring had been accepted by him and cashed, the goods would have been your property?</p>
               <p>Witness. Quite so. If we had gold the goods as agent pri<lb/>soner would naturally have received a commission. If we had bought them at a low price his commission would not have beta necessarily bigger. A commission would have been paid him by the firm had the £100 cheque been accepted. It would have been entirely governed by circumstances. I would not gay when I wrote the letter of October 30 I thought he was dishonestly withholding the goods. If we had owed him £50 the difference Between that sum and the value of the snuff box, the ring, and the miniature, £32, would have been £18, but there was nothing owing. If Mr. Massey-Mainwaring had accepted the £150 cheque prisoner would have got his £50 out of him. I believe Mr. Massey-Mainwaring is a customer of the firm. I would not go so far as to say there was not a cheque for £50 made out to prisoner, because I am not sufficiently clear as to counting-house matters.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. After sending prisoner the telegram that Mr. Massey-Mainwaring repudiated the transaction, we broke off negotiations with him. He could not claim commission after that; the transaction was completely at an end.</p>

                  </hi>. In 1904, when I be<lb/>came possessor of the bronze figure of Silvanus, which was of heroic size, and the marble busts, prisoner came to me and said that Messrs. Spink and Sons were making an exhibition in their new premises of sixteenth and seventeenth century art and would I mind lending them the bronze, etc. I then instructed Messrs Amor, of St. James's Street, who were taking care of the things for me to deliver them to Messrs. Spink. Prisoner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110051"/>
               <p>came to me afterwards, and asked me if I would sell them I assented, and put the price of £2,060 on the bronze and £500 on the marble busts. prisoner had no interest whatever in the things, and I had not agreed to pay him a commission if he sold them. In March, 1905, Allery told me Messrs. Spink thought they could get £500 for the bronze, and I said I would not take anything like that; I would have £2,000 or nothing. I never authorised him to agree to sell the things for £150. I repudiated the arrangement as soon as it came to my know<lb/>ledge, and demanded the return of the goods. I told Spink's messenger who called upon me about it to tell his employers that a swindle was being perpetrated upon them. I repudiated the sale in November. When I was in Ireland I got a cheque from Messrs. Spink for £100. I was very angry, but I did not write, as I was returning to England the next day. I took the letter to my solicitor, who afterwards called upon Messrs. Spink. Messrs. Spink at first would not give the things up, and said they had bought them off Allery for £100, and in<lb/>tended to keep them, but after some trouble I got them back. I gave the cheque to my solicitor to return, and he did so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The bronze was very valuable. I agree that they were left with Spinks' for the purpose of sale, but I expected to get my price and did not intend to reduce it. I did not communicate with Spinks' at all before November, 1905, when their young man called upon me.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I never authorised the sale of these things for any such price as £100 or £150.</p>

               <p>Prisoner was further indicted for stealing a piece of tapestry, the goods of Samuel Dockerell; and that having been entrusted by William F.B. Massey-Mainwaring with a piece of tapestry, he did fraudulently convert the said property and the proceeds thereof to his own use and benefit.</p>
               <p>Mr. Symmons prosecuted.</p>
               <p>The Recorder said if the indictment was to be proceeded with he must send the case for trial before another judge, and deal with the former case on its merits, as it would not be fair to the prisoner for him to hear the circumstances of the other case, which must necessarily influence his mind in passing sentence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Symmons said that where there was a second indictment it was often taken as showing that a transaction was not isolated. The amount involved in the second charge was £200. The tapestry was entrusted to the prisoner on March 10, 1905, by Mr. Massey-Mainwaring to show to a Mr. Van Allen. For months the prosecutor was told that Mr. Van Allen had not made up his mind, and ultimately it was found that the tapestry had been disposed of to a firm dealing in such things for £175, prisoner receiving £150.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110052"/>
               <p>It was decided not to proceed with the tapestry case.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">ALBERT BURTON</hi>, recalled as to prisoner's antece<lb/>dents, said he had borne a very good character up to 1895, and had made a living as a dealer, but on April 9 in that year be was convicted at the Cumberland County Sessions of obtaining goods by means of worthless bank notes. In April, 1896, he was convicted at the Ediniboro Sheriff's Court of obtaining goods by false pretences, and since then he had been obtaining a living by this commission business.</p>

                  </hi>, fancy jeweller, 82, High Road, Balham. At 7.30 on August 13 communications were made to me, and I came downstairs. My wife called my attention to plants being removed in the window in the conservatory. I went outside and found a small centre bit underneath the win<lb/>dow in the conservatory. I had a look round the shop, and I called a sergeant in, and I told him. At 20 minutes to 11 a clerk from the bank called and said there was a cheque presented. Then I found the cheque had gone and £14 18s. The blank cheque corresponding to the number of the counter, foil was brought back by the clerk of the bank, and it had been filled in for £175 10s. It was on a cheque form taken out of the middle of the book. The counterfoil was gone, and I have never seen it since. The window in the kitchen opened into the conservatory, and prisoners had got in through the kitchen window from the conservatory. I saw the window fastened over night. In the morning I could not say whether the window was fastened or not. Cook was in my employ three years ago, and he knew these premises.</p>

                  </hi>, 24, Brock well Road, Brixton. I am 15 years of age. I was scoring at a cricket match at Brockwell Park, and in that match prisoners Findlay and Kemp were playing. It was a knock-up game. Percy Kemp told me he earned plenty of money in "busting"—afterwards he ex<lb/>plained that it meant bursting into houses—and wished to know if I would like to go into it. I said I would. He said it was better than scrumping apples—that is stealing apples from gardens—and he told me to meet him that evening. I met Kemp at the Brixton Road, outside the "Prince of Wales," on the Monday, and we went to the Balham Road. It was mid<lb/>night, and as we were going to open a gate a dog barked, and We postponed the operation. On the Tuesday we went there together, Kemp and Cook and myself, at 11 o'clock. We went into an empty house next door. We all three went downstairs into the cellar. They waited in the passage, and we came out, and Cook said we had better not enter now, and we could come tomorrow night and do it properly. He told me to bring</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110055"/>
               <p>a brace and bit to Brockwell Park next afternoon. Kemp told me to bring the bit. Cook did not speak on the subject. Kemp and I went to Mordaunt Street, where Cook lives, and Cook said we had not got the proper tools. He meant a knife and chisel and centre bit. I went home at 12 o'clock that night. We all came away together. Next afternoon I met Kemp and Cook in Brockwell Park, and I brought the brace and this bit. I had taken some tools belonging to my father. They told me to meet them in Abberville Road on Wednesday evening at 9.30. I met Kemp at eight o'clock, and we went to the Free Library until nine. Then we came across and met Findlay; Cook was not there. I knew Findlay before. I met him just outside the library, and he said he would meet us at the corner of the Geneva Road at seven o'clock in the morning. I and Kemp went to Eastland's shop in Balham. We went to the rear of the premises and got into the empty shop next door. Mr. Eastland came into the kitchen, and we waited another three-quarters of an hour, and then the lights were put out, and they went to bed. Kemp got over the wall and opened the conservatory door and got into the place. He told me to hide a lighted candle under my coat. Then he got the cash-bag off the shelf, and he took some money out. He put the cheque-book in his pocket with a used cheque and looked into the pass-book. He went into the next door cellar and counted the money, and said he had got £6. He told me to go to the bottom of the yard. I called him down, and we went to Clapham Common, then we went to the coffee stall at Station Road till seven o'clock, then we joined Findlay and went to Brockwell Park. Kemp gave the two cheques to Find lay and told-him to meet them at Mordaunt Street, Cock's place. In the park, when kemp gave the cheques, Kemp's brother, Fred., and Findlay were there, and Findlay took the cheques. Cook was not there. Kemp gave me two sovereigns and told me to buy a suit of clothes. Findlay came into the room and told me to go out. Then he called Cook in. This was in Cook's house. 22, Mordaunt Street. Findlay and Kemp were there. Findlay told me to go into a room. About a quarter of an hour afterwards Findlay came in with a wet cheque in his hand, and he got blotting-paper and dried it. Then he wrote out a slip of paper with figures on it, and they took me to the bank at ten minutes past ten. Findlay wrote on a piece of paper so many £10 notes, and so many £5 notes, and so much in cash. T do not know whether Cook wrote any<lb/>thing. I saw Findlay write the paper [produced] I got some clothes and Cook told me to put them on. It is the suit I have on now. Kemp took one of the sovereigns back. I and Find<lb/>lay went to the bank. Kemp and Cook followed behind. I went in by myself. Findlay stopped outside and Kemp and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110056"/>
               <p>Cook were across the road. I went in and presented the cheque and payment was refused. A clerk went to Mr. Eastland, and I waited. The manager took me over to Eastland's shop and then we went to a police station. Then a man in private clothes came in.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. When I came out of the bank I did not see the three men—they had gone. I was in the bank a quarter of an hour, hut I did not see them again. I was origi<lb/>nally given into charge and dismissed by the magistrates.</p>
               <p>To Findlay. You said when we were going to the bank, "Where are the others?" They passed by on the tram and you said, "We had better go into the 'George," and you paid for a drink. You asked me at the police court if at any of these meetings either at Brockwell Park or anywhere else I heard you mention the burglary or a cheque, and I said no.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. That is the cheque I presented [produced]. I saw Findlay write the slip of paper. It was wet when he came out and I saw him blot it. The slip is in his handwriting. To Findlay. I saw you write that down. It was on a long slip, and Cook tore it in half. I did not see you forge the cheque.</p>
               <p>To Kemp. I remember being at Epworth Road and you saw me getting over a wall to steal some plums on the Monday after<lb/>noon. That was the first time this was spoken about to me. You spoke to me about it in the park.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. When I was trying to get over the wall to steal the plums was on the Monday, after cricket was over. He had spoken to me before that.</p>
               <p>To Kemp. On the Monday you spoke to me in Epworth Road. You asked me for the brace and bit. You said, "I cannot do this unless I have a brace and bit." You said, "Bring them up to Brockwell Park to-morrow afternoon." I said I had one. I have never been in the hands of the police before. I saw the bag and I said, "There is a bag," and you went and took it. You were going into the shop first. You wanted the cheque.</p>
               <p>To Cook. One of you tore the slip of paper. I cannot tell which it was. I know it was Kemp or Cook. Findlay wrote out the paper and one tore it. I do not know which.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. The night that I got into Eastland's house Kemp was there; Cook was not. Cook did not go to the burglary.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective, B Division. The burglary was on Wednesday night. On Friday, at two a.m., I went to 81, Geneva Road, the address of Findlay. Findlay came and opened the door. I told him I was an officer and wanted to speak to him upstairs. I cautioned him, and he said he knew Bretherton and Cook and Kemp. I said, "I believe you met Bretherton at the bottom of your road this morning and also</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110057"/>
               <p>later?" He assented. I said, "I believe you hands him a cheque and a note," which he denied. I told him I should take him into custody for Being concerned with Bretherton in forging and uttering a cheque for £175 10s. He said, "I do not know anything at all about it." On the way to the station he said, "Where are we going to Balham?" I said, "No, Brixton for a short time." On arriving at Wandsworth Common Police Station Bretherton was brought from the cell, and the inspector on duty asked Bretherton whether he knew Findlay, and Brether<lb/>ton replied he did, and I then read the statement to Findlay which Bretherton had made. He said, "I plead not guilty to the forgery. I was there, but I would not have anything to do with it."</p>
               <p>To Findlay. You hesitated over the name Harry Bretherton. I took two pieces of paper out of your pocket, and asked you if they were in your handwriting.</p>

Kemp said it had nothing to do with him, and I conveyed him to Brixton police station where he was detained, and subsequently he said, "I will plead guilty to the burglary but not to the forgery.

                  </hi>, Inspector, W Division. I have made in<lb/>quiries with regard to all the prisoners. It is safe to say that they have not done any work for the last two or three years. Findlay was discharged from prison after 15 months' hard labour in October, 1905. There were a number of cases against him. his parents are respectable, and they have done every<lb/>thing in their power to get him to go straight. They have gone without themselves to dress him. The forgery was a clever one, as the cheque was stolen from the centre of the book. They dressed Bretherton out in a new suit of clothes to give him a good appearance. With regard to Cook, he was three years ago in the employ of Mr. Eastland, and it was from him that the information was obtained. Cook has done no work at all for three years. Six months after he left Eastland's he broke into a house of some friends, but was not prosecuted. With regard to Kemp, since his conviction last year he has done no work. I should say he has applied to the police officer who arrested him to get some employment, but they all three belong to a gang which style themselves the "Never?"—that is they never work. They spend their time in playing cricket and football. Cases of burglary have been common in the vicinity of Brixton, but since their arrest they have ceased, and they are respon<lb/>sible for a great number of those offences.</p>
               <p>Findlay. I was not charged with forgery before; I was charged with uttering the cheque knowing it was forged. As far as "Nevers" go, I had nothing to do with the "Never" Club. If Bretherton is one of the "Nevers," I did not know it by the name of "The Nevers." I have known him by the name of "Nobbier." Cook I have known two or three years. I have been in the habit of visiting his home every morning.</p>
               <p>Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">EBBAGE</hi> stated that after he came out of prison on the last occasion Kemp came to him and he tried to get him work, but his conviction stood in the way. He is partly kept by his friends. Cook will not work. Findlay could get work, but will not work. He prefers to play cricket his parents say he will not work.</p>

                  </hi>. I am 25 years of age; my parents live at Uxbridge. In February, 1902, I was appren<lb/>ticed to James Sweet, of Whetstone, near Barnet, a horticul<lb/>turist. Prisoner was one of Sweet's foremen; in the same employment there was a man named George Close. I had reason to complain of Close's conduct, and told him I should have to report him. About March or April, 1902, Close left. Afterwards I had frequent meeting with Close in the morning and in the evening; then Close commenced demanding money of me. Later in April prisoner spoke to me; he said that Clow had gone to America, And had died on his way out, and that just before his death he had sent for the captain and doctor of the snip, and stated that I had acted improperly with him, and had given him sweets containing poison. I told prisoner it was a pack of lies, and asked him if it could be proved. He said not a word, but if I did not give him money to leave Eng<lb/>land he would prove it all. In consequence of what he said I gave him £3. On July 4 he spoke to me again; he said that the ship bad returned from America, that letters given by Close to the captain and doctor had been sent to prisoner's father by them, and that he must go down to his father in the Isle of Wight to see the letters. I gave him £3. He went away and returned in a day or two. He said he had seen his father, and that when his father was out of the room he had taken the letters and burnt them, but that if I did not give him £3 to leave England he would prove the contents of the letters. I gave him about £3. He was again absent from work, and returned on July 12. He said he had been had up by his father for stealing the letters, and had been taken to Highgate and sentenced to seven days' imprisonment. He asked for more money, and said that if I did not give it him he would ruin me and my family; he would swear to the contents of Close's letters. On July 15 I handed him another £3. Seven days later be came and told me he was charged at St. Albans with stealing the letters, and must have a solicitor to defend him. I asked him if he knew one; he said he knew a man named Dunn at Brighton, and he would want £17 to conduct the defence, and if he (prisoner) did not get it he would ruin me. I gave him £15. A fortnight later he returned and said he had been in prison at St. Albans for 14 days for stealing the letters. After this I saw him practically every day, and periodically he asked me for money, using the same threats. This went on down to May, 1905. Sometimes the threats were verbal, sometimes he wrote me letters; these I burnt. Some</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110063"/>
               <p>of the payments I made were by portal orders registered to the prisoner's address. In May, 1905, I left Whetstone and re<lb/>turned home, and then he commenced writing to me; between that date and June, 1906, I sent him) various sums. In July, 1906, I had a letter from him which I showed to my parental and to my solicitor. On July 28 I was at home with my solicitor and two police officers. Prisoner home, and I saw him in the billiard room, the two officers being in the lavatory adjoining. I asked prisoner what he wanted; he said, "I must have £60 to-night to give to the girl whose young man you have poisoned, or you must marry her and bring her home and intro<lb/>duce her to your family as their daughter-in-law and your wife," and that if I did not she and his father would have me arrested at eight o'clock that evening. I told him I had not got the money; he said, "Then it's all of with you." He said the young woman would go to his father that night, and would then telephone through to the Uxbridge Police Station, and have me Arrested. He stated that the young woman had gone to the nursery (Sweet's) the day before, and had bribed three men to prove anything she liked to ask. I then walked towards the window, and the two officers came into the room. I charged prisoner with demanding £60 with threats. He jumped up and said, "Mr. Dobell, do forgive me; for God's sake do forgive me." He was arrested. I afterwards charged him with threatening to accuse me of an infamous crime.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I cannot say how long it was after I first knew you that I sent you to my tailors to get measured for a suit of clothes. I did that because while I was in ill-health you had done work that was supposed to be mine, and I never take work from a subordinate without paying for it. I did not ask you to my rooms night after night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Bucknill pointed out to the prisoner that he was not charged with obtaining money from the witness by threa's relating to misconduct between him and the prisoner; and warned prisoner of the danger to himself of introducing "col<lb/>lateral" matter. Prisoner then handed in a written statement. Having read it, his lordship said that it contained nothing what<lb/>ever having any bearing on the present charge. This he ex<lb/>plained fully to prisoner. Prisoner said that, with the excep<lb/>tion of the £60 payment, his case was an absolute denial of prosecutor's statements that he made these threats.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination continued. When you asked me for the £60 you did not say you wanted it for one of your old sweet<lb/>hearts. I never went to a dance in North Finchley with you I did not write and ask you to burn ray letters three days before you were arrested. You did not tell me that you wanted this £60 to get married, and that you had lost all your money through horse-racing. I did not tell you that my uncle had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110064"/>
               <p>died and left me some money; I have not had an uncle die for many years. I did not tell you when I left Whetstone that I was going to prepare for the Church nor that when I had en<lb/>tered the Church you could come and live with me. It is false that I went to town very often with you to theatres and music-halls; I never went to a theatre once while I was in the north. I did not go with you to the Oxford; I was never with you at Daly's Theatre. (Prisoner put certain questions about a painter at Whetstone, and witness absolutely denied the sug<lb/>gestion made.)</p>

I confirm pro<lb/>secutor's account of the interview with prisoner in the billiard-room at Uxbridge on July 28, from what I overheard when secreted in the adjoining lavatory. When I came into the room I said to prisoner, "I am a police officer, and have heard you demand with threats money from Mr. Dobell." He turned to prosecutor and said, "My God, Mr. Dobell, forgive me" When the charge was read over to prisoner at the station he made no reply. As he was being removed to the cells he turned to prosecutor and said, "Mr. Dobell, you know what you did to me in your rooms." In the cells he asked for writing mate<lb/>rials, and wrote the two letters produced. I detained them, as they contain a suggestion of another offence. On afterwards being charged with threatening to accuse prosecutor of an abominable crime, prisoner made no reply.</p>

On the night of August 10 Mrs. Pentland spoke to him outside the music-hall, and he subsequently went with her to her house, into a room in which there was a bed. While they were there prisoner came from under the bed and said, "What's this game?" I'm going to have your life." fie unsheathed a long, curved Oriental dagger and held it over witness. He made witness write at his dictation, "I hereby swear that I have misbehaved myself with Mrs. Pentland indecently when I had no right to "; he then demanded from witness his watch and chain and whatever money he had on him; witness, under terror of the dagger, gave him the Watch and chain and half a crown. Witness did not know when he went with the woman that she was married.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Prisoner: It was the woman who pro<lb/>posed that we should go to the house. I have twice mis<lb/>behaved myself with her.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective, K Division. I arrested prisoner on August 13. On my reading the warrant to him he said, "I expected so much; I admit I done wrong in taking the law in my own hands; I have seen a solicitor, and have handed him the watch and chain; I have spent the money." Later I saw Mr. Lovibond at Stratford, and went with him to a pawn<lb/>shop; he redeemed the watch and chain and banded them to me. Mrs. Pentland, in prisoner's presence, said that she had lived with him three years before they were married.</p>

He totally denied his wife's allegation that he had directed her to go on the streets or to entrap this prosecutor. When he married her he knew that she had been a prostitute; he loved her, and thought he could induce her to lead a respectable married life with him. She always had the bulk of his earnings. On returning from different voyages he heard accounts of her misconducting herself in his absence, and he resolved to watch her. On the night in question he was watching her and saw her return home with the prosecutor. He was not under the bed. He entered the room and told the prosecutor he must sign the paper and give him his watch and chain as evidence, as he intended to take divorce proceedings. The next day he consulted Mr. Lovibond on the subject of divorce proceedings, and handed him the watch and chain as evidence. Verdict,

                  </hi>. Medical Officer at Holloway Gaol. Prisoner had been under my care since August 9. I consider she is sane and capable of understanding the nature of the charge. In my opinion her throwing herself down, scream<lb/>ing, and refusing to plead is not a genuine illness, but a pre<lb/>tence.</p>
               <p>The Recorder. Under those circumstances I must direct that the trial take place in her absence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Godwin. There is a passage in Stephen's Digest to the effect that, if a prisoner so misconducts himself or herself as to mate it impossible to try him or her with decency, the court may order the prisoner to be removed, and proceed in his or her absence. The case cited for that is one before Mr. Justice Will, Regina, v. Berry (104 L.T.J., 100). That a violent and noisy prisoner was ordered to be removed, and he was sen<lb/>tenced in his absence. I am informed by the officer of the court (Mr. Bead), who has had great experience, extending over a number of yeas, that there is a similar case before the late Lord Blackburn, where the prisoner was so violent and created such a disturbance that it was impossible to proceed with the trial, and the learned judge, satisfied that it was intentional, directed him to be removed and that the trial should proceed.</p>
               <p>Dr. Fullarton also stated that prisoner did not act in this way at any other time, but was quiet and peaceable in prison.</p>

               <p>The Recorder said that was rather a curious matter, and in all his experience, extending over 34 year, he did not remem<lb/>ber such a thing happening, and it was necessary proceed with very great care in investigating the evidence. It had always been the rule that if a prisoner when celled upon refused to plead the Judge might direct a plea of not guilty to be entered, but it was very seldom that the conduct of a prisoner was of such a character that the trial could not take place in his or her pretence. It had, of course, been necessary to satisfy himself that she was in such a state of mind as to be capable of understanding the proceedings and pleading to the indictment by the evidence of the medical gentleman under whose careful observation she had been, and had that not been the case he would have directed her to be confined during His Majesty's pleasure.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-Sergeant, New Scotland Yard. From information received I and Detective Gillard kept observation upon 5, Warren Street, Tottenham Court Road, from five p.m. on August 31 until 7.20 a.m. on September 1. I then saw the two prisoners approach the house, 5, Warren Street. They stood looking around for a minute, and Robert opened the pre<lb/>mises and entered with Chavin, who closed the door. Ten minutes afterwards the two prisoners left the premises. I arrested Chavin, Robert being arrested by Gillard. They were taken to the station. On searching Chavin I found a purse which I took from his right-hand trousers pocket, containing £1 in gold in one compartment, seven shillings and a penny in another compartment, good money, and in a third compart<lb/>ment three shillings base metal. They were dated 1894, 1896, and 1900 respectively. I drew the prisoner's attention to these coins; evidently they did not understand me, and made no reply. Subsequently I, Inspector Sexton, Sergeant Yeo, and P.C. Gillard went back to the premises, and I helped to take possession of a large quantity of coining implements, moulds, etc. The battery, chemicals, and tools were all lying about on the bench, and could be seen by anyone who entered the pre<lb/>mises. I should say coining had been going on quite recently judging from the state of the floor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Robert carried a parcel which we found containing clean linen. I saw nothing of a parcel carried by Chavin, but he might have had one.</p>

               <p>front door of 5, Warren Street, another the key of the work<lb/>shop in the basement, where the coining plant was found, and another of a back room adjoining the workshop, the fourth is probably his private latch key. I used those keys to get in. Chavin was carrying a parcel which might have contained books. We found a parcel inside which was untied, and ap<lb/>parently had contained linen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. There was abundant evidence of coining; a battery on the left-hand side of the room, on the floor a piece of metal; scattered about were piece of plaster of paris as if moulds had been broken; on a bench in front of the window were scrubbing brushes, boards, pieces of emery paper, and broken pieces of white metal. In the oven was a large crucible containing about 20 lb. of white metal melted down. At the side was about 10 lb. of metal. I should say anyone would have seen them if he had gone in for a few minutes. There were splashes of plaster of paris all about and splashes of metal on the grate.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-Sergeant, New Scotland Yard. On September 1 I went with Inspector Sexton, Inspector Parsons, Sergeant Story, and P.C. Gillard to 5, Warren Street. We entered with keys taken from Robert. On the left-hand side of the workshop we found a large bench fixed with a number of shelves on the side and on the wall. Behind the bench I found six zinc patterns for moulds, showing signs of recent use, a box containing 36 two-franc pieces, a small cardboard box con<lb/>taining 36 two franc pieces, and 56 five franc piece, false Belgian money. Some were wrapped in packet of five with paper be<lb/>tween the coins; and 40 five-franc pieces, false French money. On the top of the bench a tin mustard box, containing 70 coun<lb/>terfeit shillings, and a small iron saucepan. On the bench were 17 counterfeit florins, 12 bottles containing various fluids and acid used for coining, a large glass chemical gauge, a plating rack used for putting the coins into the plating bath, a ladle for pouring metal into moulds with metal inside and a quantity of tin, copper, and insulating wire, two wooden troughs used for pouring the plaster of paris in and making the mould shape, and a wooden hand clamp used for holding the mould shape, a large three-burner paraffin stove full of oil, and having the appearance of having been recently used with soot on it. Under the window was another bench with two vices fixed on it, five files, much used, for opening the moulds, three pairs of pliers, a small hand vice, two metal spoons, with plaster in them, and an enamelled bowl with plaster on it, three ordinary chisels, a screw hammer, a scraper, three tin saucepans, an oil stove, three scouring pans for mixing emery in to scour the coins. On a shelf by the side of the fireplace were six bottles contain<lb/>ing cyanide of potassium and other chemicals, six scrubbing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110072"/>
               <p>brushes, two showing much use, for scouring the coins after coming from the mould. I found six moulds in a box, three for making 5 franc pieces and three for making 2 franc pieces. They seemed quite new and unused. On the left-hand side of the room on a shelf was a large and very powerful battery and two baths full of liquid used for plating. There were a quantity of French books, some in MS., containing different receipts for making chemicals and mixing metals, and some English books. In the oven was a crucible containing 10 lb. to 15 lb. of metal and under the shelf on the left was a large quantity of metal run down, and six scrubbing boards. The room was about nine feet square, and was full of these things and they were all exposed to view. In one corner was a quantity of coal. On the floor were spashes of plaster and metal. The ground floor is a cycle-shop, and the upper rooms are let in tenements. The window of the workshop was coated very thickly with whitewash, quite opaque. There appeared to have been a fire quite recently. The scrubbing boards showed considerable wear.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-inspector, New Scotland Yard. At 8.15 a.m. on September 1 I spoke in French to the prisoners at Tottenham Court Road Police Station. Chavin asked me what he was there for. I replied, "You have been brought here by officers acting under my instructions." He again asked me to tell him what he was brought there for. I said, "You had better wait and I will confront you with the officers, when they will give me in your presence that which was found on your person, and I will then tell you exactly what the charge will be against you." I then went with the other officers to 5, Warren Street, where the articles enumerated by Sergeant Yeo were taken possession of. Later, after searching those pre<lb/>mises, I saw both the prisoners at the police station together and in their presence the two officers, Story and Gillard, handed those things to me. Story handed me a purse which contained three counterfeit shillings and said, "This is what I found in this man's right-hand trousers pocket." I said in French to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110073"/>
               <p>Chavin, "You hear what the officer says, that these three coins were found in your pocket this morning when you were arrested. What do you say about them?" He made no reply. They were then formally charged with being concerned together in having in their possession several counterfeit coins, and further with possessing plant—that is to say, batteries, moulds, etc.—for the manufacture of counterfeit coins, both of this country and France and Belgium. The whole of the articles which we have gone through to-day were before them and all the coins. Robert made no reply. Chavin said, "I earn enough to gain my own living without making false money. I ignore (j'ignore) what my friend does. I am a pastry cook, and have always worked since I have been in this country." I have found that to be quite true, and I believe he was on hit way to work when arrested. Then Robert said, "All I say is that I am alone in the affair. My friend was only going to give me a hand to move. It has been brought on through poverty. I was making the money because I was out of work for the past month. I take all responsibility. The moulds by which I made the English money I broke up. I only made enough to live with. The coins did not turn out very good, so I again melted them down." I asked for their addresses, and Robert said, "Find out; it is for you to find that out. You seem to know a lot up to the present. Find out, it is for you." I then told him "Yes, I know your address," and mentioned it to him, and he said, "That is your business." I knew the address, because Chavin frankly gave me his address. He said, "I live with my friend at No. 12, Regency Street, but not in the same room." I then with Inspector Parsons searched 12, Regency Street, Westminster. In the room occupied by Chavin I took possession of a very large quantity of most inflammatory Anarchist literature, pamphlets, books, etc. I omitted to state that at the police-station Gillard handed me a book showing that Robert is the secretary of the Anarchist Propaganda in London, and showing the names of the members and the amounts collected from them. There is the name of Tombat. His payments cease from the date in January last on which he was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude in this court for counterfeiting and circulating false money. Chavin's name appears there in April this year. He has been only four or five months in this country.</p>

                  </hi>, 12, Regency Street, Westminster. On May 7, 1906, I let to Robert two rooms on the top floor. About June 9 a man named Levigni took the drawing-room floor, and the prisoner Chavin came as a lodger to him. Robert and Chavin lodged in my house until the day of their arrest. Robert usually went out about 7.30 am., came home about 12 to 12.30 to lunch, and returned again about six p.m. Chavin usually went out about 7.30 a.m., I think separately. Neither of them gave notice to leave.</p>
               <p>The case for the Crown being closed, his lordship ruled that there was no evidence against Chavin of the possession of the mould, and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Chavin was then charged with unlawfully having in his possession three counterfeit shillings.</p>

Chavin made no answer to that. I ordered some food to be given to Chavin. He did not at the time say, "These pieces were given to me by Robert on paying me back 5s. which he owed me.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective, City Police. On August 25, 1906, at 3.15 p.m., in company with Detective Dyer, I saw Jones enter "The Grapes public-house carrying a parcel. Two minutes later Dunton entered carrying another parcel. They shortly afterwards left with the parcels. We followed them to South Place, Finsbury, where they were stopped. I said to Jones, "We are police officers. What have you in that parcel?" He said, "Lawn." I said, "Where did you get it from?" He said, "I am going to sell it to the other man," pointing to Dunton, "he knows all about it" I then said to Dunton, "Where does this parcel come from!"Dunton made no reply. We then took them to the station, where Dunton was charged, on his own confession, with stealing the lawn—that is the parcel that Jones was carrying—and also the parcel containing velvet which Dunton was carrying, and four sprays of artificial flowers which were found in Jones's silk hat when he was searched. Jones was charged with receiving the lawn and flowers, well knowing them to have been, stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I found on Dunton six pocket handker<lb/>chiefs, which I have since found were in fact bought by Jones. Jones said that Dunton gave him 1s. 6d. for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the employ of Richard Harman and have pleaded guilty to stealing these goods. On Saturday, September 1, I saw Jones. The previous Saturday he had asked me if I could let him have a spray or two of flowers, and I promised him that I would see him the next day. That ap<lb/>pointment I never kept On September 1, about 3 p.m., I locked up the upper part of our premises and was going down to the basement when Jones came up to the front door and asked me if I could let him have a couple of sprays of flowers. He followed me downstairs into the basement and I gave him</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110076"/>
               <p>the two sprays of flowers produced. He then saw the packet of lawn produced, and said, "I can do with that. I can sell it and we will share the money." I said, "I do not like doing that kind of thing." He said, "Go along, that is all right," and he persuaded me to let him have it. As we went out the evil thought came in my head to take the velvet produced. Jones wrapped up the lawn and I made a parcel of the velvet. Jones left and I locked up the basement and met him at "The Grapes" public-house in Jewin Street. Jones put the artifi<lb/>cial flowers in his silk hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known Jones for some time. He buys stuff and sells it. Seven months ago my father died sud<lb/>denly. He was a dealer in plant decorations, grasses, and palms. Some years ago he used to make flowers. My father had some stock which we had to sell off. Jones assisted me in selling it. I did not tell Jones that the lawn and flowers were part of my father's stock. Jones did not tempt me to steal the velvet. This is the first time I have robbed my employers, except that on three or four occasions I have let Jones have a spray of flowers. I was going to take the velvet home to my wife. Jones gave me six handkerchiefs for the flowers. I sold a van load of stuff from my father's estate to Taylor, of Edmonton, consisting of grasses and ferns and some furniture, for about £10.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have been three and a half years with Messrs. Harman. I previously was with Mr. Fielden and worked for Taylor, of Edmonton, and was in business for my<lb/>self. I was in the House of Commons for eleven years as a messenger.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. I have never met Jones at "The Grapes" before. The value of the flowers is about 2s. The sprays I gave Jones before were not worth as much; they were things which we used for copying and were faded. I had a couple of handkerchiefs worth 43/4 d. each and a pair of socks for them from Jones.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a traveller in artificial flowers and other goods. I have known Dunton about 30 years and knew his father. His father died six months ago, and I had a commission with him about selling his goods, which were the ordinary property of a flower maker who had been in business fifty years. About August 24 he met me where we both go to dinner in Fleet Street, and said, "I shall bring up from home a packet of lawn. It is almost the last of my father's things. I do not know what mother will do when they are all sold." When he left on the Saturday at three p.m. I met him in Aldersgate Street, and he handed me the parcel of lawn. I always met him when he left off or in his dinner</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110077"/>
               <p>hour. He said, "That is the packet of lawn I told you I would bring up." I had suggested he should leave it at Liver-pool Street Station, where he came to. I have never been in Messrs. Harman's place at any time. Dunton told me the price was 3s. 6d., and he said, "You can have all over the 4s. 6d. and 5 per cent out of the 3s. 6d." He "aid he had got some sample flowers. I had offered to sell him the six hand<lb/>kerchiefs for 1s. 6d., which it my price, at which I have sold dozens, and he offered to give me these flowers for them. As they are about the same value I took them and put them in my silk hat, which is the way we always carry sample flowers. I never bought any other flowers from him. He told me it was some flowers he was taking home to his wife, and in the trade anybody in the employ of a florist can have a few flowers by asking for them for their female friends. I have always borne a good character.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Dunton's father was an artificial flower maker, but he had a speciality in plant flowers instead of bonnet flowers. Every flower maker uses lawn. Dunton was carry<lb/>ing the flowers in his hat, and I said to him, "You have spoilt these—you ought to wear a silk hat." Every statement Dunton has made about this is absolutely untrue.</p>

                  </hi>, Sermon Lane, Clerkenwell. I have been living with prisoner three years on and off. On August 24 I was drinking at the "George" public-house with him and another man. Prisoner left the house first. I drank up my glass of beer and followed him to Sermon Lane. He said, "Are you going upstairs to bed?" I said, "Yes, if you ain't going to touch me." He said, "I am not going to touch you; I won't</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110079"/>
               <p>speak to you." He said again, "Are you going to bed?" I said, "I said, "I am presently." He said, "You are, are you?" I said, "Yes, if you are not going to touch me." With that he took hold of my throat, threw me on a chair, and I knew no more. I did not feel anything. As he laid hold of my throat, I said, "You are choking me; do leave me alone." I found myself saturated with blood. I then said, "Oh, my goodness, whatever have you done? You have murdered me." So with that I tried to call for help. He went down the stairs first. I followed him down, and saw a constable. I was stabbed in the chest and shoulder. I was taken direct to the station, and the doctor put stitches in. The wounds are heating up very nice, but the doctor says I am sure to feel them with the change of weather. I think prisoner had been drinking. I could hardly tell when he was drunk or sober at times. He is a heavy drinker.</p>

                  </hi>, Police Surgeon, K Division. On August 25, at 1.10 a.m., the last witness was brought to Upper Street Police Station. I examined her. Her clothes were satu<lb/>rated with blood. I found a wound on the left shoulder pro<lb/>ceeding downwards 21/2 inches, sufficiently deep to out through all the layers of the skin and lay bare the muscle. Over the heart was a stab three-quarters of an inch long, sufficiently deep to lay bare the muscle. A little deeper it would have been fatal, as it would have hit the heart and caused immediate death. I think the knife caught the rib, and that saved the woman's life. The injuries might have been caused by the knife pro<lb/>duced. There was blood on the haft. Force mutt have been used, as it is not a very sharp knife. I stitched the wounds and the woman went to the infirmary. She is going on well.</p>

I went into the stable and saw prisoner coming down the steps. I asked him if he was the man who did it, and he said "Yes, I done it with this knife," which I found upon him.

                  </hi>, blacksmith, 27, Ellesmere Road, Poplar. On September 9, at about 11.30 p.m., I was at the corner of Canton Street, Poplar, talking with James Schofield, a ship-wright, when prisoner crossed over to us and said, "What do you want?" I said, "Nothing," and with that he struck me under the ear. I fell down, and on putting my hand to my head found I was bleeding. I said to my friend, "I am cut." With that my friend went to my assistance, and after a struggle he found that he was cut. Prisoner ran away. Another young gentleman, Rose, was coming down the street with his young lady, total strangers to me, and prisoner went for him. I went to the station, where my wounds were dressed. I have seen prisoner and his wife, but never had any conversation with them.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. It is untrue that I had been having anything to do with your wife. I had not been quarrelling with you and your wife, as you were coming along Upper North Street. I did not say "Annie, come with me to the coffee stall." I did not strike the first blow with some sharp instrument, caus<lb/>ing the present injury to your eye.</p>

                  </hi>, employed by Mr. John Albert Smith, patent medicine vendor, Shoe Lane. On February 5 I was sent to buy postage stamps and went to the Fleet Street Office. I had in my overcoat left-hand pocket three letters, one containing postal-orders amounting to £2 9s. 6d. and sealed. I bought £6 worth of 21/2 £d. stamps and £2 worth of 1d. stamps, which I put in the same pocket with the letters. There were several people in the post-office. In front of me was a very short old lady. She was paying some money into the Post Office Savings' Bank—14s. She took some considerable time fumb<lb/>ling about for the money. On the right-hand side some man was pushing me on the elbow. I looked down and saw that he was very short and very stout. I could not swear to the man. He had on a bowler hat and blue coat. I had the stamps in my pocket at the time and wanted to purchase some postal-orders. When I got to the postal-order department there was someone pushing me very hard. I looked and again saw this short, stout man, but I did not take any particular notice. As I turned round to come out of the post-office I put my hand in my pocket to feel for the letters I had to post and found that the stamps and two of the letters were gone. The build of the prisoner is the build of the man I saw, but I cannot swear to him. I told one of the female clerks of my loss and then went down to the Bridewell Police Station. On the Tuesday after August Bank Holiday I was taken to the Mansion House and out of about fourteen men identified prisoner as being, to the best of my belief, the man who had pushed my elbow.</p>

                  </hi>, counter clerk, at Mark Lane Post Office. On February 10 last two men came in, one of whom (prisoner) tendered me two sheets of 21/2 £d. stamps. I told him it was necessary to fill in an application form. He wanted cash for the stamps. The rule of the service is that he must state who he is, and on the authorities being satisfied that he is the lawful owner, they will purchase, but such transactions are very rare. While filling in the form prisoner had some conver<lb/>sation with the other man. The name prisoner wrote on the form was James Gardiner, and the address, 27, Old Church Road. Commercial Road, E. He left the stamps which would be forwarded to the chief office of the Clearing House branch and there examined. The issue of the warrant for the return of the money is within the discretion of the Poatmaster General. If issued it would be sent to the office nearest to Commercial Road.</p>

               <p>Police-Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">FERGUSSON</hi> gave evidence as to the arrest of the prisoner, who said, "I know nothing about the stamps." At Bridewell Station he was placed with 13 other men and iden<lb/>tified by the witness Patmore. At Mansion House application was mode by a relative that prisoner's watch and chain might be given up for the purpose of providing money for the defence. When witness asked him for a written authorisation to give up the property he said, "I may as well tell you that I did go to Mark Lane and offer these stamps for sale. I had found them the day previous. When I saw I had given the name I am known by and the right address, I saw I had done wrong, and I ran away."</p>

                  </hi>, a Norwegian boatswain. On Aug. 23 about midnight, I was walking along the Rhodeswell Road, when three fellows came behind me, seized me by the throat, knocked me down, took my watch, chain, compass and hat, and ran away. I had a "blue" eye, but cannot say whether it was hit by a fist. I met a policeman who asked where was my hat, and I told him three fellows had got it. I saw the hat at the police-station the same night and identified it. I did not see the faces of the men who attacked me. I felt the injury to my throat for fourteen days.</p>

While standing at the corner of Tyne Street at the junction with Rhodeswell Road, we saw three men running towards us from the direction of Gough Street. We called on them to stop. They refused and in turning round, threw something away. The prisoner Desena turned to the left towards Commercial Road. I gave chase and eventually</p>

After I had caught Desena I took him back to where I had seen something thrown away and found the hat and the other things. I asked him what he had been doing and he said "All right, governor; it is only a bit of a fight with a couple of roughs down the street. They used their belts and we ran away." Five minutes after the arrest of Desena I had Hoy in custody. I recognised him as the companion of Desena. When I told them they would be put amongst others for identification, Desena said, "It is a sure thing. We are sure to be picked out of this."</p>

I said to Wood, "There is something wrong here" and we called upon them to stop. Instead of that, they turned round and ran up Gough Street. They afterwards separated, Desena running to the left and the other two men to the right. I followed Hoy. When he got to Parnham Bridge, he mounted the parapet and jumped down on to the towing path, a distance of 14 feet, and there he was captured by 262 H, who had answered my whistle. Hoy when captured said, "All right, governor; it was only a street fight."</p>

The third man happened to get away, but Hoy jumped over the bridge, a distance of about 14 ft. I jumped after him and caught him. He said, when caught, "All right, governor; it is only a street fight. I will go quiet." I took him to Lime-house Police Station, and prosecutor, about ten minutes after<lb/>wards, came in and identified his hat, which was lying on the table.</p>

                  </hi>, assistant divisional surgeon, K Division. I examined the witness O'Hovde on the 24th ult. He com<lb/>plained of pain in the throat and difficulty in swallowing and in speaking. I found red marks on either side in the region of the voice organ such as would correspond with a grip of the hand. The throat was already swelling. Besides the red marks it was evident from the examination that prosecutor had a diffi<lb/>culty in swallowing, so that the grip must have been severe. He also had a graze or bruising of the left eye, which I think was probably caused by a fall. I also examined Desena, who complained that he was suffering from heart disease, and I found he had severe palpitation, but nothing more than that. The palpitation would be accounted for by a man whose heart</p>

                  </hi>, cheese buyer: 'J. D. Link and Sons. Central Market On July 16 I bought 69 cheeses at Messrs. Delcomyn, Tooley Street, of three marks—28 boxes "Superb Blossom 19," 18 boxes "Canadian Produce D 115," and 23 boxes "Canadian Produce D 120," for £112 6s. 1d. I bought them from samples of three fives which I tasted. Ten were to be delivered direct from Tooley Street, and the remaining 59 by Eliza Wells and Son, Limited, on July 18. On July 30 I saw 43 boxes which I believe to be part of those I purchased, by the marks which I identify, and ten other boxes which I identify. Some of the marks had been scraped off and "Peggy brand" put on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. What I bought were all Canadian cheeses—they differ in quality. I only saw 15 boxes when buying.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. The price of this cheese varies from 40s. to 70s. per cwt. "D" is the shipping mark for the name of the consignee, Delcomyn, and would be used frequently. The number added is only used once in a season. The "D" might be used by other shippers.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-Inspector, City Police. On July 30, at 8.15 p.m., I went with other officers to 86, Lower Clap<lb/>ton Road. No. 86 is a barber's shop with a private door at</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110087"/>
               <p>the side, and at the rear a ware room in which the prisoner carries on business as provision dealer. The prisoner entered the private door and I said to him "We are police officers, and are making inquiry about some cheeses that have been brought here during the last fortnight." He said, "Come in" We went into the ware room and I then pointed to two cheeses which were there, and asked him where he bought those cheeses from. He said, "Kearley and Tonge." I asked him how many he had bought during the last four weeks. He said, "Eight" I then said, "We are going into the basement. What have you got down there?" He did no, reply and we all went down to the basement. It consists of one large room about 12 feet by 14 feet, and there are three doors, one under<lb/>neath the staircase where coals are kept, one to a sort of number room about 8 feet by 4 feet, and a padlocked door leading to a dark cellar 10 feet by 8 feet. The large room had a quantity of plumber's and builder's material in it. When I saw the padlocked door I said "Have you got the key of this." He said, "No; it does not belong to me, it belongs to a man in the City Road." At the same time he pointed to 2 pairs of steps with the words, "Helves, City Road," on them. I then forced the padlock from the door. He said, "You must not do that to other" people's property." I said, "I have done it" When the door was opened, I found 43 bores, each con<lb/>taining a cheese. I asked prisoner, "How do you account for the possession of these cheeses?" He said, "Well, it is like this. A van was coming along, the other day, and there was something wrong with one of the wheels, and the wife allowed the man to put them in here; but there, I have paid a fair price for them." I said, "Who did yon pay?" He said, "A man up the road in a public-house." I asked if he had seen him since—if he knew him. He said, "No." I asked him how he paid. He said, "In cash." I then told him he would be charged with receiving these cheeses well knowing them to have been stolen. He made no reply. I showed him the memorandum (produced), which I had found in the house on a file among other bills. "Memorandum from Newson and Co., Tooley Street, E.C., to Hyde and Co., Clapton. July 18, 1906. Please receive" and then what was 65 boxes of cheese was altered to "59." He said, "Yes, I know where you got that." He was taken to Hackney Police Station, and on being searched, there were found on him several keys, one of which fits the padlock on the cellar door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have never seen the stamped invoice pro<lb/>duced. I had with me Inspector Divall, Detective-sergeant Hine, Detective Smith, and three others. We all went down into the cellar. I think there were some other goods taken possession of by the other officers which do not relate to the</p>

               <p>charge. I did not see anything but the cheeses in the cellar. There was some tea and other goods taken from somewhere in the basement. When I went there I said that the cheese I was inquiring about was a quantity of cheese that had been stolen. Prisoner said, "You can come in and have a look." When I asked him where he bought his cheese I referred to the particular cheeses in the wareroom. I may have asked him how many he had bought from Kearley and Tonge. I brought away one file of documents. There were others there. I pro<lb/>duce member's card of the Southend Trotting Club, purchased July 18 and August 4.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I am clear that I asked him if those two were all the cheeses he had on the premises, and he replied, "Yes."</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-Sergeant, City Police. I went with Inspector Crouch and other officers to prisoner's home on July 30. In answer to Crouch, prisoner said, "I have no cheese anywhere else. Those are all I have," referring to the two on the warehouse floor. "I have only had cheese from Kearley and Tonge." We then went into the basement. De<lb/>tective Crouch said, pointing to a cellar which was padlocked, "Who occupies that cellar?" Prisoner said, "The plumber." Crouch said, "Who holds the key?" Prisoner said, "I do not." Crouch then proceeded to force the door. Prisoner said, You must not break open another man's place." When the door was open Crouch pointed to 43 boxes of cheese which were there and said, "Whose cheese are these?" Prisoner said, "They are mine." Crouch said, "Where did you get them?" Prisoner said, "I bought them. I paid a fair price for them." Crouch said, "Who did you buy them from?" Prisoner said, "I do not know his name. It is like this: My wife took them in. A man drove up in a van and asked her to let him put them in the warehouse, as something had gone wrong with the wheel of the van." Crouch said, "When did you last see him—have you seen him since?" Prisoner said, "He came to me a day or two after and asked me to buy them, and I agreed to pay him 57s. a cwt.' Crouch said, "Have you paid anything for them?" He said, "Yes; I have paid him £20 and £10." Crouch said, "How?" Prisoner said, "Cash." Crouch said, "Where?" He said, "In a public-house up the road." Crouch said, "Where does he live?" Prisoner said, "I do not know." Crouch said, "Have you any receipt?" Prisoner said, "No." He was then taken into custody. In the same cellar I found a scraper or spokes have, and six stencil plates, including "W. H. and Co." and "Peggy Brand." In the same cellar were six or seven cases of sardines and some bottles of wine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I took notes at the time of prisoner's answers, not Crouch's questions, up to the time of the forcing of the door. Then I was in the dark, and I did not take notes</p>

I am a wholesale provision merchant, carrying on business at 86, Lower Clapton Road, and have been in business 20 years, during which time I have had no charge brought against me. On July 18 I was at Southend with Mr. Flood, Mr. J. Warman, Mr. Nethercott, a butcher of Hackney, and a number of other men that I know. The member's racing card produced is mine, and is punched on that date. I left Southend at 10.27 p.m., and arrived home at 12.50. As my wife was going upstairs she told me that some cheese had been left during the day, that a man had called and said something was the matter with his van, and she had given him permission to leave the cheese in our warehouse. The next morning I saw them in the warehouse. I got a letter at 8 a.m. on July 19, which I have destroyed, saying, "Re cheese left on your premises yesterday. As we think you are a buyer of cheese, would you purchase this particular parcel to save us taking it away at 58s. per cwt.—Newson and Co., Tooley</p>

I told him I had not thought anything more about it, and said, "I have your letter, it is true, but I have only just got up. In fact, I have not seen the cheese. I do not know anything about what you left." We then went into the warehouse and examined the cheese. I said I should not give so much as 58s. I offered him 56s., and he accepted it. We took the weights from the boxes. He produced some blank invoices, made out the invoice produced for £113 8s., and said, "How will you pay for them?" I said, "I cannot pay you to<lb/>day; I want the usual terms"—that is a month. He then said, "Well, give me something to bind the bargain." I said, "Will £10 do?". He said, "Very well." I paid him £10, and he wrote the £10 on the invoice, put a stamp upon it—balance £103 8s.—and said, "I will call at the end of the month for the balance." He then left and I have not seen him since. I put the receipt in the letter-rack in my private room upstairs where I keep all the invoices. The delivery note produced I never saw until the police showed it to me at Hackney Police Station on July 30 about 10 p.m., and said to me, "You know this paper?" I said, "Yes, you got it off the file." The cheeses remained in the warehouse until Friday, 20th, when I instructed my man to take them into the cellar, where they were found. I let out part of the basement to Lewis, of Atherton Road, plumber. I sold ten cheeses to Blott, two to Warman, and four to other customers. I took off the brand and marked them with my "Peggy Brand," which I have used for 12 years. The marks of those in the cellar had not been touched. On July 30, when I returned from Stratford, a number of police-officers were at my place. As I got out of the trap they stood round me and said, "Are you Hyde?" I said, "Yes." They said, "We are police-officers. You will have to come with us." I said, "Oh, indeed; you will let me put my pony away first." We went into the warehouse, and they pointed out some cheeses which were standing close to the counter and Detective Crouch said, "Where do you usually buy your cheese from?" I said, "Kearley and Tonge." He then said, "Are these all the cheeses you have from Kearley and Tonge?" I said, "Yes." I believe he said, "How many have, you bought from Kearley and Tonge?" I said, "About eight during the past month." We went into the basement. Crouch asked if I had the key of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110091"/>
               <p>front cellar. I said, "No," as I did not think I had it on me. He was in the act of breaking the door open when I said, "Do not do that." He had already broken the staple of the padlock off. He went in and said, "How do you account for this cheese?'" I said that a man had met with an accident and had asked my wife to let him put the cheese in the warehouse until the next day. He then said, "Do you know these cheeses have been stolen?" I said, "No, I do not. I have paid a fair price for them." He said, "We shall have to arrest you." The key of the cellar was found on me. I did not know I had it, as it is usually kept upstairs. I told them the cellar was occupied by the plumber—not the part that is locked—that is occupied by me, and we keep it locked. The receipt was obtained by my solicitor from my wife while I was in Brixton Prison.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I thought I had had a transaction with Newton and Co. before, some years ago. I have never been to Tooley Street to see them. Had I been at home I should probably not have taken in the cheese. The man who came to see me was very business-like, and that took me off my guard. I did not tell the police I met him in a public-house up the road. I said, "He has only been here once," I was not talking to the police more than three or four minutes before I was taken to the station. The delivery note was not shown to me till 10 p.m., and I had never seen it before. The boy must have put it on the file when the cheeses were put in the warehouse.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of prisoner. At about 1.50 p.m. on July 10 a man banged at the door of the warehouse, and asked for Mr. Hyde, who was not in. He said he bad had a slight accident to one of the wheels of his van, and wanted to ask Mr. Hyde if he would allow him to leave hit goods there till he got another van. I told him Mr. Hyde was not in and I could do nothing in the matter. He then said he thought if Mr. Hyde was at home he would not mind his leaving the goods there, as he was afraid to go any further in case he had a breakdown, and he would fetch them in the morning. The man seemed in trouble, and, after a lot of hesitation, I con<lb/>sented to his leaving the things. He went away, and after a few minutes came back with a small black-covered one-horse van. I then told the boy Albert Storer to take them in. My husband came home at one o'clock in the morning, and I just mentioned to him that a man had left some cheeses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When Inspector Divall came, he asked me about it. He was there two hours before prisoner came home. He did not search the house—only downstairs. The police did not touch the files or books or letter racks in my pretence. Inspector Divall took a statement from me, which I signed. I said to him, "I know nothing of 59 cheeses that were de<lb/>livered last Thursday week, the 18th inst., nor have I ever teen</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110092"/>
               <p>them." He said to me, "You went round to the stable and fetched the boy." I said, "It is a he; I did not. I handed the boy the keys from the street door." Then I asked him if he would like to see the place. I was so confused I do not know what I did say.</p>

                  </hi>, 90, Coppermill Lane. In July last I was in the employ of the prisoner. Mrs. Hyde gave me the key of the warehouse, and asked mo to take the cheese in. The man brought the cheese in find I stacked them up. The carman gave me the delivery note, and I signed a similar note. "65" boxes was altered to "59" by him. Two days afterwards I pot them in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The delivery note was already written in ink. I counted only 59 cheeses, and then the carman altered the note from 65 to 59. I put it on the file. I had never seen the man before. I left the prisoner of my own accord. I took some money that belonged to him, and went away before he found it out. I did not see a reward bill at Bishopsgate Street Police Station describing 59 cheeses and offering a reward for information. [Bill shown to the prisoner.] I did see that bill, and saw Inspector Crouch, and signed a statement giving in<lb/>formation on July 30.</p>

                  </hi>. I am prisoner's wife. On Sunday, June 17 last, we were living at 3, Hanover Cottages, Hammersmith. I asked prisoner if I could go to Petticoat Lane to get a suit for my little boy. He said, "Yes" and I went. At 20 to four I returned. Prisoner was upstairs in bed. When he came down I laid out his dinner. He said he did not want it and threw it into the grate. I took my two children with me and went to 11, Hanover Cottages—that is Mrs. Young's house. I lived with her for five years before I was married. She and her husband and the prisoner were on good terms. On Thursday, June 21, just before noon, I went home to No. 3 and went upstairs to get some clothes for my children. At the top of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110093"/>
               <p>stairs prisoner rushed out at me and I ran into the street. He caught me up and struck me and cut my throat with a razor, saying, "I will kill you." I got the razor away from him, and be went away. The police took me to the hospital That is all I remember.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. While the prisoner was in prison he sent me this letter (produced). [In the letter prisoner asked hit wife not to be hard on him for the sake of the dear little chil<lb/>dren, and promised to turn over a new leaf. It went on: "Dear Polly,—I have forgiven you all the wrong you have done to me, and I hope you will be the same to me. I know it was not all your doing, you was led to it, or else you would not have been to bad to me. Hope you will soon get better.

                  </hi>, Police-Sergeant, 46 T. At the hospital prisoner said to me, "You will find something behind tome pic<lb/>tures in my house." I went to the home and found the two pictures produced. On the back of one was the following: "When you find us I hope you won't say I was mad when I committed this deed. I am perfectly sane, and I hope she judge will make an example of Mrs. Young, for she is the woman responsible for all this. My beloved wife was enticed away from home. I love my wife and children, and I pray the Almighty to tee that my young children are well cared for, and when my so loved home is told my with is to have the money put away for my children. Pray do not make a lot of fuss about this, as I have done this to save my beloved wife going wrong. Good-bye and God bless all." At the back of the picture was the following: "P.S.—I have not deserved the treatment I have bad this last six weeks, and I could not stand it any longer. It was all through Mrs. Young enticing my beloved wife from home because the knew the had money. I am quite prepared to meet my doom, but I don't admit that I have committed any tin, and I know God will receive me."</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">FURNELL</hi>. recalled, further cross-examined. I have been married nearly three years, and have two children. Prisoner has been not much of a father to hit children. He was in the army for a number of years, at far at I know. I was not mar<lb/>ried three months before he struck me. Q. You cannot say a single good word for him? A. I can say a good word and' I can say a bad word. We once had a little greengrocer's busi<lb/>ness; it was given up ten weeks before this occurrence; it was given up because prisoner robbed me through thick and thin. When, we went into the business I had £100; when we gave it up I had £10; we were in it about three months. Prisoner had a pension; out of it he gave me a sovereign; that helped to clothe his children. I knew him five year before we married. On Sunday morning, June 17, between nine and 10, Ada Young</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110094"/>
               <p>came in; she did not ask me to go to Petticoat Lane; I asked her, and I asked prisoner, too. Petticoat Lane is a pretty good way from Hammersmith. It is not the fact that prisoner had objected to my going with the Youngs; he was always with them himself. The words in prisoner's letter, "You was led to it," refer no doubt to the Youngs. It is not the fact that prisoner objected to my going to Petticoat Lane this Sunday morning, and that I said, "Mind your own b——business. I will go where I b——well like." It was about quarter to 12 when I left, and I got back at 20 to four. I was not in the habit of frequently going to Petticoat Lane with Mrs. or Miss Young. I did not return home until the Thursday, although I saw prisoner on the Monday. Miss Young is a laundry girl. Q. Did not prisoner ask you to stop at home, and did not you say, "I am not going to stop with a p——y periaher like you?" A. Never. How can you stand there and say such a thing. I never struck prisoner; he always struck me. I did not take off one of my boots and hit him with it on the face; I was too fright<lb/>ened of him. On the Monday night I went into the Lyric (Hammersmith) with Mr. and Mrs. Young. Prisoner came there and blackguarded me and called me shocking names. I did not start swearing outside the Lyric. He did not say, "Where you go I will go with you." Mrs. Young did not turn to him and say, "I don't want you following me, you white-livered bl——r." Prisoner said to me, "What was you before I married you?' and called me a dirty whore. Mrs. Young then said, "She was never that; she worked too hard." On the Tuesday I took out a summons against him for threats. He was always threatening to take my life. The reason I did not stay at home was that my life and the children's would be taken. On the Tuesday Mrs. Young went with me to the police-court. When we left we went to a public-house opposite the court. On the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday I saw my husband, but I never spoke to him; I never looked at him. I never spat in his face. On Wednesday night I went home in prisoner's absence and took away some clothing. I remember on Wednesday morning seeing a little girl with a loaf of bread. I asked her, "Who is that bread for?" She said, "Uncle," meaning the prisoner. I said, "Well, my children has got no bread and I will fake the loaf," and I took it. It is not the fact that in April I took up a table knife to strike pri<lb/>soner with.</p>

I heard prisoner say, "That woman is the cause of it all." refer<lb/>ring to Mrs. Young. Prisoner seemed very agitated, and I think he did not know what he was doing.</p>

               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">ADA YOUNG</hi>. Mrs. Furnell came to my house on June 17 and stayed there four nights with her two children. On June 21, about noon, I saw her lying on the ground in the court, and prisoner was drawing something across her throat. I had always been in friendly relations with prisoner; he used to come to my house and I have been to his. He was with my husband on Sunday, June 17.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I follow no occupation. My husband is a labourer, in regular work. My daughter Ada is just 20; she is a laundress. Mrs. Furnell came to my house before noon on the 17th and asked my daughter to go with her to Petticoat Lane. About six in the evening she came again, and stayed ail night. I never heard prisoner ask his wife to return home. I know he was annoyed that she had left him; I took her in out of kindness. On the Monday night I remember prisoner coming up to me and his wife when we were going to the Lyric; I did not hear what he said to her, but he called her most foul names, and I told him he was no man to say such things to his wife. I had always told her that it would be better to go home, but she would not It is not correct that prisoner has come to me and protested against my harbouring his wife; we have always been the greatest of friends. With reference to the writing at the back of the pictures, all that prisoner says about me is untrue. I have always done my best for his wife and for him too. I never enticed her from her home; I have asked her to go home from time to time, because she would be blamed if she stayed away, but she would not go.</p>

                  </hi>. 737 T. On going towards Hanover Cot<lb/>tages on this morning I found prisoner walking away; I took him back to his wife; she was lying on the footpath with her throat cut. I asked prisoner what the trouble was; he said, "All right, guvnor, I have done it; she has driven me to do it; she has been asking for it a long while; it is all through another woman; I wish I had done it in." I found prisoner had his throat cut, and I took him to the hospital. On search<lb/>ing him I found on him two razors and a pocket-knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The two razors I found on him were in addition to the one with which he cut the woman's throat. When T spoke to prisoner he was troubled and upset, but he seemed quite right in his head.</p>

                  </hi>, house surgeon, West London Hos<lb/>pital. Prosecutrix was admitted on June 21. She had a deep cut across the back of the neck and another cut across the throat, and minor cuts on the chest and across the hands. One of the cuts only just missed one of the carotids. I think these wounds may have been caused by a razor; the wound at the back of the neck involves a great deal of force having been used. Prosecutrix was for a day or two in a precarious condi<lb/>tion. She was in the hospital five or six weeks. She is quite recovered now. Prisoner was also admitted. He had a wound across his throat, not very deep. It was not a dangerous wound, but it festered, and he remained in the hospital a month.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The position and character of the wounds on prosecutrix indicate that the person inflicting them would be in a rage, more or less beside himself. When prisoner was ad<lb/>mitted he seemed highly strung, but he was of quite sound mind.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am 31 years old. I served in the Army for eight years, leaving with a good cha<lb/>racter in April, 1903. I married prosecutrix in February, 1904. In January, 1906, we set up in a greengrocery business. The Youngs used to come and see my wife, and the acquaintance continued after we gave up business. I was on pretty good terms with Mr. Young, not much with his wife. I always ob<lb/>jected to my wife associating with Mrs. Young or her daughter. Since last January my wife has been in the habit of using bad language to me and striking me. The greengrocery business had to be given up because of my wife going about and spend<lb/>ing the money. I had a pension of £2 5s. a quarter. I used to give my wife 20s. or 30s. out of it. On Sunday, June 17, I got up about hail-past eight and went downstairs to get the breakfast ready. When my wife came down she went to Mrs. Young's. She came back presently, had breakfast, and washed the children. Then Miss Young came and asked my wife to go to Petticoat Lane. I did not want her to go. I called to her and said, "What do you want to go up there for?" She said, "Mind your own b——business. I will go where I like." She then went away with Miss Young. She came back about quarter to four. I had had no dinner. I was upstairs asleep. I woke up about half-past six and went downstairs. She asked me, "Do you want any b——g tea?" I said, "Not till I had had a wash." With that, she got up and abused me something awful. She left the house and I did not see her again till the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110097"/>
               <p>Monday morning. When she came back I said to her, "Where have you been to?" She said, "I have been out whoring. Where the b——y hell do you think I have been" I then said to her, "Are you going to stop at hornet" She said she did not intend to stop with a b——y perisher like me. She then took off her boot and struck me on the face with it and spat in my face; she went away. About half an hour after<lb/>wards the came up the street with a jug to fetch beer, and as she passed me she called me a rotten, dirty dog. On the 18th I met Mr. Young coming home from work. I stopped him and asked him to turn my wife away from his house, not to encourage her there; he said, "It is nothing to do with me, I cannot help it." About half-past seven I was standing at the door when my wife, Mrs. Young, and Miss Young came by, going to the theatre. When they passed me they abused me something awful, and my wife and Mrs. Young spat in my face. About 10 minutes afterwards I went to see where my wife had gone. I found her drinking in a public-house with Mrs. Young, Mr. Young, and Miss Young. I asked her if she would come home, and she said she did not intend to return with me again. They walked towards the theatre and I followed them. Mrs. Young turned to me and said, "I don't want you following me, you white-livered bl——r." I said I was not following her, but I was going where my wife went. They were abusing me all the way along. We got to the door of the theatre, when Mrs. Young mined at me, put her two fists in my face, and said, "I'll smash your fact, you rotten bastard." I walked away to fetch a constable to give her in charge. I went to the police station, and they said they could do nothing for me, but that I might take out a summons. On the Tuesday I went to the police court for a separation order and for a sum<lb/>mons against Mrs. Young; I was refused. On leaving the court I saw my wife, with Mrs. Young and another woman and a man, drinking in the "Clarendon," just opposite. When they left the public-house my wife abused me again. On the Wed<lb/>nesday I was afraid to go out because of my wife's conduct; I thought she might come and break the home up. I stopped at the door, and each time she passed she abused me, using awful language. I had had nothing to eat since Monday, and had not been to bed all the week. I went out for a short time, and on returning found the doors had been burst open and some things taken away. On Thursday morning I was that hungry I sent my little niece for a loaf of bread; the came back with<lb/>out it. I went upstairs and locked myself in. My wife and Miss Young came and forced opened the doors; as soon as my wife saw me she van and I ran after her and caught her; that is all I remember; I wrote the messages on the pictures about eight that morning. I do not remember when I got the razors and the knife. I cannot explain what my feelings were; I was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110098"/>
               <p>so much upset with my wife's conduct. I always loved my children. Every word in the statements on the pictures is true.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have witnesses to prove that my wife struck me. I went to the police court for a summons, it was refused; I was ordered out of court. I cannot say why I put the razors in my pocket; it is usual for a man to carry a knife.</p>

                  </hi>, labourer, 167, Dew Road, Silvertown, I was out<lb/>side the Henley Anne, in the Albert Road, on the night of Sunday, July 15, at five minutes past 11 in company with Dick Austin and Jim Crowley. Prisoner Kellers knocked me down and stabbed me twice in the head with a knife. Vigod also struck me and I saw Vigod strike Austin in the back with a pocket knife. I found afterwards I had been cut. I did not say anything to prisoners and had had no previous quar<lb/>rel with them. I had known Kellers three or four months, and Vigod two months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. This was an entirely unprovoked assault by Kellers. It is not true that I assaulted Kellers and that I struck back at Mm. I did not use filthy and disgusting language to these men, nor hear Austin do so. Neither of us called them "f——g bastards of Germans." There were several other men there, also Germans.</p>
               <p>Vigod being unrepresented, the evidence was translated to him through an interpreter.</p>

He was suffering from two wounds in the head, one 1/2 in. long, about 2 in. above the right eye; the other 11/2 in. long, about 31/2 in. above the left eye on the frontal bone. Both wounds had clean-cut edges and extended to the bone. In the latter there was a bleeding artery, which I tied. The wounds might have been caused with a knife, but a blunt instrument, such as a fist or a stick, would cause a wound of similar appearance. The skin over the scalp, being tightly stretched, a blow with a foreign body would cause the appear<lb/>ance of an incised wound.</p>

When Germans go into a public-house there are always people to insult them. A few people outside—amongst them Shine and Austin—used insulting language and threw me down. I called for help and Vigod came and helped me. I had no knife in my hand. I simply pushed Shine away.</p>

He heard Kellers cry out, "Vigod, help me!"and when he came out he received a blow on the chest and was thrown to the ground.

She had not since lived with him.</p>

                  </hi>, single woman, 66, Anson Road, Tufnell Park. At 3.15 on the afternoon of July 20 I recollect being at the corner of Anson Street and Calcott Road. I had a bag or purse, and was about to cross. Two men came along as if they were going up the road and cross in front of me. As I stood not knowing which way to go Davies took me by the left arm and shook me. The other prisoner seized me by the right arm. There may have been another man, but I could not identify him I hit the right hand man in the face with some rolled up music. There was no one about. I was hit very violently on the back of the head, not necessarily by one of the prisoners, who, I think, were holding me with both hands, and I was stunned for the moment When I came to myself Davies was exactly in front of me, and I seized him by the neck and clung to him, and being partially stunned, I suppose I did not hold him very tightly, but I did bend him down, and eventually he ran away. When I came to myself I had nothing in my hands. I had been carrying an umbrella, purse, and music. The purse con<lb/>tained £3 14s. Before the magistrate I said it contained £6, but I remembered afterwards I had paid away about £3. I ran down the road after the two men, and cried, "Stop thief." They separated, and I pursued Sounders along Cardwell Road, but did not catch him. After I had stopped running Davies was brought back to me by a Mr. Knight. At the police station I charged him simply with purse-snatching. I did not recollect until four hours afterwards that I had been Attacked. Davies said, "I dare you to say I took your purse. Look in my face and see that I am an honest man." I recognised Davies because his face bad been scratched and was bleeding, and you could not put your finger anywhere without touching a wound.</p>
               <p>To prisoner Davies. I am living in Anson Road. I did not see a little girl. I did not say at the police court that three men surrounded me. You are the man I struggled with.</p>

There were two men, one of whom was in a slightly bending position while the other was picking up his cap. The lady seemed rather confused. The two men started to run away. I followed them, as I knew something was the matter. I identify the man who was caught (Davies). I had him in view the whole time, except when he turned the corner. Davies was very violent to Knight, who caught him, and fought with him, but Knight got him down on the road and held him. I was nod present when the first police<lb/>man came, as I had gone to the "Nag's Head" to get a police<lb/>man.</p>

We met Miss Morrison, who accused him of being one of the men concerned in assaulting and robbing her. He said, "Did you see me take the purse?" the purse not having been mentioned. I said, "No." Then he ran away and I ran after him and caught him again. We fell to the ground, and in the struggle he was very violent. He attempted to kick me on the head, and I was a good deal hurt. However, I held on to him. I was not able to work for four days.</p>

                  </hi>, Police-constable, 214 Y. At about half past two on July 20 I was on duty in plain clothes at the corner of Camden and Brecknock Roads, about a quarter of a mile from the spot where the robbery took place, and saw the prisoners walking in the direction of Anson Road. Davies was very much scratched, as though he had been in a fight. For reasons of my own I went home and put my uniform on, and went on duty outside the Athenaeum in Camden Road. Whilst there I was called by Mist Hawker. I went to the corner of Crayford Road, where I saw Davies on his back on the pave<lb/>ment, with Knight on top of him. Davies was kicking violently. I caught hold of the collar of his coat and lifted him up. He then said, "What have I done?" The prosecutrix came up and said she wished to give him in charge. He seemed to be dazed. On the way to the station Davies said, "I know I am done. I cannot get out of being there. The other man has got the purse and got away." On August 28, about 10 p.m., I picked Saunders out of about 12 or 14 other men at Kentish Town Station. Saunders, when identified, said, "You bastard, what clothes were I wearing on July 20 when I was with Jew Boy (Davies)?"</p>

I got him out into the street, where he threw himself on the ground and kicked out right and left. On the way to the station he said, "I am perfectly innocent of that." I said, "Innocent of what? I have not told you yet what you were arrested for. Do you mean the job as Kentish Town?" He said, "Yes" I then told him I should put him up for identification. He said, "You won't get me identified." And I said, "That is left to be proved."</p>

               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">NEALE</hi> described both prisoners as the associates of dangerous thieves, the majority of them being housebreakers.

Where prisoners were standing they could work in several different directions, and a robbery might easily be com<lb/>mitted without being seen. Davies had bad a good education. With regard to Knight, this was not the first occasion he had rendered valuable assistance in the apprehension of prisoners. He had been rewarded by the magistrate, and his conduct would be brought to the notice of the Commissioners.</p>

At nine p.m. on August 2 I was walking down Wardour Street when a man I do not know came in front of me, another came behind, and knocked my hat over my eyes, then the prisoner came and gave me a punch which broke my tooth and bruised my lip. They stole half of the gold watch chain I was wearing. I cannot say which one took it. The prisoner ran away in front of me and the others ran away be<lb/>hind me. It was the prisoner who gave me the punch, and I followed him, crying "Stop thief!"I fell down, but got up immediately and continued running after him until he was arrested. I did not lose sight of him; I saw the back of him all the time he was running away. I recognised him at once at the police-station as the man who struck me in the mouth.</p>

On August 2, at 9.30 p.m., I was with Sergeant West in Wardour Street when I heard a cry and saw the prisoner running about 15 or 20 yards in front of about 20 or 30 people. I took up the chase and ran him into a uniformed constable's arms in Leicester Square. When arrested he said, "I have not got it. I thought they would think it was me. I was only running after some<lb/>one that did it." When charged at the station he said, "Ask him (prosecutor) if he is sure it was me." I found on the pri<lb/>soner another piece of chain. I asked him where he got it from and he said, "I found ft in Leicester Square" I also found a pawnticket on him. He said, "A girl I met in the City the other night gave that to me. I do not know her."</p>
               <p>To the Judge. That has nothing to do with this case. I did not see anyone running in front of the prisoner. The 2nd August was the night when there wag a storm with heavy thunder and lightning, and there were few people in the streets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate. I am very sorry for the man who was robbed. He should not say I did it when he knows I did not.</p>

                  </hi>, 70, Brook Street, Belgrave Square, a mem<lb/>ber of the London Stock Exchange. About seven in the even<lb/>ing on August 30 I was in Hyde Park, and I noticed a man leaving a girl with two children, and she was calling out after him. She said something to me, and I called after prisoner—he was 40 or 50 yards away. I told him to get out of the park or I would give him in charge, and he took up one of the chairs and apparently was going to attack me with it I did not do anything. I noticed someone running—that was Morgan. He was in private clothes, and as he ran up prisoner turned round to attack him. The constable got the chair away after a struggle. The prisoner attacked the constable, and there was a severe struggle, which ended in prisoner being overpowered. The constable told him to leave the park immediately, and he suddenly turned round, took a knife out of his pocket, and I saw his hand come down on the constable's head. I saw a knife in his hand afterwards. His hand apparently struck him on the temple. I saw him make another stab at the constable's ribs. I saw his hand with the knife in it. I saw the knife in it at that time. Constable caught him by the wrist, and held him. Prisoner had no chance of struggling then. The knife was taken away from him.</p>

               <p>to a gentleman passing (Mr. Hawkins) for assistance. He requested him to leave the park. He took up a chair and chased him round. I then went to help, and he came after me with the chair. I took the chair from him, telling him I was a constable, and a struggle ensued. I had no truncheon, and I struck him on the face with my fist. It wag a severe struggle, lasting ten minutes, but I got the better of him. Prisoner fell to the ground. I requested him to leave the park, and he said, "All right "; he turned round to get under the railings, and he took a knife out of his pocket and turned round and stabbed me in the forehead. I caught his hand with mine as it came down. He struggled with me, and I took the knife off him. Powell came up and assisted me in taking the knife off him. I took him to the station, and charged him with interfering with persons in Hyde Park, and maliciously wounding myself. He made no reply whatever. I was off duty a week under the doctors care. Prisoner said, "I used the knife because he exhausted me so."</p>

Morgan went to get the chair away, and as soon as he knocked the chair out of has hands prisoner turned on him with his fists. Morgan got the best of him and knocked pri<lb/>soner down. Prisoner got up and took a knife out of his pocket and stabbed Morgan in the forehead. He raised his hand again and Morgan caught his hand. There was a struggle. Morgan called for assistance. I tried to take the knife away, but I was not successful, but some gentleman in the crowd pulled his fingers back. While I was helping to get the knife away I cut my hand.</p>

Prisoner was lying on the footway asleep. I shook him by the shoulders and said, "Go away home where you belong to." He got up and walked down the hill five yards. He turned round and came back and said, "What is your bloody game—do you think I am a country yokel?" He sprang at me with his right hand clenched. I did not see a knife—he jumped at me and I put my arm up. I found I was stabbed on this arm—blood was running down the arm. He ran down to Pennington Street, and I chased him. When he was a few yards along I heard something fall in Pennington Street. I still pursued him. I ran 160 yards or more. PC. Powell came up—I told him he had stabbed me. "He is the right man—he did it" Then I collapsed. I can remember Redgers coming to my assistance, and I became unconscious. I told P.C. Redgers what occurred, and I was taken to the hospital, where I remained from the 11th to the 19th, and I attended as out-patient till the 31st. I am under the divisional surgeon's care. I am unable to resume duties yet. I never lost sight of prisoner; I was six yards behind him. I did not see any other man, only two women who stood on the hill. No one else was about This is the tunic I was wearing and there is the cut in it.</p>

Prisoner said, "I do not know what you have got me for, I know nothing about it." I took prisoner to Leman Street Station. He was examined by Dr. Jones. He had slight blood on his face and hands, and was slightly under the influence of drink. I was there when he was examined. There were slight abrasions on the left side of the face.</p>

At two o'clock on August 11 I examined Police-constable Green, who had a wound in the bend of the right elbow 3 in. long—the wound was tied with a tourniquet, a knotted handkerchief over the artery, and the wound bled profusely on removing it. Next morning I enlarged the wound and found out all the bleeding points. There was no artery divided, but veins which unite at that spot. The wound was half an inch deep and an inch in length. It was caused by a sharp instrument—it might have been caused by the knife produced. I noticed a stain on one side of the point of the knife which might have been blood. I have not tested it. Police-constable Green was detained 10 days in the hospital.</p>

                  </hi>, detective, H Division. Prisoner was charged on August 11 at Leman Street, and the knife was handed in at the time. Prisoner made no reply. He saw the knife.</p>
               <p>To prisoner. I say you saw the knife at the station. I did not say to the magistrate there was no knife found. I pro<lb/>duced it at the station when you were charged. It was not shown at the police court, but at the station I said, "I shall charge you with wounding the man with this knife." There was no necessity to produce it to the magistrate.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I was coming up St. John's Hill on the night of August 9, and had been drinking all day. There were three or four men at the corner of St. John's Hill, and I sat down at the other corner. There were several girls, and all kinds of sailors, German, French, and Belgian. I sat down on the step, and I know no more. The constable came and hit me. I said, "What are you doing?" I never saw the knife till it was produced in court. The constable knocked me off the step on to the pavement; then I came to my senses. I never had a knife to use. Gooding said he took the knife from me, and he swore on oath that it was the knife, but I wrote to the Police Commissioner, and he told the Governor of Brixton Prison that they found Gooding's evidence unfit to be given to this court: That was on the 22nd. The police are making out that is my knife, but if the knife was thrown it would never go on the window ledge—it must have been placed there. There were plenty of people there. There were more people there when they were taking me to the station than there are in court now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I was sitting down on the doorstep I was asleep. When I looked up I could see it was a constable. I could not say whether it was Police-constable Green. I did not run away. I walked away sharp, and the constable walked after me. All of a sudden I heard a whistle blow. I could not, say whether Green did strike me. I cannot say whether I said, "What is your game?" I do not recollect. I did not say, "Do you take me for a country yokel? I do not look like one."</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On Septem<lb/>ber 15, 1899, I returned from my work, and found my wife had broken up my home. In November, 1899, I was called up for service in South Africa, and I arranged for her to receive 22s. a week while I was in Africa. After serving for 13 months I was wounded and invalided home. On April 24, 1901, I was discharged from hospital. I went to my wife's sister's address, and was denied all knowledge of my wife, and I never saw her from November 9, 1899. She has a child seven years old, and I never knew of it.</p>
               <p>To the Court. When I came back from service I went to Woolwich and made inquiries at her sister's address, and also where she drew her money—65, Barclay Road, Walthamstow. I stopped the money then. She may have been living then, but I had no trace of her. When I saw her in November. 1899, I left my watch with her, and it was handed to me, but I was told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110113"/>
               <p>they knew nothing of her. They did not admit that they had been drawing the money.</p>
               <p>Croat-examined. I was referring to Mrs. Pearse, 20, Wini<lb/>fred Street, South Woolwich. I asked for my wife's address, and I telegraphed to 65, Barclay Road, where the money was tent to. I also personally asked for her. The money we drawn as far as I know; I made no inquiries. If it had not been I should have been told of it. I wrote to my depot, and told them to stop it. I did not make any other inquiries. In the face of the fact that there was a separation order, I say she deserted me, because she. came back and lived with me after that. She had a child, and it was christened while I was at work, and it caused a quarrel.</p>
               <p>. The Judge called attention to the fact that no evidence had been given that the first wife was alive. Julia Kennedy was recalled and stated that that was the fact, and that the was out<lb/>side the court.</p>

                  </hi>, printer. 292, Dawes Road, Fulham. About July 18 two men came to me; Howe was one; I cannot identify the other. Howe said he had a job for me; he produced some printing ink and a wooden letter, the figure "1," for number<lb/>ing. I put this in the machine and made the impression on the card; he then produced some type, and said he wanted some cards printed. I said that it looked like a fraud; he said, "No, I am doing it for the Belle Steamer Company for a machine at Woolwich." I printed about 500 tickets; they were just like the Belle Steamer ticket produced, but without the cross line</p>

               <p>and the number. Later in the evening two other men came and paid me 10s. and took the tickets away; the one who paid me was Starling, the other, I think, was Chick, but he has since grown a beard.

I asked him where he got the tickets from, and he said from his cousin, the secretary of the Cunard line. On a third occasion he offered me 11 tickets for £1. Altogether I bought 20 tickets.

They showed me some tickets, and said, "We have sold two to the landlord over the bar for 8s.; you can have two for 6s., but don't tell him "; they said they had the tickets from an advertising agent. I said I did not want them, I could not afford them; they said, "Well, take two, you might find somebody who can do with them." Later on I saw Starling and Jackson again; I told them I had parted with the two tickets, but that it looked a bit fishy to me, and I had only sold them on condition that they turned out right. They said, "We should not offer them to you if they were not all right." Starling said they had other tickets before, and that on the Sunday previous 11 of them had gone to Margate with them.</p>

                  </hi>, bootmaker, 187, Lillie Road. I know prisoner Rainsley by sight. I knew him in August by the name of Sherry, his second name being Sheridan. He came to my shop in Bank Holiday week and asked me if I wanted two or three boat tickets to Margate. He produced some tickets like the ordinary Belle steamboat tickets. I asked him how he came by them, and he said they were what were given to shopkeepers for exhibiting the company's bills. I told him I did not want them. A week later he called again. I then bought two of the tickets for 4s. He said, "If you do not think they are all right I will leave them with you and you can pay me if you use them." When I got to the steamboat I was told they were forged, and handed them to the police.</p>

The forged ticket is so good an imitation that the officers did not find it out in clipping the tickets, but there are various differences. The blue used it slightly different. The large figure "9" if smaller than in the original, the colour of the red is different. With reference to tickets for advertising, we issue to people who exhibit the Belle bills a quite distinct ticket.</p>

                  </hi>, inspector, Thames Division. On August 3 I was on Fresh Wharf, when a special examination of passenger tickets was made. I stopped about 20 on the 13th, 20 on the 14th, 10 on the 15th, and so the number got smaller and smaller. The total number of tickets I stopped was about 70. I took the names and addresses of the persons who had these tickets and made inquiries which led ultimately to Starling, Chick, and Jackson. On August 14 I saw Chick at Dawes Road, Fulham, where he lives. I asked him where he had got the tickets, and he said, "I got them from a man I do not know who was a steward on the Belle Steamers, and who got the tickets for advertising. I gave him 2s. each for them, and sold them for 2s. 6d. and 3s. I have sold about 20 tickets altogether, in<lb/>cluding Mr. Gould and Mr. Devine." I took him to the police station, and the same morning Jackson and Starling were brought in by other officers. I told Jackson a number of forged tickets were in circulation, and a number of them had been traced to prisoners through other persons. Jackson said, "I bought the tickets of a man I do not know." Starling said, "I bought them from a man I met at the 'Jolly Maltster.'" Chick said, "I did not know they were forged. The man I bought them of said he was a steward of the Belle Steamers." On August 29 prisoners were charged with conspiracy at West London Police Court before Mr. Lane, and Starling said he would give information as to who the printers of the tickets were.</p>

There were half-a-dozen men there. I asked who put the nosebag on. and prisoner replied that he had, and that I was a "f——g starver." I had known prisoner before. I told him if he thought I starved the horse to go to the office and complain. I started at the back of the van to unload and prisoner caught hold of my apron, and pulled me off the van, and we had a fight on the ground. I got upon the forepart of the van next to unload, and when on the van I was fairly high up. Prisoner came up, and threw me right off. My thigh and arm were fractured, and I was taken to the London Hospital on an ambulance, where I was kept in for seven weeks.

                  </hi>, Quiller Street, Walworth, money-lender. In August last prisoner applied to me for a loan. On August 14 I wrote to him asking him to come up with his wife. He signed the form produced in the name of Alfred Popplewell, 32 years of age, married, foreman, etc., and giving an address at Cholmondeley Street. I advanced him £3, in respect of which be signed a promissory note, as for Alfred Popplewell and Florence Popplewell, his wife. It was arranged that the money should be repaid by weekly instalments of 5s. Certain instal<lb/>ments were repaid, and ultimately we took proceedings in the County Court against Mr. Popplewell, who set up that it was aot his signature and applied to the Court to have the judgment set aside. The present proceedings were then taken.</p>

               <p>Mr. C.F. Gill, K.C., and Mr. Bodkin prosecuted. The libel was contained in certain printed documents. The first was a pamphlet published in 1904 with the following head<lb/>ing: "The Hatfield Business. Letters, interviews, overtures. Astounding revelations. The greatest truth in the end will pre<lb/>vail. Price 1s. Published at 21, Gladstone Street. Brighton, by M.L. Stanley." The following is a quotation from the pamphlet: "It was three years later that I found, to my utter astonishment, that after I had left Hatfield House a foul and baseless slander and accusation had been adroitly and designedly attached to my name, for a very apparent reason; and the rumour of this first slander met me everywhere, causing me irreparable injury. Briefly, the origin of this plot, with all its subsequent developments and complications, was as follows: A scandal arose between the chaplain at Hatfield House and a lady of the household who is a member of the Cecil family. It appears that in the year 1890 this lady gave birth to a child, of which it was alleged the chaplain was father. In order to shield this lady of the parentage of this, she infamously attributed it to me, and the necessary tradesmen's bills have actually been made out in my name." The pamphlet was followed by a docu<lb/>ment published in the present year, entitled "The Hatfield Busi<lb/>ness, or Cecil Plot. Addenda. Published at 21, Gladstone Place, Brighton, by M.L. Stanley." The leaflet contained the following: "I regret to learn that one or two points in my pub<lb/>lished pamphlets, 'The Hatfield Business,' were not quite clear,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110121"/>
               <p>to in response to innumerable requests I now give the name of the lady for whom I have been made the scapegoat. It is Lady Gwendolen Cecil. Lady Gwendolen Cecil has designedly thrown it upon me for 15 years, with the most disastrous results, and at a terrible cost both to my husband and myself and others, and I am absolutely determined to endure it no longer. In consequence of distinct information I have received I demand as my right that Lady Gwendolen Cecil will take it into court. She gave birth to a child in 1890 which she has infamously attri<lb/>buted to me. She has the names of the doctor and nurse who attended her, and the tradesmen's bills made out in my name, and the must take her trial in the Law Courts." The pamphlet and leaflet were distributed in August of this year, together with a letter to the King dealing with the matter.</p>

                  </hi>, chief inspector, Scotland Yard. On August 13 I received a warrant from the Bow Street Police Court for the arrest of prisoner. On August 14 I went to Brighton to make some inquiries, and as the result of those inquiries I saw prisoner at the Brighton Railway Station. I asked her if she mi Mrs. Stanley. She said, "Yes." I told her I had a warrant for her arrest for libel, and was about to read it to her on the platform, when she asked if we could go to a more convenient place. I suggested the police station. In the carriage of the train were several parcels. There were other persons with her, some of whom were about to accompany her by rail. I read the warrant to her at the station. It charged her with publishing a libel on Lady Gwendolen Cecil. She was about to make a statement, when I cautioned her that if she said anything it might be used as evidence against her, and I proposed to put it down. I then took out my pocket book and wrote down at her dictation, "I have been expecting this some time, and I am glad now it has come. I have been a very much persecuted and deeply wronged woman, as is perfectly well known to many. I have appealed in a long letter to the King as well as to the public at large for funds for a fair, equal, open trial in the Law Courts, and I mean to fight the case to the bitter end, not only for my own sake but for the sake of everyone concerned, inasmuch as I regard it as a re<lb/>presentative case, and one seriously threatening and involving the rights and liberties of the people." She then produced a manuscript letter, which the said was addressed to the King, and said, "I intended to post it in London, after having con<lb/>sulted my honorary secretary, with 'whom I have an appoint<lb/>ment to-day. Her name is Mrs. Somerville. 68, Thornton Avenue, Chiswick." I then examined one of the large parcels, and found it contained a quantity of printed matter, including 1,000 copies of the "Addenda," 2,000 leaflets, and 500 copies, of the letter to the King. Prisoner said: "The copies of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110122"/>
               <p>Addenda' and leaflets were intended for distribution in Lon<lb/>don at once, and the copies of the Kings letter later on. I have been persecuted for twelve years hour by hour and nothing has been done, but Lady Gwendolen Cecil has only been attacked eight days, and now I am arrested. She is the guilty woman and I am the innocent." I then examined another brown paper parcel, and found it to contain five linen placards: "The Cecil Plot, Terrible Revelations," and things of that kind. Prisoner staid they had already been exhibited on her victoria all over London the previous week and the week before. In the parcel was a large photograph (produced) of the victoria, in which was the defendant with two other women. There was also a wicker basket or portmanteau amongst her luggage, and in it I found a letter addressed to her at 21, Gladstone Place, Brighton, asking to be "supplied with one of the pamphlets and enclosing stamps. I then went to Hartington Road, Brighton, where prisoner had occupied apartments. I there found a large number of the pamphlets and a quantity of correspon<lb/>dence, including some between herself and her husband. There were 650 of the "Addenda," 300 pamphlets. 9,000 leaflets, 1,000 covers, and so on. I produce a bundle of correspondence extending from February. 1904, to August 9, 1906, between Rev. W.H. Stanley and Mrs. Stanley. I also produce a bundle of letters from Mrs. Somerville to Mrs. Stanley from January 22, 1905, to August 5, 1906; also letters from Mrs. Thorpe, Mrs. G.B. Edwards and Mrs. Trigg (members of prisoner's committee) from 1904 to 1906. I also went to 17, Gladstone Place, the address of one of the women who were with prisoner in the victorias I there found 13,000 leaflets and 2,000 "Addenda" I also went to the address which appears on the pamphlets, 21, Gladstone Place, where Mrs. Trigg lives, and where I found a number of copies of the pamphlet, "Addenda," and leaflets. I conveyed her to Bow Street, where she was charged.</p>

On August 10 I was employed to keep watch on a certain house in Woburn Place, Bloomsbury. About the middle of that day I saw prisoner with other persons. They drove away from the house in a victoria. I followed them. They called at various newspaper offices, and returned to Woburn Place. It the afternoon prisoner and the others left the house again in the victoria, and after visiting various other newspaper offices they went to Lincoln's Inn Fields, followed by me. I recognise the persons in the photograph as the persons I saw on August 10. They went to the Sardinia Street side of the Fields. Linen placards were hung upon the victoria, one at the back and one at the side. Those in the victoria gave out</p>

Her father was in the employment of my grandfather and father for a great number of years, and was pensioned by my father. She is a member of a large family, and until 1899 was employed as organist, and as organist would be at Hatfield House for a short morning service and on Sunday evening during the time the family was in residence, which would be sometimes three months and sometimes six. I do not clearly remember the fact of her leaving. I have had no communication with her for years past. A communication was made to me by one of my brothers in August. I was subsequently shown the printed pamphlet, which is called the "Addenda" I am the Lady Gwen<lb/>dolen Cecil referred to therein. There is no foundation, no fragment of truth in the statement. I have not seen the print of the letter to the King.</p>

Beer, of 7, Chesterfield Gardens, once, I think. I did not confess my guilt to Mrs. Beer. I taw her when the came to call at Arling<lb/>ton Street. I did not give Mrt. Beer authority to offer you £1,000 a year to tettle this disgraceful plot; I never heard anything about it. I do not know that any proposal was made that your husband should have a living of £1,000 a year with a view to promotion in the Church. I never heard of any pro<lb/>posal that you should have an annuity of £300 a year for the services you had rendered at Hatfield House. I absolutely deny that. I had a child in 1890, of which Mr. Edwards was the father. I know nothing of any tradesman's bills being made out in your name. I do not know of anything being done n my behalf by any of my near relations to prevent your husband acting as a clergyman. As to your appealing to the late Lord Salisbury for assistance, I used to hear of letters being received, but never anything definite. I never heard of any appeal to</p>

               <p>the family for assistance in connection with any charge or accusation against you in connection with Mr. Edwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no further question to ask, my lord, At present.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. Do not say "at present." If you have any question to ask, ask it now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Lady Gwendolen has denied the maternity, mother-hood of her child.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. I want to see that you understand the course of the trial. If you wish to ask any question of the present witness, do so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is an exceedingly delicate question, but I desire the examination of Lady Gwendolen on Mrs. Beer's confession. The Common Serjeant. Do you wish to ask her any other question?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask her if she would submit to examina<lb/>tion by a jury of matrons.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. I am not going to ask her that, because no jury of matrons can be empanelled for the purpose. There is no such law. Do you wish to ask any question about the facts?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The fact is she confessed to Mrs. Beer, and she denies it, my lord.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. You can call witnesses when the time comes. Do you wish to ask this witness any more questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. No, thank you, my lord.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. Very well, that is enough.</p>

                  </hi>, examined by Mr. Gill. I have been employed at Hatfield House from 1890, and before that date down to the present time I looked after the correspondence coming there. Letters were from time to time written by prisoner to the late Lord and Lady Salisbury and came under my supervision. I was personal private secretary to the late Marquis of Salisbury, and also did the secretarial work for the late Marchioness. I produce letters received from time to time from the defendant from 1889 to February, 1896.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. You left Hatfield in November, 1889. I do not remember that you were to return at the end of the month. At the end of 1889 Lady Salisbury came to the decision that your health was not sufficiently established for you to resume your work, that the substitutes you had appointed were not efficient, that Lord Salisbury had complained of the services, and that therefore it was necessary to appoint an efficient sub<lb/>stitute. I never heard it said that you. stayed away inten<lb/>tionally, though you were asked to go back. I knew Mr. Edwards, and that he had the living of Essendine, being Ap<lb/>pointed in 1890. He then ceased to be chaplain. I never heard that Lady Gwendolen's engagement to Mr. Edwards was ex<lb/>pected.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110125"/>
               <p>This is the first I have heard of it. I know there were warrants out for Mr. Edwards's arrest in 1892. I do not know that he was taken to Hatfield House and allowed to escape. I never heard that he was taken on the warrants. It is not within my knowledge that he escaped on Sunday, July 12, 1902. I heard there were warrants out for his arrest, and the result is not within my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Anyway, Mr. Edwards escaped, and has never been heard of since.</p>
               <p>Witness. He left the rectory at that time, in 1902. I heard he was accused of felony. I never saw the warrant A new rector was appointed soon after. I remember prisoner coming to Arlington Street in July, 1891, to see me by the appointment of the late Lady Salisbury. In the first place, I was instructed by the late Lady Salisbury to recommend or advise—I do not know exactly which word to use—that she should settle her pecuniary difficulties, and to say that until her affairs were made straight Lady Salisbury could not advance her money. I think it was in 1893 that prisoner married Mr. Stanley. In the event of her pecuniary affairs being settled I was to inquire of Miss Sheehan whether any of three courses would be accept<lb/>able to her: (1) Whether she would like to go to Germany to further her musical education; (2) whether the state of her health was such as to make it desirable that she should go to a colony suitable for restoring her health; (3) whether she would prefer to go to a lady's home which Lord Salisbury knew of in London, in order to continue or recreate a musical con<lb/>nection. These propositions or suggestions I laid before Miss Sheehan, and she decisively refused to wind up her pecuniary affairs, and therefore the interview was without result. The winding up of her affairs did not necessitate her becoming a bankrupt, as her solicitor said a compromise would be accepted. There was then a firm of Sworder and Longmore, who were looking into her affairs, and her liabilities were stated to be about £300.</p>
               <p>At the request of the prisoner, the printed documents were placed before the jury.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, in addressing the jury, desired to record her con<lb/>viction of the absolute truth of what she had published, and to plead justification. For some 14 years she had been the victim of a loathsome libel and of a conspiracy afterwards found necessary to support that libel. The plot and the libel could not be separated without justice, and to refuse to hear one and not the other was to stifle the truth. With her own ruin had been involved the ruin of her husband, a clergyman of irre<lb/>proachable character and a graduate of Cambridge, with cruel sufferings to many others because they had stood up for justice and truth. For 14 years she had tried to get into Court, but</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110126"/>
               <p>had not been able to find a counsel who would come into Court, nor could she afford to pay one. She had therefore no alterna<lb/>tive but to take the step of publishing this libel to vindicate her own honour and that of her husband. Prisoner proceeded to recount the story of her dismissal in 1889. She admitted that in 1891 she was in pecuniary difficulties and applied to Lady Salisbury for help. In July, 1892, she received libellous letters from the chief constable of Hertfordshire and Superin<lb/>tendent Parrish, stating that she had been seen with the Rev. Mr. Edwards at Liverpool Street when he was flying from justice. With regard to the Rev. Mr. Stanley, at the time the became engaged to him he was expecting the living of St. John's, Eastbourne, and knowing Lord Salisbury she applied to him to use his influence with the Duke of Devonshire, the patron. She also applied for assistance in respect of a school she under<lb/>took, which, however, was not successful.</p>
               <p>(Evidence called for the defence.)</p>
               <p>Superintendent <hi rend="smallCaps">JAMES PARRISH</hi>, formerly superintendent of the Hertfordshire Constabulary, in answer to prisoner. I wrote you a letter in 1892 by reason of information I received in making inquiries about the Rev. Mr. Edwards. Mr. Edwards went away on June 10 or June 11. I was not with him at nine o'clock on the night he went.</p>
               <p>Prisoner said she complained that her name had been coupled with that of Mr. Edwards, and handed a letter to the Common Serjeant, who, having read it, said it did not bear upon the case at present.</p>
               <p>In further examination, witness denied that he was asked by the late Lord Salisbury to get Edwards out of the way. Witness tried to catch him.</p>
               <p>Colonel <hi rend="smallCaps">DANIELS</hi>, Chief Constable of Hertfordshire. I pro<lb/>duce a warrant for the arrest of the Rev. Mr. Edwards. I did not go to see Mr. Edwards on Saturday, June 11, and warn him to escape. I knew a warrant had been applied for on the Friday or Saturday, but had been refused.</p>
               <p>Rev. <hi rend="smallCaps">WILLIAM JOHN LAWRANCE</hi>, Dean of St. Albans. I was not with Edwards on June 11, 1892, when he escaped. I was at St. Albans. I did not see Edwards. I did not go with Colonel Daniell or Superintendent Parish.</p>
               <p>Rev. Lord <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT WILLIAM ERNEST GASCOYNE CECIL</hi>, Rector of Hatfield. I remember Edwards, and that I once took his duty. I cannot say whether that was on Sunday, June 12, after he had escaped.</p>
               <p>Q. You are aware that I had a letter from Parish on July 17? The Common Serjeant told prisoner that she must not ask witnesses about other people's letters.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110127"/>
               <p>Prisoner. I want to prove that I appealed to the Cecil family for truth and justice in this case long before I took this step.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. You must confine your questions to the two material points in the case, which are (1) Did you pub<lb/>lish this libel? (2) If so, can you prove the truth of the imputa<lb/>tions contained in them? I am not going to have the time of the Court wasted with irrelevant matter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Is not my liberty more important than time? I want to ask witness about some letters that he wrote to my husband. If I cannot have a fair trial I may as well give it up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that Lady Gwendolen has confessed her guilt to Mrs. Beer in 1897? A. Certainly not; the idea is pre<lb/>posterous. Q. You know that I have been absolutely ruined by this? A. No; I know nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner mentioned the names of three witnesses who the said had been properly subpoenaed. Mrs. Rachel Beer, Mrs. St. Hill, and the Bishop of Chichester were then called, in the Court and within its precincts. Neither answered.</p>
               <p>Rev. <hi rend="smallCaps">ROBERT BUTTON</hi>, Archdeacon of Lewes, sworn.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask witness whether, in consequence of ay being the scapegoat for Lady Gwendolen, he refused my husband's work for ten years.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant That has nothing to do with the case.</p>
               <p>Prisoner repeated the question. Witness was directed by the Common Serjeant not to answer it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">PRISONER</hi> then elected to give evidence on oath, and was ac<lb/>cordingly sworn.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant. Is your name Matilda Lavinia Stan<lb/>ley? A. Yes. Q. What are the facts yon wish to state on oath? A. All the facts I have stated so far. You have not given me a fair chance, because my witnesses are not allowed to answer. Some are not here, and some have not been called. Q. You are in the witness-box to give evidence as to facts; the only fact you have stated yet is that your name is Matilda Lwinia Stanley. Do you wish to state any other facts? A. What facts does your lordship mean? Q. Any facts which are material. A. I have already told the jury that I am a scape<lb/>goat for Lady Gwendolen Cecil; that I am a ruined woman and my husband a ruined man. The Archdeacon's evidence is ab<lb/>solutely stifled by the Court. If I had not done this I had nothing but death in front of me, slow torture, and—well, murder—deprived of everything that is worth living for. Q. Is that all you wish to state? A. Well, I think it is a very great pity; it has been a very great deal to me and to every<lb/>body connected with me, and I would ask for the most full investigation of this infamous conspiracy. That is all I wish to say.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110128"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gill. I cannot say how much money I have had from Mrs. Bray. I have had no account. It would be a pretty considerable sum, I dare say, over £200. She is certainly one of the persons I describe as having been ruined I cannot say how much I have had from Mrs. Pozzy or Mrs. Trigg, or Mrs. Thorpe, or Mrs. White. These are the people I have referred to as "saints of the Lord "; they are all very saintly in the highest sense.</p>

                  </hi>, farmer, Rhodes Farm, Mill Hill, Hendon. On August 18 I left the "Adam and Eve," at Mill Hill, about 11.30 p.m. There were two men standing in the gateway next the public-house. After walking about 100 yards on my way home King ran up behind me and hit me with a bottle and knocked me down. Both men got on me and tried to rob me; they were feeling in my trousers pockets. They kicked me all about the legs. I heard one say, "Out him!"I holloaed out and they ran off. A policeman caught one and a soldier caught the other. When I got up I found that in feeling in my pockets they had undone my trousers. The blow with the bottle was behind my ear, and I had to go to a doctor and get the wound bound up.</p>
               <p>To Davis. I had no drink in the public-house except some ginger-ale. There was not a constable in the house with me drinking. At the police-station I did not say first of all that it was you who struck me and tried to rob me. I do not know whether the policeman or anyone saw that my trousers were undone.</p>
               <p>To King. I did not hit you first and cause you to drop the bottle. I did not speak to either of you. I know it was you who struck me, because you were 20 yards behind me and Davis was 50 yards. I did not close with you and in the scrimmage fall and cut myself on the broken bottle.</p>

He had gone about 200 yards when heard a smashing of glass and somebody calling "Murder—police!"I hurried up, when I saw prosecutor, who scrambled of off the ground and ran towards me. He complained that prisoners had struck him across the head with a bottle. I blew my whistle and went up to the prisoners. Davis said, "He attempted to strike my mate and I struck him." At the station, in reply to the charge, Davis repeated this. King made no reply. On returning to the scene of the assault I found the remains of the glass bottle produced. From the position of the pieces on the ground, I should say the bottle had not just dropped down, but had been struck against something.</p>
               <p>To Davis. I had not been in the "Adam sod Eve." I have never been in it I never take anything from a public-house. I cannot say that I saw that prosecutor's trousers were undone. He was perfectly sober at the time.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I and King were working at the Highwood Hill Nursery, on the making of a new road there. On this night we went into the "Adam and Eve" about 10.30. We each had two half-pints of beer. I then called for a pint of beer in a bottle. When we left the house, as I had a big parcel in a handkerchief, my week-end shopping, I stopped and gave the bottle of beer to King to carry. He put it in his right-hand pocket. Prosecutor passed us, mumbling something to himself. When he got about 20 yards down the road he stopped. King went on; I stopped to fill my pipe. Directly King got up to prosecutor the latter made a punch at him; the bottle of beer fell out of his pocket The two of them clinched together. I went towards them. Prosecutor was on top of King. I caught him by the jacket and pulled him off. He then shouted, "Police—murder!"A constable came up, and I told him what had happened. He took no notice. He asked prosecutor what was the matter. Prosecutor said that I, Davis, had hit him with a bottle.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. King's jacket was an old one, and when prosecutor struck him the bottle fell out of his pocket When they clinched prosecutor fell on the bottle; he was not struck at all. I did not tell the constable that prosecutor had struck my</p>

He must have fallen on the broken glass bottle. As we struggled on the ground, prosecutor twisted over on the top of me and Davis pulled him off.</p>

King confessed to having been convicted of larceny at Edgware Petty Sessions on May 9, 1906, in the name of Sands, with a sentence of seven days' hard labour. Police evidence showed that up to two years ago King had been a thoroughly respectable man, but had taken to drink and associated with convicted thieves. He had served in the Militia for six years, and was discharged this year with a character marked "Good." Davis had refused any account of himself.

At 9.35 a.m. I saw Walker leave the wharf with four cases on his trolley. I followed him to Brinsmead's Piano Works, Kentish Town, where he delivered three cases. He then returned to 40, Baltic Street, premises occupied by Norton, Abrahams, and Batley, where the remaining case was taken in. I went to get assistance and arrested Walker. On Monday, July 23, two days earlier, I had kept observation on Baltic Street. I saw Walker drive up with a single-horse trol<lb/>ley, with six cases on it, to No. 40. With the assistance of another man on his van and Batley he took two cases marked A 921 and 922. Walker then drove away with the remaining four cases to C. Evans and Co., in London Wall. He did not deliver anything there, but drove back to 40, Baltic Street, having been absent half an hour, received the two cases A 921 and 922 back on to the trolley, and delivered them to the proper consignees, Charles Bauer and Co., 2, Golden Lane. I saw Batley standing at the door of 40, Baltic Street. He did not assist in taking the cases in or out, but he stood at the door, evi<lb/>dently waiting for them. He was there all the time.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-Sergeant, City Police. On July 25 I kept observation on 40, Baltic Street with other officers. At 1.45 p.m. I went in. Walker was brought in by Detective Anderton I said, "We are police officers. Did you deliver this case here," pointing to the case on the floor in the back warehouse. He said, "No, you have made a mistake." I said, "Where is your delivery sheet?" He said, "I have not got one." I said, "You do not deliver goods with<lb/>out one. He said, "I have not got one." At that time Detective Prior was outside looking alter the van. I called him into the warehouse, and said in the presence of the prisoner, "Is this the carman that you saw deliver this case here?" Prior said "Yes" and I again said to Walker, "Where is your delivery sheet?" Waller said, "I have not got one." I then put my hand beneath the bib of his apron and Walker took out the delivery sheet produced, torn in two pieces, which bean on the face of it the name and address of the consignee of the case, L.S.S., 11,728, and a description of its contents. Half the delivery sheet is given up to the consignee, and he signs the other half.</p>

                  </hi>, Inspector, City Police. On July 25 I went with other officers to 40, Baltic Street. I saw Walker walking away as we entered. Norton, Abrahams, and Batley were in the front warehouse. In the back warehouse I saw case L.S.S. 11,728. I said to Norton, "What is that case doing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110132"/>
               <p>here." He said, "I know nothing about it. If my servant put it there I cannot help it," referring to Batley. I told him he would be charged, and he said, "I know nothing about it at all." I told Abrahams he would be charged, and he said, "I know nothing about it; we were out at the time." Batley was there all this time. He said, "I saw the case there when I came back from dinner. I do not know how it came there, neither do I know who opened it." When I got there the case was partly nailed up after being opened. In the front ware room I found 18 bundles of pants without wrappers, and on the second floor wareroom I found four bundles in wrappers. I opened the case and found that a number of parcels had been abstracted, the wrappers of the 18 parcels being put back. Mr. Chambers afterwards identified the case.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a weekly servant to Norton and Abrahams, and I get a weekly wage. As regards these cases which were brought before me, I know nothing whatever about them. My work is making mat baskets, and I am on the first floor making mat baskets for orders which come in from the customers. As regards these cases, I know nothing at all about them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The only goods I take in are bundles of matting, which I open, and the girls carry them upstairs. I cut the matting to different sizes for the girls to make into baskets on the first floor. That is the only business that I am aware of that Norton and Abrahams carry on. If any other business is carried on I know nothing whatever about it I have never seen any other business carried on. I am paid £1 a week. There are five girls employed on the first floor. No one works on the second floor that I know of. I never go up there. The bales of mate are stored in the back warehouse. They are packed up in roils, sheets of mats. On July 25 I was in the warehouse with Norton and Abrahams when the detec<lb/>tives came in. I had just come back from dinner that minute.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110133"/>
               <p>I never saw Walker, and do not know him, and had never seen him on the premises at all. There are no workmen on the around floor of any kind. I was out at dinner when the case was delivered, and saw it there when I came in. I had never seen a packing case there before. I never saw the bundles of underclothing till the police pulled them out. I have been employed there about eight months. I am 36 years of age.</p>
               <p>Verdict: Walker, guilty of stealing 600 pairs of pants; Bat<lb/>ley, not guilty of receiving same.</p>
               <p>The indictment against Kerby and Fountain for stealing, and Norton and Batley for receiving, 111/2 dozen skirt knickers, was then taken.</p>

Fountain was with him in the street near the van, and I afterwards identified him. Kerby said to me, "I cannot take this signature, I shall get the sack." "Well," I said, "that is the condition of the cases and that is the signature you will get." He said, "Let me take the cases back?" I said, "No, you have got the signature and I have got the cases." The bands on the outside were intact, except that at the end of the case it was practically open. At they were shooting off the case the end would go in from the</p>

                  </hi>, detective, City Police. On Monday, July 23 I saw Kerby leave Miller's Wharf at about 8.20 a.m, and go up Tower Hill, driving a horse and trolley, with 15 cases on it. He stopped outside the Czar's Head public-house in Great Tower Street, entered it, and came out with the prisoner Fountain. They both got on the trolley and drove to Alder<lb/>manbury, and delivered some cases, then drove to New Union Street, along Fore Street, and to William Stern's, 7, Monkwell Street, and delivered some cases at each place. They then went to Norway Street, where there is a side entrance to 40, Baltic Street, and put the case S.S. 2459 on the footway. Batley and Norton came out of the side door; Batley in his shirt sleeves. The case S.S. 2460 was then placed on the top of the other and the two taken into the warehouse by Norton. Ballsy, fountain, and Kerby, who all assisted. They were very large cases. A third case was taken from the trolley in the same way by the four men, and taken into the warehouse for a few minutes, and then put back on the trolley. Kerby went in with Batley and Norton, and then came out and drove alone to Cheapside. where he delivered a case. An hour afterwards he returned to Golden Lane, a turning running into Baltic Street. He left his trolley and stood on the kerb, and Batley came up and spoke to him, and returned to Baltic Street. Kerby then drew his horse and van round to the side door in Norway Street and then Batley Norton, fountain, and Kerby replaced the two cases S.S. 2459 and 2460 on the trolley. All four assisted in putting them on the trolley. Fountain and Kerby then drove away with the trolley to the Fore Street Warehouse Company's premises in Milton Street. These two cases were delivered at Venning, Williams, and Douglas's premises, Cannon Street, Fountain assisting. After the cases were delivered they crossed the road, went into a public house and, after a short time, got on the trolley and drove to the Netherlands Wharf. I was behind them the whole time. On July 25, with Detective Walton, I went to Netherlands Wharf, Lower Thames Street, where I saw the prisoner Kerby. I told him we were police officers, and should arrest him for stealing part of the contents of two cases which he left at 40, Baltic Street, on the 23rd, and afterwards took to Venning, Williams and Douglas in Cannon Street. He said, "Yes. I went there; I took the cases to Venning, Wil<lb/>liams and Douglas, and the people complained of the cases being damaged. They very nearly got me into trouble, and I wanted to take them back again." On the way to the police station Kerby said to me, "I may as well tell the truth, sir. I left the case there. I did not take anything out of them. I shall plead guilty to it. There was a man named Fountain with me'</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110135"/>
               <p>At 7.30 a.m. I saw Fountain at Netherlands Wharf. I said, "We are police officers, and shall arrest you for being con<lb/>cerned in stealing a part of the contents of two oases which were left at 40, Baltic Street, on Monday." He said, "Yes, I was with Kerby, but I left him in Norway Street. I did not go any where else with him. I was with him two or three hours, that is all, on Monday?</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Batley. I saw you there on the days in question. I am quite sure I saw Batley on the Monday, assist<lb/>ing. On the Friday previous I saw Batley, but he did not assist in taking the cases in or taking them out.</p>

                  </hi>, fish porter, 7, Monteagle Street, Stepney. I have known the prisoner to speak to. On August 7 I was with two other men in High Street, Stepney, when I met the pri<lb/>soner with his barrow. I said, "Hullo, Mike!"which is the name I know him by. We were talking together, and we started larking and wrestling in a friendly way. My two friends had gone away. After wrestling for two or three minutes I saw something sharp on my face. I put my hand up and saw it was all full of blood. I went across the road, and I do not remember any more; I fell down. I was attended to at the hospital, and I have marks of a wound on my face. At the hospital the next day I found my coat had been cut. My two friends had gone right away when I went up to prisoner. It is untrue that I had ever tried to rob him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I came out of a public-house just before I met you. I was not turned out or expelled from the public-house. I did not rob you or kick you. I did not split your lip. I had been in the public-house two minutes and had had two or three drinks during the afternoon.</p>

                  </hi>, 20, Ernest Street, Stepney, fish porter. On August 7 I was in the "Crown" public-house in High Street, when I beard a bit of a row and walked out. I saw Morris walk towards the prisoner in a kind of wrestling attitude. The</p>

               <p>prisoner threw his hand round, and I saw Morris's coat was cut at the back. I shouted out, "I think he has got a knife—come away." I saw the knife in prisoner's hand. Prisoner walked towards Morris again and struck him down the face. Morris was walking towards the prisoner. I saw the blow on the face. I never saw anything in the prisoner's hand. I took Morris to the doctor's.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not see Morris strike you on the lip at the time you cut him on the nose.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. I thought they were merely playing as Morris walked towards prisoner. Morris had his hands down.</p>

                  </hi>, P.C. 312 H. At about six p.m. on August 7 I saw the prisoner in Stepney Green with a barrow, and told him I should take him into custody for stabbing the prose<lb/>cutor. He said, "I done it in self-defence." I took him to the station, where he handed me the blade of a knife produced and said, "This is what I done it with. I done it to save my life." I saw a cut on prisoner's nose and on his lip. The cut on the nose was slightly bleeding. He said. "They done this." I should say the cut on the nose could have been done with the fist.</p>

                  </hi>, House Surgeon, London Hospital. On August 7 prosecutor was brought to the hospital. He had an incised wound on the face, commencing at the inner side of the right eye, running right across the nose, cutting into the septum of the nose and through the cartilages on the left side, through the left nostril, through the upper lip, and tailing off on the lower lip on the left side of the mouth. It was a serious wound, but not a dangerous one, and could have been inflicted with the blade of a knife produced. It must have been used with a considerable degree of violence to have cut through to the bones of the nose. Prosecutor was in the hospital about 12 days. He is all right now, but there will be a permanent scar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It was not done by a thrust of the knife—it was a cut I should think.</p>
               <p>Statement of Prisoner before the Magistrate. I was knocked down by Morris and his two friends, kicked, and robbed. I did it to save my own life.</p>

                  </hi> (Prisoner, on oath). About five p.m. on August 7 I was coming along High Street, Stepney, when prose<lb/>cutor and two more men attacked me, knocked me down, kicked me, and robbed me; they did not leave me a penny. what I regained my feet he first gave me a kick and then struck</p>

               <p>me on my lip and cut it. I can show the marks on my hip and shins where they kicked me. I held out the knife as prose<lb/>cutor came towards me and cut him on the nose. I was knocked completely aghast when I did it. That is all I have to say About it They robbed me of 2s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The 2s. was in coppers—it was all in one pocket I got 5d. back by a little girl picking it up in the street and giving it to me. I have known Morris some time, and when I have met him he hat started taking liberties with me. Three men attacked me. Morris led the attack and the other two assisted him. They knocked me down and kicked me. The men that were there shouted, "Are you going to kill the man?" I got up. It was after I got a kick in the shin I used the knife. We were both standing up. Morris persisted in striking me. Morris did not use a knife to me; he used his leg. Neither of the other men used a knife to me. I wanted to go away.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. The prosecutor hat taken liberties with me and thrown dirt upon me. In Billingsgate he is constantly annoying me. I was frightened of him, and single-handed. All three of them came all of a sudden, and took me unawares, knocked me down and kicked me, and took every penny from me. They very nearly threw my barrow through a window. They did it to do as they liked. They knocked me about as if I was a dog. I was frightened of. them, and I got my knife out. I thought it would deter him, and when he made a stroke at me I held it out. He split my lip. I had my knife out before. He struck me in the month and kicked me on the shin. There is the mark of a kick there now for anyone to see. I have got another kick in the arm The doctor of Brixton Prison made a careful inspection and a note of every mark on me.</p>
               <p>The Detective-sergeant stated from inquiries that the prosecu<lb/>tor and other portert in Billingsgate Market were in the habit of teasing or "ragging" the prisoner. Verdict,

On the, 13th I asked him what he was doing. He said, "I have got plenty to do to make everything clean, as the Royal Family will arrive." He was using a feather broom like this. (Produced.)</p>

On August 14 I armed at 8.55, when I saw two velvet cases of Mr. Palttoho't lying on the ground, similar to this (produced). One blue frame and one bright velvet. There was also an iron bar and a feather duster. The velvet cases drew my attention to the box, and I found a window was open tad the other velvet cases disarranged and the contents gone.

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I have pleaded guilty to stealing this jewellery and am prepared to tell the truth. I am a Hungarian, and have been here three years. I was two years ago imprisoned for nine months for another theft. I have known Rosenberg about a year. I have never seen him working. I was living with a young woman named Day at No. 5, Eustace Road, Walham Green, where I had been since January. Rosenberg came to see me outside the Exhibition sometimes. The night before the robbery he put a letter in my letter-box. He suggested the robbery to me 10 or 15 days before. He said, "How easy it would be to get the jewellery the Earl's Court Exhibition "; and after he came to me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110140"/>
               <p>nearly every day. I said, "I cannot do it, because I have got a good wage "; I was getting 40s. He kept on coming to me and urging me. I saw him once or twice at the dinner hour. The Sunday before the robbery I saw him by the Albert Memorial, when I arranged for him to meet me at the Exhibi<lb/>tion the next morning at 7.45. I had then agreed to do it. I do not know what I was going to get out of it. He said he would go over to America and sell it there. I was not to go with him. I met him on Monday morning at the corner of Eustace Road. We both went to the Exhibition; I went in while he waited, but I would not do anything, and I told him I would not touch anything in the Exhibition; I was leading an honest life. I was sure I would be caught, and people were there. I told him I would meet him again at 11. I did not do so, and got a letter from him at night. I threw it away. It was asking me if I would do the robbery, and write a letter to the General Post Office when I had done it. I sent a letter the next morning after the robbery, asking him to meet me at 12 on Saturday outside the Post Office. When I committed the robbery there was no one about. I saw Czerny; he went out I took the jewellery, put it in my pocket, and walked out. There were no police about. I then went to the General Post Office and waited till one o'clock. Resenberg did not come. I then went over with the jewellery to Thompson's shop. He is a general dealer. I stopped there till four o'clock with the jewellery. Only Mrs. Thompson was there. I had met George Thompson in Winchester Prison, and he then told me when I got anything to dispose of I could take it to his place. At Thompson's I was there introduced by Mrs. Coles to "Old Jack." He took me to one of Lyons' shops in the City, where I met four, other men. I handed the jewellery over to "Old Jack," and he handed it over to the other men. They paid me £100 in gold. They promised to meet me the next day. I afterwards gave £10 to "Old Jack/' and Mrs. Coles had £2. George Thompson bad £70. I got £11 out of it. Mrs. Thomp<lb/>son had £2. I then bought a bicycle to go to Brighton, and another one to come back with. When arrested I had 8s. in my pocket. I never saw anything of these men again or of Rosen<lb/>berg.</p>

                  </hi>. I first met Mullender when we were both employed in the same house, 57, Lexham Gardens. I have known him 15 months. I was cook there, and he was kitchen porter; it was a boarding house. I ultimately lived with Mul<lb/>lender at 5, Eustace Road, Walham Green, until August 14. Rosenberg came to 57, Lexham Gardens, every night when we were living there; he would see Mullender, and stop about half an hour; they seemed to be great friends. I had not heard anything of the robbery before it was committed. He left home earlier than usual on August 14, and never came back. I next saw Rosenberg the following Saturday, the 18th, between one and two p.m. He came to Eustace Road, and said in English, "Do you know where Mullender is?" I do not speak German. I said, "No, I wish I knew where he was "; he said he would try to find him, and thought he was down at Brixton. I knew the Thompsons lived near Brixton. Sergeant Burney came to my house between the 14th end 18th, and searched it. I then learnt Mullender had been arrested. I did not know he was a thief. Rosenberg told me he wanted him about the diamonds. He had promised to meet Mullender outside the Exhibition on Monday, and could not meet 'him there, so he could not take the diamonds—he had overslept himself. Mullender was going to give him the diamonds to sell. A few minutes after he left became back and said the "tecs" were outside, and that he had told them to go to Hampstead. Mullender told me he had met Rosenberg in Hyde Park, and had arranged to steal the jewellery. I did not believe him.</p>

                  </hi>, Police-Sergeant, D. Rosenberg came to my house, 7, Hampstead Road, about 12 on August 17. I know him. He said, "I have a good job for you, Sergeant King. I know who stole the jewellery from Earl's Court Exhibition, and I think I can find the man for you. He is somewhere about Brixton, and if I can see his wife no doubt I shall get more particulars, and be able to find him for you." I said, "Very well, we will go and see Inspector Stockley." Rosenberg said, "Do you think I may get into trouble?" I said, "Are yon on the job?" He said, "No; but it is ft friend of mine who has done it." I said, "Then that accounts for my seeing you out<lb/>side the Exhibition at 11 at night the commencement of this month. I talked to him in German. He said, "Yes." I said, "I can't do anything behind Mr. Slockley's back. We must go and see him. You had better come with me," and eventually he did. On the 20th he saw me at Tottenham Court Road Police Station. I told him Mullender was in custody, and I Mid, "From what I have heard you have not told me the troth. I believe you are on the job, and I am going to take you to Kensington Police Station. I caution yon to be careful what you say." He said, "Do you think I shall get into</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110142"/>
               <p>trouble? I have been seen so often with my friend, and if the porter at the Exhibition sees me I am done." He was then taken to the station and confronted with Mullender, and Mul<lb/>lender said, "This is the man who caused me to steal," and, turning to Rosenberg, he said, "If you had not constantly pressed me to take the jewels I should not have done it. It was you I was going to take the things to and you were going to get rid of them." Rosenberg said, "I admit I know all about the job, but when you say I misled you you are wrong. It was you who proposed it." Rosenberg sent me to Hampstead when he evidently knew Mullender was at Brixton.</p>
               <p>Rosenberg. Do you think if I had participated in the job I would have come to you? A. Had the job succeeded and you had obtained the jewellery, or had been on the spot when the other man came along, I should not have heard anything of you.</p>

                  </hi> (Prisoner, on oath). I met Mullender about 12 months before. He said he wished to go back to Budapest, and that he had been in England a year. I lost sight of him for about six months, and when I met him again he told me he worked at the Earl's Court Exhibition as porter, and invited me to go and see him after closing time. I told him I was very badly off and starving. He said, "Come to me, and I will give you something to assist you." I called and saw his wife, and said I would wait for him outside the Exhibition. I met him, and we arranged to meet again, when he would give me something. I met him, and he said, "To-day is my ten day. Come here at four p.m. Perhaps I will give you some<lb/>thing." I met him and he said, "I am very sorry," and gave me a few pence, and told me to go again in the evening. On Monday evening I saw him again. I wrote him, "I will not come no more to see you. I must also try to find employment, when if you wish to see me then write me a letter addressed to the General Post Office," and then I went away all the rest of the time. On the Tuesday morning I went to the library at 8.30 or 9, and conversed with some acquaintances till 5 p.m. Then I went to the Post Office for my letters, and received a letter, "Am waiting for you next the General Post Office." I chucked it away and waited, and saw nobody, and went away. King and Stockley allowed me to see Caroline Day on condi<lb/>tion that I should get information about Mullender. I never incited him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I did not know he was going to steal the jewellery, nor did I till Day had arranged to meet him after the robbery. I did say I had arranged to take the things to America to sell because I wanted to know Mullender's ad<lb/>dress. I knew he had made a friend in prison formerly who could get rid of diamonds. I told King I knew who had stolen</p>

                  </hi>,111, Fentiman Road, Clapham. I am a German, and in the month of January last was looking for some employment. I came to this country at the beginning of November in last year to pick up business habits and the language. I am in receipt of an allowance from my relatives in Germany. In January I saw the advertisement produced in the "Daily Telegraph" and in a German paper, wherein pri<lb/>soner advertised from Chichester House, Chancery Lane, as. Krause and Co., that he gave legal advice and obtained loans. I went to the address advertised. The name over the door was German Law Institute. I saw prisoner and asked him for a loan of £25, and said that if he could not do that a smaller sum would do. I told him I had lost my situation and I only wanted the loan until my money came over from Germany. He asked me for security, and I gave him a reference to my people in Germany. He asked a preliminary fee of 2s. 6d. for making inquiries. I called several times, but did not get any money. One day he took me to Finch's wine bar and said he wanted a young man who knew German, and I thought I might find a situation. Speaking of the loan, he said he wanted another security. Shortly after I received money from Germany, and I told him the loan did not matter. I showed him my certifi<lb/>cates</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110144"/>
               <p>from some places where I had been, and he said I would be the right man for him. He suggested that I should come for several days and see what was to be done, and he would dictate me some letters. I went nearly every day for three weeks. Some of the letters I took in shorthand and some I wrote. I told him I should write for all my money from Ger<lb/>many, and he said I could take a half-share in the business. He said, "I have a splendid business. I give loans, I sell patents, I have connection with every bank in London and can control any amount." He said, also, that he wrote letters for the Ger<lb/>man Consul in London. Prisoner wanted to insure my life in the New York Life Insurance. The agent asked me what my income was, and prisoner said £10 a week. Prisoner said we could borrow money on the policy and lend it out, and that in his last place in the City Road he earned a lot of money. With regard to his office, he said, "This furniture alone cost me £100, and the rent is paid a quarter in advance." I decided to buy a half-share in the business, and paid £200 on March 6, and an agreement was entered into between us, post-dated March 16 for the purpose of being stamped. After that I took up my position in the office and went every morning and remained until five o'clock. For the first day or two prisoner was there all day, then he used to go away in the morning and return in the evening, sometimes drunk. There was no genuine business at all. There was sometimes 2s. 6d. or 5s. paid for inquiries in respect of a loan. The loans were made from my own private money. As to the patents, prisoner used to write to people ask<lb/>ing them to send models, and then he said afterwards they must pay commission or the models would not be returned. One model was a patent for lighting gas by electricity, and one was for connections between engines. Another was coming as I went away. I remained there until July 4. About £100 of my money was advanced in loans to friends of the prisoner named Walter, Koch, schtze, kuhn, and Holtz. Some of the cheques given in repayment were dishonoured. After I left on July 4 I made complaint to the police, and a warrant was issued. I should not have parted with my money if I had known no business was done there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Before I came over here my last engage<lb/>ment. was in a lace Fabrik. In England, after being in a situa<lb/>tion about four weeks with an advertising agency in the City, where I had to translate reports. I left, as the manager did not pay me my salary. The prisoner's office was nicely furnished, and there were good chairs. Prisoner's wife was sometimes there. I did not expect he would advance the £25 until he knew something about me. I never did think there was any<lb/>thing dishonest in his obtaining the inquiry fee and did not expect to have it repaid. When I paid the money in March I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110145"/>
               <p>had bad an opportunity of seeing how the business was run. I saw the people who came in. Krause pointed out to me a man to whom he wanted to sell a shop. I believe he did endeavour to sell the shop. Krause said the business was not honest; it was a swindle, but that did not matter to him so long as he earned his commission. I am now 21, and have been in different busi<lb/>nesses since I was 16. It was generally after having wine at Finch's that prisoner made these rosy statements. Prisoner showed me a book of counterfoil receipts, and stated he had received such sums as 15 and 20 guineas at a time. I had asked to see some particulars of his business. He showed me also a day-book or diary, where he had put down the names of people who came and the commissions they paid. I did not say I liked the business, and asked him if he would take me in at partner. He offered to do so. I took the business for honest from what he told me. I really thought that a man who was doing thousands a year was prepared to take me in and divide the profits for a payment of £200. He said there would be thousands when we sold a patent, but that would not be every day, and that the loan business and the legal advice he gave paid the office expenses. He told me several times that I was the right man to do his business properly. The money lent was £36 to Walter, £30 to Koch, "£11 10s. to schutie, Kuhn, £36, £18 of which was found by Krause, and Holtz £30. Walter repaid £17, Kuhn £4, and that money was used in the business. I have sworn an information that I have been de<lb/>frauded. I have nothing in writing to show what representa<lb/>tions were made. Before applying for process at the police court I asked prisoner to give me my money back. I tele<lb/>phoned to him at Southend that I wanted to speak to him on an important matter. When he came back, I said to him, "Here is no business, and for my £200 I have nothing." He said business was very bad. I said, "Pay me my £200 back and we will be done with." He said, "Certainly, I will not rob you of your money." I then made him the proposal that he should give me £100, and for the other £100 a bill. He offered me £50 the day afterwards. When I was introduced to Mr. Harry Wilson, of Bow Street, he said it was a matter for a criminal court. When prisoner told me he did business with the German Consul in London he said it in German so that I could not understand it. He did not say he did business with a consul who was a German. Prisoner did write some letters for a Mr. Graesse, Consul in Uruguay. Graesse, who was stay<lb/>ing at Dover, received letters from a solicitor in Germany rela<lb/>tive to some divorce proceedings, and prisoner answered them like a secretary might. When I was with Krause he intro<lb/>duced people who came for loans to the Westminster Loan and Discount Company, which is a money-lending business. When I left the business I took such money as there was there. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110146"/>
               <p>do not recollect that it was £23. Krause and I used to lend each other money. At one time he was very short of money, and pawned some underclothing which I wanted to change at it did not suit me. I did not ask him to pawn them, and was not at the office that day.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When people came to the office Krause used to see them alone. I only knew what he told me.</p>
               <p>Vice-Consul <hi rend="smallCaps">BARON C. VON NEURATH</hi>, from the German Con<lb/>sulate, Finsbury Square. I attend the Consulate regularly. I know nothing of Krause or of the firm of Krause and Co. It is untrue that the German Consul in London is in the habit of sending persons to Krause and Co. to be advised on legal matters. I do not know Graesse. A Consul who is a German would not be the German Consul in London.</p>

                  </hi>, agent for Mr. William Henry Adams, landlord of Chichester House, Chancery Lane, stated that he let an office in the building furnished to prisoner on December 4 at a rent of £46 the first year, £48 the second year, and £52 the third year, the first quarter payable in advance, and afterwards as it became due. The rent had always been paid as it was applied for.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The furniture in the office was not worth £100, as it was furnished with old stuff. There was nothing very valuable.</p>

                  </hi>, greengrocer, 138, High Street, Merton. In January last I saw an advertisement in a German paper relating to loans. I wrote to prisoner, and afterwards went to see him. I asked prisoner for a loan of £10, but prisoner said he could not lend less than £30 on a bill of sale. The security was to be on my shop. I paid an inquiry fee of 5s., and he sent a man over to see my place. I did not get a loan nor my 5s. back.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Merton is the other side of Wimbledon, and prisoner sent a man over to look into the truth of my state<lb/>ments.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. My furniture and house are worth more than £30. I paid £100 for my business.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner's dishonoured cheques had since been taken up. or they would not have been in prisoners hands, I suppose. The total amount paid into the account was £157.</p>

                  </hi>, Inspector, E Division. I received a warrant for the arrest of the prisoner on July 12 and proceeded to Chichester House, Chancery Lane. I told him I was a police-officer and read the warrant. He said, "Do you say that he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110147"/>
               <p>(schubert) says that I obtained the money by false pretences? He is my partner." He afterwards said, "My cash-book shows that I have taken £60." I asked him if his cash-book was amongst the books I had taken, and he said, "It is with my counsel." meaning, probably, his solicitor. I took possession of a book of counterfoil receipts, showing that the amount taken was £7.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The date of the second application for rent it July 2. That has since been paid. Prisoner led me to infer that he was not surprised by my visit. A short time after his arrest prisoner was admitted to bail. Amongst the papers I found a large number relating to patents and patent rights.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rooth asked, this being the case for the prosecution, that his lordship would withdraw the case from the jury.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 361, Queen's Road, Battersea Park. I describe myself as a financial agent. I have been in England nine years, and have been engaged in this business about 21/2 years. I advertised in January last in a German paper circulating in England and in the "Telegraph" loans and German legal advice. I have advertised patents once: "German Legal Institute.—G. Kranie and Co. try to sell patents for England." Prosecutor came to me in consequence of the advertisement in the "Telegraph." He wanted a loan, and paid 2s. 6d. inquiry fee. He also asked me to write for what was owing to him, to his late employer. One morning at the end of January he told me he did not. want the advance. At the end of February he said he had nothing to do, and asked me whether I would like that he should come into the business. He said he liked my business, and was I willing to take him as a partner, In reply, I said I would not mind. Then he made a proposal. He wanted money from his aunt, but his aunt wrote to him that toe was a spendthrift, and he could not have any money. Then he drew a bill of exchange for 2,000 or 3,000 marks, and asked me to cash it for him. That represents about £150. I sent the bill to a German bank, and it came back dis<lb/>honoured. His aunt afterwards wrote that he could have his money, about £400, and in the middle of February she sent him the whole lot. I told him if he liked to be a partner he must pay £200. He never asked what the profits were. I told him the German legal business, and the money lending would pay the expenses, and if I was able to sell a patent we should have a big profit. At that time I was negotiating a loan for a German Prince for £60,000, and there would be a good commission. When he asked me the nature of the business I had transacted with clients, I told him. I did not make the statement that I bad a splendid business, sold patents, and made loans, had connection with every bank in London, and had control over</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110148"/>
               <p>any amount. I did not say I wrote letters for the German Consul. I said I wrote letters for Mr. Consul Graesse, who is a German, and Consul for Uruguay. I did not saw that the office furniture had cost £100. It appears on the face of agreement that the office was let furnished. I told him that a quarter was paid in advance, which was true. He paid me the £200 in German shares. We drew up the agreement on March 6; after<lb/>wards it was signed by solicitor Peters on March 16. After that he attended to the business, and after four weeks said he was very pleased with it. Koch had previously offered to become my partner. He was a German bank manager, and said he would buy out Mr. schubert, and asked me if he would go if he gave him £300. Prosecutor had full facilities for seeing all my papers, and the people who came to the office after he be<lb/>came a partner. Sums of money were advanced by us to Kuhn, Holtz, Koch, schiitze, and Walker. I was trying to sell a patent for £75,000, in which case I should have got £3,700 com<lb/>mission. I had also a patent to sell for supplying electric power to tramcars, which would have brought us in £1,000. Six years ago I was a partner in Vogler and Co., cigar importers. With that exception, I have never been known in business by any other name than Krause. With regard to the cheques that were dishonoured, I redeemed them afterwards with postal-orders. As to the clothes I pawned, they belonged to me, and they were pawned by me because schubert asked me for money. I also pawned a sovereign-case and a watch Which belonged to schubert. schubert had the money and the ticket too. At the time schubert left, taking with him the cash, £29 9s. 11d., he owed me £14. It is true that before he applied for the warrant he asked to have his money back. There was nothing in the agreement about that. He was to have it back because he did not like the business. I said, "All right, you can have your money back, out you must wait." He wanted £250. Then he made a proposal that I should give him £100 cash, £85 which I had lent out of my own pocket and a bill for the balance. The next thing was the arrest. Mr. Wilson telephoned to me to ask the name of my solicitor, as schubert was going to pro<lb/>ceed against me for fraud. After that I was, of course, not surprised to see the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never made advances myself. I got the money from the bank. I meant by the advertisement that I could get advances, not that I made them myself. As to the inquiries, the English Financial Corporation always want a re<lb/>port as to how people stand. The Corporation only grant loans of £30, but the London and Westminster Discount Company make loans from £5 to £20. I did not apply to the London and Westminster to advance money for schubert. As a matter of fact, at that time I had no money and no banking account. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110149"/>
               <p>had never had a banking account in this country before March 16, when I opened an account with £75 of schubert's money. I had one in Germany. People were not pressing me for money in February and March of this year. I was sued in the County Court for £6, but I only owed the man £4. I paid the money tad the man did not come into Court I told schubert when he applied for the advance that I should have to go to someone else for the money. I told him one of hit references war not satisfactory and he would have to get another. He gave a refer<lb/>ence to 111, Fentiman Road, but I inquired at 113, where a German waiter lives, who used to work at the Cafe l'Europe, and was told prosecutor was a man who did not pay his rent and was owing at the time about four weeks. I told him soon after the application I could not do the business. I had money from my marriage, but that was tied up by six months' notice. We never discussed what business I was doing. I simply told him that the money-lending and the German legal advice would pay the expenses. I studied German law at the Polytechnik in Berlin and am entitled to give legal advice in Germany. As to the suggestion that the money-lending business was a swindle, I got money from the Financial Corporation and the London and Westminster for over 100 people. I had a commission for in<lb/>troducing people, 21/2 per cent, from the London and westmin<lb/>ster, and 5 per cent from the Financial Corporation, and 5 per<lb/>cent, also from Mr. Gray, a private moneylender. My books show the commission received and the business I did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's books, in which he said the entries of commission, etc., were made, were produced, and examined by the Common Serjeant.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant observed that there were a number of entries which showed that some sort of business was going on. They could not have been concocted afterwards, because the police had possession of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination continued. I have never sold a patent. I have a patent of my own for a bicycle lock. I started the patent business only in January. I did not tell schubert I had a splendid business. I told him if we sold a patent he would soon have his £200 back. Koch, who borrowed £30, was ex<lb/>pecting to get 75,000 marks from America.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Koch was interested in the growth and pro<lb/>duction of rubber in America, and he expected to get 75,000 marks from his shares. Rubber has been doing very well. I thought he was a man who could find £300 if necessary. He used to be manager of the Leipzic Bank.</p>
               <p>The Common Serjeant pointed out that this was a case where two Germans were contradicting one another, and asked what there was upon which the jury could say that the prosecutor's story was corroborated.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110150"/>
               <p>Mr. Rooth submitted on the authority of Regina v. William<lb/>son (11 Cox, 328) that mere exaggeration of the value of a busi<lb/>ness did not justify indictment for fraud.</p>
               <p>After some discussion, it was left to the jury to say whether the case should proceed, and the jury expressed the opinion that the case should go right through. Mr. Frampton and Mr. Rooth addressed the jury.</p>

                  </hi>, Sergeant, D Division, said that these lads had all been to the came school. Frederick Barrow seemed to be the ringleader. Orris and McKenan were really brothers. The money taken at the church was mostly in notes. A num<lb/>ber of these had been recovered, as prisoners had been unable to get them cashed; some had been destroyed by them. Stanley, Orris, and Horace Barrow were willing to go to sea. Kite's father was anxious that he might be sent to sea in order that he might be under some discipline. With regard to Frederick Barrow, there seemed little doubt that he had got hold of some such publication as "Dick Turpin."</p>
               <p>Lieutenant <hi rend="smallCaps">BOSANQUET</hi>, secretary of the Marine Society, said the "Warspite" was for boys of good character only—in fact, they must be of blameless character. The Navy, of course, did not want boys who had got into trouble, but there were indus<lb/>trial training ships which would take boys who had committed minor offences, and reformatory ships for boys who had com<lb/>mitted more serious offences. The London County Council had a school at Feltham which admitted boys under the Industrial schools Act and a ship on the Thames at Purfleet, afterwards getting them places in the merchant service. There was also the "Cornwall" at Purfleet, which was managed by a committee and received a Government grant. The "Chichester" and "Arethusa," like the "Warspite," only took good boys.</p>

                  </hi> (through an interpreter). I am an engineer. In July last I was residing at 44, Canonbury Road; prior to that I was manager of the Neophone Company, at 149, Rosebery Avenue; Blau was in the same employment, under me. About May Blau introduced his brother-in-law, scheibe, to me for employment as a mechanic. In June Scheibe intro<lb/>duced Knight to me, saying that he was a secret official of the Ministry of War. On July 15 I took scheibe, his wife, and another lady, and Blau, to Woodford in my motor-car; it was numbered H 2929, and was worth £80 to £90. On the way the car broke down at Waltham Abbey. It was taken to a public-house close by, kept by Mr. Bartholomew, and left there. We all proceeded to The railway station; on the way I said to Blau that I must go back to find out the exact name and address of the people with whom the car had been left. I returned and saw Bartholomew. I speak very little English, but I showed him my papers, and eventually I got the car back. During July the car was kept at Foster's garage in Corsica Street. It was there on the night of July 21. I did not authorise anyone to take it away; on the contrary, I left instructions that it should not be given to anyone. The letter produced [on the headed paper of the Neophone Company, and purporting to be an order by witness for delivery of the car] is not in my writing. That paper has the address of the company, Rosebery Avenue; the company had removed to Worship Street in January. Knight had been a traveller for the company and would perhaps have some of the old stationery. I seem to know this writing; it is very similar to scheibe's. I have letters of his, not here, but at home. The car formerly had the number A.7B.U.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doherty. I was not on friendly terms with scheibe in July; he was always worrying me to find him work. scheibe wrote to me when he was recommending Blau; I have the letter at home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jarvis. I cannot prove that Knight was traveller to the Neophone Company, but I have been told so. When scheibe told me that Knight was a secret official of the Ministry of War, he spoke in German. Knight speaks some German. He was recommended to me in respect of a patent explosive shell; I am myself in negotiation with the English War Office as to a shell I have invented. This car of mine is constantly breaking down. I bought it second-hand, in May; it is a Darracq, two years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Dr. Gimblett. I have known Blau about three months; he was never employed at Rosebery Avenue. He was a mechanic. He speaks a little English.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a refreshment house at Wal<lb/>tham Abbey. On July 15 prosecutor came with Blau and scbeibe and some ladies when the car had broken down. scheibe did the talking. He asked if I could store the car for a day or two. I said, Yet, and that the charge would be It a day. He did not say to whom the car belonged. Later in the day prosecutor came to me; he satisfied me that he was the owner of the car, and I lot him take it away. An hour afterwards scheibe came. I told him his friend had called and fetched the car.</p>

                  </hi>, garage proprietor, 3 and 5, Corsica Street Prosecutor warehoused his car with me. On July 20, about 7.30 p.m., Knight and scheibe came to me. Knight re<lb/>presented himself as coming from scotland Yard, and said he was tracing Madaler in reference to a motor-car accident at Tooting. He questioned me as to when the car came to me aad expressed his doubt whether Madaler had a licence. I gave the required particulars, and the two men left. The car, which had been away for a week, came back that night. On the night of the 21st Blau brought a note, which was opened by my assistant and brought to me. Thinking the note came from Madaler I let the car go. Smith drove it away at the request of Blau. Blau spoke enough English to make himself understood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doherty. scheibe could not hear what Knight said to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jarvis. I knew scheibe as being with Madaler; I had not seen Knight before. It is not the fact that scheibe spoke to me first wanting particulars of an accident to a child, that I afterwards took Knight into my private office and gave him particulars, and that he then said, "I am not a detective, my occupation is a clerk. Why do you give me these particulars. "It was scheibe who introduced Knight, but it was Knight, not scheibe, who made inquiries about the car numbers. It. was Knight himself who said he was a detective. The conversation was in the private office, and scheibe was out<lb/>side. A number in red on a white ground is a trade number; white on black ground is the private possession number. Any<lb/>one may have a number assigned him who has a driving licence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Dr. Gimblett. Blau could speak English, but not much.</p>

                  </hi>,58, Canonbury Road. I am a motor car re<lb/>pairer, and sometimes do odd jobs at Foster's garage. I am able to drive a car. On the night of July 21, about 9.30, I was at the garage. Blau came in with a note. After Foster read the note I got certain directions from him. Then Blau requested me to drive the car, which I did; he spoke in broken English. He told me to drive to meet Mr. Madaler; he did not say when I was to drive to. I knew where Madaler lived, and I drove in the direction of Canonbury Road. Just down the street I saw Knight; I was crossing Corsica Street, slowing down, and he jumped into the car. He asked me if I was going to meet Madaler; I said, "Yes "; he said, "Well, you will have to go to Baker Street (Clerkenwell) to meet him." I had seen Knight before; I believed that he knew where Madaler was. When I got to Baker Street Knight told me to stop at a corner; he got down to meet a friend of his, and told me to wait; presently he came back and said, "We will wait for the long 'un," meaning scheibe; I had known scheibe before. When scheibe came I was directed to go to the "Bagnigge Wells." Knight went off, and I drove with scheibe to the "Bagnigge Wells." I stopped outside the public-house. Shortly after the potman came out and said the oar was to go into the public-house yard. The car was pushed inside; both Knight and scheibe were there then. Knight asked me what was Madaler's old number; I said, A.7B.U.; he went and got some cardboard and some red ink and a brush, and painted the number on the cardboard; this was done outside in the street. By scherbe's orders I removed the two number plates that were on the car, and the cardboard was put on. We had drink together, and then I went off, an appointment being made for me to meet Knight at the same place next morning. Later the same night the police came to me and inquired about the car, and I went with them and fetched the car away. On the 22nd I went to keep the appoint<lb/>ment with Knight; I did not tell him the police had been to me. I went to his house at his request, and he showed me the two cards produced. We went to the public-house; the police were there, and Knight was arrested.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Doherty. I have known Madaler a long time; I was at the firm from whom he bought this car. On July 21 I had been at the garage all the day; I was doing nothing there. I knew very well where Madaler lived. When scheibe came up, in Baker Street, he did not express surprise at seeing me and Knight; I did not ask him to come on the car; I did not ask him to come and have a drink. Knight told scheibe to direct me to the "Bagnigge Wells." I had never before taken the car for Madaler to that public-house; I did not ask the people there whether Madaler had arranged for the car to be stored there. I placed the number A.7B.U. on the car under Knight's directions. It was Knight or scheibe who told</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110155"/>
               <p>me to take of the number plates already on. I did not give the potman a shilling or any tip at all. It is not true that when I saw the police I was rather nervous, and thought I would save my skin. I made the appointment to met Knight the next morning; I had no idea that there was anything wrong. I cannot say with what object we were to meet; I was looking perhaps to be paid by Knight or Madaler or someone for driving the car.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jarvis. When I met Knight I was slowing down, crossing a turning; I did not ask him to go for a drive. He said, "Are you going to meet Mr. Madaler?" I said, "Yes "; then he said, "You have to meet him at Baker Street." When I got to Baker Street and did not meet Madaler I dad not know what to think, but I had taken my instructions from Knight. I know Madaler well; I have done repairs for him; he does not owe me money. I do not know what was Knight's object in altering the registration number on the car; I did not think there was anything wrong. When I unscrewed the old plates I did not take them away in my pocket Knight took them. I have heard that his place has been searched and the plates not found. I have no idea where they are. I swear I did not take them. The appointment I made to meet Knight on the following morning was not. with a view to taking him for a drive. This car was always breaking down. On the short journey on the night of July 21 it broke down two or three times; it had to be pushed into the public-house yard. I did not say to Knight, "We will take off this plate and put on the old manufacturer's plate, because the police will not grumble so much if we have breakdowns." I had no idea of stealing the car. I do not know what Knight's idea was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Dr. Gimiblett. I swear that Blau told me in broken English to drive the car away.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I knew scheibe to be a friend of Madaler's, or thought he was, so that I believed the whole affair to be bona<lb/>fide.</p>

I sent the potman to see about it; I did not myself see the car then. At four o'clock the next morn<lb/>ing the police came and took the car away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jarvis. I have been at the "Bag<lb/>nigge Wells" ten years, and Knight has been in the neighbour<lb/>hood all that time. I thought he was all right. He told me the car had broken down.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110156"/>
               <p>who was with Smith, in King's Cross Road. I told Knight we were police-officers, and would arrest him for being concerned with two other men in stealing a motor car. He said, "I never sole the car; I could not drive it. Ask him," pointing to Smith. We took Knight to the police-station. About 11.30 I went to 5, Cauonbury Square, where I saw scheibe and Blau. I said to them, "We are police-officers, and shall arrest you for being concerned with another man, in custody, in stealing a motor car by means of this note," showing them the note. scheibe said, "We wanted to force him to pay us." Blau said, "l know nothing." On being charged at the police-station, scheibe said, "All right." Knight said, "Does Madaler know what he is doing?" Blau, through an interpreter, said, "The paper was given me by Knight, and I delivered it." Blau is scheibe's brother-in-law. (Witness, who said he had had con<lb/>siderable experience in judging handwriting, was handed a letter written by Knight and the note taken by Blau to the garage. He pointed out what he considered to be similarities between letters in the two documents.)</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. (To the Court.) I am certain I am not indebted to scheibe or Knight. I cannot ex<lb/>plain why scheibe said to the officer, "We wanted to force him to pay us." Eight days before I lost the car scheibe made a claim upon me for 4s. for a cab-fare that he said he had paid for me; I would not have anything to do with him, as he was so impertinent. That is the only claim he has ever made against me. I did owe Smith something, but I paid him, and on July 21 I owed him nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jarvis. I owed Smith money for work done and for rubber; I believe it was 40s. or 50s. I did not pay him all at once; I paid him £1, then 10s. then £1. I am quite certain that on July 21 I owed him nothing.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I have been in England about three years. I am a mechanical engineer. This is the first time in my life I have been charged with any offence. I never made a claim on prosecutor for 4s.; he never owed me any money. When the two officers came to me I did not know that they were policemen; I thought Smith was coming on account of the money that Madaler owed him, and that the two men with him were going to help him to recover it; that ac<lb/>counts for what I said to them. On July 21 I had been out shopping. I had promised to go that night to a Mr. Joyce, at 45, Baker Street, to pay him money I owed him, and give him some photographic apparatus I had repaired for him. I had got within two doors of Joyce's house when I saw Smith and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110157"/>
               <p>Knight and the motor-car; the meeting was auite accidental. I said to Smith, "What are you doing here "; he said they had had a breakdown with the car. Knight said, "We are going to put the car up at the 'Bagnigge Wells,' as I am very well known there." Smith said, "Come along and have a drink,' ana I consented, as I thought I might meet Joyce at the public-house. At the "Bagnigge Wells" I gave them a hand in shov<lb/>ing the car into the yard. I saw Smith unscrew the old plates; I could not make out why he did it, but it was no business of mine. After having a drink I went home, and that is absolutely all I know of this business. I never bad any intention of stealing the car or wronging the prosecutor in any way. The note produced is not in my writing; I do not recognise the writing; I never authorised anyone to write it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Jarvis. At the "Bagnigge Wells" I saw Smith give the potman a shilling; I say that on my oath. Smith paid for the drinks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lawless. I have known prosecutor three or four months. When I saw the numbers changed I had no notion that there was anything wrong on foot. Smith's statement that I was fetched by Knight and drove with him to Baker Street is untrue. I went to the public-house because Smith invited me. Smith is false when he says that I told him to go to the "Bagnigffe Wells." I did not hear anyone tell Smith to alter the numbers. I certainly did not write the note, nor did Blau; I know Blau's writing. I have no idea who wrote She note. I did know that a note was to be sent to the garage; I supposed it was on account of the money that Madaler owed Smith. Knight came to my house and asked me to take it; I was busy, and said, "My brother-in-law may as well go." Knight did not tell me what was in the note. I knew that Madaler owed Smith money; on July 12 or 13 Madaler had taken me to the garage to translate what he said to Smith. He paid him 10s., and said he could not pay him more then, but would pay him the remainder of the £2 10s. in one or two weeks' time; Smith said to me that he was very short of money, and could not I induce Madaler to pay him a bit more; I translated this to Madaler, who said, "Tell him I will pay him in one or two weeks' time." When Knight came to me on the 21st he said, "It's rather rough on Smith that he don't get his money," and he went on, "Will you take this note up to Smith's?" I tee now that the note is addressed to Mr. Foster; I did not look at it. Smith intended to sue Madaler, and I thought Knight was helping him in that connection. I have known Knight some time; up to Christmas, 1903, when I got married, I lived with him. I did go to the garage with Knight on the 20th. Knight wanted to meet Smith. I said, "He may be at the garage, let us go there." When we got there Knight went</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a traveller in seeds. I have known Scheibe all the time he has been in Eng<lb/>land; I did not know Smith until I was introduced to him by scheibe on July 21. Smith came up to us and I was introduced to him in the street. We adjourned to a public-house and had a drink together. A conversation ensued about Madaler owing Smith money. scheibe had told Smith that he knew a friend who had done County Court work and could help him to re<lb/>cover the money; I was this friend. We talked the matter over. I told Smith that, as the Courts did not sit in the Vaca<lb/>tion, if he sued he would not get paid till September, and that the best thing he could do was to consult a solicitor with the object of getting some kind of garnishee or lien on the car, at that was the only thing that he knew Madaler had that was worth anything. He then turned round and, as a kind of re<lb/>ward or compensation for my giving the advice, suggested that he would take me for a drive. He left me to go to the garage and fetch the car. Later on he returned on the car. He slowed up for me to get in. I told him I wanted to be driven home (to Baker Street (I live at No. 44), as it was too late at that time of night to go anywhere else. He drove on accordingly. There were several breakdowns. We had got to Baker Street, when there was another stop. Smith said there was something wrong with the spark plug and he must get a new one. Did I know where he could put the car up for the night. I said, "There is a friend of mine who has known me 10 or 12 years; he keeps a public-house just here; we will take it there. At the same time I shall tell him the car is yours, and that you will come for it in the morning." I went to the "Bag<lb/>nigge Wells" and got permission and the car was taken in. I saw Smith unscrewing the plates off the car. He said, "This old thing will attract a lot of attention; we will put on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110159"/>
               <p>trade numbers A 7B.U. in red on white ground, and the police will think it is a trial car." I saw Smith give the potman a hilling tip. Smith took away the plates he had unscrewed. I did not take them. The police have searched my house and have not found the plates. I met Smith next morning, with the object of going with him to the "Bagnigge Well." that I might vouch him as the party to whom to deliver the car, as I do not think Mr. Hunt had seen him. At to she note, I know nothing about it; the first time I saw it was at the West London Police Court; on my oath I dad not write it, or hand it to schceibe or Blau. On the 21st I handed no note of any description whatever. I have never had this car in my pos<lb/>session or control for a second. Foster is wrong in saying that I represented myself as a detective. I did not represent myself to prosecutor as a War Office official.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lawless. If I am asked to suggest the reason for the car being taken away and the number plates removed, I should say it was because Smith wanted to get the car for the money that was owing to him. I swear that it was at Smith's suggestion that I wrote the numbers on the card<lb/>board; I believe he said that if he had the old numbers on and the car continually broke down he would be summoned for obstruction. I did not say to Smith at Baker Street, "Wait while I go and fetch the long 'un." I do not know how Scheibe happened to come by just at that moment. I certainly should not go to Mr. Hunt's to put up a stolen car; he has known me 10 years; he changes cheques for me, and so on.</p>

                  </hi>, 12, Colchester Street, Bethnal Green. I have been in England eight weeks. I had something wrong with my eyes, and a man introduced me to the prisoner to cure my eyes. I told prisoner my trouble, and he said, "I shall cure you, and then you may proceed to Canada." I paid him 10 dollars. He attended me for three weeks, and said, "I shall give you a ship's ticket, and you may go to America safe." The second time I saw him he asked me for 45 dollars for the ticket. which I paid him. He took me to an office in the City, and asked me for another 20 dollars, which I paid him. When I was about to leave London I said to prisoner, "I am afraid on account of my eyes." He said, "You need not be afraid of that at all. Do not bother me. Go straight. Nobody will stop you." I went to Liverpool and on to the ss. Canada, when the ship's doctor examined my eyes and I was rejected. I returned to London and saw the prisoner, and said, "Why did you hay me a ship's ticket to Montreal? I wanted to go to Winnipeg, and paid you £13.' He said, "You keep quiet, or otherwise I shall throw you out." I asked for my money back, and he said, "You go out. I did not receive from you £13; I received £8 only." When I got my ticket I signed a book with three crosses. I cannot write. I never got my money back, and my eyes are not cured.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had been to a doctor at Antwerp for a month or more. He did me no good. He attended me for money, and he did not give it me back. I stayed in prisoner's house for three weeks, and he attended my eyes during that time. He did not say I was cured, but that I was able to pass the doctor. When I paid him the 10 dollars he agreed to cure me sufficiently to pass the ship's doctor. He took me to Hether<lb/>ington's, in the Strand, about the ticket. I do not know whether prisoner paid, but Hetherington gave him the ticket. I have not applied to the Dominion line for my money back. I have an English solicitor. I do not know if he he applied to Hether<lb/>ington for the return of the money.</p>

                  </hi>, 80, Teesdale Street, Bethnal Green, labourer. I was desirous of going to America, and had some sort of disease in my eyes. I called on prisoner in May. He said, "I shall cure you in five or six weeks, and you can go then to America. If you find the money you shall get a ticket and you may go." I paid prisoner £9, and got receipt (pro<lb/>duced). Prisoner said, "You will be able to go in about a fortnight's time. You must not go to work for about a fort<lb/>night, and then you can proceed." I never got a ticket or my money. I asked prisoner for the money back. He said, "Now</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110161"/>
               <p>you must go. If you do not want to go you shall not get the money. You may sue me for it." I asked for the ticket. When I called for the ticket I had not paid anything towards it. After I had paid I never asked for the ticket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I come from Lithuania. I had not been attended there for my eyes. I do not feel any pain, and I knew nothing about my eyes being bad until I came. I came to England two years last March. I came to prisoner in May, 1906, and paid him the money on July 8. Prisoner did not say I was cured, but that I could go to America. I received a letter from prisoner on August 20, but I cannot read, and I went to his house next morning, and I was told he had been taken away. [Detective <hi rend="smallCaps">CABON</hi>, interposing, stated that he had taken a letter from prisoner to Martinkus, which he had handed to the solicitor for the prosecution.] As prisoner did not let me go to America at once I decided not to go. I preferred to remain in London.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When I asked prisoner for my money he said he had bought a ticket for me. I asked him to show me the ticket. He said, "I have not got it here," I said, "If you have not got it you never bought it." I asked him twice at his house for it.</p>

                  </hi>, furrier. I have known the prisoner for 51/2 months. I went to him in March about my eyes. I do not feel any pain, but there is something wrong with them. I paid prisoner £1, and he said, "I shall cure your eyes in three weeks time, and then you may proceed to America." I afterwards paid prisoner 10s. He commenced treating; me in March, and it lasted till some time in August After Whitsun I paid him £8—£6 for a ticket and £2 to be produced on my arrival at New York. He asked me to find the money. He said, "You may soon go after you have paid that" I told prisoner that I wanted to go to America. He was to get the ticket I asked him for it about 10 times. He always told me on each occasion,</p>

               <p>"You may sue me if you like." I asked for the money and got a return of £3. After receiving the £3 I had to pay him 10s., and he said, "You will be able to proceed to America." I have never got my money or ticket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Until prisoner was locked up I never com<lb/>plained. I come from Russia. When I got to Pilsit, in East Prussia, we found out we could not pass, and we were advised not to go direct to America, but through England. When I went to prisoner he told me that he hoped to satisfy the doctor in about three weeks—make me fit to pass the doctor my brother had been treated by him before and he has gone to America. He did not suffer from trachoma; he had no neces sity to go to prisoner, but I went because I suffered. He went to get his eyes cured. Prisoner cured his eyes and let him go to America. Prisoner went to the office and paid there for the ticket, and handed it to my brother, who cannot speak English. I wish I had the money. I would go back to my own country.</p>

                  </hi>, cabinet maker. I think my eyes were all right, but they would not let me pass in America. I saw the prisoner about the middle of May, and he said, "You will be able to go to America in four weeks' time." I paid him 36s., and he treaded me for eight weeks and three days for that. I had a ticket which I left with prisoner. Prisoner gave me a card and told me to go to Southampton, and if they would not let me pass to show the card. He said, "You may be sure you can go now." I went to Southampton and was rejected. I saw prisoner, and he told me to get treated for two weeks longer and then I could go, and if I was unable to go he would return my money. I did not get the money back. I wit treated for two weeks longer. The longer I was treated the worse I got.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On my arrival in Berlin I was told the doctor would not let me go to America direct from Hamburg, and that I had better go by London. For the prisoner's medi<lb/>cal treatment for eight weeks, twice daily examination, plenty of physic, and three weeks' lodging in his house, I paid him 36s., and when I asked for my money back he said, "I won't return your money, but I will have you sent back to Russia or put in prison for your cheek." That was after I had had the extra 11/2 weeks' treatment.</p>

I have robbed no one of a penny. Pullman went away on his own responsibility and signed my book to that effect." He handed me book produced.

               <p>bought his ticket." I took the prisoner to Arbour Square Police Station. He made no reply when the charge was read over. I searched him and found on him £9 3s. 31/4 d. He said, "I have got that ready for the Board of Trade." He also had a letter from the Board of Trade Surveyor's office: "79, Mark Lane, August 20,1906,—Sir,—I have been shown a receipt signed by yourself for £9 paid to you by C. Martinkus for a passage to America. Section 345 of the Merchant Shipping Act makes it illegal for anyone to accept money in respect of a steerage pas<lb/>sage who is not an appointed agent, and such appointment must be signed by the Emigration Officer of the Court. I therefore require you to produce your appointment and explain this transaction prior to my advising the Board as to your prosecution." The answer to that letter is: "I have sent to C. Martinkus a letter that he should call for the payment of £9, which he had given to me and begged me to do him the favour to buy him a ticket from London to Romford Falls, U.S.A. I did not know that it is against the law, and, being willing to oblige C. Martinkus, I took the money from him and gave a receipt, No. 196, on July 8, 1906. I write to let you know that I have no answer to my letter, which I have sent to him. He promised that he would call to-day for his money, but he did not come, so will you kindly be good enough to let me know what I have to do with the money. Thanking you in antici<lb/>pation, I remain, yours faithfully, J.F. Midloursky."</p>

                  </persName> P.C. 88, G Division. On August 6, 1906, I was on special duty at the Britannia Theatre, Hoxton. At 11.30 p.m. my attention was called to a woman in the pit smoking a cigarette, which is contrary to the regulations. I spoke to her. A man named Bryan was seated next to her, and then the prisoner. I knew Bryan by sight, and had seen prigoner several times in his company. Bryan used very foul language, and asked what business it had to do with me. I said, If you do not know how to behave yourself you will have to go outside." I got hold of him to pull him out, when the</p>

               <p>prisoner got up and fired a loaded revolver. The first bullet grazed my chin, and it slightly bled. Prisoner was about a foot or 18 inches from me. I at once got hold of him by the neck, letting go of Bryan. Prisoner fired two more shots, which appeared to me to be in the air. The auditorium was in darkness as the spectacle was on. The next morning I found that a bullet had passed through the top part of my tunic, coining out of the shoulder, and just catching the shoulder of my shirt. When I had seized the prisoner Bryan took hold of belt produced and was going to strike me with it, when P.C. Ward rushed in and stopped him. I then said, "Take this man, that is the man who shot me." He took prisoner, and I took Bryan to the station. In reply to the charge, prisoner said, "I fired up in the air. I did not mean it for you.' He was quite sober. On searching him nine cartridges were found in the belt produced. The pistol was dropped, and not re<lb/>covered by the police. The other belt produced we took from Bryan.</p>

I rushed inside; people rushing out, said, "Governor, you are wanted inside; there is someone mur<lb/>dered" I saw the last witness with a large crowd round him, and went to his assistance. He said, "Follow that man; he is the man that shot me." I seized the prisoner, who became very violent, and got him into the attendants' room till the crowd could get away. Prisoner said, "Let me go. I did not mean it for him. I fired in the air." There was almost a panic in the theatre. There were people in the upper part; this was in the pit under the balcony. As we took the prisoner and Bryan to the station we were assaulted with stones and bottles. When charged, the prisoner replied, "I did not mean it for you; I fired in the air." In the dock at the station, when charged, prisoner said, "I will do for some of you; I will make it hot for you." He was sober. On searching him I found belt produced with seven cartridges in it.</p>

                  </hi>, Police-constable 827 k. On August 16, about 9.10 a.m., I met prisoner in New Road, Seven Kings, Ilford, about a mile and a half from prosecutor's premises. He was carrying two bags; I asked him where he had got them from; he said he had bought them down the road. I asked what number? He said, "49." I said we would go there and make inquiries. He said it was no use going, as he might have made a mistake in the number, and he would not know the house again. I took him to the station and charged him with unlawful possession; later, as the result of inquiries, I charged him with stealing the property from 12, Abbey Road, Barking Side, at four o'clock that morning. He said he was not there at that time, and that he had paid It. 2d. for the lot.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I saw you at seven o'clock in the morning. You had nothing with you then.</p>

He said, "My friend and I have been for a drive and the horse hat slipped and hurt its legs and we have made up our minds to sell it and have it killed." I said, "Where is it!"He replied, "Up in the field." When I go up to the field I saw Dairs. I asked them what they wanted to pert with the horse for, and they said it was "licked—knocked to the world," and that they would not be able to get it home I asked how long they had had it, and they said about three weeks and had bought it at the Caledonian Cattle Market, paying £3 10s. for it. I told them if they brought it down to the Swan I would pay them for it. It was a mere wreck, and I gave 12s. 6d. for it to slaughter for cats' meat. I questioned them again when I bought it, and Elliott said he bought it of a friend in the Holloway Road. I afterwards called in the police, as, on thinking it over, I did not think they had come by it honest. The owner came for it between three and four on Sunday morning, and I handed it over to the police. To prisoner Elliott. I understood you or Dairs to say you hid had the mare three weeks.</p>

At quarter-past seven the same morning I missed her. I valued the animal at £8. I used her in my business. On the morning of Sunday, September 2, I identified her. The place where I saw her is about eight or nine miles from Temple Mill Lane. She was very much fatigued, M if she had been over-driven. She is getting all right now. Of course, driving a horse off grass is not like driving it when. it has been fed with corn.</p>

On June 20 prisoner brought to me a Ralli car and asked if we could paint the wheels, as he had a customer he thought would buy it if they were painted yellow. He wanted it varnished over, and he asked if we had a spanner to fit the caps of the wheels. I gave him one, and he took the caps off. He said they belonged to a cart he had at home, and he asked me to fit on two others and finish the car as quickly as possible. Pri<lb/>soner came on the following Sunday, paid me for what I had done, and took it away. I had seen (prisoner before in the market, but I did not know him. I certainly did not know the car had been stolen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner brought the car to me at 7 p.m. It looked much better when painted. He took both caps away. Prisoner told me his brother was William Dunning, whom I have known for some time. Prisoner told me he was living at Fremantle. I have worked for William Dunning, and know the family.</p>

Previously to that, he has been employed as manager for James Nelson, who has butchers' shops all over the country, and previously he was with W. and R. Fletcher, Limited, for seven or eight years. He is 23, went into their employment as a boy, and became their manager. Lucas has done work for me. My brother George has earned his living all his life by buying and selling horses.

I do not know where he has gone. 5, Victoria Road is a private house where prisoner lodged, having one room let to him. The meat was kept in the stables. A day or two after I handed the prisoner the £29 he went to look for em<lb/>ployment at Cardiff, where he has a sister. I wrote to him to come back, and the police then saw him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I have known the prisoner for some time in Southampton. Before I bought this pony I had seen him driving it about Southampton, and to Romsey Market on several occasions. He drove it to my place before I bought it. I made him an offer &amp; week before I bought it of about £12, which he would not take. I then raised my offer to £14 7s., which he accepted. On June 29 I told prisoner that the pony was stolen and that Mr. Wright had taken it away. Prisoner said he did not think the pony was stolen. He afterwards paid me £4 10s. and £9 17s., returning me my money. I did not exactly know prisoner's address, but I knew where to find him. I know where his house and his stables are, and that he lived in Vic<lb/>toria Road.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Prisoner told me he bought the pony from his brother, and that he paid £14 for it. He told me that directly I told him it was stolen on the evening of the my Wright claimed it.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-sergeant, stationed at Southampton. On Sunday, June 24, in consequence of what I had heard, I went to a stable in Gower Road, Shirley, near Southampton, where I saw a Welsh chestnut mare pony. On comparing it. with the description given in the "Police Gazette," I found utey were identical. From what I was told by the witness Barter, I saw the prisoner Dunning at his stables in Victoria Road. I said, "I am a police officer. I want you to account for the possession of a pony which you sold to Barter on June 11 last." The prisoner replied, "I bought it from my brother George about five weeks ago. He drove it down here. I paid him £14 for it. I thought it was all right as he is, a hone dealer." On August 4 I arrested the prisoner in Trafal<lb/>gar Road, Shirley, Southampton. I said, "I am going to arrest you on a charge of horse-stealing in London in con junc<lb/>tion with your brother George." He replied, "Yes, he let me in for this. I never thought a brother would do anything like that The last lime I saw him was outside Claphftm Junction station, when I bought the trolley, which is at Swaythling, from him and another man." He said he knew the other mans Christian name. The prisoner gave me the first intimation about the trolley. He did not tell me anything about Dr. Perkins' mare or the ralli car, although he had the oppor<lb/>tunity of doing so. I subsequently heard that they were itolen and traced to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. When prisoner told me I knew nothing abort the stealing of the trolley—he gave the first informa<lb/>tion about that and said that it was at Swaythling, which was quite true. When the prisoner told me I went to Swaythling and got to Mr. Pitter in that wav. I have no reason to dis<lb/>believe that prisoner had been driving the trolley about South<lb/>ampton for five weeks. I have known prisoner for the last 12 months by seeing him driving about, and during that time be has been carrying on business as a dealer in mean and poultry driving about from door to door, to restaurants and houses. He has had no recognised shop. He is a kind of</p>

He had come back to Southampton before I arrested him. Before he left he went to Inspector Alison and told him he was going away. He did not mention where he was going, or he would (have been ar<lb/>rested sooner.</p>

                  </hi>, Detective-Sergeant, J Division, stationed at Leyton. About 4.30 p.m. on Aug. 5 I saw prisoner at Southampton Police-station. I said "I am a police officer and I am going to convey you to Leyton, where you will be charged with being concerned with George Dunning, not in custody, in stealing and receiving a chestnut pony of the value of £25 between the 16th and 17th May last, the property of Mr. Wright, of Leyton; and further with stealing and receiving a bay mare the property of Dr. Perkins, of Barking, and A ralli car, the property of Mr. Allerton, of Wan stead. The pony you sold to Mr. Barker, of Nurseling, near Southampton. The mare, ralli car and a set of harness were put in a tale by you at Salisbury." Prisoner scud, "All right. I had ill of them from my brother George. He brought the pony to me at Southampton. I paid him £14 for it and sold it to Mr. Barter for the same money. I kept it about five weeks before I sold it. The mare, cart and harness my brother brought to me at Southampton on a Sunday night. I gave him £24 for the turn out, but as it was no use to me, he told me I had better put it in a sale. I did so and it was sold on the Tues<lb/>day week following the Sunday I bought it. I also bought a pony, trolley and a set of harness for £13 from George tad another man outside Clapbam Junction Railway Station about seven weeks ago. The, pony I sold to Mr. Patihard, at Fre<lb/>mantle." Mr. Pathard is a harness maker. He and Barter are two different people. "The trolley and harness I sold with an old grey pony to Mr. Plliter, at Swaythling. My brother George wrote to me to meet him at Clapham Junc<lb/>tion." On Aug. 17 I was present at Stratford Police Court when the Goldbourne and Perkins charges were read over to prisoner. He said. "That is right."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. On August 5 he told me about the trolley, without any suggestion from me. I did not know it had been stolen. The statements he made were quite correct.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 5, Viotodl Road, Fremantle. For the last 10 months I have been doing J very large meat round, driving round to many customers and selling meat and poultry at their doors—restaurants and private houses. I had a stable three doors from 5, Victoria Road, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110175"/>
               <p>a place to store meat. Before that I was employed for two years as manager in a shop of James Nelson at Commercial Road, Portsmouth. I am 23 years old now. Before going to Kelson I had been with W. and R. Fletcher, meat importers, who have shops all over England. I began with them as errand boy, became manager of a shop, and left to go to a larger shop for Kelson. My brother George is about 30. He has been a horse dealer as long as I can remember. The mare and Ralli ear were brought to me by George, with a set of harness, to 5, Victoria Road, on Sunday, Jane 17, and I bought the lot for £24, and paid him in gold. He told me he had bought it from a doctor. He said it would be good for letting out I told him to buy me a little one. He said he had some work to do and wanted to get away, and he advised me to buy it, have it done up, and put it in the Salisbury auction. He said, "It will get you a pound or two." He told me no was going away, he had some more horses coming. A day or two before I had asked him if he had a pony and trap that would suit me for letting out—that I had sold my pony to Mr. Barter, and if he came across another pony and trap he could buy it for me. I wrote to Waters and Rawlins and sold it, as stated. At Salisbury there is a special sale for horses. "I know Lucas the coach<lb/>builder. I took the car to him, explained that William Dun<lb/>sing was my brother, and got him to do it up. When I bought the trap there was only one cap, and I put on one of my own caps and drove it to Lucas. I asked for a spanner, and took both caps off. Why I had it painted in that way was I met a man who told me if I had it painted yellow he could find me a customer for it. The man never came any more, and I sent it to the auction. I paid my brother £24, and paid Lucas £2 16s., and received from Waters £29 odd, and cashed his cheque with my brother William. I had no idea but that George had obtained them honestly. I dealt with him and knew him as a horse dealer. I never dreamt he would do such a thing as sell me stolen property. About five weeks before June 11 George led the mare pony which I sold to Mr. Barter up to 5, Victoria Road. I gave him £14 for it, and considered it an honest transaction. Barter made me an offer of £11, which I refused. I had several biddings for it. I used it for five weeks, driving about, and Barter stopped me and bought it for £14 7s. A week or two before June 11 my brother wrote to me to come up to Clapham Junction and see a pony trolley and harness. I went up by the first train, and met him with a man named Jim, whom I did not know. The trolley and pony were in a yard and coachhouse near by. I went to see it, and offered £13. The price asked was £16, and my brother advised Jim to let me have it for the money I offered which he did, and I paid £13 to Jim. I then drove it down to Southampton, drove</p>

               <p>it about Southampton for five or six weeks, and then pat the advertisement produced in the "Southern Daily Echo." Either I or the chap in my employ was using it every day for five or six weeks. Pitter called and I sold it to him with a hone I had bought from Bathard. I sold the pony to Bathard for £4 and a large horse and then sold the trolley and horse to Pitter for £7 10s. and a wagonette. Pitter had it on approval for two days. It was in the same condition as when I bought it. On June 24 Sergt. Pollock came and saw me. was asked nothing about the Ralli car and I did not mention it. On July 2 I went to Cardiff and before I left I told the police I was going. I worked at Cardiff till Aug. 4 for Janet Nelson. I heard my brother George had been arrested and I came straight back to Southampton of my own free will. When I bought these things I had not the slightest idea my brother had been acting dishonestly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had a large business as a meat dealer, taking about £20 a week, sometimes £30. When I left South<lb/>ampton my father started on the round and is doing it now. I told him I was going into a situation again—that I was going back to Nelsons. I did not know what shop I should go to. I mentioned the name of Nelsons to the police. I never had any idea that my brother was a horse steadier and I do not be<lb/>lieve he is now. I do not know where he is. I believe he has been tried once and acquitted. I made very little—in<lb/>deed I lost money—by swopping horses. On June 17 I had two carts and ponies. My brother asked me to come up to Clapham Junction and see the trolley, and I went up and bought it. It is not an unusual thing for dealers to do. My brother used to live at Eastleigh about 12 months ago.</p>

That order was not executed. We had not pre<lb/>viously known the firm of Watson and Brandon. In June of this year we received an order from the "Eastern Pure Drug Co.," manufacturing chemists, Maryland Road, Stratford, for six dozen of Kepler a Extract and three dozen antipyrin. That order was signed H. Erosick. The heading at the top of the order was "Telegrams: Edco, Stratford," and "Bankers, London and South Western." That order was executed, He value of the goods being £9 12s. That also became a bad debt. We received a subsequent order from that firm, the value of the goods being £15 16s. 9d. It was not then our custom to make inquiries through Stubbs concerning new customers. We subsequently executed an order of the Eastern Pure Drug Company for antipyrin tablets to the amount of £3 16s. 6d. On June 23 we got an order for a copy of Remington's Practice of Pharmacy from the Eastern Pure Drug Company and signed "G. Miller, R.P." That was also sent, the value of the work being 17s. 10d. On June 25 we received an order from the same company, with a slightly different heading, "Drugs and Chemicals, Proprietories, Patent Medicine, Stationery, Per<lb/>fumery, and General Trade Sundries. "' Telegrams and bankers as before. That was an order for Hazeline, menthol snuff, and Kepler's Extract, amongst other thing's, and the value of the goods was £14 11s. 2d. We subsequently received a letter com<lb/>plaining that we had despatched large Kepler's, and requesting us to send them small ones, but that we did not attend to. A further letter was received asking the reason of the delay, but by that time we had received certain information, and we sent a letter which came back marked "Gone away." The whole amount of goods ordered by G. Hill and Co. and the Eastern Pure Drug Company was £56. At the time we parted with the goods we believed the statements contained in the letter. They appeared to be from genuine firms carrying on genuine businesses.</p>

Amongst the list of things he had to offer were Haselene cream, Hazeleae scent, menthol snuff, large Kepler's malt and oil, Icilina cream, and anti-pyrine tabloids. He said I could have the goods at 50 per cent, off Burroughs and Wellcome's list. I asked him to call back again in an hour's time as I was rather suspicious that it was not all right. In the meantime I telephoned to Messrs. Burroughs and Wellcome. When he returned he left samples, and I said I would write. I saw him once more, when he offered me 60 per cent. off. On July 2 I bought certain goods under instructions at a little more than 60 per cent, off the list prices. He signed the receipt produced, "James Miller," in my presence.</p>

I knew the elder one by the name of Wright, and the younger prisoner was supposed to be his son. The rent was paid within about three weeks. I had no notice that they were going. I saw things going in and out on different occasions in the name of George Wright and Co. It was a private house, and there was no shop. There was ft board outside with the inscription, "Wholesale drug manufac<lb/>turers and patent medicine vendors." I saw persons going in and out, but what their business was I could not say. I found the premises vacated about the end of January this year. I subsequently happened to meet the elder prisoner in the street and made inquiries about the arrears, which he said would eventually be forthcoming I told him I thought he was ft fraud. I do not think he made any reply. They had a little furniture. As tenants, they were not anything worth having, and I was glad to get rid of them. The accommodation con<lb/>sistedof five rooms and a scullery. In the course of my in<lb/>quiries I went to 75, Jersey Road. That is a private house, and there are no business premises.</p>

I am land-lord of 117, and recollect, on May 26, letting a floor of that house to a man who gave the name of Frank Millership, whom I recognise as the younger prisoner. There were three rooms, a flat really, and the rent was 6s. 6d. a week. It was never occupied, and no furniture was ever there. Five weeks were paid. The library was the only thing that was ever delivered there, and when that was taken away by prisoner and another man, the rent paying ceased. I went to see where they took it. They took it to 118, Studley Road. I then went to the police station and communicated my suspicions to the police. Pri<lb/>soner told me he was formerly employed at the Great Eastern Railway works at Stratford, but that wais too hard work, and he afterwards got employment with the Eastern Pure Drug Company. If the rent had not been paid I should not have allowed him to take the library away.</p>

                  </hi>, 135, Devonshire Road, Chiswick. I am a glass merchant in a very small way of business. The younger prisoner did not receive commission from me; he was paid by the elder prisoner, if paid at all. The elder prisoner received the whole of the moneys. I received one account only. I en<lb/>dorsed one cheque in the name of "J. Hayward." I had nothing to do with the selling. I was manager. My wife was in partnership with George Millership, and I managed the busi<lb/>ness for my wife.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I do not know anything about drugs, and I did not make them up.</p>
               <p>Examination continued. I engaged a man of the name of Gardener to remove goods to Mr. Garman's, chemist, Roman Road. I received the cheque for them, and that is the only money I received.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The elder prisoner and my wife carried on the business of the Eastern Pure Drug Company. He told me</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110186"/>
               <p>his name was Miller when I first knew him. I know nothing of George Wright and Co. except what I heard at West Run. The elder prisoner showed me a circular when he first asked me to go into the wholesale drug business, and explained to me that the profits were about 50 per cent. The elder prisoner ordered "Edco" to be put at the top of the heading. We intended to register it. It was snarled as a bona-fide busmen. We manufactured five things and paid for the manufacture of the drugs when we first started. I authorised "Bankers, Lon<lb/>don and South-Western," because my wife had an account there. We intended to put ail our money there. I received only one account of £3 5s. I do not know who looked after the as counts. I was rather busy at the time selling my business. I happened to move just about the time of the prosecution. It was when I found out from other people the character of the elder prisoner. I knew goods were being brought from Messrs Burroughs and Wellcome, for which not a single farthing was being paid. I did not know they were being sold at less than the invoice price. My wife has still an account with the Lon<lb/>don and South-Western Bank, but I do not think she had any money there. She lost her last £30 in this business, which was only carried on for three weeks.</p>

                  </hi> (Prisoner, on oath) read a long statement, in which he detailed his relations with Plosky, who was intro<lb/>duced to him with reference to the recipe of a patent medicine he wished to purchase. That transaction led to further nego<lb/>tiations, and they introduced two proprietary medicines which were placed on the market. It was subsequently arranged that Mrs. Annie Plosky should be a partner in the business, and that the prisoner should be given one-half of the profits for hit services, and further that in the event of him being able to pat £100 to Mrs. Plosky's £100 he should become a partner. Plosky stated that although his wife's name appeared in the document be was really at the head of the concern, but Mrs. Plosky's name was used simply as a cover or blind for his very numerous creditors, who otherwise might have made things uncomfort<lb/>ably warm for him. A few days after commencing business he stated his intention of using his wife's maiden name of Krosick instead of Plosky. Prisoner considered himself a ser<lb/>vant in a firm with fairly good prospect. Plosky also used the names of Miller and Krosick in his orders and correspon<lb/>dence, the reason for that being, he said, to make the firm appear of more consequence. His own work consisted in the composition of circulars, labels, and advertisements, and the superintendence of the manufacture of goods for the market, the sale of which could have been rapidly increased. The use of the name of the London and South-Western Bank was sug<lb/>gested by Plosky. who justified it on the ground that his wife had an account there. He understood the name "Edco" was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110187"/>
               <p>registered. It was arranged that a low parcels of goods should be obtained on credit and sold even at a loss against invoice and Plosky stated his determination to pay all accounts of the Estern Puro Drug Company out of the proceeds of the sale and so to meet currenti expenses and provide money for advertising purposes. As Plosky explained to the magistrate, all the money obtained was wallowed up in expenses. His remuneration was small, but he quite expected a successful issue, when he would be in receipt of a fairly good salary. Agents were appointed 10 sell on commission and a few sales were effected. With regard to the goods sold to Messrs. Beedzler, of Norton Folgate, the younger prisoner was instructed to sell in the name of Fox, as he had heard that Messrs. Beedzler had done business with a man of that name some years ago. It was done to facilitate sales, and he also used his former business name of George Wright and Co. for the same purpose, and he intended to transfer the old business of George Wright and Co. to the Eastern Pure Drug Company. It had transpired that Plosky had since called upon Messrs. Burroughs and Wellcome, he presumed with the intention of incriminating him, but he would unhesitatingly say that if there was any criminality in the matter it appertained to Plosky alone. The younger prisoner had simply sold goods flu commission for Plosky. He had recently left the employ<lb/>ment of the Great Eastern Railway Company and was seeking lighter work on account of his delicate health. He had held good references throughout his career. The purchase of the 'International Library' was really a private transaction of the younger prisoner. At the time of 'the arrest he had written giving notice of the change of address, and the one instalment was only a few days overdue. Prisoner also claimed to have conducted a perfectly legitimate business in drugs and chemists' sundries.</p>

The entry against him in the company's books was, "Thrown of! through long absence from work" He was previously employed for four years at a bonded tea ware" house. His mother is a school teacher in Warwickshire and is separated from his father, who, in the greater part of 1905, I believe, was in America. The elder prisoner has been under tilt notice of the police for some years. He lived at 187, Vicarage</p>

                  </hi>. I am a qualified medical practitioner, with both medical and surgical degrees, and practise at Pem<lb/>broke Gardens. About three years ago &amp; patient came to my place and gave the name of Alice Jones, and desired medical attention. She told me she had a discharge, and that the man she lived with also bad the same, and wanted me to call to see him. I called and saw Tentori on Saturday, December 13. He asked me to treat them, both him and the woman, and said he would pay. After that I attended the two of them for two or three months till they were well. I rendered the account to Tentori, and he did not pay, and I called and saw him. At that time he had a small printing place, and I said, "You had better de me some printing." Then be called one day and said I bad had as much printing as I was entitled to. I said, "Well, in future when you come to me you must pay cash," which they did. The next time I saw them was about two years afterwards. On May 27, 1904, in the night time, I was called down by pri<lb/>soner and this woman. They were on the steps. She was covered with blood, and had two black eyes, and he was helping her up. He brought her inside, and I plugged her nose. They paid me 2s. cash. I called to see her next morning, and she was soon quite well. Then she called on November 30 last year. She said she had a discharge similar to the one before, so I gave her some powder and some medicine. She paid me each time. A few days after she said the discharge was no better. I said, "Bring a neighbour, and I will examine you." She said she had no friends, and did not want people to know. I then examined her. She was suffering from gonorrhoea. On June 13 she called and said, "I am getting no better." I said, "Are you syringing yourself properly?" She said the syringe</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110189"/>
               <p>she had before was perished. I said the could get one at the. chemists, and she said, "I have not got the money." I said, "You bad better get some from Tentori." She said, "He hat. not got any money." I said, "It is a bad state to get into, and I will let you have a syringe if you promise to pay for it, 4s.' That was the only time I trusted her. She paid before the end of the month, so I never sent a bill. She was nearly well then. On another occasion she called and gave roe certain details, and said she was certain there was something wrong with her. I said, "I cannot help that," and she went away. Next morning Tentori called, and asked me to put her right I said, "That is an illegal operation, I cannot do anything of that kind." He said, "Give her some medicine." I said, "That is just as bed as. the other, if you give it with intent." He got very excited, and said, "If you do not do something with her, she was here last nigh alone, and we will go to Stratford and get a summons, and we will charge you with criminal assault." I said, "You can do what you like," and they went off. I knew he was a. dangerous character, and I was up there a few days after, and I called to see him. I said, "You threatened to get a sum<lb/>mons." Re said, "We have decided to make you pay." I said, "Do what you like," and he said, "You will hear from my solici<lb/>tor in a day or two." I received a letter from a solicitor in Romford, and referred the matter to my own solicitor. I re<lb/>ceived the following letter from Tentori, dated March 17: "Referring to your call here on February 5, to see if I would accept your offer to find a home for Miss Jones till after her confinement, for whose condition you admitted you were respon<lb/>sible, as I then informed you, I was taking legal advice in the matter. At my solicitor's advice, I am placing my signed state<lb/>ment of our interviews, Miss Jones' signed statement, and other proofs in the hands of the police authorities at once. I con<lb/>sulted a local doctor, explaining the case, and also told him what Miss Jones stated and signed respecting the instruments you used and the operation you performed on her to try and alter her condition. He did not care to attend her after what you had done, and strongly advised me to take her to Dr. Wright, the divisional police-surgeon at Romford. He said any respectable doctor would have to inform the police of the case, as It was a very serious matter. I am sorry for your wife and children that I am obliged to take this step, but I feel con<lb/>vinced that it is my duty for the public safety to do so.—Yours, etc., George Tentori."</p>
               <p>That letter is not here. I never admitted responsibility for Miss Jones' condition, and I never performed an operation on her. On receipt of that letter I went to my solicitor, and he said, "I will take the letter to the police—you cannot take, sction on it, because it has not been published "; and, of course,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110190"/>
               <p>I thought I could not. I heard nothing more until my wife got a letter, when I was at Bournemouth. I wrote back to her and said, "Go and see Mr. White and ask him if he has been to the police." On returning home I went to the police with these two letters and my books. I said, "Some proceedings must be taken to stop this man," and they said they would write out some document and I could make an application. I said, "I must have a new solicitor." The new solicitor advised me that, legally speaking, publication did not matter. The police said that Tentori had not been when he said he would, but he had been later.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. He was first—that was my solicitor's fan. I wanted him to go and he would not. When I saw the police I learned that some application had been made for a warrant against me for attempting to procure abortion. The police had got from prisoner the powder and found it was not for the pur<lb/>pose that he stated, therefore they declined to take any action in the matter. It was analysed by the expert' at the Home Office. It was the medicine I gave her for gonorrhoea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was first registered in 1888. I was a student at Leeds, and started practice at Leeds. I was there eight years. I have not been married twice. I am married now. I was married about nine years ago; I cannot tell yon the date; at Paddington Registry Office. My wife was a Miss Wilde. I have not got two wives that I know of. Most de<lb/>cidedly she is the only wife I have. My eldest child is eight years of age. I have been charged with being the father of two children other than by my lawful wife. A bastardy sum<lb/>mons was issued against me on May 24. At that time I was not contemplating leaving the country. I contemplated going for I voyage to the Cape and back. I went to a specialist in Harley Street, and he advised me to stop work for six months. I had a nervous ailment. I spoke to my partner, and he said he did not want to be left for six months with a locum tenens. There is an action between me and the locum tenens, but judgment has not been given. I sold half the practice to him for £600 and he declined to complete; he would not pay the instalments, and I issued a writ against him. He issued a summons against me and professed to be a locum tenens. My writ against him it pending. About a fortnight or three weeks ago I got a bastardy summons which was issued in 1902. It was only served the other day. I saw the person who issued it in July. It was withdrawn because the child could not be produced. There was no child. I arranged to pay a sum of money per month to the mother if the child was produced. It was £1 a month. I do not deny that I had intercourse with the mother of that child. I have never denied that I might be the father of the child; but there is no child ail the same. There are no other children</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110191"/>
               <p>that I am paying for. I have never told Dr. Cullom that there was a child for which I was paying at Leech. There was no child born at Leeds of which I was alleged to be the father; it is an absolute lie. I did not attempt to perform an operation on the woman, the mother of the child referred to above, at Hammonds Hotel, Euston Road.</p>
               <p>Mr. Overend objected to this matter being gone into, on the ground that when the case came before the Recorder he directed that particulars of justification, giving names and dates, should be delivered to prosecutor, and this matter was not mentioned. Objection allowed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examination continued. There is no entry in my book on the first occasion that Alice Jones came to me showing the nature of the disease. I am speaking from memory as to that The next occasion was in May, 1904. I never attended prisoner for ptomaine poisoning. It is not true that I was asked to do so then. On November 30, 1904, she did explain that her con<lb/>dition was brought about by a swing. What I saw was not in<lb/>consisient with that. I deny that she came for ointment for a neighbour's child and that I then locked the door and had connection with her. I never had connection with her. I deny that I had connection with her in a chair, or that she told me that I should get her into trouble, or that I said she was not to tell, or that she called on me early in January and said that her periods had not come on, and she feared she was in trouble through what I had done. She men<lb/>tioned about her periods two or three times through December, is my book shows. On December 1 there is "Jones, Is.," and on the same day, "Jones, 2s." The last entry is another person. I deny that she saw me in January and told me I had got her into trouble, or that I gave her some pills and medicine, or that I gave her medicine for bringing on her periods. I made a charge for the medicine I did give her. (To the Commissioner. I have entered ail the medicines, in the book and the amounts the paid me.) I deny that in January I examined her breasts and private parts and had connection with her, or that I told her I should have to use an instrument, or that I showed her one like that which I should have to use, only larger, or that I tried to insert an instrument which was too large, or that I told her it was necessary to "grease the passage." It is all ridicu<lb/>lous nonsense. The only time I examined her I used the specu<lb/>lum. Fused a piece of cotton wool on the end of the uterine sound; that was at the end of November. That is the proper thing to use. I deny that I told her to come next day when I would have a smaller instrument. I used no instrument in January or February. The uterine sound might produce abor<lb/>tion if it were put into the womb; it would be a very good way of killing the woman. I did not have connection with her on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110192"/>
               <p>February 1. I deny that I said it was a case of "kill or cure," or that I said, "Can you lay up for a few days? I should hive to do this two or three times before it takes effect," or that I said if she felt pains in her stomach she was to go to bed and send for me, and that I would take it away, and that I would tell her master she had influenza and must stay in bed a few days. I deny that she said she would do away with herself I deny that on February 2 prisoner told me that she had in<lb/>formed him of what had occurred on the previous night, and that she alleged she was in the family way by me, and that on the previous evening I had had connection with her against her will. He said she had gone to my place by herself the night before, and if I would not do this they would go to Stratford and take out a summons against me. I deny that I said the was a consenting party, or that I said, "I won't say last night, but on the previous occasions she was a consenting party," or that I would get her away to a place where she was not known, and would see her through her trouble. I said, "The best thing you can do is to drop your abortion ideas and go into a home." I deny that I asked prisoner if he would see me the day following, giving as a reason that I did not want my wife to know. I called on the Monday and said, "You have made a threat, have you carried it out?" because I knew witnesses that could be got who knew something about their previous history. On the Monday he said I would hear from his solici<lb/>tor. He did not say I was not a fit and proper person to act as a doctor, and that my conduct would be brought before the College of Surgeons. I did not say I would carry out my promise and see that she was looked after. I deny that he said he would not leave her to my mercy and that he should consult the police, or that I said I was sorry he should take that step and must await developments. I heard from the police that he bad gone to them. I did not see the statement he, put before them.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Alice Jones when she called on me went into one of the front rooms on the ground floor. The front door is always open during surgery hours. If the woman was as<lb/>saulted and screamed she could be heard in the kitchen and the waiting-room.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Dr. Summerrkill. I reside with my husband at 8, Pembroke Gardens. On May 9, 1906, I re<lb/>ceived the following letter: "Dear Madame,—I do not know if you are aware of the case against your husband, who nil got Miss Jones in trouble, and whose case I put in the hands of the police. I am aware that he left for South Africa on Monday morning, and stall now take steps to bring the matter before the Royal College of Surgeons and the London College of Physicians, with the view of having him stopped from prac<lb/>tising</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110193"/>
               <p>again as a doctor, as the police inform me I can do. I shall see my solicitor and press the matter forward. Mist Jones, the young woman your husband has ruined, has been in my employ for 91/2 years, and as she has no friends, I have taken the mat/tar up, and intend to see it through. This matter must be very unpleasant, and I assure you you have my sincere sympathy.—Yours respectfully, Geo. Tentori." My husband never went to South Africa. I wrote in reply: "Sir,—I am perfectly well aware of your attempts to blackmail my husband during the past three months, so have pleasure in returning your sincere sympathy for the poor wife whom this person Jones has supplanted.—Edith Summerskill."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was married to Dr. Summerskill 10 years ago last July at Paddingtton. There are no older children Who lived with me who call me "mother." I was at home at the end of November and beginning of December, 1905. I went for a week to Yorkshire with my husband. I cannot remember the date when I first heard of any accusations mode against my husband in connection with this girl, except in the letter that prisoner sent. I saw the one written to my husband on March 17. My husband contemplated a trip to South Africa, provided the practice was sold satisfactorily. He thought he would have a sea Voyage before starting practice again. I was not to go with him. I was to stay with the three children. I could not leave three babies to go so far away. When I said in my letter, "I am perfectly well aware of your attempts to blackmail my husband," I meant that prisoner's solicitor had been ringing up to say unless Dr. Summerskill paid up "we will issue a warrant for his arrest"—and there was nothing to pay up for. I knew that prisoner threatened the doctor, as he did not procure abortion for this woman. We could not get to know what the charge against my husband was. They telephoned, "Unless he pays up we will issue a war<lb/>rant." The message went to the solicitors—they did not tele<lb/>phone us direct I knew all along that the charge was that my husband was the father of this child, but he never acknow<lb/>ledged it. I suppose he denied it when Tentori made the state<lb/>ment in the surgery. He said he would threaten him with being the father of the child unless he procured abortion for Alice Jones—that this woman had been alone with him in the surgery several times. From that date my husband knew what the charge against him was. That was February 2. He denied it then, and he did the same when he was written to. He did not know what the charge was on the telephone. They would not say on the telephone what he was to pay for, and we had to change our solicitor on that score. The words, "The poor wife whom this person has supplanted" in the letter referred to Tentori's wife. Alice Jones was not living in my house. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110194"/>
               <p>knew he had a wife, and that his wife had been away from him 10 or 12 years. I never heard she shot him. I did hear he shot himself and tried to commit suicide. Alice Jones was maid servant to the wife and Tentori, and the wife went away, I heard she was still living with her parents in North London. I cent the letter to my husband at Bournemouth. He was sup<lb/>posed to be in South Africa, but he was in Bournemouth. He was intending to go to Africa on July 7, but it was not definitely settled.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. It was an absolute falsehood on May 9 that Dr. Summerskill had gone to Africa. The house we live in is a double-fronted house with one room one side, a waiting-room, and one on the opposite side for a surgery, and it is quite dote to the main road, and the front door remains open the whole of the surgery hours. Myself and three children are about the house, and if any person were assaulted in the surgery her screams could be heard quite easily.</p>

                  </hi>, medical practitioner, Chadwell Heath. I have not seen the letter dated March 17, purporting to be written to Dr. Sumraerskill by prisoner. Prisoner called on me some time in April, and wanted me to visit and examine Miss Jones. I asked him what was the nature of the illness, and he told me that an illegal operation had been performed. I advised him, "If what you say is true you had better consult the divisional police surgeon." I did not make any further remarks. It is not true that I stated that "any respectable doctor would inform the police of the case, as it was a very serious matter." I only advised him to see Dr. Wright.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined, By going to a divisional-surgeon I meant putting it into the hands of the police.</p>
               <p>Miss <hi rend="smallCaps">MAUD HILLS</hi>, 43, Kenneth Road, Chadwell Heath. I knew prisoner about five years ago, and Alice Jones. I have been in the habit of visiting them, and I have slept there., I slept in the front bedroom. There was only one bedroom; if there was another one it was always littered up with printed matter. I have only seen one bed, that is in the room I slept in. I slept there with Alice Jones. I noticed her night linen at the fime I used to go and see her. Prisoner slept down<lb/>stairs, and not with Miss Jones. There was only one bed in the house. On the night I slept there prisoner had to sleep downstairs without a bed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I went all over the house. There are three bedrooms altogether, and Alice Jones and I occupied one. To my knowledge prisoner was downstairs. Where he generally slept I do not know.</p>
               <p>To the Judge. There was no other bedroom with a bed made up in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a single woman residing at Romford Workhouse. I was confined in the workhouse of a child three weeks ago yesterday. The father of the child is Dr. William Summerskill. I was for 91/2 years in the service of prisoner as housekeeper. I knew he was a married man and his wife had left him. During the whole time I was with prisoner we never had any intercourse or connection. Nobody else lived in the house. I first knew Dr. Summerskill about a few months after he moved to Seven Kings. I do not know how long he had been there then. I do not remember going to him suffering from a disease. I have never had any disease. I never told him that prisoner four or five years ago was himself suffering from a disease, and that I had caught it from a man at Ilford and given it to Tentori. I never told him so, and it was not the fact. He gave me medicine four or five years ago, and a syringe for the whites. He said he had plenty of girls coming to him for the same affair, and that was nothing. I remember going to him, and that I had a black eye and cut lip. I was knocked down with a swing. I went to him on November 30 to get Tentori's nephew a box of ointment for his head. The surgery door was open, and Dr. Summerskill told me to come in. I went in and he shut the door, and took me by the shoulders over the chair and misconducted himself against my wish. I told him I wanted a box of ointment, as Tentori's nephew, A little boy, had ringworm, and he gave me the ointment, and I asked him how much it was and I paid him. Then he took liberties against my wish. I could not help myself. I said he would get me into trouble. He said it would be all right, and if I was in trouble he could find me a place where I could go. I did not call out. I could not help myself. I was so nervous I did not say anything about this to anyone. The next time I went to Dr. Summerskill in December I was not suffering from a disorder of the private parts. He did not examine me in De<lb/>cember with an instrument, and he did not suggest anything about a syringe. I went to the doctor in the second week in January, being in trouble about my periods. I went into the surgery in the evening and saw Dr. Summerskill. No one else was present. I said to him, "Dr. Summerskill, I accuse you of Retting me into trouble." He said, "Are you sure?" I said, "Yes." He did not examine me or feel any part of my body or ask me any questions. He gave me a bottle of medicine and a box of pills and bold me to come back for more when that was finished. I asked him what it would be and he said, "Nothing." I had the money in my pocket at the time. I took the pills and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110196"/>
               <p>hey did not have any effect, and he told me to go down again and I went into the surgery, and he asked me if I had seen any<lb/>thing. I said "No," and he said, "Are you sure the child belongs to me?" I said, "Yes," and he said, "Curse it!" He said he had got a tool that was for married women, and he told me to go down the next morning and he would get a smaller one. I went down the next morning. He got me down on the sofa and passed a small tube first and drew that out, then he passed a large one, then he used a long, thin wire with a bit of wadding on it. I did not feel the wire in the to by and he examined my breasts and said he could not see anything. He did not have any connection at that time. Then he gave me some more medicine and asked me if I wanted any more pills, and I said "No, they made me sick." He spoke about greasing the passage on the first occasion. That was the day he passed the instrument. He had connection with me then.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I know that I said differently a little while ago. I did not think of it.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Jones. This look place in the surgery. After having connection with me on the sofa, he put up the small tube first and then the large tube, and then some wire. Ho gave me some more medicine, and I offered the money, but he would not take it. He used the words, "Kill or cure." He said if I should have any pains in the inside I wan to send down to him. If he was not at home, I was to send down to his partner and tell his partner, and he would give me something to ease the pain, but that if he was there himself he would tell Tentori I had got influenza and was to lie in bed for a few days. There were other doctors nearer than his partner. He paid, whatever came away, if I was to have a neighbour in I was to tell her it was nothing. On February 1 I went down for some more medicine and he took liberties again. I threatened my life in his surgery. He said, "Do not be so silly. Come down on Monday morning, when I will examine you again." I told him I should kill my self. When I got back home I was crying. Prisoner came in and I made the statement to him about the doctor. Next morn<lb/>ing, February 2, Tentori and I went to see Dr. Summerskill at half past ten. Tentori accused Dr. Summerskill oi taking liber<lb/>ties with me against my wish. The Doctor said, "I won't say last night, but on the other occasions she was a consenting party." Tentori said to Dr. Summerskill that I was in the family way, and he accused the doctor of it and he admitted it Nothing was said about instruments. Tentori said he would have to tell his people, and Dr. Summerskill said if he did that he would deny it. The Doctor asked Tentori if I could stop at my place another month and Tentori said "Yes." He then said, "I will see what I can do for her. I will get her into a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110197"/>
               <p>place where a woman will look after her and be a mother to her.' Tentori said, "No, he would not agree to it." Then Dr. gummerskill said, "Could he come down and tee the master at his place on the Saturday and tee what arrangement he could come to, as be did not want Mrs. Summerskill to know anything about it. The doctor did not come down on the Saturday, but on the Monday morning, and I opened the door. He aaked Tentori what he could do for me, and Tentori said it was out of hit hands. Dr. Summerskill said he would have to wait for further developments. Tentori went to see a solicitor. I did not go with him. I went to the magistrate at Stratford and made a statement in writing. I could not say the date exactly. I lai information against Dr. Summerskill and charged him with being the father of my child. That was May 24.</p>
               <p>To the Court All these three acts of connection were against my will He forced me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Before I went to live with Tentori I was a servant in Ilford, and I left my place to go to Tentori. I was receiving 1s. 6d. a week, I only took it for a short period. I lived in the house. I gave the other place up because there was too much for me to do. I knew Tentori's people in Ilford. I never saw his wife. I knew he was married. I think I came to Tentori in December. I could not say when she left. I was housekeeper to Tentori. He had no family. He lived by him<lb/>self. He was keeping a shop. He could not do his business, and see to the shop. I am 28 now. I became his housekeeper by some friends recommending me His people said they had heard a had a good character, and they thought he would have somebody in his place. I was to have 2a. 6d. a week, and there was not much to do. He paid my wages regularly. I could not save anything. Tentori hat always been able to pay me. He gave up the shop and became a printer in a small way. There were two beds in the house, one in the back room, in which I slept, one in the front room, in which prisoner slept. When Miss Hills came the used to sleep with me and prisoner took my bed. There was a bed on which Tentori used to throw printing material, and that was cleared off and I used it to sleep on. I had one pillow on my bed and prisoner one on his. He used to go without one when Miss Hills came to slop. I used to make him up one the best way I could. It did not occur to me to speak to Miss Hills about this matter. I never had anything to do with anybody unless you want to go back to later years I have never gone to Dr. Summerskill for treatment for myself except for a cold; I have not been to him for treat<lb/>ment for any disorderly disease. Before he used the speculum he said he was going to examine me; he said he wanted to see whether I was in the family way. He placed me on the sofa and looked through the tube. I was on my back, and the sofa</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110198"/>
               <p>was in a recess of the window. He stooped down to look; it was about 11 a.m. I knew he passed the tube because I could see him with the thing in his hand. When he took the wadding off the first wire he threw the wadding in the fire and took another wire. I held the tube while he rattled the wire in the bottle. I did not feel it. On the first occasion when he had connection with me he hurt me, but there was no blood.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I don't pretend to say that I was a maid at the time.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Overend. I did not call out because I was so un<lb/>nerved and he was so strong. He forced me down by the shoulders. I tried to push the chair over. I could not battle against his strength. I went to go for the door, and it was locked; he must have locked it as soon as I was in the room. I did not know what to do. I was so unnerved I could not do anything for myself. The front door was open, but I did not know there was anybody in the house. I don't know that there is only a bolt on the door outside. I did not ask him to un<lb/>lock it. I did not know that it was locked when I went for the door; he pulled me back. I did not know when he had con<lb/>nection with me that the door was locked; for all I knew it was open, and I could have walked out. I did not like to complain that he had committed this assault. I was so unnerved that I did not know what to do. I did not complain to any female. I did not know that prisoner was trying to get money from Dr. Summerskill; I don't know how much his solicitors were told by prisoner. Tentori said he should have to tell his people, so that it should not be put on his shoulders. He was to tell then before anything was said by anybody. I told the doctor that if I gob into trouble I would not have it put on Tentori's shoulden for the world. Dr. Summerskill offered to put me away where a woman would look after me and he would see to the child, bat Teuton had an aversion to this.</p>
               <p>To the Court. Dr. Summerskill said that anybody would take a person in who was pregnant, and Tervtori said it, was not a fit place for me to go to. That was Tentori's aversion.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Overend. Tentori told Dr. Summerskill that I should have to go to the workhouse; he had no money of his own to pay for me. On the 5th Tentori said, "The matter is to go out of my hands." That was at the end of the conversation. I do not know what was said before. I was in the kitchen and they were in the front room, but I could hear what was said. Dr. Summerskill asked Tentori what he would do for me in getting me away, and prisoner said it was out of his hands. Dr. Sum<lb/>merskill said he would have to wait for developments. Prisoner said it was going into other hands. He did not give any expla<lb/>nation. Dr. Summerskill did not refer to further developments laughingly. I did not hear Dr. Summerskill laugh at all. It</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110199"/>
               <p>was a serious matter. I went to the Union on June 12, because prisoner could not support me. I would not stop in the condi<lb/>tion I was in. Prisoner was not able to help me with money. When we went before the magistrates in Stratford to obtain the order, and before the application was made, I did not write the statement, but Tentori wrote it, and I gave the statement out to him word for word as I was a bad writer. I did not say in that statement that Dr. Summerskill had left, or was about to leave, for South Africa. I am sure I never mentioned South Africa at all. I did not know he was likely to go, and no one told me to.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. While I was at Tentori's during the nine years his brother sometimes visited him, and he would sleep with his brother in the front room. I have been in Romford Workhouse since June. Up to that time Tentori was carrying on business as a printer, and as far as I know he is still doing so. I do not know what he hat got. It was not his business to keep anybody else's child. I have not been friendly with Miss Hills for two years. The first time I did not know whether the surgery door was locked or not till after the assault took place. The outer door stood open. When you wanted to to into the surgery you waited in the waiting-room till the doctor called you in. If he has got any patient in the surgery you have to atop in the waiting-room. I do not know whether the doctor rings a bell or not. When I went before the magi<lb/>strates I made the first statement about all that happened to me, and after that I made another statement when I applied for the summons. When I made the first statement I had not heard he was likely to go to South Africa. Prisoner took down those statements when they were first drawn up with Mr. Mullis in Romford. The statement I made was read over to me, and it was all correct. There was a previous intimacy between me and a young man before I went to Tentori's.</p>
               <p>To the Court. There was somebody at Forest Gate that I was acquainted with years ago—it was the jame young gentle<lb/>man. That was the man I had intercourse with. That is years ago—I could not exactly say how long. I have never had any<lb/>thing since, I am sure. Dr. Bummerskill never attended prisoner. He has been down to the surgery three times. The first occasion was when my accident happened with the swing—then he went down for some ointment for my head, and the Fast occasion was when he went down on February 2. He never was under Dr. Summerskill's treatment for any disease.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Jones. Dr. Summerskill did come to see him for ptomaine poisoning. That was a year ago, I think. I sent down for Dr. Summerskill and the doctor saw him, and brought a bottle of medicine for him. I sent Mr. Springhold and Dr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110200"/>
               <p>Summerskill came up to see Tentori. With that exception he never attended him.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">FISH</hi>. In 1904 and earlier I was secretary to a Home for Fallen Women, and in connection with my duties in that capacity I came into communication with a woman named Alice Camp.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 18, Railway Street, Chadwell Heath, and my occupation is that to a printer. I am 30 years of age, and married 14 years ago, and lived with my wife for three or four years. I bad no family. My wife left me after she had been with me 31/2 years. The last I saw her or heard of her is seven years ago. After my wife left me I was living in a house at Brent wood. I had a grocery shop there. I was just getting over an accident I have been a master printer since, and am a master printer now. Alice Jones came to me for a situation nine years ago in November or December. I was living in Brent wood, and she came to me as servant while I was in Brentwood. I left there eight years ago, and she has been in my service ever since, and she is the only servant I kepi. She has had her wages paid weekly. During the whole time there has been no relationship between us except that of master and servant, and I have never hid any connection with her in my life, on my oath. We have always occupied separate rooms. There were two rooms at Brentwood. there were two bedrooms at Chadwell Heath, one occupied by me and one by her. I first knew Dr. Summerskill about 41/2 years ago. He came to me about some printing for him for a sick club he was trying to start. I printed 5,000 circulars at 25s., and 1,000 application forms on membership at 7s. 6d., which he paid me for in cash. Previous to that he had not been treating me or rendering me any service, and there was no cross account. He came to me on the recommendation of people I knew. On one occasion I did some bills for him, and I did some advertising matter for him in connection withs business he had at Walthamstow, but I was paid in cash, and the printing was never set off against medical attendance. He has never attended me for gonorrhoea, and I have not had it, and am willing to submit myself to medical examination to prove that. What he says about paying cash for the future is absolutely false. He has attended me on one occasion only, and then he never examined me. One morning Miss Jones opened the door, and he came in and said, "I have come to see your father." I said, "You have come to the wrong place He said, "It is for ptomaine poisoning." I said, "That is me.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110201"/>
               <p>I had a bottle of medicine. I have a brother who is living in Ilford; he is a married man, with a family. Towards the end of November or the beginning of December Alice Jones was lent to Dr. Summerskill to get some ointment for my nephew. I did not know the cause of her visit to the doctor's in January, not till the night of February 1. At half past 11 that night, when I got home, I found Alice Jones crying and going on in a most hysterical way. I had a conversation with her. She stated that she was in trouble through Dr. Summerskill. In consequence of what she said I took her to Dr. Summerskill next morning. When I got there Dr. Summerskill came out<lb/>side and said, "Good morning. What can I do for you?" I told him he knew what I had come down about, and he said, "No, tell me." I told him I called down about a criminal assault he had committed on my servant, Miss Jones. He said, "It was not a criminal assault, she was a consenting party." Miss Jones denied this; then Dr. Summerskill used these words: "I will not say about last night, but on the other occa<lb/>sions she was a consenting party." He asked me not to make the matter public, and not to go to the police, as he did not wish his wife to know. He said that he would get Miss Jones away to a place before her condition was apparent, and he would see her through her confinement if it did not come away before, and he would have the child placed away, and Miss Jones could come back, and no one in tie neighbourhood know anything about it. He also made the remark that she could go to a place where the would have light work to do, and that there were plenty of ladies who did not mind their servants being in the family way. I told him I should consult my people about the matter, but it appeared to me to be a case for police inves<lb/>tigation. He begged me not to do so. He said they need know nothing whatever about it. I told him I would go to my relatives after leaving the surgery. (I meant any mother and father.) He asked me not to do so, and then asked me if I would see him if he called on me on the following day, Saturday. I told him he could please himself about it. He stated that all doctors did this, and I told him I was very glad that there were some re<lb/>spectable doctors. Miss Jones was present the whole of the time. I deny that on the Friday I asked him to procure abor<lb/>tion, and that if he did not I would put it on him. Dr. Sum<lb/>merskill did not come on the Saturday but on the Monday, Feb<lb/>ruary 5, at 10 o'clock. Miss Jones let him in, and I saw him. He asked me how the case was going on. I said I could tell him nothing whatever about it. I told him the case would be placed in the hands of a solicitor, that I was taking their advice, as I thought it was a case for the police. He begged me to know who this solicitor was, but I did not tell him, and would hold no further conversation with him. I bad not seen Mr.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110202"/>
               <p>Mullis. I did not see him till next day. I do not recollect any thing more on the Monday only that he said he was ready to carry out what he offered before with respect to Miss Jones, and I told him it was not likely after the statement he made about ladies taking in servants in the family way that he would be trusted because it thawed his character. When he said he wished to carry out what he promised I told him he was not ft fit and proper man to act as a doctor. I refused to listen any more to him. I saw Mr. Mullis on the following Tuesday at Romford, and they wrote the letter of February 6, 1906. I left the matter in the hands of the solicitors for six weeks, and Miss Jones made a further statement about Dr. Summer—skill having used instruments, and on March 17 I wrote this letter before I went to the police: "On my solicitor's advice I am placing my signed statement of our interviews, with Miss Jones's statement, and other proofs, against you, in the hands of the police authorities at once. I consulted a local doctor explaining the case." The doctor referred to in the letter is Dr. Barton, of Chadwell Heath, who was here yesterday. I went to Dr. Barton on Mr. Mullis's advice. He said, "Any respectable doctor would have to inform the police of the case, as it was a very serious matter." At the time I wrote the letter I honestly believed all that Miss Jones said to me to be true, and I still believe it. No notice was taken of the letter, and there was no reply. On March 21 I went to Ilford Police Sta<lb/>tion, and saw the station sergeant acting at the time. I took the statements with me, the statement I made and the statement Alice Jones made, and what was said to Dr. Summerskill. I explained that I wrote out both my own statement and that of Miss Jones. I signed mine, and she signed hers. A detective officer was sent to my place the same evening. He saw both Miss Jones and myself, and read out the statements to both of us, and asked us if that was our signature, and informed me I should have to be at Stratford Police Court the next morning. I went there with Miss Jones, and saw some magistrates, and they had these statements handed to them. The result was that owing to the delay in applying for a warrant for Dr. Sum<lb/>merskill's arrest the warrant was not granted, but the magis<lb/>trates gave me permission to apply again. I was taken by the police officer to Mr. Sharman the next morning, and the matter was left in his hands. A communication was made by the police to the Public Prosecutor, and the police had the medicinewhich Miss Jones had given to her. They came down on the Sunday following the application to the police court, and took away the medicine. I had left two bottles of medicine and one box con<lb/>taining three pills. There was no reply to Sharman's letter for a month, and at the beginning of May there were romours about Dr. Summerskill leaving for South Africa, which I be<lb/>lieved, and it was publicly known.

               <p>about Chadwell Heath or Ilford for several days, and I believed he had gone, and I determined to place the matter before the college of Surgeons and the College of Physicians, and I wrote the letter of May 9 to Airs. Summerskill. I wrote that letter because I thought it only right and proper that Mrs. Summer<lb/>skill should know about the case if the was ignorant of it then. I received a letter from Mrs. Summerskill, in which she said the was aware of my attempt to blackmail her husband. Then a bastardy summons was issued on May 24, and on June 9 I wrote this further letter: "Sir,—Mist Jones is so far advanced that she will leave here the first thing on Monday morning and be away for her confinement unless other arrangements are Bade between now and Monday evening. When the C.I.D. In<lb/>spector came to see me the day he saw the Public Prosecutor respecting this case he gave me report and information with regard to bringing the matter before the Medical Council and having you stopped from practising at a doctor. I have copies of statements, reports of police proceedings, etc., ready for the purpose, and hope to have further evidence to include with time. Of course, if people have reason they will talk, and I and friends have been only too pleased to listen to get informa<lb/>tion and evidence which may prove useful. I took the matter up on Miss Jones's behalf out of no personal ill-will to you, and only after the admissions and offers you made, as she has no parents to see her through her trouble, and has been in my employ 91/2 years, during which time she has kept herself respect<lb/>able. You admitted you had got her in trouble and was pre<lb/>pared to do what you could for her and act as a gentleman. If you do not act as a man you must expect to be treated according to your conduct, and I am going to carry this matter to an end in a legal and thorough manner without fear or favour. I gave you fair and straightforward notice of all steps which were being taken in the matter, and you have had proof that I do not bluff, neither can I be bluffed like other people." I got no answer to that letter, and Miss Jones went to the infirmary at Romford. On June 13 I wrote again to Dr. Summerskill: "Mist Jones left here and was admitted as an inmateof the Romford Infir<lb/>mary yesterday, after going before the guardians and giving them full particulars of the case. I informed them that I was going to place the matter before the Medical Council and alto what steps had already been taken. I did not feel justified in going to the expense of sending her elsewhere to bring your child into the world and having it put right away afterwards. Had you Been a man at all it was your duty to do to in a dif<lb/>ferent way to what you have offered. If Miss Jonet it still in the infirmary on Monday next, I stall forward documents, etc., to the Medical Council. I shall be communicating with Mr. Clarkson, solicitor, of 9, Ironmonger Lane, E.C., in a few days."</p>

               <p>Then I had the summons in this matter; it went before the magistrates, and I was commuted for trial.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is not correct to say that this woman was in my employment before my wife left me. When she entered my employment she came as my housekeeper. At that time I was not making a decent income as a grocer. I was earning a fair living, not a decent income—not sufficient for my needs. It may have been 30s. to £2 a week. I gave up the grocer's business because I was not satisfied with the income, although it was sufficient to get along upon. It is wrong to say that I gave it up because I was not making a profit. If the grocery business had been profitable I would have continued it. I have never left the house at Chadwell Heath. I am still there, carrying on the business of a printer. I have been pressed for money during the last few months, only since this case came on. I have had railway and other expenses to meet in order to obtain evidence. I have not 'had the solicitor's bill yet. bat I have had to pay cash on account. I have not paid Curridge and Mullis' anything. Before February 5 I was a prosperous man; I am sure of that. I ceased to be prosperous owing to this case. I can hardly say that I have been hard up. There has been a difference in my income this year since this case has been on. I admit that there has been a distress for rent in my house. When I required money for this case I let two or three weeks go by, and the landlord put in a distress, but that was paid out immediately. No one has found any money to pay Mr. Sharman except relatives. I did not know that before or since she came into my service she was guilty of immorality, therefore it was impossible that she could have commaunicated gonorrhoea to me. I have never seen Dr. Summerokill but on one occasion professionally, and that was for ptomaine poison<lb/>ing. It is not true that I went to his surgery in order to be treated, and any entries that he made in his books to that effect are absolutely false. Jones never said anything to me about her menstrual periods having ceased, and her suspicions this she was in the family way until the night before February 1. I never heard that on the night before February 1 she asked Dr. Sum'merskill to do something to relieve her of the consequeneet of her pregnancy. I did not advise her to ask the doctor. I should have stopped her if I had known she was going to do so. It is not true that when I saw Dr. Summerskill on the following day I asked him to give medicine or perform an operation to prevent the consequences of the pregnancy. It is not true that when he refused I said to him, "I will make you pay for this." I never used those words or anything similar to them. The statement of Dr. Summerskill is absolutely false that when I asked him to do this he refused and I threatened him. It is not true that when he called on me on the 5th he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110205"/>
               <p>asked me whether I had carried out any of my threats. He said, "How is the matter going on?" That question had no reference to any threats of mine; it was referring to what he wanted to do for Miss Jones. It had nothing to do with any refusal to procure abortion at my request. He never refused such a thing, and it was never asked. I told Mr. Mullis what Miss Jones had told me about Dr. Summerskill. I also asked him for his advice, and whether he thought it was a case of rape. I did not know the technicalities of law, otherwise I would not have gone to a solicitor. I did not ask the solicitor's advice as to any compensation; it was never mentioned. The only advice that was required was as to whether it was a charge of rape. I know that when a man is charged with rape he is given into custody. I gave no specific instructions for this letter to Dr. Summerskill. I knew that Mr. Mullis had a reply to the letter he had written. I do not know anything about what Mr. Mul<lb/>lis's firm had done: it was left in their hands. If they have done nothing that is how the matter rests. I do not say that between February 7 and March 17 I had not been to Mr. Mullis. I had been going backwards and forwards. I did not know that Dr. Summerskill's solicitor, had required a statement in writing as to what the charge at. They told me a reply had come to their letter, but they did not tell me what it was and I did not ask. On Mr. Mullis's advice I went to the police and consulted Dr. Barton some weeks afterwards. I deny that as I could get nothing from Dr. Summerskill I thought I would put pressure on him by writing to Him that letter of March 17. There never has been any call on Dr. Summerskill for anything. It is false to say I have been after him for money. When he made this offer I refused it on Miss Jones's behalf. He said he would get her into a situation. When he made the statement that there were plenty of ladies who would take a pregnant woman it made me suspicious of him. I was shocked. No re<lb/>spectable woman would take a servant knowing her to be in the family way. I have not heard that as soon as the letter was received by Dr. Summerskill he consulted his solicitors with a view to putting the matter before the police. I changed soli<lb/>citors because I wanted somebody more energetic in my inte<lb/>rests. I told Mr. Sharman all the facts. I did not tell Mr. Sharman to write a letter charging Dr. Summerskill with having committed rape at that time. Mr. Sharman took that course, after knowing that the case had been before the magistrates and the warrant refused. There were rumours going about that Dr. Summerskill had gone to South Africa, and I asked several people whether Dr. Summerskill had been seen. It was the local rumour that he had gone to South Africa. When I wrote to Mrs. Summerskill and said "I am aware that) he left for South Africa on Monday morning," I believed it to be the truth. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110206"/>
               <p>took that simply from information received. I wrote this let<lb/>ter to Mrs. Summerskill because I thought it right and proper that a wife should know how her husband was carrying on, and Dr. Summerskill is notorious down there, of course. It is not true that I have told people of him and caused all the evil. I could say more. I wanted to give the doctor fair and square notice of what I was doing, so that he should not say that I was dirty or underhanded. That is the reason that, having placed my affairs in the hands of Mr. Sharman I still wrote to a person that I should have had no communication with. It may have been an indiscretion to write to Dr. or Mrs. Summerskill, but I looked at it in a different light. I wanted to give them notice so that they could not say I was doing anything underhanded.</p>

I came out, and found prisoner bending over the counter with three cakes of chocolate in his hand. On seeing me he dropped them on the counter. Directly I saw him I recognised his face, and said, "I have repeatedly told you for the past six months to keep out</p>

               <p>of this shop,' as I had noticed that several other things had been taken. He said, "Can you assist an old soldier?" I kept him under observation. He went into a second-hand clothier's next door and into a draper's over the road. I gave him into custody. He always had a black bag in his hand, as he had on this occasion.</p>

He said I had been continually in the shop for the last six months; it is not six months ago since I was libe<lb/>rated from Brixton Prison.

                  </hi>, 22, North Woolwich Road. I was on duty on July 30 at half-past 11 in the engine room, and heared a knocking on the door. I crossed over to see what it was, and on the way I met Gibbs, the gate man. We went to the stores, taking a lamp with us, and burst the door open. We found three men there. I asked them what, they were doing, and they knocked the lamp on the ground and threw some metal at us Before the light was extinguished I recognised prisoner. One of them came at me with a plate, and I put my arm up and it hit me on the head, and they all rushed out. At 2 o'clock I saw prisoner at the police station in charge.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I cannot say whether prisoner had been em<lb/>ployed by the company, but he is the man I saw.</p>

                  </hi>, 148, Beokton Road, watchman. On July 50 I went round the premises at nine o'clock and found everything in order. There is a warehouse at the corner of the block of buildings which overlook the road. The window was not covered up. Later on I received a communication from Craven, and we went to the warehouse. He kicked the door open, and three men were in there. We had one light with us, and I recognised prisoner. I have no doubt about it He had been employed at Odhams' Wharf a day or two now and then. I swear to his identity. He would not know the premises much. When Craven kicked the door open they made a rush at us, and put our light out and got away in the dark<lb/>nem. There was light enough to see the features of the men. I sew prisoner again on July 31 at 2.15 a.m. He was brought in by the police. There was a sack over the window I referred to above, so that we should not see them in there.</p>
               <p>To the Court. I am certain I saw prisoner. I knew him before.'</p>

                  </hi>, P.C. 287 E. I was on duty on the night of July 30, and was called to Odhams' Wharf, and received a cer<lb/>tain communication. I searched round the outer stables, and found prisoner in a railway van, 30 or 40 yards from the wharf. Prisoner said, "I walked up from Woolwich, I was tired, and I lay down to rest." He was identified almost on the spot. He was not searched till he got to the charge-room. He was not asleep when I found him; he was pretending.</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">POTTER</hi>, 633 K. On July 31, in consequence of information received, last witness and I searched the premises. We went to this line of trucks. At the particular part of the warehouse wall opposite the line of trucks there was a low part of the wall. I took one line, and last witness took the other, and he brought him out of the truck. Gibbs and Craven iden<lb/>tified ham as one of the men. I examined the premises, and found a sack placed over the window which faced the yard. There was another window on the opposite side; that was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110209"/>
               <p>opened from the inside. There were bars across it, but they could pass the gun metal through to Bell Lane. The look was an old-fashioned one, and easy to open with a key. In my opinion that was the way in which entrance was obtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">H. WOOD</hi>, foreman to Odhams' Manure and Chemical Com<lb/>pany. On July 30 the warehouse was securely fastened and nobody but the watchman had any right to be on the premises. It contained engineer's fittings and gun-metal bearings of the value of £100, to an easily movable character. After a cer<lb/>tain communication I visited the warehouse, and found that a certain number of these bearings were displaced, and there was a window which was covered with a sack, and I found that the door was tampered with. I missed a gun-metal bearing belong<lb/>ing to a pneumatic separator. I am able to speak to its iden<lb/>tity because it was for a certain job which was done the week previously. It had been juat purchased for this particular job. It was worth 5s. I found it in the factory, but some distance away from the warehouse adjoining some railway gates.</p>
               <p>To the Court. It was on the premises. I would not like to say whether prisoner has been employed by our firm, as we employ a good deal of casual labour.</p>
               <p>Prisoner hanaed in the following abatement as hi a defence: On Monday evening, July 30, I went for a walk as for as South Woolwich to see if I could find out where my sister Rosie had moved to. Not ceing, able to find her I walked back again, and when I got between Allendorf a Guano Works and the Alkana Soda Works—there is a siding which runs alongside of these two factories—I saw an empty railway truck and both side doors were down. I got in the truck because I had a glass or two of beer and foolishly spent my lodging money. Another reason was because had got no more money for my lodging. This is the whole truth why it happened. I was found in the empty truck. This said truck was some 50 or 60 yards this side of the firm which Brings ibis charge. Coming from South Wool<lb/>wich, I had not got as far as their premises. It was about quarter-past eleven when I got into the empty truck. About half-past twelve a police-constable got up in the truck and I woke up. He said, "What are you doing here? I said I had been to Woolwich and that I had a drop of beer. He said, "You will have to come to the office with me." I got up and willingly went to the office with him. I can truthfully say that I had not been on those premises previous to this not before me and the police-constable went up to the once together. I pleaded guilty to being found in the empty truck, but not guilty to the charge of warehouse-breaking, which I am innocent of. I was taken down to North Woolwich Police Station by the police-constable, who had the case of finding me in the empty track; This would be about 1.30. Not one of the witnesses came down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190609110210"/>
               <p>to the police-station, not before some hours afterwards. All the police-constable told his worship was of finding me in the empty railway truck, and that he did not think I had had much beer, and he also told his worship that the empty truck was about 50 yards away from the firm. When the charge came on for hear<lb/>ing I pleaded "Not guilty," as each witness gave his evidence. I was remanded till August 7, and one of the witnesses told his worship that I had worked for the firm, which I absolutely denied, and I told his worship that I had not worked there one minute in my life, which is quite true. I can truthfully say that I am not guilty of the charge or know anything about it whatso<lb/>ever, only of being found in the empty railway truck. Since I have been detained I have written to my mother asking her if she would kindly send me my sister Rose's address. I have had a reply. The address is 27, Glenside Road, Plumstead. I have the letter in my pocket. I should not have had to walk about all night farad I been able to find my sister out. I was expecting to go to work on the Tuesday night. Verdict,

                  </hi>, ship's fireman. On the morning of August 6 I was in Victoria Dock Road, about half-past 12, an my way Home. Prisoner came behind me, got hold of me by the throat,</p>

               <p>and took 3d. oat of my pocket On a constable coming up pri<lb/>soner let go of me, and I fell. I law his face as I turned round, and I am certain this is the man. He threw down the 3d., and I picked it up. I suffered very little physical injury.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. I did not notice the constable pick up a hat from the ground. I was sober enough to recog<lb/>nise you. although I had been drinking and was a bit muddled.</p>

                  </hi>, P.C. 499 K. On this morning I was on duty in Hack Road; prosecutor pasted me about 12.50; he was sober. He had passed me about 30 yards when I saw prisoner and another man run up behind him and push him down; I ran towards them and they ran away; I heard the sound of coin falling. I lost the other man, but caught this prisoner; I am certain he was one of the two men; I did not lose sight of him. He had no cap on at the time.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I do not say it was you who pushed prose<lb/>cutor down; I did not say that at the police court Prosecutor did not say when I took you to him, "Is this one of the men?" The cap produced is the one I picked up at the place. I said to you at the time, "Is this your cap?" and you said, "No, my cap is a light one."</p>
               <p>Sergeant <hi rend="smallCaps">BARNICOTT</hi>, 34 K. I was at the station when prose<lb/>cutor and prisoner were brought in. Prosecutor, in prisoner's hearing, related the story of the assault, and said he had not lost anything, as he had pioked the, coppers up; prisoner said, "You hear what he says, sergeant" Andrews produced the cap; I said to prisoner, "Is this yours?" He said, "No, mine is a light one." Later on prisoner asked me to go to his wife and ask her to be in court in the morning.</p>
               <p>To Prisoner. I was not called at the police court; the solicitor did not think it necessary.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On the night of August 5 I had been lying on the bed reading, and I fell asleep. I woke just after 12; my wife was out; it was all dark; I felt for my cap and could not find it As I was only going to the top of the street to my mother-in-law's, I went out without a cap. My wife was not at her mother's place, and I went on to my brother's house, five or six minutes' walk. I was about six yards away from prosecutor when the constable came up, and said, "Wasn't it you pushed a man down there?" I said, "No, take me back and see." We went to the prosecutor; the policeman said to him, "Is this the man?" He replied, "I do not know; they came behind me and I am not sure."</p>
