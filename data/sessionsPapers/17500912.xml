I do confess my guilt, and submissively rely on the favour of the court to intercede for my life. - My Lord, I have thus much to say in alleviation of my crime, that this is the first time I ever appear'd before a court of Justice in an ignominious manner; that a case of necessity urged me to commit the fact I am charged with, and that my heart is full of sorrow and contrition for it. If therefore your Lordship, or Mr. Recorder, will be pleased to report me in this favourable light to his Majesty, or the Lords in power, it will, I hope, be the happy means of inducing them to extend their clemency towards me; but if I am so unfortunate as not to be thought an object worthy their compassion, I trust that the Lord of Heaven and Earth will have mercy on my soul.</p>

After I had told the money he put it into a bag and carried it up one pair of stairs into a sore room; that afternoon he went into the country. The prisoner used to be employed by the maid the fore part of the day to assist in the house; it was reported she was married on the Saturday in the afternoon, and in that affair she had expended 3 l. 6 s. 9 d. We went and took her up on the Monday following; she denied knowing any thing of the matter before justice Burry, but on the Tuesday morning she told me, she shook the scrutore (Mr. Lawton told me, he did not know whether he put the money into the till, or the scrutore) and the money fell down behind from a hole which there was in the back part of it, and she took it up; whether this hole was done by her, or some body else, I know not. She did not name any particular pieces. I ask'd her what she had done with it, she said, most of the money was lost, with the certificate, coming back from being married, in a coach.</p>

I had an information that the prisoner had stole them. He lives in Gravel-lane, Houndsditch. He was taken up the 23d of July. He would neither acknowledge or deny the taking them. I searched Mrs. Holland's house, but could not find them. After that she sent two of them by a woman who dropp'd them by Mr. Winn's door.</p>

               <p>F. Holland. The prisoner asked me if I would buy two gowns. I told him my husband was in confinement in Ludgate, and I could not spare the money. He said he had them to dispose of for a person who wanted money. He said one would fit me, and the other my daughter; he asked 12 s. for them. I had but 4 s. and 6 d. I gave him that in part of pay. Then I sent my ring, and borrow'd 6 s. upon that, and paid him the remainder.</p>

There were two other men with him, they got behind me; he took my hat and wig and toss'd them to the other men; after that he put his left hand to my left hand pocket, and took out a shilling. After he had put his hand in my pocket some time, the others put my wig before my eyes; then I said, gentlemen, you have no occasion to blind me, I have but one shilling about me, and if it was ten times as much I would give it you; then they ordered me to go along, and not to come or look back. Then when I was got from them, I called to a watchman to come to my assistance, and after that another; but they did not care to go with me after them. Then came Mr. Chennery to go over the fields, I told him if he did, he would be robb'd as I had been. He said he must go across the fields. I called to some more watchmen and told them the affair; one of them had got a sailor's jacket on; I asked him to lend it me to put on, that the men might not know me again; he did, and put on my coat; then one of them lent me a hat, but none of them would lend me a staff. Mr. Chennery said he would go along with me. We went together, and the watchmen followed us. When I came betwixt the posts, I saw them all three sitting upon the Wall that parts the middle fields from the quarters. When I came near them, I pull'd the jacket by the fore parts, and pulled it close round me, and held my head down; they asked us what we wanted; Mr. Chennery said money and manners; he repeated it twice. I knew the prisoner to be the man that stood before me, and robb'd me, as soon as I saw him again; then they said, can't we sit here upon the wall for all you. Mr. Chennery said, and can't we stand here for all you. They began then to whistle, and the other two jump'd from the wall and run away. Then said I to the prisoner you are the man that robbed me, and you shall not go if the others do. Then I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120005"/> took hold of him, and left him to the care of Mr. Chinnery, while I ran after the others. When I came back, they were both on the ground together, having had a Scuffle; then the Watchmen came up, and they took him to the watchhouse. I ran over the fields after the other two, but could not find them; it was a moon light night, and there were six lamps round the place; I am very certain he is the man that robb'd me; he was taken in less than a quarter of an hour after he robb'd me. He was searched in the watch-house, and a single shilling was found in his pocket; there were no arms found upon him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going up Grubstreet between 10 and 11 o'clock, and met a gentleman like man that seemed to be in liquor; he asked me the way to Bishopsgate-street; I told him he was going wrong, saying he must go back again. He asked me to shew him the way, I did not much care to go along with him; he said if I would, he should be obliged to me. I went with him; he asked me to drink part of a pot of beer. We went to Skinner-street, and drank four full pots of beer together. When I parted with him it was betwixt 12 and 1 o'clock. I was coming home. I had occasion to ease myself under the wall in Moorfields. There came three or four Men, and looked over the wall; up came my prosecutor, and two or three more. I asked what they wanted; they said money and manners. I said I had no money. Then the prosecutor said to me, you are the man that robb'd me; and insisted I had got a pistol about me. They searched me, and found nothing upon me. I lost 5 d. out of my pocket.</p>

I went backwards to get a pail of water, and when I returned, he, my apron, and money were all gone. He was taken up the same night at the George, on Saffron-hill. There were 26 s. found upon him.

One person held a pistol to my head; another had a hanger or a cutlass. They damn'd my eyes and limbs, and swore they would blow my brains out, if I would not give them my money. I had a javelin screwed on the end of my walking stick (it went on with a socket, the blade about nine inches long) but the scabbard happen'd to be on. I made a resistance, and swore I would not give them one shilling. Then one of them said, Fisk him. They took 2 s. and my hat, and went off.

               <p>Harsel. From my own knowledge. There was alamp within two doors where I was robb'd One of them had a green waistcoat on with gold button-holes (such as Rowland has on now.) I judge by the size of the men; they are the size of two of them. When I went into Bridewell, Ball pulled off his hat to me as soon as I came into the place; I ask'd who he was?

As we were coming from Mile-end turnpike to Bethnal Green, two men rode up on the off-side the chaise ; one of them bid me stop, or he would blow my brains out; he had a pistol in his hand. The other rode round on the other side of the chaise : then he who bid me stop, bid me hold my head the other way, or else he'd blow my brains out : (then I knew his voice). He rode up to Mr. Cave, and d - d him, and put the pistol towards him. I heard him ask him for money, saying, money he must have. I turn'd my head round and looked at him. I heard the money chink, but could not see it, it was so dark.

I have known him three or four years: He was book-keeper to a Waggon on that comes in at the Sarazen's head, on Snow-hill. As to the other prisoner, Theobald, I have nothing against him, but Dangerfield's own words. When he was taken up, he said, he was in company with Theobald's at that time. On thursday was sen'night I was going by the Half-moon in Smithfield, I saw Dangerfield drinking in a public room. I went in, and drank part of one pot of beer with him. I tapp'd him by the shoulder, and called him cut, and asked him, if he remember'd last Sunday-night, about stopping a four-wheel'd chaise near Mile-end turnpike. And he said, did you drive it ? I said yes. Then said he, My dear eyes, be righteous to me, my life lies in your hands. I am sure he is the man that robbed Mr. Cave, if there is a man living in this place.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination he said, it was a dark rainy night; the prisoner's hat was not put down; he had on a neat coat; that he did not think proper to blow it, though he said at that time he knew him, till he could have an opportunity of taking him himself; he believes Dangerfield did not know him when he did the robbery.</p>

            . I am a printer, and live in the Old-Baily; I have seen the two prisoners at the bar twice before, once the 12th of August, the other time in Bridewell: On the 12th of August I saw them at Holloway, at the Horse and Groom; they came in there about a quarter before 7 o'clock in the evening, they got off their horses; whether they came up or down the road thither I know not. The man of the house was fuddled, he brought them out some cold sowl, they call'd for some wine; I remember I had some discourse with them about the Foundling-Hospital, I had been there to see the christening; I came away from thence 17 minutes, by the clock, wanting of 8 o'clock in the evening, and I believe when my wife and I got into the chaise it might be within 10 minutes of 8. I left them there, and their horses were then in the stable.</p>

            . I work in London, my family live at Hounslow; I set out from London late on the 25th of August; the prisoner at the bar came up to me betwixt eleven and twelve o'clock, with his soldier's coat turn'd inside out; he said, he was going to take a deserter; this was betwixt the half way house and Kensington. We went in together at the Cock ale-house at Kensington and drank, then I went forward towards Hounslow, he went with me; I went cross <placeName id="t17500912-16-crimeloc78">Turnham-green, there is a lane leads from that green to Branford</placeName>

I had out of a shilling at Kensington, when I paid<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120008"/> for a pint of beer. I collar'd him, and we were down in a dry ditch together; we got up again, then I cry'd out thieves, murder, &amp;c. at this time I judg'd it to be between twelve and one o'clock. I was down again, he throatled me, and said if I spoke a word he would murder me outright. I put my hand in my pocket when he was upon me and got my knife; I thought I had done his business for him, I stuck him in two or three places of his body. We got up, he got me down once more; we got up again, then said he to me, you have murder'd me; said I, I believe I have. Said he, notwithstanding I insist upon your money, then I held a sixpence to him and he took it; in the scussle the child's coat that I had on my arm was lying in the middle of the lane, he took that also; he went for London, and I on to Hounslow. I imagined he would drop by the way with the wounds he received, and reported what had happen'd. I returned in the evening, and call'd upon his comrade, where we had drank together at Kensington, he told me the prisoner would be upon guard next morning at ten o'clock, but I found my instructions were false. I went to Captain Salter's and left word what had happen'd, and that the soldier who had attack'd me was dangerously wounded. He took pains to over-hale his men to see who was wounded; it being blown abroad the prisoner was taken; the other witness can give a farther account.</p>
               <p>Richard Nixon. I am Serjeant of the first regiment of guards; about the 27th of last month the prisoner at the bar declar'd he had been in pursuit of a deserter, and had been wounded in two parts of his body; the prosecutor coming and making complaint to the Adjutant of the regiment, and describing the parts of the body he had wounded the soldier in who had robb'd him; the Adjutant sent for me, and said such a man had been wounded, meaning the prisoner, and ordered me to put him in the Savoy. I met with him about ten o'clock at night, I think the 28th of last month. I told him he was charg'd with a highway robbery; he said, he had been wounded in a scuffle with a deserter. I put him into the Savoy, the next morning I took the prosecutor with me, he said the prisoner was the very man. This coat was brought by another soldier before the justice. The prosecutor swore to it as his property, which the prisoner took from him.</p>
               <p>Q. to the prosecutor. Where did you wound the person you say robb'd you?</p>
               <p>Jenkins. About the breast, I believe, in two or three places.</p>
               <p>Nixon. He had a scratch with something like a pin near his right breast, I examined him no farther.</p>

            . The prosecutor is a lodger of mine, he told me when he return'd on Sunday night just the same he has now. I went along with him to find out the prisoner, and before the justice I saw two or three little cuts on the prisoner's breast, as large as a knife might be imagined to cut. The little coat is the prosecutor's property.</p>

               <p>I drank a pint of beer with that man; we walk'd very lovingly on together till he call'd me thief-taker, to go to take away a man's life for 20 s. as I was going to take a deserter; said I, it is doing the king's duty; he pull'd out his knife and stuck me, than he ran away as fast as he could, and I return'd back to London.</p>
               <p>Nixon, and four other persons, gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I live in High-Holborn ; I keep a brandy-shop there. About 8 o'clock that morning, the prisoner came into my house with this frock and waistcoat in her lap. She told me she was along with a man all night, and he gave her no money, and she brought his cloths away ; after that she told me they were her husband's cloaths, and she would go and pawn them, for he had pawn'd all her's; she proffer'd to leave them with me for 2 s. and 6 d. I did not ask her whether she wanted to sell or pawn them for that money. I sent for a constable, and had her taken up. The cloaths were carried to the constable's house, and by him advertised on the wed nesday; and the prosecutor came and owned them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been at work in the country; I came to town and received a guinea of a master of mine at Brumpton ; he is since dead. I met a woman, she ask'd me if I would buy these cloaths; I said I don't care to buy a pig in a poke; so desired to see them. She ask'd me a guinea for them. I gave her 16 s. and two pots of beer. Then a soldier laid hold of me, and said, you bitch, come and give me some gin. He took me to this man's shop; they took my cloaths. I went to fetch a constable to have some recompence; then they brought another constable, and took me to the round-house.</p>

I got a warrant for her, and took her before the justice, and she was cleared. I turn'd her away and search'd her bundle.

I gave her leave to go amongst her friends; I followed her, and found there she bore a very bad character. I found some of my things and took her up. Then she confessed every thing and cleared the other girl; so she was discharged, and is at my house now.

            . On the 26th of June, I was passenger in the Salisbury flying coach, going thither. There were four gentlemen and one gentlewoman with me. Betwixt Turnham Green and Brentford, betwixt the five and six mile stone in the parish of Chiswick, between 1 and 2 o'clock in the morning, a man came up to the side of the coach and put his pistol in, demanding our money; at the same time calling to his companion who lagg'd behind to come up. Then came up another person. They were both arm'd and mask'd. The second acted but little; he rather sat on horseback as a guard. I gave about twelve or fourteen shillings to the man that came up first. They declared that should not do, and ordered us out of the coach into the high-way. They took six shillings out of another pocket of mine, and four penny worth of halfpence out of my breeches pocket, and threaten'd to blow my brains out for concealing it. He on horseback I believe threaten'd as much as the other. After this, the person who came up first, declared he would see what was in the boot of the coach, and accordingly jump'd up, and by the help of the coachman, took out two cloak bags; one of which was my property. They made the coachman help them up before them, and each rode off with one. He mentions the goods in this cloak bag as in the indictment. Some of these things were found again in the prisoner's lodgings. I found there a light perriwig, three pair of stockings, a pair of double channel pumps, a handkerchief, two cannisters without tea. They were found on the 27th of July, the day the prisoner was taken, in his trunk, and they are my property, taken out of my cloakbag. I found also at Mr. Loader's a cloth coat and breeches, and waistcoat, with the lace stripp'd off. The portmanteau was brought home three weeks after, said to be found in Kensington Gravel-pits. There were also two guineas in money.</p>

            . The prisoner came himself to me, and desir'd I would come and look at some things he had to dispose of; I think this was the 19th of July, he liv'd with one Mr. Dunn in St. James's-street; he shew'd me a light colour'd cloth coat and breeches, a waistcoat with the lace ripped off, I bought them of him with other things. Mr. Higden came to my shop some time after, and found the things lying on the counter and own'd them. I went and got a warrant for the prisoner in the name of Macleane, the name he left with me of his own hand writing, for a direction for me to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120011"/> come to see the cloaths; he was taken, I was with him before the justice and heard him confess taking these things from the coach, with the other things.</p>
               <p>Mr. Higden. These things were advertised in the publick papers several times, and there is the perriwig maker that made the wig now in court.</p>
               <p>Justice Lidiard. The prisoner and the things were brought before me, he denied the fact at first, he said it I would be of any service to him he would make a confession. I told him I could not admit him as an evidence, but if he had a mind to make a voluntary confession I would hear it, but I would not at all press him to it; I gave him an hour's time to do it; I went down stairs and up again, and then he told me he had committed this and several other robberies in company with one Plunket; I bid him recollect, as nearly as he could, all the robberies he had committed, and come again the next day; he brought it me the next day in writing, I did not ask him to sign it, he gave it me to read, and said the contents of that paper were true. I left the paper in his hands and never ask'd it of him. He confess'd the taking the two portmanteaus, and among the rest, the things that lay then before him. He confess'd this when I went to him at the Gate-house, and likewise when he was examined by me the first of August.</p>
               <p>The prisoner desired the court would indulge him to read his defence, which was to this purport:</p>
               <p>'' My Lord, I am persuaded from the candour and indulgence shewn me in the course of my trial, that your lordship will hear me with patience, and make allowance for the confusion I may shew before an awful assembly, upon so solemn an occasion.</p>
               <p>Your lordship will not construe it vanity in me, at this time, to say, that I am the son of a divine of the kingdom of Ireland, well known for his zeal and affection to the present royal family, and happy government; who bestowed an education upon me becoming his character, of which I have in my hand a certificate from a noble lord, four members of parliament, and several justices of peace for the country where I was born, and received my education.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the late French war, my lord, I came to London, with a design to enter into the military service of my king and country; but unexpected disappointments obliged me to change my resolution; and having married the daughter of a reputable trademan, to her fortune I added what little I had of my own, and entered into trade in the grocery way, and continued therein till my wife died. I very quickly after her death found a decay in trade, arising from an unavoidable trust reposed in servants; and fearing the consequence, I candidly consulted some friends, and by their advice, sold off my stock, and in the first place honestly discharged my debts, and proposed to apply the residue of my fortune in the purchase of some military employment, agreeable to my first design.</p>
               <p>During my application to trade, my lord, I unhappily became acquainted with one Plunket, an apothecary, who, by his account of himself, induced me to believe he had travelled abroad, and was possessed of cloaths and other things suitable thereto, and prevailed on me to employ him in attending on my family, and to lend him money to the amount of 100 l. and upwards.</p>
               <p>When I left off trade, I pressed Plunket for payment, and after receiving, by degrees, several sums, he proposed, on my earnestly insisting that I must call in all debts owing to me, to pay me part in goods and part in money.</p>
               <p>These very cloaths with which I am now charged, my lord, were cloaths he brought to me to make sale of, towards payment of my debt, and accordingly, my lord, I did sell them, very unfortunately, as it now appears; little thinking they were come by in the manner. Mr. Higden hath been pleased to express, whose word and honour are too well known to doubt the truth.</p>
               <p>My lord, as the contracting this debt between Plunket and myself was a matter of a private nature, so was the payment of it; and therefore, it is impossible for me to have the testimony of any one single witness to these facts, which (as it is an unavoidable misfortune) I hope, and doubt not, my lord, that your lordship and the gentlemen of the jury will duly weigh.</p>
               <p>My lord, I cannot avoid observing to your lordship, Is it probable, nay, is it possible, that if I had come by those cloaths by dishonest means, I should be so imprudent as to bring a man to my lodgings at noon-day to buy them, and give him my name and place of residence, and even write that name and residence myself in the Salesman's book? It seems to me, and I think must to every man, a madness that no one, with the least share of sense, could be capable of.</p>
               <p>My lord, I have observed in the course of Mr. Higden's evidence, he hath declared, he could not be positive either to my face or person, the defect of which, I humbly presume, leaves a doubt of the certainty of my being one of the two persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120012"/>My lord, it is very true, when I was first apprehended, the surprize confounded me, and gave me the most extraordinary shock; it caused a delirium and confusion in my brain, which rendered me incapable of being myself, or knowing what I said or did; I talked of robberies as another man would do in talking of stories; but, my lord, after my friends had visited me in the Gate-house, and had given me some new spirits, and when I came to be re examined before justice Lediard, and then asked, if I could make any discovery of the robbery, I then alledged that I had recovered my surprize, that what I had talked of before concerning robberies was false and wrong, and entirely owing to a confused head and brain.</p>
               <p>This, my lord, being my unhappy fate; but unhappy as it is, as your lordship is my judge and presumptive council, I submit it, whether there is any other evidence against me than circumstantial.</p>
               <p>First, the selling of the lace and cloaths, which I agree I did; for which I account.</p>
               <p>Second, the verbal confession of a confused brain; for which I account.</p>
               <p>All this evidence I humbly apprehend is but circumstantial evidence.</p>
               <p>It might be said, my lord, that I ought to shew where I was at this time.</p>
               <p>To which, my lord, I answer, that I never heard the time, nor the day of the month, that Mr. Higden was robbed; and, my lord, it is impossible for me, at this juncture, to recollect where I was, and much more to bring any testimony of it.</p>
               <p>My lord, in cases where a prisoner lies under these impossibilities of proof, it is hard, nay, it is very hard, if presumption and intendment may not have some weight on the side of the prisoner. I humbly hope, and doubt not, but that doctrine will not escape your lordship's memory to the jury.</p>
               <p>My lord, I have lived in credit, and have had dealings with manking, and therefore humbly beg leave, my lord, to call about a score to my character, or more, if your lordship pleases; and then, my lord, if in your lordship's opinion the evidence against me should be by law only circumstantial, and the character given of me by my witnesses should be so far satisfactory, as to have equal weight, I shall most willingly and readily submit to the jury's verdict.''</p>
               <p>He call'd nine gentlemen of credit, who gave him a very good character.</p>

            . I was coming from Hampstead on Sunday the 22d of July, about 9 in the evening, in a landau; there were five of us in it, three gentlewomen, Mr. Sherard the attorney, and my self. We insisted that our coachman should keep with the other; yet, for what reason I know not, they divided; the one went to Gray's-Inn Lane, and the other to Hanover Square. I was in the latter; we were stopp'd <placeName id="t17500912-23-crimeloc113">near Fig Lane</placeName>

They d - d their eyes, and said they would blow our brains out, if we di d not deliver our watches and money directly. One cry'd out to me, your watch, your watch, and put his hand into the coach. I gave it him; it was a metal one gilt, with an enamell'd dial plate, made by Delander. The prisoner at the bar was on that side I was on; it was light enough for me to discern him, being a clear night. Then he demanded my money. I told him I had spent that at Hampstead; so they took none from me. The other evidence I believe saw him there, but I will not swear that. When I went first to see the prisoner at the bar, he confess'd to me the whole. One of them was lying down on the side of a heap of gravel.</p>

            . The prisoner and I have committed several robberies together; at this time we lay in weight at the end of Fig Lane about half an hour; we heard the rattling of coaches; said the prisoner do you lie down on the stones. As the coach and landau came on, the landau turned round on the right hand near my legs. The prisoner said, Jack, which shall we follow? I said it is best to follow this, there being the fewest people. There was a great noise in the other coach. I went up and stopp'd the landau. Then Henry Saunders went on the other side; he took this gentleman's watch and brought it to me. I took a diamond ring and another plain one from off a gentlewoman's finger; and Campbel took the money out of a gentleman's pocket, about fourteen of fifteen shillings. I had a brace of pistols, the prisoner a brace, and Campbel one.</p>

               <p>Cockram. I was going to my father who is a watchman at the corner of Fleet Lane, on this Sunday night for the key of the door, The prisoner came behind me, and laid hold of my bundle which I had under my arm; I did not let go but struggl'd with him. I saw his face some time. There was a lamp just behind the place where he knock'd me down, which he did with a stick; and the moon shined too.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sensible when you fell down?</p>
               <p>Cockram. I was, my lord. He took the bundle and ran away; and I got up and run after him, and cried out murder and thieves. The other witness was coming by, and he clasp'd him round the middle, as he ran round one of the houses in the market place. Then he let the bundle fall as soon as he was taken. I took up the bundle and went to my father, who came and took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lie long on the ground?</p>
               <p>Cockram. No, my lord, I lay but a little time. I had fight of the prisoner from the time I was knock'd down, till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Jos. Cooper. I was constable of the night. This lad brought this bundle to the watch-house. His father is a watchman, his stand is at the corner of Fleet Lane, who came with his son and the other witness the 29th of July. There was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120014"/> a stick taken from out of the prisoner's hand; also the bundle produced in court, which Jones, the boy, and the boy's father deposed to; the first two to the robbery, and the other to it, as his property.</p>

               <p>I was coming down the market, I fell over the stick and took it up. I heard the lad cry out, I ran to see what was the matter. He said somebody had knock'd him down. The young fellow said he believed it was me, and took me, and carried me to the watch-house.</p>

I shew'd the apothecary the corrupted blood which came from him when he made water; it looked like blood itself. The apothecary told me it came from the bruises he receiv'd from the men.

            . Last Friday night between 11 and 12 o'clock, I was coming from Ratliff Cross; I had been there at a boat-builder's; a little dog follow'd me into the street; I turn'd myself round to drive him in again; I heard a voice say your money this moment, or else you are a dead man. I was not got above three or four steps from the door; I turn'd round and star'd the man in the face; and thought somebody joak'd with me, being pretty well known in the neighbourhood. I saw his face plain, but had I not taken him that night, it may be I might not have known him again. I started back when I saw a hanger in his hand; he gave an offer at me. He came up to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120015"/> me again, and put his hand to my pocket, and took out my watch, and said, if I stirr'd he would murder me; then he put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out a paper which was only a direction to a gentleman in Red Lion Square. Then he walk'd off quietly, and I walk'd after him; upon recovering my spirits, I cry'd out stop thief. There was a public house open'd ; they heard the cry ; there was a man I knew, one

Where is he? said one of them. Said I, that is the man. Said they, let him run to the d - l, we'll have him. Turning down at a corner, one of them struck up his heels. I came up and took him by the collar, and said this is the man. He never had been out of my view then. One of them wrench'd the cutlass out of his hand; it was drawn. I desir'd Mr. Tanner to take particular charge of him; he was the person I knew. We search'd the prisoner, and he had not the watch about him. We found the sheath of the hanger under his coat.</p>

               <p>Henry Green. I was coachman to Mrs. Selby ; I was coming through Brumpton about six o'clock, or rather before, it was before sun set, on the 30th of August, I saw the prisoner on horse back; when I came within ten yards, pointing his pistol to me, he was sitting still, betwixt me and London; he stood till I came up to him, as I mov'd on, he said, if I did not stop he would blow my brains out; I stop'd immediately, he went up to the coach and demanded the ladies money and their watches. I saw the ladies give their purses out of the coach, then he ask'd them for their watches; I heard Miss Selby say, upon her honour she had left her watch at home. He pull'd a mask over his face a little way, but not till after he had demanded the ladies money. After this he rode off, but not fast, towards Brumpton; I am very certain the prisoner is the man. Last Saturday, about 11 or 12 o'clock, I was standing at my own door in Bow-street, Covent-Garden; the prisoner came by between two men on foot; I knew him, I follow'd him up the street considering what was best to be done; after I had followed him some way I laid hold of his arm, and said, sir. if you please I would speak with you; then I said, sir, you are the man that robb'd a coach between Brumpton and the Bell, and you must go along with me to the justice. I spoke to a man that stood at an apothecary's shop door to assist me; the prisoner told me he would go very quietly with me, and desired I would make no noise. We went imediately to justice Fielding's by ourselves, I told the justice's clark that was the man that had robb'd the coach, &amp;c. He told me I must fetch the ladies to swear to what they had been robb'd of; I fetched the footman, he was behind the coach, who as soon as he enter'd the room, said he would swear that was the man. There were no arms found upon him, he was then committed.</p>

I went with the prisoner to Newgate, to assist Mortimore and Campbel, the two constables; the prisoner said his name was Keys, and that he lodged at one Esquire Westaby's, in North-Street, Red-Lion-Square ; I took a key out of his pocket, he said it belonged to his chest which was where he lodged. We all three of us went to the Esquire's house, there we found the house-keeper we ask'd her if Mr. Keys lodged there, she said she did ; we ask'd if there was not a trunk of his in the house, she said yes; then we told her he was committed to Newgate for a robbery, and we had got the key to search his trunk. She sent for the Esquire's kinsman, who was the prisoner's bedfellow; when he came they went and shew'd us the chest, we found in it a loaded pistol, a blacksilk mask, and two green purses; I carried them to the ladies and they did not own them. The pistol was produced in court.</p>

               <p>Camper. I keep a publick-house upon Wapping Wall, Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of sugar was this you speak of, about three hundred weight?</p>
               <p>Camper. It was coarse sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give them for it per pound?</p>
               <p>Camper. I used to give them twopence farthing or twopence halfpenny per pound, what I gave for that I cannot tell now.</p>
               <p>Q. What might that sugar be worth?</p>
               <p>Camper. At that time the same sort of sugar was worth five pence per pound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that at the same time you bought it?</p>

               <p>Q. How did you know that?</p>
               <p>Camper. They told me they stole it, for people that deal that way make them all alike that trade with them; they used to come at unusual times of the night.</p>

I saw Roof in the yard, so I flung them down at the back door, and said, take hold, I don't know what it is. Then I went to follow Watson, before he got to my house I overtook him. I step'd before him and open'd the cellar window, which I had joyning to my house, we put it down there, then he and I came back to Roof's and opened that bale; there was a bill of parcel of what it cost; Watson had some printed linen chints patterns. Roof was with us then. I cannot say how many pieces of printed linen there were; there were four or five. We ask'd Roof if he could sell them, he said, be believed he could, but said, they must lye some time, saying they would be advertised. We took them out of the wrapper, and put them by, and put the wrapper under his copper and burnt it. Then we went away to my house and opened the other bale, there was 
               <persName id="t17500912-38-person304">

             at length upon one wrapper, I know not which; we found in the other bale six pieces of camblet, four pieces of stuffs striped, and eight pieces of Norwich crapes, we took them out of that wrapper and put them into two sacks, and brought the crape into my house, and left the other things in a sack in the cellar; then Watson went home, I had a suspicion my house might be searched, so the next morning I went down to Mr. Roof's, and desired him to take them. Said he, I will come and fetch them; he came the next morning, I gave him the eight pieces of crape in a sack; about a week after my house and Watson's were searched for these goods; they could not find any thing in either; I saw the officers coming, so I got away. At night I came home, and went down to Roof's, Watson went with me, we told him what had happen'd; he said, he had heard it; so we desired he would take to his house the other part of the goods, he agreed to it, and said, he would send them away; Watson and I carried them to his house that night, at about 11 or 12 o'clock. Now they were all at his house, when we found he could not sell them, we ask'd him to let us have them again, saying, we could sell them. Said he, you may have them again. Said we, we must pay you something. What? said he. We shall not fall out, said we. One morning after this I happened to be at Mr. Newby's house, at King James's stairs, Shadwell, he is a publican, there was Watson and I, Newby and Mr. Harrison, the last lives in Ratclif-high-way, he is a broker. Harrison said, what have you done with your goods? he knew of it, for two or three days after we had taken them he shew'd me the advertisement in the paper concerning them, and said, it was a good booty (this was about a month after) Roof told us he had carried the goods to a place of safety, but would not tell Watson or I where. Harrison lean'd over the table and said, he could sell them all in a day or two.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure he said we?</p>
               <p>Penprise. I am sure he did. We said then, what will you have for selling them? He said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120019"/> ten guineas. We said we will give it; but you must mind and not sell them under price for the take of your ten guineas. He said he would sell them as dear as he could. We said you must mind what you do, for you know they are advertised, and the gentleman is very busy in looking after them. Never fear, said Harrison, we know who to sell them to. I don't know whether both did not say so; but Harrison took most upon him to talk. Mr. Roof would not tell us where they were; but I found afterwards, that they were in Old-street; after we agreed, we parted, and we went to Roof's the next day, in order to get the goods again, and Mr. Roof went with us, and also a porter with a basket. There were Mr. Roof, and I, Watson, and the porter. When we came into Old-street, Roof put us into an alehouse, and said, he'd come to us presently. We sat down and drank for about half an hour, and Roof came to us again, and said the man that has got the goods will have six guineas for warehouse room. We said it was rather too much, two or three were pretty well, and desir'd he'd return and get it as cheap as he could. He went out and came in again, and said they would bate half a guinea and no more. We bid Roof pay it, and we would pay him again. He said he would. Presently I went out at the door, and saw a basket standing three or four doors off on the right hand. I thought this was our basket. I stepp'd out and look'd into the shop and found it to be a grocer's shop. I saw our porter standing in the shop all alone. I went back and told Watson, that I had seen the porter and basket at such a place. I lighted a pipe of tobacco and came to the door; then the basket was taken in. After that the porter came out with the basket on his back, and Roof close after him with a bag. Then I went in and told Watson that the goods were coming. We paid our reckoning and followed them. Roof carried the bag about two hundred yards; then I took it. We went to Harrison's house; we got there between 12 and 1 o'clock in the day; we sent the porter about his business. Harrison sent away for Newby; he came, and said he had company in his house, so could not stay; we had opened them before he came; he just looked upon them and went away. There was a mark upon the end of the printed linen, which Harrison got a pair of scissars, and cut off. We left them there for him to sell. There was a whole piece of cotton Roof would have for his own use; and he said he would pay us for it. About a day or two after, they said one Maculley wanted to buy some of it. Watson and I went down to his house, and took no notice we belong'd to the goods, to observe that they did not cheat us. There went a boy from Mr. Maculley's to Mr. Harrison's by his order, to fetch some of the linen that they might see it. He is a sea-faring man; his wife sells linen, ribbons, &amp;c. There were three pieces of printed linen brought down; they began to look at them, and said they were very pretty things. Harrison asked three shillings a yard, saying he had them to sell for a poor man who was in goal. The woman said she would have them, if her husband lik'd it; so she chose out two pieces; her husband was to give his note for them. Harrison said he would accept it. Said the woman, how many yards is there of them? Said Harrison, there is five or six and thirty yards of a piece. Said she, how much money do they come to? as they were casting it up, said the woman, had we not better measure them? Harrison said with all my heart; but there is the same quantity I'll assure you. Said the woman, I chuse to have them measured. Then Newby and Harrison measured them. There were but about twenty-five yards of a piece. Then they said, what villains are those that have got the man's goods when they had them in their custody, when the poor man was in goal. Then the woman agreed to give them the money, which was seven pounds ten shillings, at three shillings per yard. There was a note given from Mr. Maculley to Mr. Harrison, and Newby was a witness to it.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you get for these goods?</p>
               <p>Penprise. When Harrison first sold some of them, which was a day or two after he had them; he gave Watson and me twelve guineas in part; he said he had sold about fourteen pounds worth. But we never got any more for all the goods than that twelve guineas. We used to go to them to settle with them; but they would always put us off. Harrison would say Newby had got the money; and Newby would say Harrison had the money. So they serv'd us; we never could get them together, or get any other answer from them.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said he was taken up about some logwood, and sent to Mr. Harrison to be bail for him; that he came once to see him when he was in New Prison, but never came again, and would not bail him ; that Watson is run away; that he saw the goods in the boat as he was going over the boat to step on shore.</p>
               <p>Roof. I am a sugar-baker, I live at Colestairs, Shadwel. The 21st of last March Penprise knocked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120020"/> at my back door, I said who is there ? Said he a friend. I opened the door, in he threw a bale of goods; he bid me take care of them. I shut the door again, and went out at the fore door; then I saw Watson and Penprise. They desired I would open it, that they might see what was in it. There were four pieces of linen for sheeting, two pieces of printed cotton, four pieces of printed linen, what they call chints; there were two letters G B on the cover. I took that and threw it under my copper and burnt it; the next day I saw Watson. He told me I might send the goods any where, where I thought they would be safe. Then Bradley came to my house to buy some sugar; I shew'd him these goods; he said he would have the goods, and take care of them. I told him I was afraid my house would be rummag'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him how you came by them?</p>
               <p>Roof. I told him I believ'd they were stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does Bradley live?</p>
               <p>Roof. He lives at Hoxton, and keeps a chandler's shop. He said he would carry them to a place in Old-street where Kirkley liv'd. So he took some, and some a porter carried. When I had got rid of the things from my house, I went to Penprise, and he said there were some other goods which he would be glad to have me take. Then he gave into my custody eight pieces of black crape in a corn sack. Them I carried to my house, which Bradley fetch'd the day after to Old-street. As I was getting up about five or six days after, I saw some goods lying in my yard, I opened the door, in comes Penprise, and said there are some of the goods, and desired I would send them along with the other things. I never look'd into the bag, so don't know what they were; I put the bag into a basket, and laid five or six loaves of sugar upon them, and sent them after the others in about half an hour's time by my porter

               <p>Q. WHERE did you send them?</p>
               <p>Roof. I gave directions to him, that he was to carry them to Kirkley's house, and put them where Bradley put the other things. Watson came to me one day, and ask'd me to go and see if they were all sold. I called by myself at Kirkley's about five or six days after. Kirkley told me the porter had brought some goods which he had put up stairs with the other goods. About six weeks after, Watson ask'd me if I would go along with him to the place where the goods were. I said if he would come the next day I would. Penprise and he came accordingly. I employ'd

             the porter to go again. I bid him go to Kirkley's and we would meet him there. So we three set out; when we came almost to the house, I said there is the shop, and desired them to go into an ale-house. They went in. Then Kirkley told me he would send to Bradley, and they should have the goods when he came. He came before they had the goods; Bradley said when he came, the goods should not go till he had six guineas for the time of being there; upon that I stepp'd out to Penprise and Watson, and told them what he said. They said they would give him five guineas, and they desired me to lay down the money, and they would give me a note. Upon that I went to Bradley again, and told him what they were willing to give; he insisted upon five guineas and a half; so I paid five guineas down, and said he should have half a guinea more if the men agreed to it. Then Bradley took the key and went up two pair of stairs; he opened the chest and took out the goods, and put some of them into the porter's basket, and some into a bag; so I walk'd along with the porter to Penprise and Watson ; I ordered the porter to go ( according to the order agreed upon by them) to Harrison's in Ratcliff Highway. We all went thither, but I did not go into the house then.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the advertisement?</p>
               <p>Roof. No, I never did. Bradley told me about eight days after the goods were carried to his house they were advertised, and also he said, he knew the man who printed them.</p>
               <p>On his cross examination, he said Neal had been his porter about two years; that Neal did not know that they were Penprise's and Watson's goods; or that they were stolen ; that he could not tell how Bradley came to have a key to a room in Kirkley's house; and that there was no bargain made between Bradley and himself about the price for warehouse room.</p>

            . I am the porter. I carried some goods by Mr. Roof's order to Old-Street. It is a good while ago, I cannot recollect the time, I believe it was about last spring; I believe in March ; I was to carry them to Hoxton Square to Mr. Bradley's. I carried them there. Mr. Bradley ask'd me what it was. I said I could not tell. There was something in the bottom of the basket, I could not tell what. There was sugar on the top.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry any thing for Mr. Roof to Old-street to Mr. Kirkley's ?</p>
               <p>Neal. Yes, I have carried some lump sugar ; once I fetch'd some goods from Mr. Kirkley's. Mr. Roof said, Watson and Penprise wanted to speak with me. I went to them. They ask'd me to take a basket and go with them there. Roof said make your bargain as well as you can, I have nothing to do with that. I took my basket and went to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120023"/> Kirkley's by myself. I left my basket there, and went and drank a pint of beer; and after that I went and had the basket lifted upon me. (I saw Penprise, Watson, and Mr. Roof at another alehouse near Kirkley's ) My basket was pretty heavy; I carried it to Harrison's a broker in Ratcliff Highway. Penprise and Watson went there too. Penprise carried something in a handkerchief.</p>

            . I am the owner of these goods. There were in one bale, four pieces of Irish sheeting, one hundred and fifty yards; two pieces of printed cotton chints patterns, twenty eight yards each; four pieces of printed linen chints patterns, thirty five yards each. On this was my name in full length. They were bought of Mr. Craythorn in Cheapside, March 20. I always have my goods sent to Mr. Bradley's a stationer in Thames-street, who gives me house room; and as my man comes up from Greenwich where I live, he calls there to know what goods I have left there.</p>

             of Norwich.</p>
               <p>There were eight pieces of crape, four pieces of strip'd stuff, four pieces of canvas, No. 1. four Pieces of Camblet, No. 2. to be sent to Mr. Bradley stationer.</p>
               <p>One bill is 56 l. 4 s. the other bill makes the amount of the whole 108 l. 7 s.</p>
               <p>About 8 o'clock in the morning, March 21. Mrs. Best came home, and said she had met with a misfortune, having lost all these goods. Some time after this, there came a man to me, and said, he believed he could give me some account of my goods. I took out a search warrant and search'd Penprise's and Watson's houses; but it seems at Penprise's, I search'd the wrong cellar. Some time after this, a man came to me from Mr. Scott, the dry salter, to give me an account of my goods; saying he would carry me to a person, who had the goods brought to his house, which was this Roof. I went to Ratcliff-Cross to the Ship Tavern. We sent for Roof, but he could not be found. The next day I met with him there. He told me of his having the goods brought to his house; and went before Justice Bury, and swore to it. He told me the identical pieces of goods, so much as the number of yards. Then I had a warrant to search Harrison's house. I took Neal the porter who carried the goods there. Harrison happened to be at home. I fix'd two of my people at the door to see nothing was carried out. I went in with a constable and my servant. I desired the constable not to part from the warrant, yet notwithstanding, he gave it into Mr. Harrison's hand, which was using me very ill. In the very first drawer I opened, in a back room, up one pair of stairs, I found several pieces of printed cotton from one of my pieces. They were produced in Court. It is a new pattern just come out. I bought these goods myself. Then I said to Harrison, I have now the porter below, that can prove the delivery of the goods into your house. Said he, it is true, the goods were brought here, but they were here but one night; he then turn'd pale, and shook and trembled. He was carried before Justice Bury, and committed to New Prison. About six or seven days after this, on the 30th of July, a man came to me, and said, he believed he had seen some of my goods, which was the very person who gave me information at first, that was at Mrs. Maculley's. I went to Justice Bury for a warrant, then went down to this woman's house, and told her my business; sure, said she, they were not stolen. Said I, you bought them of Mr. Harrison. Said she, I did. Said I, they are my property. She said she would give me the bill, which her husband made a memorandum of. Said she, I have sold them to a person that is gone abroad. I think she said to Virginia: Said I, I have got a search warrant. Said she, don't affright me. The maid went up stairs and fetch'd me down a gown which she had made of one of the pieces; then Mrs. Maculley said she bought them of Newby and Harrison; that she had not money enough to pay for them, and her husband had given a note of hand for them, for 7 l. 19 s. They cost me 4 s. 2 d. per yard. I had these goods advertised in the Daily Advertiser, 20 l. reward, then for 40 l. But I heard nothing of them, till I found them as I have now mentioned. Here I heard of Bradley's being concerned. Then Kirkley and Bradley absconded. Here the prisoner Harrison acknowledg'd his guilt, and gave it up.</p>
               <p>Witness continues. Some time after this a man came to me, and told me he was sorry for Bradley, and pleaded innocency on his part. Then Bradley came down to Greenwich, to my house, some time in August, my coachman was five days in persuading him to come down; he began to tell me how innocent he was. Said I, your friend has told me you saw the advertisement, and after that you went to Roof and did not approve of taking the money proposed in the advertisement. I said, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120024"/> you had been an honest man, you would have made a discovery. He said, he could not tell what induced him not to do it.</p>
               <p>Upon Mrs. Maculley being call'd, rather than have her evidence opened in court, Bradley and Newby pleaded guilty.</p>

            . I was in Smithfield the day the prisoner was apprehended; the prisoner and Waters were together at a publick house there, the King's head, where I was ask'd to go in. I was told there was a very odd affair. By their discourse together I apprehended this horse was stolen. I told Mr. Waters, I thought it would be best for him to secure the man, and advertise the horse, then he might have an opportunity to bring a rogue to justice, and shew himself an honest man. After that a pretended, or real, servant of Mr. Waters's came in and whisper'd to him, and upon that they all three went out of the room together. Then I said, I believed they were all rogues, and I was afraid they were going to let the man run away. I said to my neighbour,

            , if he would assist me, I would detect him, and charge a constable with him. We went out of that room and found them all three together in another. I ask'd them, what they were going to do with the prisoner? saying, they must not let him go. Waters and his servant said, we have no business with him, and we will not detain him; that gave us more suspicion. We then were determined to detain him; accordingly I took hold of the prisoner, and said, I would charge a constable with him: Waters and his servant both interposed, and said we should not detain him, and laid hold of him to take him away; the servant threaten'd to knock me down, and swore desperately; I had much difficulty in saving myself from being push'd into the cellar. We at last got them all back into the room they were first in, then we sent for a constable and charg'd him with all three; the se rvant made an offer to go towards the door. I said to the constable, that fellow is going to run away, I desire you would take care of him; upon that the constable and I went after him, he was then got out at the door, and stood upon his defence, and said, the first man that came near him, he would beat his brains out. He ran away, and we after him, we cry'd out, stop thief, he was taken and brought back again. We insisted upon their going to the Counter that night; the constable took seven guineas of Waters for his appearing, the prisoner and the servant were carried to the Counter; and after they all apeared before my lord mayor, at Goldsmith's-hall; the prosecutor was there and swore to the gelding.</p>

               <p>Please to take it into consideration; is it likely I should steal a horse within four miles of my own house, (I live in Shoreditch) and come to sell him in Smithfield? I bought him of a man I am acquainted with, but I don't know where he lives. I gave three guineas for him: I had put myself out of money: I had set him up in Kingsland road,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120025"/> he had almost eat his head off, so I was forced to sell him for what I could get, little did I think the horse was stolen.</p>

            . The prisoner at the bar sent a man to me, on the 27th of July, to know if I would buy two horses. I said, I was going to the Princess's-Head in Rupert-street, if he would lead them there, I would talk with him. I had seen the prosecutor's horse the day before, the prisoner ask'd two guineas for him. I mistrusted he was stolen, as he was worth a great deal more. He brought the two geldings. I ask'd the price. He said, eight pound for the two. I said, friend, I believe you stole these horses, one of them is worth almost that money, and I must stop you and your boy too ( his son is about thirteen years of age) the boy fell a crying, and desired I would not send him to jail. I ask'd the prisoner where he got the horses, he would not tell me. He said, if I would let the child go, he would tell me. So I did, then he would not say any thing about it. I carried him to Bridewell, and took the horses in my possession. I took him to justice Fielding's, there he said, when he came to his trial he would tell how he came by them. I advertised the horses, and gave papers out to the news carriers. About a fortnight or three weeks after the prosecutor came to me; he told me the market of his gelding before he saw him. Then the prosecutor and I took the prisoner before the justice. The clark ask'd him how he came by this horse. He said, he stole him. The justice desired I would keep the horse till sessions I desired the prosecutor might have him away, so the horse was delivered.</p>

Some time after that he came to me, and told me, he had taken up some people upon suspicion, one was named Sherlock. The captain bought it for us in the West-Indies, he is our factor.

They said, they would come back in an hour or two. They went out, and was gone about two hours. They brought two pieces of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120026"/> lignum vitae wood, one piece they put into the house, but the piece Mackpay had, fell out of his hands into the water. I saw them take it up at low water. They said, there were more upon the road, and went out again with Swinney with them ; they brought another piece. Sherlock said it was a brave piece, it would fetch three halfpence a pound. About four o'clock in the morning they took a wherry, and put their three pieces into the boat, the three pieces might weigh about 200 weight, I saw them row it over the water. Sherlock was taken up, the other two made off. I was along with Sherlock before the justice on the 7th of

            . I live with my brother, he is a merchant and deals in all sorts of wood; he lives at Wapping-dock. The prisoner offered me three pieces of lignum vitae wood the 5th or 6th of August, a little before 6 o'clock, he and another man brought them; I believe they might weigh two hundred and a quarter; they ask'd five shillings a hundred for it, and I believe it was worth about twelve shillings a hundred. We thought he did not come honestly by it. Sherlock said it was fire wood, and they had four pieces more. I stood pretty near the door, and we wanted to secure them, but when they saw our design, they ran away; we stopped the wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Cherry-garden-stairs?</p>
               <p>Cripps. It is a pretty way off from over against Wapping dock, they must have come down the river above a quarter of a mile.</p>

               <p>I met an old ship-mate on the road, he desired me to carry that wood for him, I did accordingly. I threw it down at the water side. Then he said, Sherlock, I hope you will be so good as to come over the water with us. I said, I would with all my heart, not thinking but he belonged to it.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor had occasion to dismount, to do a chare for himself, he left his horse at a gate and went into a field. When he returned, his hat, which he had left hanging upon the gate, was gone. He fear'd there might be some persons near at hand, that would make an attempt upon him, turn'd his horse up, knowing he would go home; and he walk'd a nearer way cross the field (this was August the 22d. about nine o'clock at night). He never saw his horse again till September the 10th.

In our return in Long Lane, (the prisoner lived in Chick Lane) he said here is a stocking shop, I believe we can break it open. We went to it. The moment

             took out a crow that we had for that purpose, and put it into the place where the shutter slides, and we wrench'd a piece of it off; then we press'd up the shutter and got the bottom part out. Then we consulted who should go in. I said I did not care, I would. The three others all held up the bottom of the shutter, and pulled it out so far that I could creep in underneath it; the bolt held it so that we could not take it down. After I was in, I went to the door; the key was in, but I could not unlock it. I handed out six bundles of stockings done up in papers; then I thought I heard the foot of a man I said d - n it let me out, for here is a man in the shop. I heard two dogs when I was out. We got into the sheep-pens ; and when the dogs had done barking, and no body call'd watch or thieves, which we expected they would, had any body heard us, to have put us to flight; we concluded to go again, thinking all safe. We staid till the watchmen were gone; for there came three of them within a little of that shop. Then we carried the things to the prisoner's lodgings, and the watch being settled we went again. I was dubious of going in again ; and the prisoner, being somewhat smaller and in a sailor's jacket, he enter'd the shop as I had done before, we all holding the shutter for him. When he was in, he tried to open the door but could not unlock it. Then he pull'd the key out of the bolt that was to the window; and we took down the shutter next to the door. Then I held the bag which we brought from the prisoner's lodgings, and the prisoner handed more stockings to me; and

We put the shutter up again in its place, and took the bag and the two rolls under our arms, and carried them, and put them where we did the others. Then we staid till the watch came two. When they were settled again, we all went back, and filled the bag again, and took two more rolls of flannel, and we carried them to the same place. Then we concluded to come once more, by that time the watch was gone three. After we had got as many things as we could, we ran away and put them up to the other. We put the shutter up betwixt each time; but whether it was up the last time I cannot say. The people coming from Long Lane, hinder'd us from quite filling the bag the last time. I am not positive whether there were forty three, or forty five parcels of stockings. There were upwards of thirty dozen. We divided for our own wear two pair each. We did not measure the flannel.

            . I live in Blackmore-street, in Southwark. The prisoner brought the harness into my house about 5 o'clock in the morning of the 28th, and wanted to sell them. I mistrusted they were stolen. I went out at my back door, and call'd one Williams to aid and assist me. The prisoner damn'd his eyes and limbs, and said, he wou'd do for us. I sent for the coachmaker who lives near me to hear his opinion about it. He happen'd to be the man that made them for Mr. Chapman; so he sent him word, and he came and owned them.</p>

            . I live at the Swan and Crown in Blackmore-street. The prisoner had a little before been at my house with a great coat on his back, and hardly any shoes to his feet ; he ask'd if any body would buy the coat, saying, he was going to Portsmouth, and he could better travel without a coat, than without shoes; that he would buy a pair of shoes with the money. He ask'd 15 s. then he came to 12 s. After questioning him, I agreed with him for 7 s. 6 s. About an hour and a half after, I saw him carried by to go before the justice. Then I took the coat on my arm and followed after. There was the prosecutor, who owned it.</p>

I live in lower Shadwell. My wife had taken the prisoner into her house, as he was in great distress, a poor ragged boy, and said he had not lain under a roo for above three months together before. So when I came home, I gave him my seafaring cloaths and cotton shirts, and I paid all the debts my wife had contracted in my absence. She said to me one day of a neighbour, here is a man, who has been a friend to me in your absence. Said I, if he has given you water, give him wine. I sent my wife home for half a guinea out of my chest. She went and brought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120029"/> it me; and when we went home, my chest was broke open, my money in the indictment gone, and the prisoner took. I heard of him in about three weeks after. He had spent all my money but 4 l. 7 s. which he return'd me before Esq Clark, and gave me the purse it was in when he took it. It was produc'd in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Jane Macdaniel. I am to the prosecutor. When my husband sent me home for the half guinea, the prisoner was in the house, I could not unlock the chest, I desired he would unlock it, which he did; he went down stairs again, before I had opened the chest. I took out a half guinea, and left the other gold, mentioned before, in the purse, and locked the chest again. Then I went to my husband, and when we came home again, the chest was broke open, and the prisoner and money all gone. He was taken up in the Borough, and owned the fact, and said, there were honester men than himself hang'd; but if he was to be hang'd, it was fit he should have all the money.</p>

I was within three or four yards of the deceased. I saw the prisoner when he was coming. About ten yards before he came to the deceased, he went past him three or four yards; then he turn'd again, and cut the deceas'd over the head with the hanger. I was just opposite to him at this time. The deceased had nothing in his hand, nor did I see him do any thing to the prisoner before he struck him. The deceas'd after that ran towards him to close in upon him. Then the prisoner push'd him into the belly, on the left side the navel, with the hanger. I did not hear a word pass on either side. A person lifted up his cloaths, I saw the wound in his belly about an inch long. The prisoner seem'd not sensible of it, till the people said, surely he is wounded in the belly. The deceased then lifted up his hands and said, I shall lose my life by that villain.</p>

            . I was just by the deceased. It was within about fifty yards of the place of turning round. I saw the prisoner come flourishing his sword about ten yards before he came to us. The walking man might be about two or three yards behind him. The prisoner gave the deceas'd a push in the breast; I might have had it as well as he. We both stood alike to see the man walk. The deceas'd could not get back for the number of people that were behind him. The people push'd him forward again. The prisoner might have been got about two or three steps; he turn'd round and cut him as hard as he could strike with the hanger on his head. I did not observe any words on either side. The deceas'd had nothing in his hand. I saw him, after he was cut, make an offer with his fist at the prisoner. Then the crowd push'd in, that I could not see him for a little time. After that, I saw him holding his hand to his belly, and the blood running down his face. I heard he was wounded in his belly, but I saw no other wound but that on his head.</p>

            . I was within two yards of the deceas'd at this time, on the same side of the way he was on. There was a lane made five, six, or ten deep for the man to walk in. I saw the prisoner pass by the deceas'd, and turn back and strike him with the hanger on his head. The blood follow'd the blow directly. The deceas'd did not do any thing to the prisoner to occasion this. Then the deceas'd got up and collar'd the prisoner. The prisoner got loose by some means, and as soon as he was so, he gave the deceas'd a thrust on the left side of the belly near the navel. The people were so close to the deceas'd, that he could not get backwards. The prisoner immediately pushed on before the walking man. I did not perceive the deceas'd stand any farther out than the other people. When the deceased's shirt was put up, I saw a single gut hang out of the wound, but I saw no blood there.</p>

There was the prisoner walked on one side, another on the other side, and a Black siddling in the middle, going to clear the way before the walking man. The deceas'd stoop'd down to see if the man was coming. He stood as back as he could.

I found he had a wound on the left side the belly, near the navel, where the intestine came out; he languish'd till Monday morning, and then died. It was about an inch long. The gut was not cut, but there was a large quantity of it out; and all that was out mortified. That was the occasion of his death. There was a wound on his head, but that was not dangerous.</p>

Accordingly we four got a boat and went to Summer's Key. Then Davie was on shore at Billingsgate in Darkhouse Lane near the wharf We gave him the usual notice with the call of Yolow. Then we all went and looked from the Key, and saw a watchman sitting in the lighter. Upon this we walk'd about an hour or two, and after that we got into our boat, and came along side the lighter. The man was awake and we could not meddle with any. Then we lay in our boat an hour or two longer; and between five and six in the morning we agreed that Davie should go on shore for a draught of purl, and call the watchman to drink Davie did so. Then we went to work, and got nine of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Penprise. It was a cloudy morning. But the watchman call'd out, what boat is that along side the lighter? We cry'd, damn him, what was that to him, and went away. We neither of us went out of our boat, we could reach them from the lighter as we stood. We row'd away to Hanoverhole, and landed them there at Roof's house. We left them and went to Roof's other house, in Shadwell, and told him we had landed such goods. Davie was not with us then. Roof told us, he would go over in the day, and look at them. We ask'd him 2 s. 6 d. a pound. He said, he could not give it. He agreed with us for 1 s. 6 d. Davie was not present at this agreement, there were only Watson and I; we went afterwards to see them weigh'd, there was about 400 pounds weight, the money came to 29 l. Faulkner and I received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175009120031"/> 20 l. We shar'd this amongst us, five persons. We went and drank either at my house or at the Fox in Fox lane, Shadwell. We had all an equal share. Parker and Davie went and received the rest of the money the next day. Roof told us, he had paid it them; Davie had got it, and did design to keep it all. We laid him down and hussled him, and took it away from him.</p>
               <p>Q. from Parker. How much of the nine pounds did you give me ?</p>
               <p>Penprise. I don't believe you had any. You had share of the other, for when we hussled the money out of his pocket, some got some, and some none ; but Parker was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you put Parker into the first information?</p>
               <p>Penprise. He is in the information. I never made but one, and that was before justice Hammond.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you put him into the information?</p>
               <p>Penprise. Because he has been guilty with me in several robberies besides this.</p>
               <p>Parker. The reason, my lord, why he put me into the information, was, because I would not be concerned with him in shooting Roof.</p>

            . My husband used to go out with these young men. On the 26th of May, my husband happened to be a little fuddled. We lived in Bell-yard, Chick lane. He would not go out with them. Between three and four the next morning they knock'd at the door, and my husband let them in; then George Taylor said, you dog, you would not go with us. I saw him take the linen out of a pillow bear, this apron was left in my drawers. Holding a baker's white apron in her hand, which the prosecutor deposed to. My husband said, let me be never so wicked myself, you shall not come into any trouble; and bid me go and pawn it, which I did, for six pence. On the Monday morning they carried the goods, which were shirts and shifts, and a child's frock all iron'd up well, to Duke's place and sold them.</p>

               <p>E. Cross. They said they had been into Coldbath-fields, and had broke open a baker's shop, they all three said so. I gave this information to a man who fetched the apron out of pawn by my directions. I was willing to clear myself, as my husband is transported, so I desired that person to tell the prosecutor</p>

I found the chairs displaced, which stood against the wall, and a hole broke in the wall close by the door in the kitchen; the drawers were open, and I found three or four shirts gone; five shifts, two frocks, and one white apron, which we had been ironing on the Friday night, were also gone.</p>

I saw the box the day before in its place. I lost also two rolls of flannel. About three or four days after I had an information by a woman now in court. I got a search warrant and searched Cavenhau's house, in Drury lane, there I found the rockeloe. I found my flannel, and some thread, and I found the breeches, but they were not in the house, they were found on a person's back. There were a brown gown found in the house upon a maid's back, Cavenhau said, they were brought in by a lodger.</p>

I keep the books, and have an account of what was in it (She mentions them as in the Indictment). The box was lock'd, Mr. Woolfall kept the key. She was shewn the bundles of thread found.

I took an inventory of them all. There were this last witness, the prosecutor, and another young woman before the justice. This witness then said, she could swear to the things. Then we went to St. Andrew's street, to the three Coffins near the seven Dials, to Masterson's lodgings, we laid hold of him, and in searching him we found a pistol in his bosom. He lodged up one pair of stairs; we went and opened a box, and found in it some more flannel, and four pound of thread. The young woman came up, and said, I'll swear that is my box. She took a key she had got and opened it directly.</p>

I saw two rolls of thread, which lay upon the table between the two windows. I saw also three spoons, and a long black hood, Mrs Cavenhau said, she had them to sell. She employed Mrs. Cook to sell them for her. She carried them out and brought Mrs. Cavenhau 50 s. Mrs. Cavenhau said that was better than nothing. I saw some gowns, none of these things were in the house before they went out. Masterson, the prisoner, gave my son a pair of breeches. Mrs. Cavenhau asked him. If he had an old pair, he order'd my son to come on Sunday morning. Mr. Woolfall swore to the breeches, and put my boy in Bridwell.</p>

             to land forty one bundles of hempen sacks at Bear Key, four thousand and odd in number. It being too late to land them, we concluded to let them abide in the vessel all night. I saw them in it as I stood on the shore at the Key about seven o'clock in the evening. In each bundle the top sack was mark'd with a V upon it. Each sack was worth five pence half penny. The next day, according to our computation, there were two hundred wanting, two bundles being gone; they were the property of Mr. Amyand.</p>

On Sunday the first of July I got up about 6 o'clock, and opened my backdoor. I heard a groaning . I had occasion to go into my own necessary house. The time I was there, I heard this groaning continually. Then I went near. I heard a person speaking to the prisoner who was in her necessary house. The prisoner said, I have been prodigious bad all night with the cholic and pain in my bowels. I don't take upon me to swear to the voice ; but I think it was the prisoner. I thought no more of it till a child was found on the Wednesday morning in this necessary house. Then there came

            , to my house, and desired I'd let them go into my back yard, to see if there was a child in that vault. I had flung a great heap of dirt to keep the filth from coming through. They dug that away. Then they saw a child, I did not go with them; they came and told me what they saw, and desired I'd lend them something to get it out. I lent them a garden how, with which they took it out, and brought it to my house. There was a bruise on one side of the head. It was a female child. It was reported about the town, the prisoner was with child before this.</p>

            . I live under the same roof the prisoner does, I was going to the pump this Sunday morning. I saw the prisoner sitting in the necessary house. She groaned, and said, it was a sad thing to have her bowels so bad. I said, so it is. She got off and went in a-doors. I went out about my business. When I came back again about 8 o'clock, I found the house very still. Some time after her mother came home. I asked her how her daughter did. She said, she was indifferent. After that, I observed the necessary house clean washed. On the Wednesday morning I got a candle and looked down the necessary house, and there I saw a young child lie, then I made it known</p>

            . I am a Surgeon, and live at this same town. Hearing a female child was found in a bog house, on Friday the 6th of July, I went to see the child. I did not observe any marks of violence on it. It was a fine full grown child. I opened the chest of it, and took out the right lobe of the lungs, and put it into Water. That induced me to believe the child was born alive ; for that swam. Had the child never breathed, the lungs would have sunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible a woman might be deliver'd of such a child as this, by a sudden surprize, while she is sitting on the necessary house?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It is very improbable.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it possible?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I think it is next to impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a man-midwife ?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, my lord, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard of things of this kind coming by surprize?</p>
               <p>Stevens. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a woman should be taken with violent pains, while sitting in that manner? whether or no a child may not come from her immediately?</p>
               <p>Stevens. It is very improbable.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not such sort of disorder occassion the person sometimes to want to go to stool?</p>
               <p>Stevens. I never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never hear of a woman going cross a room, and, upon some sudden surprize, bring forth a child directly?</p>

I went to bed on Saturday night betwixt nine and ten o'clock, about six the next morning I got up; the window was broken, and the things mentioned in the indictment were gone, which before were lying in the window. I had not fastened the shutter overnight.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a front window?</p>
               <p>E. Cox. It was in a publick back yard. She took the opportunity to change her shift, and left an old dirty rag of a shift in the yard. She had liv'd in the yard some time before. She was but that night come from out of trouble. The old shift was known to be the prisoner's, by a little girl who used to lye with her. A neighbour informed me, about ten o'clock at night, she saw the prisoner sitting at the corner of Queen's-square, at a gentleman's door. I went and ask'd her to let me see what sort of a shift she had on, and took her by the arm, and carried her into a neighbour's house, and I described the shift to my neighbour before I searched the prisoner. I found it to be my shift. She was carried to the Round-house, there she pull'd mine off and put her rag on again. It was produced in court, and she swore to it.</p>

               <p>I bought that shift in King-street, Westminster. There was cloth enough to make two; the other I have now on my back. The two cost six shillings, and she took that shift from my back.</p>

I missed the tea kettle, but had no mistrust of the prisoner, till I had an information by some of my neighbours. I sent for her to my house, and charged her with it. She at first denied it. Then I sent for the constable to take her into custody, when she owned it, saying, she had pawned it at Mr. Harris's, by St. Giles's church, and hop'd I would forgive her. We took her along with us to the pawnbroker, and there found it as she had said.</p>
