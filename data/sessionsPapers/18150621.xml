I tried to stop him; he struck at me, but did not hit me, because I stumbled back against a door-way. He passed me, and ran up Plough-court, into Carey-street; upon which, I pursued him, crying stop thief; he turned to the right, towards Chancery-lane. Two gentlemen were coming along with a lady, and he ran across the way, and put his back against the wall. I went up, and took him, and he asked for mercy, and that is all I know.</p>

I told her for what; she gave me the tickets out of her pocket. I was going to search her, when she said, if Mrs. Blow would forgive her, she would get the things back. Afterwards I was going to search her, when she gave me the tickets.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were are the tickets - A. Here they are.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The humble petition of Elizabeth Green, sheweth, that she is an unfortunate woman, and rented a room of the prosecutrix, for the weekly sum of four shillings and sixpence; that your petitioner always most punctually paid her rent, until this time, when she was driven by distress to commit the act which has brought her before this bar. She fully intended, and told the prosecutrix that she would, leave every thing as she found it. I was about to go and get these things out, when the officer took me into custody, and I surrendered up the tickets freely, and without hesitation. By receiving the mercy of the honourable judge and jury, your petitioner will for ever feel bound to pray.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, go on, relate what occured - A. My mistress told me to make secure the door; which I did, about half past nine in the evening of the 12th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at the window then - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you go to bed - A. At about eleven o'clock, sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any alarm in the night - A. I did, at about one o'clock; I heard a noise, which induced me to look out of the window; I could see nothing, but I heard my master's voice, telling me to open the front door, which was close to the mill; I went down stairs; I then saw my master, and his man, Miles, struggling with Bailey, the prisoner at the bar; it was near the front door of the house, which was close to the mill.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do with Bailey - A. They had him down against the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, what then - A. They took him into the house. He called out very plain for help when he was out of doors. I went to call Brown, the carter, but they had got him in then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the same room when Brown came - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. What then passed - A. My master asked him how he intended to carry away the flour, and he said, upon my back.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said about the window - A. Not to my knowledge. My master asked him, what was become of the candle, and he said, he might make himself happy where the candle was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the mill, and perceive how the flour was - A. In the morning I went into the mill, and saw some strange bags; I mean they were not my master's; some were full, and some were empty.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the bags in the mill the night before - A. I had not.</p>

            ; I live at No. 11, Sackville-street, Bethnal Green. I was returning home from Edmonton, on the evening of the 23rd of May; Mrs. Chaplain was with me; at about a quarter before ten, we were in Kingsland-road. The reason I was so late was that I was in expectation of a friend accompaning us home. I had a bundle in my hand, which contained two pair of shoes, two handkerchiefs, and some other little things; the shoes belonged to me, and the rest of the things to Mrs. Chaplin. Nothing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210005"/>happened to us until we came opposite to the Duchess of York public-house, at the same side of the way, a man came up to the side of me from the fields, by the side of the public-house, and laid hold of my bundle; he did not say a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he snatch it - A. No; he took hold of it, and tried to take it away; I resisted. He threw me down; by which means, he got the bundle, and ran away with it across the fields. I screamed out, murder, and two men came out of the Duchess of York, who followed him across the fields. I know the man; he was the prisoner at the bar; I looked at him while we were struggling for the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you frightened - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice the man sufficiently to know that it was the prisoner at the bar? don't speak if you have any doubt - A. I am sure he is the man; he had on a light great coat, with white trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a hat on - A. He had a hat when he first came up to me; which he lost in the scuffle, and it was picked up by Mrs. Chaplin. When he ran away, he went without his hat. The next time I saw him was on the Sunday following, at Worship-street office; I could swear to him at that time. I had been to Edmonton, to see my mother; it was close to the door of the Duchess of York public-house that I was robbed; there were no persons near.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I was very much terrified; I resisted much; I was very much alarmed; but from the view I had of the person who robbed me, I am certain it was the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Thomas-street. On the evening of the 23rd, I and Mrs. Palmer were returning from Edmonton; I was going before her; a man came up to Mrs. Palmer; he did not speak; I heard the cry of murder, and turned round, when I saw Mrs. Palmer and the man struggling together; I could not assist her in the least, because I had a young child in my arms. The man was pulling the bundle out of her hand; she resisted very much, and he threw her down, and got the bundle. By her screaming murder, two young men came out of the Duchess of York. When he got the bundle, he ran across the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it before the two young men came out of the public-house, that the man who robbed Mrs. Palmer, ran across the fields - A. He was in the fields when they came out. One of the young men is here, his name is Sullivan. I did not see the man's hat fall, but I picked it up after he ran away. I should not know the hat if I saw it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the man so as to know him again if you should see him - A. No, I did not, I only knew his dress; he had on a light great coat, and a pair of white trowsers.</p>

I am a dustman, I saw the prisoner at the Prince of Wale's public-house, in Oliver-lane, on Thursday night; I do not know what Thursday; it was after Easter, but I don't remember whether it was before Whit Monday. The prisoner was taken into custody on the Saturday after the Thursday on which I saw him. I asked the prisoner to drink with me. We had known each other. He said, I am in work now Jack, and said, he should be a pint with me. He also said he wanted to buy a hat; I said, I will sell you mine Henry; he said, what will you take for it I said five shillings, he said, he would give it me. I asked him what he had done with his own, and he said, he had cut the rim off, when he was at work in the brick-fields. He asked me if Mr. Armstrong the officer had enquired for him, at Mr. Clarke's in Oliver-lane, because he believed there was some information, against him; I told him, I did not see Mr. Armstrong there; he said, he would take the hat of me and was to have met me on the Saturday following to give me the money, when I heard that he was taken up.</p>

On the 8th of May, I was coming through St. Giles's from my work, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening, and observing a crowd opposite the church, I stopped and enquired what was the matter. A person told me it was a woman, who was stopped on suspicion of stealing something. I remarked that if she was innocent, it was a great shame, and the prisoner answered me, and said, it was, and offered to assist me in rescuing her. After some slight interruption to the woman, she was suffered to go about her business, and I went about mine. I had not proceeded sixty yards, before the prisoner overtook me, and told me that the woman was again<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210006"/>stopped, and asked me would I not return, and see she was not hurt.

On the 15th of May, I was at the house of a person named Cleveland, between the hours of eleven and twelve in the forenoon; there was a soldier of the same regiment, who had some claim upon his agent, and came up to me, and asked me to make it out for him, as he could not write himself. Knowing that it was a just claim, I went to make it out. I put my cap beside me with my pocket-book containing the notes, and a handkerchief in it. While I was writing, the prisoner sit on my left, where the cap was; I knew him before. I was going to return to my friends in Ireland by the coach that night, and the prisoner engaged to carry my trunk for me to the coach office. He said to me while I was writing, Serjeant, I am just going out, I will return in two minutes. I replied very well, and told him to make haste. I shortly afterwards missed my pocket-book, and the handkerchief in which my arm had been slung. The prisoner did not come back, so I immediately went to the Royal College, and asked the Serjeant of his ward, if he was in, he was a Chelsea pensioner. The serjeant told me he was not. In returning, I overtook him. I took him into custody immediately, I and an officer accompanied him to Sloane-square. I there insisted on his being searched, and on him were found some three shilling bank-tokens, a five and sixpenny piece, a shilling, and eleven pence in halfpence, together with the handkerchief, in which my arm was slung, and which he took out of my cap. I found neither pocket-book nor notes; he said, that he had changed one, and that the pocket-book and the remainder were stolen from him by a woman.</p>

There are four persons sleep on the same floor. I immediately put on my great coat, and went out at the private door, to see what had been done outside; I there discovered that the bar had been forced up, and the shutters forced down, and this linen taken away. The watchman came immediately, and assisted me in putting up the shutters again. In consequence of some information that I received, that a man was taken to Marlborough-street on suspicion of having stolen some linen, which was found on him; I went there, and identified the property to be mine.</p>

The coach-house and stable are together; and some of the servants sleep over the stable. The coach-house door was broken open on the night of the 21st of May, by a false key; a hammer-cloth, a box coat, and four coach glasses, were stolen that evening. I saw them safe when I locked up the stable at seven o'clock, and the next morning at nine, they were gone. I went into the stable directly after seven, and did not quit them until we went to bed. I slept over the stables. It was impossible for any one to get into the coach-house and get these things while I was awake, without our hearing; for we were so near; we went to bed about half after ten. I missed them at nine the next morning. I saw part of them the same morning, at Marlborough-street office, they were in the possession of the St. Giles's watchhouse-keeper, I can swear to them as the property of my master.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 21st of May, I was in Browlow-street, Long Acre, between one and two in the morning, I was standing talking to the patrole and another watchman, and I heard a foot coming along on the other side of the way; I crossed, leaving the patrole and watchman, and saw a man coming along with a box coat, and the prisoner was behind him. I knew the prisoner before; I saw some glass under his coat, by the light from my lanthorn. I went to lay hold of him; the other man ran off, and so did he. I cried stop thief, and sprung my rattle. He let drop the glass immediately. I never lost sight of him until he was stopped by my pal, the watchman; seeing him secured, I pursued the man with the box coat, which he dropped, together with the hammer-cloth, and escaped.</p>

            . I was standing talking to a friend in Watling-street, on the 9th of June, about thirty yards from the corner of Friday-street; I saw the prisoner, and two other suspicious looking characters on the other side of the way. I observed to my friend, that they were after no good, and I would watch them. I had scarcely made the observation, before one of them went in front of the last witness, who was walking along, and just as he came between the post and the corner, stopped short, and the other two closed up. I then saw the prisoner at the bar, thrust his hand into his pocket, and pull out the pocket-book. I immediately sprang forward, and collared him; upon which, the other two men made their escape, and the prisoner threw the pocket-book under a cart. He was taken into custody by an officer, and immediately taken before the magistrate at Guildhall.</p>

               <p>COLONEL MILMAN. On the 13th of May, between three and four in the afternoon, I was in <placeName id="t18150621-19-crimeloc105">Bond-street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18150621-19-crimeloc105" type="placeName" value="Bond-street"/>

On a sudden, I missed my snuff-box, being alarmed by a jerk of my coat; I turned round, and saw the prisoner behind me; I let him go on, and I followed him, until he got to St. James's church, in Piccadilly; I there tapped him on the shoulder, and requested he would have the goodness to oblige me with a pinch of snuff; he told me, he had none. I replied, you must have some, for you know you have just picked up my box, in Bond-street; he then said, is it your box? I told him it was; and he asked me to describe it; I did, and he then gave it me. I called an officer, and immediately gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming along, and saw the snuff-box on the ground, just behind this gentleman; I picked it up, and put it in my pocket. He came after me, and said, it was his, but I did not choose to give it him, until he had described it; when he had, I immediately saw he had a right to it, and of course surrendered it up to him.</p>

            . I am shopman to Messrs. Simmons and Jones, I was in the shop on the 20th, and saw the prisoners come in, I served them, they wanted to look at some lace shawls, I cannot say which spoke. I shewed some immediately to them. After turning over a considerable quantity, at last there appeared to be one which they liked, and they asked the price of it. The price was three pounds ten shillings; she did not approve of the price. I mean Thompson did not. They were going out, I stood chattering to them at the door, and at length I got them in again, I then lowered the price to two pounds fifteen shillings, and she bid me two pounds ten shillings, and which I agreed to take. I put it into a paper, and Joscelyn took out three one-pound notes and gave them to me. I went into the adjoining shop to get change, and when I returned into this shop again, I perceived Joscelyn with her right hand upon a shawl, which she was going to steal. I kept my eye upon her. She requested me to reach her a shawl, which she pointed out to try whether the one she had bought, was as long as it, she measured and was satisfied. While I was reaching, she pulled some shawls with her left hand, over her right hand, to avoid being seen, and she then took a shawl with her right hand, and put it into her pocket. She then expressed herself satisfied with the shawl she had bought. I wrapped it up in paper. She said, good afternoon, I have stolen that piece. I directly jumped over the counter, took hold of her by the arm, and I was putting her up four pair of stairs, into a passage to take her into a room to search her, she threw the shawl from her into the passage. I saw it fall from her about a yard. I called to Mr. Simmons, who came to my assistance. I did not see Thompson do any thing. She did not try to run away, if she choosed she might have escaped.</p>

               <p>MR. SIMMONS. I was called into the shop by Pike, and saw the shawls on the ground. I sent for a constable, Burn was his name.</p>

               <p>MRS. HERBRETCHER. I am wife to the last witness. The prisoner lived with me, we expected her to stay longer with us; but she left. There was no quarrel. She went away on the Saturday to see her friends, and we expected her to return on the Monday, but she never came; and that raised our suspicion. In consequence we searched, and found missing, a silk gown, value four pounds, a cotton gown, value ten shillings, two pair of stockings, value four shillings, three neckcloths, value two shillings, a dimity pocket, value one shilling, and one cotton apron, value one shilling and sixpence. I saw part of these things, on the Sunday before the prisoner came. The next time I saw the prisoner was accidently, last Sunday in Brick-lane. When we went to her lodgings, we did not find her, when we met her, we charged her with stealing the property, she told us, it was deposited at two pawnbrokers; and gave us their names, and places of abode. She told us the duplicates were destroyed. We found the silk gown, the dimity pocket, and one or two other things.</p>

We missed a counterpane, one shirt, one sheet, two table-cloths, one silk shawl, one child's jacket, one neckcloth, one black frock, a child's pincloth, a coat, a quantity of cheese and butter, and a quantity of lamb, for which I paid twelve shillings and sixpence. I am sure all these things were in the house, for the prisoner had been washing the principal part of them on the Saturday, and called me down to see what a good colour she had made them of.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner, and conveyed her to the Poultry Compter. I searched her there. I told her that it would be better for her to confess. I was searching her, when she said, I know what you are searching for.</p>

               <p>Q. To Mrs. Ireton. Could the prisoner have carried off all these things at once - A. No; she could not.</p>

               <p>(The humble petition of Elizabeth Hetherell.)</p>
               <p>Sheweth that your prisoner, was tried at this place last April three years. She was found guilty, and was sentenced to be transported to New South Wales. She was proceeding on her voyage thither, when She was taken by the French, and your petitioner and the rest of the convicts, were landed on the Island of St. Antonio. We were taken up by another British vessel, and were brought to Portsmouth. In consequence of my good behaviour on that voyage homeward, the captain and his lady, were interested in my behalf, and got me my free pardon. When I returned to London, I went to the Reffuge, and there I remained until I got the situation, in the family of the prosecutrix. The prosecutrix is a great drunkard herself, and used to make me drink gin, and other spirits. Her husband is a very sober man, and used to tell me not to encourage her in that practice. On the day stated in the indictment, I was intoxicated with the liquor which my mistress had given me, and I went out, leaving the door open. When I came to myself, I was afraid the house would have been robbed, and therefore I did not return. In consideration of my good character and behaviour, which induced the captain and his lady, to procure me a free pardon. I hope the honourable judge and the jury, will be induced to pity the case of an unfortunate culprit, for which your prisoner will for ever be in duty bound to pray.</p>

            . I am a watchman. The prisoner at the bar passed me, about four o'clock in the morning, of the 4th, at the end of Oxford-street, and was making his way down Crown-street, when I stopped him; he had a bag on his shoulder, and I asked him what he had got there; he said, watercresses. I said, I was very fond of water-cresses, and I wished he would give me a few for my breakfast; he made no reply, but threw down the bag, and ran off. I sprung my rattle. I put my hand into the bag, and found the water-cresses quite warm; for they were ducks and fowls; I found there were fifteen fowls, one with its bead off, and five ducks. The prisoner was stopped by the next watchman. I delivered the fowls and ducks in at the watchhouse, and that is all I know about it.</p>

               <p>KENNEDY. I am an officer of Worship-street office; I apprehended the prisoner between one and two in the afternoon, of the 16th of June, by the desire of his master; his master came to me, to fetch me to apprehend him. The man was in a house in the City; and I am a Middlesex officer; and I did not chose to act in the City; he did not live in the house; we met him coming out; he said, there was no property in the house. The master insisted upon my searching; I did, but found nothing belonging to him. The prisoner then took me to Bunhill row, St. Luke's in company with his master, and at the door of a public-house, called the Brew-House the cask was standing; he pointed the cask out to me; he told me it was his master's property. I have had it in my possession ever since. Have it.</p>

I asked him if his master was there, he replied he was not; in it he had the retting of him. Then I asked what lie who tell for him, he asked eighteen guineas and I gave him seventeen pounds five shillings, he was an aged horse; I bid him a sixteen guineas, but bint down to seventeen pounds five shillings. We then went into the Rose-inn he gave me his master's name and place of abode. He gave me a memorandum, not a receipt, we never do take receipts in that way. The uniform was Mr. Viven Sloane-street, Chelsea, I did not asked him for receipts. I then took the horse home. I do a great steal of business, and I don't always take and give receipts, for this kind of business.

            . I am beadle of the parish. I went to the lodgings of Taylor, on Sunday morning, or Saturday night. I went then. I went up stairs, and he was in bed, I asked him if he had two gowns, he said, he had no gowns, I said you must have them, because Blower immediately lifted up the gowns, saying he supposed that I told him to get up and dress coat along with me, which he did really. I taken Blower before. The woman, B appear, was suspected of having stolen them, Blower told me to go to Taylor, for had the gowns, and that would clear the gift. Here is the gown.</p>
               <p>Priscrilla Sharp. That is my gown.</p>

             with me, she said she was going to see her brother; she wanted to stop all night at my quarters, but the people of the house would not suffer her. She was up stairs in the house. The woman went away when these gowns were missed. I was suspected, and I told them I was very willing that they should search every thing I had. This girl was frightened and told me she had given the things to Taylor.</p>
               <p>Taylor's Defence. What my commonside says is very true. This girl came on to London with us, I carried her bundle for her. On this night, she came and gave me two gowns, which she told me were her's and asked, me to take care of them with the rest of the things. When I went to bed, I was so tired, that I put them under my bed, and did not put them in her buddle.</p>

I had occasion to go out shortly afterwards for a particular book, and I missed it. I thought it might be in the shop. I went to look for it, but could not find it. I went out again and missed another. My suspicions were immediately raised against the prisoners whom I saw talking together close by. I searched them and found one on one, and the other on the other.</p>

I told him I had something else to do, and I went into the parlour, he followed me; I was very much alarmed. I went out and called Mr. Kirkley, as if he was at home. I saw the prisoner take the watch off the mantle piece. He was frightened, put it down again, and ran off.

When he entered our service, I informed him, that his two predeciatars had robbed me of considerable property, and I must always have the priviledge of searching his pockets. This he agreed to. On Wednesday the 17th of this month I went into the warehouse between two and three. When I opened the door I saw him recovering himself from stumbling, and he made rapid haste up to me. I asked him what was the master. He said he was only coming up to see who was at the door; I asked him what made him stumble, he said something on the floor; I asked him what he had in his hand, he said nothing. I then laid hold of his arms, and insisted on knowing what his hand contained; I opened it, and there were two nutmegs in it. I had some nutmegs in the warehouse, I said, it was very strange, after what I had told him He said, he did not rob me for a profit; he acknowledged that the nutmegs were my property, and that he had taken them for a pain it his stomach. Conceiving that me might have more about his person, I went for a constable, and insisted on searching him; I searched him, and found in his trowsers, a hask of twine; I asked him if that was for a pair in his stomach, and he said no, it was to make a fishing net. I felt on the outside of his trowsers, and two more pieces of twine were taken out. He said they were all to make a fishing net.</p>
               <p>MR. BAUCK CHINA. I was in the house of the prosecutors, learning their business. I had examined the warehouse in the way of business a few days previous,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210017"/>and there were then three quarters of a pound of nutmegs in a drawer. After we searched the prisoner, we examined the drawer, and found all the nutmegs gone.</p>

            , she was with me. I met the prisoner by appointment, for the purpose of purchasing some counterfeit three shilling pieces. I was employed by the Bank. I had but few words with Phillips. I met him by appointment at ten o'clock; and he appointed the same hour on Sunday morning, Saturday being their sabbath. I met him accordingly at that hour, the next morning, we did not say a word. We walked up the lane, and he gave me two dozen three shilling pieces, and I gave him two one pound notes. He sold the counterfeit pieces at half price; and he gave me four shillings change. I was parting with him, when I heard somebody cry out,</p>
               <p>"a nose" meaning an informer. Immediately Phillips turned round and knocked me down, beat me most violently and a whole mob of jews gathered round; every one of whom had a knock at me. The prisoner ransacked my pockets, and took out the four shillings, and some of the others took from me a tobacco box, a knife, and a pocket handkerchief. There was a general cry of</p>
               <p>"a mad dog, kill him, kill him." I received a severe injury in my inside, from the various kicks and bruises which I received.</p>
               <p>The witness on his cross-examination could give no particular account how he got his living. He had been in service; he had been before a magistrate about stealing a handkerchief and fighting. At length he so much prevaricated and contradicted himself, that Mr. Serjeant Bosanquet, who was counsel for the prosecution, was oblidged to forego any further proceeding.</p>

I found it impossible to drive my cart up the yard as it was full of waggons and carts. I accordingly took the bundle and went up the yard with it. When I returned, the prisoner Ewer was at the tail of the cart; I took the second, and went up the yard with it. When I came back, he was in the same place; on my return after delivering the third, I missed the parcel containing the articles named in the indictment; I received information that the prisoners had taken the parcel out of the cart. Immediately I saw the prisoner run out of Phillip-lane, and make his way along Addle-street. A gentleman stopped him; I went up to him, and made him, go along with me. Going back again, up Phillip-lane, I saw a great crowd; Johnson the officer was there, he had arrested the other prisoner. I am sure Ewer is the person I saw at the tail of the cart, and who was afterwards running away. I never saw the other prisoner until I saw him in the custody of Johnson.</p>
               <p>Cross examined. Other persons might have taken this bundle out of the cart, and I might have been none the wiser. When I met the prisoner Ewer in Phillip-lane, he went with me very readily.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday afternoon I was standing talking to two gentlemen in Phillip-lane; when I saw the prisoner Silvester with a heavy parcel on his back, and Ewer close behind him with his hat off; scratching his head, and wiping it, as if in a prespiration. I immediately laid hold of Silvester, and Ewer ran away. When I laid hold of Silvester, he tried to throw the bundle on me; I turned it off and held him tight. I requested the gentleman to go after Ewer; I had plenty to do to secure Silvester; he made very great resistance. Both the prisoner's were talking when I first saw them.</p>

I turned round and looked at him; and took particular notice of him. I had not gone two yards, before I put my hand into my left hand waistcoat pocket, and missed two three shilling pieces.

I took two three-shilling pieces in change at the Chapman's Arms, where the landlord always marks all three-shilling pieces that come into his house, with the figure three; and then if they are bad, he will take them back. I am sure the prisoner is the person who pushed me.</p>

            . I am a watchman at Bromley. On the night of the 3rd or the morning of the 4th of May, I saw the prisoner and two other men with sacks on their backs. I went for assistance; I suspected they had nothing which belonged to them. As soon as I came up to them, they threw down the sacks and ran away. I am sure the prisoner was one of the men; I knew him before; I picked up the sacks, and took them home. In the sacks were three geese, and nine goslings; and that morning I was told, that a turkey hen was runing about; and I took her. I went to Stratford, and then to Westham, and there I found Mr. Hudson had lost these things. (Here the poultry were produced, and sworn to by Miss Hudson.) It was twenty minutes past three, when I saw the prisoners; it was getting light. It was light enough to see any one. It was light enough to recognise a person I had seen before. I knew the prisoner before. The prisoner was taken up three weeks afterwards. I had seen him after this affair, before he was taken up. I did not apprehend him; he did not seem at all surprised nor alarmed. I did not attempt to secure him, because I had no assistance at hand.</p>

               <p>RICHARD JAMES. I am a watchman in the West India Export Docks. On Sunday night the 22nd of May, I heard a noise a little before ten; it was a noise, as if somebody was being severely beaten. I listened again and heard it repeated. At first it did not appear to be so far off as the ship William. I then went towards where I thought it came from, and there I heard it for twenty minutes of time continued; I then was almost convinced that the noise came from the ship William; but that ship not being in my division of the watch, I took no further notice of it. I communicated what I heard to Parsons, and somebody else, when they came round; there were some ships at anchor round the William, there was one at her head; another at her stern, and three or four between her and me; perhaps she might be two hundred yards from me or more.</p>

            . I am a constable in the West India Docks; I remember the night of Sunday the 21st of May; I was on watch between twelve and one. I stood by the side of the ship William, in consequence of hearing, as I thought, some noise proceed from her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Where was she - A. Close to the quay. I stood by her a little time, and all was perfectly quiet. We then went our rounds, and had proceeded about between three and four hundred yards from the vessel, when we heard the noise on board the ship again, I mean the ship William. We saw the prisoner sitting on the side of the ship, as if he intended to jump on shore. His legs were hanging outside; It was high water, and the deck of the ship was considerably above the quay; from seven to ten feet higher than the quay. The prisoner was shouting out murder. When I first heard the noise, it was loud and violent. When we saw the prisoner he was using expressions that we could not understand. When we came near to him, we heard him scream murder; and he said, he was in hell and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210020"/>devils were tormenting him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Before you heard him use these expressions could he see you - A. He might see the light; but I should explain to you that when we heard the cry of murder, there was a number of ships in a line between him and us, and at different distances; as we walked along he might have seen us through the spaces between the ships; but that would depend upon our situation.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first heard the noise, could he see you - A. I do not know. He could not, unless he saw between the opening of two ships, because there was a corner; but when we got within thirty yards of him, he could have seen the light distinctly. We went up close to the side of the ship where he was sitting in the situation I have described. He was crying out murder! saying he was in hell, and the devils were tormenting him. We desired him to go on board the ship; he did, and we followed him. He said he had killed one of his tormentors and wounded all the rest.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. What state of mind did he appear in - A. In a very disturbed state of mind. We held the light up to look at him, and saw he had no coat nor waistcoat on, and his hands and face were extremely bloody. We asked him where the people were that had been tormenting him. He said if we would go with him he would shew us. We looked all over the upper deck, the hatchways were all closed up. We looked all round the forecastle, but we could not find any person on board but the prisoner. Not finding any one, we asked the prisoner where the man was that he had murdered; when pointing to the fore peake, he said he is down there, I threw him down there - that is were they keep the coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there any coals there - A. I don't know; there was a great deal of rubbish below. I desired my partner, Winnel, to go down with the light. He went down; I saw him shake his head; he said, it is so, here is the man, and he is dead enough. I told the prisoner to go down into the fore peake. He went down and I followed him. When I went down, I told my partner to see if life was extinct. We told the prisoner to lift the body up for it was jammed up in a corner. He lifted it up perfectly unconcerned. There was a great deal of blood, and I thought the throat was cut; I felt, but it was not; the body had on a worsted shirt and a pair of duck trowsers. His neck was quite cold, but his head, and other parts of his body were warm. We found a very large wound on the back part of his head, and his arm was very much bruised. He had only one arm. We saw a great quantity of pieces of wood lying about some might be four inches square; there was part of a broken handspike, there was particularly the piece, I observed with nails in it. These pieces of wood were in the fire-peake. I should have said in the forecastle where the body appeared to have been thrown from down into the peake. There was a good deal of blood, I can't say how much there was. There was some human hair sticking to a piece of wood with the nails in it. That piece of wood was covered with blood.</p>
               <p>COURT. Can you judge whether the blood which was on it spurted on it, or whether that was the piece of wood which inflicted the wound - A. We did not examine it close enough to be able to say. We asked the prisoner, how he came to murder the man, and what he had murdered him with; he said the man would not let him go up the ladder, and he fetched him a rap with a piece of wood. He then began to relate, that he had written a letter to his wife that evening, I asked him where it was; and he said it was on the cabin table; I asked him where the key of the cabin was, he said the keys were in the deceased pockets I told him to go and fetch them, and he did. He unlocked the cabin door we went in and found the letter as he described on the table.</p>
               <p>(The letter produced.)</p>
               <p>That is the letter. We then took the prisoner into custody, and took him to the watchhouse, he seemed to conduct himself orderly there. I saw him at his examination before the magistrate. He there seemed much confused, and in the same state he was on board the ship. I saw him on the Tuesday following, he then seemed perfectly sober and sensible. He said he did not recollect me, he did not know me. I asked him how this unhappy affair happened. he said he did not know he did it; he had not the least animosity towards the deceased. He said he had been many a voyage with him; I told him I had that letter which he had written for his wife. I asked him if I should write a copy of it, and send it to her; he said no, he did not wish that I should; and he hoped I would give that letter to him. He gave me directions to write another letter to his wife, together with her address.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Now during the time you were on board the ship did he seem prompt and ready in his answers, or did he hesitate at all - A. I don't recollect that he hesitated at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did he appear, in the same disturbed state of mind the first time he was before the magistrate as when he was on board the ship - A. He seemed perturbed then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he as deranged before the magistrate as he was on board the ship - A. He said but little; but as far as we could judge he was perturbed. I was before the magistrate with him the second day but not the first. On the Thursday he appeared to be as sensible and as collected as I am now.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you stated that murder was shouted out - A. Shouted out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are we to understand that it came from a disturbed mind - A. Very much so. He said he was in hell, and with devils.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he then appear disturbed - A. He appeared very much disturbed.</p>
               <p>Q. He killed one man, and wounded all the rest; but there was no rest to kill - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. From the manner he delivered these expressions what was your opinion of him - A. At that moment I conceived the man not at all right.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever entertained a different opinion from the opinion which what you then saw gave you - A. I have. There was one circumstance he stated on coming to himself; on the Tuesday morning, that he had not known where he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did you think on the Thursday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210021"/>morning that he was seen in his mind, and do you still continue to think so - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you saw him in the watchhouse, was he then composed - A. Something more so than when he was on board the ship.</p>
               <p>

            . I am a constable of the West India Docks. On the 21st of May I was on duty in company with the last witness. I had heard a noise before, and when I heard it again it was about half past twelve; according to my judgment it proceeded from the William; I was about three hundred yards from her; I had a light in my hand. The prisoner was sitting on the side of the vessel about midship. When we walked up along side, he reached down to take the light; I bid him go on board again, which he did. We went up the side, had went over to the gangway, and asked him what was the matter. He said, that the devil, and captain Derby, theives, and spirits were in the ship, and that they had been tearing his heart out. That the devil had been running after him through the ship, and wanted to put him on a spit and roast him; he said he had killed one man, and wounded all the rest; we asked him where they were, and he said they were all below. I saw that all the hatchways were locked, and we were obliged to go down the forecastle. I told him to come down, which he did, and my partner after him. I looked all round the forecastle and down the hold, with a light, but could see nothing; I asked him where he had put the man he had murdered, he said, he had put him down that hole, pointing to the forepeake of the ship, where they keep the coals; that place is very small, the body was down in the hole, it was up in one corner of it, and could not have been there without somebody going down and putting it there. According to my opinion, he was murdered in the forepeake, and not in the forecastle. I did not see any blood in the forecastle, but a drop or two on the blanket. The deceased had but one arm, was small made, and by no means so stout or strong as the prisoner. He had no coat on, but a kind of canvass jacket and trowsers; I went down into the hole, the prisoner was there with me, and I said you have murdered the man; he composely said, to be sure I have. At the place where the body had first lain, before it had been removed into the corner, there was a great deal of blood on the coals and sticks. I think the man was thrown down into the hole and then murdered there; there was a great deal of blood on the wood; there was a great many pieces of wood, and it seemed that the wood had been divided by the body falling head first, and then the body was stowed away up in the corner; the body was two or three yards from where it was first thrown. The prisoner was in the hole with me, and so was my partner; I sat down, for the place would not allow me to stand up; I told the prisoner to bring the body over to me, he did; and brought the head close to me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. In the situation in which the body was would it have been seen in open day - 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person395">A. </persName>
            You could not see into the hole at all.</p>
               <p>COURT. Then the body was in a place in which it would have been visible in the day time - A. It was, I took notice of the hand-spike; I saw the other piece of wood with nails in it which was covered with blood; I did not take notice of the nails in it at first; but afterwards I did; according to my opinion, I should think the wound was inflicted by the sticks, and not by the fall; indeed he told me so afterward.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You say this place was very small, was there room enough to give the blows in it - A. The place was very narrow; they might have been given with a small stick. I subsequently asked the prisoner what he had killed the man with, and he said with some pieces of wood. He seemed composed, and all the question I asked him, he answered me without hesitation.</p>
               <p>COURT. When you told him he must go along with you, what was his answer - A. He said very well, and seemed quite content; we asked him how he came to commit this horrid murder, he said he had written a letter which was on the cabin lable, and which would tell us all about it; we found the cabin door was locked; we asked him where the keys were, he said in the cooks (meaning the deceased's) pockets. He went back to the forecastle, and felt in the deceased's pocket; they were not there; he then moved the chest and took the keys from behind it; he gave us the keys, neither of us could unlock the door; he took the bunch of keys which consisted of nine, and found out the right key, and unlocked the door; we went into the cabin and there we found the letter as he had described.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Did he appear composed at this time - A. Why sometimes he did, but at other times he used very queer expressions. We read the letter, but found it contained nothing relative to the murder. We took him out of the ship, and took him to the watchhouse; as we were going along the watchman were crying two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. As you were going along, did he appear aware you were taking him in custody, and that he was under restrain - A. I think so, certainly, we took him to the watchhouse, and went away, and returned in about an hour with Mr. Gibson. The first words he said when we came back, that the devils and Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person396">Derbyshire</persName>
             were in the watch-house, and that he could have no rest there; we stopped with him, and took off his coat to show our master and the watchhouse keeper the blood on his shirt; he looked at me very earnestly in the face, and said, what the devil, have you been telling him what I have done; and seemed well aware that he had done something amiss. He was locked up that night, and I did not see him until the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The last witness was with me the whole of the time, he might have heard the expressions relating to Captain Derbyshire's ghost, he used it several times. Latham might have heard him say that the devils wanted to roast him on a spit, he used all these incoherent expressions more than once and Latham had as good an opportunity of hearing them as I had. At times the prisoner seemed very perturbed in his mind, seemed very much deranged, and looked very wild.</p>
               <p>Q. Did these expressions seem to come from a man in his inward reason - A. Why sometimes I thought he was out of his mind, at other times he answered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210022"/>me so composely; that I thought he had plenty of reason. The ship was close up to the side.</p>

            . I am beadle of the parish. The prisoner was delivered to my care.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. During the time that he was under your care, how did he conduct himself generally? did he seem out of his mind - A. At times he conducted himself as if he was out of his mind; at other times not, Some times he appeared perfectly in his sound senses.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you at any time enabled to judge whether he knew he was in custody - A. Certainly he did.</p>
               <p>JOHN PARSONS. I am the witness, who in consequence of some communication which I received of a noise on board the William, went on board about half past eleven. I looked down into the forecastle, and called below; a person answered, whom I afterwards discovered was the deceased. I asked who was making the noise below; is it any one hurting the one armed man; the voice replied no; it is the one armed man you are speaking to. Immediately there was a confusion on the occipital bone, and on the left side, there was a second fracture on the parvidal bone, which had penetrated the skull, and entered the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you judge whether these wounds were inflicted by a fall; or by blows - A. One fall would not have made all the wounds. There were other wounds in the front of the face; one under the right eye, and several other small ones. The lacerations on the head were great, but the fractures small; the one on the parvidal bone as if made by a nail driven in. It might happen that a fall head foremost down this hole upon a heap of scraggy pieces of wood with nails in some of them, might occasion both wounds on the head, and even the bruise on the arm. But I don't think such a fall could have occasioned the wounds on the face at the same time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you think that the wounds were inflicted by such an instrument as this, (shewing the witness the piece of wood with the nails in it) - A. I do. There were several dents on the face, which appeared to be inflicted by such an instrument as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210023"/>20th of May last, between eleven and twelve, he wanted to go to sleep on the bench in the bar; he said, he had been to the Swan with Five Necks, and the Crown, in Ladd-lane; I thought by the manner in which he came in, that he was not right in his mind; he said a great many things that I could not understand.</p>
               <p>HARDY ROBINSON. I am clerk to a cheesemonger, in Newgate-street. I observed the conduct of the prisoner at the Dolphin; at first I said he was more I have than fool, his conduct was very strange; he said he had come to town by the Liverpool mail, and that he had heard some people at the Crown conspiring to take away his life, and that they had followed him to the Dolphin; he insisted on having a bed, I told him I thought he was more knave than fool; he said, do you think I am come here to deceive you. He represented himself as Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person398">Foy</persName>
            ; by his conduct I think he was out of his senses.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Do you mean to swear that he was in that state of mind, as not to know right from wrong; or that he did not know it was harm to cut a man's throat - A. I do not mean to swear to that.</p>
               <p>JAMES CROOKSHANK. I was at the Dolphin and I observed the conduct of the prisoner, and thought he was out of his senses.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Mill-place, Commercial-road, Captain Derbyshire lodged with me. I never saw the prisoner until he called at my house on the 21st of May, at about half past seven, He seemed very much agitated, and was talking to himself when he was in the room, before Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person400">Derbyshire</persName>

             went into the kitchen to be shaved, and the hair dresser left his hat in the room with the prisoner; the prisoner fastened himself in the parlour, and would let nobody come in, I went to the door, and begged him to open it, he said, he would not until Captain 
               <persName id="t18150621-43-person402">Derbyshire</persName>
             came, but afterwards he did. When we went in, he had the poker in his hand, and was muttering something to himself; I went up to him, and took hold of his hand, and asked him to compose himself; he muttered a great deal, and said, I had secreted a woman in the house. During the time I had this conversation with him, he seemed to be a deranged man, and out of his senses.</p>

            . I am a nurse in one of the wards in the London Hospital. The deceased was brought there on the 19th of May, and remained there until her death: on the 9th of June, she was perfectly sensible all the time, and thought she never would recover. During every conversation I had with her, she used to say, that the way this affair happened was, that she was fastened up in the room and the prisoner was sharpening his knife, and swore he would stab her; which threat she was afraid he would put into execution from his violent conduct on a former occasion. The prisoner constantly visited her until her death, and always seemed very much affected with her situation.</p>

            . I am a pupil attending the London hospital. The deceased was brought to the hospital on the 19th of May, and expired on the 9th of June. She had a fracture on one of the bones forming the hip joint. From the first day she entered the hospital until she expired, she daily grew worse and worse.</p>

At four o'clock on the morning of the 19th, I went out to look for the deceased as she had stayed out all night; she lived with me, I found her quite drunk, and brought her home; she wanted to have something to drink in the room, and I would not suffer her, and locked the door. When I was at work, being a shoemaker, I was sharpening my knife, and the deceased went over to the window and threw herself out; I had no time to save her.</p>

I continued my watch, and followed her to Miss Smail's; she stood talking, and bought a neat's foot, and gave a shilling in payment; I followed the boy, when he went to get change, and saw him go into the public house; both he and I marked the shilling; while we were there, I went to Miss Smail's, and took the prisoner into custody; I took her into a back room and searched her, and on her I found a piece of blue paper containing three shillings, each wrapt up separately in a piece of blue paper, so that they might not scratch. They have been in my possession ever since, and here they are.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. I am solicitor for the mint, I am in the habit of inspecting counterfeit money. These three shillings are counterfeits, and are of the same manufacture as the one proved to have been tendered. They are quite fresh.</p>

            . I keep the French Horn, in Beech-street, I don't know the woman at the bar. There was a woman came to my house about eight o'clock on the evening of the 8th of June, and asked for a glass of liquor, which she drank, and which came to two pence; she tendered me a sixpence, which I said was bad; she said it was good; said, very well, and gave her the change. The moment she went out, Mr. Johnson came in; he asked me what money that woman gave me, I shewed him the sixpence; he desired me to mark it, I did, and I believe he marked it also; there was no body else tendered me a sixpence before, and Mr. Johnson came in so quick, that he saw the woman go out.</p>
               <p>- . I live at the Globe Tavern, Moorgate. The woman at the bar, is something like a woman, who on the 8th of June came in and asked for a glass of gin, she paid for it with a sixpence and I gave her the change; Mr. Johnson then came in. and asked what money the woman had given me, I gave him the sixpence, which had been lying on the desk and was not put into the till. I have got it now, and here it is. The woman at the bar is like the woman who tendered the sixpence, and no other woman had tendered a sixpence.</p>

I know the prisoner at the bar, she came to my sisters shop, at about half past nine, on the evening of the 8th of June, and purchased a sheet of paper in payment for which she tendered a sixpence, and received five pence change; I put the sixpence into the till; I am sure there was no other sixpence there. In about ten minutes, Mr. Johnson came in I shewed him the sixpence, he desired me to mark it, which I did, with a pair of shears, and he came for it the next morning; I have seen the woman before.</p>

I, said it was bad, and told her to change it; she had, drank the gin; just then Mr. Johnson came in, and by his desire, I kept the sixpence, he desired me to mark it; he took her into custody.</p>

            . I am an officer. I know the prisoner at the bar for some time to be a common utterer of base money, I saw her on the evening in question a little before seven; she went into the French Horn in Beech-street. As soon as she came out I went in, I got the sixpence there; the landlord marked it, and so did I; I told him to keep it safe, and I afterwards called for it, and got it. I next saw the prisoner go into the Globe at Moorgate; I went in there after she came out; I had looked through the window and saw her tender a sixpence, I went in and marked it, and the landlord marked it too; I followed her down London Wall; and when she came to St. Helens, she went into a stationers shop that was shut up; I did not go in directly, but first followed her to Mrs. Hockley's, she there tendered another sixpence, I desired the lady to keep it; I searched her at Mrs. Hockley's I found sixpence in halfpence, on her and a good sixpence; I then went to Mrs. Berkeley's, and there I got the sixpence she had tendered there, Miss Berkeley marked it with a pair of shears. I next went to the prisoners lodgings where I found a punch stuck up against the wainscoat; it has a mark on it, and is evidently the same instrument with which these sixpences were cut, as each of them has a similar mark. There was a little cream of tartar also and a hammer, also a lapstone which appeared to have had copper beaten on it, and a piece of copper plated, but not cut round. Here are the sixpences which were tendered at the houses of the different witnesses; I have had them in my possession ever since, and they are all marked.</p>
               <p>MR. POWELL. I am solicitor for the Mint, I am in the habit of inspecting counterfeit money. These sixpences are all counterfeit, they are merely marked and are exactly of the same manufactory.</p>

I saw both prisoners together in Giltspur-street; I observed Addison, go into a baker's shop, Coyle went right across Smithfield and waited for him. I saw Addison through the window tendering a three shilling piece and heard it ring; he then came out and joined Coyle's. He went then to the pork shop, and Coyle went down the lane, Addison came out directly and I went in; Mrs. Macbeath shewed me a three shilling token which he passed to her that is it. The force shilling piece shewn to the witness. I went out and saw them join company again, and saw Addison give Coyle something in Charterhouse-square. They then went to Warwick's shrimp shop, Addison stopped and Coyle went into Greville-street, my brother officer, Matthews, who was with me, followed him, and I watched Addison. They then went into a chandlers shop, Addison alone, and got some bread for which they tendered a three shilling piece Coyle went away and left Addison in the shop; I saw him give her a three shilling piece, which I afterwards told her to mark. I secured Addison with a good deal of difficulty, and took him over the way where I searched him; I found the pig's foot upon him and the things he had bought, but not a halfpenny in money; I saw Coyle searched.</p>

            . I see the tokens, they are counterfeits, and appear to be quite fresh, they are merely washed, and wont bear rubbing.</p>
               <p>MR. HARVEY. I make the same observations, those tokens proved to have been tender by Addison are exactly of the same manufacture and both struck with the same die.</p>
               <p>Addison's Defence. I took this three shilling piece; thinking it was good, it I had not thought so, I would not have passed it.</p>
               <p>Coyle's Defence. I am quite a stranger in London, I have not been here ten days, I merely went out to walk with Addison; the three shilling pieces that were found upon me, I did not know were bad, your lordship might be equally liable to take them. I have a wife and four small children, I hope the court will be merciful.</p>

I went to them and told them, they must go away, which they did, into Edgeware road. I saw no more of them until I had to go down John-street, when they were there again; I told them to go away quietly. The prisoner came over and told me I was a d - d old b - r, and asked me what I had to do with him? I told him I wanted him to go along quietly. He asked me did I know who he was, I told him I did not, nor did I care; he said then I shall let you know; he produced a pistol, and laid it across the back of his left hand, it was directed in a right line to me; he snapped it at the upper part of my body; if it had gone off, it could not have missed me; I attempted to secure the prisoner but he snapped the pistol a second time, it shewed fire both times. He then ran away and ran after the man and woman, he was afterwards apprehended in John-street. I am sure the man at the bar is the man who snapped the pistol.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prisoner appeared to be quite drunk, he was able to walk, but he staggered very much; he had not been creating any disturbance at the time I spoke to him, and when he first snapped the pistol; at the time he put the pistol up I went over to him to take him by the collar. I had no intention of striking him, I was going to take I him up for the violent name he had called me. saw the flint give fire, and it was not the cracking of the pistol lock.</p>

Chelsea where I was going to sleep; I can't tell what time the prisoner came. He would not come to bed, and I went to bed before him; he gave no tea on for not going to bed and fell asleep, leaving the prisoner standing with his back against the wall by the bed side. He tried three or four times if the door was fast, I wakened about half past one, and the prisoner was standing still in the same place; I told him to come to bed, for he must be tired after his march. I was laying with my right arm across my breast, and he stabbed me in the arm. The men in the room got up, and said there was murder in the room, and a general confusion ensued, when the prisoner was taken into custody.</p>

I am a poor old soldier, and came to get some sleep that night at this house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210028"/>The men who were in the house, and who slept in the room, were teazing me the whole of the afternoon, because I was an Irishman; I requested they would not teaze me, and if they would not, I would give them anything they chose to drink; they very readily drank all the money I had, amounting to ten shillings, all that was left of my marching money. When the money was gone, they again commenced teazing, and I was very much afraid of them. When I went up into the room, I had never seen this man; the rest of the men went to bed. I assure your lordship I was afraid of my life, and did not lie down but stood against the wall all night. I thought if they should attract me I had no means to defend myself, I searched about the room and found on the table a piece of an old rusty razor, which I wrapped up in a stocking to defend myself, I had no malice against any of them; presently some of them got up to teaze me again when they found I would not get into bed; and a man was coming round behind me, and I made a blow at him; immediately there was a watchman sent for; I was taken to the watchhouse, and remained there all night; if I hurt any one, it was not with any malice, but merely in my own defence, I was afraid of my life.</p>

Between eleven and twelve o'clock, in the morning of the 24th of May, the prisoner came into our shop, and asked for half a pound of beef steak, it came to four pence halfpenny, and he gave me a three shilling piece to pay for it, which. I put into the desk, and which was the only one of the new coin I had, for the new coin the head is considerably larger than in the old. As soon as he went out at one door, Mr. Johnson came in at the other, and asked me what money I had received from the prisoner; I gave him the three shilling piece, he marked it in my presence, but I did not. Mr. Johnson called for it in about half an hour; I am positive as to the person of the prisoner.</p>

I am an officer, I saw the prisoner on Wednesday the 24th of May about ten o'clock in the morning, in company with another man in Thomas-street; they went down Distaff-lane, and there the prisoner went into Mr. Pocklington's While the prisoner was in the shop, I slipped myself up a Court opposite, I knew that situation; I commanded a view of the shop; I saw him receive some meat, and some change; there were two doors, to the shop, and as soon as the prisoner came out at me I went in at the other. The prisoner and the other man joined company; I found they passed a bad three shilling piece there which I marked, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210029"/>then followed him into Cannon-street. The prisoner there left his commission and went into the Cock and Bottle, the other man went up Abchurch-yard; I went in when the prisoner came out, and by enquiry of Mr. Hale, I learned what had happened; she gave me a three shilling piece, which she had marked; I left the three shilling piece until I returned, I then went in pursuit again; and in crossing Corn-hill I saw the prisoner crossing the 'Change and I think I saw the other man going down the Hill; I took the prisoner into custody; and on searching him, I found upon him two three shilling pieces wrapt up in paper, and there were eight others where I found them seperate; there was other money in the other breeches pocket, here they are. This is the one I received from Mrs. Pocklington, and this from Mr. Hale.</p>

            . I am a shipping clerk to Messrs. Hibbert and Company; who are wine and spirit merchants in Jury-street; I saw the puncheons of rum filled up, and the samples were taken out afterwards; they were not spiled when they were put into the boat, if they had been I must have seen it; the side of the boat was lared, and by the spirit runing on it, it was turned quite white.</p>

            . I was waterman at the water-gate, in the West India Docks, the prisoner is an Excise watchman. Moody came up to me and said he was going to get a drop of rum, and I might as well have a shilling or two as not; he then walked up the basin side, and said, go you to your post, I have got a fellow here, that will get a drop in no time; he then went up the side of the Basin, towards the guard room, and in two or three minutes he returned in company with another man, whom I knew by sight not by name. The man seemed afraid of me, but Moody said, you be not afraid of him, because I know him very well. They then went and hauled the boat away from where she was, opposite the guard house, and there the other man went on board the boat, and was there about three quarters of an hour; Moody said, he was a d - d long while about it. He then handed two bladders to me while Moody was by him, I don't know whether they were full; the man brought one or two in his hand. When they came on shore, I asked them how they were going to get rid of it; one of them said they would get it over the wall: they put one of the bladders underneath the slider, and then went over the wall with the rest, I permitting them. I saw no more of them until they came back, and then Moody gave me ten or twelve shillings in three shilling pieces. We then went and sit down in a box, and there was a drop drawn off to drink; one of the constables came by at the time, and the prisoner proposed to let him drink; he sat down with us, and drank with us. Another constable came, and he drank with us also. We then seperated, and Moody proposed to get a drop more for ourselves; the same man went again, and got some more, and they gave me some in a skin.</p>
               <p>Mr. Adolphus. Then Moody knew that you were such a thief, that he told the other man he need not be afraid of you - A. I don't know his opinion as to that.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose you never knew anything of this kind to be done before - A. I don't know for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it you who proposed to take the rum - A. Not to my knowledge. What should I propose it for, when he had a man already.</p>

She had not been with me more than one month, before I missed a broach with hair in it, and a five pound Bank note, they were taken out of a drawer in the two pair of stairs back room; I had missed considerable sums of money out of my drawers from time to time, but did not know whom to suspect; after she had been some time with me, I was informed she was without money, and I gave her two guineas I told her several times that I missed my property, but she always declared her innocence, and I had not the slightest suspicion of her, because I received a most excellent character of her. I was sitting one morning in my parlour, about eleven o'clock, when the other prisoner, who was accustomed to come and talk to her at the door, though I had forbidden male followers, came and asked for her. In a short time afterwards she went by the window with a white linen bag and a small pair of drawing-room bellows; from that moment I took the alarm; I am in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210031"/>habit of leaving my, money on the and of the side board, while I dress myself and have missed it several times; I went to the house of the other prisoner in company with an officer; in consequence of my having had some conversation with Mr. Fielding, the magistrate, he the prisoner and another man were weaving in the room, I saw my property. There was the white bag tied up, just as it had passed my window, and a variety of things on the mantle piece, and about the room. We asked him how he came by the different things, and he made a full confession that

             had given him the whole of the things; and that the morning when I saw the white bag go by the window, he was in the neighbourhood with a cart to take away her boxes and things. He confessed also that she had given him eleven pounds in notes; with that money he had bought a loom, and was working as a weaver. The prisoner Collins was not at that time dismissed from my service. He said she had given him the wine that was in the bottle; the officer found the broach; the silver bottle lables were taken off my bottles; he confessed that all the things that were there of my property he had received of her. We then put the things into a hackney coach, stepped in, and drove home; she opened the door, the officer came into the house, and told her she was his prisoner. The articles were produced to her seperately, and she said at first to each, she had not taken it; and then afterwards confessed she had; and one by one, she confessed the whole.</p>

On the morning of the 12th of May, the prisoner at the bar, called upon me and told me Viglezzi had had a piece of lace stolen, and he told me that Viglezzi had a strong suspicion of him. In the course of the afternoon Viglezzi called on me, and communicated to me the circumstances, together with his suspicion; hearing that the prisoner had got a birth on board a ship lying at Graveshend, to go to Italy. I went to Hatton Garden office, and dispatched an officer thence for the purpose of detaining the prisoner; the officer went down to Graveshend, and brought him up; at his commitment at Hatton Garden, I heard him acknowledge that he took the things out of the room of Viglezzi, and pawned them in Piccadilly.

I went into the pantry; and after remaining there some time about my business, I heard a noise, and turning round, I saw the next witness and the prisoner in the kitchen.

               <p>GEORGE VAUGHAN. I am an officer, belonging to the public office at Bow-street. I was watching the prisoners about four o'clock in the afternoon, of the 16th of June. Just before they came to Temple Bar, there was a gentleman going through, and went up to him, and puffed his handkerchief a little cut of the pocket; when he got a little through the Bar, She pulled it right out, and clapped it underneath his coat. They then turned up a court, made a circuit round Chancery-lane, and that way, and returned down into Pickett-street. I then saw Wilson go into a pawnbroker's shop in Pickett-street; I went in when he came out, and found he had just pawned a handkerchief for three shillings. I had looked for the gentleman whom they had robbed, but missed him in going through the Bar, and could not find him. I met Smith, the beadle, and asked him to assist him; he did; and we went down Fleet-street, and saw them stop and talk to a young man, and sell a duplicate to him; we went up to him, and got the duplicate from him. We then followed the prisoners into Fleet-market, and there we took Thackery and Cross; we took them into a linen-draper's shop, and searched them. Smith assisted me in taking them to Bow-street; when we got there, and had them in the

            , come out of Mr. Eddison's house, with a canvas bag in her possession.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did you stop her - A. I did. I asked her what she had there; her answer was, a few feathers. I asked her where she was going; and she told me to Pancrass. I informed her I was a constable, and she must come back with me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Now, before she said any thing, did you make her any threat, or any promise, or did you say any thing to her, which might induce her to confess - A. I did not. I asked her what she was going to do at Pancrass; she said, she was going to take the feathers to Mrs. Smith; in Edmund-street, near Battle-bridge. I asked her whether she had ever taken any there before; she said, she had, and she had been in the habit of doing so. I asked her whether she used to take them in the manner she was taking these; she said, she had taken some in a tablecloth, which I should find in the one pair back room, at Mrs. Smith's, likewise two tippets in a chest of drawers in the back parlour. She begged very hard for me to let her take the bag which she had when I stopped her, back to her master's, for she should be hanged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Did you take her to Mrs. Smith's - A. I did not. I took her to the Compter, and got to Smith's at about half past nine.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the woman at the bar - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. How did you get into the house - A. Over the wall, and in at the back window, the first thing I saw in the back parlour was, the chest of drawers that Clarke told me of, and upon opening it, I found the two tippets as described by her. Smith was not in the room at the time. As soon as I went out of the parlour, I opened the door, and let in Mr. Eddison, junior; we then went into the one pair of stairs back room, and found an immense quantity of feathers. I saw no person belonging to the house at that time. I saw a pair of scales, hung by the fire side, and there were several bags, which contained feathers, which were picked; in the corner of the room there was a great quantity of feathers loose and picked.</p>
               <p>COURT. This was the room of which Clarke told you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Did any one come in whilst you were there - A. Yes; a boy, who was called by the name of

            , but his proper name is Gatemeads; I got some information from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Smith come in - A. Yes, in about half or three quarters of an hour. I told her then that I came in consequence of some information which I received from Clarke, that some of Mr. Eddison's property was there. I asked her where she got the feathers; she told me she got them from Clarke, to make a bed with, for Mr. Eddison. I asked her whether she got the tippets to make a bed also; she said, no, one was Clarke's, and Clarke had given her the other for her own wear. I asked her where she got the tablecloth; and she said, Clarke had brought feathers in it. When I took her to Guildhall, I asked her if she had ever disposed of any feathers; she said, no; these were the only feathers that were brought to her, and they were for the purpose of making a bed. At first, I thought that I had seen her in Gough-square; and I asked her whether she had been there; but she replied, she had not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pooley. Have you got the feathers here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Nobody can swear to feathers. You must prove their identity from the prisoner's own mouth.</p>
               <p>(The several articles produced by the witness.)</p>
               <p>Witness. These I found in the lodgings of the prisoner Smith, accordingly to the direction I received from Clarke, and they have never been out of my possession since.</p>
               <p>JURY. We should wish to know whether there be any, and if any, what mark upon the tablecloth - A. I. Eddison at full length.</p>

Mrs. Smith had a child of her's to nurse. Mrs. Clarke used often to bring feathers to Mrs. Smith between the hours of six and seven in the morning. I have heard her say that she lived with Mr. Eddison, in the presence of Mrs. Smith. She used to bring the feathers in bags, and once she brought them in a tablecloth; I did not see the tablecloth come in; but I saw it after it was come. I used to be employed in picking feathers; and when they were picked, Mrs. Smith used to send me to sell them to a Mr. Neville, a broker, in Brewer-street, Sommers Town; the first time, I received six shillings for what I took, and another time five; I got eleven shillings altogether; I got two shillings a pound for some.</p>

               <p>Smith's Defence. It all all false.</p>
               <p>Clarke's Defence. When I was first stopt, it was near upon five o'clock. The officer who took me just out of sight of the house, asked me where I was going, and some other questions. He then took me to his own home, and thence to Mr. Smith's in Gough Square; and Mr. Smith told me to make a friend of him, and tell him all about it. The officer then took me to Giltspur-street Compter, and I do not think the prisoner Smith knew that the feathers were stolen.</p>

When I went to bed, I set these things down against the wall; after I got into bed, this woman lay with me for the value of a minute or two; they were both in the room when we got into bed; they took the liberty of lying down by the side of us; we saw them in the public<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181506210035"/>house, before we came there; we paid them for the beds, not knowing but they belonged to the house. They got up, and went down stairs, and came up with the man at the bar; the man asked me what business I had there, I told him I was very tired, and had paid for my bed, and wished to rest myself. He then forced me to get up, and struck me in the face; my bag was gone; Theed got down stairs and fetched the watchman; he asked them what was become of my bag, and they said my friend had taken it down stairs. The watchman searched for the bag all over the house but could not find it. The next time I saw my property, it was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had not been drinking a great deal, I was not drunk; we had had some gin, we might have had a pint; I received a five pound note of my money at Battle bridge, and another at Islington, at strawhat shops.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I know the house well that Leary lives in; Leary denied to the watchman that the girls were in the house; and when we searched, we could not find them they made their escape somehow. When we came back to the house, to search it another time with a constable, they had got into bed with another young man very comfortable, in the same room in which we had been at first. We took Leary and Johnson down to the watchhouse, and they were talking Irish all the way; and they speak that so fast, that I can't understand it; I went the next day to Marlborough-street, I was rather forward but I never was fuddled but twice in my life.</p>

I searched all over the house, when I was ordered back the second time, and then I found Johnson, and took her to the watchhouse, and the third time I took the other prisoner; when I was searching the house, Leary held a light to me; every thing he could do to assist me in searching, he did.

In consequence of an information I received from his landlord where he last lodged, I went to his present lodgings, and there I found an immense quantity of pawnbrokers duplicates, some dated three years ago, others less; we went to the different pawnbrokers, and the last we went to, we found two pair of women's shoes pawned but a few days previous; I told Mr.

On searching him, we found a pair of large men's shoes, one in each breeches pocket, the shoes are new; I can swear to them.</p>

            . I am a watchman in Southampton-buildings. On the morning in Question, I was coming along without my light, and saw the prisoner come out of Southampton-court; that is the court, which communicates to Mr. Northam's premises. I saw something under his arm which appeared like lead, and which, on seeing me, he put down and run away. I pursued after him; as soon as he got to Chancery-lane, I took him, but I brought him back to the spot where he laid down the lead. I took him into custody, and took him to the watchhouse. I found five pieces of lead in all; one on the wall, three in the court, and a large piece in the buildings.</p>

               <persName id="t18150621-78-person686">drew</persName>
             a silk handkerchief from him, wiped his mouth with it, and then put it into his side pocket. I immediately ran across the way and seized him. I tapped the gentleman on the shoulder and told him the circumstance; and he said he just wanted his handkerchief, and missed it. He said the handkerchief was his, in the presence of the prisoner. The gentleman gave me his card, which was, Captain

            , No. 84, Bloomsbury Square; and he said he would wait at Bow-street the next morning; but he did not. On enquiring at No. 34, Bloomsbury Square, I was told he was an <rs id="t18150621-78-viclabel450" type="occupation">India Captain</rs>

I told him not to keep late hours; but he did not come till after we were in bed. I let him in; the parlour was his bed room. I had put a sallad bowl with my clean linen in it, on the top shelf in the cupboard. He said, he would put out the candle. I went up stairs and watched, and perceived that the candle was moved, and that it was in the closet. I immediately went down stairs and the things taken out of the closet, and the spoons under the bed. I thought he was robbing the house, and my husband called the watch.</p>

I saw him jump up against the wall, and the other prisoner threw a bundle over the wall. I went directly to the watchman, and told him to take these two men into custody. The watchman said he would not, and I said I would. I went up to them and asked them where the bundle was; and they said, what bundle? damn your eyes, what is it to you. They both started and ran off. I cried stop thief, and pursued them; and Smith was turning back to come towards me, when I picked up a brick-bat, and swore I would knock either of them down if they came near me.
