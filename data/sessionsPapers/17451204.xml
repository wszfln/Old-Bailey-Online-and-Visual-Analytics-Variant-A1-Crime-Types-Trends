            . I am a Clerk at the Bank. This Note was brought to me, and he that brought it said he came from Mr. Phipps. I told him it was a stopt Note, and asked who he took it of; and he said there was a Person in his Master's Shop that brought it, and I told him he must bring the Person to the Bank, that he might make out his Claim to it. Mr. Phipps and the Prisoner, I believe it was, came to the Bank, and I went up with them to the Secretary; and Mr. Phipps said that he would go along with him (the Prisoner) to Mr. Neal's. He said at the Bank that he sold some Hair to a Barber, and gave him 8 l. in Change out of the Note; upon which they went away to Mr. Neal's. This Note has been in my Custody ever since the 16th of November: This is the very Note, and it has been in my Possession ever since: Shew it to

He came Home very much wounded, and I asked him how it happen'd; and he said two Men came into the Shop ( the Prisoners at the Bar) and they threatned his Life. The Wound, I believe, was an Inch and a Quarter broad and long; he bled very much; I got him a Pennyworth of Diaculum, and scraped some Lint, and made a Plaister, and put it on, and put him to Bed; and I put a Sheet under his Leg: He bled very much, and had no Sleep that Night, but was Light-headed. There was among the Wheelwrights a Confederacy, or a Combination; and these were those that threatned both Master and Man; and they said that they would do it for them, and they doubled their Fists; and

This Gardner wanted to take her away to her own Lodging, for she said the Watchman would be about by and by, and I was afraid that she would take her Clothes away. She had two Shifts. This was about Twelve o'Clock at Night. After this she carried her into Brown's Gardens, and this was the 2d of November; and she was at the Door, and no body with her but Eliz. Gardner. I thought no more of it. I know this Gardner very well. I know nothing what became of the sick Woman, until I heard that she was in the Round-House, and that the Coroner had sat upon her. I know that this Gown was upon the Woman that is dead.</p>

            . Music; I am of the City-Waits, of Faringdon-Ward. On the 14th of November I came Home about four o'Clock in the Morning, and put my Coat upon the Closet-Door; I laid down, and got up in the Morning, and went to my Mother's, to lie down four or five Hours to refresh myself, that I might go out the next Morning again: But when I came Home to look for my Coat, my Coat was gone; and I sent my Wife to the Pawnbroker's, and there I found the Coat; and I gave three Shillings and a Penny before I could have it; and he (the Pawnbroker) said there was another Woman with the Prisoner at the Bar, and the Prisoner bid her go back and fetch my Hautboy.</p>
               <p>- Butcher. The Coat was brought to my House the 14th of November at seven at Night. I asked her (the Prisoner whose Coat it was? and she said that her Sister sent her with it, and that it was her Brother's Coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know her Sister?</p>
               <p>- Butcher. She has pawn'd Things at my House; she has come from her Sister two or three Times.</p>

               <p>Mills. I was following my Man up Stairs, and found this Man coming down between one Story and half a Story; and I said, my Friend, where are you going? to get a little Sugar? I must see what you have got. He had an Apron hung down to his Knees, and a Bag: There it is: And in that Bag was the Sugar.</p>
               <p>Q. This being found upon him, what did he say?</p>

There were four Quarterns, Three-penny and Two-penny Loaves. He said 20 d. but afterwards he took 18 d. for Basket and Bread, and I sold the Quarterns for Three-pence a Piece, and the Three-penny Loaves for five Farthings a Piece.</p>

There was a Quarrel in the Street between two Women, and I came by, put my Hand into my Pocket, to see if my Money was there, and it was all safe. I walked homewards, and turned into the Court, and when I came within about thirty Yards of my Door, a Man came behind me, and said, d - n you, you Brooks, you are a Rogue and a Villain: And before I could turn to look unto the Man, he knocked me down, and with the second Blow he cut me in this Place; and I had a great many Blows when I was down, and I felt his Hand in my Pocket, and he drew the Money out of my Pocket, and there was seventeen Guineas and a Half Guinea.</p>

               <p>Brooks. I am sure he is the very Man. I never drank with him in all my Life; but he came by my House one Night, and made me a Visit against my Will.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of Night?</p>
               <p>Brooks. About Eleven or Twelve o'Clock at Night; as he was passing by my Door, he said that he thought he heard Murder cried out in my House.</p>

               <p>Brooks. I am an Appraiser of Goods, and lend Money upon Goods.</p>
               <p>Q. You take upon you to swear that he is the Man that knockt you down: Was you quite sober then?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes, my Lord; I had drank but Part of two Pots of Beer with a Man, his Wife and Children.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, before he struck you, he called you Rogue and Villain?</p>
               <p>Brooks. I pursued him that Night, and I said, that I had lost seventeen Guineas and a Half, a Hat, and Wig which was found at the Barber's Door: I pursued him; he lodged at the Bolt-in-Tun Inn. After this I got a Search Warrant, in order to apprehend him, and I searched the Inn several Times, but never found him. At last I was told by one of my Acquaintance, that he was in a safe Place, for he had seen him in the Counter? With that I went to the Poultry Counter, and there I found him.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not you lame?</p>
               <p>Brooks. Yes, I have one Leg shorter than the other, and it cost me 40 l. to cure it, and it was a good Cure too.</p>
               <p>- Chainey. I know nothing of the Robbery. I saw a Quarrel one Sunday Night between Nine and Ten o'Clock, on the 8th of September. I was at my Door in Bolt-in-Tun Court, and saw the Prosecutor and the Prisoner a little before. The Prisoner comes down the Passage, and when he comes up to the Prosecutor, he says, D - n you for a Scoundrel Dog, your Names is Brooks. With that the Prosecutor said, D - n you for a Scoundrel Dog, who do you call Scoundrel? I stepp'd up and desir'd that they would not quarrel; but one Word begat another, and the Prisoner struck Mr. Brooks, and they both went to Fighting; and as soon as the Scuffle was over, the Prisoner walk'd down to the Bolt-in-Tun Inn, and Mr. Brooks came up to me; in the Scuffle his Wig came off. Then Mr. Brooks went Home, and after a few Minutes he came out again, and said that the Villain had robb'd him of 17 Guineas and a Half. Nothing more, my Lord; I saw no more. I heard after, that he went in Pursuit of the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner have his Hand in his Pocket?</p>
               <p>Chainey. No, it was dark, I could not see.</p>
               <p>- Molloy. I was going to Bed, and had just put the Candle out; I heard the Prisoner at the Bar say, You are a Scoundrel. I stood at the Step of my Door, and I saw Mr. Chainey with a Pipe in his Hand, and the Prisoner at the Bar knock'd Mr. Brooks down. I was naked, I did not care to go out naked. I saw the Prisoner upon him. I then being sorry to see my Friend ill us'd, I said, What are you going to rob my Neighbour? And I am about 10 Yards, altho' I was naked, but I return'd back again. Mr. Brooks put his Hand into his Pocket, and said, I am robb'd of all my Gold; he said he was robb'd of 17 Guineas and an Half. I still continu'd in my Shirt. Mr. Chatney went into his House.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>

Do you know for what Reason, in August last, that Brooks was going to destroy his Wife and Child, and came down with a naked Hanger in his Hand; and that the Constable, with others, brought the Woman down Stairs; and that the Prisoner should say, that he was a very dangerous Fellow, and the Constable took Charge of him?</p>
               <p>Dowell. Brooks, speaking of the Prisoner at the Bar, said he was a Gentleman-Thief, and charg'd a Constable with him; and they went to the Watch-House, and when Brooks came there, he did not know what he had lost, but he talk'd of a Piece of Lace that he had he lent 22 Guineas upon that Day; and I saw both the Prisoner and Mr. Brooks going -</p>

               <p>Dowell. I believe it was the Beginning of September. It was on a Sunday Night, about Nine or Ten o'Clock. I heard the Voice of the Prisoner, and Mr. Brooks: I heard that Brooks was roul'd in the Kennel, and dawb'd his Coat. I heard one Molloy ask, if he had lost any Thing? Upon which Brooks said, he had lost some Money; and I heard Mr. Chainey say, There's your Wig. After this I went in a-Doors; and some Time after that he came out of his Door, and he said that he lost 17 Guineas and a Half Guinea; upon which I had a Piece of Flamboy in my Hand, and I light it to look for the Money; but Mr. Brooks call'd me holping<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174512040014"/> Dog: The Neighbours were all about; I found none.

He had made several Notches and Cuts in the Wood of the Bedstead.

It was on a Sunday Night, about Ten or Eleven o'Clock at Night. He told me that in the Fray he had gotten Mr. Brooks's Hat, and beg'd that I would get it sent Home to him. So I ordered the Chamberlain to carry it, but he did not care to have any Thing to do with him: Then I ordered the Cook to carry it, and he ( Brooks ) would not take it of her; she brought it back again. Then I went myself and carried it, and he would not take it of me in any Shape. And then Mr. Molloy went in and said, Mr. Brooks, han't you lost something? and he said after that, that he had lost seventeen Guineas and a Half, a Hat and Wig.</p>

               <p>Sheppard. On the 10th of October out Militia was out, but before they made their firing, their regular firings, I ask'd them if they were all loaded? There were 36 of them, 12 in a Rank. I ask'd them, if they were loaded? And they said they were not; and then again; and they said they were. I was then almost fronting the Prisoner, but at some Distance from him, I believe six Yards; and a Piece of Paper and Wadding hit against my Coat. With that I examin'd who it was that fir'd: I went down the last Rank, which is the third: I ask'd them all, both Right Hand and Left, if they were loaded? I came up the second Rank, I came up between the Prisoner and this young Man; I ask'd them if they were loaded?</p>
               <p>Q. What is this young Man's Name?</p>
               <p>Sheppard. Stephens. They said they were not loaded. Between the 3d and 4th Time I went to see the rest of my Officers; and then the 4th Time I cry'd, Present and fire, and then I was as you now see me.</p>

            </rs>.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, I am Counsel for the Crown, and he stands indicted for High Treason, for counterfeiting the current Coin of this Kingdom. Gentlemen, I am not willing to aggravate this above its Demerit; not to inspire the Breasts of the Jury with Sentiments to prejudice them against the Prisoner at the Bar, who stands upon his Trial for Life or Death. Gentlemen, undoubtedly it is the Prerogative of the Crown to take Care of the current Coin of the Kingdom. The Prisoner at the Bar is indicted for coining of Shillings; and I beg that you would observe how this falls among the working Poor of the Nation. Suppose a Man works hard all Day for a Shilling, and at Night shall receive one of these bad ones, that is not worth a Farthing: What Distress does this bring into a Family, where there is a Wife and Children.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner at the Bar is an old Offender, and hath practis'd it 14 Years; and the Method of finding him out was by Mr. Smith. The Prisoner at at the Bar and Mr. Smith carry'd on this Affair: The first 10 coin, and the last to put them off when coin'd. The better to effect this, they often took Journeys, sometimes to Worcester, sometimes to Newcastle, sometimes to one Place, and sometimes to another; and then, when they took these Journeys, they carry'd a Quantity of these Shillings with them. But Smith happened to be detected at Basingstoke; a Quantity of them were found upon him. He acquainted us that the Person he was concern'd with was one Oakes, and that he liv'd in White-Cross Street. Now Gentlemen, it is not upon the single Testimony or Evidence of Smith that we are endeavouring to prove him guilty; for the Gentlemen of the Mint made an Enquiry, and they found in his Lodgings a great many Pieces ready made, and others almost finish'd; and they found the Instruments to carry on the Work, which are now in our Custody. Mr. Smith has a great many Times, and that Years ago, had Part of that Money to set out of Town withal, and he hath seen him coin it and wash it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, My Lord, put off my Trial for an Hour.</p>

            .) Look at the Prisoner at the Bar. How long have you been acquainted with him.</p>
               <p>Smith. Fourteen Years. My first Acquaintance with him was in the Horse-Grenadiers; about six Years ago was the first Time he said any Thing to me: Says he to me, You have a Family, and he immediately pull'd out of his Pocket three or four Shillings. I went with him to the Noah's-Ark, and he put off one Shilling; and we went to the Coach and Horses, and there he put off another. He found out where I liv'd, and I went along with him, and he put off three or four Shillings at a Time. This pass'd on 'till Witsuntide. He liv'd then in Lamb-Court in Clerkenwell. When I came to see him, I open'd the Door, and I saw him coining with these Things; and there was Whiting and a great many ready coin'd, I believe to the Value of three or four Pounds. I saw with him a Pipe.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the Composition?</p>
               <p>Smith. What is the Composition! I don't know;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174512040018"/> but he made Use of that Mould; there was an Impression to make a Shilling, after he cut off the Stem, and he fil'd it. And after that he inveigl'd me to go with him into the Country; and we went to Newcastle and Peterborough, and we went with about 5 l. of them. I carry'd the Money that Time, and he put it off; and he told me he design'd to go to Worcester and Bristol.</p>
               <p>Q. And you was at Basingstoke. Did you carry any of that Money with you?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes. I have seen him file 10 or 12 Pieces of that Counterfeit Matter, which had the Similitude of an English Shilling. He had Salt and Wax-Candle to rub it over with, to make it have a dull Hue; and he stroak'd it round with a File, to take off the rough Edge.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Basingstoke, did he give you Money?</p>
               <p>Smith. He was to meet me behind Montague-House, and I agreed to go as the Monday-Sen'night after. Some Time after he brings me a Horse at Five o'Clock in the Morning, and I went upon the Expedition, and he gave me a Box and a White Rug.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What he says I shall prove to be false. I shall say nothing yet.</p>

               <p>Rubby. Some in one Part and some in another: Some Pieces of Money lay upon a Ledge. We search'd the Fire-Place and found several Pieces of Metal. There was a Bed in the Room.</p>

               <p>Lister. He called once at my House at Tottenham-Court. He once kept the House that I now live in. Last Tottenham-Court-Fair was two Years, he call'd at my House to drink, and he gave me a bad Shilling; but I saw it, and told him of it, and he gave me a better.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. About the 5th of September I met Mr. Smith, and he ask'd me if I could tell him where he might put a Horse to Grass. I said there was Grass enough now, but I told him I did believe that the Man at the Royal-Oak at Vauxhall had Grass to let. My Lord, I and he drank together at the George in Tyburn Road; and I said I am now going to the Horse Ferry; and he fetched the Horse, and I put it for him to Grass at 12 s. a Month. As soon as I had done it and acquainted him with the Agreement, he said it was a great Price, and he would put it into another Place to Grass. I told him I did not care; but I did not see him for three Weeks; and when I saw him after, he was offering a Mare to sell. I looked up the Yard, and I said to the Man that was with me, stop a little, I shall speak to one here. And I went, and found that he was going to sell the Mare to one Mr. Taylor, a Gentleman of about 6 or 700 l. a Year. I said, your Servant Mr. Smith. Mr. Taylor said, do you know that Man? Yes, said I. Said he, I hope that he is an honest Man. Said I, as for Honesty, I can't give him a Character, for I don't understand how he should deal in Horses, seeing he has not wherewithal to carry on the Business. After this I asked Smith, when he would come and take his away? and sometime after this, he came one Day to my House, and left a Bag, and threw it down upon the End of the Counter. I went over the Way for a Pint of Beer: My Wife happen'd to tumble down the Bag, and these<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174512040019"/> Things, all of them, sell out of it; and she stoop'd down, and took up a Piece of Wood, a File, and three or four Pieces of Pewter. The Bag was thrown aside. He never came for the Bag, nor after the Things. I heard no more of him 'till he came to take me up.</p>

I went to the Bull to speak to a Gentleman's Coachman that was to be there; and light of another there in the Yard, and I ask'd him to go and drink. How much I did drink I can't tell. It was at Noon when I came into the Bull, and late at Night I went away, and the next Morning I found myself in the Counter. Next Morning I was hurry'd away to Guildhall, and then afterwards to Newgate. When I first went into the Bull I had 17 s. about me; and next Morning when I awak'd in the Counter, I had but one. Give me Leave; with Submission, if I might have Leave, I will give your Lordship an Account of the Pilgrimage of my Life and Conversation. When I came to the Bull I call'd for Liquor; what I call'd for, other People had.
