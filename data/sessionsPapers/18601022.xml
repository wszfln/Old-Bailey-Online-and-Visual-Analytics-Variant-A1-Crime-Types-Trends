                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, K</hi> 46). On the morning of 30th August, I went to Mr. Carpenter's shop, 68, Cannon-street-road, St. George's in-the East, a pawnbroker—I found a hole bored about the centre of the shop shutters—I put the middle finger of my right hand in as far it would go and it went nearly to the glass—there was a lamp about fifteen yards off I saw some sawdust on the pavement right under the hole in the shutters—I went away and saw Walker and Franklin; Franklin was in plain clothes—I put him in a doorway about an hundred yards down on the opposite side of the street to watch the premises—I sent Walker to the back of the premises and then went away to get other policemen—I examined the shop next morning and found a hole bored through-the shutters and the iron plate, which is about 1/15th of an inch thick—it went through a second iron plate, and I could get the second joint of my little finger through—the plate-glass window was broken—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a piece of it; the whole of one pane was broken—it was 2 ft. 11 in. by 2 ft. 8in.—I received this screw auger, such as is used by burglars, from Inspector Hayes.</p>

               <p>Sutherland, and saw the hole in the shutters—I stood in a doorway nearly opposite the shop for nearly half an hour—I saw Homewood, and two other men who are not in custody, come up to the corner of Chapman-streel; they stood there nearly half a minute—a constable in uniform on the be passed, and they went up Chapman-street and came back again with Kelly and Timothy, all five together—they stood under the lamp, and Homewood and the two not in custody went to Mr. Carpenter's shutters and commenced doing something—I cannot say what they did, but I heard glass fall-Timothy was then at the corner of Chapman-street, about five yards off them; Kelly about ten yards off, and the other three at the shutters—heard Timothy speak to the parties at the shutter, but could not hear what he said—I then went out of the doorway, and, as they had seen me previously, I staggered across the road as if I was drunk—I caught hold of Homewood by the back of the neck—he turned round directly, faced me and said, "Oh, is it you, you b—? give it to him, Bill," and struck me on the forehead with a life-preserver—I struck him with my rattle—I saw blow coming with a life-preserver, and it caught me on the knuckles—thi is the life-preserver (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw it knocked out of his hand; all the prisoners closed round me, and while I was struggling on the ground with Homewood, they were all trying to pull him away, and kicking me—I saw Homewood pass something to one of them but cannot say what—one of them said, "Give it to him, Bill, murder the b—"—I was struck there times with a life-preserver and my finger was broken—I said to Homewood "I know you, Skinner, you had better mind what you are about"—hit proper name is Skinner—he was secured and taken to the station by in and the other constable—I went in search of Kelly about half an hour afterwards and took him at a house in Bluegate-fields, about 400 yards off—I told him that he was wanted for a burglary about half an hour ago at Mr. Carpenter's—he said, "Very well"—I went next day after Timothy, to 22, Slater-street, Bethnal-green—I met him just as he was going in, and told him that I wanted him for a burglary at Mr. Carpenter's, and also for assaulting me—he said, "Very well," and asked if I had got; <hi rend="italic">Spuddy</hi>—I know <hi rend="italic">Spuddy</hi>, he is one who was engaged in this transaction and who has escaped.</p>

               <p>the shop and saw everything safe—I put up the shutters; there was no hole in them—I slept on the counter against the shop window—I heard a rum<lb/>bling during the night of the iron shutter—between the glass and the shutter there is a piece of iron to tit each pane—there were some chains hanging in the window, and I heard them shake together when the tool touched them, and heard the broken glass fall—the hole made was about the size of a halfpenny—I sprang out of bed, went up stairs, and called for assistance—I afterwards opened the shop door—I did not see the scuffle, but I heard somebody say "Hit him, B ill"—the glass was about three feet from me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sergeant of the detective force—in consequence of instructions watched Messrs. Besley's premises in August and September last—I know the prisoner Holly—I knew him as being in the employment of Messrs. Besley—I observed him on more than one occasion leave the premises of Messrs. Besley, and I followed him—on most occasions he went to No. 8, Union-stret t, Hoxton New Town, which is a marine-store dealer's shop, kept by the prisoner Florance—Holly generally left his employment about aquarter past 7 at night—he was dressed as he is now, in a rough blue coat, and cord trousers—on the evening of 25th September I was in Goswell-street with another officer, named Legg—about 20 minutes past 7 I saw Holly coming from the direction of Fann-street—he went to Florence's shop, which is, I should think, three-quarters of a mile from Messrs. Besley's—I followed him into the shop and there stopped him, and asked what he had got about him—he said he had nothing, at the same time I felt hit person, and found he had some hard substance round his body—Florence was behind the counter—I brought Holly to the shop-door, put my hand into his trousers pocket, and took out these two pieces of copper (<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—I handed him over to Legg—he said that that was the first thing he had overtaken—I told him I had watched him to that shop many times before—he made no reply—on the occasions when I have seen him enter Florence's shop I have watched him there various lengths of time—sometimes as long as an hour and a half—I am not aware where he was during that time; he always passed through the shop into the parlour—a partition divides the parlour from the shop, and there is a doorway through which he passed, and I lost sight of him; I could not see whether Florence accompanied him or not, or whether he was in the parlour—I subsequently took him to Moor-lane police-station—before that I searched the parlour into which I had always watched Holly go, and in that parlour I found nine pieces of metal with a quantity of other metal—it was on the floor, part under a chair, and the remainder under a bedstead, the chair being at the side of the bedstead—there was a bed in the parlour—there was a quantity of metal mixed, and oat of that I selected what I deemed expedient to take away—I produce it, and also some brass which I found in a shed—on my first going there Florence was behind the counter—I am not aware where he was when I found the property; he was not in the house, I inquired for him, but did not see him again that night—I remained there an hour and a half—after stopping Holly I went away for about two or three minutes, to get the assistance of another officer, and when I came back I did not see Florence—I made a further search in the back part of the premises, and in a shed at the back of the yard I found this parcel of brass, from which some pieces have been selected by some of the witnesses wrapped in two pieces of paper—I took possession of these nine ingots of metal, with the brass, and with other odd pieces of metal, and I left the premises with Holly—I did not see Florence any more that night—on the following Thursday morning, the 27th, about half-past 10, I went there again—I found Florence behind the counter—Legg was with me—I spoke to</p>

Besley—he said, "No; but they might I have formed part of 34 3/4 lbs. of brass," directing my attention to the entry under the date of 23d June, "Mr. Trout, Hoxton Old Town, 34 3/4 lbs. brass, "18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I do not find the name of Holly in the book—I have examined it—he was then charged with receiving this property—I have carefully examined the book, and cannot find any entries corresponding with this property.</p>

I am a printer, of St. Pancras—some time before 6th August I sold Mr. Whatmore some pieces of brass; it was eight to pica—I use it in my trade—I had it of Mr. Besley, or rather of the firm of Thorowgood; the name is Besley, but I do not know anything about Fox—the old name is Thorowgood; they are type-founders—I have had</p>

               <p>other business with them; founts, and any odd things I wanted for in trade.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you looked at the pieces of brass there to know what you are talking about; am I to understand you that you sold any por<lb/>tion of those to the last witness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say it is the same metal, but I sold some similar, and all cut up in bits like this, which is of no further use in our trade—I sold him none similar to this before 6th August—I have dealt with the firm of Thorowgood about thirty years—I have bought of them recently, but have not sold Whatmore any of that—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is what I bought yesterday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a metal dealer and gas fitter of 15, Crown<lb/>street, Soho—I have seen Florance two or three times—I do a large busi<lb/>ness in the metal trade—there is nothing unusual in the appearance of this hard ingot—it is not plumber's solder, it is a sort of fictitious metal which is sometimes brought to be sold for plumber's solder, it is lead and antimony—I can tell you better with my nail than by looking at it—here is another sort—these are the sorts of metal likely to be turned out of a general dealer's shop—I do not find the name of Besley and Fox on them—this is the usual style in which such things are sold to the trade—I have got in my stock, four tons of lead, and perhaps a ton of brass and a ton of copper—it is not an unusual thing for a smelter to go round to the small marine store shops—I never heard that it was necessary to take out a license for that—there is nothing unusual in these pieces of brass—we have a great quantity which we buy; they call it printers' lines, and when the edge is very sharp a printer tells me that it is of no value, or if it becomes notched—I have plenty of it by me.</p>

Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that these have ever been used at all, are they not the mere cuttings of the manufacturers, new pieces of cuttings? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should not think they were new, they do not appear like it to me—some appear to have been used by a printer, but they have laid by in a damp place and become black.</p>

                  </hi>. On Friday, 21st September, I went, with other officer, to Clerkenwell-green, about 7 o'clock in the evening—I saw John Cronin, he was coming in a direction from his own house, and about fifty yards from it an officer seized him, and he and I pushed him into the Crown public-house—he had his right hand in his pocket—I said, "Mr. Cronin, I need not tell you who I am, my name is Brannan; I have received instructions from the Mint to pay attention to you, for dealing largely in counterfeit coin"—he said, "I don't know what you mean"—I said, "What have you got in your hand?" he said, "Nothing"—we pulled his hand from his pocket, and in doing so, a paper parcel fell from his hand on the floor—I picked it up; I it contained a florin, a half-crown, and five chilling, all counterfeit, and wrapped in separate papers—I said to him, "Where do you live now, <hi rend="italic">Jack?</hi>" he said, "You know, Mr. Brannan, where you have been before"—I said, "Bit-alley" he said, "Yes"—I left him in charge of the officers and went to the house in Bit-alley—the street door was open and I proceeded to the first landing—the prisoners' room is on the left-hand side, at the top of the landing (I had been in that room before)—the room door was fast—I broke it open with a sledge-hammer, and found Margaret Cronin in the room, standing behind the door endeavouring to keep it shut—on entering I heard something rattle in an earthen pan of water that stood behind the door—I called Inspector Bryan's attention to it, and he looked and said, "Oh, Mr. Brannan, here is a lot of shillings"—I pushed Margaret Cronin away and her pockets were turned out—she became very violent—she was secured and I proceeded to the window, and found a galvanic battery in full play, containing seventeen shillings undergoing the process of electroplating; two shillings and thirteen sixpences which had not undergone any process, and a tile with white metal in the teeth of it, which had apparently been recently used—the galvanic battery was charged, and the contents of it I have here—Margaret Cronin was taken, but I was obliged to send to the station for more assistance or I do not know what might have been the consequence—I then returned to the public-house where I had left John Cronin—I told him I had been to his lodgings and found the woman and a large quantity of coin—he said, "Yes, Sir, it is a bad job."</p>

I am the wife of Edward Plummer, a linen-draper of Harwood-street, Kentish-town—on 12th September, the prisoner came to my shop for a pair of socks—she gave me in payment a good sovereign—I sent my daughter for change;—she brought back the change, a half-sovereign and 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I gave the prisoner the half-sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, and a farthing—she drew the change towards her and appeared to be counting it—I was about to give her a penny and she mid, "I will have a stay-hook for a penny"—my attention was drawn from the change to get a stay-hook—after I gave her the stay-hook it was laid on the counter—I got a piece of paper from under the counter, and wrapped it in paper, and that made her change right—when she gave me the sovereign, knowing that I had not change I said, "Can you accommodate me with smaller coin?"—she said, no she could not; but when she gave me the sovereign I saw there was some smaller coin in the purse which was wrapped in paper which fell on the counter—after I had given her the stay-hook she pushed the half-sovereign towards me and said would I oblige her with change; she said, "I should like silver for this"—I said I could not give her change, I should have to send out for change and trouble my neighbours again—while she had been waiting for change she had looked at some dresses, but did not decide on buying one—she still persisted in asking for change—I said, "If you will take the dress you have been looking at, I can give you change"—she said she could not take it that day but she would take it another day, and she said she wanted the silver as she wanted to buy some other little things—I then gave my little girl the half-sovereign—she went out and Mr. Kitchen came back with her and with the half-sovereign—Mr. Kitchen spoke to the prisoner, he said, "You have a great deal of impudence to come here after coining to my shop so recently; now I hat caught you"—she denied that Mr. Kitchen knew her; she said, "You don't know me"—he said, "Yes, I do, and two other persons know you as well as I do," and he sent for them—after that Mr. Kitchen put the half-sovereign to me; lie threw it down on the counter—the prisoner made a rush at it and got it from off the counter—Mr. Kitchen laid hold of her to prevent her keeping it; she struggled with him till he got her down—I saw her get her hand to her mouth, and after that she was quiet—she left off struggling and dropped a good half-sovereign in her lap—I never saw the half-sovereign that Mr. Kitchen brought back after that—the policeman picked up a bit of tissue paper on the floor and he found the half-sovereign and 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on her.</p>

               <p>—on 12th September, the little girl came to my shop for change for a bad half-sovereign—I went with her to Mrs. Plummer's, and on entering the shop I saw the prisoner—I recognised her directly and said, "Have you the impudence to come here, having so recently come in my shop?"—she said, "You don't know me"—I said, "I do, and you shan't get away this time"—I put the half-sovereign down on the counter and she seized it—I said, "She wants to swallow it;" and I seized her, for she was very violent, and I thought she would break the glass—I put her down; she struggled violently and put her mouth to her hand, and I heard something rattle against her teeth—she then ceased struggling and dropped a good half<lb/>sovereign in her lap—I said, "I don't want that, that is a good one; you have swallowed the other"—she said, "I must have a large swallow then"—she had come to my shop, I think, about five weeks before and had a bottle of capers—she tendered me a sovereign—I had to send out for change—when the boy came back with the change handed her the half-sovereign and the change—I had occasion to turn my back for a short time to unpack a case and she said, "Let me look at the sardines again"—she put the silver in her purse and put a half-sovereign to me and said, "Give me silver, I don't like this small money, I am afraid of losing it"—I took the half-sovereign to give her change and I felt it was light and a bad one—I said, "This is bad"—she said, "It is the one given to me"—I sent the boy back to Mr. Sherriff as she kept talking so much—Mr. Sherriff came and said it was a bad half-sovereign—the prisoner took the piece, and she said, "Give me a half-sovereign or I will go for a policeman;" she went out and never returned—I sent for Mr. Sherriff, and for another neighbour, Mr. Suter; they came to Mrs. Plummer's shop and saw the prisoner—I found a bit of tissue paper on the floor.</p>

I am one of the senior clerks in the General Post<lb/>Office—the prisoner was a letter-carrier there; he had to deliver letters on 12th October, in Rosamon-street walk, Clerkenwell—on that day I made up a letter, and I enclosed in it a half-sovereign, a two and a half American gold dollar piece, an American silver coin called a dime, and six postage stamps; I marked the whole of them before putting them into the enve<lb/>lope—I put some gum paper round the coins so as to prevent them from falling out—I placed them in an envelope addressed to Mrs. Green, 13, Lloyd's-row, Clerkenwell, London—I then gave the letter to Mr. Clare; he was acquainted with the object that I had in view—if posted according to my directions it would have reached the prisoner's hands for delivery about 12 o'clock—the place that I put as the address would be within his delivery—after he had finished his delivery it was his duty to return between 3 and 4 o'clock to the Post Office; he did so that afternoon—in consequence of information I received I sent for him about 4 o'clock that afternoon to my private room—Upfold the officer was with me—I asked the prisoner whether he made the 12 o'clock delivery on that day in the Rosamon-street walk—he said, "Yes"—I asked whether Lloyd's-row was in his delivery—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Well, a money letter, which should have been delivered by you with the 12 o'clock letters, addressed to Mrs. Green, 13, Lloyd's-row, is missing, do you know anything about it?"—he replied, "No, indeed; nothing at all"—I then directed Upfold to search him—I saw him take from his pocket 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver and about one shilling's worth of copper money—I then sent Upfold and Clare to Lloyd's-row, while I re<lb/>mained with the prisoner—on their return Mr. Clare showed me, in the prisoner's presence, this half-sovereign (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is the one I had inclosed in the letter; I find the same mark upon it, two figures of five on the shield, marked with a punch—I then asked the prisoner if he had changed a half-sovereign anywhere that day; he said, "No, I have not"—I then asked if he knew the Hope and Anchor public-house in Lloyd's-row—he said, "Yes, I did change a half-sovereign there to-day"—I then showed him the half-sovereign and said, "This half-sovereign the landlord, of the Hope and Anchor states you changed at his house about 1 o'clock to-day; it was enclosed in the letter which you ought to have delivered, addressed to Mrs. Green, where did you get it from?"—he replied, "The half-sovereign I changed at the Hope and Anchor I saved From my wages since last Satur<lb/>day"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220038"/>
               <p>—I then directed the officers to take the prisoner to Bow-street and charge him with stealing the letter addressed to Mrs. Green; the prisoner then observed, "Then you will be able to prove tomorrow that the half<lb/>sovereign was enclosed in the letter at 12 o'clock to-day?"—I said, "The gentleman who was in the room just now will be able to do so if necessary," meaning Mr. Clare—the prisoner remained silent for a few seconds, then tossed up his head and said, "Four years."</p>

I am inspector of letter-carriers at the General post<lb/>oflice—I was present when Mr. Gardner made up the letter on 12th October—I saw the money placed in the gum paper, and the in the letter—I looked at the money before it was placed in the letter—I saw the marks which Mr. Gardner put on the money—this is the half-sovereign, I see here the marks that I observed when Mr. Gardner placed the money in the letter—I posted the letter at the chief office about twenty minutes past 11 in the day—I had given information to Mr. John Swain, an inspector in the office, that such a letter would be posted—I was in the office when the prisoner was making up his letters for delivery, and I saw him lean over his seat in this way, feeling his letters as if to see if there was coin in them; he had a memorandum book near him, and I saw him turn round and place I a letter in this little blue-covered book—he then put the book in his pocket and left the room—he returned to his desk in two or three minutes where lie was setting up his letters; he placed himself in the same position again, leaning over his seat—he soon afterwards left the office to deliver his letter in the Rosamon-street walk; he returned to the post-office about 4 o'clock—I afterwards went with the constable Upfold to the Hope and Anchor; I the landlord took four half-sovereigns out of his pocket; from those four half-sovereigns I identified this one—it is the one I saw in the morning I placed in the letter—I returned with it to the Post-office, where The Prisoner I was remaining with Mr. Gardner.</p>

I am inspector of letter-carriers—On 12th October, between 11 and 12 o'clock, I took out of the box a letter addressed to "Mrs. Green, Lloyd's-row"—I noticed that letter very particularly—on that morning I placed that letter among others before the prisoner for his delivery—the letters are not always counted, they are sometimes, not as a rule—they were not counted in this instance—they are counted by the stampers—I placed the letters before him; and, among others, I put the one addressed to Mrs. Green—that was when he was absent, before he came to set them up—I noticed the letter; it was in my possession some time before—I am quite sure that letter was on the table when ho came to set them up—I am quite I sure it came into his possession at About 12 o'clock—he left the office about twenty minutes past 12, or, perhaps, before that.</p>

I live in the Old-road, Enfield, with my mother—it is my house—on Sunday night, 30th October, I went to bed about 10 o'clock—I looked round and everything was fast—I sleep on the ground floor and my mother up stairs—in the middle of the night I was awoke about 3 o'clock—I heard a noise at the foot of my bed; some one trampling about—I said, "Mother, is that you?"—no one answered me, and I thought it was the cat—I laid a little longer—I afterwards got up, and found the middle door and the back door open—I missed several articles—my work-box was lying close to the door, and there was a place open where the tiles had been taken off—the tiles come low down—the place would admit a youth through—I went up stairs, and missed two coats, two pairs of trousers, two waist<lb/>coats, and other things out of a box—a handkerchief, a shirt, and a pair of braces were gone—part of them were mine and part were Mr. Patten's—I saw them safe on Sunday morning, about 9 o'clock; the box was then closed but not locked—part of these are my son's—this is his shirt, trousers, and other things; they are all mine except this waistcoat and shirt—this is my work-box; it was left in the garden—it had been opened—there was nothing of value in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor residing in Victoria-park square—I knew Mrs. Mary Emsley, who lived at 9, Grove-road—she was a client of mine, and had been so for some years prior to her death—she was pos<lb/>sessed of considerable house property in that neighbourhood—she collected a great part of her rents herself from weekly tenants—she lived alone, without any servant—I know a person of the name of Walter Emm—he occasionally assisted her in the collection of rents—On Friday, 17th August, Emm called on me and made a communication to me—I did not go with him, but sent him, and appointed to meet him at the house in Grove-road—I met Dillon there—the door of the house was fastened when we got there—we knocked at the front door and there was no admittance to be gained—I then desired the constable to get over the garden wall at the back—he did so, and said the door was open, and I went over the wall and followed him in the same way—we went through the house—we found no person on the ground floor—the door of the parlour was open, and the back window appeared to be a little open—there is a front and back parlour; they open from the one to the other, and form one room—we then went up on to the first floor—the door of the front bedroom on the first floor was open—that was the room used by the deceased as her bedroom—there is a small back room as well with lumber in it—the bed appeared not to have been slept in—we then went up stairs to the second floor—the door of the front room was open, and I there saw the body of Mrs. Emsley, with her head towards the land<lb/>ing, near the doorway—the body was lying so much in the doorway as to prevent the door from closing—you could scarcely enter the room without treading over the body—there was a bundle of papers for papering rooms in front of her, and two pieces of paper under her arm—Dr. Gill was then sent for at my request; he came almost immediately—the deceased remained in the position in which she was lying until the doctor came, at my request, she was not disturbed in any way—when I was there that day I noticed this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a remarkable one—I saw it in the bedroom of the deceased, on the first floor—that is the room underneath that in which she was found dead—the key was on the table—there was a table in the bed-room next to the window, and I am not sure whether it was not in a basket, I think it was—there was some biscuit in the basket, and I think some other keys, but I noticed that key particularly on account of the bow being remarkable.</p>

On Friday, 17th August, I was called by a man, of the name of Emm, to No. 9, Grove-road—I went there and found Mr. Rose, Mr. Faith, Mr. Whitaker, and Mr. Biggs, waiting out<lb/>side the house—I gained admittance at the next door, and passed over the back wall to the back yard of the deceased's house-I found the back door shut, on the latch—the front door was shut on the spring-lock, but not double-locked; it would double-lock—there were no bolts drawn—a person going out and pulling the front door after him would leave it securely latched—I next went into the back parlour, and saw the back window raised up four or five inches—the shutters were closed but not fastened; not bolted—I saw the front parlour window shutters down and the curtains drawn back—I went into the front parlour; the curtains were drawn back and the shutters open; the window was fastened by a catch above—I next proceeded to the first floor front room—I saw a bed there which did not appear to have been slept in recently; the bed was not made-the right hand window-blind in the room was drawn down and the left drawn up-I then went into the back room on the same floor, which was filled with lumber and a quantity of paper hangings—I then went up stairs, and saw the deceased lying dead in the front room—that was on the floor above the front bed-room—the left hand window in the room was raised up a few inches, the right hand window was down—the deceased was lying on her left side, with her head against the door-post; her face was towards the boards, downwards, on the left side—there were a quantity of paper-hangings in that room and a quantity behind the deceased's back; there were several pieces near her head—I noticed the floor of the landing outside, and observed a footprint in the blood—I was not present when the piece of board was cut out—Dr. Gill was then sent for—I remained there till he came—everything was left in the same state as I have described it until Dr. Gill made his appearance—from the direction of the footprint the foot would be coming from the room—I examined all the bolts of the doors and shutters in the house—I disco<lb/>vered no marks whatever of any violent entry having been made—I afterwards made a search of the rooms below, and found a gold mourning ring between the bed-tick and mattress—the ring is in Court; my inspector has it—I found that in the first-floor, in the bed room; it bore the inscription of Samuel Emsley, Esq.—I also saw three half-pence in coppers on a chair—I gave the ring to Inspector Kerrison—I remained on the premises till I was relieved—the garden of the house is surrounded by walls—the gardens of the houses at the back of the houses in Grove-road abut on the garden of the house of the deceased on either side—there is no road between—the houses in Grove-street are at the back of the Grove-road houses—the back door of No. 9 has a glass window in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Edinburgh College of Physicians, and a surgeon of London—I was called in to see the deceased—I found her lying at full length on her left side, with the face turned a little more to the left, towards the boards—she was dressed—there was no sign of her having made any preparation for going to bed—the first wound which presented itself to my notice was a large opening in the back of the skull, extending deeply into the brain—I think that was the result of repeated blows—that wound alone was quite sufficient to account for death—there were a great number of minute portions of the skull carried completely within the brain and packed under the other portion of the skull, into the interior of the substance of the brain, and deposited within the upper portion of the skull—the posterior portion of the cerebrum would be immediately exposed to that injury, the posterior portion of the big brain, and of the little brain also, the opening was so large—there were several other wounds which would have caused death besides that one—the wound over the left ear would have caused death—it was a contused wound, and the whole of the temporal bone on that side was driven in; that also being in small fragments—there was also a blow above the other ear, that was a contused wound—there was no wound in the scalp on that side, but there had evidently been a heavy blow on that side—there was also what we should almost term a lacerated wound above the left eyebrow, and another, wound in the left ear, also a lacerated wound—before I saw this hammer (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) I had formed an opinion as to the character of the instrument with which these blows were inflicted—the wound, which was the result of repeated blows, might have been inflicted with the blunt side of this hammer—I had an opportunity of seeing whether the hammer fitted the wound on the eyebrow; the blade, of the hammer corresponded with the length of that wound—I consider it was. such a wound as might have been inflicted by the thin end of that hammer—I noticed a quantity of blood; there was a pool on the floor which had flowed from the body, from one point, passing away from her into the room from the doorway—from the place where the head was, the room was. inclined—I noticed a mark of blood on the under part of her petticoat, but, of course, external, as the petticoat was drawn upwards over the head—it was a superficial smear—it appeared to me as if something had been wiped on it</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Could you form any opinion from the appearance of the wounds which wound was inflicted first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be a mere, matter of opinion, but I should rather think that the wound on the temple had been inflicted first; that appeared to have been one blow—the body was slightly decomposed when I saw it—the face was very slightly decom<lb/>posed—I don't think the incised wound on the eyebrow was as. much decom<lb/>posed as the opposite side of the face—there were indications of decomposi<lb/>tion going on, certainly—the effect of decomposition, under some circum<lb/>stances, would be to cause a wound to expand, to gape—I don't consider that it was at all distended from decomposition, because it was comparatively dry—in this case the wound would gape slightly, certainly—I forget how long after my first examination this hammer was shown to me; I should think a week, perhaps more—I have not the slightest recollection; it might have been a fortnight; I don't bear it in mind—I did not compare the hammer with the body—I measured the wound over the eyebrow, and probed the depth of it with my finger—I form my opinion as to the in<lb/>strument which inflicted the wounds from the appearance of the wounds and from being accustomed to see wounds inflicted by all sorts of instruments—a piece of iron, an iron bar, sharp at the end, would, undoubtedly produce</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220054"/>
               <p>such wounds as these—I should think it possible, certainly, that the wounds at the back of the head might have been done with a larger instrument than this—I considered they could have been done with a hammer—the wound at the back of the head was considerably greater than this part of the hammer; it was some inches in size—I should imagine that whatever instrument was used there would be a considerable quantity of blood on it.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at 16, Grove-road, immediately opposite No. 9, where Mrs. Emsley used to live—I have lived there twelve years—I last saw her alive on Monday evening, August 13th, between 7 and 8 o'clock, sitting at her first-floor window—she usually went to bed about 10, or even before, I have seen her, but usually about 10—the shutters of her house were always closed by dusk—I never saw them open after dusk—I noticed her house about 12 o'clock on the night of 13th August—the shutters were open—my attention was attracted by it; I thought it remarkable—I observed the house early the next morning, about daybreak; it was not quite light—the shutters were not closed—the blinds were just the same as they were on the Monday—the first floor blind was down—the window even with it was up rather more than half-way—one blind was pulled down and the other blind was rather more than half-way up—there were no blinds on the second floor—one of the windows of the second floor was slightly open—I saw a person on the Wednesday knock at the door three times—I observed other persons knocking, but I do Dot know which days they were—when persons knocked at the door of the deceased she would open the first-floor window, where she usually sat, and look out and speak to them from the window—she would sometimes speak to them from the area, which is grated over—there was no access into the house by the area—she would only let those persons in who were in the habit of going there, or who worked then—if she knew them she would come down or answer them from the window, but she always looked out from the window first</p>

               <p>the accusation in substance, that Mullins had made—we did not tell him that Mullins had made it—I then went, by the direction' of Inspector Thornton, to Emm's house and searched it—I spoke to Mrs. Emm—Emm was not there then, he was left with Mr. Thornton—we looked in the shed and at that time found nothing—we then went back to Mr. Thornton to report the result of our mission, and at that period Mullins appeared in the field, within fifty yards of us—I found Thornton and Emm had advanced to the ruined cottage; they were standing in front of it—at the time I saw Mullins in the field I went to him, and on my approach he said, "You have not half searched the place, she (meaning, I suppose, Mm. Emm) had her back to you all the while; come, I will show you where I think it is put"—I said, "No, not now; we don't want Emm to know you are the informant," and in the conversation we walked round between a stack of bricks and another old shed which is in the field—we halted four or five yards in front of the identical shed which he alluded to as where he saw Emm put the parcel, and he said, "There, look now, go and pull down that b—slab and turn up those bricks"—I looked at him and retired with him from the spot—I did not go towards the shed—I came back some twenty yards—I spoke to Sergeant Thomas and desired him to go and pull down the stone, at the same time telling Mullins to go to the Rising Sail and wait for me—Thomas went to the stone and returned to where Thornton, Emm, and I were—Thornton and Emm were still in front of the ruin—I saw Thomas pull the stone on one side, and saw him bring out the parcel—the slab is shown on the plan, we had simply to pull the stone forward and take it out; anyone could have placed it there without going into the shed—the parcel was opened in the presence of Emm—I cannot speak to its condition so well as Thomas; he handled it and undid it—I did not handle it in its original state—I saw it opened and saw what it contained—this is the outer paper; it was tied round the same as it is now, with this piece of tape—it is a piece of tape which might form an apron string or anything of that sort; besides that there was an inner parcel—this is it, it was tied as it is now, with a piece of shoemaker's waxed string—it contained some pieces of newspaper, some blotting paper, one metal table spoon, and three metal tea spoons, and these two lenses or magnifying glasses; two of the spoons are lettered "W. P."—besides these there was a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Bank of London—this is it—that cheque is described in the handbill as a cheque drawn by Pickering and Carrier on the Bank of London, dated August 14th, 1860—those were all the contents of the parcel—I was then directed to fetch Mullins back from the public-house, which I did, leaving Thornton, Thomas, and Emm still in front of the ruined shed—Mullins came back and stood in front of an old waggon that was there—he said, "Have you found anything?"—he appeared delighted, rubbed his hands, and laughed, and said, "Have you found any b—money?"—I said; "Thomas has found something, I cannot tell you what; Emm is very ill"—he appeared to laugh, rubbed his hands and said, "Oh, of course he would be"—I was then told to take him to the station in Arbour-square, which I did—Emm was also taken—he was there charged and Mullins also—he was charged by Inspector Thornton, in my presence, the charge was taken down in writing—the charge sheet is not here—it would be at Scotland-yard now—upon being charged, Mullins said, "Is this the way I am to be served, after giving information?"—I searched him—I found that his shoe was tied with a piece of waxed string—I have it here; it is waxed with cobbler's wax—the string round the parcel is waxed with cobbler's wax—I</p>

CLERK</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he telling Thornton in the cab what he had seen Emm do? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Thornton and the prisoner were in conversation, but I did not bear all they said—When we got to the brick-field we went into the brick-field—I went to the shed that had been spoken of, adjoining the house—I looked into the shed, but did not disturb anything; I merely looked into it—after that I went into the house and searched there; I saw some papers relating to some property between the deceased and Emm—I then returned to Inspec<lb/>tor Thornton, and at that time Mullins made his appearance in the field—I had taken him up Bonner's-lane, out of sight of Emm's place altogether, and said, "Mullins, remain here till we send for you"—that was about 150 yards from the place where I next saw him—he had some conversation with Tanner in the field—I did not hear what passed—Tanner then spoke to me, and from what he said I went again to the shed, and removed a flagstone that was just inside the door, and there I found a parcel, tied round with tape—it was behind the stone, between the stone and the wall—at the bottom there were some bricks and rubbish—the stone was buried about three or four inches outside and inside—the parcel was on the top of the bricks, be<lb/>tween the wall and the stone—the bricks were not visible from outside, in the field, until I had removed the stone, not what was behind the stone, not in the middle, where the parcel was—the stone was two inches from the wall at the bottom part—it was standing nearly against the wall, it leant towards the wall—the brick rubbish was between the bottom of the stone and the wall—the brick rubbish was not visible when I was outside in the field—when I took the parcel I brought it to where Thornton was standing in the field—I spoked to Emm first, before I untied the parcel—Mullins was not near enough to hear what was said—I opened the parcel in Tanner's presence—it contained some spoons, a cheque for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and two lenses—I afterwards went to 33, Barnsley-street, I went to the back room on the ground floor in that house—I had been in that room before—the prisoner lived there; I had seen him there—I there found a small bit of shoemaker's wax and a small bit of twine, together on the mantel-piece—I produce them—the street door of the house opens by a small bit of twine; anybody can open it from the outside—the door of the prisoner's room was locked—I had not the key with me; I broke it open—I afterwards went to the house, 17, Oakum-street, from which I had seen the prisoner come—a person named Kelly is the landlady of that house—I went into a back room there where I found the prisoner's wife, and in that room I found a spoon, which I produce, it has on the back of it the letters W.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> That is the ordinary trade mark, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe so—I believe it is the maker's mark—the spoons are ordinary sort of German metal spoons, generally in use—there is a slight difference be<lb/>tween the appearance of the spoon found at the prisoner's house, and the spoons found in the parcel—I should say the one found in the house was worn more than those found in the parcel—two of those in the parcel are alike, and one of those in the parcel and the one found in the house are just the same pattern—when I come to look at the bowls they are a different</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the detective police—On Saturday, 8th September, the prisoner called at my house—on the following morning I went with Tanner, Thomas, and the prisoner, to Bethnal-green—as we went along, the prisoner said he had been watching Emm, who had been living in Mr. Emsley's brick-field, Bethnal-green, for some time, and on Saturday, about half-past 8 in the morning, he saw him come out of his house, go to a ruin or shed, about fifty yards from his house, bring out a parcel, and, looking about him, go into his own house, that he was there a few minutes, then came out with a smaller parcel, and went to a shed or lean-to adjoining his own house, and was there about a minute, and then came out without the parcel—he said the parcel that he fetched from his own house was a small parcel about the size of a pint pot—I went to that brick-field—directions were given to Thomas to search in the shed and the house—the parcel was afterwards brought to me—Emm was not in good health at that time; he seemed to be labouring from illness, and suffering—I-had given instructions to Mullins as to where he was to remain—I told him to remain outside the brick-field, and if we wanted him we would send for him—I saw him in the brick-field at the extreme or north<lb/>east end of the brick-field shortly after—some ten minutes afterwards he came up to within twenty-five yards of where I was standing, and I sent Tanner to take him away—I saw the parcel opened, and the contents have been produced here—I afterwards went to the house in Barnsley-street, and found this plasterer's hammer, which has been produced—I found it lying with other tools, I believe, on the floor in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Connaught-row, Bethnal-green. I was well acquainted with Mrs. Mary Emsley during the last four years, I think this is the fourth summer—I knew her husband before, from about the year 1820—I was in the habit of calling upon her in general once a week, since she lived in Grove-road—I used to call there on Sunday evening mostly—I called there on Sunday, 12th August, the day before this calamitous affair—I was to have gone there on the Tuesday to see Mr. Cook, he being an acquaintance of mine—I did not go at the time appointed; instead of going at 11, it was about half-past 1—I could not get in—I have seen some plate which the deceased deposited with me; I did not see it from the time of her depositing it with me, until the time she wanted to take something out of it, I had not any farther knowledge of it—I kept it secured as she tied it up—she took back some of that; a few articles to sell, such as a silver snuff-box, a lady's pencil-case, and a silver watch, and gold pins with coloured stones—she took away a silver pencil-case with her about four months ago, I think, somewhere early in the summer; I cannot call to mind the time exactly; it was about four months, it might have been more or less—I did not see that pencil-case afterwards until I saw it at the police court, or rather until Tanner showed it to me—I believe that this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) was the pencil-case which she took away with her, and for this reason; when she took it out of the parcel, (indeed I did not know it was there before,) she said "Here is a pencil-case, seeming to say, "Would you like to have it?"—that was how I understood her—I took hold of it and said, "Oh, it is an old-fashioned concern"—the point was thin, very much bent, more so than it is now—that has been put in order—I said I did not think I should—"I don't think it is of much use, it appears to be very much broke"—she said, "I don't suppose it is;" and consequently took it back again with her—I observed the head of the pencil-case at the time; it was a round head like this; I believe this to be the very pencil-case—I saw some lenses of a telescope in her possession, something like four weeks before her decease, when she gave them to me to look at, saying, "Here are two</p>

I am a shoemaker by trade—I reside at a little cottage in Emsley's brick-field, Globe-town, Bethnal-green—I know the pri<lb/>soner—I have know him from, I think, about the beginning of last February—he has visited at my house—he has had meals there—he has had tea three or four times at the house in the brick-field, and I think he has had meat and bread too there, after dinner when he has called in—I think it was about four weeks before 13th August, the day of the murder, that he had been at my cottage, but I saw him in Barnsley-street two days in that week—I had to fetch him on the Thursday before the 13th August for the old lady, to move a slab-stone in one of the houses in Barnsley-street, in the back yard—I saw him on the Friday before the murder, in the afternoon—I was fre<lb/>quently in the habit of seeing him—he worked for me—he worked for Mrs. Emsley, and I had to see him—I was employed by Mrs. Emsley to collect her rents, and I took jobs from her—I remember Thornton, and Thomas, and Tanner coming to me at the brick-field—that was on Sunday, 9th Septem<lb/>ber, I think—I was then taken in custody—I did not know what the charge was—I was charged with having a parcel there belonging to Mrs. Emsley.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We have heard that a parcel was found by Serjeaut Thomas, behind a slab in an out-house of your cottage; did you put it there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had not anything whatever to do with that parcel—I had never seen that parcel before it was produced in my presence by Thomas—I was aware that a re<lb/>ward had been offered—I saw the old lady on the afternoon of Monday, 13th August, about 2 o'clock, at the end of Barnsley-street—that was the last time I saw her alive—after I left Mrs. Emsley on Monday, 13th August, I went into one of the houses to see a plumber, and from there I went home—I got home about half-past 3—I then stopped at home till 6 o'clock, or a little after 6; then I went with Mr. Rowland to Bethnal-green workhouse—I stopped there for some time, till Rowland, and my wife, and a Mrs. Buckle came out—I then went on to the field again with them—I wanted Rowland to drive me to Stratford—I was on the field some length of time—I could not catch the pony to get it harnessed; that took me some time—then I went to Mr. Rumble, the owner of the pony, to see if he would come and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220065"/>
               <p>catch it, and when I came back again Rowland and my wife, and some one else, had caught the pony—I started about 9 o'clock to go to Bromley and Stratford—it might be two or three minutes past 9, I am not exactly confi<lb/>dent what time exactly it was—I think I got home to Globe-town about half-past 11 o'clock—my wife went with me to Stratford, and a woman of the name of Buckle; and Rumble, the owner of the pony, drove me there—we were the four that went—I have a toll-ticket that I had on that day; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the date is the 13th of the 8th month.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the solemn oath that you have taken to tell the truth, had you anything to do with the murder of this old lady? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No I had not—I re<lb/>member the day I was taken into custody, when the parcel was found—on the previous day, Saturday, I think it was about half-past 9 when I got up—I was not well that day, or I should have been up before—I went out of the cottage that day, I think, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 10—I had not left the cottage before that at all—ray daughter was in the cottage that morning—she works for me—she binds, and works on the seat—my wife was in the cottage that morning—I know a shed about 40 or 50 yards from my cottage—I did not go there that morning—I did not put any parcel there—I did not go into the shed that morning by the side of my cottage—I only went to the shed on the right side—that is a-water-closet—I went there—I returned in two or three minutes—I then remained in the house working till my dinner was ready—I was not outside any more—I collected rents for the old lady, at Stratford—that was my business that night—I went there by Mrs. Emsley's orders at 2 o'clock that day when I saw her, because I did not send my boy on Saturday—it was one house I went to, to receive 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not receive the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went for that purpose—I did not call at Mrs. Emsley's house after that till the following Wednesday, 15th August—I called for her to go with me to Stratford—I found no admittance to the house—after<lb/>wards, in consequence of what I had heard, I acquainted Mr. Rose, at his private house, at 8 o'clock on the following Friday morning, that I could not obtain admission to the house.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How often did you go on the Wednesday to this house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On Wednesday, the 15th, I went in the afternoon, and then, as I came home from Stratford, at half-past 9 in the evening—I knocked in the afternoon; there was no answer—I knocked again at night at half-past 9—I did not stop there, because it was raining—I sent my wife on the Thursday morning—I went on Thursday evening myself—I knocked again; there was no answer—Mr. Whitaker, a relative of Mrs. Emsley's, lives close by there, across in the Bow-road—I can't say that I thought there was something the matter with the old lady; when I knocked twice on the Wednesday—on the Thursday night I should say I did—I did not go and tell any one then that I could not get in—I spoke to the next-door neighbour, at No. 8, who came home while I was standing there—I said, "Have you seen Mrs. Emsley to-day?"—he said, "No, I have been out all day"—he looked at my wife and said, "Why, you were here this morning"—my wife had told me she had knocked in the morning—I said, "I have been knocking now for some time; it is very strange; I was knocking here at half-past 9 last night"—he said, "Oh! then she came home late"—with that I turned to my wife and said, "Well, we had better let this be; we will call one of the youngsters up in the morning, and send them to the house, and see whether we find the house in the same position as it is now; if we find the house in the same position then I will let all that I know who know Mrs. Emsley know of it"—for that reason I called the girl up at 6 o'clock, and sent her to the house—she came home</p>

               <p>again to me, and I got my breakfast, and then I called on Mr. Rose, and told him all that had gone on—I then recollected that the boy could not get admittance on the Tuesday, and I told Mr. Rose of it—from there I sent one of the children to Mr. Biggs, and I went to Brook-street, Ratcliff, to a Mr. Churchley, thinking he might have seen Mrs. Emsley—I did not know that the old lady was subject to fits, and that she had a swimming in the head about three or four weeks previous to her being murdered—I don't think I have said that I thought she was in a fit when I called on the Wednesday—I am sure I did not say so—I could not have said such a thing as that—if I had thought that, I could have got a ladder and got into the house—I did not allege, as a reason for not telling her relatives, that I thought she was in a fit—I am sure of that—I was in the habit of going sometimes three times a week to Stratford to collect those rents, Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday—I used to take the old lady the rents as soon as I got back—I never went on a Wednesday but what I did receive some rents—on Mondays and Satur<lb/>days I did not have to call at her house—I dare say that this was the only occasion within the last month or so that I went down in a vehicle to collect these rents, but I have often been to Stratford in a vehicle—I don't know that I received tickets from the turnpike-keeper always—sometimes the driver of the cart did—it has not always been the same that drove me—when I have received them I have not taken any notice whether I have kept them, for I did not think they would be of any use to me—I found this one in my pocket—I did not think it would be any use to me—I found it in my waist<lb/>coat pocket—you are obliged to have them, because you go through two or three bars, and are obliged to sing out the number—I can't say whether I wore that waistcoat from that time up to the time I found the ticket; some<lb/>times I put on one and sometimes another—I have got, perhaps, half-a-dozen waistcoats or more—I put on one, a thick waistcoat suitable for a chilly night, and a thin oue if it is warm—I asked the carman if he had this ticket and I felt in my pockets to see if I had got it, and I found it in one of my pockets—I can't say when—it was after my apprehension that I found it; after I was locked up—this was not the first time I have ever said any<lb/>thing about this ticket—I took it, I think, the first week after I was liberated—I took it to Mr. Wontner—Mr. Wontner told me to take care of it—I did not produce it before the magistrate; it was never asked for—I had it there ready if asked for—Mr. Wontner had it, and he gave it me back again, and told me to take care of it—Rowland was the name of one of the persons with me that evening—he was with me up to about 9 o'clock, but Rumble, Buckle, and my wife were the parties that went with me to Strat<lb/>ford—I cannot tell you when I first saw Rowland after that, for I often saw him—I saw him shortly after I was released, but he told the officers, and told Mr. Young, the same day I was locked up, before I was released, that Rumble and Buckle were with me—he knew it the day before I was dis<lb/>charged—it was not told in my presence—I was locked up when Rowland had got Rumble and Buckle to prove that I was there—they had not been ex<lb/>amined then—I was not well when I saw Mullins on the Friday previous to the murder—that was a month before I was taken—I had been on and off in an ill state, the whole of that time—I had not been lying in bed till half-past 9 each morning from the time I saw Mullins first till I was taken, but in between I had—I have not been up as early as 5 o'clock—I am confident of that—I got up as early as 8 o'clock within a day or two of my being taken in custody, not earlier than 8 I am quite sure; never on any occasion that I now think of, I don't think I have been up before 8, I know that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220067"/>
               <p>I have not; it is above thinking, I know I was not up before 8—there was nothing for me to look after on the field; for that reason I should not have to get up—I carry on the trade of a shoemaker.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Holly-bush-gardens, Bethnal-green-road—I remember going with Emm on a Monday down to Stratford—I had been at the workhouse that day with Mrs. Emm—Mrs. Emm and I went first—Mr. Rowland came while we were there—I do not know exactly what day of the month it was; it was the 13th August I suppose; the day it was expected that the old lady was murdered—it was, as near as I can say, about half-past 6 o'clock that day, that I saw Rowland—Walter Emm was waiting outside the Union when we came out—I saw him there—I afterwards went down in a cart to Stratford with Emm and his wife—Rumble drove us—when we got back to Mr. English's it was nearly half-past 11—he lives in Park-street, Bethnal-green—Emm was with us all that time—we stopped at Mr. English's about five minutes.</p>

"Mr. Emm, I heard you were taken up for Mrs. Emsley"—he said, "Yes;" he was out on bail—he said, "Do you remember Monday, 13th August, I was with you at Stratford?"—I did not say anything about it—I have been at Stratford since, but never before—I went on the Tuesday after this, along with Mrs. Emm—Mr. Rowland was not with me either time—he was not with me on the Monday, only when he was in with us at the workhouse—I, Mr. and Mrs. Emm, and Mr. Rumble went to Stratford—on the Tuesday I, and Mr. and Mrs. Emm, and Mr. Rowland went, not Mr. Rumble; I think it was Mr. Rowland—I am quite sure it was Rowland—we walked down there on the Tuesday; we did not go in any vehicle.</p>

"I said, "No, I have not, "and the party said," I hope it is not Mrs. Emsley"—I noticed Mullins at that time—I noticed a tremor come over him, and a slight alteration of the features—I then went on with him to Gaffney's and finished his job—I found his work was done in a very strange manner, the paper was all turned upside down, and his mode of doing things was more like a person that was imbe<lb/>cile than anything else—after finishing what I agreed to do for him I left, and just afterwards I heard it confirmed that it was Mrs. Emsley that was murdered—I then went back to the cooper's where he was at work, called him out, and said, "Mullins, I want to speak to you; it is Mrs. Emsley that is murdered"—I then saw a very remarkable change in the man—he said, "Is it? come outside," in a nervous irritable way—he seemed excited, very much indeed—he said, "Come, and have some drink"—there was a public house about two doors off, and he said, "Let us have some rum, you like rum"—I do not like rum particularly, however, I did have some with him, and then I noticed that his appearance indicated something very extraordi<lb/>nary; he was pale, and he shook and trembled, which gave me a notion at the time that there was something very wrong about him—I next saw him on Wednesday, 5th September, previous to the apprehension of Emm on the Sunday—I met him about half-past 8 o'clock in the evening—I said to him, "Mullins, they have not found out the murderer of Mrs. Emsley; have you heard anything of the murder of Mrs. Emsley?"—he said, "No; "Nor have I, "I said—he said he was going to get something for his supper—I said, "I am going round here; "he said, "I will walk with you"—we went into a house to see a person, but did not see him—when we came out the prisoner said, "Let us have some spirits, I want some spirits, "and we did have a small drop of gin—I then went out of the house with him and I said, "Mullins, I suspect a man very strongly, and I have got him in my mind's eye now, and I will not lose sight of him till the perpetrator of this diabolical murder has been discovered"—he then assumed a very ghastly appearance; a pallor came over him, a death-like hue, and he said, "I suspect the man likewise, and I am watching him now"—I said, "I be<lb/>lieve, Mullins, the man I suspect is not the man you suspect"—he then wanted to leave me, although he had said he was going my way—I said, "I thought you were going to get something for your supper?"—he said, "No, I shall not have any supper now"—then I put another question to him respecting the removal of the paper at Mrs. Emsley's house, which had been deposited in the parlour and which was taken up into the second</p>

Q.</hi> Mulling is a plasterer by trade is he not, not a paper<lb/>hanger? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I don't know exactly what he is; he was represented to me to be a plasterer, and I believe he is—it is not difficult-to put up paper<lb/>hangings—as a business it is nothing, you may learn it in about six months—I don't believe Mullins is a paper-hanger; not a tradesman—I have had several conversations with him about this poor old lady—I know he was in the habit of going to her place, and working for her—I was also in the habit of being employed by her—I was sorry to hear of her death, because I lose something by it; I felt grieved that a woman should be murdered in that way, and so would any man with any feeling—I did not see the prisoner from the 13th till the 15th—I saw him once or twice afterwards—I had no other conversation with him after the 5th September, that was the last; that was after the murder had been found out—the other conversation was before it was discovered—I saw him about the neighbourhood several times during that period—it was not because the carpenters had not finished their work that he did not finish the job, there were no carpenters em<lb/>ployed—there was some patch-work to finish to the ceilings in some small houses, which was work that required to be done directly, as it puts them to inconvenience, and I expected him to do it—the old paper had not to be taken off, not as far as he was concerned.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember what sort of a hat he wore generally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, sometimes a hat and sometimes a peaked cap—when I saw him about 2 o'clock on the Monday I believe he had his hat or cap on; I really cannot tell now—I never saw him wear a <hi rend="italic">billy-cock</hi> hat—I have never given any information against a man named Smith about this murder—I spoke before the Coroner of the man having some quarrel with Mrs. Emsley—that was before I know anything about this charge, it was after she was found murdered—I did not give information about Smith, I merely said that he had had a quarrel with Mrs. Emsley and the matter was referred to me—she said to me, "This man wants to rob me, Mr. Rowland, of a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note"—I said, "No, I don't think he does"—she had detained his rent-book and he was trying to get it and seized her basket—he was a tenant of Mrs. Emsley—I know him, he is a lame man and walks with a crutch—I settled the matter between them amicably, I found that Mrs. Emsley was wrong and the tenant was right; but she made use of an exclamation, "This man</p>

               <p>wants to rob me of a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and I have got it here"—I did not tell the Coroner I had important evidence to give—I said I had evidence to give respecting the customs and habits of the late Mrs. Emsley—I was not examined then; I think not till the third time.</p>

I am not sure which—I was only there for a short time—the slab that I was removing, was in the back kitchen, by the side of the fire-place; there was a hole by the side of the fender—Mr. Gibson's is a large house.</p>

METCALFE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your wife had known Mrs. John<lb/>ston some time, had she not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—they had been intimate for some years—my wife made a remark to me about the plate, but she told me that Mrs. Johnston wished to see me on some business at Curzon-street—I know that Mrs. Johnston is connected with a highly respectable family—I have heard also that the prisoner is connected with a very respectable family, but I know nothing of him previous to this—when I first went there I took some expensive jewellery with me—I took several diamond rings; one very valuable, worth something like fifty guineas—I do not know that I put it on I the prisoner's finger; he tried it on, himself—I did not try to persuade him I to take it—I might have suggested to him that it should be booked to him, and that he had better keep it; but not with the intention of making him buy it—I do not recollect saying that I would book it to him—I cannot I swear that I did not say so—there was only one thing I thought he might I have bought; a little bracelet for his wife—I had some with me at about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I did not offer to book a bracelet—the plate was to be paid for at Christmas; and to be supplied as soon as I could get it—I cannot swear I that I did or did not propose to him that a diamond ring should be booked to him—I proposed to him the same as to any other gentleman that I call on with goods—he said the ring was too expensive, but I never proposed to I him to book anything at all, except the plate—I should not have allowed him to have bought the ring unless he paid ready money for it—I could not let a man look out jewellery and plate like that at a first transaction—he was to have credit for the plate, but nothing more—that would amount to about 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I would not have allowed him to have both; I would go beyond 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—no letter was written to me, asking me whether the plate was ready—I had a letter requesting me to call, as Mr. Johnston wanted to see me; and I did call—I took nothing at all with me then—I did not take any jewellery when I took the plate—in the course of the conversation about jewellery I said, "If Mrs. Johnston is going to a party, if you come down to our house I shall be happy to let you hire some jewellery": that is our business, we charge 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per cent.—it was on the next day, Friday, that they called and selected the bracelets—I was not in when the neck ornament was returned—that was worth thirty guineas—they had two bracelets and a neck orna<lb/>ment—the plate that lent was some plated and some silver—at a rough guess, the quantity I should think, would amount to about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., taking plate and silver together—I was not in when they were returned—Mr. Brook is here—when they called and looked at the bracelets and other</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186010220089"/>
               <p>things, they did not propose to take one bracelet first, and I suggest that they had better have the two—I did not wish to dictate to them what they were to wear—they chose both bracelets—they did not choose first one and then another—I might have shown Mrs. Johnston five or six diamond tiaras—I showed her one worth about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 1500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not recollect whether she said it would be too showy—I did not propose to her to hire it; they were merely shown to her as to anybody who would come into the shop, as a curiosity—Mr. Brook was there at the time I was showing them—I will swear there was no proposal that she should hire or borrow it—I will swear that I did not say, "I have known Mrs. Johnston a long time; I can man<lb/>age these matters; and you shall have them without paying any per centage—Mr. Brook was present when they chose the things—there is a Mr. Dewling in the establishment—Mr. Brook showed me a letter that was written by Mrs. Johnston—I don't recollect showing it to Mr. Johnston's servant, in Curzon-street; I might have done so—I believe Mr. Lewis has the letter in his possession—if I showed a letter to the servant, purporting to be written by Mrs. Johnston to Mr. Brook, that must have been the letter—I did not say that I was aware that the bracelets had been taken back to the shop with the other plate, and had been hired at the shop from Mr. Brook again—I could not say anything of that kind for I was away from London—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the book in which I made the entry of the bracelets when they were taken out—it is a book which we all use—Mr. Dewling is here—as a description of the things is entered, with the stock number and price on hire, every figure and letter is my writing—when the necklace was returned it was crossed out—I could not recollect the num<lb/>her without referring to the stock-book—there is no price to that, because I could not recollect the price; the ticket had got torn off—the price is put to the other things, because I had the tickets before me and copied them without any trouble—I wrote these words, "on hire," at the bottom of this same entry—I wrote the whole of that entry—I did not scratch this part out—that was done in my absence; when the things were returned the next day—here are four here; one was a small chain with a separate number—it is not our way of doing business to make an entry here to show the time at which the articles were to be returned: we trust to people's words—we enter them on sale or return—everything in that book, nearly, is on sale or return—it is for memoranda of everything that occurs in the day—the date is quite sufficient for us—they are not on hire as long the party chooses to keep them—these articles were agreed to be lent for one night; for a dinner party—there is no memorandum that they were to be returned at one o'clock—we never make memoranda of that sort—they are booked in a day-book, but there are only the words, "See waste book," in that—this is the waste book, and it is the book in which we generally enter articles lent on hire—"on hire," and "on sale or return," I understand to be one and the same thing—all through the book you will find articles entered "on hire"—sometimes we write "lent" and sometimes "on hire"—I was not present when the bracelets were returned—I was out of England when the officer was at the pawnbroker's—I did not go to the house on the Tuesday, the night before Mr. Johnston was taken—I was in Belgium—I did not get the address in Wiesbaden, from the servant—I got it from Mr. Wetherall, an ironmonger, of Chapel-street, Mayfair, close by the prisoners; a man who supplied Mr. Johnston with ironmongery—he knew the address and supplied it to me—the only entry made by Dewling would be the cross<lb/>ing, the scratching out, upon the return of the two things; the others would be left open.</p>

I left town on the 11th August, the next day and this entry was made by me—the person who gave me the address in Wiesbaden was an ironmonger who was in correspondence with them—I went to him several times to ask if he knew where Mr. and Mrs. Johnston had gone—I got the address, <hi rend="italic">Poste restante</hi>, Carlsbad, which was of no me to me—that was written on an envelope which the servant gave me—I went to the ironmonger who was in correspondence with the prisoner—he gave me the address, Stein Hotel, Wiesbaden, and also showed me a letter which he had received with a cheque for a little bill—that was all which passed about the address—my wife has known the prisoner's wife, before the prisoner's wife's marriage—ever since her childhood—the prisoner's wife has been married to him since last March, I believe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Mr. Attenborough of 33, Pica<lb/>dilly, pawnbroker—I know the prisoner—he has pledged various articles from time to time, at my master's shop—he pledged these two bracelets with me on, I think, 9th August—I have not the duplicate or my book with me—(<hi rend="italic">The witness was directed to fetch them.</hi>) <hi rend="smallCaps">HENRY SMITH</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-sergeant, A</hi>). On Tuesday, 11th September, I watched the prisoner's house, 10, Curzon-street—I was not able to see him there—I ultimately went to a coffee-shop in Davies-street—about half-past 5 o'clock in the evening of 12th September I went to Mr. Attenborough's shop—I took the prisoner into custody as he was leaving the shop—he was out on the pavement, just going to get into a cab that was waiting—I told him my name was Smith, that I was a sergeant of the detective police, and should apprehend him for stealing two bracelets, the property of Mr. Han<lb/>cock—he said, "Cannot it be arranged?"—I told him I had no power over Mr. Hancock, and he must come to the station at Vine-street, close by—he handed me these two bracelets—they were wrapped up in paper in his hand—we then went back to Mr. Attenborough's—I asked Mr. Attenborough who was there, and the young man Topp, who took them in, to give me some particulars—they refused to do so—the prisoner was taken to the station and locked up—I searched him—before we got to the station Sergeant Robinson put his hand in the prisoner's coat-pocket and took out these two cases for the bracelets (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him if his name was Dimsdale, and he said, "No; my name is Johnston"—he was searched at the station—amongst other things I found upon him this passport (<hi rend="italic">granted August 10th, 1860.</hi>), these two telegrams, and 77<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—I did not find various pawnbroker's duplicates; Robinson found those.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were you sent for from Mr. Attenborough? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a young man came at that very time—he is outside—I don't know his name—I do not know that he was sent from Mr. Attenborough's—I under<lb/>stood he came from Mr. Hancock's, but that I don't know—when I got there Porter, one of Hancock's men, was already arrived—he was talking to the prisoner at the time he was about to get into the cab—I had the jewellery from the prisoner—I am decidedly under the impression that I had it from the prisoner's own hand—I would sooner say that I did than that I did not—Porter is here—I had not been to the house in Curzon-street before</p>

               <p>he was apprehended—I had been watching the house—I went to the servant afterwards, and told her that he was in custody—his child was at Curzon-street too; it remained there, I believe, all the time he was away, as far as I know—I had no communication at all with the servant.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>10th August—they talked about having a dinner party many times—the prisoner had respectable people visit him; ladies of title—I don't remember that, on the night the jewels came, Mr. and Mrs. Johnston went out full dressed—Mrs. Johnston went out, but I cannot say whether she was dressed or not—they did not tell me at all what time they would return, or for about how long they were going—it was on the Sunday that I saw Mr. Johnston—I told him then that Hancock's people had been about the bracelets—the police-constables had not been at that time—I did not know that the police were in search of him—he brought his portmanteau and things to Curzon-street on the Sunday—it was after I told him that the people had been about the bracelets that he took them away—I knew that he was at Davies-street—I was waiting on Wednesday, expecting Mr. Johnston, from 4 o'clock till 6 in the evening—he had given me directions to wait—I was waiting by his directions from 4 till 6 in the evening, in Queen-street, Oxford-street—on Monday 10th, and Tuesday 11th, after Mr. Johnston returned, people came to me from Hancock's—Mr. Thomas, one of the assistants, came to me—I went to Hancock's on the 10th, at night, and there saw Mr. and Mrs. Hancock, and Mr. Thomas and another person—I told Mr. Hancock at that time, that they would have the bracelets on Wednesday—I can't say what he said to me upon that—he asked me whether I was sure, and I said I was quite sure they would be there on the Wednesday—on the following day, Tuesday, Hancock's man again came to Curzon-street—I told Mr. Hancock that he would have the bracelets on Wednesday evening, in consequence of what Mr. Johnston had told me—Mr. Burbrook showed me a letter addressed to Mr. Brook—Mr. Johnston had given me that letter to post to Mr. Brook—I can't remember the day when Mr. Burbrook came; I think it was about a week before Mr. Johnston was arrested—that letter was posted by me on the Monday morning after they left home on the Sunday—I have received some money for my own use, from the prisoner, while he was away—I know that other people also received money from him while he was away; the gentleman told me him<lb/>self—I saw the draft brought by the banker's clerk—he wanted an indorse<lb/>ment upon it—there were no complaints at all from the tradespeople there of their not being paid by the prisoner—there were additions made to the furniture of the house just immediately before they left, and while they were away—pictures were brought from his mother's, and hung on the walls—it is a large house.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were they ever taken out of your possession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only partially by my man—the interest was taken for that day, before the second ticket was made out, and then they were repledged—the interest was paid afterwards when he redeemed the bracelet—there was some paid at the time—I am not quite certain what interest was paid when the 125<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced—I charged them a certain amount of interest—I did not charge them the month's interest—the sum will appear from our books—I paid 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I don't know anything about a box"—he then went up stairs again—he came down again in about five minutes, and said it was his cash-box—I said, "I will go and speak to him"—I went up and the prisoner went up with me—Mr. Gordon said, "Do you know anything about my box?"—I then looked and missed the box—I said, "I left it there at 7 o'clock this morning"—the prisoner was there and he heard that—he did not say anything—Mr. Gordon said there was 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it and a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—he said, "I would give 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if you could find it for me"—I said I could not find it for I did not know anything about it—it has never been found.</p>

               <p>supper at about half-past 8—this occurred at a quarter-past 10—I had been walking about between half-past 8 and a quarter-past 10—I went up Holborn, down Regent-street, and up Ludgate-hill—I had made no calls at any place whatever; not at any public-house—I took my watch out to see the time by Bennett's clock, not half a minute previous to its being taken—I don't know who the other man was; he was dressed in dark clothes: I cannot describe them particularly—my attention was more par<lb/>ticularly drawn to the prisoner—I know the other man had a cap on—the prisoner had a hat—when they first came up I had accused the woman of taking my watch—I was holding her—she was not struggling particularly; merely to get away—she was struggling to get out of my grasp, and I was endeavouring to hold her fast—I did not see what she did with her hand when it was behind her—the other man was at her side at that time; not behind her; about half a yard from her—the prisoner, when he came up, I said, "What is the matter?"—the watch had been passed when the woman put her hand behind her—I saw the female with her left hand give that man my watch, and I then told him that he had my watch, for I could see it—he was then at liberty, standing between the two—we were all three very close together—it was under the lamp—directly the female gave the prisoner my watch, I let go of the other two and pursued the right one—the other man did not struggle when I had hold of his arm—he did not try particularly to get away from me—he may have pulled a little—I was holding him with one arm, and the woman with the other, at the time I saw the watch passed—the prisoner struck me directly I told him he had my watch—I did not strike him again—I did not lose sight of him when I ran after him—I was as quick as he was—he endeavoured to conceal himself but I could see him—he merely went down some steps, and stooped down a little—I was crying out "Stop thief!" at the time, and then he ran again up the passage, and the policeman caught him—the policeman was not coming up the passage—he was at the top of the passage, in Ironmonger-lane, when he caught the prisoner—I saw a policeman, or some one, up at the end on the passage—I don't know whether the prisoner saw the policeman or not; he ran into his arms—I did not first charge the other man with stealing my watch, I never accused him; I accused the right one—it was not raining—I did not take particular notice whether it was cloudy—there was no lamp where this concealment took place; it was perfectly dark—only the prisoner ran there—the female and the other man went down towards Guildhall—the prisoner was running alone at the time he concealed himself—the female had not run up the court where he was taken—she ran away twice—I caught her once—she ran quite the opposite direction to the passage the first time—the other man did not run down Church-passage at all—I did not keep my eye on the other man and the woman, to know which way they turned—I could not tell whether they doubled back—there are not any side entrances communicating with that passage, that I am aware of—I never was down there before, or since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant in the service of Messrs. McCullock; wholesale druggists, of 5, Coleman-street—the firm consists of William McCul<lb/>lock and one other—on the afternoon of 24th September, a few minutes before one, in consequence of directions I received, I watched the prisoner, and saw him take a packet of pills out of the drawer, and put them in his trousers pocket—Frampton's pill of Health was kept in that drawer—there are half-dozen and dozen packets—from the size of the package I could see that it contained a dozen boxes—he then went down stairs—the pills were not in a drawer upon a floor on which he was employed—after he went down stairs, he returned in, I dare say, four or five minutes, and then pro<lb/>ceeded to his own department, and then he fetched a parcel out, which I believe contained trousers, but I did not see them—he then went down stairs in a direction to leave the premises—I did not follow him—I cannot tell whether he left the premises—Blair's pill was kept in the drawer as well as Frampton's.</p>

               <p>him take a dozen of Frampton's pills—the prisoner said he had not taken anything off the premises—he gave it a flat contradiction at once, and protested, over and over again, that he was perfectly innocent—a police-constable was sent for, and he was taken away—there were several young men in the department where I saw him take the box, but they were washing preparatory to going to dinner—they would be in the same room as the prisoner was—it is a long floor—there is a number of rows of drawers right across the room, which would prevent their seeing, as the supports go from the floor to the ceiling, and underneath are casks—there is no one here besides myself, who saw this act of his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman in the service of Messrs. McCullock—from information I received I watched the prisoner—on 24th September, in consequence of what Bishop told me, I followed the prisoner into Swan-yard, where he met a strange man—they walked together into Moorgate-street towards the Bank—they went down on the right hand side towards the Bank, and near the end of Moorgate-street they parted, the prisoner going into Coleman-street again, and the other person towards Finsbury-square—I did not observe that before they parted, anything had taken place between them; they were not out of my sight—during the time they went from Swan-alley to Moorgate-street they were in conver<lb/>sation, I should imagine, from their closeness—they both walked rather rapidly, close to each other, but not arm in arm—I did not, during the walk, see the arm of either person raised—the prisoner returned to the warehouse again, and during that time I lost sight of him—he came out again and I followed him again—after the strange man and the prisoner parted, I followed the prisoner into Coleman-street again, into the Three Tuns dining-rooms, and told him he had better come back to the warehouse with me—I did not say why—he asked what I wanted him back for—I told him he would see when we got back—I took him into the counting-house—we sent for a policeman, and he was given into custody—I went to Marl<lb/>borough-street—he was accused of taking scammony and, pills from the warehouse—Mr. Squire spoke then—the prisoner said he had not stolen anything—Bishop was not sent for—Mr. Squire, who is one of the principals, was there—Bishop came down into the counting-house after the prisoner was brought back—Mr. Squire asked him, in the prisoner's presence, what he had seen the prisoner do, and he said he saw him take these pills from a drawer—the prisoner was searched at the station.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When Bishop said he had taken a parcel of pills oat of the drawer, surely the prisoner said something? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he said he had not taken anything—he repeated his denial all along from the very first moment we accused him—I had had some communication with Mr. Bishop previously—Mr. Bishop is one of the persons employed at the establishment, as the prisoner was—I saw the prisoner leave the establishment and return—I did not lose sight of him from the time he parted with his friend till he went to the Three Tuns—the place which has been described as where the pills are kept, is on the first floor—the ground-floor is devoted to business purposes too—the prisoner was there for the purpose of finishing off bottles of castor oil—he had nothing to do with the making of the pills, he was there for the purpose of finishing off bottles of castor oil—my department is on the ground floor—I was at the station when he was searched—taking</p>

I am a labourer, of 6, Priuce's-court, Newport-market—on 6th September, about 10 minutes to 2 in the morning, I was standing at the corner of St. Martin's-lane attending to a coffee stall—I saw an old gentleman cross from the Cranbourne hotel to the hoarding where the new street is being built—three men followed him, and when they got about thirty or thirty-five yards from the corner where I was, they pounced on him and dragged him to the ground—I saw the men run across and grapple with one man—somebody halloed, "Stop thief," and they ran down St. Martin's-lane—one turned into Long-acre and one kept straight on—a policeman came up to him in Cranbourne-street, but three women came to where the old gentle-man stood and took him away—I went to the middle of the road and picked up this stick (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which the old gentleman had—Pratt is one of the three who pounced on him, but the other two men were much shorter than the Donovans—I did not pay most attention to Pratt—I had a woman at my coffee-stall, and had four shillings' worth of halfpence in one of the cups, and I paid most attention to them—I will not take my oath that I saw Pratt robbing the old gentleman, but I saw the policeman grapple with him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the secretary of the Provident Institution for savings, at St. Martin's-place, Charing-cross—I keep the rules and regula<lb/>tions of the society—a depositor when he opens an account is required under the terms of the Act of Parliament, to sign a declaration that he has no money in any other savings bank—he receives a deposit-book—this is one of the books (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is the original deposit-book given to George Hunter, on 31st September, 1844—the address is entered in another book—this is not the book that is signed by the depositor—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is signed on 31st September, 1844, by George Hunter, described as a gentleman's servant, living at Duke-street, Grosvenor-square—money was paid in by him from time to time—140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money, and the other is the accu<lb/>mulation of interest, amounting, as far as this book goes, to 168<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this book is made up to the 20th May, 1854—the last deposit was on 3d June, 1850—no depositor can put in more than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on 16th May, 1860, I found that the accumulation of interest made 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I wrote to inform the depositor of it—this is the letter I wrote—it was forwarded to George Hunter—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>): 16th May, 1860—Sir, I beg to inform you that the deposit made in your name amounts to the sum of 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., no further interest therefore, can, by Act of Parliament, be paid on your amount un<lb/>less you decrease your amount under 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. You are requested to acknow<lb/>ledge the receipt of this letter"—the postal address is Mr. George Hunter, 10, George-yard, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square—there is "Robert George Hunter" in the corner—that was done afterwards at the office—the prisoner afterwards produced that letter at the office—he attended with a friend of his of the name of Cox, a greengrocer—they both came into my room—I said, "Is your name George Hunter?"—he said, "Yes"—I said, "Where is your book?"—he said, "I have not got it"—I asked what had become of it, and he said it had been destroyed in a fire some years ago—I asked him why he had not made an earlier application about it, and then his friend Cox immediately said, that he had received an injury upon his head, and he did not trouble himself much about his concerns, and it was on that account that he came with him—I then told the prisoner that the first step was, that he must give us formal notice of the loss of the book—I then took him to the officer whose duty it is to take a record of these matters, and he then signed the book—it is a form that we fill up—when the application is made it is signed—this is it, the name of depositor is Robert George Hunter, originally paid in as George Hunter—the date of the application, 4th June, 1860, the original address is not filled up; name of the applicant, Robert I George Hunter; address, 1, Frederick's mews—that was signed by the prisoner, "Robert George Hunter"—I saw him write it—that money paid in as by George Hunter, was paid on 4th June; the day of the application—I have no doubt the officer did not put in the address because we thought that the prisoner was the original depositor—I did not know at that time whether it was made out originally in the name of George or Robert George Hunter—I then told the prisoner that it was always our practice, when the money amounted to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., to allow them to have it immediately; but I said he must wait a week, and he came again on the following week, the 11th, with Cox—a fresh book had not been made out in the meanwhile; we waited till the depositor attended—I was directing a deposit-book to be made out when he came in with Cox—Cox looked at the manager, Mr. Robert</p>

               <p>Thompson and said, "I beg your pardon, but I think I know you very well"—Mr. Thompson did not immediately recognize him, and Cox said, "I am a greengrocer living in the neighbourhood of Connaught-square, and I have been in the habit of supplying your family with vegetables"—Mr. Thompson said, "Oh, I recollect you perfectly well"—he then said he came to make the application for this money belonging to his friend Hunter—upon which Mr. Thompson said, "I know you very well, but I know Hunter better; he occupies stables under my brother-in-law, and I am in the habit of hiring his flys, and it is only a few days since that he drove myself and family to the Crystal Palace; I have known him for some time, and what<lb/>ever he tells you, you may rely upon"—I then gave orders for a new deposit-book to be made out, and he was to receive the money which would have been a small amount at that time—he asked if he might not have a larger sum at once—I asked how much he required—he said he should like to have 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said of course he could have it; as he was so well known, he might have it at once—he was paid the 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and that sum was entered in a book as allowed without notice; a new book was given to him—he was paid by Mr. Scallon, the cashier—I sent him to the proper ledger clerk and cashier to pay him; after that Mr. Scallon came in and told me there was some difficulty about the signature of the depositor—I am not quite sure whether that was in the prisoner's presence, and then I called the prisoner and inquired how he accounted for the variation in the signature—it was signed Robert George Hunter, the name of the depositor being only George Hunter—I asked him the original address, which corresponded with that in our books—he gave me in words an address which corresponded with the original—Mr. Scallon and I then conferred together and we thought it would be much better to get the name corrected—we allowed him to correct it in the signature-book—he altered his name according to Mr. Scallon's direction, and after that he was paid the money.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Battersea, and am manager and foreman to Thomas Dives, a miller—his mill is situated in Church-road, Battersea; it abuts on the river Thames near Battersea church—the mill is separated from the churchyard by a malt-house, belonging to Messrs. Watley's—I last saw the premises safe about half-past 8 o'clock on the Saturday night—I think it was 1st September—I secured the doors myself—I was called up the next morning about 5 o'clock—I found the door broken, and the premises had been entered by breaking the padlock and undoing the bolt—there was a lock and bar to the door; they broke the counting-house open, and then came to the drawers—the counting-house desk was not locked, because there was nothing but halfpence in it—I missed from it twopence and a counterfeit half-crown that had been there for years; some receipt stamps, and inland revenue stamps—my attention was brought to the water-butt on the same morning—the carter came to the stable and found there a <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>, and diffe<lb/>rent things in the trough, and I went to it and took them out—I found the <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>, a kind of a small handspike, a boring bit, and a kind of life preserver, or whip with a large handle to it—I took them to the police-station—Sergeant Payne has them—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the <hi rend="italic">jimmy</hi>; this is the centre-bit, and this is the life preserver, or the handle of a whip it looks like—I had not seen these things on the premises before.</p>

               <p>on Sunday morning, 2d September—about half-past 1 o'clock in the morning, as I was "walking along Church-road, I saw four men—I see three of them now, Mahoney, Barton, and Hayward—they went in the direction of Battersea Old Church—I followed them, I should think about 100 yards, till I lost sight of them about the end of the church wall—they went down towards the dock which runs alongside the lower end of the church-yard—I went back to Phoenix Wharf, where I had a view of the river—I there saw five men in a boat—I believe that is the boat which I have since ascertained to be the Metropolis—they were just coming gently up towards the wall; not rowing—they had no oars or sculls in their hands, but were coming gently up towards the land—I went and met Sergeant Payne—I returned with him—when he and I got to the Phoenix Wharf we saw the five men close under the wall of Mr. Dives' mill, in the boat—there were seven or eight barges near the wharf, but not lying close up to the pre<lb/>mises—there was an open space between the barges and the wall, enough for a boat to go in between—Sergeant Payne then left me a little while to procure further assistance—while he was gone I kept watching the pro<lb/>ceedings—before he left me, four men out of the five got out of the boat on to the landing-place of the wharf, and went to a door at the rear of the mill—they stopped there a second or so, and I heard a slight noise-directly afterwards, the four entered the mill; the fifth remained in the boat—I supposed they entered through a door; it was in a line with me, and upon subsequent examination I found that it was a door into the mill—these four men remained in the mill, I should say, about five minutes; it may be a minute or two more, I will not say exactly—I observed the boat during the whole time they were in—the fifth man did not remain in the boat all the time they were in—one of the four came out again and assisted him in getting on to the landing, and he went in—after they had been in the mill some little time, the five men came out again, and stood on the landing-place outside the mill—two out of the five got into the boat, one was Barton, I cannot say who the other was—after those two had been in the boat a minute or two, Sergeant Payne came up in the boat, and directly got on to the barge, and called out to me by name "Stirling"—I said, "I am here"—and I called to the other two constables who had arrived, Baker and Gennery—the two men, of whom I said Barton was one, were in a situation where they could see the approach of Payne in the boat-directly Sergeant Payne sang out to me, they began to run away—Barton got on to the barge and made for Bridge's coal wharf, adjoining Mr. Dives' flour mill—I immediately followed after him up the wharf, and apprehended him on a heap of coals about half way up the yard—on seeing me he said, "For God's sake don't hit me; be a man; I will go quiet"—I said, "It is all I want of you if you will do so"—I had my staff out—I called out to a constable in the front of the house, to look out—I opened the front gates of Bridge's wharf and went out into the main road—Gennery assisted in taking him down the road to the old church—we remained there some few minutes till Sergeant Payne came ashore from the boat with the prisoner Hayward—Sergeant Payne and I held the two prisoners some few minute, and directed Baker and Gennery to go in search of the other prisoners—I did not see anything of the other prisoners at the time I had Barton in custody, and was taking him out of Bridge's yard—it was afterwards that I saw them, while I was standing against the old church, with Barton and Hayward in custody—while standing there with them, I saw Mahoney come from the church wall on to the shore—he ran across the drawing dock</p>

               <p>where they land goods; and just as ha got to the corner of Mr. Lintill's, the Swan public-house, he fell down by the water—he got up again and went to the rear of Mr. Lintill's premises and there I lost sight of him—I called Sergeant Payne's attention to that—I saw him again shortly afterwards in the custody of Sergeant Payne and Gennery—upon looking about at the spot where I seized Barton, I found a life preserver on the coals—Sergeant Payne has it—the same morning I searched the church-yard from which I saw Mahoney coming, and found this life preserver, and this other I found in Mr. Bridge's coal wharf—when I saw Mahoney come from the church-yard he was sitting on the wall; he jumped forward from the wall—I observed, when he was in custody afterwards, that he had a cut on the head—I examined it when we got to the station—it was a splendid night—the moon shone bright as any day.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, 19 V</hi>). On Sunday, 2d September, about 2 o'clock, or a few minutes after, I saw Stirling at Phoenix-wharf—there was a boat there named the Metropolis, containing five men—they were rowing towards the back of Mr. Dives' mill, towards the head of some barges—it ultimately drew up between the barges and the wall—the man that was rowing stood up, and took hold of the chain fastening the barges to the shore—that was the prisoner Cecil—I saw Barton get out of the boat and ascend the bank towards the mill-door—he had something in his hand about two-feet long, which appeared like a stick—the others got out, one after the other—Mahoney and Hayward were two of them—I told Stirling to remain there till he saw me or heard from me again—I went away for assistance, and brought back a waterman named Coates in a boat—he rowed very fast, but very quietly, with his back towards the spot—I laid down in the boat, so that I should not be observed—I saw two men standing against the door—I could not say who they were, but Cecil was standing in the boat as when I left him before—I had a double opportunity of seeing his face, for the moon was shining brightly on it, and I turned my bull's-eye on him, not particularly to see him, but to look at the back of the mill—I saw him, at the same time I called out, "Look out, Stirling," because at that moment Barton ran in that direction—Sterling called out, "I am here"—I drove Cecil across the barges into the water—he went under the water, and I never saw anything more of him at that time—at that moment I heard Baker's voice from Mr. Dives' lawn calling out, "Look out, sergeant, here are two swimming in the water"—I called Coates, got into the boat, and said, "Row me to Mr. Watman's wall," that was in the direction of the voice—the tide was running so very fast, that I knew the men would not swim much against it—there are a number of piles which they might bring fast to, under the wall, and I saw Hayward hanging there, with part of his head above the post, dripping with water—he said, "For God's sake do not hurt us, sergeant, I am very nearly drowned"—in endeavouring to get him off the post the boat very nearly capsized, and I tumbled into the water with him—about six or ten minutes after, I landed again and saw Sterling standing in the churchyard with Barton in custody, but I was not in the churchyard—I heard somebody call out terrifically, at the back of the church as if they were being knocked about, and one of the prisoners, I believe Hayward, said, "What a b—shame to knock a man about like that," judging that it was a policeman knocking the prisoners about—I saw Dunnaway coming, and said, "Go and see what is the matter, Dunnaway" he jumped over the wall—about a minute or more afterwards I saw Mahoney running across the churchyard, and heard some voice say, "Come on"—I cannot say who it proceeded from—I saw Mahoney jump out of the churchyard into, the dock—I saw the constable Baker come out of the churchyard, bleeding very much from the head—his trousers were covered with blood—it was about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour after that, that I took Mahoney—I could not leave my prisoners, and he had disappeared for five or six minutes—I called to Coates, and went to the back of the premises</p>

On Sunday, 2d September, I heard screams from the direction of the churchyard—I went in the direction of the screams—about 2 o'clook in the morning I was on duty in Bridge-road, Battersea, and saw Sergeant Payne running down the Bridge-road—I went to meet him—he told me to get assistance and go to Dives' wharf—I went there—when I got over the palings I saw a man in a boat close to the barges—I took Baker with me—I said to him, "We are in the wrong; we must go back to the wharf"—we went to the wharf and there I saw Stirling on the look out—he said, "They are inside, at work"—after waiting a few minutes Stirling said, "Look out at the front"—I passed the word to Baker</p>

               <p>and he went out at the front—presently I heard a loud whistle in the ground in front of the mill, and some one called out, "Look out"—I heard some one running towards the wall in the Church-road, and as if some one was jumping down—I then heard a noise in the direction of the Phoenix wharf, and saw Stirling bring out the prisoner Barton—Baker came up to him and said, "Is that you?" and went in the direction of the churchyard—I waited a few minutes, till Sergeant Payne came with Hayward—I was going in the direction of Dives' mill afterwards, and then I heard a load scream—I leaped over the churchyard wall, and then saw Mahoney run from Baker—I went up to Baker—he said, "Make haste, he has run round the back of the church"—I ran round the front, thinking I should meet him, but he ran under the darkness of the wall, and I could not see him just at that minute—some one outside the churchyard palings said, "Go it, Gennery, you must have him!"—the prisoner Mahoney, who was on the churchyard wall, then turned round and said, "Yes, come on!"—I was present when he was apprehended—I then jumped over the wall again, and got on to the road, and went in search of him—I went round to Dives' mill, got into the boat Coates was in, and went in the direction of the Old Swan-going along, Sergeant Payne said, "Let me come with you," and he came into the boat—we got out of the boat—I saw where some water had dropped, and followed up the track—it appeared as if some one had got over the wall—Sergeant Payne got over the wall first, and I got on the wall with him—we there found the prisoner Mahoney in a dust-hole or coal<lb/>hole—he was there secured—when we were in the reserve room at the station, Mahoney said that, if he knew what I was going to do, he would have broken my b—y neck, coming down the wall—when I first saw him, he was, I should think, four or half a dozen yards from Baker.</p>

"F" warehouse, and saw two bags there—I examined them—they con<lb/>tained barley—there was barley in the "F" warehouse at that time—I examined the contents of the bags with the contents of the bulk in the warehouse, and the barley was similar in quality—the bags are here, and I have some of the bulk in my pocket—the bags do not belong to the company—upon finding the bags I said something to an officer, and he watched in consequence—the value of the corn is about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

I am an accountant—on Friday, 24th August last I was engaged by the prisoner as a clerk, at a weekly salary, at Portsmouth Chambers—he professed to be the Secretary of a society for the abolition of imprisonment for debt—the business was purported to be carried on at those chambers—he said that Sir Richard Bethell was the promoter of it, and also Mr. Edwin James—on 28th August I had been to the Queen's Bench to see if any subscription had been paid in by Captain Hudson, and, immediately on my return, the prisoner produced this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and asked me to get it cashed—this is his endorsement, written in my presence—I believe the body of it to be his writing also, inasmuch as the E in Howell is the same in each—it is a sort of Greek E—he told me to endeavour to get it cashed—that it came by post, too late, from Sir Richard Bethell, and he could not pay it into the bankers—I took it to my friend Mr. knight, a publican in Vere-street, who said he could not conveniently spare the money as it was Saturday night—I said, "If you cannot get it cashed all I require is to borrow 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it, which will serve the purpose for this evening—I got 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Mr. Knight, and gave it to the prisoner—I saw him again on the Sunday evening, and he made an appointment to meet me at half-past 9 on Monday morning, requesting me to come to the office half an hour earlier, as he had to go to the City to get some money from his bankers—he re<lb/>quested me to go to Mr. Knight, and ask him to retain the cheque till 11 o'clock, when he would return the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and take Sir Richard Bethell's cheque and pay it into his bankers—he never came to the office, and I never saw him again till he was in custody a fortnight afterwards—I have never seen this envelope before, except in the hands of another gentleman—I have no doubt it is the prisoner's writing—(<hi rend="italic">Cheque read</hi>: 25th August, 1860, Messrs.

I am a leather shaver in the employ of Thomas Young Learmouth and Mr. Roberts, leather-manufacturers, Page's wharf Ber<lb/>mondsey—there are four persons besides me employed in the shaving<lb/>department—a man of the name of Harrison was employed there with me—on Thursday, 16th August last, twenty dozen calf-skins went into the shaving-yard to be dipped and shaved—five dozen and a half of them were dipped on that day in the dye house—after we wetted them we took them up stairs again into the shaving shop—on the Tuesday following, in con<lb/>sequence of something said by my employers, I counted the skins, and found one dozen missing—they were in what we call a perishable state, spotted—they were not in a marketable state—Harrison was discharged on Wed<lb/>nesday, the 22d—I afterwards saw some skins before the Magistrate—they were part of the missing dozen, only they had been <hi rend="italic">skived</hi> over—that means taking off the thick part, and reducing them to a proper substance—these are the skins (<hi rend="italic">looking at two parcels</hi>)—here is the mark I refer to—it is a spot caused from mould.</p>

               <p>skins did not make much difference, I would take them of him at the rate of 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me a receipt for the money, which I have here—on 22d August, four days afterwards, I saw a newspaper parcel lying on the table of my warehouse—my wife told me something—I did not open it till next morning, I then found it contained these half-dozen skins—they were not dry, but partly shaved; they were not in a marketable state—I never sell or buy skins in such a state—I placed both parcels in the hands of the police.</p>

I live at 8, Harding-terrace, Camberwell New-road, and am a journeyman butcher—on the afternoon of 14th September, I was at the Greyhound—two women came in—I saw one of them give a counterfeit shil<lb/>ling to the last witness—he bent it and said, "Cannot you give me a better one than this? this won't do for me"—he put it on the counter—I took it up, straightened it with a good one that the woman then put down, and then marked it with my teeth—the woman who had given it took it away—the two women went away together—I followed them—I had to go about 150 yards through a passage, and I saw the prisoner and the two women in com<lb/>pany—I watched them, and as soon as the women caught sight of me they all turned their backs to me and huddled up together in a lump—I could only see what was done, by the working of their arms behind them—the women then left the prisoner and passed me—the prisoner went the other</p>

               <p>way—I followed him about 70 or 80 yards; I was about 10 yards from him—he stooped down, and I ran after him and saw him pull out his hand from some fence—that was the same side of the road that we were walking—there was only a piece of high grass on the other side of the fence where he put his hand—as soon as he pulled his hand out I put my hand in and found there a paper package, which I opened—it contained four counterfeit shil<lb/>lings—one of them was the one which I had marked at the Greyhound, and which one of the women took away—I am sure of it—I then followed the man—as soon as he saw that I was following him, he turned and came back again towards me and passed me—I turned again and walked behind him—I said, "It is no use, old fellow; I shall stick to you"—he made use of a bad expression, and said that if I followed him any more he would knock my head in—I said, "Well, if you do, I suppose I shall be there"—he went into a brick-field and hid himself under a lot of leaves—I sent for a con<lb/>stable, one came up, and I gave the prisoner into his custody—I gave the constable the four shillings which I had found in the paper.</p>
