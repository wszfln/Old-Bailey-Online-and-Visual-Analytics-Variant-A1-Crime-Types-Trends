I am a short-hand writer—I attended as such on the Select Committee on the Berwick Election Petition—I have here my original notes of the evidence—(<hi rend="italic">Reads;</hi>"Examination in chief of William M'Gall. Do you mean to swear you did not offer anybody money for their votes on the polling day? No. Or give them money? I never asked any persons for their vote. Bid you give them money? No; not to induce them to poll. Did you give any money away on the polling day? No. Not a shilling? No. Nor lend any? No. Or offer any one? No, I did not. Did you promise anyone money? No, I did not.")</p>

You gave no money to any person on the day of the poll? No; I was not engaged at all in the matter by any person, but just took an interest to get the people up to the poll. You were at Gibson's on the polling day? Yes Do you remember what time? The fore part of the day, I think. Do you think it was as early as 10 o'clock? I might be there about 9 and about 11—I was just passing out and in. You were there between 9 and 10? Yes. But gave no money to any one about 9, as to a vote? No. You never gave money to any person? I never gave money to induce the people to vote. Without speaking about how they should vote? No people at all; if any person made such a statement, he is stating what is false of me.")</p>

               <p>No. Did you give him on the Sunday? No. Did you give him on the Monday? No; I gave him none. Have you never given him any money? Not at an election. Have you ever given him any money? In the summer I did. Before the election? Yes, long before the election; he came to me and said he was very unwell: he said he wanted a pair of shoes, and I gave him a shilling or two to help to buy them; I gave him no money at the election, and had no talk with him about money at the election. Did you never give him four sovereigns at all? No; not at any time. Not at the time of the election? No. Did you ever give him any part of four sovereigns? No. Not one, two, or three? No. Did you give them to anybody to give to him? No, I did not. Did four sovereigns never pass from you for Brown? No. Will you swear that? I will most distinctly—such a circumstance never existed. What is the most you have ever given him at a time? Never more than I have told you; two or three shillings. Did you give him two or three shillings about the election time? No, it was in the summer time. Since the summer up to this time you have never given him a shilling? No. And you have never given any person money for him? No; I most distinctly swear that. I will mention the circum<lb/>stance if you wish it of what took place. What did take place I was standing in the street with another party and he came up. <hi rend="smallCaps">SIR F.

               <p>I never had anything to say to him at all; he may be a resident in the town, but I do not know. You never had any transaction with him of any kind?

At any period of that day did you see the man who has just left the room? No, I did not at any period of the day. He has represented that between one and two a man pushed him into the room in which you were sitting at Henry Gibson's; that nobody was there but you and him; you asked him what he wanted,; he said he came for a trifle of money, and you gave him five sovereigns; is that true? No; no such conversation passed; I never saw the man. Is that true? No, it is not true; it is false. Did you ever give that man any money at all? None whatever; I never had any transaction with him; none whatever."</p>

We went back to the same house and met three men; we had one pot of porter, and I paid for it out of the shilling the man gave me. He then called for some more beer and some gin, and left the house; the barmaid had sent for some sixpences, and the waiter stopped us and said the money we had given was bad.</p>

On 6th June, about 4 o'clock, I saw Crouch go into a marine store dealer's shop, in St. Mary-at-hill, kept by a man named Daley, who is the husband of the woman at the bar—Cronch had a white apron on with a parcel in it, and a pitcher on his shoulder—he remained in there a few minutes and then came out with the pitcher in his hand, but without the parcel—I followed him to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Great Tower-street, where Mr. Pugh, his master, lives—going along I made a communication to Sergeant Funnell—I then returned with Crouch to St. Mary-at-hill—when we reached there I waited outside with him while Sergeant Fuunell went in—I was called in very soon afterwards, and went in with the boy—the prisoner Daley was there—she said as I went up stairs that the children were dressing in the front room where Mrs. Daley was—I saw some spilt coffee on the carpet—I then went up stairs—I saw one girl at the bed, putting some parcels between the bed and the bedclothes; pulling the clothes down—I looked there and found a large apron with raw coffee in it, and also currants, and sugar—I found some cochineal and indigo in the place; some of it was under the sofa—I went to the window of the top floor front room, and in the gutter I found three parcels of sugar—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the sugar about which this charge is—I have seen Crouch go there eight times before—when I went in Funnell had some sugar in his hand—Daley did not say anything then—she said something to Funnell while I was searching the house; I could not say what it was—in going up the house I saw one little girl on a ladder placed just over the staircase; there is a kind of trap through the skylight—I went up and found four parcels between the ledge and the parapet—I saw a hole cut through the ceiling into the shop, so that a person if kneeling down could see into the shop—we found a great quantity of things in searching the house—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of them.</p>

On 5th June, about 4 o'clock, I went to Pugh's, at Great Tower-street—I saw Crouch having some money in his band—I did not see Daley then, I saw her about quarter of an hour afterwards—I took Crouch back to Tower-street—he had a pitcher in his hand—I followed him into the warehouse, and said, "I am an officer; give me that money which you have just put in your pocket"—he pulled it out and gave me 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "What have you taken to Mrs. Daley's at St. Mary-at-hill, and sold?"—he said, "Sugar"—I said," Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From off the bench, and wrapped it up in some of that paper which lies in the corner"—I asked him how much he had taken; he said the woman told him 14lbs.—he pointed out some paper that lay in a corner of the warehouse on the bench where the sugar was taken from—he said the woman paid him the money—I said, "Now you must go back with me to St. Mary-at-hill;" that was to Mrs. Daley's—I left him in charge of Legg—we went down to Daley's; I left Legg outside—I went into Mrs. Daley's—I saw a woman in the shop, who I knew was not Mrs. Daley; Mrs. Daley was up stairs—the woman went up stairs to her, and then said that Mrs. Daley would come down in a few minutes—I heard a great noise overhead—I looked up and saw a square hole cut through the ceiling, and Mrs. Daley was kneeling down looking at me through it—there was a pane of glass that would move backwards and forwards, so that she could see any one that came into the shop—there was nothing over the pane of glass when I first saw it—I said to her, "now you must come down or else I shall come up there"—afterwards I found a piece of oil cloth that would cover over it—that was on the first floor—there is a table over it in the room to prevent any one tumbling through—Mrs. Daley came down, and I said, "Have you bought any sugar of any one to-day?"—she said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure: not of anybody?—she said, "No"—I said, "I have got the boy in custody that you bought some of just now, and he is outside the door"—I did not say what he had told me—she said, "Oh! come up here"—she went up stairs and I followed her—she pointed out those two parcels of sugar—they were lying on the drawers—I said, "How came you to tell me you had not bought any?"—she said, "The woman took it in"—I said, "Who paid for it?"—she said,"I did"—I said, "What did you give him?"—she said, "2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound"—I said, "You must come down stairs along with me"—I took the sugar down and called Legg and the boy in, and said to the boy, "Which of these two women paid you the money?"—the boy pointed to Mrs. Daley—I then told Legg to go and get another officer, which he did—as soon as the officer came he took charge of the boy and the sugar—we went up stairs—I told her she must consider herself in my custody—there is 15lbs. of sugar here, without the paper—I saw Legg find something in the room—he found some coffee in the bed—when I told Mrs. Daley that she must consider herself in my custody, she said, "Oh dear, I have been so careful about buying, for I was told that there were officers on the hill, watching our shop"—I made no answer to that—I enquired as to whose bed it was</p>

No. What was he doing? Walking in the road. Tell us what passed? He said, Mr. Fayerman I want to speak to you, and he took me down. What did you say? I said ‘Oh, very well, I am quite ready to speak to you.' What did he do? He took me down the road commonly called the Alma-road, just opposite the Victoria-gardens, and he said, 'Mr. Fayerman, are you going to support me and Sir Henry Stracey?' I said I had not made up my mind; he said, 'I suppose you want a little money,' I said it would be very acceptable; he said, 'Well, I will give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that is as much as I can afford, if you will vote for me and Sir Henry Stracey.' What did you say? I said, 'I will take it, and I will vote, and I will support you.' He said, 'If you will, after the election is over I will get you a situation on this new railway, if you will suppport me and my colleague.' Did he give you anything? He gave me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note. Is that it (<hi rend="italic">Handing a note to the witness</hi>)? It is, and there is my signature upon it. When did you write that on it?

You received this on the 18th of April, 1859, and promised to vote for Sir Emdond Lacon, did you? Yes. After that you said you had not made up your mind? Yes. You say that note was given to you on the 18th, and you promised to support Sir Edmond Lacon, and you told Mr. Reynolds that you had not made up your mind ten days afterwards? Yes, because I had not really made up my mind then. But you had taken this money then, and then you told Mr. Reynolds you had not made up your mind? Yes; because I did not know which way to go, as I always do when I am in doubt. Did you mention this to anybody, this gift of the note to anybody? No, not a word. You have got a wife, have you not? Yes, but she left me, and turned out a regular bad one."</p>

SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the Committee, after the evidence of Fayerman, you were yourself examined and I suppose cross-examined as to your statement? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes I was, and it was after that that the resolution with reference to the perjury of this man was found—my opinion was that this man was only a tool in the hands of others—that was and that is my belief—I did not intend to prosecute him unless that letter had appeared—I made my speech at the public dinner on 12th April—from that time until I had commenced proceedings against this man for perjury no step had been taken against me in an action—the two actions are brought each by an attorney—I only know from their publishing their own names that those parties were on the Committee—I was not aware of those persons having been bribed; I gave no authority for it—Mr. Reynolds is my agent—I have represented Yarmouth before in Parliament—this was the first time Sir Henry Stracey had stood—I am generally in the habit of smoking a cigar in the evening—whether I recollect the cigar on that evening, I recollect the meeting at the Victoria-garden—that was the only one—Mr. Marsh has been two or three times Mayor of Yarmouth—he was not so at the time of the election—he was chairman at my meeting—Mr. Preston is my attorney—Mr. Corry is my solicitor; I left the matter in his hands—the production of this note, which was produced at the Committee, or the apprehension of any evidence he might give on the trial have had no influence on my mind in reference to this trial.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a fly driver at Great Yarmouth—I was fly driver at the Royal Victoria Hotel in April, 1859—I remember the election at Yarmouth quite well—I remember driving Sir Edmond Lacon and Sir Henry Stracey to the Victoria-gardens on the evening of 18th of April—I left the Victoria Hotel from ten to twenty minutes after 8 o'clock; that is a short quarter of a mile from the gardens—on reaching the Victoria-gardens' gate the two members left the fly and walked into the gardens—I left the fly soon after and went in myself; I went straight to the pavilion; I saw the two members and heard them—after they had finished the meeting it wanted ten minutes or a quarter to 11; the meeting was then over—I then went first towards the fly and they followed me—on their coming up I opened the fly and let them in—I then shut the door, mounted the box, and drove towards the Victoria Hotel—on reaching there I saw them enter the house; that was about five or ten minutes to 11—I then took my horse in the yard; that was the end of my driving that night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to James Vavasseur and others, of 47, Cannon-street, silk manufacturers—the prisoner was in our employ on 10th April, as a weaver of silk, and had been so employed some time before that—on 16th April I gave him out forty yards of warp silk, that is unwoven silk; it weighed about forty-eight ounces—he signed a receipt for it—it was to be woven into silk—he was to make it up into neckties, and deliver it to us within twenty-eight days—I gave him a ticket, as is usual with us, telling him how the work was to be done, and in what time; that is the common course, and the workman signs the receipt—he was to make it up at a place occupied by him, No. 2, Golden-lane, City—that was a room he hired of us for that purpose—the loom there belonged to him, but the machine belonged to us—in the course of the manufacture it is necessary to use something called "leads," commonly called "lingoes;" they are small leads for the purpose of holding the silk; they also belonged to the firm—it is my duty to inspect the work as it goes on; I went to him on 26th May for the purpose of inspecting his work as he was going on with it—he was at work—as near as I could say about fifteen yards of silk was then-actually made up—if he had used proper diligence he should have brought his work home before that; the twenty-eight days had then expired some considerable time—I had paid him visits several times before that—it is very common for the work people to keep the work longer than the specified time—on 5th May, as near as I can say, he brought back sixteen and three-quarter yards—we considered that he ought to have brought us home eighteen yards; only a small quantity would be allowed for in the weaving—if we give out forty yards we should be content with receiving thirty-seven yards or so—the quantity that he was deficient would not be allowed for in the weaving—I went again on the 28th May; he was not there—it being Whit<lb/>Monday I did not take particular notice of that; the door was locked at the time—I believed that the silk was safe—on the 29th, next day, I went again and examined the house; I found he was gone—when I went in I missed the silk and the leads; he gave no more silk to me than what I have mentioned, but he left a small quantity behind, about five or six ounces, for</p>

               <p>which I have given him credit; that is part of the unmade silk—the whole of the silk that was manufactured was removed, and also part that was unmanufactured, and a small quantity of unmanufactured silk remained, the value of which was about 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—there was still a very large quantity deficient—ten guineas we estimate the value of that which was deficient—the lingoes were gone; more than 4,000—they were worth from 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I made a communication to the police.</p>

Q.</hi> How many bobbins of silk might you have found? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think there were seven or eight with silk on them, but they were not all full—there might perhaps have been eight or ten bobbins with silk on—I will not swear that I found eighteen bobbins—there were two or three smaller bobbins—I believe the number of bobbins was quite correct—it very much depends on how much silk one bobbin will hold—they may hold more or less than an ounce, most likely less, on an average twenty-five bobbins take a pound of silk—the warp bobbins hold from the fifth to the sixth part of an ounce each bobbin—I will not swear to the number of empty and full bobbins, but the number given out to you corresponded with the number that we found, added to those which you had previously returned at the warehouse—we have at the warehouse the account of the silk that we discovered, and we have given you credit for it—we have not charged you with stealing the silk which you left behind you—I do not charge you with twenty yards of ready-made work—we consider that there was from sixteen to seventeen yards of work made up at the time it was removed—I will swear that I saw thirteen yards of work made on 26th May—that was on your beam—I am not acquainted with the precise value of that work after it is ready-made—I know the value of silk before it is woven—I have not got the particulars of the exact weight that was given out—the length was forty yards—I have not got the precise weight of the sixteen and three-quarter yards of silk that I received home—I said I believed there were four or five more bobbins—I do not swear it—I think there was an ounce of silk on the warp—when I went to your house on Monday I saw several of the tenants who reside there; I saw your next door neighhour—I did not see you—I think I came between five and six o'clock on Monday, the 28th May—to the best of my recollection the place was fastened up—I don't remember coming in and seeing you at work—I have a very great many things to think of; I have stated the evidence to the best of my recollection, and as far as remember the place was closed and I did not see you on that day—I enquired about you there, and I was told that you had had a quarrel with a man and had been kicked down stairs; a man named Wade told me that—I believe that was about five o'clock—I did not go to your place any more that evening—I went there again on Tuesday evening about six o'clock, the place was fastened up and I saw nothing until one of the work people broke away part of the fastening of the doors, and when I went into the place I found the work had been violently removed, and that the leads had been cut away from the machine—I would swear that 4,200 were cut away—they were all taken away—there were 5,200 leads—you could not work with one less than that number—they were all gone except a few that were found on the floor—I am not able to say what the market price of the leads is per thousand—your place was safe enough when I saw you there at work on Saturday the 26th May—that was the last time I saw you there at work—I found only a small quantity of silk waste—the forty yards of silk that I gave you was violet and the other colour was nankeen—there was forty yards of violet and twenty yards</p>

I took the prisoner in custody at Hulseworth in Suffolk, on 14th June—I showed him the warrant and said I should take him for stealing silk from Mr. Vavasseur's—he was in custody when I got there—I received him from the superintendent of police—in the railway carriage he said, "I knew I was very foolish for doing this so I gave myself up; I have sold the property in question to a man whom they call 'Crutchy,' whom I met in the City-road"—I said, "Did you give it him"—he said, "No; I gave him leave to cut it from the loom"—I said, "As to the weights, do you know anything about them?"—he said, "No; I did not give him leave to cut the weights away."</p>

"I told him the day and he said, "I can find you something better than that when it is done." When I had the scarfs done I went to him; he took me to a house and showed me a room in Golden-lane, which he said he would let to me for 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; he afterwards took me to a much worse room and I had to pay 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week for that.

               <p>John's-street, Clerkenwell—on 4th July, about half-past 8, I was walking alone in West-street, Smithfield; there was a fire there and I stopped to look on—whilst there I felt my watch chain dragged—it was round my neck—I had seen my watch safe about 10 minutes before—it was attached to a chain by a small ring—upon turning round I saw the prisoner—I am quite certain he is the man; he had got the chain passed through his hand, and the watch appeared to drop from his hand—the wire of the ring was broken, but the watch had not come quite out, it was ready to drop out—I laid hold of him directly—a policeman came up and I gave him into custody—he was taken on the spot.</p>

I am a widow, residing at 41, Fitzroy-square—on Monday, 18th June, I was in the City, and about half-past 11 I got into an omnibus at the Mansion-house to return to Regent-circus—it was quite empty when I got in—I seated myself at the upper end on the left hand side—I had occasion to take out my purse in Leadenhall-street; that might be about 5 minutes before I got into the omnibus, but not more—the prisoner was the next person that got in—she seated herself close by me. on the same seat—I had a paper that I was reading—a young man afterwards got into the omnibus; he seated himself close by the door—nothing occurred in the course of the journey which attracted my attention—the omnibus stopped first in Newgate-street, very near Newgate market—the prisoner got out—I immediately thought of my purse, looked for it and found it was gone—it had been in this side pocket—I got out of the omnibus as soon as I could get it stopped, and went along Wood-street in the direction I thought the prisoner had taken—I did not find her there—I returned, and in returning along Newgate market I saw her—I ran towards her—she immediately disappeared—when I came to the corner where I saw her go from, I inquired of a butcher which way she went, and he directed me—I next saw the prisoner in Fleet-lane, leading out of the Old Bailey, in custody—I said, "You have robbed me"—she said, <hi rend="italic">"No"</hi>, I have not; what had you</p>

I live at 120, Old-street, and am a tailor—the house is my dwelling house—on the morning of 15th June, about 4 o'clock, I was awoke by a crash—I went down stairs—the previous evening, between 10 and 11 o'clock, I fastened the back-room window and bolted it, and the door also—there is an outside shutter to the back-parlour window that was properly secured; when I came down I found the shutter broken and the window open—I had a chest of drawers in the parlour—I left them in the usual order the night before—amongst other things I left a pair of trousers there, they were laid across the drawers outside; they were not taken away—I found a chisel on the table—the glass of the parlour-door, which leads to the shop, was broken—that I believe awoke me—the house is in the parish of St. Luke—I missed nothing except the kitchen door key; we have not found that yet.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Murphy's Defence.</hi> I wish to draw your attention, gentlemen, to the statements of the constables, Smith and Martin. Smith, at the police-court simply says that he saw a man running up a street opposite the Bedford Head; why did not he run after him? he saw no one running after the man, and yet he says there was a cry of "Stop thief;" he did not state that because he did not know the statement Martin was about to make; since then they have put their heads together, and have said, "You must swear that the prisoner Murphy had his boots off and I will say so too; I must say he had his boots off to make my evidence correspond with your's. "Then Martin says there is horse-dung upon the stockings, and Boobyer says there is no horse-dung, but they are only dirty. I can easily account for the dirt; I had bluchers on and they let water. I know nothing about the case; I was not with the other prisoner; I never saw him that night.</p>

I am the wife of Robert Turner of Tottenham, a gardener—on Saturday, 30th June, I went to the Stratford railway-station—I took a ticket there, put it in my purse, and put the purse in my pocket—there were two half-crowns and a key in it—there are some stairs at the station by which you ascend to the platform—when I went up the stairs the two prisoners came up with me; there were some tipsy men below; the prisoners began talking to me going upstairs about the men—Strange was close to my pocket side; Colley was on the other side of Strange—I felt a drag on my dress while they were close to me, as we were going up the stairs—I went to the waiting-room and left them on the top of the stairs—I felt for my purse to put back some change into it, and it was gone—I then ran back directly, and saw the prisoners down below, against the door—I said to Strange, "You went up stairs with me; I have lost my purse;" she said, "No, I did not; I have not been up any stairs"—the porter then asked Strange if she would mind being searched, and she said, "No"—we then went to the station master's room with both the prisoners—I have since seen the purse; this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the key and the half-crowns are in it—the porter brought another purse and asked me if it was mine, and I said, "No"—the prisoners were taken to the station; nothing was found on them, and they were discharged, but on this purse being found, they were taken again.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Brown, a pawnbroker—on 2d May this year, the prisoner came to our shop, with, I believe, a female—he pledged fourteen handkerchiefs, and a silver teaspoon—part of the handkerchiefs belong to the prosecutor; the other part, and the spoon, do not—the prisoner came in the name of "John Francois"—the whole of these articles were pawned by a female—that was the female who came with him on one occasion—there were on 1st July, a shirt, two waistcoats, and a pair of drawers—on 3d July, two pairs of drawers, and a shirt; 13th, calico, and a shirt; 17th August, two shirts, and some silver dessert spoons; 20th August, a coat, sheet, and three shirts—that is the coat that I gave up to the prosecutor—on 3d September, a shirt, two pairs of drawers, a tablecloth, and a fork: 6th September, a Bible; 7th September, four books—those are the books spoken to by the prosecutor—on 12th September, a table-cloth, and several smaller articles: 14th June, 1860, this scarf—I likewise produce some articles of plate, a table-spoon and fork, on 18th May: 20th June, a table-spoon, dessert-spoon, and fork: 5th July, a dessert-spoon: 10th Sep<lb/>tember, a pin: 12th September, a pen-holder, and two pencil-cases; and 6th September, a gold watch, the one that has been spoken to.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gunner in the 8th battalion of the Royal Artillery; the depot brigade—on Sunday, 24th June, about half-past 2 in the morning, I met the two prisoners and another marine, in a street near Woolwich—I had not known them before—I went with them towards Plumstead, and past Plumstead church—we went on to a hill near Welling—being Sunday, there was no public-house open—I found a beer-shop open ultimately, and I treated the prisoners to three pots of beer—I left them—I was proceeding back towards Woolwich—Dougherty was the first that overtook me—he reproached me with having left them without having given them notice—I said I had given them notice—presently afterwards, another marine and the prisoner Johnson came up to me—they walked with me some short distance—I proposed to go through the wood, as a nearer road into Plumstead—after I got up into the fence, I saw there was a deep ravine, and I wished to go back by the road; and Johnson said, "No, certainly not; go through"—I went to the bottom of the ravine, and when I got to the opposite side, Dougherty seized me round the neck, with his left hand in front of my throat, and his right hand behind—the other man seized me round my waist, and they then threw me down—I tried to remonstrate with Dougherty—he said that if I spoke a word, I had not one moment's life in my body—they got me down on the ground—they took my watch and searched my pockets—I only had a trifle left, and I had that in my mouth—my watch was in my pocket, and my watch guard was round my neck—it was a silver chain—I had it safe before these men took hold of me—I saw them take it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my my watch and chain.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Robertson, M'Clean and Robertson, of Falcon Wharf, Blackfriars, lead and glass merchants—the prisoner has been for several years traveller to the firm—his salary last year was 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a-year, and a guinea a day for traveling expenses—we were in every respect satisfied with him—his duty in the course of his journey was to collect money and orders, and to transmit them to us by letters, and on his return he handed me in the book of his receipts—these are some of the letters received during 1859—I should suppose that all the letters advising me of remittances are in this book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)is one of the cash-books kept by the prisoner, and this one also (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on his return from his journey he would hand me this book, which I understood contained a statement of the monies received by him during the time he had been away—I do not go over the book with him; I ascertain its correctness by comparing it with the remittances entered in our cash-book—as the monies arrived they were entered in our cash-book—at the end of each journey he makes up this book, and hands to me the book and the balance shown to be due by his own statement—these are the only books of which I had any knowledge; I had never seen these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)until the prisoner was taken into custody—they were used by him for the purpose of entering his orders and the money as he received them—I believe they were given out by us, but they were never returned to us—we never required the return of any of them, or the iuspection of them at all—it is the custom of our house to require an inspection of them—I have never, from the time of his being with us, seen or had any return made of these books—I have no knowledge of the custom of the trade beyond that of our own house of business—Mr. William Day is a customer of our's—I have no doubt that the prisoner was there at the time—this is the cash-book in which the prisoner accounts to me—I find in it an entry, on 10th February, of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—this (<hi rend="italic">another</hi>) is one of the books for February, 1859—in it it appears, from the prisoner's handwriting, that he has received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it is not under the same date as the other—this appears to be dated 26th January, 1859, at the top of the page—this appears to be all January, but it is the same amount—I find an entry of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from Mr. Day; besides that, there is "9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. discount," as if written in after-wards—he accounted to me for 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. he never mentioned any sum of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. due from Mr. Day, nor any error—the prisoner had a discretion as to the amount of discount to be allowed—Mr. Baines, a plumber, at Cheshunt, is a customer of ours—find in this book an entry, "27th June, 1859, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. received from"—in the memorandum-book, on the same day, it stands, "C. Baines, cash, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; bill at three months, 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.: total, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—</p>

               <p>this is also in his handwriting; it is his private book—in it he enters, at 27th June, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—at the end of the book, in a list of names, I find the name of "Baines, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—this is a ledger, which the prisoner took with him on his journeys, containing a list of all the accounts he had to collect, made up by himself, in his own handwriting; in it the balance at Christmas stands 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as due to us by C. Baines, of Cheshunt—this paper is in the prisoner's handwriting; he was there in March, 1860—this purports to be an account of what Mr. Baines owed to us—the date of it is 6th March, 1860—I find the balance here 53<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the prisoner has never accounted to me for the sums of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I find that the prisoner's cash-book, which he handed to me at those dates, correspond with his letters of advice and remittances.</p>

               <p>no note of the names—I have not inquired whether those are errors or not—I forget the date when I caused the prisoner to be given in custody; you can refer to the deposition—I applied for the warrant myself, but I took no note of the date—I applied for the warrant on 28th April—between that time and last Monday I looked at those books, in some cases, to see what entries the prisoner had made—in this particular case I did not, nor any of those which were tried on Monday, but I sent for those books yesterday, and I then looked at Baines' and Day's—the prisoner had not finished his accounts for this journey; he was on the journey when he was taken in custody—he was not called upon in any way to go through his accounts or to balance the books—this journeyman's cash-book was merely put into my hands, and I looked to see whether it corresponded with the letters of advice—I never called on him to make up his accounts—it is quite possible that he sent up 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the last week of his journey before he was taken in custody; I do not know—he sent up 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day before he was taken into custody, and possibly 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the day before the warrant was taken—I ac<lb/>knowledged the remittance in my usual manner; "Dear Sir," very possibly—when I have complained of a large allowance of discount being made, the prisoner has said he should be happy to go through it—sometimes I have gone through some particular items—I have not, since 1857, been through the accounts with him at all; the book itself is the account—nothing was said, at the time he was given in custody, about two items of eighteen months ago—all he knew about it was that my solicitor sent him notice that he would be tried—100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of his salary is owing to him—since his committal he has brought an action—he was allowed to use his discretion about the discounts—commission would not be allowed to a person who recommended a good customer—supposing that instead of taking a journey to a certain person, the prisoner were to get that person over to where he himself was, he would not be allowed to charge their expenses—at the end of each journey he enters a sum for incidental expenses—I pay those expenses, as expenses incurred by him, and I suppose them to be reasonable; if they were unreasonable I should object—I know nothing of his allowing a person in that way—if it were allowed it would be entered in the incidental expenses—I do not inquire into them; I take it for granted that he has spent the money in some mode for our business—there is always a charge for booking made—in many cases, if the customer complains of the booking, it is allowed to them—in point of fact, it is part of the carriage under another name—we make a charge for carting, under the head of booking—that is not done whether there has been carting or not—if the customer objects, a portion would be taken off; a discretion is allowed to the tra<lb/>veller; and sometimes he might take it all off, in the case of a good cus<lb/>tomer—the prisoner's salary has been gradually increased from 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. up to 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the last increase was some time last year—I wrote to him, and told him that I should increase his salary 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is possible that that was in April; I really do not know, I kept no copy of the letter—I am at the business every day for many hours—I am there from 9 in the morning, and am generally there till 4 or 5 o'clock in the afternoon; every day in the week—sometimes I take a holiday for one or two days—the prisoner has increased his portion of our business considerably—he was a good servant to us; that was why we increased his salary—there have not been very heavy duties for him to perform—we have others who perform as heavy duties, and who perform them equally well—he performed his journeys two or three times a year; some were long and some were short—</p>

               <p>he should usually visit each place three times a year—I really cannot tell you how many places he had to visit; I really do not know whether there were as many as 200—it would be very difficult to answer that question—he went down to the south coast; and north, as far as Norwich—he kept to the eastern coast—I should say he has certainly not been absent on those journeys as many as 360 days out of 365; I am not sure that he has not—sometimes he remained in town two or three days; never less than that—sometimes he remained a week.</p>

I have been able to trace that through the prisoner's books—by his private book, the entry shows that he receives on this journey 4,006<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that is the entry, and 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it is all in the prisoner's writing—he pays to us 3,850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—to make his private book tally with our book in amount, he deducts from that 4,006<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. various sums of money, amounting to 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; deducting that, gives him the amount which he has accounted to me for, 3,850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., so that he actually received 4,006<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and pays to me 3,850<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and I can prove each item; there is the name of a customer of our's to each item—he has never paid to me one shilling of those items, making up the sum of 155<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. nor accounted to me for it in any way—the journey in which Nutt's case is, was completed on 24th December, 1859—subsequently I saw the prisoner, and squared accounts with him—we have a customer named Crowhurst, of Bexhill, Sussex—the first item in this old account is Webb's, of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I am in a condition, by the prisoner's own writing, to trace out that sum, and I will prove that I never received it—though I received the actual bill, by remitting that particular bill, the prisoner was able to keep back 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in money—I have the bill and receipt in Crowhurst's case in my hand; they are both in the prisoner's writing—on 4th February, 1860, he actually received 72<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; here, in the cash-book belonging to the firm, it is 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is an allowance in the bill for discount of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the allowance in his private book is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. would be made up by the 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. less in cash—the pencil book shows 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.,—I have never had that sovereign accounted for—the total in the little book is 71<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the same in the private book—we had a customer named Fiers, of Seaford—this bill and receipt are in the prisoner's writing—it appears by this "By cash 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and a "bill for 76<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on 7th February, 1860, making a total, he received, of 106<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—in the pencil book is "Henry Fiers, 105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>"—in our book "105<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "and discount" 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., "the discount allowed being 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—in the pencil book it originally appears, I think, 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—the difference is to be found in the discount;

               <p>mine, or a policeman in the place—the shop was shut—I walked on the other side of the street first, and Mr. Bird told me that the premises were locked up—I borrowed a crow bar and went to the shop door and en<lb/>deavoured to get in with it—before that I saw the defendant on the side wall, flourishing a stick—he said the first man that went into the house he would break his head with that stick—I said, "I must chance it," and got the bar partly in the door—he then threw part of a brick at me off a fan light above the door—it just touched me and that was all—a second was then thrown, and I do not believe that touched me; but a third did, and struck me very heavily on the eye, and cut my face, and laid my cheek open—the blood flowed—it hurt me, and I was obliged to leave the front door in consequence—I cannot say that I saw the defendant at the fan light—I was close under the door—I was not able to get into the premises—it was about half a brick.</p>

On Friday, 15th June, I was at this house, 81, Vauxhall-street, Lambeth, and saw the prisoner standing on the wall at the rear of the house flourishing a stick in his hand, and saying that any one who attempted to come in he would beat their brains out—I saw Mr. Edens afterwards at the door trying to get in—the defendant was over the door at the fan-light and asked him what he was doing there—he said he was coming in—the defendant said, "If you do not leave off, I will drop this on your head"—that was part of a brick or a stone—Mr. Edens still continued trying to get in, and he dropped it—it hit him on the hat—he then dropped a second which did not hit him, and a third which hit him on the face and caused a wound which bled, and his eye became black—I advised him to come away from the door, and he did so.</p>

Waters and Steel, millers, of Blackfriars, have been in the habit of supplying the workhouse with flour—it was delivered in their own sacks, which, after they were emptied, were fetched away when the other load came—that was the usual custom—they wera fetched by our own carman—on 10th April we had at the workhouse 162 sacks belonging to Messrs. Waters and Steel—on that day I saw the prisoner there—I first saw him on the pavement outside the flour loft door—he then came up the eteps into the loft, and said he came from Messrs. Waters and Steel for some flour sacks—he then began taking them up from the floor and weighing them—during that time I asked him if he was one of Waters and Steel's men—he said he was—there was a horse and cart at the door, and I said to him, "Is that Messrs. Waters and Steel's horse and cart?"—he said, "Yes, it is"—he then went on weighing the sacks till he had finished them—I then said to him, "You are a stranger to me, you may as well sign a receipt for the sacks"—I drew out this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and he signed it—I did not know the prisoner at all—I knew his brother, but I did not know it was his brother till afterwards—he was in the employment of Mr. Ward the flour contractor—he was in the habit of coming with loads of flour—upon this receipt being signed, "Henry Woodman," he took the 162 sacks away—almost all the sacks were branded with the name of Waters and Steel—there might be five or six that were not—I should not have parted with those sacks if I had known that the prisoner was not in the employment of Messrs. Waters and Steel—about a fortnight after this Messrs. Waters and Steel sent for some empty flour sacks—we had about five or six empty sacks which we could not let the prisoner have, as they were full of wheat at the time—inquiries were then made—about six weeks afterwards I went, with an officer named Hudson, to Mr. Weston's—he is what is called a sack collector—when the gate was opened I saw the prisouer in the yard—I said to him, "I suppose you know me again?"—he said, "No, I dou't know that I do; I don't recollect you"—I said, "Don't you recollect coming to Lambeth workhouse for some empty sacks?"—I am not certain then whether he made any answer or not—I then produced the receipt and asked him if he recollected it—he said, it was not his; he did not know anything about it—I am quite sure that he is the man—he did not pay me anything.</p>

Waters and Steel, millers, Holland-street, Blackfriars—they had a contract to supply flour to the Lambeth Workhouse—it expired on 25th March, I think—our men are in the habit of bringing back sacks from that workhouse—I think the contract was for six months, and during all that time they have brought back sacks—I did not authorise the prisoner in any way to fetch them or Mr. Weston—I afterwards sent our own man, and they found that the sacks were gone—the prisoner brought a quantity of sacks on the 11th and 12th—I paid him as from Mr. Weston—he was the collector—I paid the prisoner on the 11th two sums of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and on the 12th 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—two separate lots of 300 each on the 11th, that is 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 78 on the 12th—that is 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on each sack—supposing these 162 to have been among the sacks which the prisoner delivered, I paid 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on each—that is the usual practice—2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is paid to the baker, and there is a halfpenny profit for the collector—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186007090097"/>
               <p>they are supposed to be collected from the bakers—I can't tell whether the sacks from the Lambeth Workhouse were among the 300—the prisoner gave me receipts for these sums of money, signed "Henry Ward"—I believe this signature "Henry Woodman" is the same writing—I know the prisoner as I coming from Mr. Weston—if I had seen the name of Ward on the receipt given at the workhouse I should have known at once to whom it belonged.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long have you known him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He came to Mr. Weston's since last Christmas—Mr. Weston is a collector of our's—we are flour merchants—we have three or four collectors—it is a race between the collectors to get our sacks—each collector is anxious to get as many sacks as he can—when the servant of the collector goes to a baker and gets some sacks, he pays 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for each sack delivered, and in the ordinary course of business he brings the sacks home to his master—a collector at the end of the day may have three or four servants come home with sacks, and they are then all put together—the prisoner had often come from Mr. Weston's—I had paid him money before in the same way for Mr. Weston—we might have a thousand sacks come in on Saturday—we always have more at the end of the week—there was nothing suspicions in the number that the prisoner brought—we are in the habit of paying as soon as they come in.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father who carries on business as a sack collector—the prisoner is in our employment—he collects sacks for my father occasionally—the custom was to bring them in, and we paid him money upon them—on 18th April he brought in 300 sacks—we paid him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on each sack—he said nothing to me about bringing the sacks from Lambeth workhouse, if he had I should not have paid him 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each—I gave him no directions to go there—the sacks that he brought were sent to Waters and Steel the next day, and we received a halfpenny each upon them—we gave the prisoner a shilling a hundred on the sacks—besides that we paid him 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week.</p>

I have been for some years employed as a senior clerk in the General Post Office—the prisoner was a letter carrier employed in the Southern district, Westminster Bridge Road—on 28th June I made up what is called a test letter, in which I enclosed two half sovereigns, fastened in slits on a card, in the ordinary way, and secured them with some adhesive paper—I addressed the letter to Miss Huggett, 70, Charlotte-terrace, Blackfriars Road—that was a real direction—there is a Miss Huggett of the age of seven years, I believe—I gave the letter to Willis Clare, one of the inspectors of letter carriers, with directions to post it, at the Southern district office—Mr. Huggett had been previously communicated with, and the letter, if posted should have arrived at that address, about 2 o'clock—in consequence of information which I received, I went to the Southern district office about half past 4, when the prisoner would return from his 4 o'clock delivery—he was brought to me in a private room, and I asked him what walk he was on—he said Stamford-street—I said, "Did you make the one o'clock delivery on that walk to-day?"—he said, "Yes, I did"—I asked him if Charlotte-terrace was in his delivery—he said, "Yes"—I asked him if he knew anything of a money letter addressed to Miss Huggett, 70 Charlotte terrace—he said, "I do not; I know Huggett's very well; they I keep a coffee shop"—I directed Bingham, a policeman who was with me, to search the prisoner, and saw Bingham take from the prisoner's pocket 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

               <p>in silver and some copper money, and the piece of card in which I had enclosed the half sovereigns, but no gold—I asked the prisoner where he got the card from—he said, "I do not know"—I said, "Then I will tell you where it came from; it came out of the letter addressed to Miss Huggett"—I this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—here is my initial "G" on it—I cut that piece of card from this other piece, which I now produce—the writing is continued from the one piece to the other—it is lithographed I think; and besides that, I here is my private mark on the card and also the officer's initials—here are the marks on it where the money has been placed in, and here is a portion of the adhesive paper—I gave the prisoner in custody—the money I enclosed was the money of the Postmaster General—I believe a letter becomes his property when once posted.</p>

I have been in the force seven years—I was on duty at the Crystal Palace, on Saturday, 9th June, in plain clothes—I had three constables under me; they were also in plain clothes—there was a fancy-fair there that day, for the Warehousemen's and Clerks' Schools—there was a great number of people there—the fair was held in the centre transept, in the large open part, in the centre of the place, right opposite the great orchestra—I know Lady Emily Peel's stall—it was on the right as your back was towards the grand orchestra—the fair was before you—there were two openings to the fair, one to the right and the other to the left—Lady Peel's stall was at the further end of the right-hand entrance—I saw the prisoner that day—I first saw her about ten minutes or</p>

               <p>a quarter after 4—I saw her in front of Lady Peel's stall—from the manner in which I saw her moving about, ✗ her, and watched her—I saw her go up to the stall, and, after looking at several articles, she took hold of this D'oyley, which was pinned to the stall—she drew the pin out, and on a lady coming round in front of the stall to replace some articles, she hap<lb/>pened to come close up to the left hand side of the prisoner, and the prisoner replaced the pin again in the D'oyley, and attached it to the stall, and as soon as the lady had turned her back to go round the counter again the pri<lb/>soner took the pin out, and took the article, crumpled it up in both her hands, placed it somewhere in front of her dress, and, turning round, she walked about ten or a dozen yards, and on returning again to near the centre of the stall, there were two or three pairs of gloves or mittens—the prisoner then took this pair and placed them in her dress in the same manner as the D'oyley, and I believe in the same place—she then turned round and walked towards the orchestra—when she arrived at the outside of the fair, she took a piece of paper from her reticule, and in the piece of paper she rolled these articles up, and put them in her reticule—she then turned towards the north end, and I spoke to Stephen Baldwin, whom I found just outside the fair—he had been with me before, but we had left each other about a quarter of an hour before—he was not watching with me—I spoke to him, and directed him to follow me, and we went up to the prisoner—I stopped her, tapping her on the shoulder—this is the article I spoke of; this is not the piece of paper; this is the reticule—I had seen her take a piece of paper from her reticule, roll the articles in it, and place the paper in the reticule after she had rolled up the articles—when I went up to her, I asked her what she had got in the reticule—she said, "What I have got there is my own property"—she had not taken them out of the reticule then—I said, "Where did you get them from"—she said, "I bought them"—I asked her where, and she said, "In the bazaar"—I told her I was a sergeant of police, and she must consider herself in my custody—I said, "You could not have bought them, I saw you take them off a stall; come back, and show me the stall where you did buy them"—she said, "For God's sake don't take me back; I will tell you the truth about them"—I said, "What is that? you have told me one story"—she said, "I picked them up there" pointing to a spot within about twelve feet from where she was standing—I said, "You could not have picked them up there, for I saw you myself take this from off the stall of Lady Emily Peel"—she then said, "O, my God, what shall I do? I will give you any amount of money if you don't take me—I will leave you my gold watch and chain for the worth of the articles"—I said I could not take anything; I must do my duty, and take her to the station, which I did—Baldwin heard the conversation, every word—he went to the station with me—when I saw the prisoner unpin this article it was on the left-hand corner of the stall—the prisoner was between 40 or 50 yards from that stall when I stopped her—I had never lost sight of her during that time—she did not pick up anything while I was following her—she never stooped from the time she left the stall, until the time I took hold of her—I am quite sure that there was no one at that part of Lady Emily Peel's stall who could have shown her the things—I took the prisoner to the station, and then to the Norwood station—I took the reticule from her and opened it in the palace—I found these articles rolled up in paper in the reticule—when she was taken to the station there was a gold watch and chain found—the chain was on her neck and the watch was in her pocket—I saw a purse with two shil<lb/>lings, a sixpence, and two railway tickets in the porte-monnaie—that was all the money I saw—she gave her name and address correctly.</p>

               <p>about 9; I have not seen him again—I saw the prisoner so close that I could not make a mistake—I don't believe I have made one or two mistakes as to the mode in which she took the property—I had said on the first examination that the article was pinned, and I was asked by Mr. Elliott, the Magistrate, to describe exactly what I saw—I have no recollection of saying that I wanted to amend my evidence—I believe I did not say I wanted to add to my evidence or to amend it—I will not swear I did not ask to be permitted to amend my evidence—on the first occasion I said I saw her take it, and Mr. Perry, the Magistrate's clerk, said, "How did she take it"—I said by unpinniug it—the statement I wanted to correct was that I saw her take it—I said that without mentioning the pinning or unpinning at the moment—I did not say I saw her snatch it—it was about half way through the case that I asked to be permitted to correct my statement—Lady Emily Peel was not examined on the first occasion—I was asked on the first occasion why I did not mention the unpinning before—I have no recollection of asking on the second examination to be allowed to correct my evidence—I won't swear I did not—I did not pull her purse out of the reticule before I got to the station—I did not take the purse out at any place; she gave it me out—I said, "Have you not got anything else in your pocket"—it was in her reticule at the orchestra, and she took it out of the reticule and put it into her pocket—I know it was in her reticule because I saw her take it out—she afterwards gave it me out of her pocket at the Crystal Palace station—I said the reticule contained a greasy piece of paper and a purse—I meant that it was taken out at the Crystal Palace—when she took the purse out I did not say, "I know who that purse belongs to; it belongs to some one else"—I did not say I knew who it belonged to—I did not know that it was not her own property—I did not say I knew to whom it belonged—it was at the Norwood station that the gentleman came in who told me about the purse—the gentleman was not confronted with the prisoner—Sergeant Marsh heard the gentleman make that statement, I believe—I believe Baldwin heard it; he was near enough—I did not say to the inspector "Here she is; we have got her at last"—we went into a private room at the palace—I examined her handkerchief; I did not make any charge about that because her name was on it—she was handed to the female searcher at the Norwood station—I did not say to the female searcher, "I know she has several purses about her; for I have seen her pick several pockets"—I did not say I knew she had several purses upon her—I did tell her in Sergeant Marsh's presence to be careful, as from the manner I had seen her moving about the crowd I suspected she had got some other things about her—I never mentioned watches neither in presence of the female searcher nor Marsh—in alluding to her own watch I might have mentioned something about a watch, but not of her stealing a watch—I said to Marsh "She offered me her watch and her chain and her earrings"—and she offered them to Marsh also—I swear I heard her offer them to Marsh—I might have said "She may have other purses about her"—to the best of my recollection I did not—I don't believe that I said she had several other purses—Marsh was of the same opinion as myself; he told the female searcher to be very careful—I never mentioned a word about the purse till the gentleman told me about his niece—I don't believe I said in presence of the female searcher and Marsh that she had other purses about her—I don't believe I did or that I did not—I can't say one way or the other.</p>

Q.</hi> Had you the custody of these things? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we were selling them on behalf of a charity—that was the only D'oyley we had of that pattern—I believe it was marked at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; that is merely a fancy price—I did not price them; the Committee did that—I know, as a matter of fact, that this was not sold at my stall—I know that from what the other ladies told me at the time—I had no reason to know it was sold—some articles had fallen from the stall at an earlier part of the day, before I pinned this up, but no articles after that that I am aware of—there were articles of much greater value than these at the stall; there were cushions, purses, pocket-books and smoking caps; articles which women could tell at once, were of much greater value than these—it is not at all by my desire that this person is prosecuted—I really do not know what these are; they are called washing gloves, I believe—they are not very valuable—they are made by the children.</p>
