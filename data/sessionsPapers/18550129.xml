                  </hi>. I am a cooper by trade, and live in Shorter's rents, Whitechapel. On the night of the last day of the year, I was going up Keate's court, Whitechapel, about half-past 8 o'clock; it is near Spital<lb/>fields-church, about five minutes' walk from where I live—I had met a young woman from Limerick, who I have known for the last five years, and I went with her to her place—she lived in that court—I went through the court, and went up stairs with her—I then left her—she stopped up stairs, and I went down and stood at the door waiting for her to come down—it was her own place, but I expect it was a bad place—I went three steps from the door, and saw these three gentlemen (<hi rend="italic">the three prisoners</hi>) in the passage of a house opposite—I knew them before by sight; Rogers for the last two years, Bedborough for ten or eleven months, and Merritt for about three years—there is one gas lamp in the court—I was as sober as I am now—the prisoners sprang from the opposite door as I came from the doorway—Rogers caught me by the neck on one side, and Merritt caught me by the neck on the other side—I did very well with those two <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi>, but Bedborough sprang on the back of my neck, put his two knees in my back, and pulled me down on the flat of my back in the court, and pulled the buttons right off my waistcoat—I called out "Murder!" and "Robbery!"—they took my watch from me before they knocked me down; when the third fellow sprang on my back—it was Rogers that took my watch—it</p>

               <p>was a silver one, engine turned, capped and jewelled; it had a silver chain to it, and a gold key—I am sure I had my watch safe when I came down stairs—I had hold of it in my hand as I came down stairs—the chain was in my hand, and the watch in my pocket—I had hold of it to keep it clear of these men—I cannot say whether the chain was broken; it was not a guard chain, only a chain about eight inches long—it was not fastened; it went in between my buttons—the watch, chain, and key were attached together—when I called out "Murder!" they ran away as fast as they could through the court—I went straight to Leman-street station—the young woman did not come down stairs before I was knocked down—I saw the prisoners, Rogers and Merritt, in custody at half-past 1 o'clock that same morning—I am certain they are two of the men—I saw Bedborough, I think it was at half-past 5 o'clock in the morning, with the officer—he was in bed—I am certain he is the other man.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, H</hi> 76). I received information from the prosecutor on 31st December, about five minutes before 10 o'clock at night, at the station, in consequence of which I apprehended the prisoners—I first took Rogers about a quarter past 12 o'clock; he was walking down Keate-street alone, within about 100 yards of the court where this happened—I do not know where he lives—he asked me what I took him for; I said on suspicion of stealing a watch—he" said he knew nothing about it—I took Merritt about a quarter of an hour afterwards—I went to the house where he lived with his mother, and when I came out of the house I met him—he asked what it was for; I said on suspicion of stealing a watch—he said, "It was not me"—the prosecutor had given me a description of the men—I took Bedborough about an hour and a half afterwards; he was at home in bed, at No. 1, Keate-street—I told him what it was for; he said he knew nothing about it; he was not there—I remember the prosecutor coming to the station when Rogers and Merritt were there; that was about a quarter past 1 o'clock—they were shown to him—there were several other parties at the station—I told him to go in and see if he could identify any of those as the men who had robbed him of his watch, and he first picked out Rogers and then Merritt—he picked them out from others—there were three others—they were three civilians—I do not know whether they were prisoners; there were charges against them at the time—the prisoners were not standing by themselves; they were all standing together, with their faces towards the door—I told the prosecutor to go in and see if any of those were the men that had robbed him of his watch—he went in, and immediately he got inside the door he said, "That is the one that seized me first," pointing to Rogers, and "That is the one that seized me second," pointing to Merritt—Rogers said he must be a bad one to want to <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> them for that, and Merritt said he must be a bad man to lock them up for it—the prosecutor went with me to Bedborough—I told Bedborough to dress himself—he said, "What for?"—I said on suspicion of a watch—he said, "What, for that <hi rend="italic">souper</hi> up the court?"—I understood <hi rend="italic">souper</hi> to mean a watch; it is a slang phrase for a watch—I then called the prosecutor up stairs to see if he was the man, and directly he entered the</p>

               <p>door he said, "That is the man that put his knees in my back, and seized me by the throat behind"—I searched the prisoners, but found nothing on them—I have known them about twelve months.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">At this period of the case, Joseph Mate, one of the Jury, was taken ill; Mr. F. J. Dent, a surgeon, having attended the gentleman, deposed upon oath that he was suffering from premonitory symptoms of delirium tremens, and was unable to resume his duty. The Jury were then discharged from giving any verdict. Joseph Surr was substituted as a Juror instead of Mr. Mate, the whole Jury were re-sworn, and the prisoners again given in charge. The evidence already given was then read over to the witnesses, who stated that it was correct. Mr. Payne held the depositions for the Court, and Mr. Clarkson appeared for the prisoners upon the second occasion.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>. I am the proprietor of Trigg's Wharf, Upper Thames-street, and have also a stand at each Corn Exchange; lam a corn merchant and wharfinger. Liddiard and Mark Ing were in my employment up to their apprehension, which was on a Saturday, the third week in Nov., I think—I know Jesse Ing; he is, I believe, a brother of Mark Ing, and is a corn dealer, he has been so rather less than two years—a man named Hayward was in my employ, and was apprehended on the same day as Mark Ing and Liddiard; he was afterwards examined as a witness against the others—Hayward was the first taken into custody; that was in consequence of something which Mr. Wall, one of my clerks, told me—Hayward made a statement to me, in consequence of which I ordered Mark Ing and Liddi<lb/>ard, who were on the premises, to be taken—when Liddiard was brought down, I told him I was informed that he had been robbing me—he said, "I have not; I have merely sold a few sweepings" (I never allow sweepings of flour to be sold)—I said, "It is useless for you to deny it, Hayward is in the next room) and has confessed to the system of robbery that has been</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290010"/>
               <p>going on"—he then said, "I am sorry, it is true"—(I had made him no pro<lb/>mise, nor had I told him that it would be better for him to confess)—he said, "I am sorry, it is true; I was instigated to do it by Mark Ing, who told me that it had been going on before, and had not been found out, and would not be found out now"—I then gave him into custody, and sent for Mark Ing—I told him I found that he had been robbing me, that he was the worst of the lot, and that I should prosecute him—he said, two or three times over, "I know nothing at all about it"—I gave him into custody—. my practice with reference to the delivery of goods is to send from Mark-lane one of these printed orders (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), addressed to the super<lb/>intendent of the wharf, Mr. Cook—my servants have no authority, in the first instance, to deliver goods upon a delivery order, but if an order is lodged for a large parcel, the person in whose favour the order is made may afterwards draw any portion which is still undelivered, upon his own order alone—that order would be a warrant to my servant to deliver the rest, according to the wish of the purchaser; but each time when they fetched it, the buyer's servant, or carman, would sign one of these notes, and take away the duplicate—the receipt notes are kept in a book; my servants would fill in the name of the house, and the carman would sign the name underneath, and copy the duplicate—it was Liddiard's duty to fill up the ticket, and it would then be given to the buyer's servant, showing what goods are taken and what left—the counterfoil is not signed, the name is merely filled in, and it is retained in the book—the ticket merely shows the quantity delivered; it is Mr. Cook's duty to post it through the stock book from the counterfoil into the ledger every night, or the next morning, and to endorse the buyer's order with the quantity which appears in the book—the purchaser's order remains on a file in the counting house until the delivery is completed, and then it is placed on another file with the completed orders—though the order is addressed to the superintendent, Liddiard would have authority to deliver to that order—he knew that per<lb/>fectly well; he was the working foreman—Mark Ing was also perfectly aware of that practice—he had been six years in my employment—he was recommended to me by his brother, the prisoner Jesse, who, at that time, was a weekly servant to me, a carman, and he had been in the habit of coming to my wharf, as carman, for the last fifteen years—Jesse Ing was never a customer of mine—I did not sell two barrels of flour to him about 11th Aug., nor did I authorise anybody else to do so, or give any delivery order to anybody for the delivery of two barrels of flour to Jesse Ing, or authorise anybody to do so—the right time for my men to come to the warehouse is 6 o'clock, but I think they come from half-past 6 to a quarter to 7 o'clock—the watchman leaves at 7 o'clock—the clerks come at half past 9 or 10 o'clock—I know Liddiard's writing—I have searched the file of delivery orders with reference to goods supplied to Jesse Ing, and find none—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) came by post on a Monday evening, either the last day of the old year or the first of the new—it is in Liddiard's writing—I had another party, named Whitwell, in my employ in Aug., who was authorised to give delivery orders, as well as the two clerks and myself—it was the prisoner's duty, on the receipt of a delivery order, to give the quantity mentioned in the order, or a smaller quantity—the book is not here (<hi rend="italic">it was ordered to be sent for</hi>).—(<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>—"Newgate, Saturday. Dear Sir,—It is with sorrow that I am addressing you now. I should have spoken to you on Tuesday last, but my spirits would not allow me to do so.

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live at No. 1, Bates-buildings, Hoxton. At Christmas last, I was minding the house of my niece, Miss Swift, that is called Middleton-lodge, Dalston—the prisoner was living there as servant—on 28th Dec., there was no one in the house but me and her—about 8 or 9 o'clock that evening, she complained to me of illness; she said she had got a very bad pain all round her—I gave her a little penny-royal and gin—she then went to bed—I had not perceived before, from her personal appearance, anything indicating that she was with child—at 1 o'clock in the morning I went to her room—she was in bed—she still complained of pains in her inside, and I gave her a little more of what I had given her before; she took it—she then said she felt a little more comfortable—I then left her, and went to my bed—I did not sleep in the same room—about 6 o'clock on the same morning I went to her again; I thought perhaps she might want something, as I heard a little noise—she was then in bed—I had a light with me—I saw a lot of blood on the carpet, from the door to the bed—on seeing that, I said to the prisoner, "My God! what has been the matter?"—she said, "Don't be frightened, I am all right now"—I did not remain a great while in the room on that occasion—I told her to lie down, and I would get her some breakfast—I went down stairs into the kitchen to get her some—I opened the shutters, and found some blood on the kitchen table—there was no cloth on the table—there was quite a puddle of blood on the table—I also saw some spots of blood on the floor near the table—I got a candle, and followed the spots of blood</p>

               <p>into the coal cellar—you go through a passage from the kitchen to the cellar—it is in front of the house in the area—I went into the coal cellar, and found a bloody cloth and a pair of stockings soaked in blood—I searched the cellar—I moved a box, and behind the box I saw the body of a dead c hild, with the head downwards; it was quite naked—the box was at the left-hand side of the cellar as you go in against the wall, and the body was between the box and the wall—there was a barrel under the box; the box was on the top of the barrel, and the child was stuffed between the barrel and the wall—the box was close against the wall a top of the barrel, and a top of that was the knife board, to heighten it to the prisoner's height to clean the knives, and that was flush against the wall; it touched the wall—I did not take up the body—I immediately sent for Mr. Herring, the surgeon, who has attended the family for years—it was about 10 o'clock when I found the body—it was at 8 o'clock that I went down to get her some breakfast, but I did not find the body till 10 o'clock—I saw the blood in the kitchen when I went down at 8 o'clock, but I did not perceive it immediately—I saw the spots of blood about 8 o'clock—I began to trace the marks directly, but I was a long while finding the child—I was about two hours in tracing the blood, before I found the child in the cellar—I could not find which way to turn, the passage was dark, and I went first to the right, and then to the left, till I could find it—I had no idea of this, but still I thought there was a something wrong—I saw a knife on the kitchen table at the same time I saw the blood; the handle of it was bloody—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—I afterwards gave it to the policeman—the handle was more bloody than it is now, and the blade was a little bloody on the edge.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live at No. 6, Newmarket-place, Dalston. I was sent for on 29th Dec., between 11 and 12 o'clock, to the house of Miss Swift, at Dalston—I saw Mrs. Scott—she showed me a table in the kitchen, upon which was a large pool of blood, about the size of a dinner plate—it was wet—I saw a knife by the side of it, similar to the one produced—it was bloody, both on the handle and blade—the blood on the knife was nearly dry—I observed spots of blood on the floor—I traced them</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290030"/>
               <p>from the table towards the coal house door—I went into the coal cellar—Mrs. Scott pointed out a barrel to me there, standing at the edge of a heap of coals near to the wall—behind the barrel I found the body of a new born infant male child—it was half exposed, with the head downwards, resting on the coals—I took it up and placed it on a napkin on the barrel—I ex<lb/>amined the child, and found that its throat had been cut—it was a large wound, extending from underneath the left ear, across the throat, dividing the blood vessels on the left side and the windpipe—supposing that wound to have been inflicted when the child was alive, it would certainly have caused its death—this knife would have caused such a wound—I afterwards went to the prisoner's room with Mrs. Scott—I found the prisoner in bed—I said to her, "This is a very sad thing, Ann; how could you do so cruel an act?"—her reply was, "Do what, Sir?"—I said, "How could you destroy the poor little creature?"—she made no answer to that—I then said to her, "Did you destroy it to prevent its crying?"—she said, "It did not cry, Sir"—I said, "Where did you do it?"—she said, "Down stairs"—I asked her if she had made any provision for the child in the shape of clothing—she said she had not—I then asked her what had become of the afterbirth—she did not seem to know what I meant—she said she had got nothing more—I then examined her, and found that the afterbirth had not been removed—of course she must have been recently delivered, because the after<lb/>birth had not come—I compared the end of the navel string attached to the child, and the end attached to the afterbirth, and they agreed—I have no doubt that child must have been attached to that afterbirth—the umbi<lb/>lical cord was cut—I should say that would enable me to compare the end better than if it had been torn—the ends decidedly corresponded—I should say from five to six hours had elapsed between the delivery and my finding the body—next day I made a complete examination of the body of the child—I should say that it must certainly have been alive at the time the wound in the throat was inflicted—in wounds made upon a living subject, the edges are always red, everted, or turned out; and there are little spots of coagu<lb/>lated blood from the extremities of the vessels—that would be caused by the coagulation of the blood just before death.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Would not those appearances equally occur after death whilst the circulation continued, as it will do for a short time afterwards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not—my opinion is, that they would not occur as soon as vitality had ceased, it must be within a very few minutes after vitality has ceased for the appearances to be such—it might take place during life, or a very short time after death—my experience will not enable me to say that—it must take place during life, or some very short time afterwards—I should say a very few minutes would be sufficient to do away with the appearances that were presented here.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CAARTEN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you open the body of the child? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did; it was the body of a full grown, mature, healthy child—the lungs were fully inflated, and of a pale pink colour, which would not have been the case had not the child breathed for some little time; the heart was almost entirely emptied of blood—I placed the lungs in water—they were perfectly crepitant or crackling under the fingers when pressed between them, showing the presence of air—every portion of them floated in water when cut—I cut them, I think, into half a dozen separate portions, and each portion perfectly floated—the inference I draw from that is, that the child must have respired some minutes at least.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> With respect to the appearances caused by the cut,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290031"/>
               <p>I gather from you, that those appearances would be presented if the cut had been made either during life, or within some few minutes after death? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Perhaps they might within a few minutes after death—the test to which I subjected the lungs is that which is ordinarily called the hydrostatic test—I have read authors upon medical jurisprudence—I recognise Beck and Taylor as high authorities upon that subject—whether the hydrostatic test proves merely that a child has breathed, or been born alive, is, I believe, a <hi rend="italic">questio vexati</hi>, but I cannot suppose it possible that the lungs can be filled with air unless it be a vital act; the lungs may be inflated with air before the body of the child comes into the world, but still the child is alive—I do not believe that when the head is in the world, and the body in the vagina, respiration may go on sufficiently to inflate the lungs, I mean not to such an extent as I saw—I do not dispute that a child may breathe before the body is completely born; I have known that in my own experience, but not to such a degree as these lungs appeared to me to be inflated—I made the examination about thirty-six hours after the supposed death—I do not think the value of the hydrostatic test is enhanced by its being applied im<lb/>mediately after death—as soon as I saw the wound in the child's throat, my impression was that it had been born alive—I was examined before the Magistrate—I formed the opinion which I have stated here to-day the next day, after I had made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination, and applied the hydro<lb/>static test, and I had formed the same opinion before, as soon as I saw it, and the appearance the wound presented; my opinion was confirmed by the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—this is the first case of alleged infanticide in which I have been professionally concerned—I have been in practice since 1828—I have examined the bodies of a great many children soon after death, who have been prematurely born, in which the lungs have been par<lb/>tially inflated—I do not know whether the hydrostatic test is, in the abstract, a means by which you can determine whether or not a child has been born alive—abstractedly, I do not think it is sufficient, because if the child has not breathed with some force, the whole of the lungs would not be fully inflated—in children that I have assisted to deliver that have died within a short time, say half an hour after delivery, the lungs of which I have examined, not knowing the cause of death, I have never found the lungs so fully inflated; there has always been some large portion that would sink in water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Acquainted as you are with the authorities upon medical jurispru<lb/>dence, will you tell me whether or not you subscribe to this doctrine of Professor Taylor, "The hydrostatic test is no more capable of showing that a child has been born alive or dead, than it is of proving whether it has been murdered or died from natural causes?"<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My own experience would not lead me to believe that—I have never before been engaged professionally in an inquiry of this nature—I cannot pretend to say that the opinion founded on Dr. Taylor's experience is incorrect; I am only bound to give you the result of my own experience—as far as my experience goes, I do dissent from the doctrine there laid down—I am aware that there are other tests made use of in matters of this kind by medical jurists—there is the static test, that of weighing the lungs—I did not make use of that—there is another test, called Pluca's test, but I have never tried it—the hydrostatic test is the only one I have ever applied—(<hi rend="italic">At the suggestion of the</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT, MR. SLEIGH</hi> 
                  <hi rend="italic">read to the witness the whole of the following passage, from p. 387 of Dr. Taylor's work</hi>: "From what has already been stated, as well as from the most simple reflection upon the circumstances accompanying the birth</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290032"/>
               <p>of children, I think it must be evident that the hydrostatic test is no more capable of showing that a child has been born alive or dead, than it is of proving whether it has been murdered or died from natural causes. The majority of those who have made experiments upon this subject, have only pretended to show, by the use of this and other tests, whether or not a child has breathed. They merely serve to furnish, in many cases, good proof of life from the state of the lungs; and slight reflection will render it appa<lb/>rent, that in no case are they susceptible of doing more.")—I do not sub<lb/>scribe to that doctrine—the umbilical cord had been cut—there are certain presentations in which the umbilical cord is twisted round the neck of the child <hi rend="italic">in utero</hi>—there was no ligature round either extremity of the cord—the length of the cord from the <hi rend="italic">umbilicus</hi> of the child was six or eight inches, and that of the <hi rend="italic">placenta</hi> about the same—that is about the ordinary length—where delivery is unaided by professional assistance it is likely to be longer in duration than where professional assistance is at hand—I cannot say whether respiration is then more likely to take place in the vagina—it is barely possible that a child may be more likely to breathe in the vagina; but the majority of children, even in protracted labours, do not breathe until some minutes after they are born—where a delivery is long, the pos<lb/>sibility of breathing in the vagina is greater than where it is short.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and reside now at No. 95, London-road, Southwark; I formerly occupied a beershop, in Middle Grove-street, St. George's-in-the-East. On Wednesday, 13th Dec., the prisoner came to that beer shop, between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening—he called for a glass of ale, and I served him—he asked me if my house was to be disposed of—I told him, yes—I had previously advertised the house for sale in the newspapers—I asked him if he would like to look at the inventory—after looking at it, he went out into the neighbourhood, and looked about—he said he should like to look at the neighbourhood, to see if it was a good one, before he made any to-do about the house—he came back, and I showed him over the house—he said he liked the house very well, and it would just do for him and his son—he asked if I would have anything to drink, and we had a pint of ale between us, which he paid for—he asked how much I would take for the house—I said, "Nothing less than 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said he would not give any more than 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he stuck to that from the time of his coming in until his going out—after some time had elapsed, I told him I would take 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—he said, no, he would not give any more than the 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we finally agreed on 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he then sent my little girl for a quartern of gin, and paid for it—I took a very little of it—he agreed to give me the 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I called in Robert Baker to draw up the agreement, and witness it—this is the agreement Baker drew up—(<hi rend="italic">This being read, the prisoner, described as Joseph Stanley, agreed to take the house of the witness, and pay a deposit of</hi> 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.)—the prisoner signed this "Joseph Stanley" in my presence—he had told me during the conversation that his name was Joseph Stanley, and that he had come from Uxbridge that morning—he said he was a small farmer there—lie said it would do for his son, and he would bring his son next day; if he was not there between 12 and 2 o'clock, he would be at 4 o'clock—he said his son was lately married, and the business would just do for him—I asked him for a deposit of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "No; if I give you a deposit of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I shall leave myself without money; I will leave you a deposit of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I will return to you to-morrow, as I mean to do business"—I afterwards agreed with him for a deposit of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—while the inventory was being written out, he handed me a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note to be changed, in order to make the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit—I asked him to write his name on the note, and he wrote on it, "Joseph Stanley," in my presence—this is the note (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took it to a neighbour, Mr. Smith, a grocer, to get it changed, and I wrote my name on it in Mr. Smith's shop—when I got back to my house I put the money down on the table—the whole of the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in silver—the prisoner picked up 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and left 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the table for me—he then said if he did not make haste he should be too late for the <hi rend="italic">bus</hi>—he said he wanted to go to Paddington—whilst he was reaching over his hand to take up the money, I noticed his hand, and noticed that the top part of his finger was off—as he went away, he said he should be to his time appointed next day—he seemed to be in a very great hurry to be off after he had got the</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary to the Electric Telegraph Company, in Lothbury. The prisoner was in the employ of the company in Sept., Oct., and Dec. last—in Sept. last, I received a written application from Mr. Harrison—I have it in my hand—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>, "Sir,—I sent a message to Weston-super-Mare, to Miss Harrison; I paid 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the message; I was informed that she had paid 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. must be returned"—on receipt of this I caused inquiries to be made, and I found Mr. Harrison was entitled to the sum of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I instructed the prisoner to write a letter to Mr. Harrison; he did not write it in my presence—I saw the letter after it was written, he brought it to me and I signed it—I hold the letter in my hand—it refers to an order, which I hold in my hand—an order for the payment of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., from the company to Mr. Harrison—the order was made out by the prisoner, and signed by myself—having signed the letter, and order—the prisoner's duty was to copy the letter in a book for that purpose, and to put the letter and order in an envelope, and give it to the person whose absolute duty it was to send the letters to the post—having put it in the envelope I fastened it, and it was the prisoner's duty to pass it to another clerk to pass it to the post office—there is a drawer in the office of which the prisoner had the use, and of which he had the key—I know of no other key to it—it was a drawer for the prisoner's use—I believe there was no other communication from Mr. Harrison—the original application was dated in Sept., I cannot tell the date—the letter written by the company to Mr. Harrison, was on the 2nd of Sept.—in consequence of something that took place I made inquiries, and about the the latter end of Dec. I found accidentally the letter which I directed the prisoner to send—I found it in the drawer in the secretary's office, of which the prisoner had the key—I found also several letters—I found the envelope directed to Mr. Harrison—I have it—there is no post mark on it, and no stamp—it is apparently in the same state as it was at first—the stamp would be put on by the persons who attend to the absolute posting of the letters—the money has been paid to Mr. Harrison since the 2nd of Sept.—I issued the order for it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of police. On the morning of Sun<lb/>day, 21st Jan., I received information respecting Mr. Roberts's farm at Southall, in the precinct of Norwood, in Middlesex—it is called Waxlow Farm—I went there with Sergeant Mansell, and found one window had been broken clean out—the cellar flap had been forced up—that cellar com<lb/>municates with the whole body of the house—the wine cellar door had been forced open, as it appeared, by a crow bar—the hinges were broken off—the lock had been broken off the door of the kitchen and the door was open—I ascertained the nature of the property which had been removed—there were some slight footmarks in the snow leading from the house towards the canal—it was then about 12 o'clock—in consequence of some other informara<lb/>tion, I gave directions to Neave and Mansell to search a boat on the Grand Junction Canal.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police sergeant, T</hi> 1). On Sunday, 21st Jan., I received directions from the last witness, and I went to Paddington with Neave—we arrived at Paddington about 5 o'clock—I think there were about a dozen boats lying in the canal—we went on board a boat called the Highgate—the prisoner and three other men were sitting in the cabin—I asked them whose boat it was—a man of the name of Pope, who ran away, said it was Mr. Tilsley's—I told them I wanted to search the boat, in consequence of a robbery that had taken place during the night near Southall (I was in uniform)—Pope said he knew nothing about it, and he pointed to the pri<lb/>soner,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290039"/>
               <p>and said, "That is the captain"—I do not remember that the prisoner said anything—Pope came out of the cabin and made towards shore—he was going across the other vessels—I told him to stop, and not to run away—he continued going across, and got away—I had not searched the boat at that time—I did afterwards, and found in it 12 planes, 24 centre bits, 1 pair of plyers, 1 chisel, 1 screwdriver, 1 mallet, 3 saws, 1 hammer, 3 copper tea kettles, 1 lantern, 5 brushes, 2 meat covers, 12 bottles of wine, 1 Bible, 1 leg of pork, 1 goose, 1 piece of salt beef, 1 loaf, 1 piece of cheese, 5 half-pounds of butter, 54 pieces of China, 1 candlestick, 3 sheets, 9 table cloths, 36 pieces of linen towels, 2 pillow cases, 7 satin chair covers, 1 roll of satin, 1 dressing gown, 7 cotton chair covers, 7 odd pieces of print, 7 drinking glasses and tumblers, and 4 other glasses—they were all in the cabin—the linen was in a drawer under the bed, the greater portion of it—I think there were some strewed about—I am not aware that any of the articles I first mentioned are used in housebreaking.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, T</hi> 94). I have known the prisoner about two years and a half—he was potboy at Mr. Tilsley's beer shop, at Heston, near Norwood, which is rather over two miles from Waxlow Park—he afterwards worked in Mr. Tilsley's brick field—the last two months he was boating in the <hi rend="italic">Highgate</hi>, one of Mr. Tilsley's boats—Mr. Tilsley, of Heston, who keeps the beer shop, has a brother who is a brick maker—on 21st Jan., I went with the last witness to Paddington—I went on board the <hi rend="italic">Highgate</hi>—I found the prisoner, and Henry Pope, and two others—one was named Collins—I do not know the name of the other—Collins went with the prisoner; he belonged to the boat—Pope went off, and while he was pursued, the other two escaped—the prisoner was the last who came out of the cabin—I was standing near the stern of the boat—I apprehended the prisoner; the other two were too quick for me to stop them—when I seized the prisoner he was not out of the boat; he had got out of the cabin, and seemed as if he was going to turn himself round to get out—the <hi rend="italic">Highgate</hi> and most of the boats were loaded with bricks—I looked in the boat, and saw some property—I asked the prisoner where it came from; he said he did not know—I looked in the cabin, and saw the parts of three copper tea kettles broken in pieces—I said to the prisoner, "What have you done with the goose?"—he said, "You can look in there," pointing to the stern end of the boat—I asked him for the key, and he gave it me—Mansell had not returned at that time—I unlocked the place with the key, and found a dead goose, a leg of pork, some beef, some butter, a lump of cheese, and a half quartern loaf—I set those things upon the cabin, and when the sergeant came back he searched the boat—he found in my presence the things he has mentioned—after we had packed up the things, we took the prisoner to the station and locked him up—Waxlow farm is from three quarters of a mile to a mile from the Canal—the boats stop at Northall Bridge—it is not a stopping station—there is a public house where they can put their horses up.</p>

I will do for you now"—I felt my left arm very hot, put my hand to my arm, and found my hand full of blood—I saw the blade of a knife in the prisoner's right hand—he ran away across the road—I became very faint, and my baby fell down on the ground—I screamed out, and a policeman came—I never saw a knife like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in my husband's possession before.</p>

I am dead"—I left her and went away; I left her standing at the end of the court—she was not leaning against anything, but standing the same as I am now—I left her with a young woman named Donovan—I did not see her again alive—she appeared to be well before she received this blow from the prisoner—she was sober, she had not received any violence from any one whilst she was with me, before the prisoner struck her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the hospital in Gray's Inn-lane. On Sunday morning, 14th Jan., a little after 1 o'clock, the de<lb/>ceased was brought there dead—I afterwards made a post mortem examina<lb/>tion,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290050"/>
               <p>assisted by Mr. Savory—I examined the cavities of the body, the head, the thorax, and the abdomen, and found all the organs healthy, but bloodless—in the cavity of the abdomen, extending from the left side down<lb/>wards to the front, and also into the pelvis, I found a large clot of blood; the portion that I removed weighed about eighteen ounces, but that would not represent the whole; the fluid portion was not included in that—I found a laceration of one of the veins of the spleen, a branch of the splenic vein—I believe the greater portion of the blood, which was evidently venous, came from the splenic vein; but I would not undertake to say that a portion might not have come from some other vessel or vessels, which are very small—considering that all the organs were perfectly healthy, I am not disposed to say that the hemorrhage came from any diseased vessel or organ, but having heard that a blow and kick both had been received, and that they corresponded with the situation of the hemorrhage, and with the lace<lb/>rated vessel, I am induced to believe that the hemorrhage which produced the death, was the result both of the blow and kick—a blow and kick, in such a position, might have produced that injury—I have no doubt that death was caused by that hemorrhage, and I believe that the hemorrhage was caused by violence, as far as the evidence goes—my reason for saying so is because the organs were perfectly healthy—I saw nothing which would naturally, and without some violence, cause such appearances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you examine the external surface of the body? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did, corresponding with the internal hemorrhage—I did not observe there any marks of violence—that is not essential, although it is often found—a vessel may be ruptured from other causes than external violence—I do not think that drinking would have anything to do with the rupture of the vessel; but if she fell on the spot, where the clot was found, I should say that might account for it—a person in the habit of drinking is not more subject to injury from violence than a person of sober habits; there is no connexion whatever between the two—the rupture of that vessel would not be caused by great excitement—vessels of the brain may give way in those who have been accustomed to drink hard, and from excitement, but not a vessel in this situation—we scarcely ever find those vessels diseased so as to produce hemorrhage—it does not always follow that the internal injury is immediately near or under the external violence—it may some<lb/>times be in the opposite direction—I do not think that violence on the right side, in this case; could have been the cause of the rupture of the vessel on the left—a blow on one side of the head might produce its apparent effect on the opposite, but I should say not on the body—I do not see any physical impossibility to it—there was nothing on the external surface to indicate where the blow had been inflicted.</p>

                  </hi>. I formerly lived at No. 7, Weymouth-street, Hackney-road. The prisoner rented the house—it only contained two rooms—the furniture in it was his own—he is the father of the deceased child, Frederick Bull; the mother died in Aug. last, leaving the deceased infant and another child behind; the other child is five years old—I am no relation to the prisoner, or his wife—I was living in the house at the time of his wife's death, and after her death I was placed by the prisoner in charge of the two children—I have not been paid any wages, since the mother's death—I took care of the children for sixteen months before her death—I was not with them at the time this child was born, it was two months old then—it was suckled by the mother until a fortnight before her death—it was not a healthy child, it was a thin weakly sort of child—after the mother's death, I had the entire care of both the children; the other was a girl—the prisoner continued to live in the house, after his wife's death—he used to keep the house himself, on Saturdays—he used to go out to work at 9 o'clock in the morning, and come home between 11 and 12 o'clock at night—before he went out in the morning he used to give me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to get the bread and the butter with—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. every morn<lb/>ing, and 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides, sometimes it was only 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he always left me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and sometimes 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. besides—he sometimes had breakfast at home, that was provided out of the money he gave me—he used not to breakfast every morning, not above three times in a week—I generally provided potatoes for myself and the children with the money he left me, and half a pint of milk for the child—I had as much as I wanted to eat of bread and butter—I had not after that sufficient left to provide for the two children—I gene<lb/>rally provided half a pint of milk for this child, and some rice for all our dinners—I have told the prisoner that I wanted something for the child, and I have got it a powder several times—I have told him that the child would like a bit of meat—I thought it was necessary for the health and support of the child that it should have some meat, but I could not get it out of 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I think I have told him that two or three times—I told him so, because I thought the child was very weak—it used to drink the milk I gave it, it could have drunk more—I have told the prisoner so—he said he used to give me all the money he could—I made those complaints to him up to a short time before the child's death—his answer generally was, that he gave me as much money as he could—a few days before the child's death, the furniture was seized—for a week or two previous to its death it could not eat bread, it continued to drink the milk—it had previously been able to eat bread very heartily—I told the prisoner that the child could no longer eat bread, and he told me to take him to Doctor Baker—I did take him to Doctor Baker; no medical gentleman attended the child just before its death, only Mr. Baker; Mr. Baker did not attend him—it was rather more than a fortnight before his death that I took him to Mr. Baker—I did not take him to any doctor within the last fortnight—during the last fortnight, the child did not appear to be</p>

I was requested to open the body of the deceased, and make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I had never seen it during its life—I found it very much emaciated; I understood it was about a year and seven months old—there was no organic disease in any part of the body—the stomach was empty, the intestines also, and contracted—I could form no absolute opinion what the cause of death was without hearing evidence—I could detect no symptoms of disease whatever—on the left lung there was merely a small tubercle, which had not taken on any diseased action, and therefore was not in any way the cause of death—I have heard the evidence given to-day—I believe half a pint of milk was not sufficient to sustain it in life and health—if it had meat, arrow root and eggs in a continuous order, that would have been sufficient—I have examined the bodies of persons alleged to have died of starvation—I could not positively state what was the cause of the death of this child.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, in the neighbourhood of the Hackney-road. I was called in to examine the body of the deceased child, on 16th Jan—Mr. Burchell had previously made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I examined the viscera with a view to ascertain, if possible, the cause of death—from the emaciated state of the body, and from the emptiness of the viscera, and there being no fatty matter in any of the tissues or organs of the body, I could come to no other probable conclusion than that it was in want, either in quantity or quality, of nutritious food—1 could detect no</p>

               <p>symptoms of organic disease in any part, excepting at the apex of the left lung there was a tubercular deposit, but not developed into disease, and therefore, in my opinion, could be no cause of its death—it is, of course, possible that the child might have died from some natural cause, wholly irrespective of absolute want of food—I am not warranted in speaking posi<lb/>tively—I should say the quantity of milk stated was not sufficient to sustain life for any duration; but having eggs, rice, arrow root, and meat occasionally, it is probable that might not be the decided cause of death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Williams, of No. 7, Quaker-street, Spitalfields. Caroline Haines used to lodge there with me, before this took place—I know the prisoner; he kept company with her, but did not live in the house—on Tuesday, 2nd Jan., about half past 12 o'clock at night, I was in bed in the down stairs room—the prisoner and Caroline Haines came up to the street door, and were quarrelling there some time—Caroline Haines afterwards came into my bedroom, and said that a young man had assaulted her at a public house—the prisoner was at the door and could hear every word, and while she was telling me he came into my room, and said, "It is a lie <hi rend="italic">Bet</hi>, all that she has told you"—she said, "I have told her all the truth, <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>"—he said, "If you say another word, I will cut your throat with a razor"—there was a razor with a fixed wooden handle which I use in my business, lying on the table—he took it up, rushed towards her, and said he would cut her b—y throat; she put her arm across, and it cut her right arm—I did not see what part of her person it was pointed at, as he ran so quick—the wound bled very much—the prisoner then ran out, and I fetched Haines's father—I was not in the house, when the prisoner returned—Haines was taken to the hospital—she had very much aggravated the prisoner, but had not done anything to him—she often aggravated him; he is a very passionate man, and she knows very well that he cannot take aggravation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Willcocks, of No. 26, Mary-street, Hampstead-road. On Monday, 23rd Oct., my husband wrote a letter to the Great Northern Railway Company, in my presence—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>: "Oct. 23rd. Sir,—I wish you to send me 1 1/2 ton of first class coals, as soon as you can. J.

               <p>that length of time, and We should be obliged to purchase, the cheapest way would be to have the best—he said that although there was only 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. differ<lb/>ence in the price, there was 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the quality between Wallsend and Silkstones, and he was sorry he did not call before—I said that if he had, and the coals had been the same, he might have had the order—he said, "They would be precisely the same, for I come direct from the railway; I am an agent of the Great Northern Railway Company"—I said that another time if he was passing, and we wanted coals, he should have the order—he said, "Good morning," and went away—on the following Tuesday, 31st Oct., a ton and a half of coals were brought by James Dark, a carman—he brought these two papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with him—one is an invoice, and the other the vendor's ticket—I paid the carman two guineas—about two hours afterwards I heard some statement, and went to the Railway coal office, and made inquiries, and in consequence of what I heard I went to Bidborough-street, the place named on the ticket which I received—that is in the immediate neighbourhood of the railway—I saw Mrs. King, and as I came away I met King, and asked him who authorised him to send me those coals—I said, "You do not mean to say that I gave you the order last week when you called?"—he paid, "Certainly not; but a young girl, called last evening, and told me to send them"—I said, "I never sent any one to you"—he said, "I certainly received the order, or else I should not have sent them"—I said, "I do not believe that they have come from the railway at all"—he said, "They have, I can assure you, and I should like to see Mr. Willcocks"—I said, "He will be at home this evening at half past 7 o'clock"—he said that he would call at 8 o'clock—I said, "If you do not call, some one shall hall on you"—he said, "You make me laugh," and I left him in the street—he never called—I gave information to the company, and gave a (sample of the coals to Lockerby, the officer, on 28th Nov.—on the second morning after the coals were delivered, Bates came to me and said, "Is Mr. Willcocks at home"; I said, "No, but I am Mrs. Willcocks"—he said, "I have called about some coals from Mrs. King, that were delivered the day before yesterday, and to save any bother about it, Mrs. King has got me to come here to offer to take the coals away"—I said, "I do not think we can allow them to be taken away; we have been to a solicitor about it, and he told us not to let the coals be taken away, or accept of any money"—he said that Mr. King came home the night before beastly drunk, and had broken his arm and damaged his nose; he gave him a dreadful character for drunkenness, and said that it was not out of respect for him, but out of respect for Mrs. King that he came, for he did not wish her to have any trouble with it—he seemed to persuade me very much to let the coals go away—I said that Mr. Willcocks had lost the whole of yesterday, and I could not let the coals go without seeing him, and told him to call again, and I would let him know whether he would let him take them away or not—he went away and came again that evening, and offered 6a. for Mr. Willcocks's loss of time (Mr. Willcocks is a coach wheeler)—I said that it was not likely I should let them go when we should have the lawyer to pay, and the mess of the coals—he said, "I will tell you what I will do, Mrs. Willcocks; I will do it on my own responsibility, I will give you 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as the difference on the coals, which will make 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>." (that was 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. besides the 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.)—I said, "I do not think we can do it, for the solicitor tells us not to make a compromise in any way; if Mr. Willcocks will agree to it, I will call upon you to-morrow morning"—I knew where he lived; I went</p>

               <p>there to see if I could find out who the carman was, and I went to three. shops to see if I could find out who had done business for King—in the afternoon, after he called on me in the morning, I went into the shop, not knowing it was the same, and Bates came into the shop—it was in Seymour-street, they sold potatoes—I am not certain whether they sold greengrocery—Mr. Willcocks afterwards wrote a letter to Mr. King, and Mrs. King came with a waggon for the coals, but on the previous evening, 27th Nov., Mrs. King and Mr. Bates came—they saw Mr. Willcocks first, he opened the door to them; he is here—they made an arrangement to take the coals away, and Mr. Bates in my presence offered to give Mr. Willcocks 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a difference on the coals—I said that they were very bad, and I had said so before—the name of the coals was not mentioned at all—when I said that they were very bad, Bates said that they were not Wallsend, and he offered 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the difference—my husband said, "What do you want to offer me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for now; you offered me 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. before?"—he said that Mr. King had been at such a great expense, that he thought Mr. Willcocks might take the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—my husband agreed to take it, and he was going to make out a receipt for the money, when Bates said, "No, I must have it written down that it is a compromise, that you will not proceed any further in the case"—Mr. Will<lb/>cocks said, no he would not write that—I said, "Take the coals away, I had rather you would do that" he said, "Very well, we will"; and turned round, and said to Mrs. King, "If we take the coals away, they cannot proceed any further"—they said that they would come the next morning at 9 o'clock to take them away, and they did so, and Mrs. King paid 1. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for them; that was at the rate of 28<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton for what was left; we had burned part of them—two carmen took them away, but I do not know them—I could recognise them, they were different men to those that brought them—I have not seen them since—on 2nd Nov. I saw the same man Dark delivering a load of coals at Mr. Veitch's, next door; I called him and had some conversation with him, and I afterwards spoke to Mrs. Veitch on the subject—the sample was taken out on the same day that the coals were taken away—Lockerby came and told us to save a sample, and we did so before the carman took the coals away.</p>

Nov.—I communicated with the Company the same day that the coals came, and about an hour after<lb/>wards, when the coals came that we had ordered from the Company—my husband immediately went to the office, and from there to King's house—I did not go with him, I took the coals in; I did not see King after that; his wife called on Saturday morning with a note which my husband had written to King; he had some conversation; she did not pay me any money then—that was nearly a month after, a few days before King was apprehended, when she came accompanied by Bates—she had been twice before wishing us to take money, and we refused; she came with another man, not Bates—the third time she came with Bates, and he was spokesman on behalf of Mr. King—he told my husband and me that King was keeping out of the way—that it was 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of King's pocket being out of the way; and he could not make his appearance for fear of being tapped on The shoulder, and being told that he was wanted—he did not say what King was out of the way for—Lockerby had called several times before this—.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Martin, who keeps a marine store shop, in South-street, Greenwich. On Saturday, 23rd Dec, I was ironing some linen in the back parlour, about 10 o'clock in the evening—I saw my husband's silver watch on the mantelpiece at that time—the prisoner came through the shop into the parlour, and asked me where my husband was—I said that he was at the greengrocer's round the corner, and if he wanted to see him I would send for him—I sent for him, and the prisoner waited at the shop door, and asked for something to drink—he was in the parlour about five minutes—he placed himself before the fire, and was within reach of the watch—nobody else was in the room—I had sent the child for my husband—I missed the watch about ten minutes after<lb/>wards—I had not left the room since seeing it safe, and nobody but the prisoner had been in.</p>

On Saturday, 23rd Dec., a little child was sent for me—I went to my shop, and met the prisoner by the counter—I had frequently seen him go backwards and forwards past my door—he asked me if I would come and have a drop of something to drink with him—I said, "No"—he said, "Do not go in doors; come and have a drop of something to drink"—I said, "No, thank you; on account of Christmas being so near, I will not have any now"—I went in doors, and in a minute or two missed my watch off the mantelpiece—I went in search of the prisoner, and found him between 11 and 12 o'clock on Sunday morning, and gave him into custody.</p>

I remember the prisoner coming to the shop on 6th Jan.—she asked to look at a bonnet—I showed her some—she selected one, and purchased it—there was another person with her—one of them paid for it—the prisoner then asked for some ribbon—there was one yard of ribbon purchased, which was also paid for, I believe by the other party; I will not be quite positive—the prisoner then asked for some stockings; but after having shown her the ribbons, I missed one piece—I showed her the stockings; but previous to showing her them, I marked how many there were—she did not like them, and I showed her some more; and on putting them away, I found there was one pair gone from each paper, and she had only paid for one pair—I directed one of my young men to get an officer, and I went on showing her some belts and other things—they then wanted ribbons again—I showed them one drawer, and they did not like that—I showed them another, and I missed one piece of ribbon from that drawer—I missed, in all, two pieces of ribbon and one pair of stockings—I was positive about the stockings, because I marked them.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside in Grove street, Camden<lb/>town; I am a carpenter and turner. I know the prisoner—I first saw him about the 12th Sept.—I went then to where he resided, at No. 42, King-street, Wool<lb/>wich—I was first introduced to him by a man of the name of Thompson—the prisoner said to me, "You are the party that wants to go to Australia, are you not?"—I told him I was—he asked me what I was—I told him I was a carpenter and turner—he asked if I was married—I told him I was, and I had three children—he asked me their ages—I told him a little girl six years old next birth day, a little boy three years of age, and another little boy about sixteen months—I asked him if he could get me out—he said, "Oh, yes," and he gave me a printed form—there was nothing done at that time with that form; it was not written on, it was folded up—he asked for a sovereign, and I paid it—nothing further was said with respect to the price at that time—he told me to take that form home, and fill it up accord<lb/>ing to the directions on it, and bring it to him in about a week's time—I filled up that form, and went to him about a week afterwards myself, along with a man of the name of Hindes—I took the printed form which I had filled up, with me—I gave it to the prisoner—he looked at it, and said it was filled up incorrectly, on account of my name—there was a mistake in my name, and he gave me another one to fill up, and said I was to send it down to him as soon as I could—but then there were three of us wished to go, and it was agreed I should act for them—there were three families, myself, my wife, and children; Learmond, and his wife and family; and Hindes and his family—that was mentioned to the prisoner on the second occasion—I mentioned it to him myself—I said, "Now, Sir, let us under<lb/>stand: what have we to pay you to get us out?"(the other persons had had an introduction to him, and he had given them a form the same as me)—I said, "What have we to pay you to get us out?"—he said, "Let me see, how many of you are there going?"—I told him the three families, that was Hindes, and myself, and Learmond—I told him how many there were, and I said, "There was something said about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>"—he considered for half a minute, and he said, "Yes, that will do"—he said, "I would rather treat with you than a good many, and I will look to you for the money"—I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with me, and he said, "You make me up 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. now, and the other 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I obtain for you what is called an approval order, and the other 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when I obtain for you the embarkation order"—I said to him, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid you when I got the form, Learmond has paid you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I paid you myself, and Hindes 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and here are 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which makes 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—previous to paying the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I asked if he had authority to get us out, and he said, "I have sufficient influence to do all I say I will do, and all I promise you"—there were two different papers given me to fill up—this is the last one (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—he could not have the other, because I destroyed that myself—at the time he gave me the second form, he said he had influence to get me out—the form was to be directed to S. Walcott, Esq., Park-street, Westminster—he did not mention the Commissioners, or Park-street, before I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but afterwards—he said that he could send me—he did not say anything about having autho<lb/>rity to receive any money; no more than he said he could do it and he would do it—he did not say he had authority to receive money—I saw him again after the second interview—he said I was to see him again in a week or ten days—I filled up the form and sent it to him by post—I did not post it myself, but this is the form—I saw him again in about a week or ten days, at Woolwich—I always saw him at Woolwich—he told me that my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290085"/>
               <p>paper was right, I should go—I told him I thought I could not go—he said, "Why not?"—I told him I had three children under seven years of age—I he said, "That is all nonsense; I will make that right"—he then turned round and took a memorandum book off the sofa, or some place, and he said, "Mr. Bishop," or "Mr. Bailey has passed you all; you, Learmond, and Hindes, and you are all right."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say anything about the number of persons who were waiting for turns? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—one and another were talking, and I said, "How is it we can get out?" and he said, "If you apply to Park-street, in the ordinary way, you will have to wait your turn of 15,000 or 16,000"—he said if we paid him the money, he would get us out when we pleased—I believe he said that every time—he said it before he got the money—he said, on the first occasion, "Mark down on your paper the time you want to go"—I said I wanted to go about Feb.—he said, "That will do"—he said on the first occasion, "I can get you out any time you want to go "; and he asked me what time, and I said, "February"; and in the course of the same con<lb/>versation he said, "I can get you out any time you want to go"—I believe nothing was said about our having to wait our turn of 15,000 or 16,000 on the first occasion—I believe that was on the second occasion—it was before I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because directly I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. we came away—he told me to destroy the first form—on the bottom of this second form here is, "Wish to embark at the end of Feb., 1855"; that is my wife's writing—the first form was filled up just as this is—I can swear that "Wish to embark at the end of Feb., 1855," was on the first form—I wrote it myself—on the second occa<lb/>sion he said, if we applied to Park-street, we should have to wait our turn of 15,000 or 16,000, and it would take us two years, as all these applica<lb/>tions were before us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What induced you to pay him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was introduced to the prisoner by Thompson.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But what representation of the prisoner was it that induced you to pay that 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He did not represent anything, he only said that he could do it—that was the whole and sole reason—I paid the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., because I knew that he had got other men out, and he said he would get me out in the same way—I took his word for it, and paid him the money—he said he would do all that he promised to do, he would get us out to Adelaide—it was his promise induced me to do it, certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you believe him to be? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A gentleman—I did not at that time believe him to hold any office—I relied on his promise, and his saying he had influence and power to do it, and would do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>for me, he told me they were at Park-street—I told him the papers were not at Park-street—he said it was all d—stuff, he had the power to send us, and he would send us; he had the power to do so, and would do so, in spite of the Commissioners, or anybody—he brought up some papers and said, "I have heard from the Commissioners in Park-street; I shall go up there to-morrow and set this right," and he would come round and fetch us all in a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and take us to Park-street—that was on the Sunday previous to his being apprehended—he did not come and fetch us—I did not see him again till he was in custody—I never paid him the second 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who is Thompson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A working man, a sawyer; he is gone to Australia.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Do you know whether it was through my agency that Thompson went out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I only know what Thompson told me, that you got him out—I came to you with Thompson on the first occasion—it was on that first occasion that I came to you that you gave me the printed form—Thompson did not say in my presence, "This man wishes to go out in a similar manner to what we are going"—you did not point out to me on the form under what regulations persons would be sent out—the form was not opened—I never opened the form till I got home—you did not tell me to read it—you said, "Fill up that form, and bring it down with you in a week's time to me"—I read it when I got home—the form stated under what qualifications or regulations I would be taken out, and that was the reason I pointed out to you respecting the children—I told you I was not qualified, and you told me you could do it—I believe I pointed out that to you every time I saw you, because I had my doubts about it—after I had discovered it, I pointed it out to you, and you told me you would settle that—on the third occasion you told me I was passed—(<hi rend="italic">at the pri<lb/>soner's request the witness's deposition was here read</hi>)—I said on the first occasion that I was not eligible on account of having three children; that was after I had filled up the first paper—when I brought you the first paper I told you that—you took out a memorandum book, and told me Mr. Bailey or Mr. Bishop had passed me—it was an ordinary penny memoran<lb/>dum book—I think it had red covers, but not being sure I did not say so—I know it was an ordinary penny memorandum book.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Your object was to employ me to get you to Australia 1<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My object was to go there—I went to you because I thought you could get me out—I did not know by what means—I took your word for it—you told me you could get me out—I went to you in consequence of what Thompson told me, that you could get me out—that was the reason I went to you—when I stated that my friends had paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I meant that my friends Learmond and Hindes had paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I believe Learmond and Hindes had applied to you previous to my coming—they told me they had been there—when I brought the first form to you, you told me it was incorrectly filled up—I applied to you in the name of Frederick Greenwood and the first form I filled up in the name of Frederick Greenwood—I signed the declaration attached to the form—you looked at me and said, "I thought your name was Hales"—I said, I thought it was no consequence; I was illegitimate—I took my marriage certificate on the second occa<lb/>sion,</p>

               <p>but it was with the first paper that I took back that the name was Greenwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then you took the certificate on the second occasion? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; when I took the form back—on the certificate, the name is "Frederick Greenwood Hales," and in consequence of that, the defendant said my name was incorrect as Frederick Greenwood—I took Greenwood as a Christian name—I had not gone by the name of Frederick Greenwood Hales—I went by the name of Greenwood—my shopmates knowing me by the name of Greenwood, and Thompson knowing me by that name, I was introduced to the prisoner in that name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did you not state to me that you had seen a letter from Mr. Bailey to Thompson, saying that if he did not pay me he could not go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am certain I never did state that to you—I do not believe that I ever did state so—I did to Mr. Bailey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not at my lodging say that you saw a letter from Mr. Bailey to Mr. Daniel Thompson saying, that if he did not pay me he could not go? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say for certainty that I did or did not; I cannot recol<lb/>lect whether I said in course of conversation that I thought you must have great power, for I had seen a letter from Mr. Bailey to Thompson saying, that he could not let him go without he paid you—I do not recollect—when I first had the form, I paid you 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards which made 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I then paid you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on account of the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that was men<lb/>tioned to get us all out—on account of the whole of us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not understand that this was for my expenses and loss of time; going up to town and inquiring? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never understood any-thing of that sort—I gave you the 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get us to Adelaide—I did not know for what services, or how you were to do it—you said you would get us to Adelaide, if we paid you that money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the offer of paying me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. emanate from yourself, or did I demand 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said there was something said about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; you said, "Yes; 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. will do; I will get you out for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—it was about the 12th Sept. I first came to you—I do not know that you stated on the first occasion, that I should have to wait my turn of 15,000 or 16,000—you did on the second occasion, I will swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do I understand you went by the name of Green<lb/>wood amongst your workpeople? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but my certificate was in the name of Hales—my wife's relations found out more than I did, and I was compelled to be married in the name of Hales—I have been married eight years; but I have gone by the name of Greenwood—I was bound appren<lb/>tice in the name of Greenwood, and persons who worked with me knew me by the name of Greenwood; but my wife went by the name of Hales—Hindes and Learmond were workpeople—they knew me by no other name than Greenwood, nor did Thompson.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You have been asked whether you had seen a letter from Mr. Bailey, saying that he would not let Thompson go out, unless he paid the defendant? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was shown me by Thompson—he said, "Look here what I have got from Mr. Bailey," and he showed it me—the name of Bailey was signed to it, saying that if he did not call and pay the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Maturin, he should not go—Thompson told me that Maturin had got him out—my deposition, and what I stated on cross-examination is true to the best of my belief—there may be a little word or two altered—I said, on the second time I showed him the printed form and said I did not think I was eligible, because I had three children under seven—he said, "I can do</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290088"/>
               <p>that," and laughed—he took out a book and said, "Mr. some name has passed you"—the first time he merely gave me the form—I signed the declaration after I had called his attention to the ages of the children, because he said it was all right, he could do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> On the Sunday did I not read to you a letter which I had received from the Commissioners? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You read some long paper—I could not say what was in it—that was on the Sunday previous to your being given into custody—you did produce a letter, and said it was a letter you had had from the Commissioners at Park-street—that was on the Sunday before you were apprehended—you read it, and you read what you repre<lb/>sented as your reply, but I do not know what was in it—I did not read the letter which Thompson told me he received from Mr. Bailey—Thompson came down with a letter in his hand, and said, "Look here, what I have received from Mr. Bailey"—I saw the name of Bailey on it—it was not a form—it was on a small sheet of note paper.</p>

In September I was desirous to emigrate—I saw the defendant at his house, at Woolwich, about 12th Sept.—I was introduced by a person named Thompson—the defendant asked my age, my family, and my occupation—I told him I had a child two months old, and I had a boy nearly three years of age—I said, "Do you think there is any chance of my getting out?"—he said, "Certainly, you are eligible; I will send you out in spite of everything, or else I should not take your money"—there was nothing said that night about the pay he was-to have, but we paid him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Hales and me, the first night—I paid him that, because Thompson had told me before—Thompson was with us—Thompson introduced me—he said, "This is Learmond, the party I told you about"—the prisoner said, "Take a seat"—I sat down, and he asked my age and my family's age—I said, "Am I eligible? can you send me out?"—he said, "Certainly, I will send you out in spite of everything"—he gave me some papers, one form for me and one for Greenwood Hales, and I. paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said, "I will get you out in spite of everything, or else I should not take your money"—I paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290089"/>
               <p>that pound became he told me he had sufficient influence and power to send me out, and he had a brother out there—he said that after I paid the money, and before also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he said it twice? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; he used that word "power," that he had power to send me out, before I paid my money.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> He told you you were eligible; was anything said even if you were not eligible? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he said nothing about that—what induced me to part with my money, was his saying that he had power; and I knew very well that he had power, he was actually getting Thompson and some other fellow workmen of mine away—I only knew at that time that he was getting Thompson away, from what Thompson had told me—I knew it from what Mr. Maturin himself told me, but that was afterwards—I have told you the main substance of what took place on the first occasion—I saw him again about 1st Oct.; that was at Woolwich—I asked him about my approval orders; he said, "They are ready, whenever you are ready with your money"—he said, "Let me know when you are ready"—I told him I would—I had not raised the money then—I did not pay him any money on 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi> Oct.—all the money I paid him was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the first occa<lb/>sion, with my own hand; but Greenwood Hales paid him 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on my account—it was the third time he told me it was through his influence Thompson was sent—I said, if he was not very sure of my getting out, I would not go on with this—he said, "You have got proof of it; I have sent Thompson, and I have sent Marsh, your shopmates."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About 9th Nov.; I asked him for my approval orders—I had expected them before—I told him I was not going to part with my money, without I got my approval orders—I asked him, over again, if there was any chance of my getting out—I said he had put me to great expense and inconvenience, and I wished to know if he had power to send me away—he said, "Certainly, I have the power; you see I have; I sent out your shopmates; I sent Thompson, and I sent Marsh."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> It was Thompson and yourself came to me. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> Yes; Hales was not with us—it was about 12th Sept.—I do not know whether Hales had been then—it was on the very first occasion you told me you had power or influence to take me out, or else you should not have had any money—I did not see you on 9th Nov., in consequence of your sending for me—you never wrote to me at all—I remember stating to you, on that day, that I was perfectly satisfied with what you had dope; but I cannot do so now—I did not go to the Emigration Office on 9th Nov.—I went into Park-street, but not into the office—you did not want me that day.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you not, on one occasion, go with me to the Emigra<lb/>tion Office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; but that was about the 12th or 13th, for my appli<lb/>cation form—you went into the passage, and told me to go up stairs to one Mr. Bishop for my application form—you gave me a note to Mr. Bishop—I went up and delivered the note, and likewise my papers—I saw Mr. Bishop; he took them, and looked at them—you were not there at that time—you told me, if there was anything wrong, you would be over in Fendall's Hotel; I could get you there.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> That is in Palace-yard? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was a difficulty</p>

               <p>about my papers, and I went to Fendall's, and found the defendant there—I said, "Mr. Maturin, Mr. Bishop says I must have more certificates, the certificates of my children and my wife" (the baptismal certificates)—the defendant said, "I will come along with you"—he went back along with me—he went up to Mr. Bishop's office—Mr. Bishop said he did not see any<lb/>thing against me, but it was out of his power, or any other man's, to offer me a passage—I said to the defendant, "I can't get the certificates of my wife and children so quickly as they are wanted"; and he said, "You can make an affidavit of their ages"; and Mr. Bishop said that was perfectly right, that would do as well as my certificates—I was not passed at all—I was told to get these certificates—Mr. Bishop did not say I was eligible; but he said he saw nothing against me, if I got my certificates or the affidavits—he said that neither he nor any other man had got any power to offer me a passage, until the Commissioners had given their consent.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You wished to go in Feb., and I told you I was going to Wales—I told you if your application went in, you would have to go almost immedi<lb/>ately; did you not state to Mr. Bishop you wished to go in Feb.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I do not remember being told about two men, that they would come round in turn, if you sent them in about six weeks' time—I said one day that I came on account of Greenwood Hales, because he had a bad leg.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer—I live in Lea Bourne-road, Camden-town—I was working at Collard's—Hales and Learmond were working there—Thompson had worked there—I sent in an application to the Emigration Office, in Park-street, Westminster, and on 22nd Oct., I received a refusal order—from something I heard, I went on 29th Oct. to No. 42, King-street, Woolwich—I saw the defendant—he first sent his servant to know who it was—after a little waiting, another party came, and the defendant came down—he said to the other party, "Have you got your papers?"—he settled with that man, and then he said to me, "Are you the man that wants to see me"; I said, "Yes; I have come about a passage to Australia"—he asked me where I wanted to go; I told him to Sydney, but I said, "Before we go any further, I wish to state I have applied to Park-street, and received a refusal answer"—I opened the envelope and handed it to him; he took it from me, and laughed at it—he said, "Because there are so many applications, 15,000 or 16,000, there must be some refusals; they must refuse somebody, but you are the very party they want out there, having a wife and no family"—he took the order and said, "I will see into it"—I thanked him and was coming away, and he said, "Do you know what you will have to pay for going to Sydney?" I said, "Yes, 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. according to the regulations—5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the commissioners, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. within fourteen days after my arrival in the colony"—he said, "You had better go to Adelaide; you will only have to pay 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I will give you a letter"; I said I thought it would not suit me so well—he said, "I have a brother there; I have influence"—I declined to go there, and he then</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290091"/>
               <p>said, "You will pay me the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as I have a percentage from the Govern<lb/>ment; 1' I told him I had noticed that nothing was said about paying the money in the form—he said, "Well, I can do nothing in it without the papers and the money; meet me to-morrow morning at my office in Park-street"—previous to my coming away he said, "By-the-by, it will be better to meet me between 1 and 2 o'clock, when the clerks go to lunch at Story's Hotel"; I was to meet him there—I went about a quarter before 1 o'clock, and had my marriage certificate and my wife's certificate—I said I could only raise him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I gave him; he said it was all d—d stuff, and he could do nothing without the remainder of the money, because he had got so many parties their approval and shipping orders, and they had never paid him the money—on 5th Nov. I went to his private house at Woolwich; I paid him 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he gave me a new form—he told me it must be sent directly, as he was going to Wales; I filled it up, and sent it down to his house by post on 8th Nov.—this is the first form (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) that I sent into Park-street; I got a refusal answer to this—this other is the form which I obtained from the prisoner, and sent him by post filled up—I had given him at Storey's-gate, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at Woolwich, because he told me he was authorised to take the to obtain my approval and embarkation orders—if he had not told me he was authorised, I should not have parted with my money; most decidedly not; I work too hard for it—I believed he was authorised by Government—on 12th Nov. I went to him again, and he told me I was passed, and that I must go directly—he told me he had my approval order, and everything ready for me, and I must go directly; I told him I was not ready—he got up and walked about the room, and said, "If you don't go it is not my fault, mind that"—I told him I would be ready when I obtained my orders, and he said, "Send the remainder of the money by Learmond; it will save your losing time"; I sent 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on 13th Nov.—I said to Learmond, "Here is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., don't part with that till you get my orders"—it was in the belief that the defend-ant had the orders, that I sent the money—I parted with everything, and sold every individual thing during that week, because he told me I was to go early in Dec.—I was not able to get my passage, and have never got any of my money back.</p>

               <p>Government for my embarkation order, and you told me you had a per centage, and you were authorised to take the money for Government, because I pointed out the law on the paper—you told me when I brought the papers to Story's-gate that you could do nothing without the money, as so many had gone away without paying, and you mentioned the name of one—I remember coming to you, and you giving me a note to go to Park-street—that was on Sunday, the 26th Nov.—it was directed to Mr. Baynes, Esq.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not say, "If I have got you into a scrape it is all the fault of that little man, Mr. Baynes, for I took care to call him out to know that his name was Baynes, before I gave him your note?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I did not—you said, "I have done wrong in sending you to that fool, Baynes; I ought to have sent you to Bailey, for he has got your papers, and I will make him tremble"—you told me to be particular and give the note to Mr. Baynes—I did not tell you at the Royal Exchange that I had called Mr. Baynes out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you swear solemnly that you did not tell me that you were so particular that you called him out and inquired whether he was Mr. Baynes before you gave him the note? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I asked him if he was Mr. Baynes, and he said he was, before I gave him the note—I do not know the gentleman's name—I think Mr. Kent received the note out of Mr. Baynes' hand, and then Mr. Cooper, and they all came round and read the note—Mr. Cooper and them advised me, after they had read the note, to get my money back, for you had no influence whatever—I told you on the 3rd Dec. that you had no authority whatever to obtain me a passage—you said you had—I said I had learned from Park-street that you had no authority.</p>
               <p>

               <p>a portfolio, and produced a note which he read, but what it contained I do not know—that was on the rd Dec.—he said it came from Mr. Bishop, and it had all our names down—he said, "You see I have got all your names down who have applied at Park-street"—he read, he said, "To show you that I have authority I will read my brief"—he said the note came from Park-street, and they were surprised he was collecting emigrants at Wool<lb/>wich, when he ought to have been at his post in Wales.</p>

               <p>certain persons on cheaper terrace than they can emigrate themselves—we have certain restrictions respecting persons who emigrate; Seamer would not be eligible, country sawyers only are, and he had worked at the City Saw Mills; Seamer's application was to go to New South Wales—here is one of the regulations which was found in the prisoner's lodgings—the emi<lb/>grant must be of those callings most in demand, which, at present, are country mechanics, such as masons, sawyers, wheelwrights, and gardeners; a sawyer in the City Saw Mills would not be eligible—I know the prisoner; on 3rd Oct. he was appointed an agent for collecting emigrants for the county of Carnarvon; he had no authority whatever to procure emigrants from Woolwich; his authority reached to Merionethshire, but would not reach to Woolwich—he applied to be appointed to select emigrants, and this answer was sent him: "Sir, with reference to your application for the appointment of selecting agent, I am directed to state that the Board will be happy to avail themselves of your services for selecting emigrants on the terms inclosed; the district within which your operations are to be carried on is the county of Carnarvon, &amp;c.,"—(<hi rend="italic">A copy of the regulations was here read, relating to the qualifications of persons intending to emigrate.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My lord, I stand before you under the greatest dis<lb/>advantage; in the first place, my case has been placed since the last Session in the hands of a solicitor, and I was under the impression and informed that my brief and the whole of my case has been in the hands of Mr. Clark-son, and I was further informed that Mr. Ballantine and Mr. Clarkson had agreed that my case should come on this day; I paid no attention to this matter, resting sure I was in good hands, I gave myself no concern, but to my great astonishment I was brought up on Monday morning without a brief, or anything, and told that my trial was put off till this day. The wit<lb/>ness has stated that he remarked to me when he brought the form filled up, that he was ineligible on account of the children, and that I told him he had passed; how was it possible for me to tell him that when he knew that the case had not gone up to Park-street? to him, and to every man who applied to me, I gave them the Government form, stating the regulations on which they can be conveyed; they are there informed that they are not to pay any money to any one; they! are informed that no person has any power or authority to grant or promise a passage, except the Commissioners, and they are not to give up their business till they have received the approval of the Commissioners; every man who applied to me was in possession of that; I was cautious in pointing it out; I asked them all if they could read and write, and they had days to look at the form and study, and read it, and therefore they had sense enough to know whether they were doing right in coming to me; I was at the dockyard one day, when a man of the name of Thompson came to me, and said, "I know you are very well connected in Australia; there is one of our men who wishes very much to go out; he is a hardworking man, will you be kind enough to try and get him out? his name is Neale"; I said, "I have no means of getting him out, but if he goes to the Commissioners' Office no doubt he will go"; this man came to me on several occasions, and I said the first time I was in town I would inquire at the Emigration Office; I went and spoke to some one; I have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290096"/>
               <p>no idea who, and I obtained a form and gave it to this man Neale, and I said, "If you will fill it up, if you are eligible, you will go out"; it went to Park-street, and he got an order; for this I received no remuneration; it never entered my head; a few weeks after, Thompson came to me at my lodgings, and said, "I want to speak to you particularly; my brother and three shopmates are very anxious to go out to Australia"; I said, "What nonsense are you talking? if a man has not money to pay, let him go to the Emigration Office"; he said, "They would give you 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., if you could get them off"; he went away, and he came again, and said the men could not leave their work, and they knew if I would undertake it, I could get them off, and they would give me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a piece; I said I would consider it; I con<lb/>sidered whether I was justified in acting as an agent for these persons, and I spoke to others about it, and asked their opinion whether I could act as an agent; the person came a second time, and said, "Will you do it?" I said, "Bring the men here to me," and he said, "Very well"; his brother, Daniel Thompson, Chamberlain, and another came; they said they wished to go as soon as they possibly could; this, I think, was in the early part of Aug.; I had no form, I had nothing of the kind; I went to Park-street, and asked them to give me three forms; these were given, and I brought them down, and gave them to the men.; I desired them to fill them up, and bring them to me, or take them to Park-street; they brought them to me; I told them to take them to Park-street; they took them, and in a few days they came and told me they had received approval orders, and they brought me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and in a few days they received their embarkation "orders; a few days after Taylor brought me his boy, who had been thrown on his hands; he had been: to school, and they were desirous to take him; I came and spoke to Mr. Kent, and he let me have another order; this gained great notoriety; they knew on what terms these persons had gone, and they all came to me from Camden-town and the different suburbs; they all came to me, knowing the advantage they would have in coming to me; knowing that they would get there for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; this was the reason why so many persons sought me; when Hales came to me, he came with Thompson, and he must have had conver<lb/>sation with him, and he must have known what he had said; I said, "I am not going to run about for you without I am paid for it"; he then gave me., 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as be states to you, and he said he would leave that; I said, "I don't want any more money till you get your orders"; in case of any one not going whom I apply for, I return their money; Hales states that he was not to pay me till he received his approval order, and then only a portion, and the remainder when he got his embarkation order; this was my own proposal; this shows that no felonious intention was in my mind; from the confidence which these persons had in me, I might have obtained from them and the numerous persons who applied, a vast amount of money had I chosen to act fraudulently; I had every possible means of leaving the country, and going where I thought proper—having been in the earlier part of my life in the Royal Navy, I had volunteered for the Black Sea, the ships were going out day after day; I might have lined my pockets pretty well, and joined one of the ships in the Mediterranean, or the Black Sea; if I were desirous of remaining at home, my residence was in Wales where my mother and the whole of my family reside; I was anxious to go there and retire for a short while, and then go to the Mediterranean; the whole of our family are known in Carnarvon and Monmouthshire; under these circum<lb/>stances, I applied to the Commissioners to appoint me their agent there; if I had designed to defraud these men, it is not likely should have applied</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290097"/>
               <p>to the Commissioners; I must hare known it would eventually have come to their knowledge; Learmond said to me, "Mr. Maturin, you have always behaved to me as a gentleman; I am perfectly satisfied with what you hare done"; Osborn went with me there, and he expressed himself satisfied; another man was found ineligible, and he said he would like to go to some other place, and afterwards he said he would not go at all; I said, "Very well; I must return your money; I will not retain any man's money that I do not do the business for"; Learmond gave me 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I never saw him again till I was taken; Hales states that I took out a red memorandum book, and told him that Bailey or Bishop had passed him, and when Mr. Pelham held up the only book that was found in my possession, he said that was not the book, it was a red memorandum book that I read to him; now I will prove that I never had such a book in my possession; he stated that Thompson paid me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and subsequently he denied that he said so; afterwards he said that he meant Learmond and Hindes; it is very odd that Thompson should have been there the same day, and yet they should have been there separately; he knows very well that he had only paid 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and on a subsequent occasion he gave me another pound, and that was given me to pay my expenses, and from these persons I received no other sum whatever, neither have I demanded any; when the forms were brought to me they all stated that they did not want to go till Feb., 1855; I said, "What do you come to me now for, when you don't want to go till February? there the forms must lie; I will put them in at the proper time"; I presume that would have been in the latter end of October; I therefore retained the applications till I considered it was a fitting period to send them in; during a conversation I had with one of the officers of the Emigration Office, I said, "If applica<lb/>tions are sent in, what is the usual time they come in?" he said, "It depends very much on the number of applications on the books"; I said, "Persons intending to go in February, when should they come in?" he said, "In about six weeks' time"; I said, "Very well; there are two persons I wish to send out"; Hales states in his evidence that he came to me in consequence of what he heard from Thompson, who told him I could send him out; he says he did not know in what manner I could send him, and that I did not represent that I belonged to the Emigration Office—with respect to the amount offered to me, when they offered me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I told them all I required was to remunerate me for my loss of time and the expenses I was at; I cannot recollect all the conversation, and I am perfectly certain they cannot; with respect to Seamer's evidence, he acknowledges that it was in cones<lb/>quence of what he beard from Thompson that he came to me; now he had applied to Park-street, he knew very well the proper form to go through, he had gone through it, and was unsuccessful; he knew that his other shopmates had got away, and he came to me to obtain my services; it is not likely he would have come to me, a perfect stranger, to get him over to Australia, or to give him advice, without he had known or imagined that I had some influence, and if he paid me I would get over that difficulty; he states that I said, "You know what you will have to pay for going to Sydney, 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. here, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. after you get there"; I said, "You are a very foolish man; you had better go to Adelaide, that is a registered colony; you would do better there"; he said, No, he would rather go where he said; I told him there must be some mistake, which I believed to be so, because on the face of the form it states that sawyers are eligible, and I now request that the Jury may see the form; he says that I said, "I will do nothing for you unless" you pay me, for I have got so many off who have not paid me"; now having</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290098"/>
               <p>told him that, how could he believe that what I received was on the part of Government; these men came to me because they had an idea that I could get them off; when persons applied to me, I said I would inquire for them; I took Seamer's case, because he was out of work, and he said he would be very much obliged to me to get him there; I thought he was a most eligible person; I read the form, and told him that there must be some mistake in his mode of application; I said, "Meet me at Storey's-gate, I will make some inquiries, bring your certificates of your marriage, your birth, and your trade"; he came and spoke to me, and put something in my hand; I could not tell you what it was, for I put it in my pocket with other money; I do not know what it was; I said, "Very well, I will make some inquiries; I will give you a new form"; I gave it him; I told him I was going to Wales, and the sooner he sent it me the better; he sent it by post, but I was taken ill, and was attended by a doctor; that was the reason the application did not go up; as to my saying that I had his approval order, I deny it; he must have been aware that I had not got that order; he knew that I sent a note to Mr. Baynes, and he heard the reply of Mr. Baynes to me, where he says the case would be taken in turn; I intended to have taken his papers in, but I was ill, and not able to do so; when he sent the money by Learmond, I received it; I said I would not get his orders; I would not work for nothing; I was perfectly justified as a private individual to act as an agent for any one that came to me; if a person applies to you, and you think you are able to perform the service, you merely receiving enough to pay your expenses, on an understanding that they are afterwards to pay you for the service that you agree to perform for them, have you not a right to do so; I was not in the employ or payment of the Emigration Commission, nor have I ever received one farthing from them; I had a perfect right to act in the county of Kent; I had been appointed an agent in Wales, but I bad never gone there; I will prove that after my appointment, I gave instructions that no more persons could apply to me on the subject of emigration; I trust you will see that I had no fraudulent intention; thirty-five or forty persons have gone out through me, and they have gone on with their work till the time they were to go, and they are on their way to Australia; Mr. Kent has acknowledged, that several persons have gone out through my recommendation; it has been stated that I have in several cases returned their money; Hales never demanded his money from me, nor did Seamer; all they desired was to get away; when they came to me that Sunday, I read to them the letters from the Board of Commissioners, and my reply; I said, "You see the situation I am in, I can do nothing more, but I am determined to take every man of you to Park-street to see the Commissioners"; that was my intention, but I could not; I was sitting at dinner on Friday, and was taken by the officers; the Commissioners considered that I had acted a fraudulent part if I had received that money, but I stated on what terms I received it; I would have returned the money if I had had time, but I was not permitted to do it; I have been kept here two months; I will now leave my case entirely in your hands, if I have been in error or thoughtless I have borne punish<lb/>ment enough for it; but as for any idea of defrauding one of these men, such a thought never entered my mind; I have been in her Majesty's service, and suffered as no man ever suffered, in the West Indies, and other places; my thought and ideas were of a very different nature to this; could I have obtained access to my papers, I could have shown you what has been my situation and my intentions; when my country required my</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290099"/>
               <p>service, I volunteered to go to service again in the Mediterranean; I obtained this agency to go on with till I went in the spring; I intended to go to Wales to my mother, to stay there till I went away; I trust you will give me every justice, though a great deal of the truth has been concealed from you; though you can see that as Learmond, and Seamer, and Hales gave their evidence, there was a degree of vindictiveness, I believe, to excite compassion on the part of the public; I have nothing more to say, I throw myself on your hands; I firmly believe that whatever verdict you give will be according to conscience, and whether you return me guilty or not guilty, it is the will of God, and I am prepared to meet it.</p>

On 19th Jan., at 5 o'clock in the evening, I was coming from my work—as I turned the corner into the street, I saw the prisoner's wife shoved from inside their door into the street by main force, and the door slammed to—she then turned round and hammered at the door with the knocker, and she said, "My husband has kicked me"—I had nearly got up to my door by this time—I called to my wife, and stood with her at my door—the prisoner's wife continued knocking at their door for about two minutes—she then came across to me—there was a great</p>

               <p>he asked me if it was true his wife was dead—I said it was—he made no reply, I then again assured him it was the fact that she was dead—he said, "I have killed her, and I can meet nothing but death"—his wife had died about a quarter to 11 o'clock on that same night; when I saw her she was in a dying state, a doctor was there with her—I produce a pair of boots, which I took from the prisoner's feet—they are heavily nailed—he was wearing them that evening.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and reside at No. 1, Alpha-place, Old Kent-road. I was called in to see the dying woman—I first saw her between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening of the 19th—she was in a very excited state, as far as talking goes—she appeared in a sinking state—the lower part of her dress was saturated with blood—I took her up stairs, and laid her on the bed—I then examined, to see from what part the blood came—it came from the private parts—I could not tell at that time what was ruptured—she continued to sink, and died—after her death, I examined her person—I observed a bruised spot near where the blood came from—a kick or a blow might have produced that—on removing the skin, I found a rupture of the femoral artery—the hemorrhage from that rupture was the cause of death—the rupture corresponded with the external mark, and the bleeding was through the tissues of the upper part of the private parts—I observed other bruises about her person.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did you clearly trace the rupture to the bruise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think so; I have not the slightest doubt about it—the skin was not broken—it was just over the <hi rend="italic">pubic</hi> bone, just above the groin—the artery comes out over that bone—the rupture was immediately under the bruise, and within a quarter of an inch of it—the arteries of the lower extremities of all women who have borne many children are diseased, from</p>

               <p>the pressure upon them in labour—I understood she had had fourteen children—six are living—if the prisoner had fallen upon her with his knee, that would have accounted for the bruise—it is very difficult to say whether she was or not under the influence of liquor when I first saw her—she was either under the influence of liquor or very much excited—her tempera<lb/>ment was very excitable—hemorrhage is exceedingly depressing; it would not at all tend to excite a person—I have a doubt whether her excitement was from liquor; when I made the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi>, her stomach smelt very faintly of gin—I made that examination on the Tuesday, after her death on the Friday—all the tissues were locked up so that I think it might be ex<lb/>pected that the smell could not go off in the interval—it is true that spirit evaporates, but here it was locked up in the stomach—I should, of course, expect to find the smell more strong immediately after death—my impres<lb/>sion at the time was that she was under the influence of liquor, from her excited manner of speaking—she used a good deal of bad language—the hemorrhage would tend to diminish any drunkenness—if she had been drunk, it would to a certain extent sober her—in cases of hemorrhage, we generally find persons in a state of torpor or collapse, unless they are under the influence of liquor; they sink very rapidly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to my father, a timber merchant, at No. 1, Bear-lane, opposite Mr. Ede's yard. On Thursday, 11th Jan., I saw a waggon, loaded with timber, drive up to Mr. Ede's yard—my attention was particularly called to it; there were three very large trees at the back of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185501290103"/>
               <p>the waggon—it was not a timber carriage, it was a sugar waggon: what they use for carrying hogsheads of sugar, and it drew out and expanded, and the front part of the waggon had a beam across it, and two of the trees laid upon it—the back of the trees extended four or five feet above the sides of the waggon, so that they could not draw into the gateway, and Mr. Ede's men had to cut the limbs off—the timber was fastened on by a rope and a chain, which bound the three trees together—I did not notice whether one of the trees was lying on the other two—they took off one branch and drew it down into Mr. Ede's yard—they must have undone the rope and chain—I did not see them actually do it—I did not notice how many pieces were cut off—I lost sight of it for an hour and a half—I went about my business—I saw it again about 1 o'clock—I then saw the carman back<lb/>ing the two horses, pushing them back one in each hand—by the carman I mean the prisoner—he was backing them to get farther off, apparently to draw the waggon into the yard—I then went into my own place—I did not see the accident occur—I heard the waggon move, and then heard some<lb/>thing fall; it might be in about a minute or two afterwards—I went out and saw the tree on the ground, in fact two, and under it was a little girl, about thirteen or fourteen years old—after I got the girl out, I saw the de<lb/>ceased underneath, and the tree on her head, she was dead—the girl was hurt but very little—the waggon was then in motion, and I did not notice it then—I attended to the tree—I was about six yards from it when I came out of the gateway—I assisted in taking the woman to the workhouse—Bear-lane is a very great thoroughfare for foot passengers—I did not notice where the persons were standing before the accident occurred—when I saw the woman on the ground she was on the pavement, at least there is no pavement, or very little just where she fell, there are two or three very small flags—she was on the footway, and about fifty or sixty yards from the gateway down which the waggon was going.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engineer, living at 34, Gravel-lane. On Thursday, 11th Jan., I went to Mr. Ede's—I arrived there a little before 1 o'clock—the men were then cutting off the limbs of the trees—they were on what is called an expanding trolly—I think there were no chains round the trees at that time—after the limbs were no cut off the trees I spoke to the carman—I should not have recognised the prisoner again as the man—I said to "him, "Young man, which way are you coming in this gateway with this load; because if you are going to turn round, you have very bad ground to go over; and I would recommend you to look at the ground before you start"—he was then under the carriage, and I believe he said, "Oh, I think we shall be all right"—the ground lays considerably on the incline there, and the pavement is in a very bad condition—my fear was, there being very large holes in the pavement, that the trees not being chained, would jolt off—I believe the load was not secured—I went to the back of the carriage and took a second survey of it—I then spoke to the old sawyer who stood there—I do not think the prisoner could hear what I said to him, he was under the carriage—the old sawyer said he thought it would be safe to go over the ground—if the three trees had been bound together by means of a chain and a rope, I do not think they would have fallen off—they were three walnut trees, very crooked—if they had had a binding chain round the carriage, I think they would have been perfectly safe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Mr. Ede, of No. 37, Bear-lane. I remember a load of timber coming on 11th Jan.—I cannot say in whose care it was—the prisoner, I believe, drove it—I understood he came from the North Western Railway at Camden-town—there was a book carrier with the prisoner, but whether he was in charge with him I do not know—I should say he was about twenty years of age—I cannot say what his duty was—I never saw either of them before—the waggon was drawn by four horses—there were three walnut-trees on it—it was too wide to admit it into the gateway, and two limbs of the trees were obliged to be cut off to let it in—Bear-lane is a great thoroughfare for foot passengers—I saw the carriage turn to go back into the gateway—I was coming up the yard when he started from the gateway—I had been to put one of the limbs on the pile, and as I was returning he started from the gateway—I did not see him until after he had turned the horses; he was then at the head of the horses, and the carriage was in motion—I saw the underneath tree shift, and in a few seconds it fell, carrying a second one with it—I saw a child entangled underneath one of the trees by its clothes—it had a scratch on the face—whether it was hurt or not I cannot say—I saw a female under the same tree—I assisted in lifting the tree off her—she was totally dead by the time we got the tree off—I dare say the tree weighed from a ton to 30 cwts., as near as I could judge—I did not see how the timber was secured when it arrived—it had arrived there some time previous to my coming to the gate—they were not secured at the time they fell—I did not see any rope or chain belonging to the carriage with the timber—if the trees had been bound together by a chain and rope I should say it would have passed in with safety.</p>

               <p>recalled the prisoner—it is necessary to give notice of a set-off—there was no notice of set-off in this case, it went off on a different ground—the defence was, that he had discharged the then plaintiff at a moment's notice, on the ground of dishonesty, and that that exempted him from paying wages altogether—the point is this, the prisoner was a weekly servant, at 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. per week; for that stipend he was faithfully and honestly to serve his employer; he breaks faith in that contract, and having broken faith in that contract, he was not entitled to that sum for doing that which he had contracted to do—Mr. Smith, in effect, set that up as his defence, that he had never earned his wages, because before the time came he had discharged him, for a good reason.</p>

On 11th Dec., two young men came to my house with some velvet, to be made into a waistcoat—they ordered two waistcoats at first, and they were fetched away on the Saturday by the younger female prisoner, who told me that if I would call at No. 130,</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a milliner's shop in Edward-place, York-road. On 23rd Jan., the prisoner came in about 7 o'clock—I had two customers in the shop—the prisoner said, "serve me directly, I am in a hurry"—I left the calico shop and served him—he asked for a pair of socks, and said his feet were wet—they came to 8 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he gave me a half crown—I gave him 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver—I let the half crown lie on the counter, and directly he was gone 1 said, "This is a bad one"—finding it was bad, I went out to go to my brother-in-law, and as I crossed the road, I saw two men going to Mr. Cox's—I went to my brother-in-law—I had the half crown in my hand—I saw a constable passing my brother-in-law's window; I made a communication to him—I went with him to Mr. Cox's; I did not go into the shop, but I passed the window—I saw the prisoner and another man come out of the shop—the constable took the prisoner into custody—I do not know what became of the other man—I sell wool cuffs; I had them in my window that night—the prisoner was taken to my shop first, and then to the station—I followed him, and on the way Burdett gave me the pair of socks which I had sold to the prisoner—I gave the half crown I received from the prisoner to the constable.</p>

I live in York-road, Battersea—I deal in precisely the same articles as Miss Jones does—in the evening of 23rd Jan., the prisoner came to my shop with another man, who had a cigar in his mouth which was not lighted—the prisoner asked for a pair of woollen cuffs; they came to 3 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half crown, and I gave him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—the other man had four yards of black braid, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; he paid me in good money—they left the shop together—I saw the con<lb/>stable outside, and he took the prisoner—the other man went away as quick as ever he could—I bit the half crown, made a mark on it with my</p>

The prisoner was also a dock labourer—we did not work together—I was with him some days ago, I believe it was on Wednesday last, at St. Katharine's Dock—he asked me if I would take an order for him; I said I would—that was not the first time he spoke about it—he had asked me on Tuesday morning, and I told him "No"—he asked me again, and I said, what was it for?—he would not tell me what it was for, but he asked me to wait till 12 o'clock, and he would get the order—I told him, "No"—on Wednesday, before our wharfinger came out, the prisoner said to me, "If you don't get on, will you take that order for me? for I have brought the things with me to do it"—I said, "Come along"—we went over London-bridge, and he went into a stationer's shop—he told me to wait outside a moment, And I did wait—from there we went to a public house; I believe it was the Black Bull—when we got there, he called for a pint of beer, and asked the landlady if she would lend him some ink—he did not want a pen, he had got one—they gave him some ink—he had some paper, and he wrote three or four orders—he tore this order off, gave it to me, and told me to take it to Moser and Sons, and if they should ask me any questions, to tell them that Mr. Dale's son, who had just come out of the Blue-coat School, wrote it—he said it would be a very good thing, it would be about 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, and there was no fear of their finding us out, for they always gave Mr. Dale six months' credit, and we could go there and get some more things afterwards—I consented to take it, and after I had done so, I made a communication at the Southwark station—I then went to Mr. Moser's, and his shopman sent me into the counting house—I saw Mr. Moser, and gave the order to him—he gave it to the shopman, who gave me the goods and the invoice—I told the shopman about my having been to the police, and he gave me the goods under these circumstances—the prisoner had told me, when I got the goods to come back to the Black Bull, and tap at the window, and he would come and receive them of me—when I came out with the goods, the prisoner was standing in the street,</p>

               <p>looking in a coffee shop window—I gave him the invoice, and asked him to take the goods—he would not take them; he said he had to go across the road, to speak to Mr. Sharp—the policeman came up, and took him into custody—before we got to the Black Bull, the prisoner took off his apron, and said to me, "Take my apron, and put it on you."</p>

After the wedding festivities were over, we were returning by a boat from Limehouse Hole Stairs—I could not exactly tell the time, but it must have been after the time of shutting up—Daniel Hurley, the father and mother, and the sister of the young woman who was married, accompanied us to the stairs—when I got on the stairs, I met the prisoner—he said, "Halloo, Timmins"—I said, "I don't know you, you have got the advantage of me"—he said, "Oh, I know you"—I said, "Are you going over the water?"—he said, "Yes"—I went into the boat and said, "Hand my mistress in, if you please"—he helped my mistress into the boat, but she and he got into the water first—we were then ferried over the water—we got out of the boat, on the Surrey side—the prisoner got out first, my wife next—I stopped, and paid the waterman the fare for all—we went down the alley, and turned down the street, making our way home—the prisoner laid hold of my wife's arm sometimes and sometimes he let it alone; my wife walked behind us two—as we got about ten yards from my house I said, "Well, my man, which way are you going? I am at home"—I was just going to say, "Good night," and at that moment my foot was kicked from under me, and he laid hold of my guard—he kicked my leg; I was obliged to go to the hospital—he snatched my watch out of my pocket; I saw it in his hand afterwards—he ran away; my guard was a silver one—it had been broken before, and was sewn together with black thread—I cannot tell where it broke, whether on the thread or where it was broken away from my neck and nothing left—when he kicked me I was <hi rend="italic">obligated</hi> to fall; I had no power to help myself; my wife ran after the prisoner—I got up again as quickly as I could, and got to the top of the alley—he went round the Seven Houses, I saw him pass the top of those houses; I gave the alarm, "Stop thief!" as loud as ever I could, and ran after him as well as I could—my watch was silver, it cost me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I had been drinking some little at the wedding—I have no recollection of seeing the prisoner before that night—I have no doubt he was the man who accosted me, and did this to me—I saw him again, when the policeman brought him to my house the same night—I should think about half past 1 o'clock—he was dressed exactly in the same way as he was when I saw him first.</p>

I said, "You have got the advantage of me"—he said, he had known me at the Commercial Docks twelve months ago, and he had worked for me (I was foreman of the Commercial Docks twelve months ago)—I said to him, "Are you going over the water?" and we all went over—I understand the waterman is here who took us over—he was examined before the Magistrate; he did not go before the Grand Jury—I should think my house is half a mile from the river—we met very few per<lb/>sons; one old man, I think—when I called, "Stop thief!"

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Cow-lane, Rotherhithe. I was in Queen-street about half past 10 o'clock on Sunday night, 14th Jan.—I heard some one halloo out, "Stop thief, he has got my watch!"—I saw some man coming towards me—I asked him if he had got anything belonging to that man—I allowed him to pass; he went by me two or three yards, and began to run—I ran after him—I did not see his face at all; I can only say I saw his back—he was not much taller than myself, if any—I saw the prisoner at Greenwich on the Monday—I can only say that the person I saw had a coat on—I noticed his coat and his cap—he was dressed in the same coat as the prisoner was when I saw him—when I ran after the man, I saw him try to run into a doorway, and he could not—I followed him till he got to the palings—I saw him, as he ran up Queen-street, <hi rend="italic">chuck</hi> something over the palings—I followed him from the bottom of Queen-street to the top of Queen-street—he then went over some palings into the back gardens—he went over into a rope ground—I saw some one running after him—I did not stop to see him: I ran after the prisoner—I do not know whether it was the man who was hallooing out—I heard the hallooing at the bottom of Queen-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the White House, in Lower Queen-street. On Sunday night, 14th Jan., while at my supper, I heard a cry of "Stop thief 1" about half past 10 o'clock—that is about a quarter of a mile from where the prosecutor lives—I immediately went to the door, and saw two men running, the policeman and another—I could not identify the other man, he had his cap over his eyes—he turned down Silver-street, and I turned down too—at the time I got to the corner I caught a glimpse of him turning into Button's-place, which is no thoroughfare—he turned into the gardens, and it caused a disturbance; lights were brought, and I saw a man get over in the rope ground—I got over the rope ground, and saw him get on the tiles of the rope ground, and he went over the other side—there is a ditch and a little space of ground—I saw him slip down the tiles—I thought there was a space, but there was not—I lost sight of him for a few moments—I saw him again go over the Commercial Dock fence—I was near to him—I could touch the toe of his boot as he came down the tiles—I could not see his face, he had his cap so over it; but I saw him get over the dock fence into Commercial Dock—I got in likewise—I observed tar</p>

               <p>on the fence, and I got in a mess by getting over—I took notice of his dress, and said to him, "I shall know you again; I can see you have either got a red waistcoat or else a red collar"—when I saw him before the Magistrate I knew him again—I observed that he had the same waistcoat on, and his hands were all tar—I saw the prisoner on the Monday, the day after.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, M</hi> 276). On Sunday night, 14th Jan., I was in Lower Queen-street, Rotherhithe—about a quarter to 11 o'clock I heard a cry of "Stop thief!" and saw a number of persons running—I saw the last witness at the back of Silver-street, looking where the prisoner went over—in consequence of what he said, I saw a man on the top of the rope shed tiles—1 got into the rope walk—the man got over the tiles—I expected 'he would come down the rope walk, but he got down on to the fence leading to the Commercial Dock—I heard the last witness cry—I came to him, and he said he had just got over the dock—I got over the palings, they were rather tarry, and the witness and I looked over, and could not see anything of him—I then placed myself at the top of Silver-street, and remained there till near 1 o'clock—there are two entrances coming out of the dock, and I placed myself in a position to command both entrances—I could not be seen—about ten minutes past 1 o'clock I saw the prisoner coming out of Mr. Bridges' wharf, looking up and down the road very curiously—when I saw him he pretended to sham drunk, and put his hands in his pockets—I said, "Where have you been?"—he said he had had a <hi rend="italic">spree</hi> at Deptford, and had been drinking with some companions—I said, "Who were they?"—he said "Nobody," he did not know <hi rend="italic">nobody</hi> there—I said, "You are charged with a highway robbery; you must come with me to Mr. Timmins; if he can recognize you you must go to the station"—he said, "I did not take <hi rend="italic">no</hi> watch"—I had said he was charged with taking a watch—when I got him to Mr. Timmins' house he appeared as sober as I was—when I got there I knocked at the door, and Mrs. Timmins came down with her face saturated with blood—I said, "Do you know this man?"—she said, "Yes, that is the man that assaulted me and robbed my husband"—I took him to the station house, and examined him—his trowsers were quite wet to his knees, and the front of his shirt also, and his hands were all over tar, the same as mine were—I had got the tar on my hands from getting over the Commercial Dock palings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know how a person could get from where you lost the prisoner into the wharf? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There are two entrances—it is divided in two places by separate gates—he could come back the same way he went, and he could get back over the palings into Silver-street—the place where I lost him does not communicate with anything near the water—I lost him as he was going in the Commercial Dock—on the opposite side to which he got in, the dock is inclosed with palings on this side—I got over them, and so did Pidgeon—on the opposite side I cannot say what incloses it—it is all timber piles, and a stream of water on the other side.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long would it take to go from there to Limehouse, including the chance of getting a boat immediately? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say five minutes to cross the water, and about five minutes to get to the water—that would depend on the state of the tide, and whether you could get a boat directly—if you went as quickly as you could to the river side, and jumped into a boat immediately, it would take about ten minutes; but if the tide were against you, and you could not get a boat immediately, it would take a longer time.</p>
