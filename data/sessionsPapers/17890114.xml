They continued for some years living together; but for the last two or three years of her life he resided in London and she at Enfield. On the 27th of October last he went down to Enfield, and persuaded her to come to London; telling her he had taken a lodging in Holborn for her, which would be more convenient for him, as he said he was a servant in London. She proceeded from Enfield to London with him, at two o'clock, on Tuesday the 27th of October. On Wednesday the 28th of October, a gardener's servant, who lived at Chelsea, was preparing to go to market: in a narrow lane, called Robinson's Lane, he found a woman laying partly in the ditch, very much beaten indeed, and apparently dead. He immediately applied to the watchman, and told him the situation of the woman; that watchman applied to a second; and they came there, and found the woman in that situation. Supposing she was dead, they covered her with her apron, took care of her, and went to the parish-officer: he, early in the morning, directed this poor creature should be carried to the workhouse, and put into a warm bed; and that a surgeon and apothecary should be instantly sent for. They went immediately; she was put into a warm bed. She remained insensible till towards the evening; then recovered her senses; told who she was, and where she came from. On the next morning a magistrate attended, and she there gave a description of herself; saying her name was

Having the description of her person, and the person she was with, application was made at Enfield; and there it turned out, that a neighbour of her's, a Mrs. Brace, had seen this woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140004"/>on the Monday, about two o'clock, set off in company with her husband; having in her hand a small bundle, and a good black satin cloak on. On the Thursday afterwards, the prisoner returned to Enfield, and went to the house of the deceased; and the woman having asked him where his wife was, he said that she was gone to Hampton Court, that being a place where a master of her's lived who brought her to England. The woman said she did not believe it; but he said it was so. He left Enfield. It was then unknown where the prisoner lived: he had said he was a servant, and a servant in London; but no trace, no knowledge, could be acquired of the prisoner. Upon which the parish-officers, much to their honour, advertised the man, and offered a reward of 20 l. the consequence of which was, that about a fortnight after, a coachman met the prisoner, knew his person, and apprehended him. They went to his lodgings in Westminster, and there they found he had married another woman, the 2d of November; and it will turn out to you in evidence, that this man had been asked in church, on Sunday the 19th of October, and on Sunday the 26th of October, (which was the day before the murder was committed) as a single man. The murder was committed on Monday the 27th, and the Sunday following he was out-asked in church; and the Thursday after that, he was married to his present wife. On examining the lodgings further, they found a bundle; which bundle was in a coloured handkerchief, which was described by the woman at Enfield to have been purchased that day, and it contained caps and other things: and they also found a stick, a bludgeon, on one side the room, which apparently was bloody: and they also found a satin cloak, which appeared to be stiff with something, but with what they could not tell, as it was a black cloak; but being damped, and wrapped up with white things, it turned out that that stiffness was blood; for it had blooded the white things. Upon these circumstances the prisoner is brought here for trial. I forgot to mention to you, that at the spot was found not only a part of her ear, but a part of the stick, which was bloody. Upon these circumstances, Gentlemen, you are to judge of the guilt or innocence of the prisoner. Happy it is for the publick, that these circumstances have come out which brings this man before you to be tried for this offence. The circumstances appear to me to be very strong: the woman, at a time when she had a recollection, though severely beat, was enabled to describe who she was, who she had been with, and how she had been beat. In that story, though it was on her oath, she will be confirmed by Mrs. Brace, her neighbour; and also she will tell you, the false account which he gave, that he had sent his wife to Hampton Court. If all these facts convince your minds that the prisoner is the man that committed this murder, it becomes your duty, though a painful one, to pronounce him guilty.</p>

               <p>Court.

I saw she had had a violent blow, or a cut, on the side of her<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140005"/>head. She had a kind of lightish gown on, to the best of my knowledge; I did not take much observation in my fright; and a cloth apron and handkerchief, but no cap or cloak when I found her.</p>
               <p>How did her cloaths, her dress lay; was she covered? - She was covered as far as this, every thing of her cloaths lay straight upon her.</p>
               <p>Did her cloaths lay in the manner in which, if she had met with any accident, and had fallen, they were likely to lay; or did they appear to have been smoothed? - No, I cannot say they appeared any thing like that; the cloaths lay all straight, as if she had laid herself down, and pulled her cloaths straight, by what I could see of her.</p>
               <p>Was the ditch hollow, was there any depth? - A little hollow.</p>
               <p>Did the body rest in the bottom of the ditch? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. At the end of Church Lane, Chelsea, I was called by Cannon to a woman who was found in Robinson's Lane. She was laying flat upon her back; no cap at all; her hair tied at top of her head, either with a red ribbon or a garter; her apron was down, and her feet under a hedge; and I saw her wounds very plain on each side of her head: the head was the side of the road, and the feet under the hedge. There was room enough for a person to walk by. She was cut in a most shocking manner; her temples were both cut open, but her left was rather more; and whether her eye was out I cannot justly say, but her left eye was sadly swelled. She had a white apron on; I took it and flung it over her face, and tucked it under her head.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the apron clean? - It had been a clean apron, but I really believe there was blood upon it, I cannot justly say; it appeared to be very rumpled. I went down to

               <p>Could she walk? - She walked, I suppose, the value of twelve or fourteen yards, and then she said she could not walk any further, she was so weak and so faint: she asked several times, how much further we were going to take her. The clock struck four: I left Glover and went to my watch again. I never saw her after, till I saw her a corpse. I left her in the care of Glover.</p>
               <p>She had discovered signs of life before you went to call Glover? - Yes, and spoke to me.</p>
               <p>What was the first thing you asked her? - The first thing I asked her was, whether her name was Sophia, because there was a person very like her description who lived near there; she was a Mulatto woman; and she said Silvia, twice very plain: that was all I could get out of her. I asked her several times, who it was used her so ill; she made no answer.</p>

Cannon left us: I took my lanthorn, and went up to Pennyfeather, and saw the body lay; I said, it is a pity she should lay here; let us take her somewhere, to get some relief for her. I went to the bottom of the lane, and called the beadle. He came in about five minutes; then he went to the overseer, and came back again. He said he must take her up to the work-house. Going along, I found<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140006"/>one of her shoes missing: and in the place where she lay, I found the shoe.</p>
               <p>Did any thing pass? - I could not understand a word, she had such a rattling in her throat.</p>
               <p>Where did you find that shoe you spoke of? - One side the ditch. On the right-hand side going up.</p>
               <p>Did you find it in the road, or by the bank, or in the ditch? - In the ditch, where I took her body from.</p>
               <p>Can you tell whether her shoes were on at the time you took her up to lead her away, or whether that shoe was off? - I could not tell that.</p>
               <p>Then in helping her up, perhaps, you might have drawn off the shoe? - Yes. The next day, the surgeon and apothecary said the body had lost one of her ears; and in the thick of the blood, I raked with my finger, and found her ear; there was a deal of blood there. When it was light in the morning, I went to the spot where she was laying, and there was a deal of blood.</p>
               <p>How was she when you first found her? - All over blood; we could not tell what colour she was, only by her hands.</p>
               <p>Whereabout did you find the blood? - In the ditch where I took her body from.</p>
               <p>Was it a quantity of blood, or drops of blood dispersed? - I believe there might be near a quart of blood, because it was sunk down into the ground. It was quite matted hard; I parted it, and took her ear up. It appeared to be a whole ear that I took out of the blood; I gave it to the surgeon.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing else? - There was a seal lay where her body was in the ditch.</p>
               <p>Any thing else? - There was a stick picked up. This is the stick.</p>
               <p>(A piece of a common stick shattered at the end)</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You was there before she was raised from the ground? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were her feet close together, or in any other position? - Her feet were nearly together.</p>
               <p>You never saw her before? - No.</p>
               <p>You do not know who she was? - No.</p>
               <p>What age did she appear to be of? - I could not tell, she was all in such a situation.</p>

               <p>I am overseer of the parish of Chelsea. I was called up about five in the morning of the 27th of October, by the beadle, who informed me the watchman had found a woman very much beat and bloody; and that he did not know whether she would live, or was living. I told him to take her to the work-house, and order the master of the work-house to send immediately for a surgeon and apothecary; and as soon as it was light, I went up myself. The surgeon and apothecary were there. They examined the woman, and found that one of her ears was cut off or beat off, and that she was very bloody; and they were of opinion, that she must have been beat some time before, from the congealed blood.</p>

               <p>It was a Mulatto woman? - Yes. We agreed to meet at four o'clock, and find then, whether she was able to give any account where she came from; accordingly we met. She informed us, that her name was

            , of Enfield Highway; and that she, with her husband, came from Enfield Highway, about two o'clock, on Monday, the 27th; and that they stopped at the Basing-house, and drank one pint of beer between them; (that is in Kingsland Road, I believe) and he told her she was to go to a lodging in Holborn; and she walked with him a long way, till it came dark, till they went to a bye place, where there were a few houses; and after passing them, they came to a narrow lane; he then asked her for the keys of her lodging and box; she then told him, William, it is time enough to give you the keys when you come to your new lodging, with that he hit her with a stick, and knocked her down, and she knew no more till she was in Chelsea work-house. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140007"/>we left the work-house, I went and examined the place in company with the surgeon and apothecary; and the stick which was produced, and the ear, and the seal which were found; that stick was wet with blood at the time it was picked up. The watchman met us, and there was a great deal of blood. There is another stick which was brought to me the next morning, and found about ten yards from the place: it was brought to me by a man; but not being found at the time, I thought it was not material. That man is not here. This is a part of the seal which was found among the blood. It was only this part of the seal which was found.</p>
               <p>(Handed up to the Court.)</p>
               <p>It was a seal that turned upon pivots, I see? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. What time did she mention she came from Enfield? - Near about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Did she say how long it was from the time they left Enfield, to the time of the difference taking place? - She said it was dark. I imagine it was near seven o'clock. She repeated the words twice over.</p>
               <p>How far is Enfield from Robinson's Lane? - I should think it fifteen miles. I am not acquainted with the ground.</p>
               <p>Court. How could they get to Robinson's Lane, without coming through London? - They must go through the New-road, Islington; that is the only way I know, and then they must go through Hyde Park. I believe the prisoner knows that part of the town very well; as I have heard from Mr. Hall, that he lived groom at Hyde Park Corner.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a surgeon at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Describe to my Lord and the Jury, the whole that you know of this transaction? - On Tuesday morning, about six, I was called up to a poor woman who had been brought into the work house, they said, almost dead: she was a Mulatto woman. I went there and saw her. I met Mr. Powell, the apothecary, and we went and found her in bed. She was in so bad a state at that time, I did not imagine she would live many hours; she was almost senseless at that time. She appeared to have received several wounds on the head, and to have lost a great quantity of blood; her hair was so matted by the blood, that I could not make any examination immediately of the exact state of the wounds. I desired her head might be fomented with some warm water and cloths; I recommended to have some wine given to her, and I should return in the course of a few hours, when I thought I should form a proper examination: it was very evident at that time she had lost her ear. I returned in four or five hours; I found her then considerably better. I examined her head then, and there were in all eight wounds; there were one on each orbit of the eye, the bones of which were laid bare, and evidently fractured and broke, the orbit that was on the right side; on the left side there appeared to be a wound, but I could not at that time find any fracture; there were several other wounds on different parts of the head, but none of them so material as that. I attended her with Mr. Powell the apothecary, two or three times a day; we were generally together. She died, I think, on the Friday night. I saw her on Friday, the last day. On the Sunday, in company with Mr. Powell, I examined her head.</p>
               <p>Do you mean that you opened the head? - No, we did not open the head, for we found no fracture of the skull. These were the bones that were taken out of the left side, and those were taken out of the right side; for on examination after this, we found both sides of the face were broke, and the bones shattered in a dreadful manner; that is, the bone which forms the greater part of the orbit: that part of the orbit was detached from its connections entirely on both sides, both from the jaw below, and the skull above.</p>
               <p>(The bones that were taken out handed to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>On our return, the ear was picked up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140008"/>by 
Glover, the watchman. It was delivered into my care.</p>


               <p>Could you judge from the appearance of the separation, in what manner it was most likely to be effected; whether it was cut off, or torn off, or wrenched off, or beat off by some sudden blow? - I found myself very much puzzled to form any judgment; but on the whole, I think it was struck off from behind with a stick. It was taken off very close.</p>
               <p>Not cut, you think? - I think not.</p>
               <p>All that you can say is, that it was more probable it was taken off by a blow from behind? - I should rather suppose so.</p>
               <p>(The ear produced to the Jury.)</p>
               <p>I suppose it is hardly practicable to have twisted it off? - I should rather suppose not. I really could not form a proper judgment; I endeavoured, and considered the matter as much as I possibly could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Then you do not affect to know with what weapon it was done? - No, Sir, it is impossible.</p>
               <p>If you had seen this subject, independent of the sticks and things you saw, would you have then thought it was done with a stick? - I think I should: if I had been obliged to give one opinion, I should certainly have said I thought it was done with a stick behind, independent of seeing the sticks.</p>
               <p>Court. In your judgment, were the wounds the cause of the death? - There can be no doubt but the woman died in consequence of the wounds.</p>
               <p>What way did the wounds operate to produce death: was there any appearance of mortification, or was the brain affected at all? - The brain was not affected at all.</p>
               <p>Was there any fever? - Only a kind of fever that is occasioned by loss of blood.</p>
               <p>Was there any mortification? - A mortification took place all over the face before she died, particularly on the right side. I could form very little judgment of the soft parts, they were in such a state of mortification.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. She appeared to be considerably mangled? - Very much.</p>
               <p>It is possible that a subject might have that appearance of being so wounded by a round smooth iron? - Undoubtedly.</p>
               <p>And there might be much difficulty to distinguish by which the wound was given? - It is not possible to tell whether the blows were given by a stick or by a poker.</p>
               <p>Court. You attended this woman from Tuesday morning to Friday evening? - Yes.</p>
               <p>During what part of that time was she able to speak? - From the time I returned the second time to the work-house, she was perfectly sensible, even to the last time I saw her. She spoke and gave a very rational account, and very particular as to the several circumstances that have been mentioned. I was the first person that did hear the account.</p>
               <p>What was the account she gave? - I will recall it as well as I can to memory. I took it down on paper, then I gave it to one of the officers. The first was, that her name was 
               <persName id="t17890114-1-person60">

            , that she set out from Enfield in company with her husband, at two o'clock; that they walked together for some hours; when it grew dark about seven o'clock, that they then came to a narrow bye lane, and he asked her for some keys; her reply was, William, it will be time enough to give you them when I see the lodging; and upon that, some altercation took place, and he struck her down.</p>
               <p>Did she use the expression altercation, or is it your idea? - It is my idea; she said, upon her refusal again, she received this blow, which deprived her of her senses.</p>
               <p>You mean no more by altercation than that there was a talk about the keys? - That was all.</p>
               <p>Did you hear this twice, or only once? - I heard it once, which was the first time and every time. I endeavoured to get all I could out of her; and she was very particular in mentioning the keys, and receiving<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140009"/>the blow; this she spoke as very particularly.</p>
               <p>I How often do you think you spoke to her on the subject? - Every time I dressed her, which was twice a-day, from Tuesday to Friday.</p>
               <p>Then the subject was mentioned four or five times, or more? - Oh, repeatedly. I endeavoured every time, as much as the state of her health would permit.</p>
               <p>Were the accounts she gave uniform? - Very much so, indeed.</p>
               <p>Consistant? - I do not know that she prevaricated once. I do not recollect a single mistake.</p>
               <p>When you asked her questions as to the states of her health, were her answers clear and sensible? - Perfectly so.</p>
               <p>It appeared only so then, that these accounts were given with a perfect possession of herself? - Quite so indeed.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she conceived herself to be in any danger? - I do not know that. The day before she died; she seemed to think so; for on a question being asked her, she said it was no matter.</p>
               <p>Was this subject mentioned to her on that day at all? - On the day before she died?</p>
               <p>Yes? - No, I do not recollect it was mentioned that day.</p>
               <p>Did she express any desire that the person that had done her this injury should be punished? - I never heard her.</p>
               <p>Did she describe the injury with coolness, or with marks of resentment against the person who had used her so? - No. I think with great coolness.</p>
               <p>She expressed no desire of revenge, or any thing of that kind? - Not in my hearing. I never heard her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. You knew nothing of her, but what she said of herself? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Court. What aged woman did she appear to be? - She was so very much hurt and mangled, that I could form no judgment. I thought she might be between thirty and forty; but I found she was considerably more than that.</p>
               <p>What sized woman? - A very small woman: very short.</p>
               <p>Was there any circumstance about her person, as far as your observation went; that could lead to her being very well known? - I should suppose from her figure and her colour; that there could never be any mistake made about her person.</p>
               <p>Was there any ring on her finger? - There was a ring found before I saw her, by the people of the work-house.</p>
               <p>Were her cloaths preserved? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are they to court? - Mr. Gibbs. Not the things she had on when she was taken to the work-house.</p>
               <p>They should have been here. Is there any thing here that was about her person at the time? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Court to the watchman. Describe the gown more particularly? - It was like second mourning. Like a raven grey, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an apothecary to Chelsea workhouse. I was sent for early on the 28th of October. Between five and six I went up to the work-house, as soon as I was called. When I came there, this Mulatto woman was just put to bed. She just swallowed a little warm wine and water. I then looked over her head; it was all blood, and a number of wounds in different parts of her head and face. I looked on the right side of her head, there was no ear: the blood was matted considerably in the hair of her head, and remained very hard; the face was considerably swelled, the blood oozing from the eyes, and from the nostrils. I begged them to put warm things to her feet, and to give her a little more wine, if she could swallow it: then I was informed Mr. Read, the surgeon, was sent for, and I retired immediately, till he came. Mr. Read and Mr. Gibbs soon came, then we three went to her again; and the head was so covered with blood, it appeared so matted, that Mr. Read and me agreed, with the use of warm milk and water, and cloaths, to have it opened a little; we also<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140010"/>agreed on what medicine was best for her. I saw her again in that day, and I saw her twice a day during her life. I assisted Mr. Read mostly in the dressing.</p>
               <p>Was she collected and sensible in the afternoon of that day? - She gave an account of her name, and where she was married; she said that she had been married about nine years, at Cheshunt. She said her name was Woodcock; that her husband was a gentleman's servant, and hired somewhere in London; but London was a large place. Afterwards Mr. Read, Mr. Gibbs, and me, went; as we went home, we met Glover, the watchman, and went with him to the place where he found the body; and when we came to that place, the weeds of the ditch seemed to have been pressed down, and on the side of the bank there was blood; and there was blood interspersed among the weeds, in different places. We there found a piece of a stick, and part of a swing seal. Upon recollection of the dryness of the blood upon the woman's head, we could not tell whether she was ill treated there; or had been brought there. We searched for the ear, and found the ear among the weeds, in that ditch; that ear, in my opinion, must belong to the same body.</p>
               <p>Court. Then you was satisfied, when you found the ear, that she had been ill-treated there? - Perfectly satisfied. After this I assisted Mr. Read in examining the wounds of the head. The orbit of her right-eye was fractured; the cheek-bone beat in, and fractured; the head was very putrid; I believe there were five fragments of bones taken from the right-side; on the left-side there was a fracture also, and two or three fragments were taken from there, which were quite loose: the putrefaction was very great.</p>
               <p>What was the cause of her death? - I should suppose the wounds, and contusions, and bruises, must be the cause of her death; and loss of blood, most likely, contributed also. I heard her give an account of herself at different times.</p>
               <p>How many times? - She gave a very good account of herself Tuesday evening; and Wednesday she gave an account of herself; tolerably on Thursday; on Friday I had not an opportunity of asking her many questions.</p>
               <p>Did the accounts agree? - They always agreed; the woman seemed to speak the pure truth. I asked her how she got her livelihood; she said, working in the gardens, or any thing. On Thursday evening the putrefaction was getting on so fast at that time, Mr. Read and I had agreed that Mr. North, another surgeon, should be called in. Mr. Read said he did not know whether she would recover or not; the putrefaction was coming on very fast. She gave a good account of herself still; at this time her memory was good. On Friday I do not know of asking her many questions.</p>
               <p>Did she seem to have much attention herself to her own condition? - Very little. She wished she could die, because she had no eye-sight, I believe; for when that seal was shewn her, to ask her if it was her husband's seal, she said she could not see, and it sometimes made her blunder. I question whether she could see at all, the swelling was so very great, and the injury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Would you have taken upon you to say, with any degree of certainty, if the circumstances which have been described had not been told to you, could you have given any opinion as to the instrument? - From the lacerated state of the wounds, I should presume to say it was not done with a cutting instrument.</p>
               <p>Would you have said, to any degree of certainty, whether it was done by an instrument of iron or wood? - I could not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>What size woman was she? - A small size; delicately made. I have seen many She was rather diminutive: she had no deformity, that I saw: she seemed to be a neat little woman: she was rather pale; than they usually are, but that might be from loss of blood.</p>
               <p>I think you say that she said, in general<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140011"/>terms, that her husband was a servant in London? - That he lived in London, and London was a large place.</p>

               <p>Did you put it into your own language, or did you copy it from her own words? -</p>
               <p>I asked her the questions, and the answers I put down into writing. I told her it would be necessary for her to speak the truth. I told her I was a magistrate, and I was come to take her examination, and she was to swear to it, and sign it. I asked her if she knew the nature of an oath; (I found she was a Mulatto woman, a native of the East Indies) she said she knew the nature of an oath: I told her she was calling God to witness the truth of what she was to relate; she said she would.

               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you administer the oath to her? - I did. I read it over to her afterwards, and gave it to her to sign; she said she could not see, but she said she would make a mark on the paper, which she did.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell her your reason for coming to her? - I did. I told her it was necessary for her to tell the truth, that we might find out the person that had used her in that manner.</p>

               <p>I live at Enfield Highway. I knew the prisoner very well.</p>
               <p>Did you know any other part of the family? - Only his wife.</p>
               <p>Where did she live? - At Enfield Highway, the next house to me.</p>
               <p>Did he live with her? - Not lately, Sir; he had been at a gentleman's place for about two years, and as much as since last August.</p>
               <p>He did not live with her? - No; he came backwards and forwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140012"/>When did you see him last? - I saw him the 30th of October last.</p>
               <p>When had you seen him before that? - I saw him the seven-and-twentieth.</p>
               <p>About what time? - About two o'clock on Monday, the 27th of October.</p>
               <p>Did you see her then? - Yes, she went from my house.</p>
               <p>Tell us if you heard from him, or from her, in his presence, where they were going? - Yes; she came to me the 27th of October, and told me she was going to Holborn: he came afterwards to the door; I says, Mr. Woodcock, you are come, says I; I do not like this parting at all; says he, do not you like it, then you may keep her; keep her, says he again, if you do not like it: says I, Mr. Woodcock, what should I keep your wife for. She started up to go; it was about two o'clock; and he said, what need you be in such a hurry, you are in a devilish hurry, you will be time enough; so she staid a little longer, and then she got up, and took her leave of me, and set off for town.</p>
               <p>How long had she been to you, to take leave of you, before he came? - About a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Was he present when she said she was going to Holborn? - I went to their own house about one, and I said, Mr. Woodcock, are you going? and he said, yes; they were then both together going to dinner.</p>
               <p>What did you say? - Says I, what, do you think of going? and they said, yes. Says I, where are you going, Mr. Woodcock? and he said he was going to Holborn. I said, and what is your wife to do there? he said she was to clean a room that was as dirty as the devil, by taking the grates down. Says I, is not your wife to come back? he said he did not know for that; but if she did not, he should come back again. I said, what is your wife to do in an empty room? he said she might lay at his lodging. Says I, do not you lodge at that place? no, says he; but he said he lodged just by. She says, Will, says she, I must come back again to pack up my pea-sticks: she had a large garden, and she had made a reserve of the pea-sticks. Then I took leave of them, and came away from them. I said, I will not bid you good-b'ye, I shall see you again; because they were to leave the key of the house with me, and pass my house to town. She came about two o'clock to me, and he followed her about a quarter of an hour after she had been at my house: they set off a little after two o'clock. When they came, that passed which I have related before, and he went in about half an hour afterwards. He went back to the house, and came back again. I asked him what room he had taken, he said a room in Holborn; and I asked him what he might give a year for the room, and he said, what did I think; I said 5 l. and he said 5 l. 10 s. but he said that was cheaper than giving 10 l. a year. 10 l. says I, you pay but 4 l. what do you give for your lodging in town? he said, what do you think? I said 18 d. he said, yes, but there is nobody to get a bit of hot victuals, and he paid 4 l. for the place he rented there. Then I asked him, when do you think of returning again? when he brought the keys to me, which might be near half after two, for what I know; and he said he should be back on Tuesday or Wednesday, at the furthest; this was Monday: then he went away. He came down again the 30th of October, which was the Thursday, about nine in the morning; he came by one of the morning coaches. He came in for the keys; the officers had been at my house on the Wednesday; and when he came, says I, Woodcock, here has been some of Mr. Wilmot's runners after you. Runners! says he, what should they want with me? Says I, I do not know what they want with you, Woodcock, but they want you; they were here, for one of them was in my house half an hour. I told him the officers had asked me a many questions, and I answered them indifferent, and I am sure they want you; and I told them I expected him home on the Wednesday: he said it must be a mistake, they could not want him. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140013"/>he was going into his house with the keys, I said to him, says I, Woodcock, where is your wife? says he, she is gone to Hampton Court. I said, when did she go? he said, on Tuesday morning, the 28th of October. Says I, she is not gone to Hampton Court; for, says I, you know she took nothing with her fit to go to Hampton Court. He said, he knew she did not take much. He took the keys, and went to his house; he returned back again with the keys to me in about rather better than a quarter of an hour, I believe. When he came back with the keys, I looked very stern at him: says I, Woodcock, do not lie, to say your wife is gone to Hampton Court, for she is not; he said, in a very surly, chuff manner to me, but I say she is. I said to him, pray, then, when do you return again here, if she is gone to Hampton Court; he said, when she came back from Hampton Court. I said to him, and where, pray, did you overtake your wife? he said, at the Basing-house. I said, had she got so far as that before you overtook her? and he said, yes. And when he went, instead of taking the road to go to London, he took the downward road, and went across the fields, the back way to town; he went as if he was going down the country, instead of going to town, and went the back way.</p>
               <p>Did he say he was going the back way? - No; he went down the great road, as if he was going into the country; I saw him about a stones's throw from my house. I know no further.</p>
               <p>Court. Had the people that came from the Justices told you their business? - No; they kept me in the dark; quite so.</p>
               <p>Did he leave the key with you again? - Yes.</p>
               <p>For what time have you known the woman? - I have known her, I believe near seven years; between six and seven years.</p>
               <p>She was a black woman? - A Mulatto.</p>
               <p>Do you know of what country? - I cannot rightly say the part she came from.</p>
               <p>Where did he marry her from? - From one Mr. Lane's; who lived at Cheshunt at first, but moved after to some part of the town.</p>
               <p>What sized woman was she? - She was a very small woman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Did you see her after this? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you see her body afterwards? - Oh, yes, I saw her at Chelsea.</p>
               <p>What you was sent for? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What day was it you went to Chelsea? - It was on Tuesday; I was there in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>And you saw the body at Chelsea? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that that corpse that you saw was the body of

            ? - Yes, I am positive of it.</p>
               <p>When she left Enfield, what did she take with her? - She had a handkerchief, with a trifle of things in it.</p>
               <p>What kind of handkerchief? - It was a blue and white checkered handkered, which she bought in my house of a man that day: what was in it I cannot tell; there were a small quantity of things.</p>
               <p>How was she dressed? - In a very good black bonnet, with a white lining; and a very good black satin cloak.</p>
               <p>What was the colour of her gown? - A half-mourning gown, and a green petticoat.</p>
               <p>Did you see any cloaths when you was at Chelsea? - I saw her gown and her petticoat; and I am positive the corpse was the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. How far is your residence from the Basing House, in Shoreditch? - About ten miles.</p>
               <p>Did you examine the gown and petticoat that you saw at Chelsea? - No, I cannot say I did.</p>
               <p>Then, if I understand you right, it was a gown and petticoat of the same colour that she used to wear? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The body you saw was very much mangled, was not it? - No.</p>
               <p>Was not it in a state of putrefaction? - Why, it smelt very much; but her face was the same as if she had been living.</p>
               <p>Was not her face very much disfigured?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140014"/>- I saw no disfigurement; I knew her as perfect as if she had been alive.</p>
               <p>Which was the most perfect part of her face, the lower part or the upper part? - I do not know. Her nose rather seemed flatter.</p>
               <p>Did you ever observe, in her life-time, what kind of ears she had? - Never. Her face was not disfigured; I knew her as well as if she had been living. I always had an impression on my mind, on her first coming to tell me she was going to leave me.</p>
               <p>Should you have known the woman, without these impressions on your mind, if you had seen her in any field; should you have known that woman upon seeing her in a ditch or field near your house, without any impression on your mind that the woman was murdered or destroyed? - I believe I could, very safely.</p>
               <p>Do you think you would say that, upon the recollection that the life of another human creature depends in some measure on what you say, that you can say to a certainty that that was the woman that you knew? - I believe I could, very safely.</p>
               <p>Was she altered at all in her colour? - No.</p>
               <p>Not the least altered? - No.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Lichfield-street. On the 8th of November the prisoner was brought to the office in Litchfield-street, and examined by the Justice. After he had been examined some time, the advertisement being read, and describing him in a red waistcoat, the magistrate asked him it he had such a thing; he said he had, but that it was at Enfield. After that, the magistrate desired him to be taken in the back-office, and searched; he was searched, and this key taken out of his pocket, and some other things, which were trifling; money, and things of that kind. He afterwards asked to speak with his last wife, who was there; she told me she was his last wife; and the magistrate suspecting she was going to take away something, as she had a coach ready to go off, I went with her, and searched his box, at his lodgings, in Charles-street, Westminster, with the key; I took from the prisoner, and I found these things in the box. Here is a cloak, a bed-gown, and a coloured apron, and some other trifling things. The cloak appears to be all blood; as full of blood as it could hold. I was desired, by some of the officers of the parish, that we should dry the cloak. We could not make any thing particularly out. There was a cap in the bundle, in which they lapped some of the wet part of the cloak; and since that it appears in this state. The cloak was wrapped up in the bed-gown; and here is some blood in the bed-gown.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the cloak? - It is a black satin cloak. There was a 10 l. Bank-note found in the prisoner's box,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140015"/>which he owned at the office, and I returned him it again: there was a red waist-him found in the trunk also.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you ever examine if there was any blood on the waistcoat? - We did examine if there was any, but there does not appear to be any.</p>
               <p>Does the waistcoat appear to have been cleaned? - I do not know; it is in the state it was. I found this handkerchief, and a coloured apron, all tied up together in the box; except the red waistcoat, which laid on the outside; the handkerchief appears to be clean; there were two course aprons between it and the cloak.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Do you happen to know whether that is blood or no? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Do you affect to take upon you to know it from similar substances? - I take upon me to say that that is blood to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Brace. Look at that bed-gown? - I believe it to be her's; there is no particular mark by which I know it; I have seen her wear such a bed gown.</p>
               <p>Do you know the cloak? - It is like her's; I do not know it; she wore such a cloak; her's was a black satin cloak, and the same of the cap. She bought just such a handkerchief as this. I believe all these things to be her's; but there is no mark that I would chuse to swear to. This handkerchief is of the very pattern of that which she bought at my house that morning.</p>

               <p>Called to prove the second marriage.</p>
               <p>Court. I do not think the relation of that circumstance to this case is necessary. It certainly goes to prove that this man meditated to be guilty of bigamy, his former wife being then living; but it does not prove that he meant to go the length of murdering his former wife. I do not see that it is necessarily connected.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. My only idea was, to shew that this man was asked in church previous to going out with her.</p>
               <p>Court. It is proving upon him another crime, in order to raise a circumstance of general suspicion; and it is general only: it has no relation to any particular fact. It has very often been objected, that that which was an independent crime, could never be given in evidence against a party in another crime: the answer has always been, yes, provided it is a circumstance and ingredient composing another part of that crime; but if it is only a circumstance which leads you to suppose that it is probable that a man may have it in his mind to commit a crime, we never receive it; it is too remote; for if so, all the other bad circumstances of a man's former life may be brought; but that is too general. The obvious tendency of the man in the second marriage, is to be guilty of bigamy.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Does your Lordship think that the proof of these wounds being given by a stick, is sufficient to go to the jury.</p>

               <p>Court to prisoner. Here is a heavy charge against you, and proved by a chain of evidence, that is very pressing upon you; I hope you may be able to give an answer to it. This is the time for you to make your defence: you will be heard with all manner of indulgence, and say what you can for yourself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am not guilty of any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. If you wish to say any thing for yourself, you may, I am not permitted to do it for you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I can call plenty of witnesses to prove where I was at the present time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Your solicitor is not here. Do you know what is stated to me as your defence: did you give the instructions yourself? - I did. They are all over the way.</p>
               <p>Then you wish your witnesses to be called? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Tell the officers, if any one of them is in court, except the one that is called, they will not be examined.</p>
               <p>Court. Let the names of the witnesses<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140016"/>you mean to call, but put down on paper, and given to the other side.</p>
               <p>(The witnesses all called into court, and set to the inner bar, and an officer ordered to take them into the parlour, and bring them out as called for.)</p>

               <p>Do you recollect the prisoner coming to your house at any time, and when? - The 27th of October. I cannot positively say the time of night. I cannot say any thing that happened that day respecting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you see him on that day? - I did.</p>

               <p>At what hour, as near as you can recollect? - I cannot particularly say.</p>
               <p>Court. Not whether it was early in the morning, or late in the evening? - It was after the dusk of the evening. I cannot be particular as to the time.</p>
               <p>Not within three hours? - I sup about nine, and he was there then, but I cannot say particularly the time.</p>
               <p>How long had he been there before you went to supper? - I am not particular. I have a shop to mind, and could not be particular to such a thing. I am sure I saw him in the evening of that day.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt. Do you recollect whether it was in the evening before supper, or after supper? - Before supper. He went to his lodgings. I cannot tell what became of him afterwards. I saw him again the next morning about nine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. How far is your house from Chelsea? - Upon my word, I cannot tell; I never was at Chelsea but once in my life.</p>

             stands indicted for the wilful murder of Silvia his wife, by beating her on the head and face with a stick, giving her there by several mortal wounds and bruises, of which she languished for some time, and then died. In support of this charge several witnesses have been examined; and I will state to you the substance of their evidence. [Here the learned judge summed up the evidence for the prosecution, in the course of which he observed, he would at once state to them; because it was satisfactorily proved by Mrs. Brace, that that woman was the deceased Silvia, the wife of

            ; and that Mr. Gibbs had behaved with great humanity, which did him great honour, and was fit to be mentioned to his credit.] His Lordship then added, I was willing you should see how the case stood, even supposing she had been senseless and had never uttered a word; and it seems to me as if the evidence was of a pressing and urgent nature against the prisoner, even so taken: because, here is this man's wife found in the morning, in this dreadful condition at Chelsea, having set out from Enfield Highway by appointment, with the prisoner, in order to go to a lodging in Holborn; the prisoner acknowledging that he joined her at the Basing house, on the professed business of that journey. That he should join her on the road, and should be at that lodging, there is no account of her ever coming to that lodging at all; but she was found at Chelsea the next morning, having, by all appearance, laid there many hours from the state of the blood. The prisoner afterwards returning to Enfield Highway, and there declaring that his wife had gone on the Tuesday morning to Hampton Court, which was absolutely a falsehood; and coupled with that, as soon as he understands that the people were come down in search of him, he goes off another way; and added to all that, articles of wearing apparel, exactly corresponding with those articles of wearing apparel, which that woman set out with that day, found afterwards in the prisoner's possession, in a state which corresponds exactly with the situation in which that woman was found. If the case stood so unexplained by the prisoner, and he was able to shew you, either that he missed her, or that after he had conducted her to Holborn, and there left her; and that she must in some other manner have found her way to the place in which she was afterwards found, being unable to explain the story he told of Hampton Court, and these articles of dress found in his possession, if it stood so, it would have been a series of circumstances<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140019"/>so urgent and so pressing, that they seem to fall very little short of actual demonstration, equal to the evidence of those that saw the blows given. If I was satisfied that the case was quite full, without this circumstance of her confession, I would not state those circumstances to you at all, as I would not wish that they should make any part of the consideration now before you, because they come under some difficulties. Great as this, and every crime of this nature must always appear to be, the conviction must proceed on grounds of legal evidence; and ordinarily legal evidence consists in the deposition of witnesses, taken on oath, before the jury, administered in the face of the court where the prisoner is tried; and that evidence comes down to the jury, under all the advantages which examination and cross-examination can give. There has been admitted beyond that kind of evidence, two other species of evidence; one is the declaration of the dying person who has been murdered; and that has been admitted under certain circumstances, to stand in the place of evidence given before a jury on oath. Another species of evidence has been, that of examinations taken before a Justice of Peace, having under a particular act of parliament, a justification to take such examinations; and being called upon to send such examinations afterwards to the Court of Goal Delivery, where, if by accident, the party should die before the trial of the prisoner, it should be of necessity substituted in his room. A doubt has arisen among us, to which doubt I subscribe, which is, whether the examination taken by Mr. Read, is an examination of that nature; for the examinations directed to be taken by act of parliament, are examinations taken where persons are in custody, and when the justice hears the examination of witnesses against persons in custody, upon which examination he is to do his duty, either to commit, or to bail: such examinations are allowed to be read after the death of the party. It was a very proper and prudent act of the Justice; but it was a voluntary act of him, at the request of the overseer. Now that voluntary examination is like every other, not taken before the jury who tried the prisoner, and therefore not properly to be received as an examination on oath; but though we must strip it of that sort of sanction, yet still it is the declaration of the party, signed by herself; and you may class it with all those other declarations which this woman made after she was found, and before she died. Now, with respect to that, the general rule by which these declarations are made evidence is this, they are declarations made in extremity, when the party is considered as at the point of death, no hopes for this world, with every obligation upon them therefore to speak truth; and that situation being considered as so solmen and so awful, as to create an equal obligation to that of a positive oath, administered in a court of justice. There is but one difficulty attending these declarations with respect to this woman, and that is, the difficulty of finding out whether she herself apprehended herself to be in such a state, as to be going to answer before her Maker for that transaction. I enquired as to that of several witnesses, but I could not get satisfactory information. The surgeon said she did not seem to be much sensible of her situation, though she was in a dreadful one; apparently dying; but she lay there submitting herself to her situation, and without explaining herself upon this circumstance, whether she thought herself likely to live or die. Now the ground upon which the evidence is to be admitted is, that she speaks under the impression of a situation such as that of a person going to die; and my judgment upon the whole of this difficulty is this, that inasmuch as she was certainly mortally wounded, and was in that condition; for it was difficult to get from her particular explanations as to what she thought of herself and of her situation, when every body about her thought she was a person likely to die: that a declaration made by a woman under such circumstances, ought to be considered<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140020"/>by a Jury, of being made under the impression of considering herself as a dying woman; and that, therefore, those declarations, especially as they were carried on to the last, as long as she was capable of speaking; and, as they were uniform, as long as she must have so considered herself; they may very well be considered by a Jury as given under that impression, and therefore as entitled to a certain degree of credit; how much credit, will always be a matter for the sober consideration of a Jury, when they hear it, and couple it with all the circumstances.</p>
               <p>I know it is possible that persons in such a situation may aggravate from feelings of resentment. It is possible that though they may appear to be in their senses to those that are about them, yet there may be a false train of reasoning. They have possessed such very infirm minds, where the body is so infirm, that there may be, to that purpose, a sort of sensible delirium, if I may so call it; that is, that they may talk with appearance of reason from a false impression made on the mind: therefore I have thought, that though these kinds of declarations may be received, yet they are to be received with a great deal of caution; and are more or less material, according to the particular nature of the particular case to which they are applied. Here, in truth, they have such abundant corroboration, that I am afraid there can be no room at all for hesitation, as to the decree of credit that ought to be given to this woman's declarations, under all the circumstances; as those declarations were uniform and consistent, both to the surgeon, to the apothecary, to the overseer, and to Mr. Read; that she was the wife of Woodcock; was to go with him from Enfield Highway to Holborn; that she set out, he met her at the Basing-house, walked with her a long way; that, when it grew dark, he got her into a bye place, and demanded her keys; that she told him, William, it is time enough to give you the keys when I see the lodging; that, upon that, he gave her several blows, which, in the end, made her senseless, and she had no further recollection of what passed. And if this was the state of the fact, as I am afraid there is too much reason to believe it was, if she had never said it, then there remains no room for doubt, or for explanation, with respect to the case: it must, in that case, be a very barbarous murder, committed by this man in the coolest and most deliberate train of wickedness that the human mind could be supposed to have framed.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, the prisoner has, in answer to this charge, not been able to explain one single circumstance. He has made, indeed, an attempt to produce something like an alibi; but it amounts to nothing: it consists of the evidence of a Mrs. Peach, who tells you that she lives in Charles-street, Westminster, and that on the 27th of October, after the dark of the evening, the prisoner came to her house: that she sups about nine, and he was there, then, before supper; but cannot say what time he came in. Another witness says he was at his lodgings after supper: and that is the whole account he has given of himself, from the time he left Mrs. Brace, at Enfield Highway, at half past two, till the time that he went to bed at his lodging, at past ten. Now it is obvious that, perfectly consistent with that account, every article of the charge may be true; and it brings him to London, and it creates upon himself the necessity of giving some account of himself before he came to his lodgings, in order to avoid the imputation which naturally arises from his having taken upon himself the care and custody of his wife. Having taken her to carry her to a particular place in Holborn,</p>

               <p>she being found in that condition, he is obliged to account for her some way or other, from the time he received her into his care, to the time he was seen in London.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Peach mentioned a circumstance which rather strengthened the case against him; which was, the circumstance of his bringing a bundle to Mrs. Peach's house. She did not see what was in that bundle; but it was a circumstance that the woman set out with a bundle; that she had not her bundle when she was found; and that the prisoner had a bundle, at an hour later, under all the circumstances, than of the time when the fact was committed: and that there had been afterwards found in his box things which might be conveyed in that bundle.</p>
               <p>The rest of the evidence is to shew that he did not abscond; so far it is material for him. He certainly was seen in and about London several times before he was apprehended, after the time this woman came by her death. That there was a woman, when he was carried before the Justice, who appeared in the character of his wife; and there is some reason to apprehend that he married such a woman; therefore he certainly was in about London. In general, to be sure a man appearing openly, against whom there is any ground to lay such a charge as this, is a favourable circumstance. One would not suppose, that a man could have a mind so hardened in guilt, not to wish to fly to the remotest corner of the earth; therefore it would certainly tell, in another case, very much in his favour: what effect it may have in a case so loaded as this is with urgent circumstances, you are to consider.</p>
               <p>There are, besides these, three or four witnesses who speak to his character. The character, if it were better established than it is, weighs but little against a chain of circumstances. You will have to consider, first, there is no doubt but that this woman has come by her death by a violent outrage committed on her person, and that it is murder in somebody.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140023"/>The next consideration is, whether the circumstances of the case do or do not afford you solid and satisfactory grounds to conclude that she did come by her death by an outrage committed by the prisoner, her husband. You see in what manner the circumstances are brought to fix it upon him: he was the person who was last with her, who had undertaken the charge of her, who had appointed her to come from the particular place where she was to town, on a pretence that seems now not to be founded in fact; and having given no account of that, many other circumstances, of a considerable degree of personal share in the outrage. And you will be to consider, whether this is, or is not, equal to that sort of demonstration which arises from the party's being seen by witnesses to commit the fact. The declaration of the woman is, taken with the rest, certainly proper to form a part of your consideration; and, if it be true, reduces that which would barely admit of a doubt, from the rest of the evidence, to that which is equal to absolute certainty.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, this man's fate is in your hands. The public justice of the country requires you should give the case a full and solemn consideration; both for the sake of the public, which is deeply injured by the loss of a subject in the way this poor creature has lost her life, and also the fate of the individual who is charged before you as being the author of it. You will do justice between them.</p>

            , you have been convicted, after the most cautious and attentive examination of every circumstance, and upon the clearest and most satisfactory evidence, of a crime the most enormous that human nature can possibly commit. The crime of murder, in itself, whether we consider the malignity of heart which produces it, or the fatal consequences to society, has ever been considered as a crime of dreadful magnitude: the blood of the innocent is said to cry to Heaven for vengeance. The laws of God, as well as of man, pronounce, that whose sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. The crime of murder, in itself, is of such a degree of malignity, as scarcely to admit of aggravation. What must be the horror of your accumulated guilt, under the circumstances with which this murder has been attended! It has been committed with a degree of savage barbarity and violence, scarcely to be found in the history of the most shocking murders: it has been committed without a shadow of provocation, and against that unhappy person to whom you were united by the sacred ties of marriage - ties equally sacred in the sight of God and man - which bound you to cherish and protect the unhappy object who was so connected with you, and not to be the author of dreadful and brutal violence to herself. The circumstances that attend your case, afford but too great reason to believe, that this proceeded from the most deliberate blackness and malignity of heart; and that you seduced this unhappy woman from her dwelling, for the horrid purpose of putting an end to her existence. God only knows what influenced your savage heart! whatever it was, admits of too little ground for any sort of mitigation. Under these circumstances, you cannot, consistent with public justice and the good of society, expect any mercy from those who are entrusted with the administration of the law. The law is for the public; and the safety of society is, that you should<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140024"/>die; and die you must. Happy will it be for you, if your guilty blood can make any atonement in the eye of Heaven for that horrid crime. The mercy of the Most High bnows no bounds; and from that boundless and infinite mercy alone it is that you may hope for favour. I pray God, that the very short time which remains for you to live may be so employed, which, in the sight of that merciful God, may obtain for you some mercy hereafter. It remains, therefore, only for me to discharge the remainder of my duty, in pronouncing upon you the just and awful sentence of the law; which is, That you be carried from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution; there, on Monday next, to be <rs id="t17890114-1-punish7" type="punishmentDescription">

When we had got to the four-mile stone, we were met by three men, about half after six in the evening, about a quarter of a mile from the four-mile stone. The prisoner took hold of the horse by the reins, and stopped him; they desired my husband to stop, and called him a bloody b - gg - n, and told him to stop, or they would blow his brains out. The other came up with a pistol to the cart, and called my husband a bloody b - gg - n again, and insisted on his money; and my husband said, Gentlemen, have mercy on me; do not hurt me; do not take my life. I have but a little money; I am a poor man; but what little I have I will give you. He gave them what money he had, which was about three or four shillings, I will not be positive; and the man with the pistol came up again, and said, d - mn him, he has got more; he told him he had not; then he said he would blow his brains out. I sat in the body of the cart, and saw nothing but the pistol; I cannot say who that man was. The prisoner, Carty, let go the reins of the horse and he and another came up, and they knocked my husband off the shafts: he got up again, and they knocked him down again. His son being asleep at the tail of the cart, covered over, with the noise he awoke; he jumped up, and asked what all that noise was; and he went to jump out at the tail of the cart, and his smock-frock catched upon something; and the two men came up to the tail of the cart, and he had a tussel with them; and my son seeing a gentleman coming on horse-back, he called for assistance, and there came up two gentlemen immediately to assist; upon their coming up, I got out of the cart, and went to my husband, but which way I got out, I cannot be sure; he asked for a handkerchief as plain as I could understand him. He was laying in the road, and I gave him one to wipe his face. I stood by the side of my husband, and held the horses, while the gentlemen assisted my son. My son never let Carty go out of his hands. Then they secured Carty, and the others jumped over the hedge, and run away. Carty never was out of my sight, till he was secured. We took my husband home in the cart to Enfield.</p>
               <p>Was he sensible? - He was so sensible, that all he said was, My head, my head. He continued so all Saturday, but never spoke after.</p>
               <p>Court. How soon after that did he die? - He died on the Tuesday following. My husband would have been fifty-five years of age on the next month.</p>

We hastened our pace; it was about 150 yards beyond the four mile stone When I came there, I saw the deceased lie motionless on the ground: I saw two other men in the ditch, at the bank of the foot-road, lying struggling; there was a third man standing on the bank of the other side of the ditch: I jumped off my horse, and turned him up, and ran to the two men who were contending in the ditch, and enquired which was the thief, upon being informed, I hit him two or three blows with a small stick - I had in my hand, and feetred him; at that instant, Mr. Franklin coming up, the other man run away. I left the prisoner in custody of Mr. Franklin and young Williams, and got on my horse, and rode after the other: after going as far as I thought he could have got, I came back again: he had gone another way; on my coming back, he had been troublesome to Franklin and Williams; I took the reins of the horse, and tied him, and bound his hands. I searched him, and found on him 1 s. and one penny in money; I then sent for a lanthorn to see for the weapons, and while that was coming, I put old Williams in the cart the cart went off, and I saw no more of them that night.

               <p>I am a surgeon at Hendon. I was called in to this poor man on Saturday night, the 3d of this month, between the hours of eight and nine. I found him sitting by the fire, his wife supporting him; he had received<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140029"/>a wound upon the cheek, just below what anatomists called the zygomatic process, which forms part of the cheek-bone. He was not then quite insensible; he wanted very much to be put to bed, making use of the term, Let me go to bed by all means. I understood he had lost a large quantity of blood, and I apprehended the situation I had found him in, might proceed from that loss of blood, and the extreme coldness of the weather, and the place he was in.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you mean his apparent weakness and lowness? - Yes, Sir; the weather was very cold, and the place where he was dreadfully cold; I was told the wound had been inflicted by a sharp instrument, of which it had the appearance; I dressed the wound, and desired him to be put to bed, and kept warm; I then left him for that night. I was prevented from seeing him so early the next morning as I wished, by being called to examine the head of the prisoner. I went to him at twelve o'clock; when I came there, I was given to understand he had been in a state of insensibility for the greatest part of the night, and found him nearly in a similar state; a tumour had formed considerably above the wound, which, on pressing, seemed to give pain, and occasioned him to raise his hand to the part; from this circumstance, and the symptoms which accompanied, I judged the scull or brain, or perhaps both had sustained an injury. I thought perhaps an operation might be necessary; but the place where he was not being convenient, I went to Mr. Bond, who ordered the governors of the work-house to fit up the best room for him, and to send a cart for him, and a bed and bedding. I purposed visiting him again as soon as he was removed to the work-house; I waited some time, expecting information that he was arrived at the work-house, but not hearing any thing, I went down to the place between seven and eight, where I had first found him; on my going there, I found his friends averse to his being moved; I found the symptoms much increased; judging it necessary, I made a longituninal incision, to come at the state of the case as near as I could, on the tumour; from this I learned that the skull was perforated: I learned sufficiently to make me pretty sure that was the case. I informed the friends there appeared but one thing, and that afforded but little hope, and that I would go down and consult Mr. Bond on the matter, and return again; Mr. Bond and myself agreed it would be right to have a consultation; and in consequence, a messenger on horseback was dispatched to Mr. Goodwin, an eminent surgeon of Hampstead, requesting his advice and assistance; he declined coming on account of the hour of the night, and thinking it an improper time to undertake any business of that kind; but being rather of a different opinion, and thinking no time should be lost, I formed the resolution of going down, and if I thought it necessary, on inspecting the scalp, to trepan the man. I returned again between ten an eleven, and found the man considerably worse, and I found the friends in general unanimous that it should not be done, as I offered them but little reason to suppose it would be effectual; I represented to them, that in the state he was, die he must; but suggested it to be necessary to trepan him, though I could afford them but little reason to suppose it would be of service; the consequence was, that when they declined it, I left the man without performing the operation. I saw him on the following morning; he was then moved down to a better appartment, and had a comfortable bed; he was considerably worse, and had all the appearance of a dying man. I did not see him again till after his decease; he died that night at eleven o'clock. After he was dead, I removed the scalp, and made some perforations near the part where the injury had been received.</p>
               <p>What did you find? - I found the wound of the skull connected with the external wound of the face; the instrument had passed through the arch formed by the zygomatic hypothesis, or process, and entered the skull about three inches above, in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140030"/>an oblique direction, about two inches and a half from the external wound; it had passed under the arch of bones called the rise of the cheek, and entered the skull about one inch posterior to the orbit. I had penetrated the skull, and found the texture of the brain considerably broke; a large cavity was formed; there was a large effusion of blood, so that I could cover my fingers almost without any impediment.</p>
               <p>Do you or not think that that wound was the occasion of his death? - It evidently was.</p>
               <p>PRISONER's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>On this Saturday, this Ryan and Ephernon came to my house, of which I gave information to Mr. Bond, and he gave me his honour he would get me a free pardon; they asked me if I was going into the country to day, I said I should go to get a few oranges; and I got to the value of about half-a-crown's worth; Ephernon asked me if I would wish to go on such an affair with them at that present time. What, to rob? Yes. I answered I would not, while I could earn a shilling or eighteen-pence a day by lemons and oranges, and that I thought it better than to go on that line. Ephernon said he did not care, they would both go themselves. He went and told Ephernon I was not to go with him; in about half an hour they both came to my room; with that, my Lord, they both wished me a good morning, and went off, and told me where they were going to; they knew the walk I used to take with these lemons and oranges; and they met me about five o'clock; with that Ryan seemed to be forward in liquor, and they both began to quarrel and fight; with that they rescued the basket away from me, which contained about sixpenny worth of the oranges which I had not sold; I stood still for a little time, and asked them for them again, and they made answer that I should not have them, and should not go home till they pleased. Ephernon made answer, and said, d - n my eyes, if I offered to go out of his sight, without his leave, he would blow my brains out; I said why? he made answer, that I should perform in the action which he was determined to do; I told him, that if he was to shoot me through the body, I would not go with them that night on the actions they meant; with that we parted; this was about half a mile from the place where the fact was committed. I followed them, and thought to have returned home on the Hamstead road; with that, I heard a hue and cry: I came up, guessing and imagining in my own mind they were doing something amiss. The first thing I observed was, a horse and cart across the king's highway before me: there was no room on the foot way for the snow; I thought to get past the horse, and my hands came to the reins of the horse, and this young man jumped out of the cart, and catched me round the body; Ryan went behind the cart, and laid in the snow, and Ephernon went round the hedge; then there were some gentlemen farmers came up, and gave me several blows, and knocked me down nine or ten times.

               <p>Gentlemen, it is proper I should tell you, that in point of law, if several men go out together upon an illegal purpose, meaning to commit a robbery, and determine to oppose all resistance that may be offered to them in the prosecution of the attempt, if one man kills another, the man that was present, though he is not the hand that gave the blow, he is equally guilty; therefore, if the wound was given by the other man who was in his company, and you are satisfied they both went out on one illegal purpose, he is equally guilty.</p>

            , you have been convicted of a crime of the greatest magnitude of any that is known in the law. The crime of wilful murder, an offence which not only the laws of this country, but of every civilized society, have judged it indispensibly necessary to punish with death. Your case affords a melancholy instance how naturally the commission of one crime leads on to another; for though there is reason to hope that you did not go out with a deliberate purpose to take away the lives of your fellow-creatures, yet that guilt was the natural cause of the unlawful purpose for which you associated with others; and the life of an innocent subject has fallen a sacrifice to your crimes. It therefore becomes necessary for the safety of society, and to deter others from offending in the like, that your sufferings should hold forth an example to those who cannot be restrained from the commission of crimes by any laws, human or divine. Happy will it be for you, if a sincere repentance of your guilt should obtain for you, that mercy hereafter, which the law must unavoidably deny you here. It is necessary that persons guilty like you should suffer; and it remains only for me to discharge my duty, in pronouncing upon you, the awful sentence of the law; which is, That you be taken from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of execution; there, on Monday next, to be hanged by the neck until you are dead; and your body afterwards to be dissected and anatomized pursuant to the statute; and the Lord have mercy on your sinful soul.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I beg the benefit of clergy.</p>
               <p>Court. The law denies it you, and the justice of the country must be satisfied.</p>

               <p>I am a saddler. These three saddles were offered me for sale; one was my own make, I knew. They were offered by King, the prisoner. I do not know the other. Six bridles were offered with the saddles. I told Lovell, the baker, for whom I had made one of the saddles. I informed Justice Wilmot, and obtained an order to search a place in Plow-yard. I was afterwards informed by another man, such articles were there to be sold, and King was in the room then, and offered them for sale. I went afterwards with one Mr. Green, to whom a part of the property belonged, and who had got a search-warrant; and we found part of the property which is now in court, at this apartment. The things have never been out of my possession. I do not know how they came there.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole. I heard some people on this building, and I stopped a little while, and I heard them say now. I drew my cutlass, and took two of them into custody. The lead was on the ground, in the passage, and the two men were close by the lead. I called to my partners, but they did not hear me; and the two men refused to stay, and the prisoner came up at me with a stick in his hand. I said, you rascal keep away, or I will do for you, for I know you well. He then began to strike, and I was obliged to let the man go, and him too. They all ran away. I took the lead to the watch-house. I went in pursuit of the prisoner, knowing him: we knocked at his landlord's door, and I heard somebody frisk down. I took the prisoner before four o'clock; when I laid hold of the other two men, one or two others rushed away, when I heard somebody say now, I heard a great noise, and I suppose the lead fell.</p>

She took me to her lodgings; I gave her some money to get it, and I fell asleep. I was awaked by her trying to get a ring off my finger; and she then said, here is the gin, do you chuse to drink? and I drank some, and asked her to shew me the way out to the street; and she ran across the road, and left me; then I missed my watch, and my leather bag, in which I had my money; there was half a guinea, and some silver; and after that I could not find her. I went to the watch-house, and gave information; and the watchman went out, and soon after brought in the two prisoners; my watch was brought back by the watchman. I was in liquor; I had been drinking from two o'clock that day, and it was then between nine and ten. I had not looked at my watch after I went into the woman's apartments; I saw it about half an hour before. The watch was in my fob, and the leather bag in my left-hand breeches pocket: if she took them, it must be when I was asleep.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor came to the watch-house, and said he had been robbed of his watch and money; he was a good deal in liquor. I went upon information to the prisoner Walters's lodgings, and I found the prisoner Dearman with her. I told him they must go to the watch-house, and then I heard something fall, and then I saw the watch lie at Dearman's feet. The woman said she had just picked up the young man in the street; and when the watchman came to the door, she gave him the watch to hold. I found in her pocket half a guinea, four shillings, and six sixpences; going back again, I found this leather case, which the prosecutor owned.</p>

I saw the prisoner at the bar look first at one door, and then at another; I saw the prisoner at the bar take a pot, and throw his handkerchief over it; I asked him what he was going to do with it, he said he was going to get milk in it; I said I'd tell him about milk; I then laid hold of him, and took the pot from him, and a quart pot from under his coat; and there was another pot taken out of his pocket. I got assistance, and he was taken to Lichfield-street, and committed.</p>

I said, Gentlemen, don't go to hurt me, I hope you won't hurt me; I am a poor man, like yourselves. The man with the tuck said, don't make any hesitation at all, or I'll run you through instantly. Then I pulled out what trifle I had, it was but a shilling, and the man that had hold of me by the shoulder took it out of my hand, and the other d - mn'd me, and bid me go along. I went on as far as Ball's Pond Turnpike, and there I met Sir

            's men, the patrols, and I gave them information directly. I know the man that put the tuck to my breast; the outside one is the man. It was a moon-light night; it was close by a hedge; I had an opportunity of seeing his face by the light of the moon. He kept the tuck stick opposite to me, and swore he'd run it into me. I had notice of their being taken last Monday week: I saw them at Bow-street; they were shewn to me as the two men that were taken up. I knew the face of the outside prisoner, Hathaway, directly; they did not shew me any body; I said, directly, this is the man that robbed me. There is a deal of difference between their conditions now, and when they robbed me; for they were both in sailors dress. I will not positively swear now to either.</p>

               <p>On the 14th of December we came up with the prosecutor, who informed us he had been robbed by two men in sailors habits, and a tuck stick; we looked about for them in the public houses about Holloway, and we could not find them. On Sunday week afterwards, we met two men, in sailors dress; with this tuck stick, by the Shepherd and Shepherdess Fields. We took them in custody, and took the stick from them.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutor. Had you any opportunity of particularly observing this stick? - It was a knife-blade, or a razor, and sharped off; it had several knots on it. That is the stick I had hold of; I am sure that is the stick.</p>
               <p>Mr. Peatt, prisoner's council. Was you ever in Exeter 'Change? - Not these three years.</p>
               <p>Have you been through Fleet-street lately? - No.</p>
               <p>Have you been down Snow-hill? - I very seldom walk about.</p>
               <p>Perhaps you never saw a stick-shop in your life? - I never saw such a stick as that, with a tuck in it. It was a yellow stick, with a blade; I have no doubt but it is the stick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Hathaway. I bought the stick<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140037"/>at Portsmouth; I gave 3 s. 6 d. for it there. I was just come from my lodgings to get a shirt, last Sunday night was a week, and the runners took me up.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Hathaway called six witnesses; who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of January, I lost my watch, between twelve and one at night. I was coming home, and I fell down, near to my master's door. I had been in the city. My master's name is Minees; he lives in the <placeName id="t17890114-21-crimeloc106">Strand</placeName>

My foot had slipped against the kerb, which occasioned me to fall down. When the prisoner had taken my watch, I got up immediately, and pursued him; I caught him by the flap of his coat, at the corner of Buckingham-street. I called the watch three times; and during that time the prisoner threw me down twice, and strove to get away. The watchman came up to my assistance, and he was then secured, and taken to the watch-house. The watch was found, the next morning, in an area, the corner of Buckingham-street, by the maid-servant, about eleven o'clock. I am sure the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140038"/>is the man that took my watch; I saw him take it out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Court. Was you drunk or sober? - I was not quite sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Silvester.</p>
               <p>On your oath, Sir, was not you excessively drunk? - I was not: I had been drinking too much.</p>
               <p>You say your foot slipped, and you fell, near to your master's door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Then you must have tumbled down forwards? - No, I rolled on my back.</p>
               <p>Did not two gentlemen come up just at the time you had got hold of the defendant at the bar, and was accusing him of having robbed you of your watch? - No, not till the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>Did not two gentlemen come up to you, and say, young man, mind what you are about; you are very much intoxicated with liquor? - I saw nobody but the prisoner till the watchman came up.</p>
               <p>How long had you been laying on the ground before the prisoner came up to you? - About a minute and a half.</p>
               <p>Court. Does a sober man, when he falls, lie a minute and a half on the ground? - If I chose to lay there, I might.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. I hope your lordship will take notice of his answer.</p>
               <p>Did not you ask the watch-house-keeper, the next morning, to shew you the person you had charged the over-night? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you should not know him again? - I did not say any such thing.</p>
               <p>On your oath, when you charged the prisoner, did not two gentlemen come up to you, and say, they had watched the prisoner, and that he did not meddle with you? - No, they did not; they came up, and went on, and I followed them to Buckingham-street.</p>
               <p>You advertised this watch afterwards? - I did.</p>
               <p>The prisoner advertised it likewise, in the same paper, offering a reward of five guineas? - I did not see the advertisement.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that that advertisement stood next to your own, in the same paper? - I don't know; I did not look at the advertisement.</p>
               <p>(The advertisement put in by the prosecutor, and the advertisement put in by the prisoner, read from the Daily Advertiser.)</p>
               <p>You was not cautioned you say, by any body, to be careful, and mind what you was about, on account of your being so excessive drunk? - No, I was not.</p>
               <p>You was not sober the next morning, when you went before the magistrate? - Yes, I was.</p>

               <p>I am a watchman. About half past twelve, on the evening of the 6th of January, coming up Charles-court, I heard the cry of Watch! twice. When I came up, Cope gave me charge of the prisoner. It was near Buckingham-street, at the corner; Cope had him by the flap of his coat. Cope said he had robbed him of his watch; I said, mind what you are about, be cautious, this is a street robbery. Two gentlemen came up, and asked what was the matter: they said they would not go with such a drunken fellow to the watch-house; I said he need not be afraid to go, if he had done nothing amiss. We conducted him there.</p>
               <p>Was not Cope very much in liquor? - Not very much; he had drank a little too much, and he was a little sick in the watch-house. I heard that the watch was found the next morning, in Buckingham-street, down in the area.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was he very much in liquor? - He was in liquor, but he knew what he said; and he said the same the next morning, before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>I am a timber-merchant; I live at Cuper's-bridge, Lambeth. I was walking home, on Twelfth-Night, with Mr. Wheeler; we had been at the Bolt-in-Tun, in Fleet-street. At the end of Southampton-street the prisoner passed us with a gun on his shoulder; he walked faster than us. When we came to the end of Bedford-street, a man had hold of him by the flap of his coat, and said he had robbed him of his watch; it was by the pillars of Coutt's, the banker's door. The instant we came up, the watchman came up, and he was charged; the watchman rang his rattle, and another came up; the prisoner did not offer to run, as I saw. They went to the watch-house; they crossed the road, and went on the right-hand side, and turned up Church-court. They crossed directly opposite to Coutt's door; I followed close behind. The prisoner did not offer to make the least resistance, or to make use of his gun; he went very quietly. The prosecutor was very drunk, excessively so; he belched in the room, and was ready to be sick. When I first came up, he was not on the ground. I am not clear whether the prisoner, after we first met him, had got out of sight, or not; it could not have been above two or three hundred yards.</p>

He could not say directly where; but it was at one corner or the other of Buckingham-street. In the first place, I believe he mentioned George-court.</p>
               <p>Court (reading the information.) He himself was coming up Charles-court? - He mentioned, first, that it was opposite the end of George-court.</p>
               <p>Court to Cooper. What court was you coming up, when you heard the cry of Watch? - I was coming up Charles-court. I heard the cry of Watch, twice; and I thought it was somebody called Coach.</p>
               <p>Court. The other watchman does not attend here; nor was he examined before the Justice.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to Mr. Wilmot's. I had a warrant against the prisoner, Walker, for an assault. On the 19th of December, I went to <placeName id="t17890114-24-crimeloc118">Leg-alley, Shoreditch</placeName>

I knocked at the door, and a voice answered in the room, Who is there? I said it was Armstrong; and in a minute the door was unlocked; there was a little sort of jingling as appeared to me, to my ear, while I was on the landing-place: when I came into the room, the prisoner, Walker, was sitting on a chair by the fire, and Grace by the side of him; there was in the room a woman and a girl besides. I then acquainted the prisoner, Walker, I had a warrant against him for an assault, I smelt an odd kind of smell in the room; and I asked Walker when it would suit him to come to the office; he said to-morrow, at eleven. I left the prisoners in the room, and ran back to the office as fast as I could; when I came there, I found Harper and Shakeshaft; we returned to the room as soon as we could; we went up stairs as softly as we could; the door was on the latch; I lifted it up softly, and in we all three went to the room; I says, there is the money in the chair; at that time, Grace, the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140043"/>was by the side of Walker, and he moved his hand by his side; and at that time, some base pieces fell from his hand. There was some money in the chair; and as Walker got up, some fell from his lap; it was picked up, and here it is; ten pieces. Here is a piece of black stuff, I do not know the name of it. Some of these pieces were on the chair, and some fell from his lap; but in securing the prisoner, it was all mixt together; that that was in the chair, and that that fell on the ground.</p>
               <p>Did you take up that money which you saw fall from Grace, when you got into the room? - Mr. Shakeshaft picked up that; the other officer picked up some other things; the two prisoners and the woman were taken before the magistrate; the child was discharged. I found 12 s. but one by accident has been melted; this one was part of them that were on the ground. It was tried on a shovel this morning, and was made the colour of brass; it was then put by Mr. Vines into some aqua-fortis; he made it boil, and afterwards rubbed it with a little sand; and it then turned as white as ever. I saw nothing else; but the ashes appeared to be wet; with what I cannot tell.

The door was opened, and we all rushed in, in a moment; Walker was sitting down by the fire, and Grace was standing up; and Armstrong said, there is the money in the chair; Walker got up, and as he got up, some of the money fell down on the floor; Grace had some in his hands, which he threw away; this, I believe to be the money he threw away. I found it wide from the other, in the way that he threw it. When I went down to fetch the woman, I found this bottle; I smelt the bottle, and I smelt a sulphurous smell. I knew the smell of aqua-fortis very well; I am certain, on my oath, there had been aqua-fortis in it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Was there any cork in it? - None. It had been rinsed out; and I put it at my nose, and it burnt the end of my nose; I afterwards gave it to Armstrong to smell. It had been rinsed with water. The woman was washing close by the fire. There had been a bit of string round the neck of it, and it pulled to pieces like tinder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Keys. Is it now in the state you found it? - There were some little drainings in it.</p>
               <p>In what part of the room was the woman washing? - Quite close by them; by the fire side.</p>

               <p>Recollect, because you know you have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140044"/>been examined before, and what you said was put down before? - It was some liquid, but what, I cannot take upon me to say.</p>

               <p>Do you say you had a doubt when you was examined before? - Yes, Sir; I thought I heard him say to Grace, here is the aqua-fortis. I did not see him do and thing with it.

               <p>Why, did not you take him up with a warrant? - Yes; that is three months ago. That was for beating of me.</p>
               <p>You say there was no money coloured, that you saw, in the room? - None, that I saw.</p>
               <p>They were all white, that you saw? - Yes; when he came and laid them on the table.</p>

               <p>Was you and Walker confined in the same room at any time after you were taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was taken up first as a party concerned in this business? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards admitted an evidence? - Yes.</p>
               <p>After you was taken up, was you and Walker confined in the same room at any time? - No.</p>
               <p>Have not you had a conversation with Walker since he was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him, that you was compelled to say something against him, and threatened if you did not? - Yes; I said I must tell the truth.</p>
               <p>Did not you say you was threatened to say what you should say? - I did say, one told me one story, and another told me another story. One told me I should be hanged, and another, I should be burnt. Several told me so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Do you mean to say, that what you have said now, and said at the Justice's, is not truth? - What I have said now, is the truth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Walker. Did not you say, that Armstrong threatned you, with a stick to your head, when he was left with you in the room, if you did not say so? - They told me I should be hanged and burnt, if I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140045"/>not say so; they did not hold a stick up to my head.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Walker so? - I do not know whether I did or no; I may have said so.</p>
               <p>Court. When the liquor; whatever it was, was poured into the bason, what was done with it afterwards? - I did not see; I believe it was thrown under the grate.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether the money was or was not put into the bason? - I cannot take upon me to say.</p>
               <p>Prisoner, Walker. Please to ask her, whether she has not now a person under sentence of transportation that cohabited with her? The woman is of a very foul character; her evidence is hardly worth taking.</p>
               <p>Court. I think you had better ask Armstrong that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester to Armstrong. You hear what he says, that this woman has been in custody for other crimes before, and that a person she cohabited with is now under sentence of transportation? - I apprehended her upon a charge, and she was discharged before the magistrate, without fee or reward on my part; and Mr. Vernon himself took this examination. I then said to him, in the face of the magistrate, before this woman; Sir, says I, I asked her if any one officer has said one word to her; I beg, Sir, that you, as a gentleman, will do that; and it was put to her, and she said No.</p>

               <p>Did you learn from them what the use was? - I believe Walker mentioned, the first time he came, that he was liable to take bad silver, and it was to try the silver, whether it was good or bad.</p>

               <p>Mr. Silvester. By what process could you distinguish it? - If it is bad, it turns green on the surface, and if it is good, it turns black.</p>

               <p>I am a partner with Mr. Vernon, the Sollicitor for the Mint. I tried this piece. I burnt it black, and took it out, and put it into cold water and rubbed it with sand; that turns it to this colour; and this black stuff deadens the white, which makes it look like old money. We put it into aqua-fortis, that makes it black; then it is rubbed with sand, that makes it too white to pass; and then that white is deadened by the blacking. Here is one I tried. I restored it to the brass colour, then I put it into aqua-fortis, and afterwards in water; then I rubbed it with sand, and then I rubbed it with that black stuff.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of last month, in the evening, I was standing in the pit-passage leading to <placeName id="t17890114-29-crimeloc139">Drury Lane play-house</placeName>

I have my watch now; it is here.</p>
               <p>(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>It was returned to me on Sunday the 7th of December, about twelve. There were twenty-three guineas in my purse.</p>
               <p>Court. That was five days after.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen, prisoner's counsel. This was at the pit-door of Drury-lane? - Yes; in the passage, some time after five.</p>
               <p>That place is not very light, of course? - It was light enough.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, it was very much crouded? - Very much crouded.</p>
               <p>Did it occur to you, to see any lady near the prisoner at the time? - No, I did not; I do not recollect in particular; I believe there were women there.</p>
               <p>Can you, in the middle of this croud, take upon you to say, that the prisoner was absolutely the next person to you? - I can, for this reason; because he spoke to me; and while he was pressing against me, he told me there would be a great croud, and that we had better edge towards the door.</p>
               <p>It did not occur to you, perhaps, to see this circumstance. You did not see him speak to any lady there? - I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you hear any lady next him ask what o'clock it was? - I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Did you see him pull out his own watch, to tell any lady what it was o'clock? - No, he did not; I am sure he did not, while he was engaged with me.</p>
               <p>I believe the prisoner was searched by Macmanus? - I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Nothing was found upon him? - Nothing belonging to me.</p>
               <p>You was before the magistrate? - I was.</p>
               <p>You said there, I believe, very fairly, that you did not know that the prisoner was one that took your watch? - I could not swear positively that he took my watch.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Are you enabled, from the observation, and the conversation that passed between you and the person next you, to say, whether the prisoner is the man that was next you, or not? - That is the man.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this a night that Mrs. Siddons acted? - No, Sir; it was a night that Mrs. Farmer acted.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. I understood you, that at the time you lost your watch, was the exact moment when the pit-door was opened? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Were a number of people behind you? - There were; they were pressing to get forward.</p>
               <p>I put the question to you directly; did it appear to you, before you felt the hand at your pocket, that the press was occasioned by the crowd of people, by endeavouring to get into the play-house? - Sir, before the door was opened, the prisoner and another man pressed very hard against me, one on each side of me; so hard, that my hands were raised up.</p>
               <p>At the moment of the door opening, which naturally increases the press at that moment, did it, before you felt the hand at your pocket, occur to you any thing else than that the press was occasioned by the people crouding to get in? - I felt the hand at my pocket some time before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140048"/>door was opened, and I endeavoured to make way.</p>
               <p>Did not it appear to you that the persons next you had other persons next to them, and pressing upon them? - A great number; but those two persons were so situated, I think it was impossible that any other persons could have done so.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you feel any blow on your head at the time your hat was pulled forward? - No. If you will give me leave to put my hat on, I will shew you.</p>
               <p>Court. If you please, Sir.</p>
               <p>(Puts on his hat.)</p>
               <p>It was tumbled in this manner (throws it off, over his face); it was occasioned by some small force that was behind me; it occurred to me that it was on purpose.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an officer belonging to Bow-street. I was at the play-house the 2d of December. I know the prisoner; I was in the passage leading to the pit. The first thing that took my attention, was hearing the prosecutor crying out he was robbed; and I rushed forward to the place where he stood, and I found the prisoner at his right-hand, and the other man, Conolly, on the left. I caught them both in my hands. I said to a man, hold this fellow, for I see a watch in his hand; that was the prisoner. Now I will not swear that I saw a watch in his hand, but I swear I saw something like a watch-chain hanging down. When I laid hold of him, he immediately raised his hand; his hand was down before.</p>
               <p>Court. His hand was shut, apparently with something in it? - Yes, in this manner. (Clenched.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. Was any thing hanging down? - To the best of my knowledge there was; but I cannot say positively. I think, to the best of my knowledge, I saw part of a chain hanging down in his hand.</p>
               <p>It is a very material fact for you to recollect? - I will not positively swear it.</p>
               <p>First, did you see any thing at all hanging out of his hand? - I really think there was part of a chain hanging out of his hand.</p>

               <p>Does your doubt apply to whether there was any thing, or whether it was a watch-chain; are you positive as to there being any thing in his hand? - I think I did see part of a watch-chain in his hand.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you did? - I really think I did; I am very positive I saw something, but I will not swear it was a watch-chain.</p>
               <p>Are you sure you saw something? - I am certain: when the gentleman laid hold of Conolly that was on my left-hand, he got away from him, and ran across; and whatever was in the prisoner's hand, he took it out, and ran away through the pitpassage, and got off. I saw him put his hand to the prisoner's hand, and take something out, and run away immediately; I cried, stop him, he has got the watch! and with that the prisoner at the bar pulled out his own watch immediately, and said, this is what I had in my hand - this is what I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>Are you sure that was what the prisoner said? - I am sure of it. Then I took him to Bow-street, and the prosecutor went with us.</p>
               <p>Jury. Do you think, at the time he took out his own watch, and said, this is what I had in my hand, that he had time to put that watch in his pocket again? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>You found nothing upon him but his own property? - Nothing belonging to Mr. Bellingham.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. This was about five in the evening, in the pit-passage? - It might be a quarter after, or twenty minutes.</p>
               <p>There was a very great crowd? - There was a great crowd.</p>
               <p>You rushed forward on this call, and seized two men? - Yes.</p>
               <p>One of which made his escape, the other did not? - No.</p>
               <p>You are pretty well known, Macmanus? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A man could not at all be ignorant of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140049"/>the cause of your seizing him? - Not in the least.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, that if a man's hand was down, the best thing he could do was to have dropped the watch? - I do not know, Sir. They know very well what to do in these cases.</p>
               <p>Jury. I understood you, that when he held out his hand, you saw him give something to the hand of the other? - No, Sir; I saw the other put his hand to the prisoner; but I did not see any thing pass.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. You do not say that you saw any thing pass from the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>And, in point of fact, you do no not know whether the prisoner might not put his hand into his pocket after? - I do not know what he did with his hand after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When the prosecutor was before Mr. Bond, I asked him if he could say whether I took any thing from him; he said, no, he could not. I never offered to go from Macmanus. I was crouded as much as Mr. Bellingham was; and I did not rob him, any more than he robbed me.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called ten witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

On Monday, the 22d of December, about two in the afternoon - there were two pieces of linen put out in the morning - a gentleman, about two, came and enquired if there were not two pieces put at the door; he was answered, yes: he said he would shew which way the person that took them went. There was then a piece missing; they were joining to the window, on the ground. We pursued and took the prisoner, running into Wardour-street out of Noel-street, with the linen on his shoulder: it was Mr. Starey's linen; it was the piece that was missed; we took it from him, and secured him.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of December, about six in in the evening, the prisoner came into my shop, under a pretence to buy a silk handkerchief, and some linen; he looked at some, and desired to know the amount. I served him myself; I told him the amount; and he was considering a little. There was nobody in the shop but him and I. I was busy putting some things off the counter, and he ran out of the shop. My man who had been out, came in that instant he had ran out, and desired to know whether I had sold the prisoner a piece of check; I said no. I looked round, and missed a piece of check; on which my man ran out immediately, and in a few minutes he returned, and said he had catched the man, and delivered him up a charge to the patrol. I went out with my man, and saw the prisoner in custody; I knew him to be the same man that came into the shop. I afterwards had him taken before the magistrate.</p>

I had been out on the 13th of December; and, on coming home, I saw the prisoner come out of the shop-door with a piece of check: I had my suspicions, and I asked Mr. Peyton if he had sold a man a piece of check just now; he said, no. I immediately ran after him; I saw him running, and I called out, stop thief! A coachman ran after him, and took him. He was out of my sight a few minutes; the check was not taken on him, he had dropped it. I saw him at the place where it was dropped by; I did not see him drop it; I only saw him coming out at the shop-door; I did not see him before. I am sure he is the same man; I saw him running; I saw him when he was taken.</p>

The man went up Princes-street; from there, up Castle-street; from there, up Bolsover-street; then, through Margaret-street, into Cavendish-square; and across the square, into Welbeck-street.</p>

               <p>Prosecutor. The man was in my shop about five minutes: it is a light shop; I am sure he is the man; he was dressed very shabby; he had a round hat on, a little over his face. I rather suspected him, till he told me a tale about something, that he was a working man, and was going to the pay-table.</p>

I did not know he was taken up till Monday. As I was coming down Oxford-road, I heard a parcel of people calling, stop thief!

               <p>On Friday last was a week, the 9th of this month, between seven and eight, I was coming down Petticoat-lane, and I met the prisoner with a load on his head; he passed me: two men followed him; whether they were in company with him, I cannot say; they said, d - n your eyes, what are you nosing at. The prisoner crossed to an iron shop, one Cowell's and I secured him and the property. He said he worked for Mr. Caney, at fifteen shillings a week; the next day his master came and saw the property, and said it was his.</p>

               <p>About eighteen months I lived a servant with Alderman Swain; having a wife, mother, and child to maintain, I took two lower rooms in Long-alley, and paid eleven shillings per month; I bought and <rs id="t17890114-39-deflabel185" type="occupation">sold houshold furniture</rs>

I kept it on about six months, and took another house in Long-alley, and paid fourteen pounds a year, and bought some other things; then I used to stand under Whitehall Chapel; and there I bought these things of a lady. At this time, the Lord was pleased to afflict me with a fever, and I was obliged to depend on my benefit club; and after the Lord was pleased to raise me out of my affliction, I came to enquire for work of Mr. Caney, and I took a room just by, and brought all this property into the room; and last Friday evening was a week, I was carrying a load for my master, and one of my shoes burst open, so I could scarce walk; so I said to my wife, I will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140053"/>go and sell this property, and buy a pair of shoes. The things were bought of different people; the lady I bought some of lives at the house adjoining to Whitehall.</p>

On the 15th of December last, I worked at one Mr. Morgan's, at Shadwell; I saw two men before me; they parted and let me go between them; one of them, the prisoner, seized me by the collar, and said, d - n your eyes, you b - r, what have you got; I told him nothing material, only a few halfpence in my jacket pocket; I desired them not to use me ill. The prisoner held my back up against the pales, and put his finger into my handkerchief that was tied round my neck, and twisted it round, and almost throttled me, while the other searched my pockets; they took three-pence halfpenny, and a farthing out of my jacket pocket, and a clasp knife; the prisoner took the handkerchief off my neck, after the other had done searching my pockets, and then left me for about half a dozen yards; and the other came back to me, and would have given me my handkerchief, if this prisoner would have let him; but the prisoner said, d - n your eyes, you b - r, sherry, get off with you. I immediately went across the fields into the direct road to Shadwell, to go back again to Shadwell, to give information to the Shadwell officers. Going along, I crossed the fields into the new road, and got into Ratcliffe Highway, and there I met the prisoner and the other man coming along; I passed them on purpose to get the first I could meet with to assist me; and I met two men, and asked their assistance, and they said they would; I immediately jumped in between the men, and took one in one hand, and one in the other, but nobody assisted me, and I was obliged to let one go; and the prisoner I took to the office myself. He was searched, and nothing was found upon him. It was about five o'clock, as nigh as I can guess, when I met them; and this might be about ten minutes after, not more. I ran as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>How far might it be from the place where you was robbed, to the place in Ratcliffe Highway, where you took the two men? - About a quarter of a mile; but then they went a round about way to it: I crossed the fields.</p>
               <p>What part of Stepney-fields; was it? - About one hundred yards off one side of the halfway-house.</p>
               <p>And you think it is about a quarter of a mile from Ratcliffe Highway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>At five o'clock, the 15th of December, I suppose it was dark? - Yes, it was duskish.</p>
               <p>Why the night was set in; is that footpath lighted? - No, no lights.</p>
               <p>Both the men strangers to you? - I never saw them before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Was it light enough for you to distinguish their dress? - Yes. That man had a blue jacket, a silk handkerchief round his neck, check cotton shirt, white trowsers; the prisoner had a round hat.</p>
               <p>That is the common dress in the seafaring line, and amongst workmen who work on the sea-side? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140054"/>When you met him in Ratcliffe Highway, did you hear him speak? - No, I did not. I am positive he is the same man; I knew them by their dress; and the other had a handkerchief swinging in his hand, which I did suppose to be mine.</p>
               <p>What, when you met them in Ratcliffe Highway? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Could you distinguish the colour of the handkerchief? - No, I could not.</p>
               <p>You came immediately from work? - Yes; I had not stopped any where.</p>
               <p>Quite sober? - As sober as I am now.</p>
               <p>Could you observe, at the time you left them in Stepney-fields, which way they went? - Yes; I saw them go towards Shadwell; they went a round-about way to it: I went across the fields. I was afraid to follow them in the path-way.</p>
               <p>Would the way that they took lead them into Ratcliffe Highway? - Yes; it was the direct road to it.</p>
               <p>Did you come from Mile-end down Ratcliffe Highway, or the other way? - I came into Ratcliffe Highway from Tower-hill way, by the way of the New-road; and then I went down the New-road, and I met them.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, you will recollect, that the man's life depends a great deal on your testimony; in the dark, and the dress a common one, and nothing found on the man; are you quite positive he is the man? - Quite positive that he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. All you knew him by was his dress? - By his dress, and his face.</p>
               <p>You never saw the men before, neither of them? - Never, to my knowledge.</p>

               <p>On Christmas day last, about a quarter past two in the morning, (I am a watchman in Hosier-lane) I met the prosecutor; he was out of order; very drunk. I took him in hand, in order to take him home; and I waited till the patrole came by; the prisoner, who is a patrole, came by. I kept the prosecutor till he came; and I told him I had a drunken man in my box; he said I had no right to keep him in my box. I assisted him to get home, near to Cow-lane; he said he lived in <placeName id="t17890114-41-crimeloc194">Fox and Hart Court</placeName>

We took him there, and laid him down in the court to rest; in two or three minutes afterwards, the prisoner came behind him, as he was laying on the flags in the court, and put his hand under the prosecutor's leather-apron, and put his hand in his pocket, and took something out, and put it in his own coat-pocket; then he lay the man down, and said to me, go you on your duty, and I'll go on mine; he went about ten or twelve yards, and I said, are you going to leave the man there, and take the money out of his pocket for your own use; he said he knew nothing of the money; I said, give the man his money, and help me home with him: he denied it; and I took him by the collar, and brought him about five or six yards; and he struggled, and d - d the man, and said he knew nothing about the money. I said you had better give the poor man his money; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140055"/>said, I have got it, and I'll give it to you; well, says I, let's see how much it is; I said, had you any of your own; no, says he, only three farthings; he then took out the half-crown and four-pence, and said, here, you take it; no, says I, go and put it into the man's pocket; no, says he; and my lanthorn was open, and he put it in. I then asked him to help me with the man home, and he did; we found it out, and I gave his wife the money. The prisoner was present.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you tell his wife where you had got that money? - I did not. The prisoner came away with me past my box, and said he took it only to keep it safe for the owner. At three o'clock he left me at my box, and went to his duty. The next day being boxing-day, I would not report him before, that he might have his Christmas-boxes; a day or two after that, I did report him to Mr. Ashford, and he was afterwards taken up. I would not have believed it, unless I had seen it, if a hundred had told me. I have known him five years, and always thought the prisoner was an honest man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Upon your oath, was you sober or drunk? - Upon my oath, I was sober, I was no more drunk than I am now.</p>
               <p>Do you know Hollingsworth, a watchman? - Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Did he see you that night? - Yes, I believe.</p>
               <p>Do you know Carty? - No, nor M'Carty.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner pay the money to the woman? - No; I did.</p>
               <p>Do not you know Marlow has worked for the prisoner's brother? - I heard so.</p>
               <p>Did not the prisoner tell you he would have you fined for having a drunken man in your box? - He did.</p>
               <p>You told him you would give a charge in the watch book against him? - That was when he refused giving me the money.</p>
               <p>Then you never reported him? - I never mentioned it to any body, till I told Mr. Ashford.</p>
               <p>How long has he been patrole? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>For some years? - No, no years.</p>
               <p>As long as you have been a watchman? - Not a quarter of the time.</p>

I had a pocket-apron, that I wore; I had nine shillings and sixpence in one side, and two shillings and sixpence, in halfpence, in the other; I had just before told it. There was nobody in the house but she and me; she lodged in the house for about three weeks. I went to take a nap, about twelve o'clock, on the bed; she covered me over; I had my pocket-apron on; I laid down upon it; I went to sleep; I was awoke by my husband; the prisoner was gone; the pocket-apron was cut at the bottom of each side, and all the money gone; there was only one farthing left. Last Thursday was se'nnight she was found by my husband; she was found in bed at her mother's room; she went away in triumph; she did not come back again. I gave her her bed for three weeks, because she said she was in distress. I never got my money again. She took away this bed-gown with her: it lay under the bolster, at my head; I found it on her bed, at her mother's; she was in bed.</p>

               <p>I am husband to the last witness. I came home on the 15th of October, between two and three. The door was looked; I knocked at the door; and nobody coming, I looked through the window, and saw my wife's cloathes turned up over her middle; then I knocked again, and she got up, and let me in; it is a spring-lock; and what things she had in her pocket were tumbled about the floor; her pockets were cut. When I went out, I left nobody in the house but my wife and the prisoner. The prisoner had a room in the house, and paid three-pence a night. We never got the money again. I went out about two, as near as I can guess, before she laid down. We found the prisoner with my wife's bed-gown on.</p>

               <p>I obtained a conditional pardon, and that was obtained before my mother died.</p>
               <p>Mr. Akerman. He says there is a pardon in the Recorder's Office.</p>
               <p>Townshend. There certainly is such a pardon. I went down with this lad to Portsmouth, and the captain told me to find out his friends, and send them down to take him away, for he had received orders to discharge him. I have seen the pardon, in the name of Ward.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The captain set me at large; I waited on him afterwards.</p>
               <p>Dixon. I called at the Recorder's Office myself, and Mr. Jones, the Recorder's clerk, told me there was a conditional pardon; but that the prisoner had never availed himself of it, and it was of no use. He was to enter into sureties to transport himself; and he never did, but made his escape.</p>
               <p>Mr. Recorder. If there is any such pardon, which I am inclined to believe there is, it is on condition of leaving the kingdom, and giving security.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Campbell ordered me to be set at large; and if you write to the captain, you will find it to be true.</p>
               <p>Court. Care will be taken to enquire.</p>

He went out, and said he was going to Leadenhall-market. I was in the kitchen; a woman brought me the bill down; her name was Hutchins; it was on Christmas-eve, or Christmas-day; she said Mr. Weston desired I would get it changed, and pay myself. On the Christmas-day, in the morning, I was dressing the prisoner's hair, and he said he'd go out and buy something, and get the note changed; the note was in a wine-glass, in the kitchen. He said, you shall go with me to Mr. Roberts's, in Bond-street, and we'll have a Twelfth-cake; we did not go that day. On the 26th, he said to me, you have got a watch to raffle; we will put it up at the Green Man, in Bond-street; so he made out a raffle for my watch, and put ten people's names to it. We sat there, and drank three pots of beer; he went out, and came in again, and said, he had had good success, and the note would be taken up on Saturday, at three o'clock. He said the watch should be raffled for on Monday evening. We came away; and on the Saturday morning, he went away from my house, and told me to go to Mr. Roberts's, in Bond-street, to get the note discounted, and keep the balance till he returned. I went to Mr. Roberts, of Bond-street, on the 27th of December, and offered the bill for discount; he told me to go and see if Mr. Hatchett would accept the bill, and Mr. Hatchett stopped me with the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. This bill is the same bill that the prisoner told you to get discounted, and keep the balance till he returned? - Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>(The bill read, as in the indictment.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's council. What are you? - I am a hair-dresser by trade.</p>
               <p>Is that the only trade you follow? - Yes.</p>
               <p>The only way you get your bread? - I let my lodgings in the best manner I can. I have a wife and four small children.</p>
               <p>Who lodged in your house? - They are unfortunate women; the best lodgers I can get; sometimes they pay me, sometimes they do not.</p>
               <p>Then I understand you keep that sort of house, the resort of a number of bad women? - My lodgers are the best I can get, and I never suffer any noise or riot in my house.</p>
               <p>You was taken up yourself for this? - Yes, I was stopped with it. Nobody ever could say any thing against my character.</p>

I brought the bill for 5 l. 3 s. 6 d. down to Brannon on Christmas-eve, or Christmas-day; Mr. Weston gave it me; he came in on the 23d of September, and gave it to me, and told me to lock it up in a drawer. I did; and on Christmas-day, when we got up in the morning, he told me to give it to Brannon, to get it discounted, and pay himself, and to keep the change till he came back again. I gave it to Brannon. Mr. Weston did not go away till the Saturday morning, which was the second day after Christmas-day. The prisoner had lodged there about a week or ten days. I had known him near a twelvemonth, but was not acquainted with him above a month or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's council. He went out, I believe, with a person of the name of Boston? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was not much pleased with that, I understand? - I did not say any thing concerning it.</p>
               <p>You made use of some expressions of dislike? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it a man or a woman that he went away with? - A woman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's council. I believe you said, d - n my blood, I'll be a match for you for this? - No, it was not that.</p>
               <p>What was it? - I cannot say positively what it was; but I am sure that was not it. I said it to himself, when he was going into the coach; and nobody was present<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140059"/>but myself and the man and woman that went out with him.</p>
               <p>Was not there a man of the name of Farthing that heard it? - No, there was not; I do not know such a person.</p>
               <p>You are in that unfortunate way of life, I understand? - Yes; he lodged with me. I was very much displeased at his going off with Miss Boston: I cannot remember my words, but I did make use of some threats.</p>

As I was going up Piccadilly, to go to Dover-street, I felt something come behind me, and feel the leather; the ends of it hung down. The people often feel my leather as I go along. This was as I first entered Piccadilly, next the Haymarket. I did not turn back at that; they felt it again several different times. When I came almost to St. James's Church, there was a man behind me pulled the leather very hard. I turned round, and saw a man, whom I find to be

I got up a second time, and laid hold of him by his arm; he struggled, swore, and either d - n your eyes, or b - st your eyes, you b - h, let go! and he got from me; I saw no more of him. This was just by the cabinet-maker's window, in Dover-street. I was much alarmed. I am sure the prisoner is the man; I could swear to him above all men; I never saw him before. It was not very dark, and the lamps gave a very good light. He was apprehended the next day, (Sunday) by the particular description I gave of him. I first saw him as they were taking him to the Justices; the constable asked me if I I knew him, and I picked out the prisoner directly, from among a parcel of men. I don't think the whole transaction took up above five minutes.

I staid there nearly half an hour; when I came out I missed my coach, and I said to the watering-man, I have lost my coach. A man came up, and told me that such a coach as I described had gone down Argyle-street. I went to the top of the Haymarket, and gave notice at the stand there; then I went to the High-ground, Piccadilly; and while I was talking to a man, one

Gittal said, there is your coach, I went and caught the near-side horse by the bridle, and stopped them till I had an opportunity of jumping on the splinter-bar. The prisoner, Holmes, who was driving, said, d - n your eyes! what do you want with me? He kept beating the horses, and driving on, and I endeavouring to stop them. He was endeavouring to pass the rank; and opposite the third coach,

On Thursday evening, the 15th of January, about ten o'clock, the prisoner and another man came into my house, and called for a pot of porter; and they staid a quarter of an hour, and drank it; and I desired them to make haste, because it was the time for shutting up. The other man offered me a bad half-crown; I would not take it, and they found halfpence then. They went across the tap-room to go out: the other went out first; Haynes came out afterwards, and caught me with his left-arm, and lifted me up by the waist twice, and I missed my watch directly. I went out after them; I caught hold of Haynes's coat; I thought I felt something that was not right about my watch, and I missed it directly. I caught him about forty-five yards from the door; I took him by the coat, and I told him he had got my watch. Says he, will you say so? Yes, says I. Then he and I had a struggle, and he flung himself off the foot-way into the road; he got from me, and ran towards Brentford-bridge;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140066"/>and he was there headed; and he then ran back, and I followed him, calling out, stop thief! and a man came out of my house, and took him. He was sent to the watch-house. The watch was found afterwards in the snow, where we had the scuffle; we got candles and lanthorns, and searched, and the constable picked it up. It was a silver watch, with a steel chain, a base-metal seal, key, and hook. I am sure the watch that was picked up is mine; I am sure the prisoner is the man. I had the watch, I am sure, in my pocket; I saw it ten minutes before I lost it; I told them what it was o'clock, and told them not to keep me up. I know it by a bit broke out in the face.</p>

               <p>I am a bricklayer. Me and another man were in the house drinking a pint of beer. These two men came in, and called for a quart. The prosecutor pulled out his watch, and said, gentlemen, I hope you will not stay long; it is ten o'clock. After they had drank their beer, there was confusion about a bad half-crown, and they paid halfpence; they went out afterwards. On hearing the prosecutor cry out, stop thief! I went out; and I saw the prisoner coming up the street, and I laid hold of him. I am sure the prisoner is one of the men that were drinking in the room. I heard the prisoner lifting the prosecutor, but I did not see him; I could tell by his breath that the man was squeezing him. When we had taken him, we went out afterwards with a candle and lanthorn, to search. It was about a quarter of an hour afterwards; and there we found the watch. I am sure the watch is the prosecutor's; I know it by the paper in it, which I cut myself.</p>

After we had got about a hundred yards, he came out, and took hold of me, and said I had robbed him. I said I had not, and I got myself away from him; then he cried, stop thief; and another person came up, and I went up to them, and they took me. I never saw the watch. I sent for my master, to Brentford, but he could not come.</p>

               <p>I knew both the prisoners. On Wednesday the 7th, I was at a Mr. Bishop's, a publick-house, about a quarter after six in the evening. Mr Lay was drinking crank, and I was drinking beer. It is in Sun Tavern Fields, about two hundred yards from Cole-stairs. Rutledge came in, and asked me if I would buy two iron bars of him; I had nothing to do with them, and I said I would not buy them off him. Rutledge is a <rs id="t17890114-51-deflabel262" type="occupation">waterman</rs>

Rutledge went away, and Lay came in and drank his crank out; after I had drank my beer, Lay asked me if I was going home, I said yes, to get some tobacco; he said he was going to his shop to get a man, and that he had agreed with Rutledge for the iron; afterwards he came to our stables, about five minutes afterwards, and asked me if I had seen any thing of Rutledge, I said no; if he wanted him he would find him about Cole-stairs; in about five minutes I saw Lay come out of Mr. Shepherd's yard, just by Cole-stairs, with a bar of iron; it was then about half past six; then he pitched it against the corner of a house, and said, I think I can carry another, bring me another out; he said it to either Rutledge or Freeman, I do not know which; Freeman and Rutledge were there when I saw Lay coming out; then Lay carried them about forty yards, and pitched them by the side of a house, and said he could carry them no farther. He gave one to Freeman to carry, and the other he carried himself. I did not see Rutledge till we came to Mr. Bishop's, the publick-house; Freeman and Lay carried it to Lay's house. About half an hour afterwards, Rutledge, Lay, and Freeman came to Bishop's; and Lay put his hand in his pocket, and gave them two half-crowns and a shilling; Freeman then said, is this all, and Rutledge replied, no; I got one shilling coming along.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner Lay's counsel. Was you with them during the time? - No. I walked with them going up to Mr. Bishop's again; about forty yards.</p>
               <p>Was Freeman in the stables with you? - No. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Did not you refer Rutledge to Lay to purchase the iron? - No; that I swear.</p>
               <p>Did not you go out with Rutledge to the door? - I can neither say one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Do you owe Lay any thing? - Four or five shillings; he asked me for the money, and threatened to set lawyer Dyke to work at me, if I did not pay it.</p>
               <p>Was not the money for this bar-iron first offered to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Silvester. You was to have no part of the profits of this? - No, not a farthing.</p>
               <p>Court. When Rutledge came in, he first, you say, applied to you? - Yes; Lay heard him talking about bars, and he said he would buy them. I told him I would not buy any thing of him.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell him who you would recommend him to? - I did not recommend him to any body.</p>
               <p>Remember you have been examined before, and I have your examination in my hand. Did not you tell Rutledge that Mr. Lay would buy them of him? - I told him they would not do for me, they might do for a blacksmith.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him that there was a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140068"/>blacksmith by, that might want them to shoe his horses? - I think I might.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath, did not you tell him Mr. Lay was there, and would buy them? - Yes, I think I did.</p>
               <p>Why did you tell that gentleman (Mr. Knowlys) a little while ago, that you did not recommend Lay to Rutledge. Did not Rutledge ask you for the key of your stables to put the iron in? - Yes, he did; and I told him he should not have it. I went to do the horses up.</p>
               <p>How came you to go just at that minute? - It was a quarter past six, and I generally go at that time. It is the way to Cole-stairs.</p>
               <p>Did not you tell him you was going to the stables? - I did not tell him so.</p>
               <p>Recollect yourself? - Yes, I think I did tell him I was going to the stables.</p>
               <p>Why did you tell him you was going to the stables? - I might have told him so.</p>
               <p>Did you or not? - I think I might.</p>
               <p>Why did you tell him so? - He said he was going towards the stables; and when he came to the stables, he asked me to let him put the iron in, and I said no.</p>
               <p>What business had you to leave the stables, and go to Cole-stairs? - That is where my dwelling is.</p>
               <p>How much did the iron weigh, upon your oath? - I do not know; no more than what Mr. Lay said at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Was not you by when it was weighed? - No.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that? - Yes.</p>

               <p>I am a constable. I went to Lay's house about four, and afterwards about half after five in the afternoon of the 8th Instant, and there I found this iron. I am sure it was the 8th. Lay was not at home, and I took Freeman with me, and he picked out some bars, of which I took three away to the office; they were not right; and I left them at the office, and went and took Lay, and brought him to the office; and he said they were not the right bars, and that he would go back and fetch the bars. I found Lay in his shop; he said his name was Lay; he came with me freely. The magistrate sent us for the bars; and Lay shewed me the bars, and brought one of the bars in his own hand; he said he had them from Freeman and Rutledge;</p>
               <p>(Bars produced.)</p>
               <p>these are the four bars that he himself picked out. I was present at the examination before the Justice; there was no threats made use of, nor promises made to him. I saw Mr. Staples sign the examination, and Lay also.</p>

About six in the evening he went out of the booth, and told me to stop there till he came back; he returned in half an hour, and said he had got a man to buy the iron; we took two bars from the lighter that lay along-side, and carried them over the ice, and laid them against Mr. Shepherd's wharf, Cole-stairs; then he went away and brought Mr. Lay and

               <p>I am a waterman and lighterman. On the 7th of January, I went into a booth on the ice, about twenty-five yards from the <placeName id="t17890114-52-crimeloc268">ship Themis</placeName>

I went out of the booth, and returned back afterwards, and saw the two prisoners take two bars, one after another, out of the barge; they carried them to another barge that lie near the shore, and then they came back again, and sat and drank in the booth; they said they had spent seven shillings in the booth, and that they would have forty-seven shillings by the morning; I staid, till three or four in the morning. I heard one of them say,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140070"/>they are safe enough, take care of the pop, don't let that go off; I went into a boat, and kept a watch, and I heard the prisoner, Rutledge say, Yeo-ho! I heard a bar drop; I pursued after them. Rutledge had one bar, and the other another; Freeman was there a part of the time. I secured two bars that were on the wharf, and the other bar was taken on the ground, by a young fellow.</p>

               <p>The bars were taken, at night between twelve and one, out of the lighter. I was on the deck of the ship; it was my watch-night. I am sure the two prisoners were both concerned, and another man. I saw them take the bars out of our barge, and put them in a west country barge.</p>

I discovered it on Tuesday morning when I got up about six; I was the first person up; when I went into the bar, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140072"/>found the till was forced from it's place. It was not locked, but two long nails were drove through from the top, to prevent it coming out totally: it would come put so far as to put a person's hand in, but not wholly. There was no lock to it.</p>
               <p>Was the bar quite inclosed? - Yes; the door of it was not locked. All the halfpence were gone, till and all.</p>
               <p>Was there any thing left in the till on the over-night? - It was almost full of halfpence. I had been out, spending the evening, and came home about half past one; my wife and a servant sat up for me. We always examine the till over-night; it holds almost three pounds. When I came down in the morning, the servant went to open the windows; they open into a court; and he found them put to; and, on my examination, I found the shutters of the back-parlour had been opened by a crow, and the bolts which fastened them within-side were wrenched off. The bolts all run from the inside. It appeared to me, that there had been a hole bored in the shutters with a gimblet or an augre, or something of that kind. The window-sashes are within the shutters: the sash was down; there was nothing to fasten it. There appeared to me to have been plain marks of force on that window; that window is between five and six feet high; the window looked into a public paved court. I examined the beaufet in the parlour, and found that had been broke open also. The servant-man fastened those shutters over night; he is here. The castors were gone; and a felt hat, that hung up in the parlour, and an apron, which my wife put into the bar the same night; it was a linen apron, with a particular mark upon it. They drank about half a bottle of rum, and took away about half a bottle of brandy; which I believe was the means of their being discovered. The two prisoners had used my house about three or four months; but finding they had no visible way of getting a livelihood, my wife desired they would not come there any more.</p>
               <p>Court. What are you so delicate in Rosemary-lane? - Yes, so delicate to keep away people of this description, if we know it.</p>
               <p>I am very glad to hear it. - I have nothing further to say about it; the other witnesses will describe the manner of their being apprehended.</p>

At a quarter past four, almost half an hour, the two prisoners came by me; the tall man came first, I believe his name is Norrington; they came by me in Widegate-street, Bishopsgate-street; and when he came almost to me, he dropped an iron crow: I did not know at that time that it was an iron crow for certain, for there was a deal of snow and ice on the ground, which made the noise not so loud. The shortest man, Craig, stooped, and picked it up. I followed them about a hundred and fifty yards. The tall man, Norrington, slipped down again, aside the place; and the other man, that had the crow, made his retreat back the same ground that he formerly came to: I followed him, and mended my pace; and when he found I gained ground upon him, he dropped the iron crow, and ran away. I went to stoop to pick up the crow, and slipped down on the ice, and hurt my left knee. My light went out, and I called to my comrade watchman to stop him; he stopped him immediately, before he was out of my sight. I said, Bob, hold him fast, for I have got his play-thing. His play-thing! he said he did not know what that was. I went up with the crow. He was taken to the watch-house, and searched; and in his waistcoat pockets there was found a quantity of halfpence: that was the prisoner,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140073"/>Craig. I wished to go on my stand, to find the other; I went back to the spot where I saw the tall man fall, and there I found him laying; I desired him to get up, but he was intoxicated in liquor. We got him up, and took him to the watch-house; he was searched by the superintendant to the constable, and in his right-hand coat pocket was found a quantity of halfpence, and in his left-hand coat pocket was found a white linen apron. Mr. Bailey took the apron out of the man's pocket, and I believe he has it in his possession now.</p>

               <p>Was he, at the time you stopped him, in sight of your comrade? - I will not positively say whether he was or no. It was just at the turn of the corner: my comrade was in Sandwich-street; he was out of my sight.</p>
               <p>The man that you stopped, at the time your comrade called, what was he doing? He was running. I could not see exactly where my comrade was, but I heard his voice in Sandwich-street, at the corner of Widegate-alley.</p>
               <p>Was he sober or drunk? - He was middling. I took him to the watch-house, and the officers of the night searched him; he had a quantity of halfpence. But I cannot tell the name of the man I stopped; it was the tallest man. (Craig.)</p>

               <p>Milner. This is the crow I received from Jolly, and I marked it. By order of my Lord Mayor, with my brother officers, I was desired to go to the prosecutor's house, to see whether the place that was wrenched corroborated with this crow. I went there, and the beaufet, or cupboard, this part exactly fitted with it. I afterwards went round, with my brother officers, and there were three purchases that fitted entirely with this end of the crow.</p>

               <p>On the 29th of December last I was asked to go to a club, at the French Horn, in High Holborn, to spend the evening. I went there; and in the course of the evening I came down, and I saw this young man in the tap-room: knowing him, I asked him to spend the evening, and he went up with me. It being Christmas time, and a number of young men there which I knew, I staid rather longer than was prudent, which is the occasion of my coming before this court; and in coming along, a young man asked us to go home with him to his lodging, as we were both in liquor. We agreed to it; but when we came there, it was past two o'clock, and we could not get in. We went into Drury-lane; and there finding a house open, we had a glass, and made the best of our way to Spitalfields, this young man coming along with me; he said he did not know what to do; I told him I believed I could get him into my lodgings. At the end of the new cut which leads to Bishopsgate-street, he stopped behind; I did not miss him for some minutes; I walked on slowly, and came to Long-alley; I called, and he did not answer. On my calling, two men came from out of the ruins, where they where building. I knowing he was behind, thought to wait for him; accordingly, I went up to this part to ease myself, and I saw something lie white on the ground, which I found to be these halfpence and the iron crow. I took it up; this young man called after me; I took the halfpence. Seeing the watchman in the street, I threw the iron bar on the ground; thinking it was a dangerous thing, and of no consequence. Turning down Catharine-wheel-alley, being very much in liquor, I tumbled down; and was stunned, which the watchman knows: nor did I know this man was taken, till I saw him the next morning in the Poultry Compter.</p>

               <p>On Monday the 29th of December, being very sharp frosty weather, and having had no employment for some time, I went to this house.</p>
               <p>Court. In what way of life have you been? - In the earlier part of my life, I was put apprentice to a bricklayer; but having had a fall, and not having served above a twelvemonth, I left it, and have since lived <rs id="t17890114-54-deflabel286" type="occupation">servant</rs>

I went abroad to Africa, along with the black poor, to that new settlement, Searleone. Mr. Angerstein not having a vacancy in his family, he wished me to go to work, to one Mr. Sudor, at Greenwich; which I did, till the frosty weather set in so intense, that I came up to town to see for employment; and I had a suit of cloaths, which Mr. Angerstein had made me a present of; and I took those cloaths to a brother of mine, and sold them to him for one guinea. He not having gold nor silver enough, he made an agreement to pay me part in halfpence, and part in silver. I told him I had no objection to take the halfpence, if they were good; he said he would not promise that, but what had halfpence there were among them he would change, and give me silver for them. I received thirteen shillings in halfpence from him; they were done up in papers; I counted them, to see if the quantity was there, and put them loose in my pocket, with intention to take them home: and going from there<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140075"/>across Bishopsgate-street, I met with one Mr. Bond, who was second mate of the Vernon, the ship I went abroad in; he invited me to go into a public-house: I went with him to the top of Oxford-street, to see his sister; there I dined, and stopped till about seven; when I parted with him, as he was going to stay there all night. I came to the French horn, in Holborn, and sat down in the tap-room, and called for a pint of beer. This other prisoner came down stairs; he knew me before, and asked me to come up and spend the evening with him; which I did. We stopped there till nearly two in the morning. There being a young man there, a friend of this young man's, who saw we were both intoxicated, he invited us to go to his lodgings, in Great Wild street; when we came there, he could not make his landlord hear. I wished to get home, being uneasy at having the halfpence in my pocket. We three, I believe, had a glass or two at the bar of a public-house, and then we parted with the young man; and coming along with this prisoner, he said I might go and sleep with him; which I agreed to. Upon coming through Moorfields, just by the watch-house, I stopped: I heard some noise in the watch-house; I went round to see what it was. There was some watchman had taken up some girls of the town; I stopped some time looking at them, thinking this young man was with me; but he had got before me I followed him across Bishopsgate-street, towards the end of Wide-gate-street, he stepping rather on before me, and I coming up behind, kicked against something with my foot; I stooped, and picked up that iron bar. I followed him down Catharine-wheel-alley, nearly towards the bottom of it, where I entirely lost him. Not knowing where his lodging was, I concluded to go back to a night-house in Bishopsgate-street. I had this iron bar in my hand, which I dropped down; it might feel cold to my hand. Coming out at the end of Wide gate street, the watchman stopped me, and searched me, and found the halfpence, and eight shillings and sixpence in silver. The prosecutor said he had lost no silver, and the Lord Mayor ordered me to have it again. Nor did I know that this young man, while he was absent from me, had picked up that apron, or these halfpence, or the bar.</p>

I came home at half after five; I live in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140077"/>Charles-street, Westminster; the child was not at home.</p>

               <p>Have you taught her to say her catechism? - Yes. I sent the boy to look for her; he went, but could not find her: then I went myself. When I came to the door, to go out, I met her at the door crying, saying, mother I have been robbed. She had no frock, no cap, no tippet.

At the bottom of New Tothill-street I met the two prisoners; and we used to go to the Treasury very often, to get two or three halfpence; and I asked them why they did not go; and the big one made answer, I will not go for this good while; and the little one said she would not. Then I asked them what they had done, and they said, nothing; but I promised them I would not tell; and they told me they took a frock, a tippet, and a cap, off a little girl, in the Treasury.

Then Wade said, I wish I had not not done it, to the big one; and the big one said, it was your own fault. Then the little one said, I was in a good mind to have chucked the child down the necessary; and I wish I had done it.</p>

The little one was taken up before, for stripping a child, and chucking her into a ditch; only she was too young. This was the Monday evening, the Monday before last, between six and seven o'clock; it was the same night it was done.</p>
               <p>Did they give you any part of the eighteen-pence? - No, Sir; I never had a farthing.</p>
               <p>When did you tell of this? - The Saturday.</p>
               <p>Who did you tell it to? - This gentlewoman; I went to her.</p>
               <p>How came you to go to her? - They told me the child lived in Charles-street, at the shoemaker's; and there is but one shoemaker's in Charles-street.</p>
               <p>Had you and they quarrelled between that day and the Saturday? - No, Sir; we did not quarrel at all.</p>
               <p>How came you to go? - I only went because I thought the gentlewoman would have her property again, the child's frock, and cap, and tippet.</p>
               <p>Had you no other reason for going than that? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Who advised you to go? - Nobody advised me to go, and nobody told me; but the woman that took the cap off her head, that little one, robbed her of every thing she had; and Mrs. Matthews took the cap off the little one's head, and said she would ask the gentlewoman. Them two girls, and a boy that was in Bridewell, were telling of it; and Mrs. Drummond, Mrs. Matthews's mother, heard them talking<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140078"/>of it; and when they robbed her, she went to the board to try to get a shilling or sixpence; and she tied a string about her door, and the little one owned she untied it and took her things; then Mrs. Drummond asked her where they were, and she would never tell; so she told me; both the prisoners, and another boy that is in Bridewell, told Mrs. Drummond themselves; and when the little one would not pay Mrs. Matthews a shilling, she took the cap off her head, and said she would tell this prosecutrix. I know Mrs. Matthews; she did not advise me to tell the woman in Charles-street.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of St. Margaret's parish. This M'Killan, and this little girl, came to my house about a quarter past ten last Saturday night, and M'Killan telling me the story she has related, I said, are you sure you are right; she said I will shew you. I went to apprehend the parties. I went to the woman that had the cap, the corner of the court, just by where the other girl lived; I do not know her name; then I went to the lodgings of the little prisoner, thinking to get it out of her; there I found the child's tippet in the room; from there, the girl went along with me, and we apprehended the tall prisoner; and the little prisoner told me, that the big one wanted her to put the child down the necessary. I put them both into Bridewell. I went to the pawnbroker's that night, and saw the frock.</p>

               <p>And your catechism? - No; I cannot say my catechism.</p>
               <p>You have told me, do not you know, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140079"/>difference between telling a lie, and telling the truth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you be sure to tell me the truth, to tell me all you know about this? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You know, when you say your prayers, you pray to God to take care of you, and to protect you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Well, and he will be good to you, if you speak the truth? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And if not, you must expect to be punished? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Now tell me how you lost your frock, and your cap, and your tippet? - John sent me to the Treasury-yard for a bottle of water, there I saw these two girls, and they asked me to fill the bottle for me, and so they broke it; and they took me into the necessary, both of them, and said they would get me another bottle, and bid me not cry; and the little girl pulled off my cloaths, and the biggest girl staid with the boy; and the little girl pulled off my petticoats, and put them on again; and the great girl staid till the boy came with the bottle of water.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the girls before? - I saw the little girl sweeping the streets.</p>
               <p>How often? - A good many days; almost every day I went to the Treasury.</p>
               <p>Had you ever seen the great girl? - No.</p>
               <p>You did not know her? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know either of them now? - I know the little girl.</p>
               <p>When did you see them afterwards? - Not for a good while.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see her again? - No.</p>
               <p>Was you before the Justice? - Yes; and the big girl too.</p>
               <p>Were the two girls that were before the Justice either of them that stripped you? - There was the little girl that stripped me.</p>
               <p>Was that the same little girl that you saw before the Justice that stripped you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>As to the great girl, you do not know any thing about her? - No.</p>

               <p>How came you to let them strip you? - I did not know but they would give me another bottle; they bid me not cry; the little one did.</p>
               <p>But you knew very well they had no business with your cloaths? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Why did you let them? How came you to let them take away your cloaths? - I thought they were going to put on my cloaths again; and they ran away with my cloaths instead of putting them on again.</p>
               <p>How came you to let them take them off? - I did not know they were going to strip me.</p>
               <p>But you know they did take off your frock? - Yes; and they took off my two petticoats, and my pocket, but they put them on again.</p>
               <p>That was all that they did to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Nobody beat you? - No.</p>
               <p>Nobody hurt you? - No.</p>

            . How old are you? - Going of eleven.</p>

               <p>Have you no friends? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Are they not here? - No; they live at Westminster; they was here to-day, only they could not come in to me.</p>
               <p>PRISONER WHITING's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I am going in fourteen: I have no friends.</p>
               <p>Have you a mother? - Yes; she lives at Westminster, in Peter street.</p>
               <p>- WADE.</p>
               <p>Are you the mother of that child? - Yes, I am indeed; she was ten years old last December. I have a husband, he is a drover.</p>
               <p>Court. I hardly can ask you how your child has behaved; for I am afraid you are as much in fault as she is, by not taking proper care of her, and keeping her at home, and making her industrious; letting<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140080"/>her run about the streets, was the sure way to lead her to the place where she is now; therefore I ought rather to ask you, what you can say for yourself then for her? - It is the other girl that induces her out, when my back is turned, to go a begging with her. I never brought her up to go a begging; all the butchers know me well. I have a great family of them.</p>
               <p>I hope you will take better care of the rest, or else they will all come to the gallows.</p>
               <p>Court to Jury. Gentlemen, I am distressed how to state to you, that this is a less crime than robbery; because, though there is no such violence as would affect the constancy of a grown person, or alarm them; yet the very circumstance of such a child falling into the hands of two strangers, young as they are, standing over her and stripping her, does seem to me to be equivalent to holding a pistol to the breast of a grown person; therefore, I cannot state it to be any thing less than robbery; the consequence of that is, that they must answer it with their lives. Therefore you are to consider, whether the fact is sufficiently established against both or either of these prisoners. Now, that this child was drawn away into this privy by somebody, and was there stripped of her cloaths, stands so clearly established, that there can be no doubt about it, upon the evidence of Mrs. Forward.</p>
               <p>Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, and then added -</p>
               <p>For the sake of example, I cannot recommend to you, if you should be of opinion that the crime is sufficiently fixed upon them, I cannot recommend to you to say, it is of a less degree of attrociousness than robbery: the tender years of these persons may be a circumstance to be attended to in other views; but as to the denomination of the crime, I think it would be a dangerous thing to society, if you were to be induced, by any humanity, to lower the offence at all below the rank of actual robbery. So that if you say, that they are both, or either of them guilty, I think you must say they are guilty of the crime for which they stand indicted, robbery, and not larceny.</p>

               <p>What did near you to observe the door? - Sometimes I am up and down stairs twenty times in the day, and I observe it on account of my neighbours, because her door is near the stairs; and between seven and eight, I went down, and saw the door open, and the padlock hanging.</p>
               <p>Did you happen to know that Mrs. Hilton was out that afternoon? - I did not know she was out; then my fright was so great, I hastened up stairs as fast as I could to call assistance; and about two minutes after this, when we came down stairs, the fore-door was wide open, and all her things were gone; that was about half past seven. I am sure, upon my oath, that at six I saw the door secure.</p>
               <p>Court. Who bolted the street-door? - That was after the robbery was committed. I do not know whether I did, or whether the man up stairs did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. You did not try the door at all as you went by? - Yes, Sir; I always do when I turn to go into the yard; I put my hand to it, and it was safe, and the padlock on.</p>

On that evening, about seven or ten minutes after, I went to the door to go down further into the Fryers, to a house there, and I observed a person standing at Mrs. Hilton's door; I was going to speak to him; but I saw it was some stranger, and I did not go any farther; my situation might be about eight yards distance. I went to the office with the prosecutrix; the goods were shewn to her; they were owned; and I went the day following, when the prisoners were brought up, and seeing the prisoner at the bar, it struck me the middle prisoner was the man I saw; I believe he is the man; his name is

               <p>I am an officer at Mr. Wilmot's. I, in company with Lucy, Shakeshaft, and Harper, on Tuesday, the 30th of December, went to the lodgings of Hannaway, by information; we found a quantity of goods. Harper and Lucy were in the room. There was a knock at the door; that was about eight; we were there before day-light. Lucy and Harper went down stairs: I heard a noise; I went to the assistance of Harper; I took Cole from him, and brought him up stairs, and searched him immediately; and found in one pocket this black silk cloak, and this waistcoat in another.</p>
               <p>Was it you or the other officer that knocked at the door first? - All of us.</p>
               <p>Did you get in immediately? - No, Sir, they answered, they would not let us in, Lucy called to me, they are throwing something out of the window: I being the lightest, went round, and secured the property.</p>
               <p>Was there any body with Cole? - I was not soon enough; they took him from Harper directly.</p>
               <p>Did you find any thing in Hannaway's lodgings? - I saw a number of things found, which Shakeshaft has got. The things that were thrown out, are nothing in this business at all. I searched the prisoner Happy, after he was brought up by Lucy and Harper: I found this pincushion upon him; that was all I found upon him; that was in his pocket. I asked Cole where he lived; he gave me his key, and and a direction to Marybone; I went, but could find no place. Happy refused giving us any answer at all. I never found their lodgings.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's council. What alarmed you first, was a noise in the street? - Yes. Here is a bit of lace, which I found in Cole's pocket; it was doubled up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These things are mine; this bit of lace I know; I sewed it together to make a lappet to a cap; I have had it many years; I could swear to it any where; and I know it by having sewed it together: there are two yards of it, and another two yards of another sort. The cloak I know by my own mending and making. The waistcoat I know; it is my son's: I put a piece of dimitty down the back, to keep him warm, one day when it was cold.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hilton. I know this waistcoat perfectly well; I am sure it is mine.</p>

               <p>I am another officer of Justice Wilmot's. I went, in company with Armstrong, and Shakeshaft, and Lucy, on Tuesday, the 30th of December, to these lodgings. We were there some time before the door was open. Me, Lucy, and Armstrong, were up in the chamber, looking over a many things that were there; and I heard somebody knock at the door: I went down to see who it was; Lucy came down after me; and as soon as I opened the door, I saw Cole and the other prisoner at the door with these two bundles in their hands; Cole had this, and Happy had this. I laid hold of Cole, with the bundle; the other threw the bundle down, close to my feet. Lucy pursued him, and took him within a few yards, in my presence. I saw this bundle in Happy's hand. There were some things found in Hannaway's room belonging to the prosecutrix; Shakeshaft has them. This is the bundle that Cole had.</p>
               <p>(Opened, and shewn to the prosecutrix.)</p>
               <p>I know this handkerchief, by cutting it out in the neck: it was very large; and they were not worn so large then.</p>
               <p>Court. Pick out two or three of the things that you best know, and can give the best marks of; but you may speak generally, as to your belief, of the rest.</p>
               <p>This apron I know by a little darn at the bottom; I know it by that, and the binding of it is my own. This cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140086"/>gown is mine. I can swear to it, by mending it and wearing it; I know the gown.</p>
               <p>Have you looked over the other things in the bundle? - Yes; and what I said was mine, is mine.</p>
               <p>What are the rest of the articles in the bundle? - These belong to my son.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hilton. This is my coat; I know it by the buttons, and a kind of seam that I think is under the left-arm. They are remarkable buttons, in the shape of a heart, inlaid with white; and a piece of cloth has been cut out of the pocket, and seamed under the right-arm. This waistcoat I know is mine.</p>
               <p>Court. Now remove these things, and open the bundle that Happy had.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hilton. This is my sheet; I know it by my making, by the hem: they are not marked; there is another, the fellow of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hilton. These breeches are mine; they are jean; and they have been stained by tea, just under the pocket-hole, which has made a white mark, and I know them by that; I am quite certain of them.</p>

               <p>Here are some things that were taken out of the prisoner Hannaway's room. We found this hat, and this sheet, and these handkerchiefs, before the men came there; and this other sheet, this footman, and this bolster. When Mrs. Hilton came to the office, I recollected the footman being in the room, and I took the prisoner out of Bridewell; she had the key, and took Mrs Hilton to the room, and these things were there. When we got up into the room, after she opened the door, I said to her, who lives here? says she, me; says I, nobody else? no, says she, 
nobody else. I asked her who the goods belonged to; she said, to me. I went to 
fetch a person that had broke open another house, on Saffron-hill; and, in the mean time, Harper and Lucy had taken Cole and Happy. We asked her who these things belonged to, and she said they were her's. After we had 
found them, and the things were owned, she said somebody had brought them there.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That footman is mine, and this bolster is mine, and this is the fellow to the other sheet; and this I had just turned, and it is worn on one side.</p>
               <p>What was the value of the whole property that you lost? - Upon my word, I did not put down the value particularly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fitzpatrick. The value is about eight pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schoen. Are they of the full value you have laid them in the indictment? - They are.</p>
               <p>Court to prosecutrix. Who carried on this proseution? - I cannot afford to do it.</p>
               <p>Who advised you? - My son went to the office to give information; and that was the way it was done.</p>
               <p>Why did not you indict the woman for receiving these things, knowing them to be stolen?</p>

               <p>I was going along this morning that I was taken, and I met a shoemaker, a young man, that had a pair of shoes of mine to mend. Happy was with me; he gave me the two bundles to take to his room, and he said he would give me a pair of shoes he had to mend.</p>
               <p>PRISONER HAPPY's DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>I say the same, that this young man gave me one of the bundles. Knocking at the door of the shoemaker's room, this man came and opened the door, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>The prisoner Happy called one witness to his character.</p>

               <p>Was there among the things you lost a linen sheet, bolster, and a footman? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Were these things ever found again? - Yes, they were found in a woman's apartment; I was there. They were found the Tuesday after my house was broke open, on the Monday evening, the 29th of last month. They were found up one pair of stairs; the footman was found by the fire, and the bolster about half way under the bed. I do not know where the sheet was found.</p>

               <p>On Tuesday, the 30th, I went, in company with the other officers, to the prisoner's apartment, in a one pair of stairs. We found a man's hat, and a number of other things; among which, Mrs. Hilton owned a sheet. We then hearing of other things, took her to the room: she pointed out the footman and the bolster; but the man's hat and sheet were taken in the morning; Shakeshaft has had them, and has them now. While we were there, there was a knocking at the door; Harper and Lucy went down, and took Happy, and in his pocket I found her cloak, and likewise a waistcoat, which was part of her goods; particularly, I saw a bundle brought in by the other officer, which contained a number of things that had been taken from the prosecutrix's house the night before. They were the same two men that were convicted here; they were taken up in the presence of the prisoner. She was particularly asked who lived there; she said nobody but herself; she said the apartments were her own. And whenever we wanted any thing; we took her out of prison, and let her lock her own door. They desired to have some gin; and the two prisoners and she drank together.</p>
               <p>They appeared to know each other? - Very much so. She would give no answer how the things came there.</p>

               <p>Court. Was that when you came into the last house? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Will you venture to say that the prisoner did not advance you money while you was in the house? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Will you swear that, in the state in which you was? - Yes, I will swear, so far that he lent me no money.</p>
               <p>Did he pay no money for you? - I do not know that he did: we had but very little conversation; we had only one pot of beer at the last, I had the other before.</p>
               <p>Was any body else with you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Will you again (young man, be cautious) take upon yourself to say, that, for some purposes in that house, he did not lend you money, or pay money for you? - I swear he did not lend me any.</p>
               <p>What time was it before you quitted the house? - Between eleven and twelve. I cannot say positively.</p>
               <p>How far is Bray's-buildings from Duke-street? - Goes into Duke-street.</p>
               <p>You say you pulled out your watch? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was sober enough to know what you was doing at that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you recollect what you said to him at the time? - I said I could tell, if he would give me time; and he took the watch out of my hand in the mean time.</p>
               <p>Did not you say, as you have laid out some money for me, you shall keep my watch till I see you again? - No.</p>
               <p>This struck you as very uncivil treatment, on his part. Perhaps you called out, stop thief? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>You might have got your watch again? - I might, if I had called out, perhaps; they might have stopped him.</p>
               <p>What became of yourself after that? - I went directly home.</p>
               <p>What time was it when you got home? - Twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>No more than twelve? - No.</p>
               <p>Then as soon as the man had taken your watch, you took no care about it, but went directly home? - Yes.</p>
               <p>When did you see the man afterwards? - On Sunday night; he was at the same house.</p>
               <p>Did you go there to look for him? - I went before, but he was not there: on the Sunday night, the man of the house came to tell me he was there.</p>
               <p>Did not you come by desire of the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not he tell you that the prisoner was there waiting for you? - No.</p>
               <p>Upon your oath? - No.</p>
               <p>Did not you know where to find the prisoner? - No.</p>
               <p>When you came there, did not the prisoner tell you, you had not paid him that money which you ought to have paid him? - No.</p>
               <p>Between the Thursday and the Sunday, you gave yourself no farther trouble about it? - Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do? - I applied<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140090"/>to one of the runners, to take him where they could find him.</p>
               <p>What runner? - Mr. Murray. I forget his name; it is Blacketer.</p>
               <p>Why do you talk about Murray? - I went for him, and could not find him; I never saw either of them before. I was recommended to go to Murray.</p>
               <p>Who recommended you? - A coachman.</p>
               <p>Are you in service now? - No; I left my place last Saturday.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Marybone parish; and the man was brought up between ten and eleven to the watch house by the watchman. I found upon him a couple of keys, and ten shillings in silver; I returned that back again. I asked the prosecutor if he was positive that was the man that robbed him of his watch; he said he was positive; the next morning he went before the magistrate; and while we were at the office, Blacketer searched him again, and found these two keys; we went to his lodging, and found in his box the duplicate wrapped up in a letter, and a seal. I was present.</p>
               <p>- BLACKETER sworn.</p>
               <p>I went to search the prisoner's lodgings; he told me they were his lodgings; I searched the prisoner, and found two keys in his pocket; I asked him what keys they were. I left the prisoner at the office while I went to his lodgings; the prisoner told me that the great key was the key of a yard where his master's carriage used to stand, and the small key was the key of his box; I opened the box with the key that I took from the prisoner; the first thing that I found was a seal; and the prosecutor was there, he said that was his; then I searched all over the box to find the watch, as I found the seal; and I found several letters there, and I felt all the letters; and in one of the letters, I found the duplicate of the watch; I went immediately to the pawnbroker's, and fetched him down to the office.</p>

               <p>I was coming up Ratcliffe-highway about three in the morning, or between two and three, and I saw a woman and a man wrangling one with the other; they went away just before I came to them; and I picked up the bundle; the watchman stopped me; I told him I had some cloaths; I wanted him to look at them; he took me to the watch-house; I have followed the sea ever since I was nine years of age, and never did any thing that was bad.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Beswick. Where had these things been on the Friday night? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Who was the woman that took care of you? - A young woman that is out of place. She was not there of the Friday night; it was a mistake of my husband's. I had nobody with me; nobody was in the house of the Friday night but a young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140092"/>man that lodges with me, my husband and my three children.</p>
               <p>Who was the last up that night? - My husband.</p>
               <p>He says not? - It is merely a mistake.</p>
               <p>Where was the young man that lodged with you? - He was in bed in our house with my child.</p>
               <p>How is the window of that room fastened? - It is a casement with an iron button; the shutters were not fastened; my husband forgot them.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You did not fasten the window that night when you went to bed? - I am sure the window was fast; I forgot the shutter for two nights; I thought there was nothing in the house that any body would come in for. I did not trouble my head about the shutts.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This woman has made her braggs about the neighbourhood, that she would have forty pound for me. I sent for some witnesses, and they promised to come; and the captain of the ship I failed with; but they are not come.</p>

               <p>I searched the prisoner, and found these two handkerchiefs upon him.</p>
               <p>(Produced and deposed to by the paper with-inside, which the witness, Shaw, put in himself.)</p>
               <p>It has no writing upon it.</p>
               <p>How do you know it is the paper? - It is a sheet of our shop paper; I put it in myself.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. How far may the prisoner live from your master? - About thirty yards; he never was employed before; he had not been long in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>I believe it was some time after the pane of glass was broke, before this man came? - The pane was broke; we sent for him immediately, and he came soon after.</p>
               <p>Was not he in liquor? - I did not perceive it.</p>
               <p>How long was he mending this window; did not you observe he mended it very bunglingly? - I did not observe it; he was not long time about it.</p>
               <p>Who first told him to stop at your master's till he was searched, you? - No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Who, then? - Another young man that was in shop.</p>
               <p>Is he here? - No. I took the goods out of the bottom of the window, that they might not be in his way.</p>

               <p>Did you happen to observe where those cloths were? - No.</p>
               <p>These handkerchiefs lay folded up in a square? - Yes.</p>
               <p>A handkerchief that a man dropped out of his pocket might cover this bundle? - It is about six inches square.</p>
               <p>You was present when he was searched? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did he make any difficulty in stopping? - No.</p>
               <p>Where had he left the diamond that he cuts the glass with? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Do not you know that he left a diamond on the window? - It never was seen there.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140093"/>He was, I believe, desired to walk up stairs? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Who walked up stairs with him? - My master.</p>
               <p>I believe your master afterwards left him alone in the room? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Who went for the constable? - He ordered one of the young men to go for the officer. I was in the shop; I did not pay attention; I did not see my master in the shop before the constable came; he might be there.</p>
               <p>Did not this man, in your hearing, say he did not know he had any thing of that sort about him? - He said in the shop, that he did not know he had them. I did not perceive him any worse for liquor.</p>
               <p>Did you attend at all to that circumstance? - He went about his business as well as another man.</p>
               <p>Was not there, at the same time in his pocket, a very dirty cloth, with which he wiped the windows? - I did not see any dirty cloths; there were his gloves, his pocket-handkerchief, and some other things.</p>
               <p>Jury. Can you, on your oath, swear that was the property of your master? - I can, Sir.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to the constable. Did the prisoner make any difficulty to your searching him? - He said he had doubled them up once more than they were before. There were no dirty cloths in his pocket, nor his gloves; there was his key, that he shewed us. His handkerchief was not in that pocket. I did not see the diamond.</p>
               <p>Was the prisoner alone in the dining-room when he came up? - No. There were two women in the room, the nurse, and the mistress, she was not able to get out of the room.</p>
               <p>- INGATE sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a collar and harness-maker in the same yard where the prisoner had the front shop; that is pretty near the prosecutor's.</p>
               <p>Do you know the day he was taken up? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was he in your company that day? - Yes. We had two pints of purl; he would have prevailed upon me to have continued drinking, and to smoak a pipe; but I told him I could not stay; I left him in the publick-house. I know nothing of the man, only one fortnight.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called seven other witnesses, who all gave him a good character.</p>

After he came to me, we were continually missing things; that was the first time, when I turned him away. I had always a suspicion; and in a chest which he had locked up in my house, he had some of my goods; when I was going to turn him away, he wanted to go up stairs for a bundle. I went up with him; there was no bundle; he said it was down in a cellar. He went away; I never suffered him to go into the room any more. The box was locked; I asked him to open this chest, while he went backwards and forwards twenty times. I never could get sight of the things inside; he was indebted to me some money; I was to let him have his tools, and he was to leave those things in the room that were belonging to him, as a security till he paid me my money. I told him, from time to time, that he never should take the chest away till I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140094"/>inside of it; he left about the 6th of September; on the 31st of December, he came and behaved in a very audacious manner, and told me he would make me deliver the property up; he said he wanted a pocket-book out of the chest, concerning some law-suit, and begged very hard to go up to the chest; after my young man had got the key, he made answer, I do not know whether you will not find some spatulas of yours, and some files, which I put either in the chest or behind the chest, when the rooms were washed. The room never was washed since it was a store-room. I said then, that is the parcel we lost about five months ago; we had lost such a parcel, and the prisoner had been employed with others to get up some others in the place of those. I told him also about some other files which were in a store-room I would not let him go into; he said, when the room was washed, he put them in there because they should not be damaged; and the spatulas were not finished, and the files were in papers, when there were hundreds lying about the same room. The files must have been taken out of another room; my young man and me went up stairs. I never touched the key, nor did I unlock it. The prisoner swore d - n his eyes if he did not go up stairs, and pushed by the man; we were looking for the pocket-book, and there we found the spatulas and files; and the prisoner rushed in to the chest; whether we took any thing out, I cannot say; he endeavoured to put down the lid of the the chest; he locked the chest, and went away with the key. The next day I got a warrant from the Lord Mayor, and it was opened in presence of one of his officers; and these nine spatulas and four dozen and a half of files were found in it. I know the spatulas by being the work in my house; the files I know by the private mark.</p>

               <p>Mr. Schoen, prisoner's counsel. How long have you dealt largely in instrument-making? - Ever since the death of Mr. Wrigglesworth.</p>
               <p>Has not this man assisted you very much with custom in that trade? - He certainly has, or I never should have taken him again.</p>
               <p>Was not all of your work done from this man's patterns? - Not all of it; most of it was.</p>
               <p>Had not he the care of the room where the instruments were? - He had not the key wholly; the key hung always up in the counting-house; he had liberty to go and take it up at any time.</p>

               <p>I am apprentice to the prosecutor, almost four years; the prisoner gave me the key of the chest to go up stairs to get a pocketbook for him, wherein he said there was a duplicate for a watch, which he wanted; he then said, he believed there were some spatulas and files, either in the chest, or behind the chest, he was not sure which, which he put in when the room was washed. It is a small room, a store-room, and had been so used before he came this last time; but it had been made use of for a bed-room, after he left it the first time. The prisoner was in the shop while I went up: we did not chuse he should go.</p>
               <p>Did you find the chest locked? - Yes. I unlocked it; my master was present. I found those spatulas and files, and some other articles. The prisoner came up soon after, forced down the lid of the chest, and locked it and took the key. The next morning my master got a search-warrant, and opened the box, and there were found these spatulas and files.</p>

               <p>These spatulas were delivered to me, to be finished by me or the other workmen that were to work under my directions; and the files, some of them, had been used; they were put into the chest, because the maid has frequently moped the room, if<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140095"/>not washed it; nobody can swear to the the files. I had a very great opportunity of taking them long before I left Mr. Thorogood; and the spatulas were not finished.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called eleven witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

On the 14th of November, about twelve at night, I heard a noise in the cart-house, which is about forty yards from the house; I got up to the window, and it ceased; then I went to bed again, and I heard a noise of fowls; I told my brother; we went armed to the cart-house, and Guyatt was on a ladder, with a fowl in his hand; we took him, and afterwards we found Carter concealed by a cart; there were three hens and a cock found within a yard of him, dead; I am sure they were my father's. The next morning, we found seven hens, two cocks, two ducks; and a drake, all dead; and a chissel and a bag lying by the side of the hedge secreted.</p>

               <p>On Wednesday last I lost the things in the indictment. I went to look after a place. I went into a publick-house; and I don't know how I lost them. I did not feel any body's hand in my pocket: I was intoxicated; it was cold, and I went to get a glass of something; it was in <placeName id="t17890114-69-crimeloc360">Shug-lane, at the sign of the Black Horse</placeName>

The weather was very cold; I had got my coat, I believe, under my arm. I am sure I took it into the the house, but whether I dropped it or not, I cannot tell. I fell asleep, and laid my head on the table. I first had some purl and gin; I did not feel any body take any thing from me. It was towards the evening when I went in, not quite dark. I missed my petticoat when I awaked, and the landlord said the prisoner had it.</p>

I went for a constable, and the prisoner pulled nine shillings and a guinea, and a silver thimble out of his pocket; and I wanted to return it to the prosecutrix.

The prisoner at first said this woman was his wife; and she said she did not know him; I sent for a constable, and before he came, the prisoner pulled out of his pocket a guinea, nine shillings, and a silver thimble; the woman was in liquor. I carried the prisoner a quartern of peppermint, and the woman gave him half-a-guinea to get change; I gave it him; he laid it on the table. I cannot say she took it up; she had only one shilling afterwards.</p>

I let a lodging to the prisoner, about twenty-two months ago; she left me about four months ago, She made away with sheets, blankets, bolster and bed; she replaced the bed with a sack of straw, by cutting the bed in half, and drawing the top part of the feathers to the bottom, and the upper part was replaced with a large sack of straw. She was taken up for an assault between four and five months ago, and sent to goal. I went into the room before she went out of my house. She did not go with me; I found the bed as I have represented to you; and the bolster, and blankets, and sheets were gone; when she was in custody, she sent to me, that if I would but forgive her this time, she would replace the feathers. I never found out what she had done with them. She had a room to herself, and those things were articles of furniture. It is five months or six months since I missed the sheets; and she said they were in the wash, and the blankets, she said, were being scoured. About six weeks afterwards, I asked after the sheets, and she said they were lost.</p>
               <p>Do you ever give your lodgers leave to pawn any part of the furniture? - No; I never give my lodgers leave to raise any money on my things.</p>

               <p>The prosecutor keeps a house for unfortunate women; and I have a family of children. The prosecutor and others in the house, have sent me to prison three or four times, through the quarrelling of these women with me. I did make money of this bolster once.</p>

               <p>How came you not to go before the Justice before? - I could not find any body to prove that she had taken the things, till I found these two women.</p>
               <p>Why you cannot prove she took them now? - No farther than what these women say.</p>

               <p>I live on Saltpetre-bank; the prisoner lodged with me. On the day which they accuse him of commiting this matter, he was at my house from four o'clock in the afternoon, till the next morning between ten an eleven. It was the last day of the old year: I am sure of that; for on the next morning, I was going with him on particular business, with a friend of ours. I desired him not to be out of the way, he said he would not.</p>

               <p>I am a lighterman. On the 24th of December, I had loaded some butter at the alley near to Temple-stairs, which is near to Dice-quay. I was watching my butter, and I saw the three prisoners, and some others, lurking about. After my people had brought the butter to the top of the alley, I saw two of the prisoners, and another man, who is not with them, come up the alley with something in their aprons; when they saw me, they were shy, and turned back again, and came down the gateway of Dice-ally. I followed them, and I caught one of them by the skirt of his jacket; he dropped three dishes, and run away. The prisoner, Howard, crept under a cart-tail; and I began to hollow out, and he dropped three dishes. A man followed him, and took him; after that, Benson came with some in his apron, which he dropped, and he was taken.</p>

I went to the coach-stand in Palace Yard, where I knew he belonged to; I knew his coach and person.

The prisoner, and one Murray, was sitting in a box, and had a girl with them; the girl struck me five or six times; she was going to strike at me again, and I shoved her from me. Murray jumped out of the box, and came and held me by the shoulders; and the prisoner came and held me round the middle, and pulled my watch out of my pocket: they both ran out at the door. I thought I felt the watch go; I called out directly: I never got it again; it was a silver watch.</p>
               <p>Court. Was this in the open publick room? - Yes. There were several people saw him, but they do not like to come; I have asked them. The landlord seemed to laugh, and take the prisoner's part, and said it served me right. I am a <rs id="t17890114-76-viclabel398" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

There were twenty people saw me look at my watch not above a minute and a half before; so did the landlord: he will not come. Forrester was sent for, at last, to search the house. I got a warrant, and caught the prisoner in Ratcliffe-highway, between ten and eleven. I told him, and he asked me to have something to drink; then he began d - mning of me, and knocked me down two or three times. I took him to the watch-house, and the girl went along with us; she struck me several times in the watch-house, and spit in my face. The next day I heard Murray was at the same publick-house; I went and asked the landlord for him, and he laughed, and said, it was no business of his.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's council. I believe you was very much in liquor? - Yes, I was a good deal in liquor.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect what time you had been on the ground before the prisoner helped you up? - About three minutes.</p>
               <p>The prisoner did not request you to take him into this alehouse? - No.</p>
               <p>How came you to trust the prisoner with your pocket? - I was so very sick, I could not get at my pocket.</p>
               <p>Do not you recollect desiring this man to take care of what you had valuable about you? - I am sure I did not. I only drank once, a drop of brandy and water, in the house; I do not know how much there was. The person that helped me up with the prisoner, went with me to the watch-house, and saw me home after.</p>

               <p>I was coming from Villars-street, York-buildings, about ten minutes after eleven: As I came down to the bottom of St. Martin's-lane, I saw a person fall, on the other side of the way. Curiosity led me to cross the way; I went close by the prosecutor, and the prisoner asked me to help him up on his feet, which I did. I asked the prisoner if he knew the gentleman; he said he was an old acquaintance of his, and lived in Duke-street, St. James's. The gentleman immediately contradicted it; and the prisoner then said, he had one shilling in his pocket, and would treat the gentleman with a coach home. We staid together some time, helping Mr. Shaw; then the prisoner went to call a coach, and the prosecutor desired me to run after the prisoner for his money. I did not place so much confidence in the prosecutor, being drunk; and I followed the prisoner, to see whether he called a coach or no: he ran past the coach stand; then I called the watchman to my assistance. When we got to the watch-house, the property that Mr. Shaw described was found about the prisoner; four guineas and a half, and a snuff-box, and a part of a lottery ticket, was dropped by the fire-side at the watch-house, within half a yard where the prisoner stood; he stood outside of the fender, and it was inside. I know nothing of the parties.</p>

It was a hare-skin muff, lined with silk; I had no opportunity of seeing the man that did it; it was very sudden indeed; I do not suppose it was a moment; he took it out of my hand, and ran down the court; he was on the left hand.

               <p>I live in Dunning's-alley, Bishopsgate-street. Last Saturday night, between six seven, I heard the cry of stop thief, and I ran out of the door, and faced the prisoner; he was running past my door; I stopped him, and I took the tippet from him; and I was not master enough for him: he chucked the muff into my arms, and I catched it; I kept close to him, running after him till he came into the broad way of Bishopsgate-street, and a young man faced him and caught him in his arms, and we delivered him to the patroles. I was not above half a yard off when he was caught.</p>
               <p>From the time that he chucked the muff to you, was he out of your sight? - No; he was not half a yard from me; I had all but hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. First, he says, he met me; but before my Lord Mayor, he said he pursued me; another thing, he never mentioned a word about tippet before my Lord Mayor; he said that the bundle was chucked at him; next, he is a person of that character; and I have sent for persons to prove, that I am not the first that he has been witness against; and the woman that he lived with has been transported. I hope the court will take it into consideration, that I stand on my life; not only that, but he has bought stolen goods.</p>
               <p>When was the prisoner taken, and in what manner? - He was taken in Bishopsgate-street, just coming on to the kerbstone from Dunning's-alley, at the corner almost of Angel-alley.</p>

            . On Friday, the second of this month, we hired two waggons, one of Mrs. Scott, of Stratford, and one of Mr. Root, of Stratford; to fetch barley out of some vessels that were near Limehouse-bridge; those waggons went twice on that day, each of them; upon their coming home the second turn, I was present at the unloading of them both; we found each of the waggons a sack short of the quantity we supposed they should have brought home; Mrs. Scott's waggon had fifty-nine sacks came home in it, and Mr. Root's waggon thirty-nine.

I stopped and loaded another waggon of Mr. Cooke's afterwards, I put twenty quarters on that. I did not come home with the waggons. When I came home, I helped to unload this waggon of Mrs. Scott's; and when it was emptied, I saw the sacks counted up, and there were only fifty-nine sacks; and I know there was a sack deficient in each waggon.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140108"/>There were thirty-nine in Mr. Root's waggon.

There were three different waggons; one twenty quarters was in Mr. Cooke's waggon; that was the first waggon that was loaded; there were twenty quarters on the second waggon; I do not know whose waggon that was; on the third, I put twenty quarters. I loaded that waggon, and stowed it myself. The last waggon I loaded belonged to Mr. Root. I do not know who loaded the first or second waggon. Higgs was stowing the two first waggons.</p>
               <p>Do you know they were exactly equal quantities in all the waggons? - Mr. Hicks stowed the other two, the last I stowed myself. The last waggon was a distant waggon to those that Hicks loaded. I do not know what became of the barley.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a servant to Mr. George. I know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see him in your master's shop? - No, Sir; as I was putting up the shutters, the prisoner asked me the way to London bridge; I directed him; he stood some time talking with me; and as I was turning to shut up the shutters, I saw the prisoner with the goods under his arm.</p>
               <p>What goods were they? - They were stuff and camblet. I do not know the things; my master put them into the window himself.</p>
               <p>Whereabout were these things? - They were in the window.</p>
               <p>Could he get these things without coming into the shop for them? - No.</p>
               <p>Were the windows broke? - No. He was taken up in less than two minutes.</p>
               <p>With the things upon him? - No.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue him? - Yes. When we came to the top of Hollowell-street, the prisoner struck the other witness right across the thigh; he said, what business had he with him, and he threatened to strike him again; other people came to assist, and he was taken. I did not see the goods after. I do not know what he did with them.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you see the prisoner take the goods? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. What time of night was this? - Between six and seven.</p>
               <p>What month? - The 28th of October.</p>
               <p>It was darkish? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you know the prisoner before? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>And you saw a man pass you with a bundle? - Yes. I knew them to be the things out of our window.</p>
               <p>How was it packed? - He had them under his arm.</p>
               <p>What covering were they in? - There were the wrappers round them that were taken in the shop; the papers were doubled back to shew the goods in the window.</p>
               <p>Were they carried openly? - They were under the prisoner's arm.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to swear that positively? - Yes.</p>
               <p>You was busy shutting up your shop? - Yes. It was in whitish paper.</p>
               <p>Did you see this man apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Which way was he coming? - Up the street.</p>
               <p>Towards your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>So this man, in two minutes after, was coming towards your shop, and in his way to your shop, was apprehended? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was nobody else taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Nobody stopped? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that? Did not you first of all stop any body else?</p>
               <p>Mr. George. I desire to speak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. I desire you will not. I desire Mr. George to go out. This young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140110"/>man is under your influence. Young man, you must speak the whole truth, upon your oath. Was not there somebody else stopped? - Yes; there was a shortish man stopped.</p>
               <p>Why could not you say that when your master was here? - I did not think of it; The two men were both together.</p>
               <p>Was not the other man stopped on the other side of the way now? - They were both together.</p>
               <p>Answer me; was not the other young man stopped on the other side of the way? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>And after some scuffle let go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Was not that in Newcastle-street? - Yes; opposite the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>That man was going from your house, was not he? - They were both returning to our house. They were both arm in arm, and they had two long sticks; and as we were coming up to them, they struck the other witness.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say that these two people, when they were stopped, were arm in arm. Who has told you to say all this? - Nobody told me any thing.</p>
               <p>You say there were two men stopped, arm in arm? - They were arm in arm when they were coming down the street.</p>
               <p>Jury. Speak the truth, and do not be confused.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. Do not fear any body; I do not want to puzzle you. You stopped one man first? - Yes. That man made his escape.</p>
               <p>That man was afterwards taken into custody? - Yes; he was taken into the oil-shop, next to the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>That man was going from your shop? - Yes.</p>
               <p>That man was afterwards let go? - Yes.</p>
               <p>This man, after he was discharged, was stopped coming towards your shop? - They were both taken into custody together. When we first came to Newcastle-street, I saw them both, with two large sticks in their hand; and they struck the other witness across the thigh. He ran into the coffee-house. More people came to our assistance, and they were both taken into the oil-shop together.</p>
               <p>Jury. You say you saw the prisoner with the bundles under his arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Did you pursue the prisoner without losing sight of him? - No. They were both taken up to Bow-street; and by some means the other man went out of the door. He was let go from Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the other man with him at the time he enquired the way to London-bridge? - No, I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Do you mean to say it was this man that enquired his way to London-bridge? - No, it was not this man; it was somebody else.</p>
               <p>Who that man was, you do not know. I understood you to say, that it was the prisoner who enquired his way to London bridge? - No, it was not the prisoner. I have not seen the man that enquired the way to London-bridge since.</p>
               <p>Then you informed a man, and had some conversation with him, and was shutting up your shop; and then you saw the prisoner with a bundle under his arm? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How do you know the bundle contained the things your master spoke of? - I am sure they were my master's goods.</p>
               <p>How far was the man from the shop-door when you saw him with the bundle of goods under his arm? - Not two yards off. I ran into the shop, and I saw the goods were gone; and the other witness came up to me, and asked me if I had lost any thing; I said yes; and we went up to Newcastle-street, and met the prisoner and another man. They had returned again.</p>
               <p>When you came out of the shop, had you lost sight of the man that had the goods? - Yes. I did not see him after he came to the top of Newcastle-street.</p>
               <p>Did you ever see the goods again? - No, they were never found.</p>
               <p>When you saw the man again, did you know that was the man that went into the shop? - Yes. It was the prisoner I saw with the goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140111"/>Had the man that you saw with the bundle, by the shop, a stick? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And you say, both the prisoner and the other man had sticks at the time they were taken? - Yes.</p>
               <p>And they struck the other witness? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Can you, from that very transient view that you had, positively swear that the prisoner is the very same man that you saw with the bundle by the shop-door? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Did you go with the last witness in pursuit of him? - No. There is another witness which I think is proper to be examined before me. On the 28th of November, between six and seven, I had occasion to leave the shop; in the space of two or three minutes, I was informed the shop had been robbed; I instantly came down stairs; the lad that had been in the shop, was gone in pursuit of the person. I was directed to the west end of the street. I pursued, and met one lad turning back. I made up as soon as I could, and saw a man running into Newcastle coffee-house. I suspected him, and laid hold of him; I said, are you one of the villains; no, says he, this is not the man; but pointed to the prisoner, and said, that is the man; I immediately laid hold of the person, and took the men both together into an oil-shop just by; the boy said again, he was clear he was the man; the other person, the witness, could not swear to him, therefore he went off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's counsel. When did the other man go off? - Before he went to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>You did not see the other man go to Bow-street at all? - No; there was only this one man taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>It was a dark night? - It was about seven in the evening. It must be dark.</p>
               <p>Jury. The person that told you the prisoner was the man, is the boy that has been examined? - No; it was the witness that is now coming in.</p>

               <p>As I was coming along Hollowell-street, Mr. George's boy was shutting in the shop. I met the prisoner in the street, walking carelessly along, in a slovenly sort of a manner. I saw two men stand on the contrary side of the way. I went on a little before. I stopped, and heard them asking Mr. George's boy the way somewhere; he said, right down there, that is the way; I turned my head, and saw the prisoner come along with the bundle of things under his arm, and two more, one on each side of him; and they passed me; then I ran back to the boy, and said to him, have not you lost something out of your shop; he said yes; I said follow me; and turning up Newcastle-street, I met the prisoner, and the other that was on the left side of him, turning back again.</p>
               <p>Had the prisoner a bundle at that time? - No, he had not.</p>
               <p>Are you sure the prisoner is the man? - I am sure he is the man that I saw in the street before he had the bundle; I am sure he is the man that passed me with the bundle under his arm. The little man I saw with them before, had left them; as I went past them, one of them struck me very sharp on the thigh; they said not a word; I gave them the pavement. I could not then see which it was. I went to the end of the street, and looked all the three ways; one went to Clare-market, and the other went to Butcher-row, the other to Drury-lane.

               <p>Did the prisoner follow you? - The prisoner followed me up to the door; and Mr. George's man came up, and said, that is the man that had your things; what he has done with them, I cannot tell; but he is the man that had them when he came by me.</p>

               <p>And you had not many minutes to observe him? - No, not very many minutes, only the time he was passing me; but I looked very earnest at him before he had the things; and when he had the things, he was on the same side of the way, and two more; he had a round hat on, and his hair was in a twist.</p>

               <p>What was said to these two men coming along? - Not a word. They struck me as I came past them. They were walking towards me; there was not a word of any side after the blow. I went to the top of the street.</p>

               <p>Were the feather-bed, bolster, sheets, and flat iron let with the lodging? - They were part of the furniture.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140113"/>What have you to say against her? - She was not there above four days before she was gone with my things without notice; when she had been gone about a week, I enquired after her. I never had the key. I got the door open by another key, in a weeks time; and I missed the bed and the bolster; the bolster was not a feather bolster, but the bed was a feather bed. I missed a flat iron and a sheet; the things I missed, were a part of the things I let to her. I never got them again. I found her about twelve days after she went away. She was going into a tallow-chandler's, for a candle, and I laid hold of her. I think it was about a week or ten days after I opened the room.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I had not a room of you for almost three months, and paid you honestly and truly; and when I went away I met you, being very much in liquor?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. Lack-a-day, how can you say so!</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I took a pair of sheets off the bed, the coverlid, the candlestick, and all the things, and put them to a neighbour's, next door; she had her key the next morning, and was very well contented, till she said I had robbed her of a brass candlestick, and she would trouble me; I heard of it, and came; I came with my husband to her, and told her where I was; at last she pulled the candlestick out of her pocket. That is the first room I had of her; now, Sir, I never took any room of her; it was a little bit of a place she gave me leave to lay in at night. I asked her what she charged. I treated her with a quartern of liquor. I gave the key to the granddaughter. The next evening, I went to her own daughter for a halfpenny candle. It is all spite, because we owe her a trifle of money.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. Is the prisoner a married woman? - I do not know any such thing.</p>
               <p>Did she and a man, by whose name she went, lodge together in any room? - Yes, she lived with a man; but she never called him her husband.</p>
               <p>How long ago was that? - About two months. She owed me twelve shillings. She told me she belonged to the Hall; I went down and enquired, and found she did; that she had so much a quarter from it; so I let her into the other room, hoping she would pay me.</p>

               <p>I am a granddaughter to the prosecutrix. I was thirteen, the 12th of September. I know the prisoner; she lodged at my grandmother's house twice; the first time, I believe, it was six weeks or a month.</p>
               <p>Was there any man lived with her then? - I do not know; but she said there was a shoemaker lived with her then; but that was not her husband. She came again to lodge in about six weeks or a month; she had a room of my grandmother; a ready furnished room. She staid about two days. She came the 15th of October for the key; and on the 16th, she came for a flat iron; about noon; and about seven, she came for a sheet; and said, she must have it; I said I had not got it; she said, she had met my grandmother, and she said, it hung by the fire; I said, it did not: she took the candle off the table, and stole this apron from off the line, which was in our kitchen, just close by the chimney; that was the room where I was. I took the apron from underneath her. She sat herself down in a chair, and said she would not stir till my grandmother came home. I looked, and saw the apron hanging either from under her gown or her petticoat; I said you have something of my grandmother's; and I pulled the apron from underneath her; and another witness came down and saw it: she called me a good-for-nothing, dirty slut; and said, if she had got it, she had got it; I pulled it from underneath her covering; there was my grandmother's name on it; in pulling that apron down, this apron that I have on, fell down with it; and a cinder fell down on it, and burnt it. I saw her no more till she was taken up. A woman came down, and heard a great noise,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140114"/>and saw me pulling it from underneath her; and she called her a good-for-nothing woman, and shoved her out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I come at ten at night, and ask for the key? - I was in bed. It was a girl in the house heard her; I did not hear her.</p>
               <p>Court. Do you know whether any body that was in the house did hear her? - Yes; there was a girl, not near so big as me, said she did hear her; and she answered her, and said we were gone to bed.</p>
               <p>How soon afterwards did your grandmother miss the things? - I believe she went up on the Sunday, and called up to Mrs. Banks.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure that the apron did not lay on the chair, and that therefore she was sitting upon it? - No. This apron and another were hanging upon the line. I had been ironing.</p>
               <p>Might it not drop off the line? - No, it did not; for in taking this off, it pulled this down, and was burnt; I called in a witness, and shewed it her.</p>

               <p>I live in the house. I saw the things in the prisoner's possession. She came to lodge in the house, in a one pair of stairs back room. There were two beds in that room. She came the 15th of October; and I never saw her after the 16th. I heard, on the 17th, in the morning, on the stairs, about a quarter past six; I never saw her after.</p>
               <p>Did you know she was gone to any other lodging? - No.</p>
               <p>Do you know whether she had paid, and taken her leave? - It was but two days. She did not pay, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, do you remember opening the room? - Yes; that was the Tuesday following. My landlady came on the Sunday, she does not live in the house; and said she believed the woman laid there. I said I had not seen her since the 16th of the month; she told me concerning the apron; and the Thursday after, which, I believe, was the 25th. She came to me, and said she was afraid she had lost something; her arm was lame. She asked me to open the door with a key, which she had on a bunch; the door was locked; and when we opened the door, one bed was there, but not the other; one was gone. I do not know that the things were ever found again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She mentioned nothing of the apron before the Justice; the apron hung on the chair. I never touched it; but sitting down on the chair, the skirt of my gown rubbed it down.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. I never had the key from that time to this. I missed my apron that night. There was a little girl, ten years old, who said she heard the prisoner call. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to prisoner. Where did you go to from this woman's? - To one Mr. Berry's. They are not here now. I was ill of the fever last sessions. I had witnesses then.</p>

I went there on Saturday, the 10th of January, between seven and eight to feed the dogs; when I came to the door, I knocked two or three times; nobody answered.

I suspected something was wrong. I looked up and down the stable. He went up to give the horses hay, and I examined the stable; and before one of the horses, I saw some straw heaped up; I saw what it was, it was a truss of hay, covered with some straw. I told my master, and went down to the stable again; he was not there, nor at the publick-house; I told my master; he desired me to go down a second time; he was not there. About eleven, I found him in the publick-house; I told him his master wanted him; he refused to come with me. My master sent another servant, and he came. My master asked him for the key of the stable; he said it was at the publick-house; I went there, and they said it was not there. I came down again, and could not make them hear me; upon his hearing me say that the key was not there, he gave the key to my master; and my master gave me the key; and he went down to the stable with me; there we found

               <p>What is Davis? - I cannot say. I did not know him before I saw him sometimes thereabouts. I had seen him in the stables with Battie before. Then Davis said, there was this Martin there, and a boy; we went down again, and the door was bolted. I was obliged to go to get a ladder, and break the window; and we found this Martin and the boy there. The boy's name is

            . We found the boy in a manger, and Martin was standing still. We carried them up to the house. The truss of hay was gone. I have no knowledge of Davis particularly, further than seeing him at the stable, and at the publick-house with Battie.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys, prisoner's counsel. How long have you lived with Mr. Whitehead? - I cannot remember the time rightly; about four or five months since I came about his house first.</p>
               <p>You said you knew Davis by sight? - Yes. I had seen him about a fortnight or three weeks. I have met with him at the publick-house, and spoke to the man. I wished him no ill.</p>
               <p>I believe, to your knowledge, before this time, Davis had slept in these stables some nights? - I knew he had slept there: Battie had slept there too.</p>
               <p>You had not acquainted Mr. Whitehead of that? - No.</p>
               <p>I suppose that was not altogether correct? - No; but as he was a poor honest man.</p>
               <p>Did you tell Battie there would be no harm if he would let Davis sleep there? - I never did. He never asked my advice concerning it.</p>
               <p>Was not Davis in the stable at the time you knocked at the door, when Battie said he was afraid it was his master? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you see Davis in the stable the first time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Your master's stock of hay was low? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Is not it customary for coachmen and gentlemen's servants to borrow hay of each other? - Yes.</p>
               <p>How soon this truss of hay came in you do not know? - No.</p>
               <p>- WHITEHEAD sworn.</p>
               <p>My house is in Soho square; my stables behind Falconberg-court. The prisoner, Battie, was my groom; he had the care of my horses. The last witness had the care of my pointers and spaniels. On Saturday, evening, the 10th of January, Battie was brought to me between eleven and twelve; he appeared to me to be a little in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140116"/>liquor; I asked him for the key of the stable.</p>
               <p>Court. Battie being then a little in liquor, I think we cannot hear any thing but facts; we cannot make evidence of what he said; the objection to the confession of a man in liquor, being stronger than one obtained by promises and threats, and for the same reason, that it may not be true? - In consequence of what he said, I went to the stable; he gave the key, having first said he left it at the publick-house. The last witness is mistaken; he told me there was Davis in the stable, who had the key with him in the stable. After my man had been sent to the publick-house, I went with the watchman, and one or two more; we called out in a feigned voice, Jem, open the door; after which the door was gently opened on the inside; we found Davis there, and brought him to my house; when I got him home, I asked him what business he had there; he then said, there were two others in the stable; that one of them was his own son, and begged I would not alarm or hurt the boy, or words to that effect. I got another watchman; and when we got to the stable the second time, we found the door fast, as we imagined in the inside; we called up our next neighbour to borrow a ladder; the watchman, and the other servant broke a pane, and got into the stable; there we found Martin, and young Davis; they were taken to the watch-house; the prisoner, Davis, to all appearance, was perfectly sober.</p>
               <p>Did you make use of any promises or threats, to induce him to tell you why he came into the stable? - I did not to any one.</p>
               <p>Did Davis say any thing why he came to that stable? - He made excuses for having come there to assist my men to attend the horses. He made no confession; he denied it. I never suspected Battie of dishonesty before he was found out. I never looked for the hay. I always give my servant a caution never to suffer any person to come into the stables.</p>

            ? - I know Murdock; I remember his coming to the stable to feed the dogs: he could not; get in, at first. I was in the stable; and Charles said, I think that is my master coming. Charles was there, and my father: Martin was not there; he was at the alehouse. Charles said to me, get under the manger. Murdock saw me, when we opened the door.</p>
               <p>Do you know any thing of a truss of hay that was in the stable when he came to feed the dogs? - There was some hay in the hay-loft; but there was none under the straw, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Then that was the day before you was taken up, that the hay was taken? - Yes.</p>

               <p>When did he take any corn out? - He took it out (I forget what night it was, now) when Charles sold the truss of hay. My father was there, but Martin was in the publick-house. My father said, stay in the publick-house, do not come in, because my master will turn you away.</p>
               <p>Who took the money? - Charles took the money.</p>
               <p>What was done with the money afterwards? - I do not know; we went in, and had some beer together.</p>
               <p>Did he give any part of the money to any body else? - He gave no money to any body else; he gave my father some beer.</p>

               <p>Has not Mr. Taylor, of the Three Tuns, charged you with stealing a pair of shoes? - He said I had done it, but I never did.</p>
               <p>Now, Mr. Whitfield, did not he say you had stolen a piece of iron of his, and a fowl? - He did say that I stole a fowl in his stable; but I did not.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect a little boy, with an ass, who accused you of stealing his ass, too? - I asked him to come along with me, and I would shew him some buildings: he came after me; and when I saw the workman belonging to the fields, I ran away.</p>

               <p>I knew Davis eight or nine years; he always followed the occupation of a rat-catcher; I never heard any thing against him. His son came to my house last Wednesday evening. I was going to bed. He told me he was destitute of a lodging, and begged me to let him abide at my house till the morning; I told him he might sit by the fire. In the morning, I gave him some breakfast, and dinner; he staid the whole day. He said his father was in trouble; I asked him what for; he said on suspicion of stealing some hay and corn out of a gentleman's stables in Soho Square, and that he was taken up too. He said, the gentleman took me to his house, and locked me up in a room, and told me I should be hanged, if I did not tell concerning what became of the day and his corn; says he, I did not know what became of it, but they told me it was sold to a <rs id="t17890114-82-viclabel442" type="occupation">coachman</rs>, in St. Giles's, one Mr. Pierrepont. I was afraid of keeping him in my place, so I sent him to my brother; and a gentleman took him to Mr. Whitehead. I remember the boy when he was in his mother's arms; I do not look upon him to be more than ten or eleven, though he told me, when he was going to the magistrate, the gentleman told him to say he was fourteen.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you knew him? - Ten or eleven years.</p>
               <p>Did you know him above eight years? - Yes; he was a little child in petticoats. I first knew him on Saffron-hill; I remember him about eight years.</p>
               <p>He was two or three when you first knew him? - He might be.</p>
               <p>Do you recollect when you first knew him? - It was since the time of the riots<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="178901140119"/>in L; it might be two or three years since.</p>
               <p>How many years is it since the riots? - About eight or nine years.</p>
               <p>Jury to M'Millan. What way is the hay brought down to the horses in general? - It is put down from the loft to the rack.</p>
               <p>Not put down in trusses? - No.</p>
               <p>Whether, when you looked about the stable, you found the boy concealed? - No, I did not.</p>
