I missed twelve fowls and three ducks. On the morning of the 23d I found two of my fowls, dead, at Norris's, at Hoxton - I knew them directly; White had them: I have no doubt of their being mine. One was an old blue and white hen; the other a very dark cock. I am very positive of them.</p>

On the 22d of March, about five o'clock in the morning, I came to my master's premises, to work, and saw Hill laying on some straw in the cart-shed - he told me he had been there since three o'clock, as his mother had locked him out; I told him to be off about his business: I then went and milked my cows, and in about an hour I went to put up the straw which he had pulled down, where he had been laying, and found two fowls - I carried them into the stable, to the carters, and while we were looking at them the prisoner came back, and said,</p>
               <p>"Those two fowls belong to me;" he saw them in my hand: I gave them into his hand; he said,</p>
               <p>"No, you may keep them, for I have twelve or fourteen more in my mother's privy." I took them into my master's house, and about ten o'clock at night I heard of this robbery - Sergeant came to me next morning, and owned them; the hen was dark, and the other a very light one; he left them with me to see if I could find the prisoner - I had known him for six months; he was not found for two months: I went to his mother's about an hour after he went away - I got over a wall, and saw several fowls and three ducks in his mother's privy - there might be twelve or thirteen; I do not know what became of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. When you were first asked where you got them, what did you say? A. That I bought them of a young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you had had them in your possession twelve months, and bought them of a little woman in a black gown? A. No; I said I was not out for a twelve-month till that day, which made me know the day.</p>

            . I lodge in the same house as the prisoner - she lived with a man named Tottenham. On Whitsunday, between six and seven o'clock, Tottenham came home, and struck her, and hurt her very much - she took to her bed, and was a bed on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and went to the hospital on Friday; she could not go up and down stairs without help; she could not go out without my knowledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What became of the man who beat her? A. He went out - he came home that evening, and went to bed with her, and remained at home. I was at home when she was apprehended; I cannot say whether it was on Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the course of the same week in which he beat her? A. Yes, I am sure of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there had not been another Sunday? A. No, I am quite sure of that; she was only a quarter of an hour gone to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. If she was taken before another Sunday came round, and went to the hospital on Friday, she must have been taken on Saturday? A. I rather suppose it was Saturday; I am sure another Sunday had not come. I believe Tottenham has lived with her for twelve years - he is a horse-dealer, buying and selling them for gentlemen. I saw him this morning at the house - he still lives there.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. At what time did you come home on Sunday? A. About four o'clock in the afternoon. I found her in bed; Tottenham came in and slept there that night - he is a horse-dealer at Smithfield, I believe; he left the house when she was taken up, and has not been near the house since - I live there now. She was taken up on the Tuesday fortnight after the Whitsunday, as well as I can recollect. Two Sundays had passed before she was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been out of doors before she was taken up? A. She went to the hospital on Friday; she got rather worse after that, and did not go out again till she was taken. I saw Tottenham an hour ago.</p>

            . I am a journeyman tailor, and husband of the last witness. The prisoner and Tottenham co-habited together, on the same floor as I live. On the evening of Monday, the 22d of May, I was in my room, which is divided from their's by a wainscoat - my wife had gone down stairs; something passed between them about liquor: I heard her give him a blow, and he knocked her down, and kicked her; she came to me in about ten minutes, and said he had nearly killed her - that he was gone out. I work at home. Tottenham was absent two days; she was in bed, or sitting in my room, and did not go down stairs till Thursday, when my wife helped her down; she went to the hospital on Friday: she returned, and I told my wife I thought she would never get over it. When she was taken she came into my room, and said,</p>
               <p>"They have taken me for Beal's robbery."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long did Tottenham absent himself? A. Two days, but he slept there every night.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she able to go out after Friday? A. She was in and out as well as she was able. I think she was taken up on the Tuesday fortnight. Tottenham is now outside the Court.</p>

On the 28th of May I went to bed about eleven o'clock; I got up about eight o'clock in the morning, and found the house fastened up as I had left it - this property was gone. I had heard the latch of the back door fall down just before we went to bed; it had been left ajar, as the latch sticks; I went down stairs, and heard footsteps crossing the yard; the door was just put too. I then took a sheet in, which hung in the yard - I bolted the door, and it was still bolted in the morning, but I missed the same sheet that I had brought in from the yard. There was a square of glass broken in the kitchen before - a hand could be put through that, and the hasp unfastened, but if it had been opened it was fastened again. On Monday evening, the 30th, I was sent for, and found the prisoner Thompson talking to a boy named Rayment; I charged Thompson with this robbery, and said if he would give me my things I would not hurt him. Rayment took me to Summers's house, in Peel-ally, Shadwell; I found the shirt on Summers's back, and the sheet and stockings in his house; the stockings were rolled up in a cap belonging to a boy, called the Grecian, and put under Summers's bed; my sheet was cut in several pieces - I knew it by my sewing upon it; it was a coarse brown one; it was cut up to be made into two pairs of trowsers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Summers say? A. Thompson went there with me, and told Summers he wanted those things that the Grecian had brought on the Saturday night; Summers asked where the Grecian was; he said he did not know: Summers said,</p>
               <p>"What does this woman want?" I said I wanted my things; he said to the lad,</p>
               <p>"Go out of the way a bit, and I will settle it with the woman; I said,</p>
               <p>"I wont go till I have got my things; where are they? have you pawned or sold them?" he told the boy to go<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300005"/>out of the way again; he said I would not let him: Thompson then said,</p>
               <p>"I believe, if I must speak the truth, he has the shirt now on;" I then looked, and said it was the shirt; he took it off, and gave it to Bolton, the headborough. Rayment turned the bed up, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here are the stockings in the Grecian's cap." I had seen Thompson and the Grecian lurking about my house till half-past ten o'clock that night; and as soon as my husband came up stairs I heard the latch fall.</p>

On Sunday, the 15th of May, I and my sister went out for the day, leaving nobody at home; I made the door fast, tried it, and took the key with me; this property was then perfectly safe. We returned about ten o'clock at night, and found the gate of the fore court open; I had locked it - the lock was not injured: I found the house apparently as I had left it; the street door was locked, but I found a difficulty in unlocking it. On entering the house I missed four silver spoons from the front parlour, and on examination we missed the other articles, and next morning, about twelve o'clock, I found them at Worship-street, in possession of Grafton, the officer.</p>

We returned at ten, and found the fore-court gate open; I missed all these things, which were safe when I went out; (examining the property) here is a silk dress of mine - it was made for me; I had worn it twice; I put this string to it. Here is another dress of mine - each of them are worth 1 l. Here are four new table-cloths and a looking-glass, of my brother's.</p>

            . I am a shoe-maker, and live in Brunswick-place, Stoke Newington. On Sunday, the 15th of May, I was returning from a place of Worship, and saw the prisoner standing opposite to Mr. Truman's gate (as I now know it to be) - he was apparently reading a paper; he stood there till I came up to him, and just as I got up to the gate I saw another person come out of Truman's door, with a bundle, and shut it - he spoke to the prisoner as he passed, and left him behind; the prisoner went on the other side of the way; I suspected something, it being Sunday; I did not know that I had a right to interfere, but I took particular notice of their dress and manner, and let them go away. I saw the prisoner in custody on the Wednesday following, and am fully persuaded that he is the person - I have not the least doubt of it: he was not dressed exactly the same as before: he had a black coat on at Worship-street, but I knew him immediately. I took particular notice of him, being apparently reading, and yet looking about him. He followed the other man when he had got about thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did there appear any acquaintance between them? A. There was no particular friendship. but a short sentence passed between them - I cannot tell what the paper was about.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Islington. On Sunday, the 15th of May, I was in Lower-road, Islington, about a mile and a half from the prosecutors', and saw the prisoner and another man on the road - the prisoner was carrying a bundle containing the property produced, and the other man a hat tied up in a handkerchief. I went up and asked the prisoner where he got the bundle; he threw it down, and ran off; I picked it up, pursued, and secured him nearly a quarter of a mile off; his companion escaped. I was informed the other man had gone into the Gun, public-house, where I found this hat, tied in a handkerchief; I have kept the articles ever since: the spoons have not been found. I have a blue bag, two handkerchiefs, a screw-driver, and several skeleton keys, which were all found on the prisoner's person - two of the keys open Truman's gate and street door.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written Defence, stating that he was returning from Newington between twelve and one o'clock, and met a young man carrying three bundles, who asked where he was going - he replied to Islington, and the man then asked him to carry two of them to the Gun, public-house, and on his being stopped this man ran away, which rose his suspicions, and he threw the bundle down, and ran off - that the man had told him he was going to the Gun, where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On Saturday, the 16th of February, 1822, at eight o'clock in the evening, I left the building, and went in doors to supper, having locked the door. I returned in about an hour and twenty minutes, and found a square of glass broken from the front window, and the screw which held the sashes together taken out; the window had been opened: I found my box forced open, and a great coat, two coatees, and an eye-glass taken - four calico shirts and other things were gone, but I did not miss them for six months, as I only wear them in the summer. I found a garden ladder against the wall; they had escaped out at a back door, which had marks of a chisel on it. On the Monday following Clarkson produced my things to me.</p>

            . I am private watchman to Sir William Curtis. In February, 1822, I belonged to the Police. I was going on duty with my brother officer, on the 18th, and in consequence of information from the prisoner's brother, I watched a house in East Barnet-lane, about a mile and a half from the prosecutrix's, and about six or seven o'clock in the morning I saw three men and two women come out of the house, and go up the lane together; we stopped them, and asked what they had in their bundles; the prisoner had a bundle, and said it was working clothes - we took them off his back, and he immediately ran away; the other two were secured: one of them had a pump. I knew the prisoner before - he is a labourer, lived in East Barnet-lane, and worked in brick-fields. Harland claimed the bundles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You met five persons in company? A. Yes; they did not see us till they came up to us: all three dropped their bundles, and the prisoner ran off; I saw his face for full two minutes, and saw him before they came up.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Has he been at home since? A. Not that I have heard - I have not inquired for him. I swear positively to him - he had a short jacket and breeches on.

Davis pushed me, and knocked my hat off, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300007"/>in running to save my hat she endeavoured to push me down on the ground, but I saved myself by a bar before a window. Ferris came up, using very bad expressions - she said,</p>
               <p>"So help me God, you must satisfy the woman" - they all three pinioned my arms down, and broke two buttons of my waistcoat; Davis took my money out of my breeches pocket - there were eight sovereigns and four half-sovereigns wrapped up in a 5 l. and a 30 l. Bank note, taken from my right hand pocket; I had a purse containing 8 s. 9 d., and an old subpoena in my other pocket, which Ferris took out. I had received the money for my employers, at Masterman's bank that day, and was going home. I am sure these are the women - they were taken on the Monday following. I have not recovered a farthing. I recollected having seen Davis about Whitechapel before; it was quite light: I am sure they are the women. I was quite sober. They ran round different courts, and I lost them. I immediately went to Lambeth-street-Office, and gave information. I saw them in custody on the Monday, and am positive of them.</p>

No. The money was safe when I was in Crispin-street, two streets from where I met them, and I saw them take it out; I saw it in their hands: it was a very fine evening. I was not confused. I swear to them positively; I cannot be mistaken. I called Stop thief! but not a soul would come to my assistance.</p>

I was in London in June, and lodged at the Mitre Inn, Mitre-street, near Duke-street, Aldgate. On Monday, the 6th of June, at rather more than half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I went through <placeName id="t18250630-8-crimeloc44">Whitechapel</placeName>

I sat on the bed - she sat near me, and proposed that I should give her money; I said,</p>
               <p>"My dear young woman, you have brought me into such a place as I was never in before - I don't wish to stop, let me go;" she said she must have half-a-crown; I said, No, I would give her a shilling to let me go. She said she was not well herself, and not in a proper way, and would call up another woman; I said No: she opened the door, and called to the other prisoner by the name of Selly; she came: I was sitting on the bed - I had pulled off my top coat, and put it on the table. Groves came in in a very impudent way, and sat on my knee, and would not let me go; I said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake let me go - I will give you something:" my small clothes were unbuttoned when she came in; I said I did not wish to have her at all, and she must let me go; she said I had no money; I knocked against my pocket, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have a little copper;" she said,</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you have only a few halfpence." I was obliged to take out my purse, containing this money, to give her a shilling to get rid of her; I pulled out 2 s., but she would not take it; I put it back into my purse, and returned it to my pocket; and in less than two minutes she (Groves) put her hand into my pocket, and drew my purse out - I felt her do it: she gave me a blow across my stomach, and ran out across the other side of the way; Williams had run out just before, and said to her,</p>
               <p>"I leave the concern to you." Groves gave me a blow, and ran across the way; I caught up my top coat, and ran after her, but she was gone. When I came into the street a parcel of women pulled me about, one saying she was gone one way, and another the other; they both got off. A man shewed me the way to Whitechapel-office, where I saw Lea and Foster, and two days after I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300008"/>them in custody - I am quite sure they are the women who were in the room with me, and who I have spoken of. I have found neither purse nor money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where did you get all this money? A. From customers who I have sold goods to. I had twenty-six sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, a half-crown, four shillings, and a purse. I had been at the Mitre in the early part of the day, and was sober - I never drink. I was afraid to stop from the appearance of the place. I did not know when I met her that she would take me to such a low room; I looked into my purse while I was in the room; I took it out to give her a shilling; I had counted the money and put it into my purse a moment before I left home - I was going to a shopkeeper to buy goods.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner used no violence to you when she sat on your knee? A. She did not use me roughly; she pulled the money gently from my pocket; I felt it, and caught hold of her hand, but she got off with it; the money was not taken quietly from me, for I caught hold of her hand, and she forced it out.</p>
               <p>Q. From the short time you saw Groves may you not be mistaken in her person? A. I am sure I am not; it was near four o'clock when I got home after the robbery; I saw the clock in Whitechapel: I cannot say how long Groves was in the room - it lasted ten or twelve minutes before she came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that she went into the room, and out of it in a moment? A. Williams called her up, and spoke to her in some strange language, and then said,</p>
               <p>"I leave the concern to you," and left the room, and shoved the door together; it was flash language. I heard her say as she shut the door,</p>
               <p>"I shall keep the coat for payment of the room."</p>

               <p>WILLIAMS'S Defence. Foster and Lea can prove that I was acquitted before the Magistrate.* I was going on an errand in Whitechapel - he followed me home, and asked if he should come after me; I said very well, and he followed me up stairs, and asked what he was to give me; I said 2 s. 6 d. - he said he was poor, and offered me 1 s.; I differed with him, and at last said,</p>
               <p>"Well, give me the shilling;" he said he would not give it to me first: I said I would not stop with him unless he gave me the money first; he began to pull me about, and would not let me go; I said I would not stop with him, and finding I could not get away I said I was unwell, but he could have another young woman. I left, and never saw his money or purse. He told quite a different tale at the office.</p>
               <p>* The prisoner William had surrendered in Court to take her trial.</p>
               <p>JURY to SAMUEL COHEN. Q. Was Williams the first person who sat on your knee? A. No; she sat on my side, and the other on my knee. Williams unbuttoned my small-clothes.</p>

No; Mrs. Clare lives there and takes care of the premises for me - she pays me rent for the upper part of the house - I pay the rent and taxes of the whole house - I pay her no salary - she merely attends to my business if I am out. The prisoner had left my service a few days before - his father is now in my employ, and has given me information to get part of the property back.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whose dwelling-house is it? A. Mrs. Clare pays me rent - we both enter at the same door.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH CLARE. I rent part of this house of Mr. Wilby at 30 l. a-year; he occupies the shop and counting house; the street door leads into the shop. On the 9th of May I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock; I was not disturbed in the night; about half-past six o'clock in the morning my servant called me up - I found Mr. Wilby's counting-house and shop strewed all over with goods - the bolts and bars were undone, but there was no appearance of force; the persons must have got in at a small opening leading to the cellar; it was just wide enough for a person to get in - he must then force the cellar door, which fastens with a small button - I cannot say whether it was buttoned or not - it opens into the passage - the counting-house was not locked - two drawers in the counting-house were broken open - I lost some spoons from the kitchen, which is on the same floor as the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you pay a less rent in consideration of your minding the shop occasionally? A. No; I merely assist as his family are friends of mine; the shop and work-shop was for his exclusive use - the cellar door could be easily opened, as the top part was quite loose; I found a chisel on Mr. Wilby's desk; which did not belong to him.</p>

I received two 10 l. notes, Nos. 4131 and 4132, dated the 12th of March, 1825, from Mr. Hankin; I put them into my dressing-case, which I locked, and put into a drawer, which I also locked; I saw them safe at half-past two o'clock on the 8th of April, and left my chambers about three, leaving nobody there. I reside at the chambers - they have an outer door, which I double locked: I returned at six that evening, found all the drawers broken open, and the property stated in the indictment gone - the value, including the notes, is between 70 l. and 80 l. I found a crow bar in the chambers; the door-lock had not been forced - the locks of the drawers had been wrenched off, and the marks corresponded with the crow bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK, Q. Are yours double chambers? A. No, but a Mr. Nixon also lives in them and sleeps there; I am the tenant - he is to pay me rent - he has a key; there are only two keys: I would not have sworn to the numbers of the notes had I not since made inquiry.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had Mr. Nixon any door that he could shut against you? A. No.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that memorandum made by yourself? A. I made it after I received information of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300010"/>robbery, which was two or three days after I had paid him the notes.</p>

            . I am a tailor, and live in George-street, Shoreditch. I remember a person coming to my house to buy a pair of trowsers, on the Saturday in Easter week - the prisoner is that person: he asked for two pair of trowsers - I gave him some to look at - another man came in - they said</p>
               <p>"Good morning," to each other - nothing else passed between them; the prisoner bought some trowsers and paid me a 10 l. note, which I got changed at Perry's, the George public-house; the other man bought a pair of breeches which were in pledge - he gave me another 10 l. note, which I got changed at the pawnbroker's; the name of Nichol, No. 19, Provot street," was written on the back of it, during the time I went into the back room, but which of them wrote it I cannot say: I cannot read myself, but my wife, who was in the shop, read that to me, but not in the prisoner's presence - I cannot identify it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you see the prisoner in custody? A. It might be five or six weeks after Vann, and another officer, came and took me to the office in a coach, not as a prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When Vann pointed the prisoner out to you did you not say</p>
               <p>"So help me God that is not the man?" A. I said it was not the man: I believe I said I was sure he was not the man - I said nothing to give strength to that declaration.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Vann order you to be locked up till you said he was the man? A. Yes; when I was locked up I said I thought he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath were you not taken up for the robbery and examined, a fortnight before the prisoner was in custody? A. No; I was taken to the office a week or ten days after the robbery: I have seen two men since the prisoner was taken, who appeared to me a good deal like the men, and directly they saw me they ran away: I told a friend of it - I do not know his name.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If you knew him, you knew his name? A. It was an attorney who came to me, Mr. Price - I could not recollect his name before; I think the prisoner is older than the man was.</p>

Patrick was in a court, but I do not know what he was doing; I did not push against him, nor did he complain that I had done so; I did not take out my book, and say I was an officer, and that was my charge book, and I would make an entry of their having attempted to rob me, and pull them up the next day. I told them I would give them in charge; I might say it was my inventory book: they did not take me by the collar for the purpose of giving me in charge, for assaulting them; it was I who first called Watch! I charged them with the assault, but not with an attempt to rob. I was not drunk. I swear I did not assault either of them till they took hold of my collar.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 20th of April, about one o'clock in the morning. I was going my rounds, and heard the call of Watch! I went to the spot with Cox, and found the prisoners in contact with the prosecutor; Patrick had his hand on him, and the prosecutor's hat was in the gutter; he said,</p>
               <p>"Watchmen, take these two men into custody;" we took them to the watch-house; they were not quite sober: when they got there they said that Winstandly had assaulted them, but they did not say how - he rebutted the charge.</p>
               <p>PATRICK'S Defence. We had been to a friend's, to see the process of pipe making - it was near one o'clock before we left there: my friend stopped in Grub-street; I was going on, and passed the prosecutor; he said,</p>
               <p>"Who are you? and what are you?" I replied,</p>
               <p>"Who are you" - I passed on, and when I got on the opposite side of the way, he followed, and called me a vagabond and scoundrel; I asked what he meant - he said he meant what he said, and said,</p>
               <p>"Here is my charge book," and struck me with it in the month; he made my lip bleed: my friend then came up, and pushed him from me; the watchmen were called, and they came up; Cox, the watchman, said,</p>
               <p>"I will take that gentleman's charge in preference to your's." There were two gentlemen who saw the transaction, and I asked them to go to the watch-house, but the constable of the night would not admit them, and took the charge against us. I said the prosecutor was drunk - the watch-house-keeper said it was no matter whether he was drunk or sober, he had given the charge, and he must take it; we had then no recourse but to publish handbills; in consequence of which those gentlemen came forward to take our parts.</p>

               <p>"What do you mean by that?" at which time both parties called for the watch; there was nothing then said about any attempt to rob him: they were taken to the watch-house; I and another witness went there, but were refused admittance. The prisoners were strangers to me.</p>

               <p>HENRY TROWSE STEVENSON. On Friday, the 13th of May, I saw the prisoner (whom I had known before), at the Roe Buck, public-house, in Holborn - we came away together about half-past eleven o'clock at night: I was very much intoxicated. We strolled about the streets a considerable time, and some women walked with us. In the morning I found myself in bed with a girl, at a house of ill-fame; I then missed my watch.</p>

I was in company with him for two or three hours; I spent a good deal of money with him, and he then asked me to go and have a spree with him; I said it was late, but I would spend an hour or two with him. We went to the corner of Bow-street, but we could not get into a house there; some girls and some men came up to us; he said he was going with one of them, and asked me to lend him a little silver, which I did - he then said,</p>

I saw Mr. Ford in the Whitsun-week, and shewed him the copper, and some more like it - it is cut out for scale pans.</p>

               <p>Q. Is the cut of this copper different to other pieces? A. Yes, they are cut in a circular manner for scales.</p>

            . I am a coach carver. On the 7th of June I saw Adams leaning against a lamp post, looking on the opposite side of the way; I went to see what he was looking at, and saw Smith coming from the area of Mr. Seaman's house with something tied up in a dirty apron - I said</p>
               <p>"What have you got in the apron;" he dropped it but made no answer; I then took the bundle, and Smith ran away; I saw Connolly then come from the area rails; I collared and took him, with the bundle, into the house, and gave them in custody of the person who opened the door.</p>

On the 16th of June I went to the Half-moon and Crown public-house, Bacon-street - I saw the prisoner and the prosecutor, and some other persons - they went to play in the ground, and then returned to the house to dinner; I staid in the ground and saw the prisoner come and take the handkerchief from the coal pocket; I supposed Salmon had sent for it; they returned to the ground in about a quarter of an hour - Salmon said he should put on his handkerchief as it was rather cold; he went to his coat for it and it was gone; I told him what I had seen. The prisoner returned in about two hours, and I then told him I had seen him take it, which he denied. It was a brown handkerchief with blue bars, and a little edge of white.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. John Vickris Taylor; he has two other partners. Soon after six o'clock on the evening of the 26th of May. I saw the prisoners standing, conversing with the watchman; they then went to a stable which is under the care of Barton; Wortley then went away a little while - when he returned I believe he saw me; he then drew back. I went into the counting-house, and saw him go on towards the stable; I afterwards saw Barton take one of the horses into a small stable across the road, which is used to put a sick horse in - it has been used for a coach-house, and has no stall in it. Barton went in, and shut the door; I then saw Wortley come out of his own stable, with something under his arm, which appeared to be an empty sack, and go into the small stable where Barton was with the horse; I went into an alley between the small stable and Wortley's stable, and waited about five minutes, when I saw Wortley come out with this sack, and about a bushel of beans and oats in it - I seized him; I conceive that no person could fill that sack in the stable without Barton seeing it. I sent for an officer, and they were given in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Are there not some perquisites allowed to the horse-keepers, such as the loose chaff which is swept up? A. I have been there twenty-five years, but never knew any thing of that kind.</p>

In consequence of some suspicion I marked 4 l. in silver, which I put into the till on Sunday night, the 26th of June; I counted it again about nine o'clock on Monday morning: I saw it again on Tuesday morning, but did not count it, but it appeared to be all right; I cannot state what description of money it was; there were crowns, half-crowns, shillings, and sixpences. About ten o'clock on Tuesday morning I came up from the cellar, and saw the prisoners with two others in the bar, and my cousin, Sparkall, was looking out money for them; I went into the yard for about five minutes - when I came in again they were all still there; I took the bag out of the till, and carried it up stairs to count the money; I missed 14 s. 6 d. - I then came down, and sent for an officer: Lee was searched in my presence; 14 s. 6 d. was found in his right-hand breeches pocket, which I could swear to; there were seven shillings, five sixpences, and two half-crowns; he said he had no objection to being searched.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was the man sitting in the bar? A. Yes, he was. He produced the money himself, and laid it on the table - when I came into the room I spoke to him; he saw me take the bag and go up stairs with it. The prisoners had been there on Monday, after I counted the money; some other persons had been there on the Tuesday morning.</p>

I took the silver to the mouth of the bag, took it in my hand, and picked out a new shilling, and gave him - I suppose I might be five minutes doing this; I did not see him take anything: my arm was on it all the time; he put his hand to the corner of the bag, and might have taken it without my seeing him - I did not see him take more than four or five to look at, which he returned. I had my eye upon the money, and did not leave the bar while the men were there.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Acton. On the 16th of June, at three o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in a field opposite to Mr. White's house; he was then going up towards a mare; he took it by the forelocks, and lead it thirty or forty yards, to a shed at the corner of the field; I followed, and found him in the shed with the mare, and asked what business he had with her; he said he had no business, but he wanted to look at her age - I took him to Mr. White's house: there is no road through the field. There were two of Mr. White's halters in the shed - I found none on the prisoner - it was a bay mare - I cannot say whether it was Mr. White's.</p>

I was not quite certain of him at that moment, because his hat was off. I did not wish him to be taken till I was more convinced; the officer led me down the street where he thought he might see somebody who answered more fully. The prisoner came out of the public-house directly after he had seen me, with his hat on - I then told the patrol I was convinced he was the man - he immediately left a person whom he was with, and bolted up a passage; the patrol called him back, and he was taken.

            . I am a patrol. On the 7th of June I was on duty near Great Russell-street, and was informed this lady had been robbed - I met her soon afterwards; she described the man. I took her to this public-house - she went in, and pointed the prisoner out herself; he and two others were there: she said she had every reason to believe he was the man - I desired her to be particular; she said she was not confident, but had every reason to believe he was the man. We went out to see if we could find any one circulating the notes, and in about ten minutes I saw the prisoner with two more, standing, talking together, by the passage door - the prosecutrix said there was the same young man as was in the public-house - his back was towards her; he went into the passage. While we were going up towards him I called him back - he came to the door, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you want with me - why did you not take me when you was in the public-house." The prosecutrix, her husband, and another gentleman consulted for a few minutes - she then said he was the man. He lives at the house which he went into.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He went up the passage before you went up to him? A. Yes. The lady did not speak positively to him till after the consultation. The landlord of the public-house told me there was nobody there who I wanted, for those persons had been there for a considerable time.</p>
               <p>CHARLES RAINSFORD.

            . I am a carpenter, and live at Chelsea. - On the 23d of June, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was in my parlour, in Beaufort-place, and heard a coach coming along <placeName id="t18250630-66-crimeloc320">Duke-street</placeName>

Alford appeared intoxicated - Green was sober.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Alford's not answering you appear to arise from his intoxication? A. He was certainly stupified with the accident. While I was making the inquiry a man crawled out of the carriage window - I put my hand under his arm to assist him; he told me to let him alone, it was all right - he appeared stunned or intoxicated; his name was Burgoyne. At that instant a lantern was brought, and held to the carriage - we then discovered the deceased in a dreadful mangled state; he was dead: I knew him perfectly well - his name was Samuel Featherstone; his body was taken out of the carriage, and carried into a public-house; a vast quantity of blood had come from his head: some neighbours then gave the prisoners in charge - Alford, who was the coachman, said he was ready to go any where; Green was very riotous, and declared he would not go. We could get no information as to the circumstance from either of them. Immediately after the accident happened Green was laughing heartily, which we reproved him for. He broke from the watchman, and got away, and was taken in an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was Featherstone a large heavy man? A. Yes; when I discovered him his head was out of the near side front window - his injury was at the back of the head. There is a deep gutter on the side of the road, and an iron grating over a sink. The carriage laid on the off side of the road, over, or on the grating - the wheel might have gone on the grating, and overturned the coach. Alford's head was very much injured - it was enough to stupify any man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Who took the horses out? A. Green - he was furthest from the carriage (when I came up,) at the horses' heads, as if to prevent their going on; the carriage did not appear to have been dragged. I think the state of the road, assisted by the weight of the deceased, sufficient to cause the overturn. - When Green laughed I thought he was in hysterics, but his conduct afterwards convinced me that was not the case: I have since learned that he had been in liquor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he was laughing did you observe any thing? A. They were saying it was all right. The deceased had not then been discovered.</p>
               <p>Q. If the carriage was driven at a proper rate, was it likely to be overturned? A. Certainly not; carriages pass over it fifty times a day: it was overturned ten or twenty yards from the turning; the road may be thirty or forty yards wide: it is a large open space, at the foot of Battersea-bridge; the coach was in the way from the narrow street to Beaufort-row.</p>

            . I live in Duke-street, Chelsea - four doors from Long. I saw this carriage pass my door at eight o'clock, towards town; it went so fast that I did not notice who drove; it was a sky blue chariot: I was at my door at half-past ten o'clock, and saw it coming back; I do not know who drove; I think there were two persons on the box - it was galloping as fast as the horses could go; I did not hear them whipped; Featherstone put his head out of window, towards the coachman - I cannot say whether he said any thing, but the coachman immediately turned the horses very sharp round into Beaufort-place - the fire flew from the horses' shoes; I saw the carriage overturned in a moment; I cannot tell how it happened; I went up to it in about five minutes - saw Long and several more there. I heard Green's voice but saw neither of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. You live in Duke-street? A. Yes, just at the corner, where it turns into the wide space where Long lives; the coach overturned about twenty yards from my door; Featherstone was leaning out of the left-hand side widow - not the front.</p>

            . I live in the Broadway, between Lombard-street and Duke-street. I was at my window about half-past ten o'clock, and heard a chariot coming down Lombard-street with great rapidity; I opened my window; it stopped suddenly, directly under my window, as a stage coach was coming down to meet it; I saw Featherstone in the chariot, and a stranger: the prisoners were on the box; I cannot say which had the reins - they were both intoxicated - Alford particularly so; I heard them calling to the stage coachman to get out of the way; the stage was walking at a moderate pace; immediately as the coach cleared the chariot they flogged the horses most desperately; the horses started off at a full gallop - I saw them for fifty yards, which is the extent of the street, and heard the carriage go over with a most tremendous crash; the horses went at the same pace till it overturned; their shoes struck fire all the way up the street; I ran down stairs and went to the spot, found the prisoners in custody, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300023"/>put several questions to Alford, but could get no answer; he appeared very drunk - Green was asking why he was given in charge; he broke from the watchman, and was afterwards taken; he appeared sorry for what had occurred; it was known then that the man was killed. There is a grating near to where the coach fell, and a little slope, but there was no danger if they had gone at a proper rate - a hundred carriages pass over it daily - there is a gas light close to the place.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far from the end of the street did it pull up for the stage to pass? A. About fifty yards; my house stands in the broadway, between two narrow streets; it was overturned fifteen or twenty yards from Duke-street, immediately off the stones; the horses started at a full gallop the instant the stage passed - they had been galloping before.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had overturned by the violence of the horses, would they not have dragged it some way after? A. I should think so: Alford said his head was hurt; I had seen him drunk an hour and a half before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Green seemed sorry when he found the man was dead? A. I think so - I have frequently seen him with Featherstone, on friendly terms.</p>

I had a mare which I turned out on the 13th of June, on the common, which is not one hundred poles from my house; she had a log on her foot to prevent her straying; I turned her out about eight in the evening, and did not miss her till between eleven and twelve o'clock next morning, when I saw her passing my house, with the prisoner on her, without either saddle, bridle, or halter; he had a stick in his hand; Pridmore and I were in the cow-house; we ran out and followed him - he was going slowly, and when I got up I asked what he was going to do with the mare; he said Oh, he was going to find the owner, or else take her to the Lord of the manor. Pridmore said I was the owner; I told him to get off four or five times, and when he did I said</p>

               <p>"Oh, it is at a distance from here, I will go and fetch it," but I would not let him go; he said his master was gone on, and he must follow him; but we would not let him; we took him before a Magistrate - he then said he met three gentlemen in a chaise carl, who told him to take the first horse which he got to, and take it to St. Albans to them - but he was coming towards London; he was put into the cage and gave us the name of John Battle. Pridmore asked if his name was not Hartley, and he answered to it. I had had the mare seven years, and knew her well; I sent to the place where he said he had left the log and it was brought to me.</p>

            . I live at South Mimms, and was with Lawrence on the morning of the 14th of June. The prisoner rode by on the mare - I said "There is your mare going by;" I have known it more than six years; we went out and stopped it: I asked what he was going to do with it - he said "I am either going to take it to the right owner, or the Lord of the manor." I said "This is the right owner;" he said "If he is the right owner he must have it." I knew a person named Hartley, who had been abroad six years, and thought, by the prisoner's appearance, that he was Hartley, but cannot say so. I heard Camfield tell him he thought he bought a cart of him six or seven years ago for 7 l., and had paid him 3 l. 10 s., but the rest was not paid; the prisoner said it was so. He said he had taken the mare out of the lane; that the log lay in the Three want way; Lawrence sent his boy for it - he brought it in about an hour and half, with the strap to it. The cow-house is about one hundred poles from the common: he said he met three gentlemen in a gig - they wished him to take the first horse or mare he could lay hold of, and bring it to them at St. Albans, and they would purchase it - but he was going a contrary way.</p>

               <p>"Is your name Hartley?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he: I said,</p>
               <p>"Do you recollect some years ago buying a cart of me for 7 l.?" He said</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do;" I said "Nathaniel Hartley, do you recollect paying me 3 l. 10 s. towards it?" he said</p>

No, for I think he is not in his right senses - it struck me so from his answers - but it looks as if he had some knowledge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300024"/>of buying the cart - but yet I do not think he is in his right senses - he said yes to whatever I asked.</p>

            , ESQ. I live about a mile from Potters-bar. The prisoner was in my service, and left about the second week in May; he is a poor silly fellow, laughed and jeered at by the rest. I believe him as honest a man as ever lived - he had the entire management of about one hundred ewes and rams for me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had he the care of your flock? A. All last winter; he managed them and every thing they were fed with: I considered him fully capable of what he was entrusted with, and that he knew right from wrong - he knew a horse was not his property - he has been about two years in my employ.</p>

            . I am a farmer. The prisoner has been twice in my employ, and is a very honest man: I think him quite insensible, for if you tell him to do one thing he will go and do another; he came to me in July 1818, and remained till old Michaelmas, and came again on the 8th of June, this year. I found him a good deal weaker in his intellects then, and was obliged to discharge him, for he hindered the rest of the men; he offered to lend me 5 l. when I discharged him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What had he to do for you? A. Haymaking at first, and afterwards harvest work and thrashing. I considered him quite devoid of sense, and employed him from charity, but at last could do nothing with him.</p>

I asked where he came from - he said from Uxbridge; I said that was not the Uxbridge road: we went on to the turnpike - I then said he must go with me to the watch-house; he then got on the mare - I said,</p>
               <p>"You are not going to trot me;" he got off, and walked about forty yards, and then got into a field, to ease himself, as he said; I gave him leave, but he ran away, leaving the mare in the road, with me; I followed him, springing my rattle, and calling Stop him! he ran towards the canal, and then came back towards Harrow-road again; I at last caught him, with assistance - I found him laying in the grass; he said, "Don't pull me, I will go quietly:" we took him to the watch-house; he said nothing more about the mare - I delivered it to Bradberry. The mare was put into the watch-house.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper of Paddington. On the 7th of January, about four o'clock in the morning, the prisoner was brought in by Brown; I took him before a Magistrate, and had the mare in my possession till she was delivered to the prosecutor, at Mary-le-bone office. I found quite a new nail in its off fore foot - it seemed to have been fresh put in on purpose; it was driven close in up to the head - we were obliged to cut it out with a knife. She recovered before she was delivered to the prosecutor, but at first was so lame we could hardly get her along; the prosecutor knew her directly.</p>

On the 15th of March I saw him with her in Bruton-street, Regent-street; he said she would do in harness: I put her into harness as he recommended her strongly. I tried her, and bought her of him for 30 l., and a black mare; he told me he had her of a pig-jobber, at Smithfield, named Baker, who lived at Hackney, and had had her a week or ten days.</p>

               <p>"This will do," and putting it into his pocket. ran out with it; I ran out, and never lost sight of him till he was taken, and I took the watch out of his hand - it is second-hand, but is worth 50 s. I would give above 40 s. for it, to sell again.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Charles, a tailor, of Fleet-street; he lives opposite to Mr. Haynes. On the 22d of May, about half-past seven o'clock in the evening, I saw two men and a woman standing at Mr. Haynes's door; I was looking out of window, and saw Pugh standing with his hat off, and his hands behind him, outside the door, as if he was master of the house; I am certain of his person. I went down stairs, came up again, and saw them still there; about eight o'clock I stood looking out of the window, which was open, and I think they observed me. About a quarter past eight I saw Pugh beckon to a coach, which then drew up to Mr. Haynes's door, which was open all the time. - Some person then came and rang at our street door bells which took me from the window, and when I got to the door nobody was there; the coach was still at Mr. Haynes's door, but when I got up to the window again it had drawn off; I did not see any thing put into it, for the bell rang immediately it drew up; the persons I had seen there before were gone: the door appeared to be closed. Next morning I heard the shop had been robbed, and told what I had seen.</p>

            . I live at No. 5, New Finsbury-market, and am waiter at the Eagle tavern, City-road. I did not know Pugh was in custody till he wrote me a letter, addressed,</p>

They left my boxes, and went to where Edwards waits.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You never saw him before? A. Never - he was in company with two more, whom I have not seen since; I should know them again. We had a good deal of company.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to notice them particularly? A. When they left my box I asked them for a compliment for the waiter; they said they would take tea and return to my box: they had had some half and half, and pipes with me. I noticed them to see if they would return to my box, as they promised to give me something.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps then you can tell what time they left? A. No, I took no further notice after; I left them to the other waiter.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you could not be watching to see if they would return to your box? A. I did for a few minutes; it might be ten minutes; they went to the box, No. 1 or 2 - mine are 10 and 11 - they would not pass my boxes to go out; I did not notice how his companions were dressed - one was tall and the other rather short - Pugh was tallest, the others about one height: I should know their faces again - one was rather fair, and the other rather a dark complexion - two came in first, and the others joined them in about ten minutes; I did not inquire if they were gone, for if people do not give me money when I ask, I think<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300027"/>very little of it afterwards: I have been a waiter at the London Tavern, and the London Coffee-house, and the Albion.</p>

            . On Whitsunday I was waiter at the Eagle. Pugh came into my box a few minutes after seven; the prisoner Edwards was with him and another man; they ordered tea for two, which they had; the other man sat by them, they had a pot of half-and-half, and three pipes, and remained there till after eight; there was a dispute at the bar with one of the waiters about the time they left; Pugh said a had overcharged them: Robinson desired me to attend before the Alderman, to state this; there was a letter sent to the Eagle; I do not think I should know the third man again, but the prisoner I know perfectly well; I explained to Pugh about what I charged him, and he was satisfied.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you a constant waiter there? A. No, only occasional; they were all three strangers to me; the other man was not quite so tall as Edwards: I do not remember whether Robinson complained of their behaving shabby to him: when Pugh called for tea two gentlemen sent me to see the time - it was a quarter past seven; I was delayed at the bar by a dispute, and looked at the clock when I came away; I know it was Whitsunday because I have not been engaged there since.</p>

               <p>"Gentlemen your segars and half-and-half are not paid for;" they looked at Edwards, and said they thought he had paid; Pugh wrote a letter to Mr. Lowther, requesting me to attend at Guildhall, which I did.</p>

               <p>"This man has been picking my pocket;" he said he was very sorry, and begged my pardon, and hoped I should not do any thing to him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I hope you will forgive me, as I am innocent. As I was in Tottenham-court-road I looked at a dog, whom I thought was going to bite me: I kicked him - a coachman came up and struck me with his whip; I asked him what he did that for; he said he would do it again - I then struck him and he struck me, and I ran away.</p>

               <p>"Certainly" - she put it on the table, and said she would call in about half an hour; she did not call that day, and next day I looked into it, and saw there were four gowns in it.

I said, if she would go in doors with me I would give her the 2 s. - she agreed to go with me, and was with me in the room for about a quarter of an hour; my wife was not at home - the room door was locked while we were there: I gave her the 2 s., and had all this money in my pocket, which I missed when she was gone: it was in a bag; I went out and found her in a cook-shop in George-street; I called the watchman, and she was taken to the watch-house; the money was found on her there; I went before the Magistrate at Marlborough-street - I do not know whether he dismissed the charge.</p>

I took the copper and lead to the prosecutor - it exactly fitted the place, and the lead corresponded with what was left.</p>

At the latter end of May he brought some malt from Kingston to London; I saw Gibbons come on board the barge, which was a-ground at Scotland yard; he was loading the waggon with the malt, to go to Coombe and Delafield's; I saw him take some malt out of two sacks; and another man who was with him, helped him to put it into a sack, which it filled, and they tied it up, and put it into the waggon - all the malt was put into the waggon, except eight sacks, which were left behind in the barge; Hammerton was in the barge at the time, but I cannot tell whether he saw it or not: the barge floated again about eleven o'clock, and we were waiting for the empty sacks to come back, to return to Kingston; they had the name of Richard Gally on them; Mr. Gally is dead, and his widow carries on the business; we had got the sacks back, and were going to Woolwich to get sand, when the officers came on board; a man of the name of Missen had come on board, and told me the eight sacks of malt had better be covered with a tarpauling, and Hammerton said I should do so; I said I had done it; the malt was not taken out of the sacks at the time of the last delivery - there was another delivery after Gibbons had gone away with the waggon.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Hammerton hear what Missen said? A. Not to my knowledge - he was in the cabin, and said the tarpauling had better be pulled over, and I said I had done it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESSWELL. Q. Is it not customary to carry empty sacks in your barge to empty damaged sacks into? A. Yes; I had seen Gibbons before in Scotland-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. If he found a damaged sack was it not his duty to shoot it into another? A. Yes. Hammerton was in the cabin when Gibbons took the malt out. Sacks are sometimes short.</p>
               <p>Q. In re-shooting the malt, is not some spilt sometimes? A. No, there are sacks placed all round and they are emptied into a measure, and returned into a sack: I cannot tell how many sacks we had on board - there were 380<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300034"/>quarters of malt; the malt taken out by Gibbons was put into a sack, and that was put into the waggon. We sometimes assist one another on the river - but I should not have taken any sacks on board, without my master's knowledge. I do not know whether he had given any orders for that malt or not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Suppose any sack of malt had been taken on board on the voyage, must you not have known it? A. I might not, because I was sometimes on shore - some of the malt was re-measured by meters, while Gibbons was there, before it was taken out of the two sacks.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any sacks on board marked</p>
               <p>"Gally," that were not measured? A. Yes, they only measured four sacks. Gibbons and two other persons, whom I do not know, unloaded the malt.</p>

            . I live at Messrs. Coombe and Delafield's. I received 390 quarters of malt from Mrs. Gally's barge - that was 780 sacks; when they came to the brew-house they were very slack - I examined them and saw that several sacks had been fresh tied - I cannot say how many - I pitched twenty-one sacks, all of which had been untied; I put them aside till I had unloaded the waggon; I then weighed them, and found them greatly deficient in weight - some of them 20 lbs. short.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does not the meter take samples at the wharf? A. He takes samples of about four sacks - that would account for their being untied: I was not on the wharf at the time the meter took samples of these - the warehouse to which our sacks of malt are slung up is fifty or sixty feet high.</p>

            . I am brewer at Messrs. Coombe and Delafield's. I saw the twenty-one sacks - they were all deficient in weight - they have been measured since by a meter, and were all deficient - they were sixteen bushels of malt deficient in the whole - in six sacks there was a deficiency of two bushels; I saw them measured at Scotland-yard, before they were loaded - they were then all correct - I think the meter measured three sacks which he took indiscriminately - the remainder were not measured - the twenty-one sacks appeared to have been all opened when we received them home. This grain was bought by our firm, but I do not know that it was paid for: Hammerton was captain of the barge.</p>

            . I am a Thames-police officer. I went on board the barge Wellington on the 1st of June, with Mr. Gally's foreman and another man; she was shifted to the outside of the barges, ready to go away - I saw Hammerton on board, and asked if he was the master of the barge - he said he was; I had not then told him what I came about. I asked what he had got in the barge - he said empty sacks; I asked if all the malt was delivered - he said it was: I then proceeded to turn over a number of empty sacks, which laid in a bulk in the barge; while I was doing that, he said</p>
               <p>"There are eight sacks of malt under that tarpauling;" I said</p>
               <p>"You just now told me all your malt was delivered - how came you to tell me that?" he said he did not know; I asked him who it belonged to - he said he did not know. I then turned the tarpauling on one side, and under seven or eight other tarpaulings, I found eight sacks of malt, most of them marked Richard Gally, Kingston. I think one of them was different, but they were all in the name of Gally. I then took him and the malt, on board the police ship. I asked his name, his employer's name, and the barge's name; he said it was enough for him to be answerable for what he had done himself - that there were only four sacks of this malt that belonged to him, and for them he had paid the man who carried it out of the barge to the cart, to go to the brew-house, and the other four sacks were brought on board by Dick Missen, out of Downe's barge, that morning, and they had shifted them out of Downe's sacks into Gally's; Missen has absconded, and the other two men who assisted to carry the malt out of the barge. I then went to Battle-bridge, and found Gibbons in the Pindar of Wakefield, public-house. I told him he was wanted to go to the brewhouse about some malt being short: I put him in a chaise, and took him to the ship, where Hammerton was, and I heard Green, my brother officer, ask Hammerton, if that was the man he had given the sovereign to for the malt, and he said it was - Gibbons denied it, and Hammerton said</p>
               <p>"It is useless denying it, the boy has told all about it, and you may as well tell the truth." Gibbons then said he had received a sovereign, but he did not know what Hammerton gave it him for.</p>

The prisoners came in together on Saturday, the 25th of June, and asked for some silk shawls; I showed them three or four - they all looked at them, and said they were too dear; one of them (I think Burke) then asked to look at some cotton shawls - I showed them some, which they said would not wash; Burke then asked me to shew them some lace: I showed them a box of lace, and on turning it out I saw Burke take one piece, and place it under the corner of Cottar's shawl, which laid on the counter; Burke had an apron on, which she folded up on the counter, and passed the lace from under the shawl, under the apron, and gave it to Bergin - they did not buy any lace from that box. Cottar asked to see some Urling's lace, but before I showed that I went and told Mr. Fry what I had seen - he placed himself behind them: I then showed them a box of Urling's lace, and they bought three yards, at 1 s. 6 1/2 d. per yard, which they paid for amongst them; I wrapped it up, and gave it to them, and as they were going out Mr. Fry told them to come back - they came back to the passage; Cottar and Burke stood on one side, and Bergin on the other. - Mr. Fry then accused them of having the lace, which they denied - he went for an officer, and I saw the lace laying on the ground, just by where Bergin stood, in the passage; I took it up, and said,</p>
               <p>"This is the lace." Cottar fell on her knees, and offered me 10 s. to let them go, as she was married, and had two children.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. And so though you saw a felony committed, you thought it right to sell lace, and take money? A. Yes, I did - they had been before that morning; I had not urged them to come back when they had sold their fish to buy a shawl.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>BURKE'S Defence. We went into the shop in the morning, and bought an apron for 1 s. 6 d.; the shopman said,</p>
               <p>"Don't you want a shawl?" I said,</p>
               <p>"I have no money, we have laid out all our money in mackarel" - we went in again to look at a shawl, and he said to me,</p>
               <p>"Don't you want to buy a shawl;" we looked at them - Cottar then bought some lace, and as we were going out we were charged with taking this lace. I can be upon my oath that I had no shawl - he then said I had put it under Bergin's shawl. He took us into the back parlour, and then turned round, and found the lace by the back door; the man said at the office first that he saw her drop it, and then he said he only thought so.</p>
               <p>BERGIN'S Defence. I had but 14 s. 9 d. in my pocket, and the shawls were too dear. We looked at some lace; Burke bought three yards - I lent her 1 s., and Cottar lent her 2 s. - he said when we were going away, he saw her take the lace, and shift it to the other prisoner; he had enticed us all day, and said in the morning,</p>
               <p>"Go and turn your mackarel into money, and come and buy a shawl for to-morrow;" and when we came back he charged us with the robbery.</p>
               <p>COTTAR'S Defence. If the shopman spoke truly he cannot say that he saw me take the lace.</p>

I did not compare it with what was left.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were you doing while the jacket laid on the stones? A. I was watching about the premises; I kept my eyes upon the jacket; no person went to it; there were persons at work on the premises, but not on that spot. Other persons might have gone to it; the prisoner could see me as clearly as I saw him. When he went to dinner I took his jacket, and I suppose he saw me, and at six o'clock he came and demanded his wages, and asked for his jacket; I told him it was at Mr. Lee's and he would pay him. I will not swear I did not ask him anything about the lead - it is very likely that I did. He was taken on the Monday following, at Mr. Lee's office, in Chiswell-street.</p>

The prisoner was never in partnership with me; he came to live with me. and desired me to take care of his cow while he went into the country, where he said he had a great deal of property; his cow was a black one, with a white face - mine was all black; I never made him a present of it; he did not go into the country, but was taken ill at my house; he assisted in carrying out my milk, and drove my cow round to serve the milk - I used to call the white-faced one his own. On the 5th of May I missed mine, and have not seen it since; he went out in the morning and should return at nine o'clock, but did not; I found him in Rosemary-lane at three o'clock in the afternoon, and asked how he came to take my black cow; he said he had sold her, and got the money in his pocket, and if he had done wrong he must answer for it. I said if he did not return it I must take him before a Magistrate, and he would be transported; he said if he had done wrong he must stand the consequences of it; I applied to the Magistrate, who granted a summons - we went before the Magistrate, who heard a few words, and said he was too busy to attend to it, but if I thought he had stolen it I must go to the sessions, which were on, and indict him - I did so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where did you first become acquainted with him? A. In the King's Bench prison; I did not employ him to carry on my business while I was there - I never borrowed a penny of him, but he borrowed twelve sovereigns of me and some clothes; I never gave him a bill of exchange - I gave Rogers a bill which he now holds, as I owe him 1 l. 5 s. on it; he lent me the money to pay for the two cows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come forward as the prisoner's friend, and pay for the cows for you? A. No; the prisoner has arrested me, last Wednesday three weeks, for 40 l., but I owe him nothing: Rogers took me out of my bed, and offered to liberate me if I would give up this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign a written agreement with Rogers or the prisoner? A. I signed a deed on the 4th of May; it was to pay ground rent; Rogers has concealed the cow, for he acknowledged it - the Magistrate did not commit the prisoner.</p>

I and Beasley concealed ourselves in the prosecutor's bed-room; I was behind the curtain, and about half-past ten o'clock I heard a gentle noise at the front room door, and in a minute the prisoner entered the bed-room at the door between that and the front room - she opened the door - the gas shone through the window, and I think she saw us, for she was retreating, when I seized her - she lodges in the next floor over the bed-room: I said</p>
               <p>"We have got the thief at last - how came you here?" she said she thought she heard some one in the room, and came to see who it was: we had made no noise: Beasley took a key out of the door and delivered it to me; I took her up stairs to search her room - she turned round, and locked me into her room, took the key out, and ran down stairs; I called out of the window, and the watchman stopped her - I found nothing in her room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had been in the room some time? A. About two hours; I searched her before she escaped - she had none of their property. The Magistrate admitted her to bail - she was indicted and taken up on the bill.</p>

I requested them to leave, but I could not turn them out. I have been married six weeks; I have often been into her room for a light, and different things, before I was married; and she often made my bed on a Sunday, before I was married - I then lived in the attic - she never had the key of the room she entered - it was on the first floor.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If she heard a noise it was natural to go and see who it was? A. Yes, but my room door was locked, and the key in my pocket - the front room door, and the door on the landing place, were locked - the door between the two rooms was not locked.</p>
               <p>MORRIS. She came through the front room into the bed-room; I took a strange key out of the lock.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you both in the room at the same time? A. Beazley went out of the bed-room into the front room at eight o'clock, to see that the door was fast.</p>

On the 21st of May, at ten o'clock in the morning, I washed the plate, and set it in the window of a small front room to dry; soon afterwards Miss Whitaker spoke to me - I saw the door open, and that the plate was gone; twenty-four spoons, twelve forks, three ladles, two skewers, two pair of sugar tongs, a cheese knife, and a child's boat, were gone, with the tray in which I had put them. I ran out to the gate as fast as I could, and saw two men driving away in a one-horse cart, very fast; it was about twenty rods from the gate; I ran to Mr. Phips, a farmer, close by, and borrowed a horse, pursued the cart, but did not see it again till I got on the Edgware road, a mile and a half off; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300041"/>traced it by the marks of the wheels, and as soon as I got into the Edgware road I saw it, and am sure it was the same cart; I hallooed Stop thief! there were a great many people about - they went a good deal faster when I called out, and turned into a lane, which goes up to Oxden farm; both the men then jumped out of the cart and creeped through the hedge: I took the horse and cart, with the horse I was on, to Mr. Lardner's (I was within ten rods of the men); Lardner came out with his servant Jones; Jones and I ran down the lane, and were directed after them; Jones pursued; I found sixteen pieces of the plate in the cart, and the rest scattered about the gate, and some a little way from the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did the plate lay? A. By the window, which was a little way open. I am sure it was the same cart - it was a dirty blue colour; I rode a mile and a half before I saw them again; they went on a quarter of a mile and turned up the lane, and jumped out; I might have been ten minutes gone to Mr. Lardner's.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Lardner, who lives in Wilsden parish. In consequence of what Layt said to me, I went in pursuit down the lane; he shewed me which way they had gone through the hedge, about one hundred yards from the Edgware road; people who stood in the road, directed me across the fields; I saw one man returning across the other side of the fields as fast as he could; I followed, and kept him in sight about a mile, and then lost sight of him for about two minutes, and caught sight of him again; he was the same person, and dressed the same; I am quite certain it was the same; he got into another field: I followed him nearly a mile further, and got nearly close to him; he was then stopping on a hedge, and appeared to be pulling off his shoes and stockings; he looked round, and saw me coming, and started off with his stocking half-way down and one shoe off; I ran about ten rods, and secured him; he was very hot, and just as I got to him, he tumbled down on the hedge, and was very much out of breath; I told him he was charged with stealing plate, and must go with me; he said he was innocent; I asked what made him run away; he made no answer: I asked if he had pulled off his stockings to disguise himself; he said nothing to that, and I gave him in charge.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When Layt came to you did he leave the cart at your master's house? A. Yes; the lane is about two hundred yards from our house; we both ran down the lane, leaving the cart there; the two fields together are nearly half a mile large: I dare say they are fourteen acres each; he ran nearly half a mile.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Edgware road is a great thorough-fare? A.

I saw the boy who stopped behind come from the shop in two or three minutes, and give the prisoner something; they all went towards the turnpike; they ran part of the way. I lost sight of them.</p>

               <p>SARAH DUNDON. I am a widow, and lodge in a second floor back room, at Richard Snugg's; the prisoner lived on the same floor with a young man, as her husband. On the 21st of June I turned up my bedstead, and went out about noon; the blankets and counterpane were then in the bedstead; I think I locked the door. I returned in a quarter of an hour, and found it was not locked, but I was not sure that I had left it locked. I went out again about six o'clock - I am sure I locked it then, and took the key; I had missed nothing then. On coming home at nine I found the door unlocked, but shut, and about eleven I was going to bed, but on turning the bedstead down I missed a counterpane and two blankets; the prisoner was not at home: I saw her at one o'clock next day but one, in custody of a watchman. I cannot say whether Mrs. Snugg was out or in when I went out; she was at home at nine o'clock, and is seldom out. The street door is always kept shut. I have a key to let myself in.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Mr. Turner, a builder, whose premises are in Moorfields. On the 20th of May the prisoners came to the yard together, and said Mr. Jones sent them for some slates: Jones works for a person who finds slates and he labour; they said they wanted twenty-five slates, and that they worked for Jones, and were going to take these to No. 22, Finsbury-square, to finish a job for him: I believed their story, and they took them. In about an hour and a half, I had reason to think I was deceived, and next morning I saw them in the new North road - they were secured and denied the charge, but afterwards owned it.</p>

On Monday, the 6th of June, the prisoner Kidson came to our shop alone, and said he wanted some patterns of black cloth for his father - I gave him some, and he left the shop; and in about half an hour he returned, and said, would I let his father have two yards of black cloth on credit till evening - he produced one of the patterns I had given him. I let him have it, but rather doubted him, as we always give his father credit when he wants it. I directed my brother to follow him.</p>

He went through Three Fox-court, Long-lane, and there Davis joined him; they went into Charter-house-square, down White Hart-court, into the Pig-market; I there got an officer, and we followed them to a pawnbroker's, in Fleet-market; Kidson went in, and Davis waited outside; he came out without the cloth, and joined Davis - we secured them, and found the duplicate on Kidson.</p>

            . My maiden name was Bunning - when I was single I had 1380 l. in the Navy 5 per cents. - the late Mr. Hippuff was my broker; he died about the end of 1815: the defendant represented to me that he had succeeded him, and became my broker; I lived at Leicester. I authorized him to receive my dividends; 20 l. was afterwards added to my stock, which made it 1400 l.; he continued regularly to receive my dividends. In January, 1817, I paid 130 l. into the hands of Messrs. Pares and Co., bankers, of Leicester, and wrote to inform him of it.</p>
               <p>This letter was here produced by the Defendant, and was as follows: -</p>
               <p>SIR, - Having been favoured with your favour of the 4th instant, I beg to inform you there is 130 l. paid into the hands of the bankers, Messrs. Pares and Padget, of this town, in favour of you; therefore you will please to call for it, any day this week - I think Saturday will be the best day, as then you will be sure to have it paid to you, and after paying yourself for your trouble, and the expences of my letters, please to receive the dividend due on my former stock, and add that and the above 130 l. to the whole, and when convenient send me the receipt.</p>
               <p>Yours, &amp;c. H. Bunning.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Pares and Heygate, of New Bridge-street, who correspond with Messrs. Pares and Padget, of Leicester. (Looking at a cheque;) this was paid at our house, in one Bank note of 100 l., and another of 30 l.; it is drawn by S. Pawsey.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you pay it yourself? A. Yes; the entry is in my writing: I cannot tell to whom I paid it.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you pay the money to the person who signed the cheque? A. Yes. It is dated January, 1817.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEITH. The signature to this cheque is in the defendant's hand-writing. I came to town about the 10th of July, 1818, and spoke to him about having bought my money into the 5 per cents.; he informed me that he had laid out 165 l. for me in the Navy 5 per cents. I told him I was coming to town to reside, and should not have occasion to trouble him to receive the dividends in future, and begged him to go to the Bank with me to see that all was right, and receive the dividend then due; he said if I would call in a few days he would go, as he was very busy, and I might depend upon it that all was right. I had received my dividends from him regularly as they became due; the half yearly dividend had increased from 35 l. to 39 l. odd. I had no other stock but Navy 5 per cents. I went to him in a few days, and said,</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Pawsey, will you go with me to the Bank, to receive my dividend on my 1570 l. odd?" which was the sum I understood I had; he said he had been and received the dividend, and that I had nothing to do in future but to go to the Bank next January, and receive it myself, and that would cancel the power of attorney; I asked for the dividend which he had received - he seemed confused, said he had not got the money about him, but would call or send it next day, or the day after; his uncle, Downes, called and left 39 l. odd at my house - I believe it came at two different times. This letter is in his hand-writing;</p>
               <p>(looking at it.)</p>
               <p>This letter was here read, stating that 4 l. 6 s. 9 d. was enclosed, being the balance of the July dividend, and apologising for not having sent it before.</p>
               <p>MRS. KEITH. These two sums made up the dividend. Soon after this I went to the Bank alone, and inquired at the Navy 5 per cent. office. I afterwards saw Pawsey, and said to him,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Pawsey, I have something against you;" he said,</p>
               <p>"What is it? I hope you received your July dividend right?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you have never made the purchase of the 165 l., which you told me you had in the letter you sent me;" he appeared very much confused, and said,</p>
               <p>"Did you look over the books yourself?" I said,</p>
               <p>"I did, and the clerk also, which was much better;" he then said,</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, but through distressing circumstances I was obliged to apply the money to my own use;" I said,</p>
               <p>"I could not have thought it possible that you would have disgraced so highly respectable a gentleman as your friend and mine, Mr. Hippuff:" he said he was extremely sorry for it, and if I would give him fourteen days from that time, he would assuredly make the purchase - I left him, and at the expiration of the fourteen days went to the Bank, and not being satisfied I went to his office, where I saw a man, named Eaton, but I could not find him. I did not see him till the latter end of September, or October; I had related the circumstance to my friends, and had him arrested - he gave some paper to my attorney, and was liberated. I have never received a shilling, nor was it ever invested for my use. All my stock was transferred at my marriage into the hands of trustees. I received the dividends myself afterwards. I married in February, 1822. I have never received more than 35 l. a half year. I saw him in the Insolvent Debtors' Court in 1819, and have seen him two or three times since; he has made an apology for the injury he has done me, and promised I should not lose a shilling of the money, for if I would give him time he would make it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300046"/>good, and prove his honest intention; but I have not received a shilling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Has he not since last Session, offered you security for the money? A. He said he would make the purchase good if I would give him more time. He was imprisoned about two months after I saw him in the Insolvent Court - I opposed his discharge. I have heard him say that it was through Eaton's misconduct that he had been obliged to use the money. - I do not know what has become of Eaton.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever hear of Eaton before you came to town? A. I had received a letter signed Eaton, enclosing a 10 l. note, in part payment of a dividend, and stating that Pawsey was out of town, and that the remainder should be paid into the banker's for me to receive, which was done - this was in July, 1817. I never considered Eaton as his partner.</p>

            . I am the prosecutrix's brother, and have applied to the defendant on many occasions, respecting this money, up to July, 1824, and always received a promise - he never offered any security.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know how many years he has been in prison since your sister lost her money? A. I know he was there from November 1819, to March 1820, when he gave bail. I have been one hundred miles after him since - I never found him in prison. On the 14th of January, 1824, he gave me a promissory note of 5 l., as part of the interest. I took it without my sister's knowledge; it was not paid.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS addressed the Jury on behalf of the defendant, and called three witnesses, who deposed to his good character.</p>

               <p>"Not this morning." I pursued him and took him in Stingo-lane, and found three pairs of stockings on him, and a pair of wrist cuffs.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live about ten yards from Mr. Beckley. On the 25th of June, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner and another (whom I had noticed playing before my shop) coming out of Mr. Beckley's house; he called to me that they had robbed his till; we pursued. Mr. Beckley took the prisoner; the other got away. When the prisoner was brought back, I searched him, and found two half-crowns, a sixpence, a halfpenny, and a knife.</p>
               <p>AARON BECKLEY. On Saturday evening, between six and seven o'clock, I had left my shop for about two minutes, and gone into the kitchen; while I was there my niece said some one had been into the shop, and gone out again; I went into the shop and saw the till drawn partly out - I pursued the prisoner with Howard, and took him - I found the money on him, as he stated - there was a crown in the till, and other silver, but I cannot swear there were any half-crowns; I missed about 25 s.. The prisoner asked me why I took him - I said he had robbed my till; he said he had not - he had been with another boy - he said he was in no employ, but carried vegetables from Covent-garden market.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into this cook's-shop to get a pennyworth of pudding: I knocked twice, and no one came; I went out, and was pursued and accused of robbing the prosecutor: the money found on me was my own<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300049"/>- there had been another customer in the shop, but they could not get served.</p>

I was on their premises on the 3d of June, and received some information: I was desired to watch opposite their premises, in the surgery of Mr. Holmer, on the 6th of June. About half-past eight o'clock that morning, while their clerk was gone to breakfast, I saw Stretch (who had the care of the premises) come to the door and look backwards and forwards for about a quarter of an hour - he was then joined by Palmer - they went into the warehouse together - Palmer came out soon after, and turned towards Fish-street - Stretch then went into a back yard, and took a ladder - he went up into a loft, and brought down a wrapper, which he spread in the warehouse; he then went into the yard, took a pair of steps and went into the store, and fetched down a side of bacon, which he put into the wrapper; Palmer then returned, followed by Brimble, who went to the back of the warehouse, and Palmer watched at the door; Stretch helped Brimble up with the bacon, and he went into the street. I then left Mr. Holmes's premises and followed him; I said</p>
               <p>"Where did you get that bacon?" he said round there; I turned round and saw Palmer at the end of the street, looking to see what I was about; I asked Brimble where he was going to take the bacon to? he said to a man of the name of Coomley, in Globe road. I said he must come back, and I would make some inquiry: I took him to Mr. Yeates' house, in Great Trinity-lane - he was taken into the parlour, and an officer was sent for: I asked him how long he had known Stretch; he said about two years; I said</p>
               <p>"Have you not known him ten years?" he said perhaps he might; I asked if he did not know him when he was transported - he said yes, he did.</p>

On Saturday, the 25th, I found the trunks which had been in the counting house, packed up, and standing in the hall, and a copper boiler, a square box, and a strap, all lying by it, ready to be removed; I saw a string fastened to the latch of the door, and the other end of it in a place where there could be some boards moved, and the door opened: I found a pane of glass cut out, by which they could open the latch of the window: I found a door open leading to the roof of the house, and a counting-house stool removed to near the trap door, with foot marks on it; I went down stairs again, and opened the trunks, in which I found the lead; I went to the attics again, and the lead had been stripped from the dormer: I sent for Smith, the officer - shewed him the state of the premises, and gave him charge of them from that day till the Monday - when I came down again, about half-past twelve at noon, and found a cart standing at the door, with the two trunks, the square box, and the night stool in it, which I knew to be the same that had been in the hall. I had the lead taken out, and saw it fitted to the dormer, and found it corresponded exactly in all the cuttings and indentations of it - it weighed 279 lbs - I marked it with my initials.</p>

I saw another hat on the floor, and I asked him where his partner was - he said he had none. He was taken to the watch-house, and I commenced a search on the premises, with another witness. I went on the roof, and saw some person had gone down the pan chimney; I called, and desired him to come up or go down, but I got no answer - I then threw down some bits of tiles, and then some whole tiles. I then took a brick, and told him if he did not answer I would throw the brick down upon him; I held it three or four minutes, but as I got no answer I threw it down; some person then groaned, and Hack fell to the bottom, and was taken. I found on the roof a piece of lead cut off, and partly rolled up - it was quite served, and removed three or four inches; a rope was slung round it. I saw it compared, and it fitted exactly. I found a knife and a chisel on the leads, close to where it had been cut; in the lower part of the floor I found a basket, with three sacks in it, in the cock loft, and an old saw on the roof, and a piece of iron, which I had left in the lower floor, when I had been on the premises, two or three days before.</p>

            . I was porter to Mr. Nightingale, of Leadenhall-street. I was cleaning the windows on the morning of the 8th of June, and saw the prisoner and another person standing about the street some time - the prisoner went into Mr. Simpson's shop, and brought out this piece of cloth on his left shoulder, and his hat in his hand - I gave an alarm, and he threw down the cloth and ran away; I ran after him, but lost sight of him while he turned the corners. I did not see him stopped - I came back with him when he was stopped; I am sure he is the same person - he was running when he turned the corners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had he not his back to you? A. Yes, but I can swear to his person; I was looking more at him than at his companion. His nose is on one side, and I knew him by his complexion likewise - I remarked both.</p>

            . I am porter to Mr. Simpson. I was outside the door on the morning in question, and a man came and spoke to me. The last witness then came to me, and said,</p>
               <p>"Do you see that man - he has taken a piece of cloth out of your shop;" I looked at him, and saw the cloth on his shoulder; I did not see his face: I saw the cloth thrown down; I ran from the door to where the cloth was; I saw him run down Lime-street, but I returned to my master's shop, and gave the alarm; the prisoner was brought back by an officer in a few minutes, and there were persons who never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you see the prisoner now? A. I cannot see him very well, but I have seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any thing particular in his face? A. No, not that I know of.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! about half-past eight o'clock that morning, when I was opposite the East to India House - I turned round, and saw the prisoner drop the cloth; he then took his hat in his left hand, and ran down Lime-street. I lost sight of him at the corner of Cullum-street - a butcher stopped him - I came up, and took charge of him - I am certain of his person; I was within twenty yards of him. This is the cloth, which I received from a house just by where he dropped it; about twelve doors off.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is the person here who took it up? A. No - it was one of the East India Company's men who took it, and it was taken into a house for about five minutes, for security.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182506300054"/>Q. Do you know that it is the same cloth that was dropped? A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I would ask, if my nose is so remarkable, as that any person can say it is on one side of my face; I have not got a false nose. I have never been in such a situation in my life before.</p>

            . I know the prisoner. I have seen him write once. I saw him write this (looking at a letter).</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the paper on the other side; do you believe it to be his hand writing? A. Yes, (No. 1). I believe the signature</p>
               <p>"F. Wilson" to this (No. 2), to be his writing. (Looking at two other letters.) I believe these to be his hand-writing. On the 20th of January, I saw Mr. Morse and the prisoner at the Vine Inn, Bishopsgate-street, about ten o'clock in the morning: I was there first, and found the prisoner there. I said to him,</p>
               <p>"You don't know Mr. Morse, and you should make some inquiry as to his respectability before you do business with him." When Mr. Morse came, the prisoner said he would discount any bill which he chose to draw at 5 per cent. discount, and 2 s. 6 d. per cent. commission. He said that his brother-in-law Oglivie kept an account with the Bank of England; that they got their bills discounted at 3 per cent, and were contented with the other 2 per cent. for risk and the commission. Mr. Morse assented at once, and asked how he was to draw the bill. The prisoner at first told him, and then Morse said,</p>
               <p>"You had better write it down." The prisoner wrote down at the back of the letter what I have identified as having seen him write, and Morse copied it on a stamp, which he had sent the waiter out for.</p>
               <p>Q. When they met, did they address each other by name? A. We had first understood from the waiter at the Vine Inn that his name was Wilson, and we addressed him as Wilson, I believe. - Mr. Morse said he had received a letter signed Oglivie, which he produced; and that had brought him up to town. He asked if his name was Oglivie - he said it was Wilson; and that he did business for his brother-in-law Mr. Oglivie. He wrote the copy of the bill on the back of the letter, which Morse produced. When the bill was drawn, the prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"On the Wednesday following you shall receive the money." The note was put into the prisoner's hands; (looking at it) this is it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You saw him write but once, and that was when he wrote the form of the note? A. Yes; and I saw him at the same time write a letter to a Mr. Markworth, and do believe this endorsement to be his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Look at the endorsement again? A. I think it is the same writing as I saw on the back of the letter, and on the letter written to Markworth, and, I believe, the letters produced to be his writing.</p>
               <p>These letters were here read, as follow: -</p>
               <p>No. 1. was addressed to Mr. Morse, at Daventry, dated January, 1825 - stating, that having been informed by a gentleman on 'Change, that he (Mr. Morse) was in want of a sum of money, and offering to discount his bill. - signed,

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to THOMAS VECK. Q. In what position did you sit when he wrote the note? A. On the opposite side of the table, so close that I could see what he wrote. Mr. Morse is my brother-in-law - he has been sued on the note, and has filed a bill in Equity.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When was the letter written to Markworth? A. The same morning, my Lord. I saw him direct it after the note was drawn. He said he had some money transactions with him; we afterward saw the letter on the mantel piece. I took it up, and looked at the direction - it was sealed. I had not seen the contents - I was there when he wrote and directed it.</p>

            . I live at Northampton. I know the prisoner, and have seen him London; he went by the name of Oglivie. I saw him twice - he answered to the name of Oglivie overnight when I saw him at the Ram Inn, and next morning answered to the name of Wilson. I inquired at the Ram for him by the name of Oglivie. I had called there in consequence of receiving a letter, signed</p>
               <p>"Oglivie." I answered that letter by saying, I should be at the Ram, and there I met him; he answered to that name, but next morning drew a bill, and signed it</p>
               <p>"Wilson." I then told him, I had not a very good opinion of him, and could not think of signing any bill, because he had written to me in the name of Oglivie. He was going to cash this bill for me, but I objected to accept on account of his using two names; he said he had a brother-in-law of the name of Oglivie.</p>
