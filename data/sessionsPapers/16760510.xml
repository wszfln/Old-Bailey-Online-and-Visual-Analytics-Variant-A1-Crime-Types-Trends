               <p>THe Malefactors Arraigned every month at the Sessions in the Old-bayly, being commonly so numerous, and their Crimes so various, as well as their methods of putting them in practice, so new-invented and unheard-of; It has been thought convenient from time to time to continue the publication of the Transactions there to the world, that the honest securely innocent may for the future be forearm'd by requisite caution and the <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="16760510003"/>ill disposed, warned to leave off and avoid such subtile and mischievous practices.</p>
               <p>The Sessions began on Wednesday the 10th of this Instant May, and though it determined the following evening, yet to relate exactly all the Minute circumstances of the Villanies there unravel'd, would bee too tedious; we shall therefore give onely a brief, yet most true, and plain account of the most material Passages.</p>
