Sir,—I am instructed by Mr. Duncan, of 59, Great George-street, Bermondsey, to apply to the London and North Western Railway Company, for compensation for the injuries sustained by his wife, Mrs. Duncan, and his brother-in-law, Mr. O'Brien, while they were travelling as second class passengers on the Company's railway. On Monday, 4th Sept. last, they were coming from York to London, when at Linsland tunnel, near Leighton Buzzard, a collision of trains took place which caused the injuries alluded to. Mrs. Duncan was at the time pregnant, and in consequence the accident caused her to be con<lb/>fined four months earlier than she would otherwise have been, and its result also was a miscarriage. The shock of the collision caused her to be thrown forward with great violence from her seat to the one opposite, and thus shook and bruised her, that ever since that time she has been ill, attended by a sur<lb/>geon, and almost wholly confined to her bed. Mr. O'Brien, who was in the same carriage with Mrs. Duncan, by the same collision had his knee bruised, and his chest and forehead severely injured; so great was the injury to his lungs that it has caused a spitting of blood ever since. He also has been at tended by a medical gentleman, and like his sister incurred a very heavy medical bill. Yours obediently, John Harrison."</p>

Sir,—The medical gentleman representing the Company having seen Mrs. Duncan and Mr. O'Brien several times, is fully aware of the serious injuries sustained by my wife as well as by Mr. O'Brien; you will no doubt be informed by him that Mrs. Duncan is still very ill, requiring great care, quiet, and nourishment, and in the event of her being again pregnant, it will be attended with great danger. Mr. O'Brien has suffered severely from the injuries to his knee and chest, and is still spitting blood; especially at night, when his cough is very bad, which will prevent him from attending to his business for some time; if he should do so before he is thoroughly well it may bring on a relapse, the consequence of which may be very serious. Under these circumstances, I do hope, that we shall not be compelled to pro<lb/>ceed on an expensive litigation against so powerful a Company, where the means of a private individual would be perhaps entirely wasted, entailing utter ruin upon ourselves and families, who have already suffered severely enough. I am willing to accept 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the injury to Mrs. Duncan, and Mr. O'Brien is willing to accept 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., provided it is settled this week, as Mr. O'Brien has been informed by his solicitor that unless proceedings are issued directly it cannot be tried this term. In the event of this arrangement not being made, Mr. O'Brien wishes it to be tried as soon as possible, and this letter is of course without prejudice in either case, should we be compelled to have recourse to a Court of Law. An early answer will oblige. Yours obediently, R. Duncan."(<hi rend="italic">C</hi>), "Messrs. Barker, Hayes, Barnwell, and Twisden, solicitors, 1, Lincoln-inn-fields. New Inn, 16th Dec, 1848. Gentlemen,—Duncan and O'Brien, and the London and North Western Rail<lb/>way Company. At our last interview I stated to you the willingness of Mrs. Duncan and Mr. O'Brien to make a declaration of the truth of the statement which has already been laid before you relating to the accident they met with on your railway, since then I have had with me Mr. Robert Darke, who is a traveller in the house of Messrs.

               <p>which I think it best to send herewith. Mr. Darke adds, on being questioned by me, that he was coming from York, on 4th Sept., 1848, on his way to London, starting from the former place about five o'clock in the evening, that the accident occurred about three o'clock the next morning. He also states, that Mrs. Duncan was so injured on that occasion as to be obliged to be car<lb/>ried into the station. That before the 4th Sept. last, he knew nothing of Mr. O'Brien or Mrs. Duncan, but at that time he gave to the former his name, and the name of the house in Northumberland-street, Strand, which be used when in London. Mr. Darke states his willingness to make a declaration of the fact he has spoken to. He refers to C. H. Millet, Esq., clerk to Messrs. Hunt, solicitors, 10, Whitehall, who will speak to his respectability. Mr. Darke will be in town again on Thursday, when if you desire it, he will call upon you, and repeat the information which is now supplied you. I need scarcely add, that the parties are very desirous of an early determination of this affair to induce you to give an early attention to it. I am, gentlemen, yours obediently, John Harrison."—(<hi rend="italic">D</hi>)," J. Harrison, Esq., 5, New Inn, Strand. 11, Northumberland-street, Strand, Dec. 15th, 1848. Sir,—Mr. O'Brien having made application to me this morning respecting the accident which took place on the North Western Railway on the 5th Sept., I beg to state that I was present, being one of the passengers on that unfortunate occasion, and that I was in the same carriage with Mr. O'Brien and Mrs. Duncan, (whom I afterwards found to be brother and sister) when the accident took place, and afterwards I saw them on the line, and likewise at Leighton Buz<lb/>zard, and came to town with them. I was very much shook myself, and did not forget it for several days, but having received no particular injury I did not trou<lb/>ble myself about it, nor had I any time, but will not travel by railway again if I can go by any other conveyance. They appeared very much frightened and hurt. I had told Mr. O'Brien that if he wanted me at any time he might depend on me to come forward, if I could do so conveniently, as I considered it a piece of gross negligence somewhere. I will do myself the honour of waiting on you this afternoon at three o'clock, if you wish it, but am leaving town on Saturday. Your obedient servant, R. Darke."</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of John Sinfield, a ship-steward; he is now in China. In Sept. last I lodged at Duncan's house, in George-street, Bermondsey—on 4th Sept. I left some glass at the house, about four in the afternoon—I saw Mrs. Duncan—I was there on the following day; I saw her then, and continued to see her for some time afterwards—I called on 5th, between seven and eight in the evening—I moved in on that day; continued to live in the house, and saw her pretty well every day—I remained there a month—I saw very little of her—she appeared to be well till the last few days—I saw her about the house, doing her duty as mistress of the house day by day—when I saw her on 5th, she was sitting in the kitchen—towards the last few days of the month Mr. Duncan told me that she had been under a surgical operation; that was the first I heard of her illness—she did not give me any account of the illness—I heard nothing about a fall down-stairs, or anything of that sort—I do not know whether any medical man attended her—I cannot say whether she was confined to her bed at all in the early part of the month—I did not see her—I heard that she was confined to her bed for two days—that was on the Thursday before 3d Oct.</p>

                  </hi> I am a letter-carrier, at the Portland-street branch-office. Last Saturday I went on duty about six o'clock—I was in the office at five—I had instructions to watch the prisoner—there were two despatches of letters that evening from the General Post-office, called the six o'clock despatch—the first arrived about five minutes past six, the letters were sorted, and about twenty minutes after a second dispatch arrived—they were sorted, and I left at ten minutes past seven, leaving the prisoner there with the inspector—he had not left the office that evening from the time the first dispatch arrived until he went out with his letters for delivery.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief-clerk at Bow-street police-office. On 10th Jan. Mr. Sellers was brought there, before Mr. Henry, the Magi<lb/>strate, in charge of Grant—there was no name on the charge-sheet at first, and I asked him his name—he said, "l am a clergyman; am I obliged to give it;" the Magistrate said, "You are obliged to give it," and he then gave his name "Rev. Henry Charles Sellers, curate at Send, near Guildford"—the prisoner was then sworn and examined as a witness—I took his statement down, and he signed it—(<hi rend="italic">reads</hi>—"Samuel Cooper, on his oath, saith as follows: I am a private in the second battalion Scotch Fusilier Guards. I was posted as sentry last night, 9th Jan., at the Duchess of Kent's door, in Palace-yard, about half-past ten. I observed the defendant coming towards me, smoking a cigar. He went towards the Milkhouse-gate, leading to the Park, and through one gate and returned immediately by another, and walked by the side of the wall of the Duke of Sutherland's house. He crossed over towards me, and said to me, 'It is a wet night.' I said it was. At this time I was standing under the portico of the Duchess of Kent's house, and he was still smoking. He asked me who I was keeping guard over. I replied, 'The Duchess of Kent.' He said, 'Did you say the Duchess of?' substituting another word. I said, 'No, Sir; the Duchess of Kent.' He immediately caught hold of my private parts as he said those words; and I at the same time seised him by the collar, and took him to the guard-room, where I left him in charge of the sergeant of the guard. At the time he laid hold of me by the private parts he did not say a word to me. On my way with him to the guard-room he said, 'I have done nothing to you.' I said, 'You have, Sir.' I think he was perfectly sober at the time. I had my great-coat on, and the defendant put his hand under it when he seized me by the private parts. I have been twelve years in the regiment, and in the same batallion.'")—Mr. Sellers was called on to find bail to answer the charge at the Sessions, himself in 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and two sureties of 250<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each.</p>

Such a thought as he alleges against me never entered my head. I am completely at the mercy of the man. I utterly deny the charge. I had a cigar in my mouth. I remained some time under the shelter of the portico. I was going as far as Pimlico, but it rained fast, and I stood for shelter under the portico. I stayed there sometime, and then I spoke to the man, and he seized me. I am a clergyman, and curate of Send, near Guildford.'")—I have got the charge-sheet here—when it was brought to me I fancy there was no name on it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I may be mistaken in that—I find here, in my own handwriting, "Send, near Guildford, a clergy<lb/>man"—it is my impression that there was no name, because the name of "Henry Sadler" is in another handwriting—(<hi rend="italic">The charge-sheet being read, the name of "Henry Sadler, Send, near Guildford, clergyman" appeared as the party charged with indecently assaulting the complainant while on duty in the Stable-yard, in the parish of St. James's.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

On the night of 9th Jan. I was on duty at Sir Henry Wheatley's door, which is between the sentinel at the Duchess of Kent's door and the guard-house—about twenty or twenty-five minutes past ten I saw the prisoner pass by where I was posted, close to me, with the gentleman—he had hold of his collar with his left hand, and had his gun in his right—I cannot say whether the bayonet was fixed or not—a man is supposed to have it fixed when he is sentinel—supposing a sentinel wants assistance, it is his duty to call to the next sentinel, and if he is too far off to hear him there are plenty of people passing by—I was near enough to hear him if he had called—if I had heard him call I should have called to the next sentinel, who was at the guard-house door—a sentinel is not allowed, under any circumstances, to leave his post—I left my post that night at about ten minutes to twelve—I then went to the guard-house—the prisoner was there, and said he was very sorry he had had anything to do with taking the gen<lb/>tleman in charge, but the old b—did not offer to <hi rend="italic">spring</hi> up with anything, or be would have let him go; he said it was a pity but what he had been on the Colour-post, or some other post, where there had not been so many people about, when he would have had all the b—lot he had got, money, rings, watch and all—he said it was a beautiful little gold watch, about the size of a half-crown—I said to him, "A watch is a very dangerous thing to have anything to do with"—he said, "Oh, I would have put that out of sight for three or four days; I would have swallowed it"—he stated that the gentleman had refused to give his name when he got to the station, but he gave it after a time, and he said what he saw taken from him—that he would not give it up, but it was taken from him by force—he said he saw some notes, gold, silver, a half-mourning ring, and a watch—that was all I heard him say—I was tired and went and laid down.</p>

                  </hi> I am a private in the same battalion and company that the prisoner belonged to—I was at the guard-house on the night of 9th Jan.—the prisoner was there—I came in that night off sentry about ten minutes past twelve—the prisoner said he had given a gentleman in charge that night, who had given up some notes, gold, and silver, and a watch, and if he had been on the Colour-post he would have had the lot—in the barrack-room, a few days after, he stated if he had got a sovereign, Mr. Sellers might have gone to hell—when he has come off duty I have heard him say that he has got money from people; he did not say how he got it—I heard him say so as many as three times, and when he has come off duty I have seen him with silver.</p>

                  </hi> I am porter to Mr. William Barker and another, twine-manufacturers, 59, Watling-street. On Thursday night, 8th Feb., at half-past six o'clock, I had occasion to take a letter two doors off—when I went out I saw a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at the door of my master's warehouse—there were three men with it; Smith was one of them—they were lifting a bale on the box of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw Callingham, but I did not take so much notice of him as I did of the other—they were all lifting the bale—I did not tee any one enter the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw Smith open the <hi rend="italic">cab-door</hi>, and I saw him shot it—he then ran round behind the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, ran past it, and up towards St. Paul's, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> followed him—(I had seen the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man run round on the off-side and get on the box)—I know the bale—I observed the mark on it as they lifted it up—when I got into the warehouse, John Clarbour spoke to me about the bale, and, in consequence of what he said, 1 went after the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I saw it run along Watling-street—I was some distance behind it—I chased it till I got to St. Paul's Church-yard, and there saw it draw up to the side of the pave<lb/>ment, and Smith got on it: he sat on the seat, with his legs across the bale, which was outside—I chased them down Ludgate-hill—I called out, "Stop that <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>," and "Stop thief!"—I should think the driver could not have heard it, I was too far behind—I lost sight of it in Blackfriars-road—I saw a policeman running very hastily after it.</p>

                  </hi> I was at the Anchor—a quarrel took place between Rumball and Hunt; Rumball began it—he used some irritating language and struck Hunt with his elbow, and provoked him to fight—after they bad struck at each other, they closed and fell down, Rumball undermost, with his shoulder across the fender—he got up without assistance—I told Hunt he had better not get fighting with his mate—he said, "Well, I wont fight him, for he does not know how to hit again"—Rumball was tipsy—he still tried to provoke Hunt; calling him a coward, and laughing and jeering at him—he did not appear injured by the fall—the prisoners were in the room at this time, but had not interfered—about twenty minutes after the quarrel with Hunt, Hunton got into the middle of the room and said, "You struck my father, now here is his boy that will <hi rend="italic">whack</hi> you"—his father-in-law was in the room—the deceased then said, "Oh, very well, "and began to take his clothes off—they both took off their frocks and waistcoats—Parrott stood by Hunton as his second, and he said, "Go in <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, and hit from your shoul<lb/>der"—I saw Hunton strike Rumball in the face, somewhere between the cheek and neck, with great force—it caused him to fall into a sitting position, and in a moment or two after he slid sideways off the form on to the ground—he never spoke a word from the time he was struck—I saw as he was raised that his face was of a bluish colour, and said he was either dead or dying<lb/>he was carried out, and I believe he died before he was got out.</p>

I was called to the deceased, and saw him outside the Anchor, supported by several persons—he was quite dead—next day, in company with Mr. King, a dresser at the London Hospital, I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—the cause of death was extravasation of blood on the brain, caused by some external violence—I found a slight abrasion on the forehead, and at the back of the head was a large <hi rend="italic">ecchymosis</hi>, and a quantity of extravasated blood escaped from that part; that injury, I think, was done by a blow—it is my decided opinion that the first blow caused the mischief, and the. second caused the death—I found clotted blood, with effusion in the ventricles of the brain, and I believe that arose from the injury at the back of the head.</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, at 4, High-street, Bloomsbury. I saw the deceased about half-past eight o'clock in the morning—she was quite dead, and was not cold—by the order of the Coroner I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination, and found a rupture of a blood-vessel on the brain, which was the cause of death; the brain was in a very diseased state, and there had been previous inflammation, and old adhesions were left—there was no disease in any other part of the body to account for death—there were no marks of kicks or blows about the body, or any external violence—if there had been such external violence as to occasion death there roust have been some indi<lb/>cations of it—the rupture of this blood-vessel was such as might have been produced by violence—I found the brain completely distended with blood, and the vessels in such a fragile state, that a shake or fall would produce the rupture that caused death; a fall would do it—I am certain it was not a kick that did it, or I must have found the mark of it—if a man had thrown her on the ground, and the vessel had been immediately ruptured, there would have been no external indication—the brain was in that state, that a <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> or fall from pulling a chair away would have caused death—there would then be no external indication; it was as similar to apoplexy as possible—there would be no time for discolouration—it was in the ventricles, the most important part of the brain, where the blood was effused—I can distinguish between a blow given before and after death—there would be no marks if the blow was given after death.</p>

                  </hi> The prisoner is my husband, he is a clockmaker, we live in Compton-street, Clerkenwell, and have been married twenty years. On 26th Jan. I was out with him and my son John—we had been to a friend's house, and had some bread and cheese and a pot of ale and a pot of porter between five of us—we were all sober—in coming home he walked very fast, and was quarrel some, and struck my son, and said he would strike me, but did not—we got to our door about a quarter to one—he said, "D—your eyes, neither of you shall enter these doors to-night"—my son was in the road—the prisoner took the pendulum of a clock from his side and struck me on the head with it—it cut through my bonnet and cut my head—I went to the station, and had it dressed—it is nearly well now.</p>

                  </hi> I am a member and secretary of the Beehive Loan Society, held at the Beehive, Somers-town; there are twelve proprietors; Titus Turk is one. On 14th Nov, Painter came and gave me this proposal for a loan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is on a printed form of the Society's—(<hi rend="italic">This was a proposal for a loan of</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">for twelve months, by Henry Francis, of</hi> 10, <hi rend="italic">Charles-street, Clarendon-square, on the security of William Davis</hi>, 33, <hi rend="italic">Little George-street, Hampstead-road</hi>)—we charge 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for making inquiries; Painter paid that—on the 16th I went to 33, Little George-street, Hempstead-road, saw the prisoner Davis, and said, I called respecting an application for some money by a party named Henry Francis, residing at 10, Charles-street, Clarendon<lb/>square—he said that party had applied to him to become security, and he had consented—I asked if he knew the man—he said he had worked in the same establishment, Sir Henry Meux's, ten or twelve years—I asked if he</p>

               <p>was justified in putting himself in such a position, whether he thought himself safe—he said he was perfectly satisfied—I asked what the money was required for—he said it was to complete the furnishing of his house—I said I was not prepared to give an answer then, but he could come on Friday—on the Friday afternoon I saw both prisoners at the Beehive<lb/>Painter spoke to me first, and said, "My name is Francis: I have called respecting an application I made last Tuesday for five guineas"—Davis was at his elbow—I said, "You were not at home when I cslled"—he said, "I was at the brewery" (I had called at 10, Charles-street, Clarendon-square)—I said, "Is your security here?"—he said, "Yes, this is Mr. Davis'—I said to Davis, "Is this Mr. Francis, of Charles-street, your fellow-servant?"—he said, "Yes"—I read the form to them, prepared this note, and said to Painter, "Write your Christian and surname, and address, in full"—I saw him write "Henry Francis, 10, Charles-street, Clarendon-square"—I then gave it to Davis, and he signed, "William Davis, 33, Little George-street, Hampstesd-road—I sent then to Mr. Knight, and saw him pay them 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the interest was five per cent.; the book of rules," and the stamp 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—(<hi rend="italic">the bill was dated Nov.</hi> 17, 1848, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., <hi rend="italic">payable on demand to Titus Turk, on order</hi>)—I was present on 13th Feb., when Davis was taken—Mr. Francis, of 10, Charles-street, was there—Davis said, "I signed for Francis, but not for this Francis."</p>

                  </hi> I live at 13, Stamford Villas, in the parish of Fulham. On Friday night, 9th Feb., I went to bed about ten o'clock—between two and three I was awoke by my wife, who heard footsteps on the stairs—I immediately jumped out of bed, and asked who was there, but I received no answer—I then opened my bed-room door, and saw a man standing on the landing, very near the bed-room door—I said, "What do you want?"—he answered, "Here he is, "or" Here is the dog"—he had a lantern in his right hand—I immediately received a blow on the top of the head, which broke a vein, and it immediately bled very considerably, and caused a violent bruise—I did not see what I was struck with—I was not able to attend at the police-court for a fortnight in consequence of the injury—I did not distinctly see who it was that struck me, I was so alarmed, and the blood was flowing from my head, I retreated into my bed-room as quick as I could, fearful the man might follow me—my wife got out of bed, and assisted me to close the door—she then threw up the window and called the police, and I sprung a rattle</p>

                  </hi> I am servant to Mr. Waller. I was the last up on Friday night, 9th Feb.—before I went to bed I particularly examined all the windows and doors, and they were perfectly secure—there was no whole in the wall—I was awoke shortly before three o'clock by a bell ringing, and I heard a scuffling or confused noise on the stairs—I do not think there was more than one person going down stairs, but I cannot say—I looked out at the window, and saw a man running down the garden as fast as he could, with a lantern in his hand, apparently making his escape—when I first saw him, he was about eight or ten yards from the house—he leaped over the wall, at the bottom of the garden, and I lost sight of him—from what I saw of him I believe it to be Cullum—I heard other men's voices, but only saw him—I should say there were two or three men; that was after I saw the man get over the wall—I afterwards examined the premises, and missed two silver spoons, which I had seen just before I went to bed—next morning I received a piece of a knife from Snell, which I wrapped in a piece of paper, and afterwards gave it back to him the same day.</p>

I went to the house on Saturday morning, about five o'clock, and found a square of glass broken in the water<lb/>closet window, and the window open—I found marks of a crow-bar, and of a knife, on the inside of the water-closet door—I found a square of glass broken in the kitchen-window, and several marks of a crow-bar near the hinges on the shutter—the hinges were nearly forced off—I next examined a small place used for cleaning knives and shoes; a square of glass was broken in the window, and the window was open; no entry had been made that way—I found the tool-house door forced off the hinges, and set on one side—there was then a hole through the brick-work into the kitchen, large enough to admit a man—I picked up this crow-bar—the kitchen-drawers had been disturbed, and some linen removed—I went up and saw Mr. Waller in bed; he had a wound on his head—a quantity of blood was on his shirt, and in different parts of the room—I saw footmarks on the mould—next day I went to the Pimlico-station and saw the prisoners—I took off these shoes from Cullum and Pike (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and compared them with the footmarks, by making an impression at the side of the marks—they corresponded in every respect—these are Cullum's shoes—the right-foot is worn, and has given way to the sole—there is only half a tip on the heel—on the left here are a few nails on the toe, which left an impression; the toe was the deepest part—there is nothing peculiar about Pike's shoes—the impression was not distinct enough to show this impression on the side—I had noticed on the Saturday that one footmark had only half a heel—I received this knife from sergeant Matthews, in Digby's presence, and this point of a knife from Snell on Saturday afternoon; they fit one another exactly.</p>

                  </hi> I live in Castle-street, Falcon-square. I know the prisoner—I first had transactions with him about the middle of Oct.—he obtained one customer for me for some cloth—on 25th Oct. I had a case of gloves, containing 110 dozens of different sizes and qualities, sent to me direct from Paris; they were done up in dozens, and were in cartoons—the prisoner said he thought he could dispose of the whole to a friend, or a relation of his, in Regent street, who were large buyers—he mentioned the name of Ablett and Wheeler, and asked me whether I would allow him to take samples of the lot, to show to that house—I said I should take till next day to consider—he called next day—I said I had looked up eighteen dozen, of different qualities, which would be a fair representation of the 110—I gave him the price they were to be offered at—he was to bring them back in the afternoon, and tell me what he had done—he did not come back—on 2d Nov., about a week afterwards, I met him in the street—his eye caught me, and he apparently wished to avoid me, but we came in contact; he appeared very much embarrassed—I said, "Where are my gloves?"—he said, "I have been extremely ill, laid up; I could not come to you"—I said, "Where are the gloves?"—he said, "They are at Ablett and Wheeler's, for ap<lb/>proyal"—I said I had sold the lot; I must have them returned immediately—I added, further, I had sent them to Birmingham, and I must have them that evening to sell the lot—he said, "I will go instantly, and fetch them"—before</p>

               <p>he went I asked him for his address, and he gave me a false address, 14, Bartholomew-close—I was not able to find anything of him there; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> went to every house there—he turned off from me, in the direction of Regent-street—he did not come back with the gloves that evening—on the evening of 9th Nov. he called at my house, in my absence, and saw my wife—I found that ten dozen of those gloves that had been sent, bad been left at my house; they were rumpled and creased terribly, as though they had been in pawn—they were not in a condition in which I could sell them at the same price as the others—on 10th Nov. I met the prisoner in Falcon-street—I told him to come back to my house, and when I got him inside I said, "Now, where are my gloves? you have brought back ten dozen; where are the eight dozen?"—(the eight dozen were worth about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the others were in about the same ratio)—he said first he had lost them—I said, "I have just come from the police-office, in Scotland-yard; I intend to give you into custody"—he begged and prayed of me not to do <hi rend="italic">to</hi>—he then said he had left them at the bar of a public-house—I wanted to know the public-house, or whereabouts it was, but he could not tell me—he said this was his first offence; that his character had never been tarnished before, and it would blast his reputation if I exposed him; that he would restore them if I would give him time—I told him he had given me a false address—he said he could not account for that—I asked where his lodgings were—he told me, and I went there with him; it was in Charterhouse-lane—he remained outside—I went in, and made inquiries—I found that he lived there, but said that I was not satisfied with what I beard from his landlady, it appeared that his illness was constant drunkenness—he said he would restore the gloves, if I would allow him to do so, and not give him in charge—he did not tell me that he had sold them at an inferior price, and in a wrong name.</p>

Petley said, "It is mine"—I found under it a stone-bottle of strong rum—I asked if they knew anything of it? they said, "No;" Lewis said he came down with the barge, and never left her, and that they had been asleep—I took them to the station, and left Wall there with Bargi-nall—I found this shipping-note on Petley (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I went back and asked Wall what he did in the barge—he said he was ordered by Mr. Pope to take some papers to the watchman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">policeman, N</hi> 387). About half-past seven o'clock in the evening, on 14th Feb., I was in the Green-lanes, Stoke Newington, about sixteen yards from the gate leading to Mr. Webb's brick-field; it was dusk, but not very dark; there was a gas-lamp at the gateway—I observed a omit about 100 yards from the gateway—the prisoner Jones was in it—I knew him before—a few minutes afterwards I saw Melliship standing by the gate, and in a short time I saw Nash, who is Mr. Webb's carter, and Hewitson—I know Hewitson; he is a coal-merchant—they came up the read, in a direction from Mr. Webb's stable—Hewitson had this sack about three parts full—he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184902260116"/>
               <p>to the gateway, and went just inside—(when I first saw him he was twenty or thirty yards from the gate)—he had a word or two with Melliship, and then Melliship went towards the cart—Jones came back driving the horse, and Melliship walked at the side—Hewitson was still inside the gate—when the cart came opposite the gateway, Hewitson put the bag over the rails on the ground—Melliship took it up, threw it into the cart, and immediately jumped in, and went on with it—Hewitson came out of the gate, passed under the lamp, walked for twenty or thirty yards the same way as the cart was going, and then jumped up into the cart himself—the cart was then going slowly, when he got in, it went off at a smartish trot—I ran after it—when it got within a few yards of Hewitson's house, in King Henry street, in the Back-road, Hewitson jumped out; at the same time Melliship jumped out, and ran into Hewitson's stable-door, which is between where the cart stopped and Hewitson's house—Melliship threw open the folding-door—Jones drove the cart on, and as the horse's nose was going into the stable I caught the horse's head, and in the cart I saw the sack with the corn in it—I took Jones, and my brother officer took Melliship—I told Jones I should take him to the station—he said, "Well, why should I go? fetch my master, I he knows all about it; he brought the cart down the lane; I have only just got into it"—we put Melliship into the cart, and all went to the station-Melliship said he had only just got up, and he bad been cleaning a horse is the stable—I found Hewitson's name on the cart—as we passed by Hewitson's door, we stopped, and Hewitson came out—he had then got his jacket and cap off, and he had a towel in his hand, as though he were washing himself; that was about seven or eight minutes after I saw him jump out of the cart—he wanted to know what was the matter—I said, "You had stolen property in your cart"—he said he did not know that his horse and cart was out of the place—my brother officer said, "You had stolen property in your cart, and you know all about it"—he made no answer—we took the others to the station, and then came back and took Hewitson.</p>

I marked a half-sovereign and a sixpence, in the presence of Mr. Cole, and folded them in this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I did not turn down the ends, I put it in the inner-fold of this letter, put the whole into this cover, sealed, and addressed it to Thomas Jefferies, Mickley. near Ripon, Yorkshire, and gave it to Peak, with instructions—if posted at Deptford or New-cross, before four o'clock that afternoon, it would arrive in London about ten minutes to six—I was at the office when the Deptford mail-bag arrived—I looked for the letter; it was not in the bag—I went with Cole, Peak, and Russell, to the Deptford post-office; we got there about seven—Cole and Russell parted from me—I followed shortly afterwards, and found them at the prisoner's house, in a street leading out of Pomeroy-street, and found him there—Mr. Cole said in his presence, "We have found the money and the letter"—the money was produced—I examined it, and found my marks on it—Peak then produced the letter—I examined it, and said to the prisoner," How do you account for this? this is my money"—he said the money must have shaken out of the letter; when he called at New-cross for the collection he put it properly into his pouch, and going to the office a man gave him a ride in his cart, and the cart having no springs it must have jolted the money out of the letter—I then said, "Why did not you give it to the charge-taker at Deptford, when you gave in your collection?"—he said, "I did not discover it in my pouch until after I left the office"—I gave him in charge—the office at New-cross is a mile or more from the post-office at Deptford, where he would have to carry the letters—there is a charge-taker there, to whom it would be his duty to deliver his letters—I believe New-cross was the only place where he would have to call—to the best of my belief I found the letter folded the reverse way—I put the money in the inner fold—it was not there when shown to me; the cover was torn, as now, and part of the wax broken away.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter-carriers to the London dis<lb/>trict. I was present and saw Mr. Sculthorpe put half-a-sovereign and six-pence in a letter—I saw them marked—these are the same—the envelope was folded in this way—the coin was in this card, which was in the inner fold of the paper—on the same day, a little after seven o'clock, I went with Russell, the policeman, to the prisoner's-house, 4, Alfred-place, Pomeroy-street, Kent-road—we saw the prisoner—I asked if he knew me—he said, "No"—I said I was inspector of letter-carriers, and the person with me was the police-con<lb/>stable from the office, and asked him if he was on duty at the Deptford-office when the five o'clock bag was made up for London—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he made up the bag—he said, "No", I only counted some of the letters"—I said there were two letters posted before four o'clock that ought to have arrived in that bag, but had not, and asked if he knew anything about them—he said, "No"—I said as one of them was posted at New-cross, where he collected, had he any objection to be searched—he said, "No"—I asked what money he had—he put both his hands into his trowsers pockets and took from the left pocket half-a-sovereign and sixpence, and from the other he put on the table 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I took up the half-sovereign and sixpence, examined them, and said, "This is Mr. Sculthorpe's money"—I examined two sixpences before I found the right—the second was the one that had accompanied the half-sovereign—he said, "That I found in my pouch; it shook out of a letter on my way to the office"—I said, "Where is the letter?"—he was about to put his hand into his pocket—I stopped him, and told Russell to search him, who took the letter produced from his breast coat-pocket with the seal broken as it is now—I did not take the letter out of the envelope till Mr. Sculthorpe came—it was then in the same state—I told Mr. Sculthorpe, loud enough to be heard in the room, that I had found the money and letter—the prisoner was taken to the Deptford post-office—he was asked where he put his pouch—he got up from his seat and showed me behind the door in the office, and took it off the hook—he said he had not been at the office from the time of having been with his letters until he was brought back by me—I took the letter out of the enve<lb/>lope at the post-office, and found the card in the inner fold, in the other leaf of the sheet, quite contrary to where it had been placed by Mr. Sculthorpe—it was on the reverse side, showing only the white of the paper, instead of the writing—if the prisoner had found any letter in his pouch from which money had escaped, it would be his duty, when he arrived at Deptford, to give it to the charge-taker.</p>

               <p>think it is more strong than the other—red or common black wax is much more likely to break than this; this is much purer—the half-sovereign, six-pence, and card would not be a heavy weight for this envelope—if the money came out of the envelope, it must in the first instance have come out inside the note, and then, if this piece of blue sealing-wax was to give way, it would almost necessarily fall out, if it was a single letter—I did not tell the prisoner when I went to his house that he was suspected of taking or stealing a letter, or that what he said might be urged in a Criminal Court against him—I went on with the investigation without any warning to him—I received instructions from my superior officer, Mr. Sculthorpe—he gave me no specified instruct<lb/>tions—I have several times gone into people's houses without giving them warning—the officer took away some articles, and among them a silver watch and some money—I did not direct him to take it—it has not been restored—it is in my possession now—the officer gave it me the same evening—I heard the prisoner say to Mr. Sculthorpe, "The money shook out of a letter on my way to the office, as I rode in a cart that had no springs"—I did not hear him say he believed the letter had broken away from the string, and shaken out into his pouch from the jolting.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Albion-hotel, opposite the Lower Dock-yard-gates, at Woolwich.

               <p>money was gone—I had information of the lots about eleven in the evening, and on going up to my room, found the door open; the lock had been picked, and all the drawers as well—I missed all the money—the prisoner was at my house that night, about half-past five or six—he came by himself—I had seen him once, about a fortnight before—he then asked me if I knew Mr. Davis, a builder, I said I did—he said he owed him a bill of 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and asked me if I thought there was any hopes of his getting it—I told him I thought his bill was not worth much, for I knew the man was in difficulties—he said, "Dear me, here is trouble for me, I dare not go home and tell my wife of it; the anxieties of mind that persons in business have no one knows but those who experience it; a man getting his 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 24<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, has much less anxiety than a man in business, and is better off"—when be came on 10th Jan., he appeared to have his arm in a sling—he called for 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of brandy, and a little cold water, and asked me how I had been this Christmas—he said he had been very unfortunate since he saw me last, that he went out on New-year's night to spend the evening with a few friends, and had drank too freely of wine, and driving home in his gig, he fell out and injured his arm—I think it was his right-arm that he had in a sling—he said, "By-the-bye, I hear Dennis is an insolvent; do you think I shall get 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound?"—I said, "I really do not know the position of the man, whether he can pay 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.;" this conversation was at the bar—I went into the bar-parlour to get my tea—I am a widower, and have a little girl, who was out to tea that evening; I told my house-keeper that I would go and fetch her, and as I went out I saw a man named Lawrence, who has since been transported, in the act of coming in—he said, "Landlord, are you going out?" I said, "I am," on my return, about nine, the prisoner and Lawrence were both gone—I pre<lb/>ferred a bill against Lawrence, and a man named Chappell; they were tried here, and transported for another offence, and his Lordship did not think it necessary to try my case (<hi rend="italic">see Vol</hi>, 28, p. 659.)—when the prisoner was at my house a fortnight before the robbery, he came alone; but Lawrence and another man were at the bar at the time, though they did not appear to know each other, and Chappell was seen <hi rend="italic">dodging</hi> in and out the door—Lawrence on that occasion asked me for change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note, as he did hot like to get it changed at a turnpike; the prisoner was there at the time—I asked Law<lb/>rence his address, and he said, "9, Borough-road"—I went up the stairs from the bar, and got change for the note from where my money was taken, and one of the notes afterwards taken was that note—I had to go up two flights of stairs—the policeman has since shown me a cash-box, which is mine, and was in one of my drawers—I did not see the prisoner from the 10th Jan., 1848, till I identified him at the police-court last Saturday fortnight, he was then standing among about forty persons in the Court, and I picked him out; the Magistrate would not allow him to be put in the box, but had him stand<lb/>ing among the people in Court—I had previously identified Lawrence—on 10th Jan., there was another man with Lawrence at the bar, about two minutes before the pri-soner came in—I did not myself see Chappell—the pri<lb/>soner came in about two minutes after them; he did not appear to know them.</p>

                  </hi>. I belong to Woolwich dockyard. On the evening of the 10th Jan., 1848, about ten minutes to six o'clock, I was at Mr. Covil's, with Mr. Milrose, and Mr. Marrow in room No. 2—there were two other persons in the room, strangers to me—one of them who had his back to me went out of the room, leaving the other there, and returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and made an observation to the other, in consequence of which they both went away together—I went in at about twenty minutes to six, and remained at the bar drinking a glass of whiskey—our business occupied a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and we left about twenty minutes or half-past six—we went into No. 2, about six—I did not see the mens' faces sufficient to recognise them—Milrose and Marrow are not here—we are in the eapacity of leading men in the dockyard.</p>

                  </hi> In Jan., 1848, I was servant to Mr. Covill—I remember the robbery—I remember the prisoner quite well, and Chappell and Lawrence who have been tried—the prisoner came in between half-past five and six o'clock—Chappell and Lawrence were at the bar then, and another person whom I have never seen since—Chappell went in and out several times—when I first saw the prisoner he was standing at the bar with his arm on the engine talking to Mr. Covill—I did not see him come in—in consequence of what Mrs. Graves said to me about six, I showed the prisoner into No. 2 room—I took up a light, and he ordered sixpenny worth of brandy and water—he took up with him pen and ink, and a sheet of paper—he did not at any time call for any wafers, or sealing-wax—when he first went in there I was no one there—I did not see him leave—I went up in about half or three quarters of an hour to put out the light, and he was then gone—Mr. Weston, Mr. Milrose, and Mr. Marrow, who are old customers, were there—when I took up the brandy and water the prisoner was not writing—he was sitting in a chair close by the fire—some time after this I went to the Lambeth police-court, saw Lawrence and Chappell there, and picked out Chappell from about forty or fifty people—they were two of the persons I had seen on the night of the robbery—I knew my master kept his money in the drawers in his room—I had been up-stairs about four that afternoon—I locked the door of Mr. Covill's room, and put the key into my pocket—there are two keys, Mr. Covill has one, and I the other—the drawers were then undisturbed, and as they should be—I first saw the prisoner after the robbery in the ante-room at the Greenwich police-court—he was just going through—I happened to look up and knew him directly—I found the bed-room door open about seven—I acquainted Mrs. Graves the housekeeper with it—the other rooms on the same floor as No. 2 are private, and were kept locked—I noticed that the three men had on each a shawl handkerchief alike.</p>

                  </hi> I am housekeeper to Mr. Covill. I know the prisoner—he was there twice on the night of 10th Jan., 1848—he first came in alone, about half-past seven o'clock, shortly after the two others—he did not appear to recognise them; he was about three feet from them—that was about half-past five—he asked for threepennyworth of brandy and water—when he came in the second time, he asked for a pen and ink, which Mr. Covill's son gave him—I desired Brooks to get a light, and she went up-stairs with him to No. 2—I recognised Chappell and Lawrence, and was at their trial—after the pri<lb/>soner called for a pen and paper, they stood at the bar in conversation with me—the prisoner went up-stairs, leaving them there without recognising them—they had some brandy and water, and it was either too hot or too cold—I had to go into the bar-parlour to get the hot water—I was engaged</p>

               <p>in attending to them, and altering the brandy and water, for some time<lb/>that would give them an opportunity of being out of my sight—they might have gone from the bar without my observing them—I should say they were about twenty minutes drinking the brandy and water—they went away about half-past six, or a little later, bidding me good night—I had seen them all three at the bar at the same time about a fortnight before—they did not appear to know or recognise each other then—I never saw Chappell and Lawrence except at our house—I saw them on a third occassion before the Magistrate—I remember Mr. Covill giving one of them change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and the note was rather old—he went up-stairs for the change into his own room—that was the first time they were there—they were all standing at the bar at the time—that would not enable them to see the bed-room unless there was any one outside watching, then they could see, because the bed-room is in front of the house.</p>

In Dec. 1847, between five and six in the evening, four persons came to my house in a gig—the prisoner is one of them, I have no doubt about it, and Chappell and Lawrence were two of the others—one of them wanted change for a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.-note—they did not stay more than a quarter of an hour—they had 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.-worth of brandy and water—on 10th Jan. 1848, about four o'clock, four men came to my house in a gig—they were Lawrence, Chappell, the prisoner, and another whom I do not know—by the direction of Lawrence the chaise was left in front of the house; the shafts turned up and the horse put into our stable—they came into the parlour for half an hour, and took two sixpenny worths of brandy and water—they went away on foot, and the chaise was left at my house—they were away about three hours, at the end of which time two of them came back; I believe Lawrence was one, and the other was the one who I do not know—they ordered me to put the horse too, which I did; they bid me good night and drove away—they came back twice, and finally left about eight o'clock, and I saw no more of them—neither of them had his arm in a sling—when I saw the prisoner at the police-court I knew him directly.</p>

I was sent for to Mr. Whitear's—I found the prisoner there; she was drunk—I saw her pocket was bulky—I found in it twenty-two duplicates, two relating to silver spoons—I took her to the station, and went to the pawnbroker's, and got these two spoons—the pawnbroker is not here; he went before the Magistrate, and the prisoner then said she pawned them intending to redeem them again.</p>

On Thursday morning, 22d Feb., I was watching—the luggage-train had just arrived from Southampton—on one of the tracks was a wagon loaded with fish—over the wagon was a tarpaulin belonging to the Company, and under that was a covering of white calico nailed down tight all round—I got up and examined it—I kept my eye on the wagon till it arrived where these things are unloaded—I then got into a gentleman's phaeton; but thinking I might be seen, I got out—the phaeton was then quite empty—soon after that, the prisoner and three other men came to this phaeton—after that two of the men went away, leaving Brumwell and the prisoner at work—the prisoner asked Brumwell something, and he went away, leaving the prisoner at the head of the wagon containing the fish—in two or three moments the prisoner left the wagon, and came to the phaeton, and I heard a rustling, a lift up of the apron, and then something dropped—the prisoner turned to the wagon, then came to the phaeton, and 1 heard something drop a second time—he was walking away; I called him, and went to the phaeton with a light which I had, and found five mackerel—I asked him if he knew anything about these</p>

                  </hi> I am the son of William Leigh Wood, a coal-merchant, of Putney; the prisoner has been five years in his employ. On the afternoon of 26th Feb., I sent him with three tons of coals—he was to take one ton to Mr. Grant and two tons to Mr. Clark—I gave him tickets for the delivery of them—I saw thirty sacks in the wagon—I told him, after he had shot the ton at Mr. Grant's, to come back and take some sand with him—he came back and left the wagon outside the gate while he came down for the sand—while the wagon was there, I took the ten sacks out of the wagon which he had shot—he then went away with Mr. Clark's two tons of coals—he came back in the evening—about two hours afterwards the constable came, and the prisoner was taken into custody—I spoke to the prisoner about a sack of coals—he said he had it given to him, and had given it away—I went with the officer and the weighing-machine to Mr. Clark's—I weighed the coals there, and there were nineteen sacks.</p>
