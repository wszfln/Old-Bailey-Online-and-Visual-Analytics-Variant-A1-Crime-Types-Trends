The prisoner brought in a sack of salt, and asked me leave to set it down in the tap-room; I said, there was not room there, but he might carry it backwards, which he did. He desired I'd let it be there till he call'd again. (The empty sack produced.) This is the same sack.</p>

I went near, and saw the prisoner put his head out, and set out a glass bottle, and go back again. He came again with more, and also some pipe staves. Then I went to acquaint the next witness

I got up and went to the prisoner's lodgings, where he was sitting with some beer by him, and a woman drinking. I talked it, and believ'd it to be our beer.

Between the powder mills and the eleven mile stone I saw the prisoner at a distance coming towards me. I was on the north side the road coming towards London, and he on the south going from London. He had a handkerchief tied about his head, which hung on one side of his cheek, but did not cover his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a perfect view of his face?</p>
               <p>Dyer. I had. It was a very clear afternoon, as bright as most days in that season of the year. When he came almost opposite me he stop'd. He had a great coat on, that almost cover'd all his other apparel, out of which he pull'd a pistol. He held it up to the side of my head and said, Sir, your money. I gave him what little matter I had, which was about twenty pence; I know it was under two shillings. He palm'd the money in his hand, and said, Sir, this is not all, or to that purpose. I told him it was. Said he it is very little; Then I thought he seem'd inclined to let me go,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080004"/> or to return it me again. After some time he said, Sir, your watch. I told him I had none. Then he called his maker to witness, and said I had, that he saw it, and if I would not deliver it he'd blow my brains out, and put the pistol up to my head. I said then you shall have it, and gave it him. Then we parted. He went towards Belsont, and I towards Hounslow. I saw him for some time at a distance from me, as he rode along.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again?</p>
               <p>Dyer. I saw him after that in the New-gaol, Surry, about three weeks after. I knew him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go there to see him?</p>
               <p>Dyer. Justice Clark had advertised a person taken with a watch, &amp;c. so I went to the justice and he sent me to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any hint given you which was the person when you came there?</p>
               <p>Dyer. No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him there?</p>
               <p>Dyer. I said nothing to him at all. He had my watch upon him when taken, which I swore to.</p>

               <p>Mungo Barnes. I live in Great Peter-Street, Westminster. I lost my hat out of my shop. The prisoner was suspected, and charged with taking it. He confessed he left his own hat backwards, and carried mine out, and went and pawn'd it for half a crown.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkins. The prisoner brought a hat to pawn to me on the 19th of November, and I lent him half a crown upon it. Since that two men came, and told me the prisoner was in the Savoy for desertion, and he had sent them to my house for some goods which he had pawned. They mentioned two shirts, a handkerchief and a hat. They took out the shirt and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Wilkins. This was on the 23d. After that Mungo Barnes's wife came, and demanded the hat, and said it was her son's hat, and that the prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080005"/> was her son; but never said the hat was stolen. I shew'd her the hat. She went away, and after that these two men came again for the hat, and had it out</p>

               <p>R. Barnes. I did; it was the same hat my husband had lost. The next day I went for it, but he would not shew it me.</p>

            . I confined the prisoner in the Savoy as a deserter, and he confessed to me the hat was pawn'd to this Wilkin s. I went there with Mrs. Barnes, and after some difficulty Wilkins's wife did shew it to us. I would not let her take it out, but gave the pawnbroker particular orders not to deliver the hat to any body till we came again the next day. Then I intended to take it with a search warrant, without paying for it. We went with a search warrant. Said Wilkins, have you brought the money. Said the constable, I have something as good as money, and shew'd him the warrant. He gave the constable a punch on the breast, and knock'd him backwards, and in the mean while he ran in, and I suppose concealed the hat, for that was not to be found, although he had ask'd for the money just before.</p>

               <p>I went to Mungo Barnes's to be taken measure of for a pair of shoes, and they desired me to help them to remove some goods; they got fuddled, and got me to go and pawn the hat for them, and after that they said they would give me half a crown to fetch it out again. I was taken up for desertion or I had fetch'd it again. I never sent any person for the hat at all.</p>

            . On the 30th of September last three men came into my house, when one wanted to go backwards, and I shew'd him the way. The other two went into a room and called for a tankard of beer. The other man staying backwards so long I went to see what he was at. He was looking into my window, and seemingly doing up his breeches. I found every thing safe in my kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner either of these three men?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. He was one of the two that called for the tankard of beer, which they had drawn in a silver quart mug.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come in?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. I believe it was between eight and nine at night. The other came in, and sat in the same box along with them, and call'd for a pint of beer. He drank as if he did not belong to them. He paid me for it, and went out, and in about ten minutes came in again, and sat in the same place where he had before. He called for another pint of beer, and desired I'd put it into their tankard. I said it would not hold it. I put some in, and left the other in the pint pot. I was call'd to go into the cellar to tap a butt of beer, and they all three went away together.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time was this?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. This was about ten o'clock. In going out in haste one of them left this hat ( producing a man's hat) I stumbled over it as it lay in the passage between the two doors. I immediately saw I had lost my tankard, and went to the door to see, but they were gone off.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner to be taken up?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. There was an advertisement in the paper of a man's being taken up, and any person that had lost a silver tankard might apply to justice Fielding; upon which I went (that was on the 4th of this instant) and there I saw the prisoner. He ask'd me if I knew him.</p>

               <p>Q. What was your answer?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. I said, why do you ask? do you know me?</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you out of the room when you went to tap the vessel ?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. I was not gone ten minutes before they and the mug were gone. I had a mistrust of them before I went down, by hearing them say as I passed by them, ''If we an't him to-night we'll have him another night;'' from which I imagined<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080006"/> they were three baliffs, or somebody no better than they should be.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man ever at your house before?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. No, never to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pay their reckoning?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in irons when you saw him at justice Fielding's?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. Yes, he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he pointed out to you as a person suspected ?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. No, he was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Of your own knowledge did you know him?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. Of my own knowledge I knew his face and person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you point him out?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. He pointed me out, for he asked me the first question.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your answer?</p>
               <p>M. Pratt. I asked him again if he knew me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not declare that you did not know him?</p>

               <p>C. Mowet. I am sure he is one of the three. They had two tankards and a pint of beer. I was in the room almost every moment.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a mug was it?</p>
               <p>C. Mowet. It was a quart silver mug.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them go away?</p>
               <p>C. Mowet. No, that was all the time I was out of the room, being with my mistress helping to tap a butt of beer. We made what haste we could. She said, she was afraid something would be lost, as my master was ill a bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dress that night?</p>
               <p>C. Mowet. He had a blue futcout coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did they come into the house?</p>
               <p>C. Mowet. I don't exactly know the time. It was after candles were lighted.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at justice Fielding's?</p>
               <p>C. Mowet. I was, and knew him at first sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so then?</p>
               <p>C. Mowet. I said I never saw him but that one time before; but was sure he was one of the three men.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to that?</p>
               <p>C. Mowet. He bid me look at him two or three times.</p>

               <p>I never was in the prosecutor's house in my life. I was taken on board a ship which I belong to, and brought here in irons on suspicion of stealing of tankards. My irons made me remarkable to be known. The justice told me if it cost him a thousand pounds he'd have my life. He ordered every person (as they came in) into his back room, and told them I was the man, and he would open to them a great scene of villainy. He told me I should certainly be hanged, unless I discovered my accomplices.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you speak with certainty, or can you not?</p>
               <p>D. Young. I really believe the prisoner to be the person. He called for a light, a tankard of beer, and pen, ink and paper, and went into a little room by himself. There was no way of making an<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080007"/> escape without being discovered, except that of jumping out at the window. A young woman that stood at the door (waiting for a pint of beer to be drawn) called, and told us a man had jumped out of the window. I went into the room, and found the man, paper, and tankard were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. What is the value of the tankard ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It cost me nine pounds five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. to D. Young. How did you find the window?</p>
               <p>D. Young. The sash was quite thrown up, when he was sitting in the room a writing the sash was down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the room when he was ?</p>
               <p>D. Young. I was, when he had wrote two lines and a half on the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before he quitted the room?</p>
               <p>D. Young. I had seen him and the tankard not three minutes before he was gone.</p>

            . I am servant to the prosecutor, I delivered a tankard of beer to the prisoner, it was a silver one, about eight o'clock on the 4th of Oct. at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain as to the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Saul. I am, I know him very well; I saw him at Justice Fielding's since, and knew him at the first sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner come in?</p>
               <p>Saul. No, he was sitting in the parlour when I saw him first, he went in there of himself; I went to him, and ask'd him what he'd please to have; he said, My lad get me a tankard of beer, or porter, I can't say which. I carry'd it to him, then he said, My lad, get me a pen, ink and sheet of paper. I carried them to him; then he said, If one Williamson should come to ask for one Williams, shew him in here. I went and left word at the bar with my mistress immediately; after that I went in to snuff the candle, he was sitting writing, and a little time after that came a young woman for a pint of beer, and change for a shilling. I went to the bar, and desir'd my mistress to get the change ready against I came up with the beer; immediately as I came to the door the young woman said, Joe, what is the matter, there is a man come out at the window. I saw the window open, and candle burning. I ran out into the street to see if I could catch him, but could see nothing of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sash was down that night?</p>
               <p>Saul. Yes, I know it was, and the shutters put to, but not bolted within side.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the tankard last?</p>
               <p>Saul. The tankard was standing by him when I went in to snuff the candle.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you say the first time you saw me at Justice Fielding's you did not know me?</p>
               <p>Saul. No, I did not; as soon as I saw his face I told Mr. Fielding that was the man, for I knew his face.</p>
               <p>Eliz. Hewit. I went for a pint of beer to the prosecutor's house on the 4th of Oct. at night; while I was standing at the door, I saw the parlour window open, and a man came out at it; he came to me, and ask'd me if I saw any body knock at that window. I said no. He went back, seemingly to get in again, but instead of that he ran directly away into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. If he had been minded to have got in again, was it easy for him so to do?</p>
               <p>Eliz. Hewit. Yes, very easy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>None of these people ever saw me before they saw me at Justice Fielding's; even that Saul said he could not positively swear to me. I never was in the house in my life. Justice Fielding call'd them all into a private place, and when they came out, then they said to the best of their knowledge I was the man.</p>
               <p>Saul. I was positive to the prisoner before the Justice had spoke a word to me.</p>

I was sent for about the begining of November last to Mr. Wooley's in Cheapside; there was a search warrant given to me, and I was order'd to break a box open, which they said belong'd to the prisoner; I broke it open, and found in it these stockings ( producing 25 pair ) a pair of muffatees and a piece for breeches. After that I went and took the prisoner, and carried him before my Lord-mayor, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for himself ?</p>
               <p>Compton. He said he was very sorry, and if his master would forgive him, he'd never do the like again; it was the first time he ever did so.</p>

               <p>Mr. Townsend. My master Mr. Butler wanting a footman, the prisoner came to offer himself as such. I lik'd the appearance of the lad very well, and hired him for a footman (all but his character.) I went to Mr. Wooley's house for his character; one of the partners in the shop gave me a very good one of him. I asked the man in the shop if he thought him an honest man, who replied he was. I hired him, and he lived with us from the 26th of May to the 12th of Nov following, during which time he justly fulfill'd his trust. I have twice sent him out to change bank notes, one a 20 l. and the other a 30 l. he brought the change to me; once I sent him with our plate to the silversmith to have it weigh'd, when the plate act commenced; he brought it safe. During the time he lived with us, we don't know we lost the value of a halfpenny in any thing. He behav'd very well. Part of the time he was with us we were in the country at my lord Arran's, where was a great quantity of plate; we lost nothing there.</p>
               <p>John Hall. I was with the prisoner at my lord Arran's in the country, where was great quantity of liquor; he behav'd with a great deal of sobriety and order. I do not remember I ever heard him swear an oath, he gain'd the esteem of every person for a sober diligent servant, I believe no body, during that time, either heard him swear or saw him in liquor.</p>

            . On the 13th of Sept. last, Betwixt 8 and 9 o'clock, I was standing at the corner of Philpot-lane, making water: going on I saw the prosecutor and prisoner before me. I saw the prisoner make a motion at the prosecutor's pocket, and draw out his handkerchief, and drop it behind him; there was a man which followed him, whom I took to be his accomplice; he seeing me come up at that instant, cross'd the way, and made off with some precipitation. I took up the handkerchief, and followed the prisoner and prosecutor about 40 yards, and then laid hold on the prisoner's collar. I tap'd the prosecutor on the shoulder, and ask'd him if he had lost any thing; he felt in his pocket, and said he had lost his handkerchief. I shew'd him this; he said it was his handkerchief, so he charg'd the constable with him.</p>

My father took Simpson, and I pursued Parker, who took a run round, and I seized him as he came very near my door.</p>

Parker went down Little Queen-street, and Simpson cross'd the way; I went over to Simpson and asked him if he knew that gentleman, he said what gentleman, I said that gentleman that was with you; he made a stop for some time, and said a man spoke to me and ask'd me to go and drink a glass of wine. I ask'd Simpson if he'd go to our house and look at the gentleman; to see if he knew him; he said yes. I said if you know him to be an honest man, you'll give him a character; he came with me, my son had taken Parker, and I ask'd Simpson if he knew him;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080010"/> he said he was a very honest young man, and no doubt but he can give an account how he came by the shoes.

            . On the 3d of last month my wife call'd me down stairs. There was the prisoner in the shop. She told me he had robbed her of a watch and ran away. I charged him with it, and he partly owned it.</p>
               <p>Q. In what words did he partly own it?</p>
               <p>Pugh. He said he'd go any where to serve his majesty, by land or sea, if I'd release him. I asked him his name. He equivocated with regard to that. First he said it was Ilford, and then Shepherd. I took him before the justice. The justice ask'd him if Ilford was his real or his travelling name; but a person came in, and said his name was Shepherd.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your wife here?</p>
               <p>Pugh. No, she is not. She is very ill.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of his taking the watch, of your own knowledge?</p>
               <p>Pugh. No, I know nothing of that, but by information of my wife.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner present when your wife gave you this account?</p>
               <p>Pugh. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you may tell the court what your wife said in the presence of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Pugh. She said he came in, and asked if she had any watches to sell. She told him she had some that would come pretty cheap. She seeing him look like a countryman, shew'd him a large one. He said, that is too big. Then she shew'd him a less one, and in coming to the head of the staircase, and calling to me, Are you coming down he laid his hand on this watch ( producing one ) [This is my property ] and ran away with it, and she skream'd out, and call'd stop thief, upon which he came back. She met him, and he gave her the watch, and wanted to go away, but a person laid hold on him, and brought him into the shop, where I found him on my coming down stairs.</p>

She led me about to many places: First to Charterhouse Square, and then into Oxford Market. There she gave me the drop.

He came on the 7th of November, being Sunday evening, and called for a pint of beer; I drew it in a silver mug. He drank it in the publick room, and walked out. I had no suspicion of him, not seeing him go out. Soon after he was gone I missed the mug.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he drink alone, or in company?</p>
               <p>Wilson. He had no company with him. He sat alone at a table.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after he was gone might you miss the mug?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It might be ten minutes.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he always used to pay?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes, always. I made inquiry after him, and took him on the 12th, being the Friday following. After that he confessed he had taken it, and where he had sold it, and would make me satisfaction.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he confess this?</p>
               <p>Wilson. This was to me, at the Swan tavern, in the Strand. He owned also he had crased my name from the bottom of it. There was my name there, and where I lived.</p>
               <p>Cross examination.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the prisoner come to your house that night?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I believe he might come in between five and six.</p>

               <p>Wilson. There were. He called for the beer before he went into the room, and then went in.</p>
               <p>Q. What number of people might there be in the room?</p>
               <p>Wilson. There might be half a score or a dozen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any sit near him?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, none sat at the place he did. There was one sat opposite to him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near to him?</p>
               <p>Wilson. It might be two yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. In the time he used your house did you observe any thing in regard to his mind, or did you think he was something odd in his behaviour?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I did think he behaved oddly sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was owing to liquor?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I can't pretend to say it was. Sometimes I thought it was, and sometimes not.</p>
               <p>Q. How would he behave, as you call oddly?</p>
               <p>Wilson. I observed he'd be very odd in contradicting people, or so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he at all other times pay you punctually for your liquor?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Always.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner about 21 or 22 years. I never knew him guilty of any thing of this sort, far from it. When I first knew him I looked upon him to be one of the first rank in the country; a man of good reputation, and character. But latterly I have had transactions with him, and have really thought he was not of sound mind, from a great many actions of his that I could mention.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Harris. I am an apothecary.</p>
               <p>Q. Give the court some instances wherein you have thought he was not of sound mind.</p>
               <p>Harris. When I have came to talk with him he has sometimes threatened to destroy himself, declaring he was tired of life. I have argued with him on the head of self-murder. He would say he was tired of the world, and he should really be glad if he could be convicted for any capital offence, so as to be taken out of the world. When there has been any thing taken out against him, and he has been informed of it, to keep out of the way, he has immediately gone to the person that has taken it out, that he might be taken. He was formerly bred to a trade, and after that he lived on his estate, in a very genteel manner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reeves. I am very well acquainted with the family of this gentleman. I have had occasion to go to see him in prison, and have sometimes thought him not quite in his right mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think it was owing to liquor ?</p>
               <p>Reeves. No, he has had no liquor at all those days, as I have been informed. Several times his discourse seem'd to be such.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080013"/>Q. What was the opinion of the people in the gaol?</p>
               <p>Reeves. There were people in the gaol said, they did not believe him right in his mind.</p>

            . I was the officer. I was going to serve a warrant in Church-Street, and met the prosecutrix and Lynch together. She told me she had been rob'd of her hat, and a cuff of her gown, and told me where. We turned back, and saw this Davis, and another girl, with a basket of oysters. She said Davis was one that had robbed her. I took hold on her, and the other made off directly. I took her to the watch-house. She was very stubborn, and threaten'd she would stab the woman if she was sent to gaol. I said there were three or four more with her, and if she would tell who took the hat it might be the better for her. She told us of two more, and we took them up by her direction; but when they came the prosecutrix cleared them. Then Davis said she took the hat, and tossed it to Harding; so Harding was taken up.</p>

               <p>Dr. Stennett. She was, but there were many goods lock'd up.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stennett. Last year about the 5th or 6th of May, upon the account of the Doctor's health, we went to the Bath, and the prisoner Paul had not been long in my service then; we left her in the house with the whole care of it, and put out the plate and other particular things. We staid longer than we intended, for going to our house in Wales we were detain'd, so that we did not come home till the begining of Oct. When we return'd I found her by herself. I did think of discharging her immediately, by reason of the extravagancy of her bills, but the Dr. desir'd I'd keep her a little longer. I had not been at home long before I missed a little linen, sheets, table cloths, napkins, and the like. I was very solicitous, and inquir'd of my own maid, and sometimes I suspected my own memory, thinking I might have misplaced things, rather than accuse her, for fear she should lose her character; I still missed more and more, for the robbery was not all done while I was out of town, but (as they have confessed) it was committed when we were out on a Sunday. I never knew what was become of the linen till some of it was brought to me, which I knew, because it was mark'd by me; Mr. Morris and Mr. Warburton gave us the first intelligence. I have missed much more, but have mentioned nothing in the indictment but what were brought back (a parcel of linen produced in court.) I am sure these are my property, all mark'd by myself, except one sheet. The first parcel was brought by Miss Overal, the second by Mr. Morris, and the third by Mrs. Tisey; here is in the last an under-petticoat, a breakfast cloth, and two towels; they had overlook'd one of them, and mark'd it for own, but here is my mark, an S upon it, was being in white silk they had not observed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give Mary an' a good character?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stennett. I thought honest, and I gave her a character that I did not charge her with dishonestly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she own she took the things away?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Stennett. I heard her own before justice Fielding that the old woman took them out of the house, and she gave them to her.</p>

In Nov. following she brought some more linen, which she said came from the same place, consisting of 2 shirts, a damask table cloth, and 3 damask napkins; for this parcel she asked more than my wife was willing to give; she said the price was set upon them by the owner. She carried them away, and in about 2 or 3 days after she brought them again, and said the person was contented to take the price offer'd, which was 22 s. 6 d. so I paid for them, and to my great surprise, about two months ago, the servant maid who liv'd with me at that time, and with whom all the three prisoners were acquainted, came and inform'd me that the linen I had purchased was stolen from out of the house of Dr. Stennett.</p>

             some time last summer was 12 months, but can't say the exact time; she said they were a friend's of her's that wanted to dispose of them. I look'd them over, and said I was not a judge of them, but I would send them to a friend that was. I had them 2 or 3 days; she asked me 16 s. for them; my friend valued them at 15 s. After that she sent her daughter Ann, whom I told they were valued at 15 s. She said she dare say the person whose they were would not stand for a shilling. So I bought them (I think there were 4 napkins and a table cloth.)</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Clark. I have a witness here that stop'd the pot-lid. When the prisoner was taken up, he said he knew nothing about the things; but before the justice he acknowledged the taking of them.</p>

            . The prisoner came to me to sell this pot-lid ( holding one in his hand.) I suspected it to have been stolen, and stop'd it. He said he found it in a dust hole.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Frankline. I don't know the day of the month. It was about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. When did you lose this pot lid ?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not come into the house where I live, till old Michaelmas day, and I lost the things about three week after.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Deadley. The prisoner's wife brought a stew-pan and candlesticks to me, and I bought them.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give her for them ?</p>
               <p>M. Dindes. I gave her one shilling and six-pence. Before the justice I heard the prisoner say he sent his wife with them.</p>
               <p>William Corner. I am a constable. Last Sunday was seven night, at night, Mr. Clark's wife brought me a warrant to take up the prisoner at the bar. I did so, and took him before the justice; but he would not confess. The justice committed him for farther examination. On the Monday I had a search warrant. I went to the house of the last evidence, and found the stewpan and candlestick, and brought them before the justice; where the prisoner's wife said, her husband sent her with them to sell, and at last the prisoner confessed he took them.</p>

               <p>I never was before a justice of the peace in my life. I had lived in the house of the prosecutor, and found these things lying upon the stairs there.</p>

               <p>William Vaughan. I was below in my cellar on the 2th of November, in the afternoon, cutting some wood. I heard somebody go into my shop, which I thought to be a customer; I hearkened a little time, to hear if my wife went into the shop. I went up into the shop, and there I saw the prisoner at the bar, behind my counter. I asked him what he wanted. He held up his hand, and said '' Say nothing, and I'll give you half'' I said, what will you give me half of, and as I was going round the counter he put 5 s. 6 d. into my hand; then I laid hold of him. He shew'd me the place where he took the money, which was out of a till.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you lock the till?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. There was never a lock upon it. I had ordered a neighbour to put one upon it some little time before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the till drawn out?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. The till was standing on the ground. There were in it about ten or twelve shillings in half-pence.</p>

A two months ago I lost two crown pieces and being, surprised, I examined a little boy thinking he might take them for play pieces; but found he knew nothing of them. A few days after that I missed a guinea There were 4 l in silver in another place. I told that over, and in a little time after I missed a guinea out of that. After that I told it again, and found it reduced to 26 s. and 6 d. Soon after it was reduced to 19 s. and 6 d. This last was on the 17th of November. I told the affair to an acquaintance, named Clark, and that I suspected the prisoner to be the man, and wanted to catch him. On Friday the 1th of November, in the afternoon, the prisoner came into the kitchen for a pint of beer. He sat down, and seem'd to sham drunk, pretending to go to sleep.</p>
               <p>Q Why did you suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Harison. Because he had lately flash'd his money about and he was known not to be in work, nor had been for a great while.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he use to come often to your house?</p>
               <p>Harison. He used to come about 2 or 3 times in a week. After he had lain with his head down on the table some time, he remov'd from the kitchen into the drinking room, and slept there till about a quarter after seven; then there came a gentleman in, and the prisoner seeing me busy with him, he made his move. I had given my daughter a charge to mind him; presently my daughter deliver'd a candle into my hand, and said he is gone up stairs. I went and followed him up; there was a key in my room door where I lie. I said I am certain I have a thief in the room, but I can't see him. I call'd up Mr. Clark immediately, and said to him the thief is in the room, but he is invisible; but looking under my bed, there I found the prisoner. I took him by the heels and pull'd him out; he at first look'd very pale, after that he began to be impudent; said I, are not you a villain to offer to ruin a family in this nature; said he, I have got nothing of yours, you can't hurt me; you must send for an officer, you are not to detain me here yourself. I sent for an officer immediately, and we examined his pockets, but found nothing but 6 d. and a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080018"/> half-penny upon him. He was taken before the justice, where he own'd he let himself into the room, and hid himself under my bed; and that the key which I found in my room door, was the key of his lodging room door.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he give you when you charg'd him with taking your money?</p>
               <p>Harison. He always deny'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your money kept?</p>
               <p>Harison. It was kept in a cabinet in that room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep that cabinet always lock'd ?</p>
               <p>Harison. I did, but I observed it lately to be alter'd and spoil'd very much, and the escutcheon almost pull'd off and scratch'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you charge him with altering the lock before the justice?</p>
               <p>Harison. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing about him that would open the cabinet lock?</p>
               <p>Harison. We found no key, only a hook.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>On the 19th of November last (having used the prosecutor's house three or four years) I went in there very much in liquor; he said I call'd for a pint of beer, whether I did or not I don't know; he said I laid my head down on the kitchen table, but I can't say whether I did or not; I know after I had been in the kitchen I stumbled in going into the tap room, where I laid my head down in a box; after that I went up stairs and open'd the door with my lodging room key, and thought I was at my own home.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Did you try that key of his, whether it was the prisoner's lodging-room key or no?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I did not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was going to lie down the gentleman came up stairs, and said he had got a thief, which put me in my senses almost. I out of surprise ran and hid myself under the bed; he said he had got the thief, and laid hold of my legs and pull'd me out. I was search'd, and they found but 6 d. and three half-pence about me; they took me to Justice Welch three times. I never saw any thing of the prosecutor's money, nor never knew where he put it.</p>

            . I live at the corner of Church-Street in the Strand. On the king's coronation day I was from home, and as I was returning by St. Martin's Round-house I saw a mob of people. A gentleman there told me there were two women carried in there, for robbing my shop of ribbons. I went into the Round-house to them. There Evans, upon knowing I was master of the shop, fell on her knees, and beg'd for mercy, and said, she had four children, and had lately buried one. The other prisoner cried, and said but little.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the justice with them?</p>
               <p>Lawder. I was, before justice Cox. The ribbons were there produced. The justice asked me if they were my property, and I said they were. They are here now sealed up.

               <p>A. Piggot. Mrs. Lawder was. Upon seeing this, when Smith turned to go out of the shop, I took hold of her, and said, Child, I believe you have got something, which you have not paid for. She said, indeed I have not. I turned her apron aside, and saw the ribbon in a pocket apron. I made her put her hand in, and take it out, and lay it on the counter. There were two pieces. I gave her a shake, and down fell a third. She beg'd to go, and Evans desired I'd beat her, and let her go about her business. The shop soon fill'd. There came a beadle, and took them both away to the Roundhouse. Evans had bargained for a piece of ribbon, but after Smith had taken the ribbon she pretended to be off her bargain. (The ribbon produced in court.)</p>

               <p>R. Groom. I have; his name is William Groom. The prisoner came into our house on the 5th of November, and call'd for a pennyworth of beer. I gave it into her hand in a pewter pint pot.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pot afterwards?</p>
               <p>R. Groom. No, I never did. After that a young man came to me, and said, have you lost a pot? I looked, and missed a gallon pewter pot. He said, a woman had taken one. I sent after the prisoner, and she was brought back, and the gallon pot with her, and also another pewter wine measure pint. She had them both in a bag. ( Produced in court.)</p>

            . On the 5th of November I went to the prosecutor's house, to get a pint of beer for my dinner, where sat the prisoner drinking a pennyworth of beer. She sat a considerable while. After she was gone, a shop keeper's lad came from over the way, and said, that woman is gone out with a gallon pot in her lap. Mrs. Groom desired I'd go after her, so I and the maid ran, and found her, and made her come back. She had the pot, and flung it down; so I took it up, and brought it back with her.</p>

               <p>John Radbourn. About five weeks ago, as near as I can guess, the prisoner stole a vessel off the dray.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose dray was it ?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. It was Mr. Willoughby's dray.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. He lives upon Tower-Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the dray when the vessel was taken?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. It was in <placeName id="t17561208-35-crimeloc179">Watling-Street</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17561208-35-crimeloc179" type="placeName" value="Watling-Street"/>

               <p>Q. Was the dray standing still or going on?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. It was standing still.</p>
               <p>Q. How near the dray was you when he took it?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. I believe I was about a hundred yards from it</p>
               <p>Q What time of the day was it ?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. As near as I can guess it was between one and two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he carry it?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. He carried it about forty or fifty yards. I followed and collar'd him, and he seemed to make resistance against me, by shoving me two or three times.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say for his so doing?</p>
               <p>Radbourn. He said he took the vessel from the dray to knock a nail down in the heel of his shoe.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I took the vessel down as it was going along, with ent to set it down. There was a coach and car going by I set it down as soon as I did not carry it above four steps.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say against the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I can't say he took it, one man may be like another.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you miss it from?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I miss'd it from out of my parlour, where the best of my company use.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live ?</p>

               <p>Q. After what manner was it taken ?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I believe the prisoner to be the very person who was at my house at the time it was stolen; that person came in about half an hour after six o'clock, he call'd for a tankard of beer, a pen, ink and paper, and my maid servant carried them to him. He wrote a fictitious letter. When he came in there was no body in the room but a man that belongs to the Penny Post Office. He sent that man with the letter to Jewen Street; before he was gone with the letter my servant went into the room; he gave her half a crown to change, she brought it out, and my son gave full change for it; she carried it in, and said here is your full change. Very well my dear, said he; she came out again, and went to draw a pot of beer for a person that lives in Newgate-street, and I went in to snuff his candle, when to my great surprise he and the tankard were gone out at the window. I took the candle in my hand and look'd upon the bench, where was the mark of his foot in the sand, and another on the e, and upon the bench in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find the sash ?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I found that up, and the curtains blowing about with the wind.</p>
               <p>Q. Look upon the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Pushee. As to being particular to swear point blank that he is the man I cannot, but I believe him to be the very man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner since you lost the tankard?</p>
               <p>Pushee. On Saturday last I was before Justice Fielding, the prisoner was examined there, when a witness of mine swore against him; he then own'd the fact in my hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080024"/>Q. What words did he use?</p>
               <p>Pushee. The witness said you are the person that I carried the letter for to Jewen-street [here is the letter he return'd and gave to me] there you are, and you cannot deny it. Mr. Fielding said see and search the prisoner if he has any writings in his pocket to compare them together; the prisoner said he had no writings at all. Well, said Mr. Fielding, Mr. Ball, pray what have you got to say to this ? he said, Why and please your worship it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charg'd at that time with taking the tankard, or was the conversation about the letter?</p>
               <p>Pushee. It was about the tankard and letter too.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I when I was first examined say to the man that my prosecutor brought there, do you know me or not, and what answer did he make ?</p>
               <p>Pushee. I was not by at that time, but when the prisoner at the bar saw me and my son, he immediately came up to me, saying, What do you know of me, am I the man, am I the man?</p>
               <p>John Skindalsby. I was at the prosecutor's house on the 25th of October last, between six and seven at night; Mr. Bail the prisoner at the bar came into the room where I was, and call'd for a tankard of beer, pen, ink and paper; he wrote a letter, and paid me six pence to carry it into Jewen-street. I saw him write it, it was neither wafer'd nor seal'd. I carried it there, and shew'd it to a man, who read it, and said it was all a pack of nonsense.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Jewen street from the prosecutor's house?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. It is about a quarter of a mile distant</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the letter?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I return'd and gave it to the prosecutor, and said I could not find such a house as it was directed to; the prosecutor said I'll go into the room and shew it him, and tell him you can't find the house (he then going to light the candle) he went in and found the window up, and the curtains flying with the wind, and the prisoner and tankard both gone.</p>
               <p>Q How long might you have been gone?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. To the best of my knowledge I believe about half an hour, or a little better.</p>
               <p>Q Was you first in the room or the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I was in the room when he came in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in the room after he came in ?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I continued there about 3 or 4 minutes, just while he wrote the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Where was I when you came into Justice Fielding's?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. You was in the room where all the prisoners come.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. How long was you in the room before you saw me?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I can't justly say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. When you did see me, did not I come up to you and speak to you, and say, honest friend do you know me?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. When I came into the room I pull'd off my hat, and look'd about to see which was the man, and the people fell a laughing at me. He did not say to me friend do you know me, they only made game of me.</p>
               <p>Q. from the prisoner. Did not you say you did not know me?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say now to the prisoner at the bar?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I am sure the prisoner is the person that sent me with the letter that night the tankard was lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at him well and consider?</p>
               <p>M. Palmer. I am sure he is the man, the little boy carried in his beer; after that he ask'd me to bring him a pen, ink and paper. When I went with them he asked me if I could give him 2 s. 6 d. for half a crown. I took his half crown, and carried him his change, and after that he asked this man if he could carry a letter for him to Jewen-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in the room first, the prisoner or the man?</p>
               <p>M. Palmer. The prisoner was in the room before the man came in.</p>
               <p>Q. to Skindalsby. Which did you say was in the room first, the prisoner or you?</p>
               <p>Skindalsby. I was in the room first, I was there when he came in; I had a penny worth of beer at the other box, and was warming it by the fire.</p>

            </rs>, Nov. 19.* </p> 
               <p>James Dunnel. The deceased told me the prisoner had bit his finger; after which he grew so bad that he was obliged to go to the hospital. I visited him there, and allow'd him a shilling a week.</p>
               <p>Q. When did this affair happen ?</p>
               <p>Dunnel. It was on the <rs id="t17561208-37-cd188" type="crimeDate">13th of September</rs>

               <p>Q. Did you see it done?</p>
               <p>Dunnel. No, I did not. It was done at our house; the prisoner had been exceeding troublesome, and after the deceased had been with the watch to take him to the compter he came back again.</p>
               <p>Q. What house do you keep?</p>
               <p>Dunnel. It is a publick house, my mother keeps it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the prisoner carried to the compter for?</p>
               <p>Dunnel. For breeding a disturbance in our house. He came there about 11 at night on the 13th of September, with his wife and two children; he call'd for a pint of beer, which was drawn him; before he had drank it half out, there was some company in the next box with whom he would interfere; they beg'd of him to keep his own company, but he began to be very troublesome. I being backwards heard a noise. I came into the room and beg'd of the prisoner not to swear so, but to go home. He abused me, calling me Mungrel and half Mungrel, and said it was by such as him that I liv'd, he'd lick me and whip my a - se, and the like, till I was forced to call the watch, which came. I beg'd they'd take that man out of the house. I only desir'd they'd get him out at the door and discharge him, which they did. After that he came in and abused me more than before. Then I went out of his sight, and presently I saw him go out at the door. I went and shut him out, then I went to his wife and beg'd of her to go; she said she would not. Soon after that came a brickbat and broke two panes of glass.</p>

               <p>Q. Who threw that?</p>
               <p>Dunnel. I believe the prisoner did; then I opened the door, and the company ran after the prisoner; he fought his way and clear'd himself all thro' them; full he was not satisfied, he would fight somebody, when a man took upon him to fight him, and did beat him. But before this he knock'd the constable down (he is now so very bad of the bruises that we don't know whether he'll live or not.) I took him by the hair of his head to pull him off the constable. After this battle I understood there was some assistance coming from the watch-house, and hand cuffs to put on his hands. The prisoner lay on the ground, and would not be hand cu'd [then I went to see how my wife did, for she was child and much affrighted; she has since deliver'd of a dead child, and I believe on this account.] made shift to carry him to the compter the deceased was one that assisted, be with the rest, and told me that the p bit several of them and his finger was bit.</p>
               <p>Q Did you see his ?</p>
               <p>Dunnel. No I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Which hand was on ?</p>
               <p>Dunnel. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Q. Can't the constable ?</p>
               <p>Dunnel. No, I was with him he is so ill he cannot be here;</p>

             in the hospital; I don't exactly know the day he was brought in; this accident happen'd I believe about a fortnight or three weeks before I saw him, he was then only an out patient. I advised him by all means to come into the hospital, that he might be under a more frequent inspection.</p>
               <p>Q. What time do you think he might come into the hospital?</p>
               <p>Nourse. I think it is about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition did you find him?</p>
               <p>Nourse. I did not find his finger very bad, it was very much inflamed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look upon him to be in a dangerous condition?</p>
               <p>Nourse. No, after he came in his hand was not in a very dangerous condition; but in about a week or ten days after he had a fever, which occasioned a great inflammation in his hand, and so far affected him, that it made if necessary for me to take his finger off, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had he been in the house before his finger was taken off ?</p>
               <p>Nourse. I believe it was after he had been in the house about a fortnight. I defer'd it longer than my judgement directed me, in compliance to his request. After that all his complaints ceased, and his sore seem'd in a healing condition. I apprehended from the appearance of it that it would be w in a little time; but in twenty four hours, when we did not expect it, his wound being in a healing way, he was siezed with a fever. I remember I had seen him on the Tuesday. and on the Thursday after he was siezed with his fever, which soon took him off.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion was the reason of his death ?</p>
               <p>Nourse. I am quite clear he died of the fever.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that fever was, or was not occasioned by the wound?</p>
               <p>Nourse. Not at all. He was as free as I am from all sort, of complaints. His wound was in a fine way of healing.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion that he died on that bite or wound, or not?</p>
               <p>Nourse. I am clear of opinion that he did not die of that bite or wound.</p>

               <p>Q. By how many persons?</p>
               <p>Preston. I saw three men. M'Collister was one of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080027"/>Q. can you say who knock'd you down?</p>
               <p>Preston. No, I cannot; for in knocking me down they funned me. I found myself on my back. One of them had his fingers and thumb in my mouth, attempting to gag me, and I heard these words, By the great Jesus if you stir, or speak, you are a dead man. I saw M'Collister while I lay there, standing on my left hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell who spake those words?</p>
               <p>Preston. No, I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say to the other prisoner</p>
               <p>Preston. I can't say I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got any of your things again ?</p>
               <p>Preston. I have got my hat again.</p>
               <p>Q. Look carefully at M'Collister and consider.</p>
               <p>Preston. I am sure M'Collister was one of them. I thought it prudent not to resist while lying on my back; but I stretch'd my arms out as if I had been dead or helpless. They all three ran away together. They were not got twenty yards before I jumped up, and pursued them down Smock-Alley, very near them, calling out thieves. At the bottom of the alley is a court which is no thorough-fair, and this M'Collister ran up there. He was coming back again, and I made a blow at him with my fist; but he being upon the full run, and a stronger man than me, he beat me down again. He rather ran over me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of that court?</p>
               <p>Preston. I think that court is call'd Dolphin-Court. I was presently up again, and pursued him to the end of Steward-Street, where I came so nigh him as to endeavour to strike up his heels; but upon missing him I fell down again, and one Mr. Golding coming along laid hold of him, and secured him. We took him to the headborough's house, and secured him there all night; the next morning he was carried before Sir Samuel Gower, and he committed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him?</p>
               <p>Preston. We did; but found nothing about him but a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you get your hat?</p>
               <p>Preston. That was found at the end of Gun-Street, by one Mr. Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Edwards here?</p>
               <p>Preston. No, he is not. (The hat produced in court, and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself before the justice?</p>
               <p>Preston. He had but very little to say.</p>

            . I live in Steward-Street. About nine o'clock at night, on the 22d of November, coming out of my house I heard a cry of stop thief. I saw M'Collister come running from Gun Street, to the corner of Steward-Street. I catch'd hold of him by the arm, but he being on a swift run got from I ran up the footway way in Steward-Street, and with him. At last I jumped full upon him, got him by the, and kept him. He made a struggle. I said I'd keep him. He put his right-hand down to his breeches pocket, which was open. I was afraid he had something there, with which he might do me hurt. I took care of his hand. Presently came up the prosecutor, and other persons. As soon as he saw the man, and heard his voice, he said, '' That is one '' of the men that knock'd me down and rob'd '' me.'' There was a hat taken up at the corner of Gun Street, and deliver'd to the prosecutor I saw the prisoner examined in the headborough's house. There we searched him, and found a large clasp knife in his breeches pocket, where he was endeavouring to put his hand. ( Produced in court.) We carried him before Sir

            . I and the two prisoners at the bar were coming down Petticoat Lane, with one Brown along with us. He is not taken. We met the prosecuter. Brown said, I believe this man has got money, let's follow him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way were you going ?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. We were going towards White Chappel. He went up to the upper end of the lane; Brown and Kimest -</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Kimest ?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. That is the prisoner's right name. They went after him and drag'd him back. When I came up he was lying on his back.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get him down?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I can't tell how they got him down. whether he was knocked down or not; I was not time enough to know that. Brown had his hand in his pocket. He drag'd out something which made a jingling. I thought it was his watch. After he took his hand out of his pocket we ran away, and ran up a place where there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080028"/> no passage. At the end of Petticoat-Lane we were all forced to retu rn back again; by that time there were many people. Brown ran by himself, and did not run up that place. In returning we ran through the croud. Some pursued me, and some Kimest.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure Knowlan was there ?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. He was; but I did not see him meddle with the man at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way did you take after you returned from that court?</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I don't know which way. I am a stranger there, but when I stopped I found myself in Rag-Fair.</p>
               <p>M'Collister's Defence.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to say, only as I am a young man I am willing to serve his majesty. I desire a favourable report may be made. Mr. Stanley has put them upon this to swear my life away. This man Armstrong has committed several murders in Ireland, and now he has run away with an heiress from Dublin.</p>
               <p>Knowlan's Defence.</p>
               <p>That fellow Armstrong has been concerned with thieftakers to swear my life away.</p>
               <p>Armstrong. I stood my trial in Ireland for a murder, and was acquitted. Stanley never spake to me about this thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you seen him write?</p>
               <p>Hilyer. I have a great many times, and know his writing perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Hilyer. It is not like it at all.</p>

               <p>Hilyer. There are three partners. They live at Hull. I am acquainted with them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this bill the hand-writing of either of them?</p>
               <p>Hilyer. No, it is not. It is a very bad imitation as ever I saw. It is pretended to imitate Mr. Blunt's hand.</p>

               <p>I know Messrs. Sill, Bridges and Blunt to be men of credit, and this man that it is drawn on I thought to be as great a man. He is a person I have done great service to, and he promised to lend me a sum. I met him, and he told me he was disappointed of cash; but he had the bill, so I took it, and unhappily involved myself in this affair. He has made his escape. I was in hopes that, if I had my trial put off, by that time I might take him. You see very plainly I have nobody to plead my cause, and he is out of the way. What can I say in this dilemma? I hope your Lordship will take it into consideration, as I am but a youth, and the man that is witness of my taking this bill is about. His name is Oader.</p>

He left me in the country, and would not serve me at Maidstone-Fair, and I challenged these to be my breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Earles. I live in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you charge him with stealing the breeches which you lent him?</p>
               <p>Earles. No. I challenged another pair upon him which I remarkably knew, by their being flit up the seam. The pair laid in the indictment are not them which I lent him. When I challenged them, he had them upon him, and he afterwards confessed them to be mine before the justice.</p>

               <p>Earles. Yes.</p>

               <p>Earles. I will not take upon me to say he has, or he has not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe he ever accounted with you for those breeches that you found upon him?</p>

               <p>Earle. It is customary in our trade for our journeymen to wear those cheap breeches, but not to sell them for doe skin. They wear them that poor people may imagine they are better made, and a better sort; but they are not to run away with them.</p>

             in taking the examination of the prosecutor, relating to something that he charged the prisoner with having stolen. It was a pair of breeches. Some circumstances appeared very extraordinary, and of such a nature as might well justify our taking bail for Goston's appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take bail?</p>
               <p>Justice Pell. We did; upon the whole it appeared to us it was owing to a quarrel.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prosecutor did not say he believed the prisoner took the breeches with no felonious intent.</p>
               <p>Pell. He did say so; after I had open'd the nature of the design he was carrying on, I put it close to him whether he could with a safe conscience see this man convicted for stealing these breeches, and receive the punishment in consequence thereof. He said, '' Sir, I don't believe he did design to rob me, the whole affair was but a quarrel. I employed him at two fairs, Sittingbourn for one, where he received a great deal of money for me, for which I made him an allowance; and after that he took me up, and with great barbarity carried me before the mayor. After that I charg'd him with having my breeches; then coming to town, and being advised by some attorney, the sessions being then begun at Hicks's-Hall, I went and got a bench warrant, and had him taken up.'' He went farther and said, it was customary in trade, when they contract for those people whom they call barkers to attend them at fairs, to give them breeches in order to wear, and as I understood it, with intent to impose on those that came to buy. On my examining Goston, he told me he had sold three or four pair of breeches which he had worn at the same fair; and as it appear'd (those being sold) he must have return'd either without breeches or have put on a pair of his master's, I brought both parties to this, for both to leave their disputes. The prosecutor had challeng'd Goston with a pair of breeches; the other said they were his, and he was to wear them till he got to town, and then they were to reckon and settle. It was recommended by an attorney to draw up articles of agreement between them, and they agreed to it. There was a gentleman who said he had trusted Goston with hundreds of pounds, and it was customary in that trade for the servants to put breeches on when they go out of town, in order to wear them, and then sell them for second-hand breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Is it not customary in the trade to lend people in the situation of the prisoner breeches to go down to fairs with, on such an occasion.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner ever since he was in short coats. I never heard or knew of any thing that touch'd his character; he work'd for me some time. I don't know that ever I had any room to suspect him.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Griffith. I am a shoemaker, I have trusted him several times to shut up my shop, and I have some scores of dozens of shoes at times; he might have wrong'd me of many had he been so minded, and I never missed them.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion of him now?</p>
               <p>Griffith. I would employ him again was he out of his trouble, to-morrow if the court please.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I have known him 16 years, in all that time I never heard any ill of him till now.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175612080032"/>Q. What has been his general character ?</p>
               <p>Witness. That of an honest lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you employ him again, was he at liberty?</p>
               <p>Witness. I would in my way.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I have known him 7 years, I have trusted him, and never found him wrong me of the value of a pin in my life. I would trust him again to-morrow, was he out of his trouble.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I have known him from his mother's arms, he always bore a good character; I never heard any ill of him in my life. I am worth a hundred pounds. I could trust him with it all, was he out of his trouble.</p>
               <p>A Witness. The prisoner has work'd with me about a year. I never missed any thing, or heard an ill character of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known him?</p>
               <p>Witness. I have known him 14 years, if I had five thousand pounds I'd trust him with it this minute, was he out of trouble.</p>
               <p>A Witness. I was at the birth of the prisoner, and have known him ever since; his parents died when he was very young. I kept him four or five years; he was very just. I never found any thing deficient by him in my life, nor heard of any thing ill of him before this.</p>

               <p>Votier. No, none at all; the kitchen door was always lock'd, and the key brought up into my own room. When the things were missed she was charg'd with them, and fell down on her knees and own'd the taking them all.</p>

               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>Votier. The very night we took her up, which was on the 22d of November; she beg'd for mercy, and said if I would have patience she would fetch them again the next morning; she had the blankets from off the bed I lie on.</p>

               <p>Dudley. He was pudling and mudling about near where my lighter lay. I ask'd him what he was doing there; he said, no harm, that he was a poor man and a cripple; his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Dudley. This was at <placeName id="t17561208-44-crimeloc222">Brewer's key</placeName>

Being walking on shore by my charge, I clap'd my hand upon the prisoner, and saw some hats under his great coat; there had been some hats taken out of a lighter that day, which were not survey'd, and they were under the care of the king's watchman on the key.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Dudley. I am a king's watchman. I got the man by the collar, called out for assistance, and held him till assistance came. Then I took him, and the hats he had got, into our office.</p>
               <p>Q. How many hats were there?</p>
               <p>Dudley. There were fifty-nine hats, call'd chip hats, for women. Then the prisoner was order'd into custody. (The bats produced in court.) These are the hats which I took upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had he got them?</p>
               <p>Dudley. They were under his great coat.</p>
