                  </hi>. I am a tailor, of 2, Queen-street—on 4th February, about a quarter to 1 in the morning, I was going home, and saw two men in advance of me—one of them, the prisoner, was six yards in advance of me—he grasped me by the throat, and the other struck me on my eye, tore my waistcoat open, and broke my guard chain—I had no watch—I called out, "Murder! police!" and they ran away—I saw them as they came towards me—there was a lamp within six or seven yards—I could see the prisoner's face, and am sure he is the man—I pursued them—one ran into Leicester-square, and the other into Lisle-street—one was stopped by a constable fifteen or twenty yards from me—the part of the chain taken was not worth above sixpence.</p>

               <p>knowing that there was nobody before him, I seized him, and took him back to the bottom of the street, but saw nobody—I kept him twenty minutes, and then let him go, saying, "Now mind, I am going to take a good look at you, and, if you have done anything, I shall know you again"—I was called about a fortnight ago, and identified him—this was about a hundred yards from Sidney-alley.</p>

I took the prisoner on 25th March, at 11, Newcastle-street, Strand—I had been searching for him ever since—on opening the door, I saw some chimney soot on the floor—I looked up the chimney, and saw the prisoner there—I called him down, and told him I should take him in custody for being concerned with a man named Rose in a highway robbery—he said, "I know I shall have ten years for what I am going for, and I will kill you, you b—"—he aimed at my head with the leg of a bedstead, which struck me on the shoulder—we had a great struggle, assistance came, and I took him to the station—the blow rendered my arm sore for some time; I could not lift it to my head—if it had been on my head it would have been very serious.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Secretary of the Friend-in-Need Sick Fund Society—I have our enrolled rules here—the prisoner was engaged by the Society to get persons to become members, and to receive their sub<lb/>scriptions—the prisoner's appointment is in writing; this is it—(<hi rend="italic">This appointed George Clark as</hi> "agent," <hi rend="italic">he agreeing to remit all moneys once a week to the office, and send in a detailed balance-sheet once a month</hi>)—he was our agent, with an interval, up to 10th January—his agency altogether ceased at one time, but he was re-appointed in the same way—I have not that appointment here—an explosion of gas blew out the office windows, and a great number of papers were blown away, burnt, or lost—I have searched the office for the second appointment, but cannot find it, and believe it was destroyed at the fire—it was precisely the same as the first.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How do you know that it was the same? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> They are all on printed forms—this was near the top of the pigeon-hole, and therefore would be more likely to be disturbed—papers in that very pigeon-hole were disturbed—instructions on a portion of the same sheet are given to agents at the time they are appointed.</p>

Johnson said he would give him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for it, which was refused—Beeston took out three cards to raffle for the pin, and they bet 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. that they would win it, and Johnson lost—after they had lost twice, we lent them our watches, because they had lost their money, until they could get a 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note changed, which Johnson produced—I did not have it in my hand, but I saw 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on it—the man who is not here wanted to change it; he and Johnson suggested our lending our watches; the man who is not here said that he had lost 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—mine was a gold watch and a gold chain, worth about 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. together—</p>

               <p>the note changed—I remained with Johnson and Beeston—Johnson then asked me to go outside and speak to him, and I went out—he said, "Go inside and stop with the man with the watches till I come back"—and when I went back the man was gone and the watches—I went out to look for him, but did not find him—I found my friend in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I did not see the men again that evening, but I met Johnson one afternoon in the neighbourhood of the Waterloo-road, and gave him in custody.</p>

I have twopence," and the prisoner asked me for the half-crown back again, and I gave it him back—I thought there was something wrong, and looked at the change—I saw one of the shillings was bad, and said, "This is not the money I laid down; this is a bad shilling"—the prisoner said he had no other about him—I called my husband, and they both ran away, leaving some of the beer—the two shillings I gave the prisoner were good—he came again on 27th February, alone, and asked for a glass of ale—I recognised him directly he came in—he gave me a florin in payment—I tried it, bent it up, and told him I could not take it—he was going to take it up as I laid it on the counter—I called my husband, and the prisoner ran out directly—I went out after him, and saw him at the top of the court, looking back—I said, "That is the man"—my husband took him in custody in King-street, I believe—I gave the constable the florin that day, and the shilling the day after.</p>

I reside at Charlton, Kent—about 4 o'clock on the afternoon of 4th March, I was standing on the city side of London-bridge—I had a watch in my waistcoat pocket—there was a very great crowd—I felt something at my pocket, saw a hand on my chain, and missed my watch—I immediately turned, laid hold of the prisoner, and charged him with taking my watch—he was the nearest person to me—I do not think any other person had the opportunity of taking it—I called out "Police!"—a policeman immediately came up, and I gave the prisoner in charge—the key</p>

               <p>RICHARD HOOPER (<hi rend="italic">City-policeman</hi>, 383). I was on duty on London<lb/>bridge, almost close to the prosecutor—I heard him accuse the prisoner of taking his watch, and I immediately went towards him, and took him into custody—I saw the bow of the watch and the keys at his feet; another constable picked them up, and handed them to me—I searched the prisoner on the spot, and also at the station—I found on him two sixpences, and six-pence in copper, but no watch—I asked his address, he would not give any.</p>

I have been looking out for you for this last three months"—a woman came in with him, and when I said that she <hi rend="italic">bolted</hi> out of the place and ran away—the prisoner stood very quietly till the police came, and then I gave him in charge—all he said was, "I took it in Leadenhall-market"—three months ago he came in for a bottle of lemonade and a cheroot—I was rather busy at the time, and alone in the bar, and had not the chance of taking him—he then gave me a bad half-crown, and I gave him change—I did not examine it till he had gone, and I put it on the side-board where we keep the small change, and afterwards tested it, and found it was bad—I marked it, put it away, and gave it to the policeman with the one passed on the 19th—I am quite certain the prisoner is the man—I could not be mistaken—I took notice of him.</p>

I live at Turnham-green, with my father and mother—I know the prisoners—Isaac Brooks is married—in January last he lived at No. 1, Chapel-place—Joseph lived in the same house—in January last he was keeping company with me—I was at their house on Monday evening, 19th January—the prisoners were there when I went in—it was a little after 6 when I went there—they had done tea—I can't exactly tell the time, it is so long ago—Joseph had on corduroy trousers and a brown corduroy jacket when I first went in—after I had been there a short time they both went out—they were not out long; it might be about a quarter of an hour; they did not say where they were going—they did not say any<lb/>thing when they came back—they came in, and Joseph sat down—they were not talking together—Joseph sat down for about a quarter of an hour; he was not talking at all to Isaac during that time—Isaac was sitting in a chair—after Joseph had sat for about a quarter of an hour he asked me what time the pawnshops shut up—I said I would go and ask my mother—I went home; it is only six doors off, No. 6, Chapel-place—my mother was out, but I asked my father—I then came back and told Joseph the time my father said the pawnshops closed, 10 o'clock—upon that Joseph told his sister-in-law, Mrs. Brooks, to fetch his trousers and fetch his gun—I don't know where she was to fetch the trousers from; they were in the house—she was to fetch his trousers, and go to the pawnshop and fetch his gun—she was to get as much on the trousers as would fetch his gun home—he mentioned the pawnbrokers where the gun was, Mr. Ayres—I went out with Mrs. Brooks—Joseph did not say anything to me about being quick—I went with Mrs. Brooks to Mr. Ayres', at Hammersmith—she took the trousers with her, and pawned them, and fetched the gun; she carried the gun—it was a one-barrelled gun, the one they have got here—we came home fast from Hammersmith, and when we got home Mrs. Brooks gave the gun to Joseph—he said he was going to sell it—Isaac was indoors at that time, in the room—he was in the room when Joseph told us to go and get the gun from Mr. Ayres—when Joseph said he was going to sell the gun, I asked him where he was going to—he said, "Black Lion-lane"—I know Black Lion-lane; it is not a great way from where they lived, towards Hammersmith—I said, "Will you let me go?"—he said no, Because my mother would come after me; he gave no other reason—he then left the house with the gun—Isaac remained in the house, in the same room—I was there when Joseph came back—I had not moved away from the room all the time—Joseph was not away long; not above twenty minutes, I think; I don't think it was any longer—Isaac was in the room during the time that Joseph was away; he was sitting on the chair—he was doing nothing; he seemed very restless—he spoke to me sometimes—I don't recollect anything particular that he said—when Joseph came back he had the gun with him—he put it up in the corner, and said, "God bless the</p>

I live at Acton, and am a gardener—I know the prisoner Isaac Brooks—I have known him from a boy—on the evening of 19th January, I went to Petherton Villa, just after 8 o'clock—it was about a quarter-past 8, I should think—I saw the deceased Davey lying on the ground, dead—I saw six or eight persons there when I got there—I after<lb/>wards saw the prisoner Isaac Brooks there—he came up to my left side and spoke to me, and I spoke to him—he said, "How are you, Charley?" and I said, "How do you do, Isaac?"—I said, "This is a shocking affair," and he said it was—I said, "I never knew a more cold-blooded affair than this in my life"—he said, "Nor more did I"—I said, "I think it must have been done out of spite," and he said, "I think so, too"—at this time the doctor came up, and I left—I never saw Isaac afterwards—I saw two men there at the same time named Moore and Longhurst.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Walnut-tree Cottages, Acton—on Monday, 19th January. I was in Acton-town—I saw Thomas Kelsey, a police-constable, in the town; I followed him from the town down Church-road; he was running, and I ran with him—I had heard the report of fire-arms; I was then in the town of Acton—I ran with Kelsey to Petherton Villa—I can't say exactly how far I was from Petherton Villa when I heard the shot</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police-inspector. T</hi>). About 10 o'clock on Monday night, 19th January, I first received information of the death of William Davey, a constable of my division—I proceeded at once from Hammersmith to Petherton Villa, Acton, a distance of about three miles—I there saw Ser<lb/>geant Bonnick with Mr. Scotney—in consequence of something communi<lb/>cated to me by Bonnick, I went to No. 1, Chapel place, Back-common, Turnham-green—I arrived there about 12 o'clock—we did not at that time know where the prisoners resided—we found out about half-past 1, and then went to No. 1, Chapel-place—we knocked at the door, and the prisoner Isaac answered from a window up stairs—Scotney requested him to come down—he came down in his night-dress—I asked him if he had any fire-arms—he made no answer—I then asked him where his brother was—he said, "Up stairs,"—I left Isaac in charge of Mr. Scotney for the moment, and went up stairs, and I was followed by Mr. Scotney with Isaac—I went into the room in which Joseph Brooks was in bed—I said, "Joseph Brooks!" he said, "Yes"—I had a lamp with me, I was in my police dress—when I said, "Joseph Brooks," and he said, "Yes," he seemed to tremble very much in his voice; he was lying in bed—I said he would be charged with his brother with the murder of police-constable Davey at Acton—that was the first thing I said—he did not make any observation to that—I then said, "Have you any fire-arms?"—he made no reply at first—I said, "You need not answer any questions unless you like; I ask you again, have you any fire-arm?"—he said, "I had a gun, but it is at the shop at Acton"—Mr. Scotney came into the room in the mean time, and he also asked him if he had any fire-arms—the prisoner was at that time sitting up in the bed—Mr. Scotney asked him the question about the same time as I did, and he made the reply in answer to both questions that he had a gun, and it was at the shop at Acton—Mr. Scotney reached over the bed, which was close by the wall, and pulled the bed back, to feel if there was anything under the bed—he then left the room, and accom<lb/>panied Isaac into the room where his wife was, leaving me with Joseph—I told him to get up out of bed—when he got up, I turned down the bed from the top, and under the bed, between the bed and the mattress, I found this fowling-piece as it is now—the muzzle of the gun was nearest the pillow—it was lying longways in the bed as the prisoner was lying—I said to the prisoner, "What do you call this?" he turned round, and saw what I had in my hand, and said, "Oh! I forgot it was there"—I examined the gun, I put my little finger into the muzzle as I took it from the bed, and I said, "This gun has been recently discharged"—the muzzle was quite greasy, and my finger was quite black from the powder, the barrel was quite cold—I looked at the nipple; there was no cap; the cap that had discharged the gun was off, but I should judge from the smell of the nipple that it had been very recently discharged—the prisoner did not make any observation when I said the gun had been recently discharged—he treated the matter very</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, of 21, Union-place, South Wharf-road, Paddington—the deceased, John Stafford, was my brother—on 4th February, between 9 and 10 in the morning, I was at work at the arches of the Great Western Railway—I was employed by Lester at the second arch from the one that fell—my brother was in the arch that fell—we were ex<lb/>cavating the soil on both sides, and the carts were taking it away—I never worked in the arch that fell—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a model of it—I do not know whether there was any coal in the bunkers; I never heard either of them say that there were coals there—about 7 in the morning Dowse, one of the men who got killed, came and spoke to me, but not in the prisoner's presence—I then went and looked at the arch, and saw the second pier, the iron stanchion lying on the ground after it fell from the roof—that was the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186304060044"/>
               <p>hind one—one of the drivers, who is here, tied it to his cart, and drew it out of the way—neither of the prisoners were present then—we were authorized by Mr. Edwards to draw the first stanchion on the Tuesday, about a quarter to 4 o'clock; the second was drawn out of the way, between 7 and 8—only one "Eight strut" was put up on Monday night before we removed the first stanchion—this piece of wood represents the strut—after the second stanchion was drawn out, I saw Mr. Edwards there, who told me he was in the place from a quarter to 9 to 9 in the morning, on which it fell at 7—he came into the arch where we were working, but I did not see him in the arch that fell—he told me he had been there, but he did not tell me on the same day; it was when the Coroner came to look over the place—the stanchion was drawn out at 7, and the bunker fell at a quarter to 10—the men were working all the while—when the first stanchion was put away a strut was put up, but when the second stanchion was taken away no other strut was put up; there was no support at all—I do not know who ordered the first strut to be put up, but I believe Mr. Barnes put it up; he is here—I cannot say whether I saw Edwards there after the second stan<lb/>chion had been taken away—there was plenty of room for two struts to be put up, and plenty of time; it could easily have been done—Lester ordered us to go to work, and paid us—I heard the bunker fall—I was in the next arch but one; it covered four men, two of whom were killed—the coals smothered them up—I should say there were fifty tons of coal in the bunker—I cannot say whether Lester did or did not order any struts to be put up.</p>

I am a labourer, of 102, Star-street—on the morning of the accident, Wednesday, I was working down at the <hi rend="italic">goot</hi> shed at the well—Lester employed me—I know that there were coals in the bunkers on the Saturday previous, when I was working under the arch that was empty, with Charles Levey, the second arch from the one that fell—when I was at work Lester came up and down a dozen times—I called him, and said to him, "What are you going to do about this iron column?" (that was the upright which was up in the second arch from the one which fell, for the purpose of supporting the bunker, but there were no coals there—some bunkers were empty unless there was about a sack in them, and some were full—this is the model of one arch; there are two iron columns in it)—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186304060045"/>
               <p>Lester replied, "Down with it, and let us have the b—y muck in the cart"—the muck was the ground round the column—the ground I was excavating did not interfere with that arch at all—I turned round and said, "Look here, Lester, recollect there is a lot of coals under that arch"—he said, "Coals be d—d; let us have the muck out"—this referred to another arch, and I do not believe that foundation would interfere with the one that fell down—he was speaking of the stanchion supporting the arch under which I was working—Lester paid part of my wages, and part was paid out of Messrs.

I am professor of the art of construction at King's College—I have examined the scene of this accident at the Great Western Railway—the cause of the accident was the weight of the coals after the removal of the columns—the proximate cause of the fall, was the removal of the support—I can only assume that the bunkers fell from the absence of support under them.</p>

Lester said that he was there at half-past 9, and did not observe that the second pillar was down, or he would not have worked under it, and had given orders, for it not to be taken away; that he never heard that there were coals in the bunkers, and did not use the expressions to him.</hi>

On the morning of 25th March, I was on duty at twenty minutes to 2 o'clock in High Holborn, and met the prosecutor and prisoner walking together—the prosecutor said he wished to give the prisoner in charge for attempting to extort two shillings from him coming through Lincoln's-inn-fields—I took the prisoner—the prose<lb/>cutor was quite sober—the prisoner was slightly the worse for drink, but understood what he was about—when we got to the station, the prisoner said that he was going home to Gray's-inn-lane, and was stopped by the prosecutor, who put his hand under the crutch of his leg, and wanted to take indecent liberties with him—as he was leaving the dock he said, that he wished the prosecutor paralized before morning—the prosecutor was there at the time, he went with us to the station.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 289, Bethnal-green—on the evening of 1st April, I was called to see the prosecutrix—I found a large bruise on her right side, with a central ecchymosed spot, which I suppose was where the blow was received; it arose from congestion of the vessels from external injury—it was a recent bruise—I have seen these rivets—I think a rivet discharged from a pistol would be likely to cause the bruise I saw, and it might have perforated her body and killed her—there was a hole in her mantle corresponding with the position of the bruise.</p>

               <p>it up to us—he sent up journey-sheets every Saturday evening—he remitted money from time to time throughout the journey, when he had it in a re<lb/>mittable form—the journey-sheet should be a copy of this book, containing the amount of the bill delivered, the amount of deductions, and the amount paid—the journey-sheets received by us were entered in a book called the travellers'-book—on his return home, that book was compared with this one, the total amount of receipts were agreed, the sums remitted on the journey were deducted, and it was his duty then to hand us over the balance—any moneys received by him after sending the last journey-sheet, it was his duty to enter in the travellers'-book, striking the balance, and paying over the money—there is no journey-sheet including the 5th November; that date is in the book—there is no sum in the travellers'-book of 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Lingford on 5th November, or near that date, but there is a sum of 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from J.

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>February—the last, entry is from Peterborough, and he can come up from there in two or three hours; the date of that is 26th February, and that is the last place he goes to on coming home—we have a customer named Samuel Sutton Lingford in the same way of business as Mr. Joseph Ling<lb/>ford—he had some goods from us on 13th December, the gross amount of which was 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., subject to discounts and allowances—Mr. Samuel Lingford generally pays on the second journey after the receipt of the goods—we never had a journey overpaid before this one in which the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. over<lb/>plus occurred—I never recollect such a thing happening before—that would not necessarily show that the prisoner had received more money than he had given the particulars of in his journey-sheets—he might have had 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about him of his own, and in remitting the last amount from Hull he might have mixed it up with his own money—I never spoke to him on the subject—I suppose ours is a large business.</p>

I am the senior partner in the firm—the prisoner at times accounted to me as well as to my son—if I and my son, who has been examined, were absent, my other son might have received money from the prisoner, but I know of no instance in which be ever did—on the first of these three journeys he accounted to me, and handed over the balance of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to his own salary account, as will appear by the cash-book—on his second journey he remitted more from Hull than he had charged himself with as having received—he stated, when we were balancing the account, that that had better go to the next journey account—I went and saw him on 28th March, at Adelaide-road, when I received the 55<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. brought by the wife—he said then that he was suffering from an attack of bronchitis—I went there knowing that he was ill—I think the conversation was almost exclusively confined to the state of his health, and I recommended him to stay indoors, and not to come down to the factory till the Monday following—I do not think anything passed about the accounts then—he gave me his book on that Saturday, and on my return to the counting-house I looked to see whether the account there corresponded with the account which we had in our book—I found that there was a difference, and that there was a much larger balance due than there ought to have been on the journey—I wrote to him on the subject and had my note posted—I saw him on the Tuesday after; as I wan going by the train, I was much surprised to see him at the Kingsland-station—I said, "I am going to call on you"—he told me that he had been down into Essex to see a relative of his wife's, and I said, "Then you have not received the letter I wrote to you, if you went on Saturday?"—he said, "No"—I said, "It is a matter of some importance, and I will not go in with you now, but I will make a call, and come and see you in half an hour's time or so," in order that he might have an opportu<lb/>nity of reading the letter—on my return I told him that if he was unable to pay the balance of that account, e had better pay me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at once—he paid me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said he would make it all right if I would let him go out on his journey—I said that I could not do that till it was satisfactorily explained to me what he had done with the money—I told him that if he would give me a true account of what had become of the money by Friday, I would wait until then, and he could communicate with his friends, if he chose—he did not do so on the Friday, and I then went up to Adelaide-road again, and found that he had left—the lady there gave me the address where she thought he would be found, and I went to Queen's-road, Dalston, but failed to see him—I did not see him again, I think, until to-day—120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd was the amount due on that journey—it was reduced by 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he paid me, and by another 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he subsequently sent down by letter, but no part of the 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. has been paid—the 41<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has not been paid to us in any shape, nor the 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. De Forges—the 88<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. is entirely from the last journey.</p>

I am the sister of Andrew Hart, and live at 2, Commercial-road, Pimlico—in October, 1861, I was married to the prisoner, at St. Peter's Church, Pimlico—previous to our marriage I had spoken to him about his being a married man, and he said he was not married—I was eighteen when I was married, and have since had a child—I lived with the prisoner till the beginning of April this year.</p>

She was drunk. I went away to get a pot of beer for dinner; I came home at 9 o'clock at night; she wasn't there. A little boy gave me a letter from her, in which she said I was to write off and tell her father that she was off to Scotland, and he would never see her any more. I wrote to her father, and told him so. That is the last time I saw her."</p>

               <p>reached me, I caused a tierce of salmon to be opened in the warehouse, and in the evening after the place was closed and all the men had gone, I went into the warehouse and counted the salmon that remained in the tierce—there were thirty-one—I marked each of them—the prisoners were in our service—they came to the premises on Tuesday morning, 3d March—on that day I went with Hyams to examine some salmon that had been left with Hannah to mind—I there saw three of the salmon that I had previously seen in the tierce—they had the mark on them which I had made—I then went back, and found that three more were gone—Hannah made a statement in my presence—I sent for Simpson, and asked him about the salmon—he said he knew nothing about them—Smith came in just afterwards, and I asked him about them—he looked rather confused, and said he knew nothing at all about them—I told them they had been in the warehouse that morning—they did not deny it—it was part of their business to bring fish in baskets to and from the warehouse.</p>

               <p>the green oil-silk and some catheters, about two dozen, which he said was a sample of what he had bought of the Frenchman—he never told me the name of the person of whom he bought them; he said he did not know it, or the address—on the evening of the inquiry at the police-court I went to his house to fetch something, and I saw him and his wife, and I saw Mrs. Pettit come to the door—I took the prisoner into custody after the trial last session, and after taking him to the station, I, accompanied by Mr. Jonas Laing, the prosecutor's brother, went to the prisoner's place to search it, and found all this property (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), the whole of which was identified; here are 29 trusses, 37 dozen bougies, 39 dozen catheters, 3 dozen urinals, 21 cupping bottles, 24 pairs of cotton surgical stockings, 15 pairs of silk stock<lb/>ings, 2 pieces of green silk, 6 1/2 lbs. of gutta percha tissue, and one piece of silk netting—some were in the workshop up stairs, and some in the shop; the trusses were in the sitting-room—I asked the prisoner on the first occa<lb/>sion what property he had, and he said he had none except the oil-silk and the catheters—I asked what he gave the Frenchman for the oil-silk; I am not certain whether he said 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the piece—I think Mr. Laing said, "You know that was under the price"—he said to me, "Oh!

               <p>times with Pettit, I may have five, six, or seven times—he came once and asked if he could speak to Pettit—Pettit asked my leave to go out, and they walked out together—Pettit once brought me some French stamps, and said that he could not get rid of them—I said, "I will give you 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for twenty, and then you will not lose by them"—that was the only transaction I had with Bruneau—when I went with the prisoner, I did not see any invoices—I did not claim some teats, I said that they looked very much like mine, but I did not say that they were mine, or I would have taken them—he showed me the invoice for those—I did not ask for any—he brought it to show it to the detective—I do not know that Mr. Wolloms was angry with me for coming to his shop; he was very polite so far, that he said that he was very sorry for what had happened—he might have said that I would buy stolen goods of anybody, if I had the chance, but I did not hear it; if I had, I would have spoken to him on the subject—there has been no quarrel between me and the prisoner—I never saw him on the subject—all I know of him is, he used to go in the country and sell goods at half-price—I remember a journey down to Manchester to a sale; my brother went down; it is three or four years ago—my brother and the prisoner were both bidders at that sale—I do not know of any quarrel there—the prisoner has carried on business as a surgical-instrument maker in Tottenham-court-road about four years, it may be more or less; my brother is here—I accuse Falleau of nothing at present—he left my service at the end of November—I keep books, but not for Falleau's affairs, nor for the reception of stock into my premises; only for goods that are sold out, and for the purchases on credit—I have not got my book here, but my place of business is only two minutes' walk from here—it is a waste-book, which my clerk keeps for his cash—it does not show the price I pay for articles at 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I cannot buy trusses of the small dealers—I swear that Falleau has not come and offered trusses of this description since he has left me—I never knew that he worked for the prisoner as well as for me—there is no manufacture of any kind carried on on my premises now; there was fifteen or eighteen mouths ago—we manufacture abroad; but I do not wish to open all my business to the Court and learn it to everybody—my brother sometimes makes a few of these urinals in Paris; his place is 12, Rue de le Cliquet—they are not very common—I have no private mark on them—they came from a house in Paris, and my brother may have made them himself—he makes some, and I buy some similar from another maker in Paris—I could prove all these things if the maker was here—the red bougies and the urinal with the private mark are the only things I can speak to positively, but there are plenty of people here who can speak to the other things—the private mark is R H; that is written by my brother, who is here—nobody else has got this green oiled-silk, and we missed it all at once—a man in Paris makes it exclusively for me, and this yellow silk also.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you positively identify that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; but I do the trusses; they are what the man made on my premises—if Falleau had made one before he came into my service that would not present the same appear<lb/>ance—I gave him a pattern of my own to make four different trusses—if he has made any since he left me, I cannot swear to them; it is only by their being his make, and by my missing them, that I know them—Hann came to my brother and said that he had taken one of our men in custody—I had often said to the man who is convicted, "I cannot make out what becomes of the bougies and catheters, we do not sell many"—I had not made any</p>

               <p>application to the police—I have no stock-book, but I easily miss things when they are made for me—I have a book which I can compare with my invoices—I have not taken the trouble to compare them, but I have cast it up in a rough way—I have had no notice to produce my books; besides, I do not think it is fair—I have not been informed that I was to produce them.</p>

                  </hi>. I was apprenticed to the prisoner, and worked at his shop—I went to him first on 1st September, I believe it was 1860, to learn the trade of a surgical-instrument maker—the prisoner had a work-shop, but he did not teach me to make articles there, though there was work going on—he discharged all the workmen except his own brother at Christ<lb/>mas, 1860—I very often saw Bruneau there—I have identified him in Holloway Prison—the first time I saw him at the prisoner's shop was twelve or fourteen months ago—the first goods that I saw him bring were some elastic stockings—the prisoner bought them of him, but did not ask his name or address—I do not remember how much he gave for them—after that, he came very frequently—at the beginning of this year he sometimes came twice a day, and sometimes only two or three times a week—he always brought goods with him; elastic stockings, knee-caps, anklets, catheters, bougies, and French urinals—he generally came in the afternoon, but some<lb/>times in the evening—I have seen him bring yellow silk like this—this continued till his arrest—I did not know his name till I saw it in the paper—he always passed at the shop as The Frenchman—when he brought the things, either Mr. or Mrs. Wolloms received them, and I have seen them paid for—12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross was paid for bougies—I should think the least that the same kind of bougies could be got for would be 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a gross—I have seen the prisoner give 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pair for cotton elastic stockings, and silk 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I saw these red bougies lying on the desk or table in the shop-parlour—the Frenchman had been there half an hour before, but I was ordered out of the shop when he came in—that was about six weeks before the men were taken—I was sent up stairs when he walked in, and was up stairs for twenty minutes—when I came down he was gone, and the bougies</p>

               <p>were lying there; I had not seen them before he came—I was frequently present when he first came—I was first sent out about two weeks before the men were taken; that was the first time that I noticed it, and after that I was generally sent out—for a month previous to the arrest I was always sent out when the Frenchman came—I had a pocket-book, in which I made memorandums of the goods bought of Bruneau a week previous to 31st January—I remember writing in my pocket-book one evening when my mistress was there, and I went out and left the book on the kitchen table—I found it still lying there when I returned; but after I had been in bed some time I heard my bedroom door open, and saw the prisoner walk in; he came to the side of the bed where my clothes were lying, took my trousers and went outside the room-door, which he pulled to after him, I then heard him tearing over the leaves of a book, and afterwards tearing up paper—he then brought my trousers back and placed them where he took them from; that was on 31st January—on examining my pocket-book, I found that the leaf containing the memorandums about the goods bought of Bruneau was torn out—I had not been writing in the pocket-book; I took it out to take out a pencil, and that leaf was there then—I had made six entries in it, one for every day in the week, from Monday to Saturday—I remember there were bougies put down, and oiled-silk, with 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. put to it—I believe that was for two pieces of this green; but I will not be certain whether it was two pieces or one piece—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the pocket-book—here is where the leaf was torn out, the last leaf—I gave this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) to the officer—I tore it from the wrapper of a gross of bougies which the prisoner bought of Bruneau for 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., five or six weeks before the men were taken; it is still in the same state, except that it is a little torn—I saw that there was writing on it, that caused me to tear it off—during the first twelve or eighteen months after I went there, Falleau used to come very often, but for eighteen months previous to November we had not seen him—he used also to bring goods—the last time he was there he brought two enemas, a parcel of trusses, a quantity of silk webbing, and some buckles—I have seen a person named Gregory there—Mrs. Wolloms gave 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for three enemas—Mr. Wolloms was in the country.</p>

               <p>and then the prisoner endeavoured to charge me with it—this was Saturday night, and he told the inspector to lock me up till Monday, but the inspector would not—Hunter said this directly he was charged in the shop parlour—I did not say that Hunter did not charge me with giving it to him; you asked me if he said that I gave him the catheter—Hunter admitted selling a silver catheter to a silversmith in Holborn, but until then I knew nothing about it—it was immediately after Hunter accused me of this—I was prevented being in the shop by myself—the principal part of the stock was kept in the shop—I lived with the prisoner till he was taken in custody, and on the day that he was first brought up at Guildhall, I was fetched away by a policeman named White—I have been living with the officer Hann ever since—I have two or three uncles alive, they did not refuse to have anything to do with me after Hunter was taken—I was with my uncle last night at his house in Bloomsbury square—the uncle who had previously supplied me with clothes, has not since refused to have anything to say to me—he has supplied me from that time, and did so last week, at least his wife has by his direction—I have not applied to the prisoner since that for clothes, on the ground that my uncle will no longer supply me—the prisoner gave me one pair of boots at Christmas—I wrote these things in my pocket-book, because the prisoner bought them so cheap of Bruneau, that I felt convinced they must be stolen or not paid for—I believe there were six memorandums in the book—they were all on one page—to the best of my recollection, I did not tear any leaf out of my pocket-book—the first time I communicated with the police was on 1st March, I think—I should not like to swear that I did not tear out a leaf for the purpose of a memorandum—I only miss one leaf, and that is the last—I believe one side of it was red, like the colour of the book—the memorandums I made were only one side, but I cannot swear that it was not white on both sides, or it might have been marble on one side.</p>

I immediately took it out of my pocket, and gave it to him; he said, "It is broken;" I said, "I don't know anything about that," and he gave me in custody. He can't swear I am the party who stole the watch, and yet I am indicted for stealing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a midshipman belonging to the Peruvian Corvette <hi rend="italic">Arica</hi>—on Thursday night, 20th March, I was officer of the watch on board the <hi rend="italic">Venus</hi> hulk—it is the practice to have twenty-four hour watch for each officer—I had commenced my watch at 8 o'clock that morning—some of the soldiers were allowed leave on shore that day; I don't remember how many—the prisoner was not one of them—two of them returned to the ship about 11 o'clock—about 11 o'clock I found the soldiers in their berths with lights, playing cards; two of them were quarelling—Cabaro, the sergeant on guard, went below with me—I desired him to put one of those who were quarrelling into confinement, which was done—one of the soldiers took up a bayonet—after they mutinied, I went into my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> in to get my sword—when I returned with it, I found Perez, Mango, Mesa, and another one quarrelling, and I went with my sword in my hand to stop the quarrel; the soldiers had bayonets at this time—I then went and gave in a report to the officer in command—the Commander-in-chief was not on board—I came back between decks with the officer in charge—Perez and Mesa told us they were going ashore by force or by goodness; it was Perez that spoke—the sailors were then all asleep in their berths—they were called up after the soldiers went to their arms—that was about an hour after the row began, we could not keep the soldiers below, they got up between decks and took the arms from the armoury, all the lot—the armoury is between decks—I did not lock the armoury: I put a sentinel there—shots were fired at this time; when they wanted to come up, the sailors and the officers stopped them—Sergeant Vargas was the first that fired—the shots were fired at the sailors from below—the sailors got their arms—this state of things continued till half-past 12 o'clock—the soldiers afterwards came up between decks—the sailors were keeping the hold to prevent the soldiers from coming up—they got up through a hole in the fore part of the vessel—after the sailors retired from between decks, the soldiers came up through all the holes.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. DALEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Who came and attacked them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The first was Sergeant Vargas, Corporal Mango, Corporal Mesa, Perez, and other soldiers—they got up the fore-hatchway—upon that, six of the sailors retired to the upper part of the deck, and the others ran away to other parts of the vessel—the soldiers then got possession of the main deck, and they fought on the deck—Oliva was in the bottom part of the vessel, but he was taken out of there and armed; the others let him out, I don't know who they were—Oliva was the man that was put in confinement at first—when I saw him up he was armed—I only saw him when the soldiers came between decks—I recollect an attack on midshipman Iladoi—Perez was there then—Mess, Oliva, Callejas, and Mango—Callejas was between decks with Perez, Iladoi, and all the others—I did not see Callejas stabbed—Oliva was sober as far as I could tell.</p>

I live at 36, Goswell-street, Clerken well, and am a traveller—on 9th March, about 7 o'clock, I was in Mr. Martin's shop; he said, "For God's sake run out"—I did so, and saw the four prisoners at the window—they saw me, and ran away—I followed them 150 yards, hallooing, "Stop thief"—they turned the bottom of Royal-hill, and when they had got twenty yards they all stopped, and passed the booty to one of them—I cannot tell which—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at one of them—he attempted to strike me, but I let go, and bobbed down—I do not know which that was, it was so dark—I know they are the same men, because I never lost sight of them—I saw Turtle throw the watches away at one of the houses, Mr. Collins, I believe—as he did so, he said, "There is another b—y watch"—I made a <hi rend="italic">grab</hi> at two of the prisoners, but it was dark, and I could not say which—a person took them from me.</p>

He said, "My wife has got a watch, if you know anybody that wants to buy a watch, she wants you to sell this watch." Mr. Good<lb/>child had been speaking to me about this Mr. Smith that wanted a watch, and I said to Goodchild that day, "I think I have a watch that will suit that person you were telling me about." I went home early that afternoon, went to Mr. Smith's house, and asked him if he was in want of a watch. He said, "Yes, I am." I said, "Well, I am going home, and I will bring it round in an hour to you" When I went up stairs this Ann Davis was in my place talking to my wife. She said, "Mr. Wood, I have been waiting for you, for I have got a watch I want you to sell, if you can." I said, "I have been asked for a watch, and, if you like, I will take it round before I have my tea. I took it to Mr. Smith, and he gave me 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it, which I brought back and gave to Ann Davis, and she went away. That is the whole truth. As regards the tickets, Mr. Smith came to my place, I think, on the 16th, on a Monday; Goodchild was in the room. Smith said he had been given to understand that this watch was stolen. I said, "No; I can't believe." At this time I had the tickets of the property, which turns out to belong to this other burglary. If I had known them to belong to that other burglary, should I not have burnt them instead of keeping them from the Monday till the Thursday, when the policeman came. If I had known myself to be guilty, I had plenty of time to abscond.</p>

I live at the Prince Alfred beer-house, Cornwall-road, Brixton—on Wednesday, 14th February, the prisoner came to my house and asked for a glass of ale, and put down a two-shilling piece—I saw it was bad, and told her so—she said, "Is it?" and I said, "Yes, it is a very bad one"—she took it and bit it, and said, "Oh, dear me, it is a bad one"—I said, "Do you know where you took it?"—she said, "Yes, she had changed a five-shilling piece"—I gave it her back—I thought she was a person in the neighbourhood, as she had been to my house before—she then paid me with a good half-crown, and went away with the bad florin—she had given me two-shilling pieces before.</p>
