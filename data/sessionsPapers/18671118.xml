I am assistant to Mr. Attenborough, pawnbroker, of 32, Strand—on this Friday the prisoner came to our shop and produced this ring—he asked me the value of it—I asked him who it belonged to, and he declined to say—he said, "I simply want to know the value of the ring," and he did not think we were gutting a proper question to him—I had previously had some description Of the ring—I called in Mr. Steadman and said, "Is that the gentleman it belongs to?" and he said, "Yes, it is"—nothing further took place—he was given into custody.</p>

I am assistant to John Augustus Nicolay, a furrier, of 82, Oxford Street—in September, 1865, this letter was handed to me; I read it in a hurry, and selected four or five sealskin cloaks, which I took to 17, St. Petersburg Place, Bayswater—some one, who appeared to be a servant, received the goods from me; she had rather a sallow complexion, dark hair, and a cast in one of her eyes—she took the goods into another room, and in a short time brought back four of them, keeping a circular cloak, value eighteen guineas.</p>

I live at 5, Bedford Place, Rotherhithe—I first knew the prisoner at Binfield Place, Clapham, as Mrs. Somerset, and as Mrs. Morris at the same time—I knew Louisa Frost and Miss Bristowe, who lived with her as servants—Mrs. Frost had one of her eyes fixed, she was lady's maid to the prisoner, and lived with her—she was tall, and her complexion was dark—she lived with the prisoner from December, 1864, to June or July, 1865—I have seen the prisoner write; this letter is her writing, to the best of my belief.</p>

I should not answer in the affirmative—I will swear that I do not believe it is Frost's—I have known the prisoner as Mrs. Somerset since December, 1864—I have heard of her for a great</p>

I am the wife of Henry Keene, and am assistant to Michael Myers, a trunkmaker, of 27, Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square—on 27th May the prisoner called in a brougham—I went down to it, and she asked me to let her see some ladies' travelling dress-trunks—I asked her if I should bring them to the carriage—she said yes, as she was such a very great invalid she could not get out—I took some trunks down to her with the porter's assistance, and she selected two, but she required some alterations in them, and the letter "H" painted on them very large, as her Christian name was Harriet—I was to send a receipted bill, as they would be paid for on delivery—she gave her name, Mrs. Frazer, The Cottage, Hampstead, and drove away—on 29th May a tall woman calling herself Mrs. Frazer's maid drove up in the brougham—she had a defect in one of her eyes—she gave me this card (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with "Mrs. Frazer" on it—she said that Mrs. Frazer sent</p>

               <p>that card, and asked if we would lend her one of our travelling trunks until her own was finished, as she was called out of town unexpectedly—I lent her one, value three guineas—her boxes were to be sent home on the Friday, and this was to be returned—I gave her boxes, with "H" on them, to the porter on the Friday, and the receipted bill—he carried them away and brought them back the same day—I did not see the prisoner again until she was in custody—I heard no tidings of her or of the trunk—I identified a box which was shown to me at Marlborough Street,</p>

                  </hi>. I am a capmaker, of 46, Cannon Street, St. George's-in-the-East—on 3rd November I shut up my house—the doors and windows were safe at 11.30—I was awoke at twenty minutes to three by my servant crying, "Master, master, get up; there are burglars"—I opened the front window and called "Police"—I opened my bedroom door, and found that other doors were open—one of two boxes was broken open, and the things strewed about the room, the window of which was open—I looked out and saw one of the prisoners descending a ladder—I went down stairs, opened the middle room door and the shop door, and found Mahoney in custody in the street, next door to my house—the second box had been tried to be forced, but they had not succeeded.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Were any of the things taken away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the top box had not been locked—the house has only one storey—the man I saw in custody was the one I saw going down the ladder, because he had a light coat on.</p>

               <p>Wellclose Square—I am over the whole of the fire offices in London—on 13th October, about twenty-five minutes to five, I went to these premises, went into the cellar, and noticed a quantity of smoke—I saw that some bung cloths had been burning, and some rum had been running from a cask—the bung cloths smelt strongly of rum—my attention was drawn to two packets of powder on some casks—I found 1lb. 6oz. in the two packets—this bag (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) had been exploded, so that I was obliged to take it out and put it into another paper—I picked up the packet with the name on it off the barrel; that had not exploded—the other, which had been exploded, was picked up afterwards; Sergeant Proctor gave it to me—the smell was like an explosion of powder—I went to the house between seven and eight in the evening, and asked the prisoner where he was insured—he said in the Royal Fire-office, for 550<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him how he accounted for the powder I being on the cask in the cellar below—he said that he could not account for it unless he had some friends about him who owed him a spite—I asked him what that hole in the bagatelle-room was, near the bagatelle board—he said that they must have come in from the back entrance, and gone down that hole into the cellar—I asked him how much rum he thought he had in his cask—he said that he thought it was about half full—I said, "That will be for you and the surveyor to settle in the morning"—I told him I would leave a man all night for safety, and if he heard of anything to let me know—he said that his wife had gone to Stratford, some of his children were at school and some at church, and that when he left the house there was no one there at all—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some of the bung cloths, more than an ordinary tub full were picked up and put in a tap-tub, more than thirty—I did not see them till they were in the tub—pieces of paper were mixed with them, as there are with this; they were wet with rum and water.</p>

Tucker and Forman, of Chard, and had the papers sent there—I also wrote to them to see what could be done, and got this letter from them, which I believe I showed the prisoner, to show him that I could not be made safe—I then received this letter from the prisoner, it is written by him. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 30th August, 1867, from the prisoner to Mr. M. T.

                  </hi>. I am the wife of John Gethin Bartlett—I remember his receiving a power of attorney—I cannot remember the date, but Thursday, to the best of my knowledge—I saw the prisoner on that day—I was in and out of the bar parlour all the time he was there—when this paper came by post ray husband looked at it and told me it would have to be witnessed—I cannot remember all that was said, as I never expected to hear any more about it—I said to the prisoner, "Mr. Turvey has agreed to be the witness;" as near as I can remember, he asked who Mr. Turvey was, and I told him a grocer—I had spoken to Mr. Turvey in consequence of a communication between me and my husband—when the prisoner came the prisoner asked me if Mr. Turvey was handy—I said that I knew; he was not, for he had gone up the road with his cart—he said, "He will have to sign his name"—I said, "He cannot do that, for he cannot write"—the prisoner said that it was only a form, and if I put Mr. Turvey's name that would do just as well as sending it to his house—I, then put Mr. Turvey's name on the paper as a witness—this, "William Turvey,† grocer, 24, Custom House Terrace, North Woolwich Road," is my writing—the prisoner said that he was going to Red Hill to get it signed by my husband's brother—I do not remember any other signature—my husband wrote his name first, and I wrote this afterwards, and after the prisoner had had some refreshment he put the paper in his pocket and went away with it—the prisoner tried to induce my husband to sign his brother's name here, and said that, as he had signed in the Bank books, there would be no more harm in his doing so—he did not do so—it was after that that he said he would take it to Red Hill—I did not read the power—I do not know what is in it even now—I remember the Saturday when my husband came from London with the prisoner—he was not there very long—on the same evening my husband gave him two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England notes—I went to Stratford the same evening and paid them to Mr. Elphick.</p>

Q.</hi> When did you see Mr. Matthew after that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till I saw him the other day—I do not remember that he was angry: I am very angry now to be placed in such a position—I was not very much afraid my husband was going to be prosecuted, because I knew he had done no wrong—he did not tell me that he was afraid, or that he expected to be prosecuted—Mr. Matthew did not appear angry to me, but I had never seen him before in ray life; we never invited him to the wedding and I never saw him, but he has behaved very kind to my husband—I saw him when he came in, but do not know that he was angry—I was—I wrote the name of Turvey at Mr. Hill's instigation—he is an educated man, and I am not educated at all—I did not think it wrong to write another person's name—I believe Mr. Turvey is here; my husband did not see him—he does not get up so early in the morning, and Turvey was out with his cart in the next street when I went to look for him—I did not know any other respectable man who was a householder—I just glanced at the paper, but did not read</p>

               <p>any part of it; my husband did not tell me anything—he looked at it and said, "This paper will have to be witnessed"—I did not think any fraud was contemplated—I only wrote in one place—I believe this John Gethin Bart<lb/>lett, on the other side, to be my husband's writing, it looks very much like it—I did not write this "Henry Smith," and do not know anything about it; I have not seen it before, and if you look at that William Turvey, you will see that this is not my writing—I can read—I do not know whose writing this Matthew Thomas Bartlett is, I am sure it is not my husband's, because it was not on the paper when it went from our house—I have nothing to do with the other signatures, they were not on the paper when it left our house—this is certainly not my husband's writing—I am sure this Smith is not my writing, I think Mr. Hill has placed us all in this position—I was not called before the Magistrate and should not have come had I not been subpoenaed—ray evidence was not taken in writing before a Magistrate, only at Mr. Freshfield's office a week or a fortnight ago—I did not take particular notice of the date—they wrote to me to come up to their office, and I went—it is rather over a week I think since I was subpoenaed—I did not read this paper over—my husband did not tell me to ask Turvey for his authority, but Mr. Hill did—I had asked Turvey's permission, but Mr. Hill told me where to sign Mr. Turvey's name—it was my husband who told me to ask Mr. Turvey, not Mr. Hill.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Irving and Slade, stockbrokers, of Copthall Court, Throgmorton Street—I first saw the prisoner at the end of September, between the 24th and the 27th—I heard a person talking to a clerk in the outer office—I saw him, and he said that he required a power of attorney—he spoke about transferring stock which stood in two names; I said that it would be necessary for the persons in whose name the stock stood to attend at the Bank of England, or to give a power of attorney—he called again on or about 30th September, and I received his instructions for a power of attorney, took them down in writing, and he signed them; this is the paper I wrote. (<hi rend="italic">This was an instruction for a power of attorney to sell</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">stock, from</hi> 662<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—<hi rend="italic">Signed E.

               <p>necessary to pay an extra fee—I believe he said that it was of no import<lb/>ance, or that there was no hurry for the money—I said that, as we were not acquainted with Mr. John Gethin Bartlett, it would be necessary that he should be identified by some one we knew, or by some respectable person in the City; he said that that would not be difficult, as Mr. Bartlett had lived in the City ten or eleven years, and an appointment was made for Saturday—he came on the Saturday, and said, "I have Mr. Bartlett out<lb/>side in a cab; you said that it would be necessary to have him identified; can you or one of your firm go with me to Newgate Street to have him identified?"—I said, "I dare say my partner will go; he is out on busi<lb/>ness," and the prisoner stayed till Mr. Irving returned—while he was waiting I put forward the ticket to the Bank of England, and instructed them to make the transfer; they made no objection—I went to the Bank, and saw the purchase of the stock, and the sale was concluded—I drew this cheque (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) and handed it to Mr. Irving.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Mr. Slade's partner—I returned to town on 3rd October, and saw the prisoner on the 4th I believe—there was some question about the description in the Bank books; he gave me a wrong description, and I told him I could not find the account—I re<lb/>ceived back the ticket of instructions when he called on the 4th, 6th, or 7th, and told him that the description differed in the Bank books, and he must give me a different description; he did so, he brought it written on the back of a letter, which he handed to me, and I forwarded it to the Bank of England, and afterwards received it back again—two or three applications were made to the Bank—they returned it twice.</p>

               <p>saw him sign his name—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is his signature, to the best of my belief—it was not my duty to witness the signature, only to identify him—there is no question about it being his signature—Mr. Slade then handed the prisoner this cheque for 92<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. odd—we always have our cheques printed crossed—the prisoner asked me to make it "Pay cash," and I did so—I was examined before the Magistrate.</p>

Freshfield, but I do not think they issue them entirely in blank; the attorney's name would be in blank, but the name of the person and the stock never is—when a power of attorney is given out and sent into the country, I am perfectly convinced that the head part is filled up, because we always make an entry in our books before we send a power away—the date would be left blank till the person signs it—the name of the person "John Gethin Bartlett" is filled in in the middle—the name of the attorney is left blank, it is filled up now—if not correctly described in the Bank books they would not issue the power.</p>

I am assistant at the Royal Standard—I saw the prisoners and a third man in the tap-room—I came out after Jackson's beer was put on the counter—I received a shilling from Mrs. Atkins, which I broke in three pieces; one piece was lost, and the other two I can swear to—I asked Jackson where he got the shilling—he said that he begged of a gentleman, who gave it to him—Hutton came out, and was given in custody—I put the two pieces of the shilling in my pocket, and then on the shelf—Hutton tried to get out—he went into the garden after the bad shilling was detected—I had no other piece of broken shilling in my pocket.</p>

He said, "I think it is the tall man who was sitting by the side of you," I said, "Indeed!" and afterwards they came and said that I was a connected party.
