                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Frederick Hart, a brandy-mer<lb/>chant, No. 64, Lower Thames-street. In Jan. last we had an order from a customer in the country for a cask of brandy, which order we executed on the 15th of Jan.—we employ Mr. Ayrst as a carrier to bring the brandy from the docks to our cellar, and afterwards to take it to the place to which it was to be sent—Scott was the carman of Mr. Ayrst—the brandy is brought from the docks to our door, to be sampled—the instructions were given to Ayrst to fetch the brandy—I did not give them—I afterwards saw Scott on the pre<lb/>mises—I did not see the sample taken from the brandy; that was the duty of Smith, the cellarman—I did not see the brandy go from the premises—I know it was at the door—I did not examine the cask till the following morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carrier; Scott was in my employ in Jan last. In the course of that month I received an order from Mr. Hart to bring some brandy from the docks to his door, and then to the docks again, to go to Newark—I employed Scott on that occasion—I saw the hogshead of brandy in the cart some time after it came from the docks—Scott was then with it—another of my men was standing close by the cart, but Scott was in charge of it—I did not examine the cask to see if there were any holes in it—Scott was standing by the side of the cart for some little time after it came from the dock, until the cask was sampled, and the order given to take it away to its destination—it was sampled at Mr. Hart's door.</p>

On the night of the 15th of Jan., about seven o'clock, I saw a cart in Lower Thames-street—Scott was with it, and Edward Dawson was with him—Lower Thames-street is in a direction between Mr. Hart's and Jolly's warehouse—when I first saw them the cart was standing at Mr. Hart's door—Dawson was not speaking to Scott against the door, but some short distance away from it—I watched the cart when it went on, and Scott with it—I did not see Edward Dawson then—I went round and met the cart at the top of Fish-street-hill—Scott was then in the cart, driving, and another man was sitting down in the bottom of the cart, who turned out to be James Dawson, who is the father of Edward—I followed the cart into Lombard-street—I stopped there for a moment, and Edward Dawson came past me—he was going in the same direction as the cart was going—it was then on ahead—he saw me, and turned in a different road—I stopped and searched him, but found nothing on him—he then went away—I followed the cart into London-wall—I there got another officer, went and stopped the cart, and got up into it—Scott and James Dawson were then in the cart—I found in it a hogshead of brandy and a pipe of wine—I asked them what they had got there—they made no reply—I felt towards the top part of the cart, and there found a wooden spile, or peg, in the cask of brandy—I felt down towards the bottom of the cart, and found this bladder of brandy lying in the bottom of the cart, and this tin pipe was in a hole that was made in the brandy-cask—it was necessary that there should be a hole at the top of the cask, to give it vent—I then told Scott to drive to the sta<lb/>tion, which he did—I there searched him, and found this hammer in his pocket—Scott said, "I have only got this hammer; it belongs to him," pointing to James Dawson—Dawson could hear that—he said nothing to it—I afterwards went back to the place where I had stopped the cart—I searched about there, and found these two gimlets in the road, and these four wooden spiles—one gimlet is large, and the other small—the large one is about the size of the tin tube that fits the bladder, and the small one is the size of the place where the spile was—I compared the two with the two holes, and found them to correspond—I afterwards showed the same cask to Vale—I had seen Edward Dawson that day, but not in company with Scott—it was about the middle of the day.</p>

I live at No. 49, Bishopsgate-street; my wine-cellars are in Sweetland-court, under a house which the prisoner occupied under me for some time; he was to leave on the Saturday previous to the robbery.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020010"/>
               <p>I found one board taken up, and space enough for a man's arm to go into the cellar—there was a bin just under the closet, containing pint bottles of port wine—I miss eighteen bottles from that bin—I went up stairs with my cellarman, and found the prisoner in the top room—he was without his coat, and his shirt sleeves were tucked up—I asked what he was doing there, as he ought to have left on the Saturday—he said he was merely removing a few things—I afterwards went to the prisoner's lodging, in Worship-street—the policeman and my man were there before me—when I arrived the officer pointed out to me five pint bottles, and a hole in the ceiling, from whence he had taken them—four of those I feel confident I can swear to—they had contained port wine—they were wet, and three, if not four of them had the corks forced in, evidently with the thumb, instead of being drawn with a screw, similar to the bottle found in the closet—these are the bottles—I have no doubt they were such as had been in my port wine bin—I have no pecu<lb/>liar mode of corking my bottles—I speak to them from comparing the crust and the smell, the chalk and dirt marks, and I compared them with those left behind, and they corresponded—the wine had been about three years in bin.</p>

               <p>half-past four in the afternoon, I went with Brannan, Cole, and two other officers, to a house in John's-buildings, St. Ann-street, Westminster—I tried the door, and could not open it—I consider it was locked—I then forced it open, with the assistance of the other officers—the house consists of two rooms—we went to the upstairs room, and found that door fast—I found it was fastened with this wooden cross-bar across the door—this larpe piece of timber about eight feet long was fitted into it, and went in a slanting direction to the wall—the door was broken open by Brannan with a sledge-hammer—as soon as a piece of the door was knocked out I had a full view of the room—I saw Thomas Russell throw a quantity of shillings into a large clear fire—I could see they were shillings—the pri<lb/>soners were in the room—Ann Russell had a mould in her hand at the time, which she put into a pail of water in front of the fire and squeezed it—the door then came in, and we rushed in—I put my hand into the pail of water and took out a shilling, and some plaster of Paris which she had in her hand—I then commenced searching the room—under the bed by the I found a paper parcel containing plaster of Paris in powder, and this knife on the floor close to the fire with plaster of Paris on it—on a kind of dresser<lb/>shelf I found this galvanic battery in a jar containing fluid, which in the affray was accidentally upset—I had it in my hand before it was shirt, and it was quite full—the male prisoners had their coats off, and their shirt sleeves rolled up—I did not see Scott till I entered the room—he was in the corner of the room where the bed was—when I entered, Thomas Russell was Just in front of the fire, and Scott was in a kind of place where the bed was—Russell had a handkerchief tied round his head—I ascertained the state of the door after I got in—I produce the things I found.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Batter, a tobacconist, in Cheapside. On the 6th of Jan., between two and three o'clock, I was minding the shop—the prisoner came in (there was a gentle<lb/>man sitting at the end of the shop, smoking a cigar, during the whole transaction, but he did not leave his seat) the prisoner asked for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., worth of cheroots—I served him, and he laid down a good sovereign to pay for them—I proceeded to give him change—I had three half-sovereigns in a little box in a drawer behind the counter—there was no other coin there—I had seen the three half-sovereigns there at eleven o'clock that morning—I took them out to see how many there were, and saw they were all good—I am quite certain of that—I laid the prisoner down one of those half-sovereigns—he could see me open the box, and that there were more half-sovereigns there—I proceeded to get some silver—I saw him take up the half-sovereign which I put down</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020021"/>
               <p>—he said, "I wish you would oblige me by changing this, for it looks as if it was light"—I took it from him, and put it into the little box on the top of his sovereign, which I had put into the box—I did not examine it to see if it was the same I had given him—I gave him another half-sovereign in ex<lb/>change, which I also took out of the box—he took it up, then laid down an<lb/>other half-sovereign, and said, "Will you oblige me with all silver for this? I had rather not have any gold at all"—I noticed it, and saw it was a bad one, and am quite sure it was not the one I had given him—I then looked into the box, and found the one on the top of the sovereign as I had placed it, and that was bad—it could not have been the one I had first given him—on finding them both bad, I walked round the counter, shut the shop door, told him he had given me two bad half-sovereigns, and demanded the half-sovereigns of him which I had given him—when I went to the door I had laid the one he last gave me on the glass case on the counter—he stood close to the glass case, leaning against it, and within reach of the half-sovereign—my eyes were off him while I was looking at the first bad half-sovereign—(I had it in my hand at the door)—he said he had no half-sovereign at all about him—that he had had nothing but the sovereign in his pocket—I asked him for the half-sovereign I had given him at first—he said he had no half-sovereign at all about him, that the one I gave him first was the one he gave me back, but when I called the policeman in he said, "Here is the half-sovereign you gave me first," and produced one—that was after he had de<lb/>nied having any about him—I took possession of it, and put it into the box—it is here to-day—I afterwards went to the glass case where I had placed the one he gave me last—it was not there, and I have never found it—the pri<lb/>soner said nothing about it—the gentleman did not interfere it any way, or leave his seat—I gave the bad half-sovereign to the officer, and the good one too.</p>

Mr. Underwood had apartments there—Dowman was in my service, as housekeeper, for seven weeks or two months—she had the entire charge of the house, to wait on me and my lodgers—I did not know Smith till after this matter—I understand he passed as the husband of Dowman—I left town on the 24th of Dec., and returned on Monday, the 29th—Dowman had then left—Smith came to the house that afternoon, and I taxed him with being concerned in taking five or six bottles of wine—he denied it at first, and then said he had some wine which Dowman had given him to drink, and he imagined she had liberty to have it—I asked how much he had—he thought there might have been a bottle—I asked if he thought there were two—he said he did not think they had had two; he was sure they had not had three—I asked if he had four or five, and he acknowledged that he had had part of five with her—he had no business at my house—I cannot tell how he came there, but I had desired, if he came, that I should be called down to him—I saw nothing of Dowman till she was at the station—Smith acknowledged to me that he had been at my house from Saturday night till Monday morning, and that the whole of the wine was drank on the Sunday.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi>, on her voyage from Hong Kong—she belonged to Liverpool—I went out in her from Liverpool, and was an apprentice—the prisoner was the captain—the crew consisted of about twenty-seven on an average—the outward voyage was conducted in the usual way—nothing unpleasant arose, more than might be on any vessel—we left Hong Kong in May, 1845, to return to England—Thomas Rason was an able seaman on board—he joined her at Sincapore—William Henry Rambert was</p>

               <p>the mate, and William Mars the second mate—we had a very valuable cargo, principally tea—we did not touch at the Cape, nor at St. Helena—the wind was favourable shortly after we passed the Cape—we missed St. Helena.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was any reason given by the captain for that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He frequently told me he expected his chronometers were wrong, and he was out of his longitude—he asked the crew if they were agreeable to run into the island of Ascension, and they were agreeable—that would be a six days' run from where we were, on an average—our provisions and water were in a very low state indeed, when we missed St. Helena, and our allowance of water then was a quart a-day, (the usual allowance is from six pints to a gallon,) I was laid up ill, and did not hear the crew murmur about the short allowance, but I heard remarks made that the captain had some private reason for passing St. Helena—he did not succeed in making Ascension island, and he called the first and second mate down into the cabin, and consulted them whether it was best still to try to get to Ascension, or proceed on the voyage—it was agreed we should proceed—this was about the 19th or 20th of Sept.—(<hi rend="italic">look<lb/>ing at the log</hi>)—a day on board ship begins at noon—I occasionally acted as clerk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you at any time hear the crew state their inability to work on a quart of water a-day, without they had rest, watch and watch? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not hear it then, I heard it afterwards—the allowance of water was further dimi<lb/>nished, and came to a pint a-day, and half a pound of bread, and I believe at last there was none on board—that was soon after the captain determined to make for home—I find by the log that we fell in with a French barque, about eight in the morning of Tuesday, 23rd of May—the stock of bread was gone about that time—I heard of the mate Rambert jumping over<lb/>board—we went on pretty comfortable from that time, till we made the island of Fayal—we arrived there, by the log, on the 22nd Oct.—the captain went on shore there—I went with him, also Rason, Johnson, Thompson, Yelverton, and Slack, two apprentices—I cannot exactly say who else—there was a boat's crew—the captain returned on board the same evening, with those that went on shore with him—at that time the harbour-master of Fayal was on board—we had met him as we were pro<lb/>ceeding ashore, and the captain gave the ship into his charge, and he went on board—we found him on board when we returned—when the captain returned on board, I should say he was perfectly capable, that is, he was in his senses—he appeared to have been drinking slightly, but was not at all intoxicated, in my opinion—I should not wish to form an opinion as to his state of drunkenness, as the way he acted in some cases was so different to what you would think—he always appeared moved after the death of Ram<lb/>bert—he was given more to drinking—he was rather in a little drink when he went on shore, and when he came back about the same state, or perhaps a little worse—I was with him all the time he was on shore, except for about an hour and half, when he was with the English consul—whether they drank any wine I cannot say—I did not hear him say anything about it then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the 24th Oct. had you occasion to go down into the cap<lb/>tain's cabin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot speak to the date, but on the day Rason died—I was in the cabin when Rason was called down into the captain's cabin—it was nearly midnight—the captain had desired me to step into the cabin—the beginning of it was this, a charge was brought against Rason, by a man named Joseph Morris, of having said he would have law when he came to England, or words to that effect—he told the cap<lb/>tain Rason had said so, and the captain desired Rason to be sent for—he appeared to act on that—he might have some private motive—I be<lb/>lieve somebody was sent to call Rason down—he came down—Yelver<lb/>ton</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020029"/>
               <p>the apprentice, and Mr. Dunn, the cook, were also in the cabin, and, as far as I recollect, Julian Cordeviola—I should say the captain was more than half drunk—I had seen him drinking, in the course of the day, braiidy-and-water—I cannot say what quantity—to the best of my recollection, immedi<lb/>ately Rason name down, the captain took hold of him, and shook him on the sofa, or couch, where he desired him to sit, and struck him once with the bayonet on his side—with the point of the bayonet—I left before his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say anything to him on his first coming into the cabin? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I recollect his speaking to him, but cannot say the words—I think he called him a d—d mutineer—Rason did not answer at the time, as far as I recollect—the captain did not do anything more to him while I was there—I cannot exactly say where the captain got the bayonet from—there were bayonets always about the cabin at that time—I recollect his taking it up after Rason was in the cabin—whether it was given to him, or he took it off the table, I cannot recollect—I asked the captain's permission to go to the water-closet, and left the cabin—there was a boy named Glover on board—some short time after I left Glover came and called me—in consequence of what he said I went down into the cabin again—the captain was there, and Dunn, the cook; I do not think anybody else was there, but there might be—Rason was laid down alongside the sofa—Dunn informed me, the moment I went in, that Rason was dead—I did not believe it, but ascertained that it was true by feeling his face, which was cold—the captain was there—I cannot recollect whether he made any observation—he looked as if he was more in possession of his senses than he was previous to my leaving the cabin—he appeared quite calm and unmoved—the body of Rason was carried out of the cabin afterwards, and buried the following morning—I read the funeral service—this entry in the log-book, dated 24th Oct, is in my writing—I cannot say when I made it—I generally filled up the log at noon—when any of these circumstances happened on board I never made "the entry till the captain came into a calm mood, till scenes of strife were over—I should say the entry was made the day after the death—it is signed by the captain—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>—"Thomas Gair acknowledged to having come aft, armed with a handspike, by the direction of William Rambert. It was thought proper to put him with Thomas Mars and Lee, who appeared to have something further to do with the mutiny, in irons. Thomas Rason being ordered down to the captain in the presence of the un<lb/>dersigned, (who were all under arms at the time,) to answer for a further threat he had made, although about a few hours previous the captain had advised him to take care of himself, and not to attempt anything further; he appeared whilst under examination to be under a great state of excitement, which seemed highly suspicious, leaving us to judge that he had again been in the act of endeavouring to take the captain's life, if he should have the opportu<lb/>nity, and create a further mutiny; we the undersigned are sure, that if the captain's life was taken, that immediately afterwards they would take ours, and therefore used every precaution that we could. Thomas Rason, when leaving the cabin, after not being able to get any further evidence from him, took a fit; we endeavoured to restore animation by the usual means, but to no effect On Thomas Rason's entrance into the cabin the captain asked him what he was labouring under. Signed, <hi rend="smallCaps">G. JOHNSTON. A. G. SPENCE. ALEXANDER SINCLAIR. BARRY YELVERTON. R. FRENCH. HENRY SLACK. JAMES GLOVER. WILLIAM DUNN</hi>.") I made this entry at the captain's desire—when I came into the cabin, after being called by Glover, the captain told me Rason had died in a fit; and I heard Dunn, the cook, say so also—I think it was the day after the one Mars was committed to the deep, the captain desired me to say in the log-book that Rason had died in a fit, that he was taken in con<lb/> culsions</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020030"/>
               <p>and died in a fit—I did not take on myself to believe it—I judged how he had died, but I entered in the log-book what the captain desired me—I think these six names were put to it the day after Mars was committed to the deep—I signed it a short time after I made the entry—I believe it was at the time—I generally signed at the same time as them—when any particular transaction took place the captain signed in the log-book, also the chief and second officer, nobody else before Rambert's death—after his death some of the crew were called to sign it.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JARVIS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you sailed with Captain John<lb/>ston before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—this was the first long voyage I made—in the outward voyage nothing particular occurred—the greater part of the men we took in at Hong Kong were new—Rambert, the chief mate, was new—I cannot say how many new hands there were.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ascertain, or did the captain know, before Sept., that some of the hands had shipped under false names? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I heard nothing of some of them having left a vessel at Hong Kong on account of a mutiny—Rambert jumped overboard on the 25th or 26th of Sept.—I had not heard some days before that some of the crew told the captain there was to be a mutiny on board—I heard from Yelverton, when he was brought to the cap<lb/>tain, when near Ascension, that two of the crew had said before the morning the captain would be a dead man—I think that was more than two or three days before Rambert jumped overboard, I think not more—it might be four days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before that time had not the captain treated the whole crew with great kindness? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There was nothing very particular to complain of—Rambert, the mate, treated them unkindly, but the captain did not—before the state<lb/>ment of Yelverton to the captain he conducted himself quietly and tem<lb/>perately—he appeared to look after the interest of the owner and the interest of the ship as far as I saw, he was quiet and steady—the cargo was most valuable—the men grumbled about this time on account of the provisions—we were on short allowance—shortly after this communication from Yelverton I saw a difference in the captain's manner—he appeared very anxious, excitable, and nervous after that communication—he armed himself immediately after he heard that from Yelverton.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it after that you first imagine he had taken to drinking? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He was drinking previous to that, but not in that excitable way—he drank spirits—as soon as he heard this communication he was in a much more excitable state than he was previously—I was not present when he chased one of the crew round the deck with a cutlass in his hand—I was ill—I had broken the cap of my knee at the time Rambert jumped overboard—I heard Richard French make a communication to the captain about the state of the crew about three hours after Yelverton's statement—it was before Rambert jumped overboard—he told the captain part of the crew had sharpened their knives with the intention of taking his life—I do not recollect that he mentioned any particular names—he accused Dunn, the cook, of a design on his life, but I do not recollect whether he said he had sharpened his knife—I should say this added to the captain's excitement—I did not hear French tell the captain the crew intended to seize him and take the ship to the continent—I heard it afterwards, but do not think it was French told him—I heard Cone tell the captain so—that was alter Rambert jumped overboard—I can<lb/>not say whether it was before or after Rason's death—I also heard Dunn tell the captain that French had sharpened his knife on both edges, and volunteered to be among the first to take the captain's life—this was half an hour or an hour after the statement given by French—I do not recollect hearing any</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020031"/>
               <p>other statement made to the captain-about the intention of the crew—as far as I recollect, I heard the captain ask Cordeviola when he called him down if he knew anything about Rason, and he said Morris knew something about it—that was shortly before Rason was called down—I recollect Cordeviola accusing an able seaman, named Gair, in the captain's presence, of having come to him and held a marlinspike to his breast, and say he would run that into him if he would not assist in taking the captain's life, which Gair admitted—he said he would run it into him or through him, or words to that effect—I frequently heard Yelverton mention to the captain about sharpening the knives, but the crew generally were making statements to the captain of the intention of others towards him, but I wish to state how that was—the captain sent for some one of the crew down into the cabin, held a sword over him, and threatened to cut or wound him if he did not state that he had heard some other person say something against him; and the person, to shield him<lb/>self, would do so, the captain having threatened to cut him if he did not state so and so about some of the crew having an intention towards him—the first com<lb/>munication I heard was made by Yelverton—his were all voluntary—French's communication against Dunn was voluntary, and Dunn's against French—it was after those three voluntary statements that the captain threatened to cut different people if they did not make communications against each other—I went with the captain into Fayal—I was on shore, and cannot say whether the crew made any complaint to the harbour-master when on board—I was only there just as he was leaving—the captain drank in my presence at Fayal, but not to excess—he was not drunk when he came on board—we only staid at Fayal one day—we did not come to anchor—before that the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Eglinton</hi>, an English vessel, had been on board for about an hour and a half—it was be<lb/>tween Rambert's death and our arrival off Fayal—he was about the vessel with the crew—this happened to Rason about three days after we left Fayal—between his death and our leaving Fayal Yelverton had not again made a communication to the captain about the crew, not to my recollection—French had made a voluntary statement—when Glover was sent for Rason, the captain was more than half drunk—I think he had been in a state of excitement the whole time—French had made a communication to him the day before—the day after we left Fayal—he was constantly excited, frightened of his life apparently—when Rason came down the captain shook him on the sofa—he struck him with the point of the bayonet—he stuck him about his thigh—at that time Yelverton was in the cabin, and I think Cordeviola—I did not remain in the cabin but a short time after the blow was given, it might be five or ten minutes, it was certainly five and might be ten—Rason still sat on the sofa after the blow was given—he did not say anything that I recollect—I was sitting in the cabin—Yelverton and Dunn were sitting down—they did not move that I saw—when I returned I saw Rason stretched below the sofa—I did not hear the captain call to him and ask him to speak to him—I looked at the captain—he appeared more calm—he said nothing to me about Rason being murdered—the captain was sitting on the sofa—Dunn was standing there—I did not hear any lint called for—I left again shortly after—I was not present when he afterwards stabbed the body with a sword—the body was sewn up in canvass when I performed the burial service—I do not know who did it—in any extraordinary case the mate usually signs the log with the captain—when I made the entry the chief mate was dead—I cannot say whether I made the entry before or after Mars' death—I signed it about the same time as the captain did—the captain always signed after every one else—every body signed this before him—they signed it a day or two after I made the entry—long before we got into the Downs—I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020032"/>
               <p>read it over to each of them—there might be two or three at a time—the captain, to the best of my recollection, was not present when they signed it—they signed it from time to time—two might sign at once—the captain called them in before the entry was made, and I told them they were to sign two entries I was going to make—I do not think he was present when they signed—the captain called me into the cabin, told me what I was to say, and directed me to write it in pencil on paper and bring it to him and he would correct it—I did so in this case—I wrote it in pencil, showed it to him, and then copied it in the log—I cannot say whether he corrected it in this par<lb/>ticular case, but he generally made some slight alteration—he would add some new matter and take out some—I cannot say what he did on this occasion—I heard the captain say Rason died in a fit—he said, "Did he not, cook?" and Dunn said, "Yes, he did"—that was at the time I returned to the cabin—I remember Nelson, one of the crew, being ill—the captain gave up the greater part of his water to him—the captain was on exactly the same allowance as the crew—he gave this to Nelson on two occasions—that was just before Yelverton made the communication to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You observed excitement about the captain from the time Yelverton made the first communication to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, that was the day after we had fallen in with a French barque, and got wine and brandy and stores from her—the captain began to drink from that time—French was put in irons for a short time, but not Dunn, that I recollect—Yelverton's communication was made some days before we got to Fayal, and before Rambert's death—we fell in with the French barque on the 23rd Sept., at eight in the afternoon, and at six Ram<lb/>bert jumped overboard, on the 25th by the log—from that time we continued peaceably and orderly on board, till we got to Fayal on the 23rd Oct.—French made the communication to the captain on the 24th—it did not refer at all to Rason—the captain did not ask Rason on his entering the cabin what he was labouring under, that I heard—I was there—I wrote that in the log, as the captain desired me—may I state my reason for entering this in the log by the captain's direction, though I knew it to be false?—I saw how he was con<lb/>ducting himself, and if he got a refusal to do what he bid, I knew he was determined to put an end to any one's existence, in fact he told me so—I have heard him say so two or three times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he say that in reference to the entries in the log? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, he told me if he met with any refusal from me, I would not have long to live—that was after Rambert's case—I wrote the entry about that case, under the captain's direction, and was quite unconcerned what I wrote, resolving to tell the truth when I came before the proper authorities of the country—no grog was allowed by the ship's articles—the captain frequently gave the men grog all through the voyage—they generally had a glass of grog when they reefed the top sail—the <hi rend="italic">Eglinton</hi> was a merchant vessel.</p>

                  </hi>. I was an apprentice on board the <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi>—I shipped at Liverpool—on passing the Cape on the homeward voyage the provisions and water fell short—on the night we expected to make Ascension Island I was forward with Rason and some of the crew—we were on short allowance at the time (I think it was before we fell in with the French barque)—I asked Rason if he thought we should make the land before morning—he said he did not know, but if we did make the land, he would put a blue shirt on the fore yard-arm, so that some of the men-of-war's men might come on board, and he would let them know how they had been treated during the passage, and the captain would be no more captain of the <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi>—that was all I heard to the best of my recollection—some time after the captain sent on deck for me into the cabin—it was after we fell in with the French barque—I think it was the day after—he began to speak to me about how the mate had insulted him, and said he could judge by the mate's appearance that there had been something going on that was not right, and asked if I had heard anything about it—I said I did not hear anything at all—he took the cutlass in his hand, and said, "Tell me this instant, did not you hear any person</p>

               <p>threatening my life"—I told him I did not, and he sent on deck for French, and said, "French, were you not forward and heard Thomas Rason say, if we did not make the island of Ascension before morning, he would have my life?"—French said he did hear him say so, and that Yelverton heard the same—I told him what I had heard Rason say—French told him they had sharpened their knives on the grindstone to take his life—the captain began cursing me that I was a pretty apprentice in not coming to tell him before—he went on deck, and sent for me to come on deck about half an hour after—I went and found him there, and the two mates and carpenter—they were armed—I had no arms—the crew were all aft at the time—he asked the crew if he had not always acted upright to them, or something, and they said he did—Rason, Lee, and Cone were aft at the time, and in irons, and the captain was cursing at them, and cutting at them—they were still in irons—Rason was in one part of the vessel, and the others at the break of the poop—I saw the captain cut at each of them with the cutlass—he cut them on the head and face—I saw them all three bleeding—they remained in irons till the next afternoon—till Rambert jumped overboard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the night before Rambert jumped overboard the men being removed from where they were, and put in irons in the topsails? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> To the best of my knowledge that was the same night that they were first in irons—the anchor shackles were put on the neck of each of them—the legs of each were ironed with bilboes, and they were hawled up into the tops by ropes—our anchor shackle weighs fifty or sixty pounds—they remained in the tops till after Rambert's death, and were then released, and returned to their duty in the ship—things went on quietly after that, till we arrived off Fayal—I went on shore with the captain there—Rason, Lee, and Cone, were part of the boat's crew, who went on shore—I remained with the boat—I do not know the British consul—I saw a gentleman come to the boat with the captain—I thought the captain was rather intoxicated when he returned to the ship—Mars was at that time acting as first-mate—we re<lb/>mained off Fayal till next day—we did not anchor, but it was very calm—about two days after we left Fayal, Rason was sent for into the cabin—the captain had been drinking a good deal, and was rather intoxicated—before Rason was sent for the captain said, "There is one son of a b—h who has not been examined yet," and desired Morris (who had been ill the greater part of the passage) to be sent for—when Morris came, the captain asked him if he had heard anything, any plot laid against his life, or something to that effect—Morris said he did not—he said he had heard Rason and Cone say, when they arrived in London, they would have law from the captain for what he had done—Rason was then called into the cabin—he was sent on deck, and called down again—I was in the cabin each time that he came down—the first time that he came the captain said that he would have his law to-night; "It is my day to-night, and yours to-morrow; I will give you law, you son of a b—h," and he cut him two or three times with a cutlass about the head—after that he was sent on deck—this was the beginning of the night, about seven or eight o'clock; and between twelve and one he was sent for again—I was in the cabin when he came down, and the captain began pitching him about, and striking him with the cutlass—he sat on the sofa sometimes—the captain had been speaking to him about what Morris had said, but I cannot recollect whether that was the second time that he came down—he hit him about two or three times with the cutlass, then put the cutlass down, and took the bayonet in his hand—when he first came down the second time he began cursing and swearing at him and cutting him with the cutlass—Rason asked him to spare him, both before and after he had cut him with</p>

               <p>the cutlass—he asked him several times—the captain held the bayonet out in his hand, and used the expression, "Here is the arm that slew the Boyne, &amp;c."—he was pitching him about with his left hand at the time—Rason did not resist or do anything—after he put the cutlass away he took the bayonet—I saw him stab him twice, as he sat on the sofa, on the left breast—he died in about ten minutes—when he was dying the captain said to him, "Speak to me, I will forgive you," or something—the body remained on the floor of the cabin, at the foot of the cabin stairs—I there saw the captain put the cutlass on the haunch of the dead body, and <hi rend="italic">shove</hi> it in about the shoulder, telling the people that he would serve the whole of them the same way—he said, "See what this fellow has brought on himself—some of the crew had been called down at the time to take the body on deck—the same night he was in the cabin and saying to Thompson and the crew how he would make the sons of b—t—s walk the plank.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after Rason's death was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think the next night—he did not say anything more the same night that I recollect—he was rather intoxicated the next night—he drank a great deal more after falling in with the French barque than before—he was generally rather drunk when he used the expression about the battle of Boyne—before Rambert's death the captain slept alone in the cabin; afterwards somebody slept in the cabin with him—I signed the log-book at different times—this is my signature to the log—I think I signed it the day after Rason's death—I knew he did not die in a fit—what I said was read over to me several times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to sign that Rason died in a fit? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The captain said, if we would not sign, he would cut our hearts out, and make us sign with our hearts' blood—I knew Rason did not die in a fit.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Crass-examined. Q.</hi> I believe you belong to the Isle of Man? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I left there two years ago—I was not charged there with shooting a man—I left because I wished; that Was my only reason—I was never charged with shooting a man, and never did shoot at any man—it was after we fell in with the French barque I told the captain what the crew had said—nobody was present—Spence was not present that I am aware of—I might have made a communication in his presence.</p>

               <p>when the captain came on deck, there was nobody there—it was before Rambert's death that Rason, Lee, and Cone were in irons, for Rambert was there armed—I think he jumped overboard the next day, but am not certain—at the time the captain cut at them with the culass they were all three to<lb/>gether on the poop—Cone was near the half-hatch—they were all aft at the break of the poop, sitting on the deck, with their feet and hands ironed—he cut them about the head and face—I could see the blood running over their face—he cut them a good many times—I heard him strike Cone fifty times when he was on the mizen-top—he cut them a great many times when on deck, sometimes with the sharp edge of the sword, with the flat, and back—they bled—some of the crew were aft—the men were <hi rend="italic">singing</hi> out when they were cut—they were afterwards hawled up to the top, and when there he cut Cone I should say fifty times—he was about a quarter of an hour slashing at him, cutting him the whole time—he was still in irons—I think he had no anchor shackle on his neck, but the other two had—his hands and feet were ironed at the time to the best of my knowledge—they were taken down after Rambert jumped overboard—I think that was the next day—they were in the tops at the time he jumped overboard—when they were taken down they were taken into the cabin, and I believe the captain gave them each a glass of wine, but I was not there myself—they were sitting there with the captain about an hour.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Between the time of leaving Fayal and the death of Rason, had you stated anything to the captain about what the crew had done? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—he had called the crew down several times, and I heard the greater part of the crew telling things of each other when he called them down—the first time Rason was called down that night I think Spence and French were present—I cannot recollect who else—he was cut a good deal on the first occasion on the head and face—when he came down the second time the blood was dried up—there were the marks of blood on his temples and head, more than one cut—Cordeviola and Spence were present on the second occasion, but Spence went out of the cabin when he was called—I cannot recollect Slack being there—I am not sure he was not there—I saw a boy called <hi rend="italic">Jemmy</hi> in and out—I cannot say whether he was there at the time of the blows—Dunn was there to the best of my knowledge when he came into the cabin—there was nobody there when he was stabbed but Cordeviola—when he came down the first time the captain had the cutlass in his hand—he might have said, "This is the arm that won the Boyne," &amp;c., while he held the cutlass—he did when he had the bayonet, and was saying it all night nearly—he struck him two or three times or so with the cutlass the second time he came down, on the head and body, <hi rend="italic">shoving</hi> it against him—he did not stab him with the cutlass—he struck him with the blade of it once or twice—I am certain he struck him on the head with the cutlass more than once, and two or three times with the flat of it—I saw the blood running from him—I did not pay atten<lb/>tion whether he cut him more than once—he afterwards put it down, took up the bayonet and rushed at him with it—he took the bayonet off the table by his side—I do not recollect his calling anybody first—I did not see anybody come before he stabbed him—I saw him take up the bayonet—the cabin was light—he put down the cutlass and had the bayonet in his hand afterwards—I believe he took it up—I did not see it given to him—I do not suppose any<lb/>body could have come into the cabin and give it to him without my seeing it—to the best of my knowledge he took it up himself—I saw the bayonet on the table—I did not hear him call to anybody for it—he might have done it—he put the cutlass down and had the bayonet in his hand at the instant—he then pitched him backward and forward with his left hand for a few minutes—he raised him from the sofa and pitched him backward and forward—Cordeviola</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then he had not the cutlass and bayonet both in his hand together? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, he put the cutlass to the Haunch, and stamped his foot down and said, "You see what this fellow has brought on himself, and I will serve you out the same way"—he then <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> the cutlass into his body—not more than once that I am aware of—that was about an hour or two after he was stabbed.</p>

               <p>told them to turn to, and they said they could not turn to on a quart of water a day—this was the day we were in the parallel of Ascension, the day we expected to make it—Rambert went down to the cabin, and the captain came on deck with him—the captain had nothing in his hand when he came on deck—he came up directly, went forward, and said if any man came aft the wind<lb/>lass he would shoot him—he and Rambert afterwards went on the poop—I was at the wheel at the time, and heard the captain say to Rambert that he would have them on a pint of water, and after that he would see them glad to take a wine glass, and after that he would see them hanging at the main-stay like porpoises, sucking each other's blood—when I was relieved from the wheel and went forward, I told the crew what I had heard the captain say—this was about four or five days before we fell in with the French barque—I remember the day before we fell in with the barque—there was a vessel in sight in the course of that day before dinner, but the <hi rend="italic">Tory</hi> had kept her course, and had not made for that vessel—about dinner time that day, French came into the forecastle with his knife sharpened at both edges—Rason was in the forecastle at that time, and most of the crew—French said if the captain touched him, he would have his guts out—I had said we had better go aft to the captain and ask him for some more stores, and if he was to offer to take any person's life, to confine him till we got to a British port—when French made use of the expression I have named, Rason said it could be done without murder—that was all that passed—next day we fell in with the French barque, and got provisions, water, wine, and brandy—I mentioned to the captain that evening, the 23rd of Sept., what I had heard said by some of the crew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to tell the captain on that night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because I had heard that French had told the captain that I was going to secure him in the lower forecastle and murder him—on that evening the captain, the two mates, the carpenter, and the two apprentices, came on deck together—they were not armed when we came on the poop—the captain said that Rason had forsworn his life away—Rason said he had not—the captain did not say anything to any of the other men—he then ordered us off the poop, Rason, Cone, Lee, and myself—we went—on that the captain took up his cutlass and cut Rason on the shoulder, as he was going off the poop—the three men were put in irons about half an hour afterwards—Rason was bleeding at the time—they remained in irons three days—they were first placed on the main hatch for two days, and the night before Rambert's death, Rason and Lee were put on the main-top, with shackles round their necks, and Cone was placed in the mizen-top—that was about seven o'clock in the evening—they remained there until after Rambert had gone overboard, which was about four o'clock next morning—they were then brought down and released—between that time and Rason's death, everything was quite quiet on board the ship—I remember, on the night of Rason's death, his being sent for to the cabin—I cannot say whether he was sent for more than once—that was about a quarter past twelve o'clock at night—I was in the pantry when he came into the cabin—I could see into the cabin from the pantry—the cabin door was left open, and I could hear what was said—there is a door to the cabin, and a passage between the cabin and pantry about three feet wide—there is a door to the pantry to shut it off from the cabin—both the doors were open—the first thing I saw when Rason came down was, the captain took him and <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> him about the cabin—I did not observe whether the captain had anything in his hand at that time—he said to Rason that he would have his life—Rason begged for mercy—the captain said he would have none on him—I did not see the captain do any<lb/>thing, but I heard a noise as if the captain was striking the bayonet into his</p>

               <p>head—I took it to be that—the boy Glover came and told me the captain had killed Rason—I went on deck and got some water, and then I went into the cabin—when I got into the cabin Rason was lying on the captain's couch—he was just breathing a little—the captain said, "Speak two words to me, Rason"—I saw at that time that he had received two wounds in his left breast—I did not observe any other—the captain had nothing in his hand when I went into the cabin—I did not take notice of anything in his hand before the death of Rason—there was a bayonet on the floor when I went in on Glover calling me—I told the captain he had better get some lint and put on the wound—the captain sent Glover for some—he brought some cotton, which the captain put on the wound—Rason then died—his body was taken out by the pantry door, just outside the cabin door—it remained there till about a quarter past four o'clock—I saw the captain place his cutlass on the stomach of the dead body, and he said to Mars, who was in the cabin, "See what you have brought this man to"—the body was afterwards taken to the top-gallant forecastle—I told David Johnson to wash it and put clean clothes on it—the captain ordered five men to take it to the top-gallant forecastle—I cannot say who the men were that carried it—I did not assist—I afterwards signed the log—I was aware that the log stated that Rason died in a fit—I had said nothing before that as to Rason having died in a fit—the captain said he would put down in the log-book that Rason had died of convulsions—I was in the cabin when French said some of the men would not sign it with pen and ink, and he said if they would not sign it with pen and ink, he would cut out their hearts, and make them sign it with their own heart's blood.</p>

               <p>he said to Mars, "See what you have brought the man to"—that was all he said—the occurrence between the captain and the mate, on the poop, was about four or five days before we spoke the French barque, the day we were off Ascension—I knew that the water and bread was very abort—we had as much as could properly be allowed us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you then to say you would go to the captain and ask for more stores? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because there were other things that might have been given, such as ginger and wine—I do not mean part of the cargo, but things in the cabin—ship's stores—I did not say if he did not give them, I would confine him—I said we would go and ask for stores, and if he offered to take anybody's life, we would confine him—it was not exactly on that that one of them said he would rip his guts out—it was only French I heard say that—Rason said they could do it without murder, and I said I would confine him—all the crew said it would be the best way to confine him, if he did offer to take any person's life—I do not know of the captain's having given up some of his own water to Nelson, who was sick—I heard of it afterwards, in the Channel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe you had had some quarrel with the captain about a woman on board? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—it was a Mrs. Blewitt—a charge was made against me for living with that woman—it was not so—I did not live with her on board the ship—I do not live with her now—I did when I arrived in England—I went and lived in lodgings with her—I was not taken up for robbing her—I was never taken up on any charge before a Magistrate—I went down to the Thames police of my own accord, with her and a policeman—she made a charge against me at the station—I did not go before a Magistrate—I and Mrs. Blewitt, and a policeman, went together, before one of the officers at the Thames Police-office—I was taken there for taking 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of my own out of Mrs. Blewitt's box—she charged me with stealing it—the officer asked whether the money belonged to me—she said, "Yes," and I was dismissed.</p>

Johnson had no authority to sell him goods on credit—I should not have allowed anything of the kind—from something that occurred on a day pre<lb/>vious to the 28th of Jan. I desired Felling and Evans to watch his proceedings when he came again—on the 28th of Jan. I received a communication from Pelling, in consequence of which I followed Broom from the shop, and gave him into custody—when at the station he took from his pocket a brown paper parcel containing about 2,000 needles—I also saw one pair of braces and three pairs of stockings taken out of his pack—I believe them to be our property.</p>

I am an inmate of Morden College, Black heath—in the course of the last year I resided for some time at Clapton—during that time I was waited on by the prisoner's wife as my nurse—I employed the prisoner occasionally—I was in the habit of receiving from my cousin at Southampton, checks for small sums, very seldom beyond five pounds—this check is not my cousin's writing—I know nothing of this check—I never gave it to the prisoner to get it changed, or had anything to say to him on the subject—I never saw the check in my life till I was before the Magistrate—I returned to the college, I think, on the 18th of Aug.—I saw no more of the prisoner after that till the evening of the 13th Dec., when he came to the college about six o'clock—I was up at the time, and my nurse was with me—I inquired how his wife did—he put a half-crown on the table for my nurse—I told her not to take it, because it would be more useful to his family and children—she did not take it, but left it on the table—he then put a sovereign into my hand, and then immediately put in two more—I said, "I will not accept of this unless you inform me how you came by it, or who it is that sent you"—he said nothing, but closed my hand, fixed the money in it, and said, "It is yours," and he kissed my hand, said there was a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> waiting, and off he went—he appeared to me to have been drinking—he took a little gin and water at my place—just before I left Clapton I had occasion<lb/>ally employed him to write a few letters to persons with whom I had for<lb/>merly been acquainted—he wrote the letters, and I signed them myself—they were written to particular friends of my own—Mrs. Tate had spoken to me about those letters before I went back to the college, and in consequence of what she told me I desired him not to deliver any letters belonging to me, or written by me, to any of my friends, because I was informed that he was</p>

I shall not accept of anything of the kind unless you tell me for what reason you give it me, or from whence it comes"—he made no answer—he sat some time—Mr. Timson had a glass of gin-and-water, and the prisoner partook of it—they talked of one thing and another for about half an hour or better, till Mr. Timson seemed quite fatigued—he asked Mr. Timson to spend Christmas with him, he could provide him a nice bed and plenty of everything—Mr. Timson said his health was not fit for that, he could never come—the prisoner had some gin-and-water and a glass of wine also, which I gave him—I left the room for a short time, to prepare Mr. Timson's bed—I came back in about five minutes, and Mr. Timson then had three sovereigns in his hand—he opened his hand and said, "I have got three sovereigns"—I said, "Indeed, have you?"—the prisoner jumped up out of the chair and said, "Good night, God bless you! take it, it is yours"—he said, "I will not keep it unless you tell me where you got it, or from whence it came"—he jumped up, opened the door, and went away saying, "I have got a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and a man waiting"—that was all I heard.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I first became acquainted with Mr. William Timson on the 24th of Dec, 1844, and was employed by him as a messenger; he was at that time on a visit to Mrs. Tate, his daughter; it was limited to a week, but Mr. Timson, for purposes which will appear presently, was seized with an attack of epilepsy, and was unable to return home; it was then he employed Mr. Garratt, of Hackney, who will certify that his illness was mostly caused by excessive drink, as he has many times told me, and Mr. Allen will state the quantity of drink consumed by him; when Mr. Timson found his money nearly exhausted he employed me to write from two to three hundred letters ten, twenty, forty, and forty-five a day, to many gentlemen, and many to Mr. Henry Thomas Timson, who, he informed me, from time to time, transmitted him checks varying from 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he employed me to cash them; I have done so many times, but, having a severe injury on the head, I am unable to recollect the dates—he received, on the strength of the letters I wrote from his dictation, nearly 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and a copy of one letter, in his own handwriting, was in possession of the police, together with other letters, and a copy of cer<lb/>tain bankruptcy proceedings to the amount of upwards of 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he</p>

               <p>many times told me Mr. Henry Thomas Timson would be glad to get hold of; after thirteen weeks' residence at Clapton he returned to Blackheath, leaving every tradesman in debt; he afterwards returned, and lodged first at Mr. Alby's, the ironmonger's, who will speak as to the state of Mr. Timson while there; he had not been there a week before I cashed him a check for 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Mr. Hubble's; he afterwards moved to Mr. Dawes', the post-master's, whose brother William I will call, and who received instructions from Mr. Timson to deliver to him any letters addressed to Charles Marlow, Esq., it being agreed to distinguish such letters from my own from private friends; in the course of a few days he got me to write sixty letters without any signature, as he said he would sign them himself, and which I posted, directed to dif<lb/>ferent gentlemen; he wished me to write again; I refused when I found he dictated such infamous falsehoods for the purpose of exciting commiseration; he subsequently sent about for another person to write for him; he wished me to wait on the gentlemen personally; I did so, and among them I may mention Mr. Alderman Moon, with whose son I had an interview; I have a list of thirty-four persons whom I waited on, but every one of them, except two or three, expressed the greatest disgust at his conduct, and said he was an accomplished old swindler; I told him the result of my applications, and he wrote another letter to Mr. Timson for money, which I do not think was attended to, as, after a sufficient time for an answer, he said his cousin ought to do something for him, as the money in his cousin's hands ought to be his, for his father had robbed him of 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and he said, if he did not send him something, he would get out of him what he could; he afterwards left Upper Clapton, indebted to almost every one; the two medical gentlemen, and even my wife and myself, were not paid. On the 10th of Nov. I received a communication from him, enclosing a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. check, desiring me to pay his bill which was due to Mr. Hubble; I did so, and if Mr. Hubble or the soli<lb/>citor for the prosecution would take the trouble to examine and compare time, place, and circumstances, I should be exonerated altogether; I beg the check produced may be compared with the begging letters in the hands of the police; I assert that every time I cashed checks it has been by the order of Mr. Timson or Mrs. Tate; although Mrs. Tate says she never gave me a check to pay bills—I have highly respectable persons to prove she re<lb/>ceived a check of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Mr. Henry Thomas Timson, and I can produce the grocer's errand-boy, Charles Spinks, to prove that since Christmas last he has delivered to me two letters from Mrs. Tate at my own house, and Mrs. Clark will state that I went out for the purpose of waiting on Mrs. Tate by her orders; I had the check from her to pay for the brandy; I have a wife and four children, and I too sincerely doat on them to run the risk of punish<lb/>ment and separation from them for the paltry consideration of a few pounds; I have been an unconscious tool in the hands of artful and designing persons, and I solemnly declare my innocence; Mr. William Timson says he left Upper Clapton because of my bad character, that he was frightened of being appre<lb/>hended in consequence of my delivering these letters, and yet he afterwards gives me a recommendation; then again he says I left directly after giving him the money, the evening I called on him at Blackheath, and the servant says I stopped for half an hour, and she did not see what kind of recom<lb/>mendation it was; it was no recommendation to the Brighton Railway Company.</p>

The prisoner works at Mr. Frost's rope-ground, which is nearly opposite my house—I have been in the habit of seeing him often—he comes there usually of a morning for coffee—on the 20th of Jan. I had been up stairs, and brought down a gown and a purse with it—I placed the dress on the back of a chair to air at the fire, and the purse I put on the sofa—it contained five sove<lb/>reigns and one half-sovereign, two half-crowns, and a shilling, a gold ring, a gold chain, and six duplicates—before I had time to change my dress the prisoner came in with other boys, Page, Pitt, and Cotton, for some coffee—hearing them come in, I picked up my dress and ran up stairs to dress myself, leaving my purse on the sofa—I forgot it—I came down in a few minutes, before the lads had left and cut some bread and butter for Page—the prisoner was sitting close to where I had laid my purse—Page sat close by him and Cotton on the opposite side, away from them—Pitt came in afterwards—he was not with them at first—they all went away in six or seven minutes after I came down, and a few minutes after they were gone I missed my purse—it did not exceed a quarter of an hour altogether—a policeman was called in—this is my purse (<hi rend="italic">looking at it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi>, Esq. I am water bailiff of the City of London, and sub-conservator of the river Thames—I have been so upwards of twenty-one years—I know a landing-place and stairs called Paul's Wharf-stairs—it is an ancient and public landing-stairs, and plying-place for boats, wherries, and all sorts of vessels—on the 20th of Jan. I received some information respecting the state of those stairs, and some vessels in front of them—I went in consequence and examined the state of the stairs on the 21st—I felt it my duty to communicate what I had observed there to the Lord Mayor, and in consequence the Lord Mayor and I went on the same day in the morning, to visit the spot together—when we arrived there there were three barges, two of them were placed in and out, from the shore, and the third up and down the stream, so as to make a floating pier, which in my judgment created an obstruction to boats coming and going from the stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> While that was there could any wherry or skiff, or barge, approach and make fast off the stairs as conveniently as they could before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend upon which way they were coming—if they were coming from the lower side of the pier, that is the London bridge side, they would have to row round it, if they were coming from the upper side they would get in with tole<lb/>rable facility—with facility indeed I should say—the Lord Mayor examined the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020066"/>
               <p>state of things there with me, and in consequence directed me to remove it—during the twenty-one years I have been water-bailiff I have never known such a floating pier off those stairs before—having received instructions from the Lord Mayor to remove it, I next morning proceeded to the spot in a steam-tug, with about forty hands altogether, five or six of them were policemen I think—on arriving off the stairs I gave my men orders to remove the two barges—I know the steamboat, <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5, she was there that morning—she was more outside of one of the barges, the inner one of the two that I have mentioned as lying in and out from the wharf—this inner one was then nearly filled with water, and the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steam-boat was lying outside of her—by the inner one I mean the one nearest to the wharf—I described two as lying in and out from the wharf, and the one nearest the wharf I call the inner—the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> was lying outside of that, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>,) that is not the position in which she was at the time—she was lying outside the barge nearest the stairs—she was further out in the river—there was no barge that I saw toward the mid stream—she was lying head and stern up and down the river—about full-length, her head up towards Black<lb/>friars—I should say it was about ten minutes past seven in the morning when I arrived off the stairs—my men removed one of the barges with<lb/>out opposition, without difficulty—when she had been removed she was brought off to be made fast to the tug, in order to take her away—the one on the westward side, the one nearest to Blackfriars-bridge was the one that was first removed—I ought to mention that the barges were not in the same position in which I have described them—previous to my coming there on the following morning they had been shifted from that position—the floating pier there was not the same as it had been the day before—this is a fair description, (<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>,) no doubt of it—this is the floating pier—that is one of the barges that is in the position in which it was in the morning, lying sunk, and that was in a different position—that accurately represents the position of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> 5 on that morning, with the exception that her head was up—that is the position in which she is de<lb/>scribed—the three barges on the day before were moored as if to make the letter T, one on each side and the other at the top; and when I came again, the second of the two barges, which I have described as lying in and out on the 2lst, I found removed to the upper side of the piles, as seen on the plan; and the third, forming, as it were, the crossbar of the T, was removed to the lower side—they had been taken entirely away for the purposes of a pier—they were removed, as I believe, to prevent my taking them—they were removed so as to be no obstruction in the morning—these are the two outer ones—the one lying up and down the river, and the outer<lb/>most of those which were lying in and out, had been removed away—nothing remained but the barge which was moored in and out nearest to the shore, and that was sunk—it was full of water, or nearly so, when I arrived there—all three of the barges were made fast by chains in the morning, in the positions to which they had been removed—they were made fast in those separate places—they were certainly not placed there for any purpose of business, and had no business to be lying there, made fast—I do not say that it was an improper position at all—there was one sunk and full of water—it might have been an accident—it was not proper, of course, to be full of water—I do not know how the sunken barge had been sunk, and got full of water—at the time we were tak<lb/>ing away the third barge there were several persons on board—the second barge I took away, which I described as having been taken away without difficulty, was lying on the upper side of the piles—the remaining one was lying on the other side—their original position was, one moored in and out nearest the shore,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020067"/>
               <p>one in and out a straight line continuing that, and one across; and in the morning I found the two outer ones removed away, and moored not in any im<lb/>proper situation—it was the second one I moved away—I removed the second and third—the one lying on the upper side of the piles was removed without much difficulty—the third was lying on the lower side of the piles, and there there was a scuffle—I moved the one on the upper side first—I did not see anybody in her at that time—when she had been moved she was made fast to my steam-tug by chain and rope—I afterwards directed my people to remove the third barge, that is the one that formed the T end, the one lying to the east down the river—there were persons on board that barge—I do not know how many—it was not fairly daylight—I could see there were persons, but I could not undertake to say how many—there were persons on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5—the defendant Kinchin was on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5, at that time, I could not make him out, but he was on board—I do not know that I knew him by name before—I knew his person—I have seen him often—I knew him as acting as captain of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5—I saw him on board her that morning—upon my people pro<lb/>ceeding to remove the third barge a scuffle took place between my people and the people on board the barge—I cannot describe what sort of a scuffle it was—I was not near enough to see—I was on board the tug—I could see there was a scuffle and that is all—my people succeeded in taking possession of this second barge, they brought it off to my tug—she was also made fast with ropes and chains to the steam tug—when these two barges had been made fast to my steam-tug, some of my people were on board both of them—having taken the two barges in tow, I proceeded to tow them away to some place of safety—I do not know what power my tug was—I should think I had got 300 yards with these two barges in tow, going eastward—it was my intention to take them to the Commercial Dock, which is below Lon<lb/>don Bridge—when the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, boat <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 5, came at us full speed, I should say, and cut the barges adrift from the tug boat—she ran in between me and the barges I had in tow, and cut them adrift—it was done with very great violence, so much so that I think the lives of all the parties on board the barges were in very great danger—the effect of the shock was that it tore part of the barge out, and they were separated—our steam-boat was somewhat damaged also—I had the two barges again made fast to my steam-tug—I cannot say exactly what position the <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5 took while this was being done—but as soon as ever we had made fast she was ready to come at us again—as soon as we had made fast the two barges again, she made a second attempt to cut them adrift—she did not succeed that time, we had made the two barges fast with a stronger chain—she got entangled with us and the barges—she got in between the stern of the tug and the barges—I am not able to say whether she set on her power—she certainly kept on her steam—she did not back to get clear of us—the effect of her hanging on us entangled in this way was to pre<lb/>vent us from taking our course down the river, and instead of that kept turn<lb/>ing us round and round in the river—I cannot say I entertained much appre<lb/>hension for the parties on board, at that time, but for those navigating the river—it was dangerous for those coming up and down at this time—we were sweeping from one side to the other—I did not feel any apprehension for myself, but for the parties navigating the river—me and my people did all we could to get clear of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5—we were not able to do so till we took posses<lb/>sion of the wheel—in consequence of not being able to clear I gave my people orders to board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> and take possession of her wheel—my people boarded the steam-boat—Kinchin was on board at that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020068"/>
               <p>time—when?my people endeavoured to take possession of the steamer, his men resisted it—it had got light at this time—there was resistance offered—I saw it—the resistance was shoving them back, and when my watermen attempted to get possession of the wheel, they held on to prevent them from taking it—Kinchin did not personally resist—he was on the paddle-box—I did not observe whether or not he was giving orders and directions to his men to make that resistance—I do not know that any of his men had weapons in their hands—my people succeeded in getting possession of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>—we eventually got clear by having taken possession of the wheel—I know the defendant Dadd—I saw him while the struggle was taking place—he had an anchor, stock in his hand—having got clear, I pro<lb/>ceeded in my steam-tug, with the two barges in tow, towards London-bridge, leaving the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steam-boat behind—when we had got near London<lb/>bridge, I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> coming after us again—a part of my men were left on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, in possession of her wheel—none of my men were on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5, when she got near London-bridge, I had put some on board—they had got rid of them—I did not see how—I saw there were none of them on board—I do not know what had become of them—when she came towards us the third time, near London-bridge, she came at considerable speed, (I should not say at full speed,) that was very near to London-bridge—when she approached us, she ran in between the barges, and the steam-boat, as she had done twice before—we got through the bridge with our barges in tow—we were forced over towards the Custom-house, by her being foul of us—she kept foul of us, the effect of which was to force us off our course—the river is pretty crowded off the Custom-house stairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it convenient for the public purposes that you should be driven off there? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Very dangerous—after we had been driven in this way off Custom-house stairs, the defendant Dadd came on board our tug, and asked me to let him have one of the barges—he did not say what for—I told him I would not give up either without the Lord Mayor's orders—the Commercial Dock is lower down the river—I did not take the barges there, because I considered I should be endangering the lives of the persons I employed, and the public navigation of the river, if I had proceeded any further—I therefore moored the barges off the Custom-house Quay, and agreed to go with Mr. Dadd to the Lord Mayor—I went on shore, leaving some of our people in charge of the tug and barges—I saw Paul's-wharf Stairs next day, Friday, the 23rd—they had then got a barge on the outside of the one which I represented as sunk outside the other two, and steamer <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5—the second barge was not there then—there was the outside barge, another barge, and the steamer <hi rend="italic">Waterman No.</hi> 5—they were made fast—they were on the ground, in fact, when the Lord Mayor saw them—they were not so placed on Friday as to constitute a floating pier—they did not project so far into the river—they projected into the river at tide time—there was a cross boat up and down the stream, and the sunk boat, but it was not then sunk—I merely speak of her as being the same—they would all be aground at that part of the river at low water, but would float with the tide in the posi<lb/>tion they were in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And though on the Friday they did not extend as far out in the river as on the Wednesday, did they form an obstruction to the landing and getting to and from those stairs on the Friday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not when I saw them, because they were aground—if the tide had lifted them, and they were afloat, they then would have been an obstruction.</p>

               <p>to stop the steamer, No. 5, I gave directions to my men to drop the anchor if they could—that was after we had got the barge away—taking the stock out of an anchor would prevent it holding, but the anchor I desired them to drop was perfect—when I found we could not get clear, I ordered my men to board, and at the same time gave directions to drop the anchor—I did not hear what they said when my people were put on board—from twelve to fifteen men, I should say, went to take possession of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer, No. 5—they forced their way up to the wheel, pushed the man away who was at the wheel, and took the wheel at first—there was no talking between the parties in going down the river—it was all done in silence—there was no con<lb/>versation addressed to me, as far as I know—I cannot say what passed between others—I neither heard them say, "Give us our dummies," either to myself or anybody else—I had orders to take possession of these barges—these dum<lb/>mies belonged to the Waterman's Company—they had been used the night be<lb/>fore at the pier—Mr. Dadd came on board us at the Custom-house—I did not request him to do so—I did not ask anybody to come—I agreed to leave the dummies at the Custom-house stairs, or near the Custom-house wharf, until an application had been made to the Lord Mayor—I thought it was the best thing to do under the circumstances—I and Mr. Dadd went to the Mansion-house—we did not see the Lord Mayor then—we saw him in the course of the morning—an application was made to the Lord Mayor that the barges might be returned to the Waterman's Company—Mr. Dadd and a gentleman made the application to get the barges restored—the Lord Mayor refused to do that—only myself and the two persons I have alluded to, attended on that morning—I made a complaint, not in the presence of those parties—I re<lb/>ported what I had done, and what had taken place, to the Lord Mayor, in his private room, before any application was made by Dadd—Mr. Dadd also saw him in his private room, with me—Dadd was called in after I had re<lb/>ported to the Lord Mayor—I do not understand that the Lord Mayor gave any judgment about it—he gave me no orders to restore the barges—he said he would not restore the barges—he told Mr. Dadd he would not restore the barges—he certainly did not deny that it was by his orders that the barges had been removed—I saw there were men on board the steamer, No. 5—John Moore and Pearce went on board the steam-vessel, No. 5, and forced their way on board—I am speaking of my own men—I do not remember any of the other names—I believe Moore was one of the men who took possession of the first dummy opposite Jeckon's wharf—I will give the names as well as I can—I cannot from my own knowledge give any of the names of the men who were engaged in the struggle for taking possession of the second barge—I am not aware of any further state<lb/>ment being made to the Lord Mayor, except my report of the morning what had taken place—I did not charge Dadd, or any of them, with the riot when he was present—I merely reported what had occurred—when this pier is out it is opposite a wharf called Needham's wharf—I did not lay informa<lb/>tions against the parties—under the waterman's bye-law there is a fine which the City of London can inflict for laying things in the river—I believe the fine is only 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I never laid an information—to the best of my recollec<lb/>tion, it was about eleven in the morning when the Lord Mayor came down—between that time and seven the next morning, when I attacked the barges I gave no notice, nor am I aware of any being given to the Waterman's Com<lb/>pany—I had not seen it used for a pier.</p>

               <p>have seen it there almost daily since—I gave the men 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for assisting me—I gave them that sum because it was a very unpleasant duty—it would not be any extravagant pay for a boatman for a day's job—I took that num<lb/>ber of men to prevent opposition, and to overcome it if I met with it—I had given instructions to the police to be ready to meet me there on the morning in question—I apprehend these barges are called dummies, because they are not used in the ordinary way of barges—I know no other reason—they are used as a sort of floating causeway to and from the steam-boats—when they at<lb/>tempted to get on board the steamers I merely saw a resistance to what they were about to do—I think there was no other violence than was necessary in order to prevent them coming on board at that time—I did not see what took place during the scuffle in getting possession of the barge—I could distinguish what took place on board the steamer—when my men got on board, I saw they were resisted both in coming on board and in getting possession of the wheel—I did not see any weapons used—I took the dummies to the Com<lb/>mercial Dock, to put them into a place of safety—I stated that I would speak to the Lord Mayor before I gave up either of the boats—I thought it was the best thing to do under the circumstances—I thought I should peril life if I resisted—I reported to the Lord Mayor, merely as the person who had given me my orders, to say what had been done, and I gave him a general report of what had taken place—I produced my warrant to Mr. Dadd before landing at the Custom-house stairs—he did not ask for it—I have never been asked for any—I have been water-bailiff twenty years—I should presume I am well known to everybody who goes on the river—I have acted many times before this in removing piles and other things—the warrant is signed by the Lord Mayor—the barges were eventually left by me at the Custom-house—I do not of my own knowledge know what became of them after<lb/>wards—I saw them afterwards above bridge, up at the pier again—that was the day before yesterday—the pier I saw next day was not made of the same barges.

                  </hi>. I am one of the water-bailiff's assistants. On the morn<lb/>ing of the 22nd of Jan., I went down to the place where the pier was—I had the water-bailiff's boat there to assist, at Paul's wharf-stairs—I was not on board the steam-tug, but in the skiff—I had the boat there in attendance—I had gone in the water-bailiffs boat—that is quite well known in the river as the water-bailiffs boat—there is "Water-bailiff, City of London," written on it—I have been water-bailiff's man many years—that is the boat generally used by the water-bailiff—I got to Paul's wharf-stairs at seven in the morn<lb/>ing—I saw the water-bailiff, Mr. Saunders, come, and heard him give orders for the men to proceed in taking the obstruction away—to take the pier away, which consisted of barges—they are only common barges, but when standing in this way are called dummies—they were fastened together at that time, as well as secured to the ground by mooring-chains, regularly moored—they were fastened together to make a platform in the regular way, and there was one on the upper side to be secured with chains from the ground, moored with anchor and chains from the ground—they were fastened to one another as well as moored to the ground—the first chain was fast to the wharf, on shore, and the next one fast to the other barge, and then there was a breast-chain on each side to keep her steady, that they should not carry people overboard—there was a mooring on each side, on the stairs, to keep her in that position, that she should not give way, to jerk people overboard—the dummies were fastened to the ground towards the wharf, and there was a fastening on each side of the dummy, to the ground, to keep her steady, as the case might be.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020072"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The fastenings on each side, that you speak of, are they usual fasten<lb/>ings for barges, or are they only necessary for a thing called a dummy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At times—these <hi rend="italic">growed</hi> there by stealth—they were placed there—there were none there before—they are usual fastenings—common barges do not have fastenings on each side, generally—these fastenings are used for barges of the same kind, in another ordinary way—if three or four barges lay together, they must be fastened on each side.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it usual for barges going to load and unload at wharfs, or to remain there some time, except used for the purposes of a pier or some such thing, to have fastenings athwart in this way? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, it is—if there are several barges, they are always moored at each end, or they could not keep them steady at each end to unload—a barge is generally fastened in the way this dummy was—I could tell this was intended for a pier by boards lying on the top, as a platform or stage for passengers to walk along, a platform for per<lb/>sons to walk to and fro from one dummy to another—when the water bailiff gave instructions to remove the obstruction the first thing I saw done was the rope and chain cast off—I did not assist—I was in the boat—they were cast off by some of Mr. Saunders's men, to take away—they cast off one of the dummies which laid adjoining the wharf, above the pier—they succeeded in that—I next saw the tug get hold of her, to make her fast, to take her away—the other persons there obstructed them from doing it, and a piece of work was created by the two parties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In what way did they obstruct them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Preventing them from taking the craft away—I did not see much force used—when they tried to remove the second, they flew over to it, and there was the same piece of work, and at that time I had orders to bring the police over—I took a boat full of police off to the steam-boat, to prevent the mischief that was likely to be done—I put them aboard the second dummy that was being cast off—they had not taken hold of the one I put them on board of, but they went on board with a view to quiet the piece of work, the riot that was breeding—when the police were on board, the other persons resisted the water bailiff's men, who were keeping the men belonging to the other party from using violence—I was not on board to see the violence that was used, but put the policemen on board to prevent mischief, and then I left them—I went back and brought some more—I did not see any violence used on board the dummies—I was not on board—I staid in the water bailiff's boat, with the view of taking care of her, and prevent myself being drowned by the boats and barges.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How near were you to the dummy with this boat when the men strove to get out of the boat, and take possession of the dummy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the boat, two or three yards from the dummy—I had not a boat's load—the water bailiff's men were aboard of the tug, not in the boat with me—I was alone in the water-bailiff's boat at the time—I went and fetched the policemen, and put them aboard my boat off the stairs—before I fetched the policemen I was really doing very little with my boat, for there was nothing to do, the action had begun before—I saw the action begin—I was there when a jangle took place with the parties—I do not know that there was ever a boat attacked the second dummy—it is out of my power to tell you whether the crews of the boats attacked the dummy—I do not think we had as many as thirty men—I did not count them—I could not swear there were twenty—I cannot swear how many axes and crow-bars and chisels there were in the hands of the men who tried to board the dummy—there were not a good many that I am aware of.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the water-bailiff's men. On Thurs<lb/>day morning, the 22nd of Jan., I went in a steam-tug to Paul's-wharf by di<lb/>rection of the water-bailiff—when I arrived there I saw a steam-boat and a barge—the barge was lying on the causeway, in and out, and the steam-boat <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, No. 5, was lying outside of her—Kinchin had charge of her—I knew him by sight—I cannot say how many men he had with him on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>—I went into a Peter-boat, to take one of the barges away which was at the upper side of the causeway—it was a barge that I had seen out for a pier—it had no planks on the deck—it was an open barge for people to walk along to go into the steam-boats—there were no planks for people to walk across—they walked along the flooring of the barge—I had seen it erected out as a dummy before, but at that time it was moored, like any other barge, fast to another barge—it had no platform on it—there was another dummy at the lower side of the stairs—we took the first away, and afterwards went to take the second—I got knocked down as soon as I stepped into her—there might be twenty people on board that barge—there were a great many—I got a punch in the mouth, which knocked me down—I could not swear to the man who knocked me down—I got up, and was knocked down again—I cannot exactly say by whom—I might know the man if I was to see him—that is the man—(<hi rend="italic">pointing out Ireland</hi>)—I did not see either of the others in that barge to my knowledge—I saw Dadd in the steam-boat, and Kinchin—Ireland was in the dummy—we succeeded in fast<lb/>ening the two dummies to the tug-steamer, and she began to go on, when Kin<lb/>chin ordered his boat, and she ran head foremost into us—he came between the tug and the dummies, and seperated the chains that we had got fast—we afterwards got the barges fust to the tug again, and he ran in a second time—he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020074"/>
               <p>did not separate them then—I cannot say of what power the steam-tug is—she is a smaller boat than the other—the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> is a good deal bigger—I cannot say whether she is double the size—she is a more powerful boat—she came with violence against us—that was calculated to put people in danger—I expected she would have sunk us—after that, we bore the steam<lb/>boat off, got away again, and then Kinchin came at us again, and ran us round, and backwards and forwards over the water, got foul and fixed in on us, and ran us where he liked, over and over round, about in the river—that was dangerous—had the tide been going down hard, instead of being high<lb/>water, very likely we should have gone athwart the bridge, or somewhere else, and smashed all that was in her—Kinchin was on the paddle-box all this time—I expect he was giving directions—we look for the man on the paddle-box to give directions—he appeared to be giving directions—I stepped on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi>, to try and clear the anchor, after he ran us round and round.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did you want to clear the anchor for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Only to get away from her, to get the barges down the river—I was merely going to lower it down a bit, so as to get the chains clear of it, so as he could not run us back<lb/>wards and forwards any longer—the chains of the barges in tow of the tug had got entangled with the anchor as he was running in between us—I did not succeed in clearing it—Dadd laid hold of a piece of iron, and threatened to knock me down with it if I touched the chain—I cannot say whether it was a part of the anchor I was going to lower, it was a piece of iron that he took off the deck of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> No. 5—I believe it was not part of the anchor that was hanging there—after she struck us the first time she backed her engines, and backed some distance from the burges, it might be five yards; she then came head foremost at us again at full speed—I should think she came as fast as I had ever seen her go—I did not notice whether her steam was blowing off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>before I stepped on board—we said nothing to them, or they to us, before I stepped on board—they tried to keep the boat off, so as we should not step in—they shoved it off with staves, and tried to keep it off with their hands—I cannot swear there was any staff used—I jumped forward, and jumped out of her as soon as she made one push, so I was the first man out of the barge, and the first that was knocked down—that was with a first, which hit me in the mouth—I did not hear the men in the dummy say, "Don't come here, or we must push you off"—I said nothing to them—I jumped on board as soon at I could, and then I was knocked down—I rose up, and endeavoured to get for<lb/>ward to get the chains undone—I struggled to get on—I pushed my way for<lb/>ward to get to the chains, to let her go.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> And it was in pushing your way forward that you was pushed down again? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, it came too heavy for a push—a man named Flynn got on board with me at the same time—I did not use any axe, crowbar, or chisel—I do not know whether any were taken—I took none—I saw some, but I did not use any, or take any—I do not know that the men in the boat had them—I saw one on board the <hi rend="italic">Waterman's</hi> boat—I did not see any in our boat—I saw people on board the barge with choppers—I cannot say whose men they were, for as soon as ever the boats were got there I had no more to do with them—I was ashore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You saw some one with an axe in his hand on board the dummy? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see him using it—I saw it lying in the steam-boat—I never saw it used on board the dummy—I cannot say that I saw it on board the dummy—I was not directing the course of the boat I was in—I was standing on the boat's head, and two other men were rowing it—there might have been eight or ten men in the boat—they all jumped on board the dummy at soon as they could—it did not make any <hi rend="italic">row</hi>—I called out to them to assist me, and they did—I did not see three other boat loads—the struggle lasted some minutes—it might have been ten minutes before they got the barge away—I did nothing at all to the men to get them out—I did not see anybody throw them into barges on either side—I did not see anybody thrown out.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of the City police—by order of my superintendent I attended with twelve police-constables at Paul's-wharf, on Thursday morning, the 22nd of Jan.—I arrived there about ten minutes before seven o'clock, and met Mr. Saunders at the top of the stairs—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer, <hi rend="italic">No.</hi> 5, lying outside the piles by the causeway, athwart the pier and public stairs—I did not see Kinchin at that time—I did shortly afterwards on board—I knew him, and know that he commanded that vessel—shortly after I saw the steam-tug come under the arch of Southwark-bridge—an soon as I saw it, Kinchin gave orders for his vessel to go ahead—she was then laid right on the cross way in front of the stairs—a hawser was thrown from</p>

               <p>her, round the upper pile, to moor her to the stairs—I do not know the power of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman, No.</hi> 5—she is considerably larger than the steam<lb/>tug—I noticed at that time only about three or four men on board—there were several came out of the shed on the pier, and went on board the barges—that was just after the tug came through the centre arch of Southwark<lb/>bridge—I should say there were about twelve or fifteen, or something of that sort—I did not notice any persons go on board the Waterman, No. 5—I did not at that time notice whether the men who came out of the shed had any<lb/>thing in their hands—I did afterwards when the water-bailiffs' men were try<lb/>ing to get away the second barge from the wharf—I then saw Sinclair with a hatchet—he had it up in a striking attitude—he aimed it at one of my men in the barge—I called him by name while he was holding the hatchet, and said, "Sinclair, mind what you are about, I am here"—at that time one of my men had him by the tail of the coat—when the water-bailiff came up he asked me for four policemen—he went away with them in the boat from the stairs—how he disposed of them I cannot say—the water-bailiffs men eventually succeeded in removing the other barge—they proceeded to break away the chains for the purpose of removing the barges—they were resisted—I saw the barges got away, and both of them fastened to the steam-tug—the steam-boat then turned towards the wharf, and immediately after that went right in between the tug and the barges, and snapped them asunder—at that time there were ten policemen on board the barges, or dummies—they are barges planked over—I only speak of the one I saw taken away—I did not see the first taken away—the one on which the policemen stood was planked over, and had rails such as are placed on dummies to form temporary piers—it appeared to me that the parties were in danger after they were separated from the tug.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How did you succeed in getting to the head of the vessel, and getting possession of it, without any violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> By standing round—we surrounded them—we stood round and kept them at bay—we were ordered to use no violence—I had a staff—I did not have it out—we took away the barge—the men in it used much violence—they came round and told us to get off, that as it was their property, or they would sink the b—y lot—as soon as I was struck and I managed to get on to the dummy, the next policeman that came up, Mackay caught hold of his legs and <hi rend="italic">chucked</hi> him down on to the dummy—I had recovered my breath at that time—I do not think our party used the least violence—I saw one or two with their staves out who got ill used—I did not see the men who went with me to take possession of the barge, use any violence—they got rid of the fifty men by standing round—they got off to this next place that was standing here, (<hi rend="italic">referring to plant</hi>) and some got on to the steamer—there was a block which they were all standing round, with their axes and crowbars—the most violence they used was while they were trying to keep us off.</p>

I have never been examined anywhere before—I was not before the Lord Mayor or the Grand Jury—I went up to Mr. Pearson's—I first got on board the boat at Paul's-wharf, and went down the river to meet the steam<lb/>tug—Hutson was one of the party in the boat—Mr. Pearce was with us, to give us orders—we had received orders from our in<lb/>spector—Mr. Pearce gave directions as to where our boat was to go—we met the steam-tug on this side of Southwark-bridge—it was not overlight—it was between the two lights—it might be a little after seven o'clock—I went on board the steam-tug, and remained on board—I saw the first dummy taken away and attached to the tug—after that I got into the boat with Hutson again; perhaps there might be a dozen of us got into that boat, I cannot say, ten or a dozen—by that time it had become light enough to see what was going on on the second dummy—I can't say whether any persons were put on board the dummy—as we were going up nearly close to it I saw persons running in all directions, and I should say there might be about twenty—there were persons on board the dummy who said, "Keep off"—I was <hi rend="italic">shoved</hi> back with a stick—they were standing on the dummy to prevent our getting on it—I cannot say whe<lb/>ther our boat was the first that got to it—I cannot say whether there were three or four other boats, or how many there were—there were parties got out of the tug into one more boat, but whether there were any more I cannot say—I did not see so many as four or five boats, I should think, start from the tug to go to the dummy—after I was shoved buck with the stick I rose again,</p>

               <p>and succeeded in getting on the dummy—I do not mean to say that I recog<lb/>nise the person who shoved me back with the stick—I can swear to Mackay being the person that took hold of my legs, because I had hold of his collar when I fell, and he caught me by the legs, and I caught hold of him as I was falling—I had never seen him before, to my knowledge—a minute or two be<lb/>fore, I had—he had got something in the shape of a handspike—he was endea<lb/>vouring to prevent me from getting in—he did not do anything to me, because I was shoved back in the boat, and when I got up again he had not the hand<lb/>spike in his hand—it was not him that pushed me with the stick—I saw him distinctly as I approached, with the handspike in his hand—I lost sight of him when I was pushed back—I had sight of him until I was pushed back—the instant I jumped up he seized me by the legs—Hutson and I were both sit<lb/>ting on one seat in the boat—he disembarked first—he did not succeed in getting on the dummy before I was struck—we both rose together—Moore was on the dummy, and Hutson was in front of the dummy by that time—there were several of us down on board, I suppose he went to some of their assistance in front of the dummy—after we were assaulted, I saw the men go to assist the men that were down, to keep the peace—as soon as they got on board the dummy they were knocked down—Moore was down at the same time I was—they resisted us all they could—they pushed us back again—they resisted us in every way they could—pushed us off—they used greater force than we did—they used the first violence—we used no violence—I was down, and when I got up again they were up at the head of the dummy—nearly all the men who had been protecting it were off—perhaps I might have been down two or three seconds—the struggle on the dummy did not last ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, but they got on the barge, and got back again on the dummy—they tried to get possession of it again, and to resist all they could—the water-bailiff's men finally got possession—we were only standing there—I assisted the water-bailiff's men in keeping the people off—I stood before them—I had not got my staff in my hand—they were pushed—there was a great scuffle between the parties—I certainly pushed them, not with any violence—it did not require me to use violence to prevent them from com<lb/>ing on—they resisted us very much when we first went to take possession of the dummy—we were obliged to use force to get them away—we lifted them off the dummy into the barges—I did not throw them into the barges—I took and put a man off the dummy into a barge—we took hold of them, and put them off from the dummy into the barge—I only did one myself—I lifted him on—I took him off and put him down into the barge—there were sides to it—it was an empty barge—he did not tumble down and fall on his back—he did not fall—the dummy might be three or four feet higher than the barge—I put him off into the barge—I went with him—he did not go gently and quietly, he was resisting—I do not know whether it required any particular strength to put him there—I did not strike him or anybody—I had not my staff out—he was the only person I touched—there were so many people there at the time that it is impossible for me to say whether I saw my brother con<lb/>stables lift other people into the barges—I did not see some of them tumble into barges on their backs, and my brother constables with them—nothing of that sort—I saw the men lifted off the dummy into the barges—there might be four or five—I cannot say who lifted them off—they might be some of the water-bailiff's people—I did not notice any one particularly—I did not see the people lifted up and thrown into the barges by the dredger-men who came from the tug—I did not see any of them tumble—they were all strug<lb/>gling with those engaged against them—that was the way in which we finally got possession of the dummy—I had never been concerned in anything of this</p>

               <p>kind before in the water—I had never done water duty before—I did not hear the men who were lifted off complaining that they were hurt—I did not help to undo the chain—I believe it was cut asunder—I saw one chain out with an axe—I cannot say who cut it—I should say it was some of the water-bailiff's people—it was one of the chains that fastened the dummy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe they had several axes and crowbars and chisels to undo the chains, had they not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see any—I saw one on the dummy—how it came there I do not know—there might have been time to get off the dummy after Kinchin made use of the expression I have named about sink<lb/>ing us, before he ran across the chain, and if there had been any boats close by I would have got off, but I could not—it was not two minutes after giving us the warning that he ran athwart the chain, and broke it and the ropes—he went back some distance, not so far as 200 or 300 yards—there was no boat near to get on board of—Hutson could not have attempted to get on board the tug—it was a thing impossible—if he had tried to get there he must have gone into the Thames—he did not try to do so—it was no use, because the dummies were a few yards from the tug—there might be fifteen or twenty people on board the tug, or there might be more—I cannot say how many it would hold—I saw some pieces of wood, some handspikes, and something that appeared to me like a crowbar—I might see two or three pieces of wood—I did.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City police-constable, No.</hi> 567.) I attended at Paul's-wharf, on Thursday, the 22nd of Jan., about seven o'clock, or from that to half-past seven, I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer, No. 5, lying alongside the dummy—I was on the shore when I first saw her—I saw one of the barges which formed the pier removed—I then saw several men on the other dummy and come on to the dummy from the steam-boat, No. 5—when they were on the dummy I saw one had a handspike, and one had something else, I believe—I did not notice what it was—I saw Mackay, Sinclair, and Dadd—Mackay had the handspike in his hand—Sinclair had a hatchet—I saw Mackay strike at Hutson with the handspike, and hit him—he tried to prevent Hutson's getting on to the dummy a second time—he tried to strike him with the hand<lb/>spike—it was then that he hit him in the chest—he pushed him the second time—he might have had something in his hand—I did not see him strike him after he got on board—I saw Moore on the dummy, and saw him down, but I did not see who the scuffle was with—I afterwards assisted in removing the dummy which was taken in tow by the steam-tug—I was on the dummy at the time it was removed from Paul's-wharf—I went down the river in it some little way, and then went on board the steamer, No. 5, by the water<lb/>bailiffs orders—that was when we were out in the river, when the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> ran in on us and cut the barges from the tug—it then ran in again, and we were ordered to get on board to take possession of the steam-boat to prevent her coming forwards—I did not take possession of the wheel—a waterman, did—we kept them from the wheel—the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> was afterwards backed to the Surrey side of the river between Blackfriars and Southwark bridges—there were some coal-barges there—she was backed close along shore, so that</p>

               <p>any men might have jumped from the shore on to the steamboat—there were a good many men on the shore, and Kinchin asked them if they would come on board and throw these b—s overboard, and he would give them any money to do so—they were about to come on board, only we told them if they did they must put up with the consequences, and they directly said, "We will not run ourselves into trouble"—but I thought at one time several would have come on board—I continued with the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> till I was ordered by inspector Woodruff to come into the boat, which I did, and came to the tug.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Where was inspector Woodruff's boat when the chain was broken by the steamer No. 5? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was on the Thames—I can<lb/>not say whether it was dose to the barge, for I did not notice the boat—I should suppose he was not far off—I think there were several boats—I did not see the hands of the man at the wheel of the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> battered by anybody to get him to let go—he was not battered by any person—he was rather resolute, but they took him away—he was resisting—I saw no violence to him—they got him from the wheel—I saw what was done—I saw them take hold of his hands—I did not see one of the constables use a staff to batter the man's hands, neither did I see any of the constables with their staves out—I had not, nor did I see that any others had—I saw their hands when they forced the man away from the wheel—I will swear I never saw one with a truncheon in his hand at the time they got the man from the wheel, nor before—after they got him from the wheel I had my own truncheon in my hand, at the time they backed into the Surrey shore, to prevent the men from coming on board—that was the only time—that was after the man was got from the wheel—I do not know the name of the man who was put at the wheel after the other was got from it—he is a waterman, and is outside—there were several men on the dummy at the time we ap<lb/>proached in the boat, I should say four or five at the first onset—afterwards there were more—I cannot say how many there were when I got out of the boat—I cannot say there were so many as twenty—there might have been eight or ten, or not so many—there were not forty of us—I cannot say whether there were as many as forty in the steam-tug—they did not go with axes and crowbars—there was not one there—I should say the chain was cut—I saw it cut with an axe by one of the watermen—he had been in one of the boats, but not the same I was in—he was in the dummy when he cut it, but whether it was an axe he brought, or whether it was brought there by the other party, I cannot tell—I saw a crowbar in Dadd's hand on board the steamer—they tried very much to prevent our getting on board the dummy—they did all in their power to prevent us, but we got on board in spite of it—I saw one or two of the men thrown into barges alongside—I cannot say, in the scuffle, who took them up and threw them in—they both fell together—I suppose the barge might be about six feet deep—I did not see any of our men lift any of them into the barge—the piece of wood that Mackay had in his hand was a long piece, thick at one hand, and thin at the other—I did not know what it was till I was told it was a handspike by one of the watermen—I described it to the Lord Mayor—when we were approaching the dummy I heard the words, "Keep off"—I should say the men rowing the boat did not slacken their speed when that was said—I cannot say that they went on the faster—they went on at the usual pace—I did not notice any difference—I got on board the dummy—I was at the head, and I put my hand to prevent Mackay from any violence, keeping the peace—I told them not to be foolish and run themselves into trouble—I told Mackay so for one, and all those who came from the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamer—they went away when they were compelled to</p>

I was in different positions on the morning of the 22nd of January during this transaction—I saw the <hi rend="italic">Waterman</hi> steamboat No. 5 run in between the steam-tug and the two dummies—I saw it done, I think, four times—I was one of the parties who afterwards boarded the <hi rend="italic">Water<lb/>man No.</hi> 5—I saw Captain Kinchin on board when I got there—I said to him, "Kinchin, I am on my official duty; mind what you are about; you are ob<lb/>structing me in my duty; I am acting under the Lord Mayor's orders"—he said he was determined to have the craft, meaning the dummies, I suppose—I am pretty well known on the river as assistant to the water-bailiff—I have occasionally removed piles and obstructions on the river during the time I have been in office.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a distiller, and live in Albany-street, St. Pan<lb/>cras—part of my premises are occupied as a distillery, and another part as a private house—this plan (<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>) is a perfectly correct representation of the premises—there is a doorway in the centre of the building leading to the kitchen, a door leading to the distillery, and another leading to the private house—the pantry in which the plate was kept is at the end of the dwelling-house, and over that the servant's bed-room—there is a water-closet at the bottom of the stairs, and above the covered way is a passage leading to a door which is usually open—a person going along the passage could go through that door, and get to the other side of the house—the prisoner Edward Plowman was my butler—his bed-room was on the distillery side of the house—there is a flight of stairs leading from his bed-room, and a water-closet at the bottom of those stairs—the centre gate is always kept locked at night, and the porter keeps the keys—the door on the right hand side, leading to the private house, is usually kept locked at night—it is the butler's duty to lock that every night, and to hand the key to the porter, or put it in the porter's room—there is plate kept in the butler's pantry—Edward Plowman would have no business whatever in my private dwelling-house after the house was shut up—there is nothing to bring him there except for private purposes of his own—on the</p>

               <p>24th of Dec. I left town, with Mrs. Grimble—before doing so, while the pri<lb/>soner was clearing the breakfast things away, I took a gold watch and stand, in his presence, off the mantel-shelf, and put it in the left hand sideboard drawer—there are other drawers to the sideboard, but they contained nothing of value, and were not locked—I locked the one I put the watch in—there was a desk in the room—I did not see anything done to that before leaving town—our housekeeping money was usually kept in that desk—Edward knew that well—he had fetched 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that morning from the counting-house for housekeeping, by an order from Mrs. Grimble—I did not see him fetch it, or give it to her—I returned to town on Friday, 26th of Dec, and remained in town two or three hours—the house was then as I had left it—I was in the dining-room, and I think I went to the sideboard drawer, but I am not cer<lb/>tain—I went out of town again, and returned on the 29th—I found the side<lb/>board drawer broken open, and missed a gold watch, a gold chain, a breast<lb/>pin, and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money—the writing-desk was broken open—I went to the pantry, and found the articles stated in the indictment all gone—there is a private entrance to the dwelling-house, which has no outer key-hole—the key is always kept in the lock inside the door—there is a stove in the pantry, but there would be no occasion for a fire there during the night—there if a pipe from that stove, which goes through the servant's room, up to the ceiling—the rooms are twelve feet high—this plan is only the ground-plan, but the up-stair plan is exactly the same, and there is the same corresponding passage.</p>

                  </hi>. I am housemaid in Mr. Grimble's service—there is also a cook, two nursery-maids, a footman, and groom. On Sunday the 28th of Dec, at ten minutes after ten o'clock, I let the groom out of the kitchen—he went to his cottage where he sleeps—the porter, the cook, the prisoner, and myself, were then in the kitchen until half-past—we then all left the kitchen together to go to bed—the porter went to his lodge, and the prisoner went to his pantry—I and the cook bid him good night as he went to his room, and we went to bed—I did not see him go to his room—we passed the pantry where he was, and bid him good night—he was not in the pantry, but against the stairs, when we went to bed—he went towards the pantry—after being up stairs some time, I heard a small knocking—I afterwards went to sleep, and was awoke by the cook—the first noise I heard was a kind of whispering after we awoke up—I got up and opened the room door, and heard somebody come from the hall to the pantry—that was just upon twelve o'clock—I then locked the door again—I afterwards went down stairs, and when I entered the hall I heard the pantry-door open, but did not stop to see who came out—I went to the porter—I afterwards went to the prisoner Edward's room, and found his bed had not been touched—I had made the bed in the morning, and it was as I had left it in the morning—I then went along the private passage to the other side of the house where the family reside, but still on the ground<lb/>floor—I there saw the prisoner Edward, three or four stairs from the ground<lb/>floor—I mean the stairs opposite the private front door—he was coming down—I asked him what he did there—he said that he had heard somebody in the house—I said, "What do you do here?"—he then said he had come to the water-closet—I asked why he did not go to the one which was nearer his bed-room—there is one very near his room—he made no answer—the porter proposed that I should go and call the clerks—the prisoner said he would go—I went to Edward's room afterwards—I then found the bolster had been pulled out of its proper place, but the bed did not appear to have been slept in—it was different to what I had seen it just before—he said several times that he had been to bed—I said he had not—I had seen the silver cups and castors on the Saturday—Edward was cleaning them.</p>

                  </hi>. I am porter to Mr. Grimble. On this Sunday night I went to sleep at the lodge about half-past ten o'clock—Edward was with me that night—I saw him go into the dining-room—he did not pass by my lodge to go to bed—he would have to do so—the housemaid came and awoke me, and on getting up I saw the prisoner Edward on the dwelling side of the house, the private part—I afterwards told him he had not been by my room, and he said he had—it was his duty to lock up the house, and he should have hung the key up in the lodge, which is my room—he did not bring it that night—I found it afterwards in the door—that is the key of the side door, which leads to the archway—I should say, from his appearance, that he had not been to bed that night—he was dressed, except his coat—I said he had not been to bed—he replied that he had, and said, "If you look you will find my watch under the pillow"—I afterwards went to his bed-room—his bed had then been disturbed on the top, but nobody had been in it—the front street-door key was asked for, and he produced it—he took it off the pantry-dresser—there were a number of keys alongside it, which I had never seen before, and did not belong to the house—I also saw a chisel, screw-driver, file, and three masks on the table—I went out for a policeman, and in coming back, near the private door, I heard the bolts unfastened, as I thought, and was waiting to see somebody come out, but, instead of being unfastened, it was being bolted inside—this was before the key of the street door had been found.</p>

I have known the prisoner William Plowman about fifteen months—he lent me a sovereign on Saturday morning, the 27th of Dec—I paid him back the same day—I never lent him money—on the Sunday night after Christmas-day I went out with him, about eleven o'clock, as near as I can tell—he asked me to go, and said he was going to meet a friend—we went up Drury-lane, and the New-road, to the Fitzroy coffee-house, Tottenham Court-road, near the New-road—he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. there to pay for coffee, as I had no money—he merely, went into the house, but did not stop himself—he said he was going to meet a friend, and would be back in about an hour, and desired me to stop there till he returned—I had a little dog with me, and was outside looking for it, about twenty or twenty-five minutes past twelve o'clock, and William Plow<lb/>man</p>

               <p>(The prisoner put in a written defence, stating that she had purchased the carpet on the 15th of Oct. of a person who had formerly been charwoman where she had been in service, and gave it to a man named Dennis to beat.)</p>

I am a labouring man and a porter—I live in Tower-street, Seven Dials—the prisoner hired me to beat a carpet for her on Thursday, the 16th Oct., about five o'clock—I am certain of it—I know it was on the 16th of Oct., by my recollection—I fetched it from her lodging on the 16th, and took it and beat it on the 17th—I know it was on the 16th I had it by my memory—there was nothing else that I did the same day that I know of—I often beat carpets when anybody gives me a job—I know the prisoner by sight, nothing further—I should know the carpet—it was a kind of blue ground—it was very much worn on one side—I beat it almost to rags on one side—I can swear that this is the carpet I beat for her.</p>

I keep the Barley Mow, in Salisbury-square—On the 15th of Dec., about six or seven o'clock in the evening, the prisoner applied for accommodation—she came with luggage, and presented the appearance of a respectable person—she was allowed to have the use of the bar parlour, which would enable her to be separate from the other persons in the house—a Mr. Clarkson was a visitor at my house at that time and subsequently—a person came to see the prisoner after she was there—I went into Yorkshire, and returned on the Saturday following, which was on the 20th of Dec.—the gentleman who visited the prisoner was in the habit of coming to the house up to the 19th of Jan.—I never observed any impropriety on the subject of his visits—on the 20th of Jan. the prisoner said in my presence that she expected her sister from South Petherton, in Somersetshire, to come up by the Great Western Railway that evening—(she had told me when she came to my house that she was from South Petherton)—I was not aware at that time that she had sent her things away that morning—she gave directions that a bed should be provided for her sister, and the fire kept in the commercial room, as no doubt she would be cold on her arrival—I am not aware that tea was ordered for her—she said she expected her sister by the half-past nine train that</p>

               <p>deed—(<hi rend="italic">letter read</hi>)—"Southall Park, Aug. 12, 1845. My dear Sir,—I thank you for your kind offers of assistance in any matters relative to your dear cousin and myself. There is one little affair in which you can most essentially serve me, and I am sure you will not refuse. When I first addressed dear Mary, I assure you it was not with the most remote wish or thought, that with her I should receive one sixpence fortune; however, from Lady Ellis's kindness and consideration this will not be the case; and as I do not like to be altogether thought in<lb/>sensible of appreciating her ladyship's liberality, and also as I wish to pro<lb/>vide in the best way I can, although but a humble one, for dear Mary's future comfort, will you, but I know you will, give me your opinion upon the fol<lb/>lowing proposal. Under the will of her mother, my late wife was entitled to 916<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., (I think the shillings are right, I know the pounds are,) pay<lb/>able on he death of her father, now sixty-eight, and also to one-third share of two shares in the Barnsby Canal, (present price each 280<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.) This of course is mine at the death of Mr. Armstrong. I propose that you would draw out a deed expressive that the above properties should be placed in the hands of trustees, (I submit that yourself and Mr. Henry Wood should be named, if you both will undertake the office,) the interest for our mutual benefit da<lb/>ring our lives, and, at the death of us both, that the principal should be divided equally amongst as many children as may be living. I should also wish that a clause should be inserted, saying, that upon the consent of myself and dear Mary, and the two trustees, that it shall be possible to give up to us 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the sum—I will just explain my reason for this wish. As far as we can see at present, prosperity is with us in the world, but God only knows what is in store for us; it may be that hereafter misfortunes may occur, and I think that with that sum at our command we could, by perseverance and industry, perhaps redeem our lost position. Now, will you candidly tell me, have I put my wish in a manner likely to suit the interests of dear Mary? any suggestion from you to alter the plan, believe me, I will receive most thankfully; my only object is to make a provision against possible, though, I trust, not probable adversity. One favour in addition I have to ask, your perfect silence on the subject. I have not as yet told Lady Ellis; I may or may not, but to dear Mary I mean it to be an unexpected marriage-gift, when I place the deed in her hands on our return from church. If you will let me know how much the stamps will cost I will send or call with the amount; the sum altogether will be nearly 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; not much of a settlement, you will say, but my only excuse is that it is the best I can do. Perhaps you will be good enough to let us hear from you in a day or two, at your convenience. I men<lb/>tioned to Lady Ellis that I was about writing to you, and she desired me to say that little Willy is very well and happy, and has expressed his intention of going with her ladyship to chapel on Sunday. I fear my long letter must have tired you; so, with every wish and prayer for the health and happiness of yourself and family, request you to believe me most faithfully yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">RICH<lb/>ARD COOKE</hi>."</p>

Dear Sir,—I yesterday addressed a letter to your son, with proposals to bring to a close our present unfortunate situation; and my object in writing to you now is, that you will kindly lend us your assistance towards the accomplishment of such a desirable event. You will perhaps think it rather a bold request on my part after the letters I have addressed to you, but I trust that you will in your goodness forgive the part, as I assure you that nothing but downright starvation staring us in the face could have prompted me to such a measure on my part. I am willing to re<lb/>peat any apology you may suggest, or sign any one you may require. I will inform you the terms on which I rely on your interference and favour in our behalf.

The man<lb/>ner in which I propose expending it is as follows: 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the purchase of a business, which I can complete under most favourable circumstances, at Cob<lb/>ham, in Surrey; 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be paid to your son, which he advanced us since the disposal to him of Mrs. Buosseto's legacy; and the remainder to purchase whatever stock may be wanting, and necessaries attending our removal. In return for this, I propose that Bessy shall settle the whole of the remainder of her property, both in possession, or which hereafter she may be possessed of, to heir or heirs, and you in trust for the benefit. The day after this deed it signed I will marry Bessy, and then I trust an end to all our troubles. The business at Cobham is a most excellent one, and the purchase-money includes shop fixtures, a bottle stock (not very large,) and a good portion (one sitting and two bed-rooms full) of household furniture. The 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I propose paying off at the rate of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per annum, so that in four years we shall be free. The rent is only 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a good house, shop with every convenience for business, and no opposition, with 2,300 inhabitants, with my attention and qualification for business, I think I can appeal with confidence even to you—as to my success in Bath, it will prove what my assiduity and patience effected. You may say, on reading this letter, if my intentions are honourable, why not marry Bessy before this settlement is made? I will tell you—owing to my insol<lb/>vency, were I to do so, my former creditors could claim every sixpence of Bessy's property in liquidation of their debts, to the amount of 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. This I am sure you will see with me is best avoided. Now, sir, that I have pointed out to you the bright side of our prospects, I will state the dark side. To rescue us from our late distressed and dreadful condition we are determined to do something. If your son refuses his sanction to the mortgage, Mr. Binns has a purchaser for the whole of the reversion, with all its faults, for 466<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; and, with a full knowledge of the consequences, Bessy will sell it. In every money transaction with you and your son I have taken from Bessy a written consent and authority for the act, indemnifying me from all consequences. We have laid the whole case before counsel, and are aware that if you and your son can prove that you were not aware of our living together unmarried, we are liable to be indicted; but the greatest punishment that would be awarded would he six or twelve months'imprisonment. Now, sir, this, for the sake of hereafter providing for ourselves and poor children (three and another coming) we are prepared to undergo: you can only punish us once, and then Mrs. Bousfield's legacy will also be Bessy's. Now, sir, I implore you to pause before you consign your child and me to a dungeon, and my poor old mother and the poor children to a workhouse. For your child's</p>

               <p>welfare I am sure I need not plead, as her affection for you has ever been in the extreme, and her love for you even now greater than for any one on earth. As to myself, I believe I was not mistaken when I reckoned upon you as my best friend, with your son, and I was only sorry that I could not do more to prove my gratitude than lay in my power. We throw ourselves upon your and your son's power; and may the Almighty God incline you to be merciful towards us. If not, do not think that we shall shrink from our purpose—we shall not, for imprisonment will be far, far better than the penury and wretchedness we have suffered the last eighteen months. In case your son should not be<lb/>lieve my statements, I have sent him the agreement for the sale of the busi<lb/>ness to me, and the authority sent to Bessy by Mr. Binns for the sale of the reversion. In conclusion, let me beg and pray of you to grant us your in<lb/>terference and favour; and in the hope that you will write to me by return of post, I am, dear Sir, yours, &amp;c, <hi rend="smallCaps">R.

On Saturday evening, Jan. 3, about half-past five o'clock, I saw Bell in New-street-square, with a heavy roll of lead on his shoulder—I stopped him, and asked him where he was going to take it—he said, "I am going to take it there," point<lb/>ing to No. 29, Newstreet-square—I asked where there—he said, "To Mr. Bell"—I asked where he brought it from—he said it was right enough, and for our satisfaction he would take us to his master's—another officer joined me, and we went to No. 12, Chichester-rents, where the prosecutor's shop is—before we got quite up to the shop Bell remarked, "Here is our shop," and when we got to the shop he pointed to Tiswell and said, "There is my master"—he called him up to him, and said he had been stopped by two po<lb/>licemen—I said we had stopped him, as we were aware there was a great quantity of lead stolen, and that we had now come round to ascertain whether or no his statement was correct—Tiswell remarked that it was right enough; that it was sent down to Mr. Bell's to be worked up on Monday morning—I asked if he was that party's master—he said he was—I asked him if he had entrusted him with the lead—he said he had—he then asked us back to a small room at the further end of the shop—when we were got into that, I remarked that if it was right we did not want anything more, but that it ap<lb/>peared to me to be a private house where the lead was going to, and asked for what purpose the lead was taken there—after hesitating a little while, he remarked to me that he declined to answer that question—I do not think there was a blind to the shop window—when we were coming away I said</p>

               <p>they might probably hear more about it—the name of "Stone" was on a pane of glass in the window, and Tiswell said, "There is my name"—I asked how long he had been in business there—he said, "About nine years"—we let Bell go, and followed him—he took the lead to No. 29, New-street-square—in consequence of information we went to that house the same evening, and in the front room on the first floor, we found the same lead—we brought it away—we took Tiswell into custody about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock the same night—he asked for what I was wanting him—I remarked, for dis<lb/>posing of property which was not his own, and I believe I remarked "lead" to him—as we were proceeding to the station he remarked that Mr. Mas<lb/>kell, in looking over the papers or the books (I am not sure which) would see it was not so bad as he thought it to be—when we got to the station he was questioned by the station-sergeant, who had a pen in his hand, but I do not believe he wrote down the questions he put to the prisoner—he asked him how he came to represent himself to be master of the place—he replied, "To save" or "screen the man."</p>

Toy and Anson—I saw three of them, in particular, safe on the 14th, at eleven o'clock, on the bench by my desk, at the top of the factory, in the shop where they work.</p>

               <p>as foreman—we have, perhaps, twenty men in the shop, they had equal access to these articles in the shop, not in the warehouse—I can identify three of these articles as having been in the warehouse—I gave out two dozen articles similar to these for the men to work on—if these are not similar, they are the same—they may be the same, but I am sure these three were on the bench that morning—they were not given out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am foreman to Mr. Charles Spiers, a silk manufacturer, in Spital-square. The prisoner has been employed by him as a silk-weaver between two and three years—he wove hat-bands and galloon—he absconded somewhere about the 30th of May or 2nd of June, 1845—he did not return—on the 15th of Jan. I delivered him some materials to manufacture—this is my writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a book</hi>)—I delivered him sufficient silk materials to manufacture 28 gross of satin bands, 3lbs. 14oz. in weight, that ought to have manufactured 28 gross—20 gross were manufactured, and that left eight deficient—the 20 gross were returned to Mr. Spiers—on the 22nd of March I intrusted him with sufficient to make 27 gross of galloon—he returned 18 gross out of the 27, leaving a deficiency of 9 gross—they have never been returned—on the 29th of March I intrusted him with silk materials sufficient to make 27 gross of silk galloon—18 gross were returned, 9 gross were deficient then—on the 22nd of April I delivered to him sufficient silk materials to manufacture 27 gross of silk—6 gross of them were returned, leaving a deficiency of 22 gross—I spoke to him about these things many times, and his answers were most vexatious and frivolous—sometimes he would say he had lost a brother, at another time that he had been in the hospital, and another time that he had a tumour on the breast, and many other frivolous things—they ought to have been returned in about five weeks after he had them out—on the 31st of May last, in consequence of information I received, I went to his house—I did not get admission then—on the 2nd of June I called again, but could not find him at home—I applied to the Magistrate at Worship-street for his advice, went down again, procured a ladder, got in, and lound Mr. Spiers's work cut entirely from the whole of the four looms which he had there employed for Mr. Spiers—I found</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, and live in High-street, Shoreditch; the prisoner was in my service as journeyman; it was his business to carry out the bread and receive money. I serve Mrs. Park with bread—it was part of tbc prisoner's duty to take bread to her, and receive money from her—her bill was sometimes paid weekly; sometimes it might go a fortnight, sometimes more, sometimes less—when he received money it was his duty to bring it back to me directly—he went his rounds, and after he had done serving the customers he came and paid me, or accounted to me for the money—on Saturday, before the 26th of Jan. I had a bill against Mrs. Park for 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the prisoner did not account for that—he did go for it I believe—it was his business to go for it—he never paid it me—I settled his book myself that day—I do not know whether he keeps a book himself—he does not produce one to me—I call the names from this book, and if any one has paid him he tells me and pays me—I called Mrs. Park's name on Monday 19th, and he said they did not pay—I asked him again on the Wednesday alter—he said she had paid 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he paid 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more to make up the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said nothing about the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the Monday—he said on the Wednesday that he had paid me on Mon<lb/>day—that was not true—I denied receiving it, and discharged him next day—the 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is marked off to Mrs. Park in the book; I cannot tell who by; I did not do it—no one had any right at my books, but they might do so without my knowledge—the prisoner came in at eleven o'clock on Wednesday evening, instead of returning after serving his customers—I said, "It appears you did not pay my father anything last evening, and now the names of three persons are erased"—he said, "Well, Mrs. Park I know paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the money, and I paid you 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I put 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more to it myself, to make the bill right"—he did not say to prevent a mistake—(<hi rend="italic">looking at his deposition</hi>)—I signed this, and it was read over to me—he might have said "to prevent a mistake," but I have no particular recollection of it.</p>

I am in the employment of Joseph Iron Winstanley, a hosier—on the 4th of Feb., at a quarter to seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with two more females, sometimes standing at the door, and returning in front of the window—one of them, not the prisoner, pulled these cashmere shawls down, which hung on an iron—they were all three together—I saw the girl hand them to the prisoner, who put them under her shawl, under her arm—I ran out and caught hold of both of them—the other got away—I kept the prisoner, she dropped the shawls—I took them up and gave them to the policeman.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable R</hi> 122.) On Monday afternoon, the 4th of Jan., I saw the three prisoners together, from half-past six to a quarter to seven o'clock—I first saw Mumford in Ayre-street, and then he joined the other two in Powis-street—I watched them—I saw the three walk toge<lb/>ther about fifty yards, to opposite Mr. Dixon's house—they stopped in close conversation, from five to ten minutes—Rend and Tapner went up Powis-street, and Mumford came down to nearly opposite Mr. Dixon's—I followed Reed and Tapner up the street, and they came down again the same side as Mr. Dixon lives—I saw them go to the door, and I secreted myself on the opposite side—Reed took something out of his pocket, and put it to the key<lb/>hole of Mr. Dixon's door—Tapner was standing by his side—Mumford was on the opposite side, walking backwards and forwards—he came to where I was—he gave a loud cough, and they both came away from the door—Mum<lb/>ford then went up Powis-street—I saw the other two about to leave the door—I ran across the road, and caught hold of them both—I said, "What do you do here?"—they said they had got a friend there, William Goodwyn—I gave one into the custody of a <hi rend="italic">civilian</hi>, a person passing by, and he took him to the station—I took hold of Reed's hand, which I saw him apply to the door, held his hand in his pocket, and took him to the station—at the station I took his hand, and two skeleton-keys out of his pocket—here are the two keys—(<hi rend="italic">producing them</hi>)—as we were going to the station, Reed threw some<lb/>thing away, and I told a boy to pick it up—it was brought to the station—I left the prisoner in the custody of the inspector, and went round the town in the direction Mumford took—he was making his way to London—I know him by his features and person—I had an opportunity of seeing him—he stopped under the gas-light.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 40, Church-street, Rotherhithe. I am the wife of Peter Stacey—we keep a beer shop—on the 20th of Jan., on going down stairs at night I noticed a door closed which I usually left open—I put my hand against it, and felt something against it, some resistance, something outside, and on my shaking it the handle of a broom fell—on open<lb/>ing the door there is a window, as you come to the bottom of the stairs, which shows light into the bar—I saw the gas alight, and saw a man standing with his back against the window, with somethings lying on the table, he appeared to see me because he ran right to the door and escaped—I think the door must have been on the jar, closed, but not latched,—I did not hear him lift the latch—he had no shoes on—he had on a round jacket, and a cap, and cord trowsers—the gas was burning in the room—I missed four sovereigns and 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of silver—I had left the money in a box, wrapped up in a piece of paper in a closet on the stairs overnight—some articles had been removed—a tea-caddy was taken off the mantle-piece with 1/2lb. of tea in it—I had seen the prisoner at our house the night before, but do not remember seeing him for several weeks before—I will not positively swear he is the man I saw in the parlour—but I have every reason to believe he is.</p>

I said, "I don't know, you had better call again," he went to the door and I had given information about him—I did not ask why he thought master wanted him—I thought he would run away if I questioned him—I could not detain him—I went immediately to the station—I was disturbed about a quarter past two o'clock in the night.</p>

I am secretary to the British Plate-glass Company; Mr. Thomas Cockburn is one of the proprietors, and there are several others; I live at Albion-place, Blackfriars-road, where the business of the company is carried on; the prisoner Charlotte Rand was cook in the family, and had access to all parts of the house. In consequence of information, I directed the officer to watch her, and on Monday evening the 5th of Jan, she was brought back to the door in custody—I went with her and the officer to the station, and after having been there I went with the officer to No. 32, Wel<lb/>lington-street, Waterloo-town, Bethnal-green—I there found Robert Rand—the officer stated to him that his wife was in custody for robbing me, and asked whether he had at any time received from her any articles that she had taken away, and whether he had any in the house—he stated certainly not, and he hoped I should be lenient with the woman; he had never received anything but a very few pieces of broken victuals—the officer said, "Well, I presume there will be no objection to searching the house?"—he assented, and we proceeded to search—in a desk in the lower room were these seventy-three postage-stamps—I cannot identify them—there were such articles amongst the property of the company—I cannot say that we have missed such—we have them in sheets—in the bed-room we found a quantity of paper and envelopes—the paper was of various qualities and descriptions, all of which are used by the company—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the articles</hi>)—this kind of paper the com<lb/>pany have from the manufacturer, at Maidstone, and this other from a dealer—we found 129 envelopes, some of which I had purposely made for the company—I think there were seven or eight screws of paper containing sugar, some loaf<lb/>sugar, some in powder, and some in lump—we keep our white sugar in powder—there was some black-lead, some mould candles, six or seven different bundles of scouring-paper, containing eight or nine sheets each, about 100 sheets in all; two large pans of butter, one plate, two dishes, and a soup-ladle—this is the plate—I know it; it has been with us fifteen or sixteen years—we found some kitchen cloths, some boxes of lucifer matches, and a knife and fork—I believe them to be my property and the property of the company—some of them I know.</p>

On the 20th of Jan., towards seven o'clock in the evening, I was on the back seat of a Dorking coach, passing along High-street, in the Borough—I turned round once or twice, and saw the prisoner hanging behind the coach—I took no notice of him at first, but he got up to the rail, and I felt my dress touched; and Mr. Cheeseman said to the prisoner, "That game won't do here, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>," and said to me, "Mrs. Caldecott, your dress if cut"—I found my dress and pocket were cut through, and I missed the thimble and other articles stated—the coachman pulled up directly, and Mr. Cheeseman got down and ran after the prisoner—I had not been on the coach above three or four minutes—my pocket was all right when I got on the coach, I am quite sure—my pocket was cleared of everything but a penknife, which was between the lining of my pocket—here is my dress, which is cut, and my pocket also.</p>

I went up stairs and saw my husband's watch safe in the bed-room—the prisoner was at that time gone out on an errand—I left the room, leaving the watch on the table, and put the clothes-basket at the room door, ready to be brought down—I went down and saw the prisoner put her hand to the mat at the street door, in order to shut it—I told her to take a can of water up stairs, put it down at the room door, and bring down the clothes-basket, but not to go into the room—she came down and I desired her to go for some honey to a shop over the way—I stood by the clothes-basket till she came back—she gave it into my hand and I sent her then to Mr. Bruton's mother's, No 30, Joiner-street—she went there to wash our clothes and took the clothes-basket with her—she left me about half-past ten o'clock, and was to remain there till dinner time—I went up stairs immediately, and my husband's watch was gone—I went up I am sure in one minute—there were other persons in the house—Mr. Bailey and his mother and sister, and one servant belonging to the house, whose name is Emma—she was in the coffee-room at the lower part of the house—I am not aware whether she left the house about that time—I very seldom saw the girl—I did not hear the street door shut or open during the time I was going up stairs—I was going to dress—I went straight to the table where the watch was—I am confident there was not time for any person to have gone out of the house in that short time—I could hear the street door shut or open in any room in the house—I am confident no one went out—when I missed the watch I went to Mr. Bruton, who was in the coffee-room, and he went to Joiner-street—I saw the watch produced by Mordy, the next night.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a nurseryman, and live in Camberwell New-road. On Saturday morning, the 17th of Jan., about a quarter to seven o'clock, I opened the gates of my nursery, which adjoins my dwelling-house—my house is in the nursery—I missed thirty standard rose trees, twenty-one peach trees, and three cytisus, which I had seen safe at six the previous evening, growing in the nursery—they were in an inclosed place—I gave in<lb/>formation to Kendall, and was with him on the Wednesday following, when the trees were found behind a house in which the prisoners live—they said they resided there—I found a label on one of the peach trees, which I knew—I can swear to it by that—there had been labels on the other trees, but they had been torn off—the trees themselves exactly correspond in size, number, and quality with those I lost—the peach trees were maiden trees, only grafted one year—I had had them from a gentleman in the country on the previous Thursday—I saw them all put into my ground, and I attended to them myself—I could swear to the trees being mine, independent of the label—these now produced are them—Raynes had worked for me for a short time about two years ago.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a journeyman gold-beater, and work for Mr. Seymour, at Peckham—on the 21st of Jan. I went with the prisoner to several public-houses, and afterwards went home with him to the factory, about half-past twelve—he said to me, "Will you work all night? I am going to work"—I said I would—we went into the shop, and he said, "I shall melt my stone-dirt"—he melted it, and there was 3dwts. 6 grains—he said, "That won't do, I must have more"—he then went to his box in which his <hi rend="italic">shruf</hi> was kept, took some gold out, weighed it, put it in, and melted it—there was 13 dwts. 7 grains, to the best of my recollection—he said that would do to pay for the funeral of his child, and get his wife a black gown—he told me on the Wednesday that he had asked Mr. Seymour to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he had refused, and he then remarked, "Well, he has refused to lend me the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I will have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth out of the old b—"—he went to town at four o'clock next day with his wife, and said he was going to sell the gold—I saw him again on Friday morning, and he asked me to go to Nunhead<lb/>cemetery with him about a piece of ground—at we were coming back he told me he had sold the gold, he had taken it to Mr. Groser first, and he refused to buy it, as it was between the lights, and he said, to the best of my recollec<lb/>tion, that he had sold it to Mr. Collingridge—I could not swear to the name, but it ended with a <hi rend="italic">ridge</hi>, and was in Wilderness-row—he said he got 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—he said to me, "I hope you will keep it <hi rend="italic">dark</hi>, for if you <hi rend="italic">come it</hi> I shall get <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>, and I should look pretty in chains"—I did not say anything about it on that account till I was on my oath before the Magistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you worked for a Mr. Laws? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I cannot tell why I left him, it is so long ago—I belive something was said about some silver concealed behind the weights—I was discharged on suspicion of that—I was discharged by Mr. Seymour's son on account of the work not turning out well—I did not take advantage of the prisoner being partially intoxi<lb/>cated, and melt this gold myself—I swear that—I sat down and smoked my pipe for about an hour, and had some coffee, and then went to bed—the dead child was in the next room—I was not astonished to hear such language as keeping it <hi rend="italic">dark</hi>, and bring <hi rend="italic">lagged</hi>, because I have heard it often before among gold-beaters—Mr. Seymour took me before the Magistrate—he said, "I want you to speak the truth, and nothing but the truth, and I hope you will answer"—I did not go till I was compelled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gold refiner, and live in Red Lion-street, clerkenwell—on the 21st or 22nd of Jan. I remember a short man cominginto my shop, about five o'clock, between the lights—he was about the heightof the prisoner, and his general appearance—I could not see his face distinctly—I was very busy at the other end of the premises, and finding he was a cus<lb/>tomer I did not like I got rid of him immediately—he put down a grain of gold—pushed it from me saying, "This will not suit me, neither the time of night nor the article"—he said something about lighting up—I said, "You</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184602020196"/>

                  </hi>. I am the prosecutor's son-in-law, and occa<lb/>sionally look after his business at Peckham—the prisoner has the sole charge of the gold delivered at that workshop—in Jan. I examined the gold deli<lb/>vered there, and found a deficiency of 3oz. 13dwts., which is worth about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I heard Mr. Seymour ask him if his work was up—he said, "No, not quite—I am a beating and a half deficient—I have done wrong—if you will look over it, I will work it out"—I went and fetched a policeman.</p>
