The object of the Company is the purchase or acquirement from time to time of leasehold, copyhold, or other land situated within the metropolitan district, and the erection thereon of dwellings for the labouring classes, and of buildings to be used as schools and working men's clubs—the capital is 250,0007., which was originally divided into shares of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each. Article of association 61 states that directors attending any meeting of the board shall be entitled to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as remuneration for their services—article 109 is as to the appointment of officers, and states that William Swindlehurst, of Kennington, shall be the first secretary, at a salary of not less than 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—on 21st December, 1869, special resolutions were passed, which were con<lb/>finned in January, 1870, and instead of the 109th section, in its original form, I find a resolution that the words "shall be the first secretary" shall be expunged, and the words "permanent secretary" inserted in their place—on 8th October a further resolution was passed, which was also duly confirmed and registered, "That the capital shall be increased from 250,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to a million"—the first list of share-holders is to December, 1868, and the last is to 1876.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an auctioneer, of 4, Whitehall—in 1874 All Souls' College, Oxford, entrusted me with some property close to the Harrow Road, consisting of seventy-one acres two perches—I advertised it for six weeks in all the principal London papers and in the local papers, the auction to take place in April, 1874—the property was divided into five lots—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my particulars of sale—lot 2 was sold to Messrs. Kelly, builders, for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit was paid and the contract signed—that consisted of sixteen acres, three roods, thirty-five perches—on 16th April, two days afterwards, Saffery called on me—refreshing my memory from my diary, I told him that the price of lots 1, 3, 4, and 5 as a whole would be 30,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and nothing less would be taken—those lots were not sold at the auction, as there was not sufficient bidding, and they were bought in—my impression is that Saffery said that he was looking out for an estate for a building society—he came again on 23rd April, 18/4, and I have entered, "Attending Mr. Saffery, when I told him the price was 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for lots 3, 4, and 5, and that a portion of the purchase money might be on mortgage; that I. would not negotiate with anybody else for one month, and that a deposit of 10 per cent. would have to be paid—the deposit was not for keeping it open—on 18th Hay I saw him again, and have entered, "Attending Mr. Saffery, when he offered to purchase lots 3, 4, and 5 for 22,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. if he Could purchase; lot 2 for 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.;" that was the lot we had sold to Kelly at the auction—on the 22nd I have, "Attending Mr. Longeroft with Mr. Saffry and Mr. Kelly, and conferring as to the proposed purchase of lots 3, 4, and 5, and the relinquishment of lot 2, agreed to defer matter till to-morrow for certain preliminaries"—Mr. Kelly had been in communication with Mr. Saffery on the subject of selling the lot he had bought, and I believe he wanted several thousand pounds as a profit upon the transaction, as he, being a builder, would lose his</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor, of 1, Clement's Inn, and have been in the profession eight years—I know the three defen<lb/>dants and also Mr. Lowe, who is not here—in 1869 or 1870 I was appointed solicitor to the Artizans', Labourers', and General Dwellings Company, Limited, through Mr. Swindlehurst's intervention, who was then manager and secretary of the Company—I had known him about a year before that—I did not know any of the other defendants before I was appointed—Swindlehurst was not a director when I joined, but he became a director about two years afterwards—from 1870 downwards he remained chairman—Mr. Lowe was a director when I joined, and continued so down to this prosecution, but he did not act on any committee that I know of—I do not know that there was a finance committee—I was aware during 1872 of business being done between Swindlehurst and Mr. Saffery in connection with the Shaftesbury Park estate—I have some notes here made by myself with reference to the Queen's Park estate—I do not keep a diary—the first entry I have is 19th May, 1874, "Attending Mr. Swindlehurst as to the purchase, conferring as to the arrangements, so as to attend to the different interests, and he is to see Mr. Saffery and see me again to-morrow"—I have no doubt Mr. Swindlehurst told me that it was proposed by the Company to buy the estate—I do not recollect whether Mr. Kelly's name was mentioned at that interview, but I believe it was—an arrangement was made for a meeting next day, and on 20th May I saw Swindlehurst again—he showed me the letter, which is in Saffery's writing—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 20th May, and signed Edward Saffery, offer<lb/>ing to sell the estate for</hi> 45,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to he paid on signing contract, and</hi> 16,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">to remain on mortgage at</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">per cent.</hi>)—my entry is" 20th May, at<lb/>tending Mr. Saffery, terms of agreement arranged, and I was to prepare contract"—I did not know then of the interest of All Souls' College in the property, or that it was passing through Messrs. Driver's hands—the contract was prepared on the 21st, and signed on the same day—I did not consult the board before preparing it—I do not think Saffery was present while it was being performed—on the same day I have "Attend<lb/>ing Mr. Swindlehurst at Westminster, long conference thereupon, and arrangement with Mr. Langley"—I have an item here saying that I attended Mr. Langley in an interview with Swindlehurst the same day, but I should not like to swear to it because these items are not always correct: they are entered every two or three days, and I have been in the habit of entering not only what took place, but what I intended to do—those entries were generally made within two or three days of the event—I have an entry in my diary of attending Mr. Langley at Lincoln's Inn Fields and arranging further, "and on the same day "Attending Mr. Saffery in the City, when it appeared there was a difficulty between him and Kelly us to this contract, which was not cancelled, and he will see me to-morrow morning"—I did not see the Harrow road property till</p>

               <p>my account I paid Mr. Driver by a cheque of my own on 3rd Sept.—Saffery said to Mr. Driver that it was subject to his previous contract, or words to that effect—I said of course, and he suggested that a memoran<lb/>dum should be entered on the contract signed by Saffery and myself—this is it—"I hereby consent to lot I being sold direct to the Artizans' and Labourers' Dwellings Company, subject to the terms of my agreement with the Company, Ed. Saffery"—Mr. Driver was there at the time of the conversation between Saffery and myself—I think the next money paid after that in respect of lot I was paid to the Copyhold Commission<lb/>ers—2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid to Saffery in respect of that on 13th Oct. by Swindle hurst's instructions—I received this cheque from Mr. Swindlehurst—<hi rend="italic"> (This was for</hi> 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">signed by J.

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> Sir Henry Lutes. I sometimes attended the board meetings, not often—I was aware that Mr. Walton was one of the directors, I learned that he had been a builder—the other directors, Mr. Hoskins, who principally attended, Mr. Russell, Mr. Lowe, and Mr. Langley, principally managed the Company—their object was to obtain property upon which cottages could be built for the poorer class of people who were dispossessed of dwellings elsewhere, where there was early commun cation with the places where they had to work—the Company increased in prosperity as it went on, and Mr. Swindlehurst apparently gave the whole of his time to its interests, he appeared to work hard and do his best—I know Mr. Mar in connection with the interests of the Company, he was a land agent or surveyor in the Adelphi—I don't re<lb/>member coming in contact with him, but I have known him very well by name, he was a person upon whom I would have relied—Mr. Walton also had, I believe, a sound practical knowledge of his trade—the first communication made to me as to Queen's Hall estate was on 19th May. 1874, by Mr. Swindlehurst, who was invariably the channel by which communications were made to me on behalf of the Company—I should have been surprised if I had received communications from anybody else</p>

               <p>—the letter of 20th May was the next thing brought to my attention—I had nothing to do with preparing that letter, that was the first I knew of it—I drew the memorandum of agreement of 23rd May—the wording is mine, I did not receive any directions as to the wording from Mr. Swindlehurst—the deposit money to be paid was 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 32,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at 10 per cent. on the 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. premium which Kelly was to receive for profit, so that the deposit of 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. had to be increased to 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I went to Mr. Driver's with Mr. Saffery—it was openly discussed that Saffery was making over whatever was his supposed interest in the Artizans' Dwellings Company, and that All Souls' College was to convey direct to the Artizans' Dwellings Company—I signed as representing the Artizans' Dwellings Company—there was no concealment—although Saffery had negotiated with Mr. Driver it was I who paid the 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there was no concealment about that—I was aware that Saffery had been the agent, and that he was standing out and letting me deal with Driver—there was no concealment about it—I had nothing to do with the negotiation between Saffery and Kellys as to that premium; but when I saw them at Driver's I knew that they were to obtain a premium, 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the auction was on 14th April—I knew they were going there to give up the purchase, but the consideration for doing so I did not know till 23rd May—I believe I gave the deposit direct to Kelly—I passed the 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. cheque through my bankers—they received the money from the Com<lb/>pany's bankers, crediting it to my account, and I drawing a fresh cheque—obtaining lot 2 was always necessary to the beneficial holding of lots 3, 4, and 5—lot I was an advantageous purchase in the sense of render<lb/>ing the rest more valuable—I received first 3,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. deposit, and afterwards a cheque for 11,912<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., out of which I paid 9,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. Saffery—every<lb/>thing I received went into the general account, mixed up with my other money, and for a certain time lay to my credit in my bankers' hands under my control, so that I could have drawn it out—I believe Swindlehurst told me the manner in which the cheque for 9,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be cashed; but I should not like to swear whether it was he or Saffery—I cannot remember telling the board that Saffery was receiving money for his interest in the re-sale; my belief is that they were aware of it, or else I should have considered it my duty to tell them—I had no desire to keep it from them, and I had every reason to believe they all knew it; the cheques were drawn for separate amounts—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is an agreement between Mr. Driver and Messrs. Kelly, by which Messrs. Kelly gave up lot 2 for a consideration of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which is a nominal sum—the next agreement was on 23rd May also, by which the price of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be paid by me to Messrs. Kelly—that arrangement had been made by Saffery, and that agreement would make a valid and binding contract between the parties—my counsel drew this release of 7th August, 1874 (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>), that is a formal release, and it is executed by Messrs. Kelly and Saffery—the next is a conveyance executed between the College and the Company, and the next is between Messrs. Kelly, Saffery, the College, and the Company, dated 18th November—that deed belongs to the Company, that forms their title deed, any of the directors would see what was the transaction carried out—that was prepared by me—if money was raised upon that, that would appear to the solicitor for the mortgagees—I conveyed lots 1 and 2 separately in February—the word "agreed" is left out of the deed of 30th October by which Saffery conveys lot 1—in</p>

I have no retainer or salary from the Company—I am only paid in the way of costs—I have my own fees—I have attended some board meetings; not most of them; but only when I had notice to attend—no other legal gentleman was consulted—I was their only adviser on all questions connected with law—I took it for granted that Mr. Saffery was to gain more or less by the transaction—if he took exorbitant profits it was my duty to call the attention of the Company to the fact if I knew it—I never asked a ques<lb/>tion of the directors about that, nor did any of them speak to me on the subject—I mean to represent to the jury, that no communication passed between me and my client on the subject—the question of amount had nothing to do with me—I do not advise the Company as to the price they are to pay, and I never thought it necessary to inquire—I did not know, but I have since ascertained that a gentleman named Spence originally introduced the whole affair to Saffery—I think Mr. Swindle hurst mentioned Spence with reference to Shaftesbury Park—I cannot say whether his name was mentioned in relation to Queen's Park—I knew Spence was being sued—a large portion of the Queen's Park property has been built over since its purchase by the Company, as much as 900 houses, they are also occupied very quickly—I think it is a very valuable property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I believe the proceedings were taken by the committee of investigation; the prosecution is by the Treasury; it has nothing to do with the Company—I should call Spence a general agent—I have known him personally—I never asked Saffery what he was getting, and he did not tell me—I first heard that he was obtaining 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when the contract was signed—my attention had been directed to the fact that the cheque was for 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and not for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I left for the Continent on 9th August, and returned home on 1st or 2nd September—when I said that there was no concealment I meant that the amount appeared on the contract with Driver—by my pass-book the cheque for 9,312<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid into my bank on 13th July, 1874; my balance was then 650<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in at the same time—nothing was paid in to swell my balance between the time when the 11,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid in and the 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid out—turning to the other cheques, 3,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. first, and 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. afterwards, it appears that the sum paid out came from the money which was paid in before—as to the deed of 1st August, I received the information embodied in it principally from the document which had been signed—I do not think it was drawn by counsel—both Saffery and the solicitor told me that there was a contract between Kelly and Saffery—the same answer applies to the recital between the Kellys and Saffery.</p>

The Can Hall estate was first brought to my notice on 16th March, 1876—I had previously heard of a correspondence about it—I received a draft contract from Messrs. Cheston, Mr. Saffery's solicitors, on 7th March—the draft would be returned to Messrs. Cheston—I have a copy of it—I also received a letter referring me to Mr. Callington to proceed with the purchase—I saw Swindlehurst about 8th March, and I have no doubt I showed him the contract—the original price is 51,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and no mention is made of a deposit of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the original contract—I received a letter from Messrs.

               <p>Colgrave and Saffery—I think he said he would see his solicitor—I received the abstract from Saffery's solicitors, Messrs.

Callington, the solicitors for the vendors, and they and Mr. Saffery saw me on the 24th—Mr. Saffery did not like the conveyance being taken by the two parties at once—he did not care about his client seeing that the person to whom he sold it had sold it for a larger sum, and suggested that the conveyance should be direct to Saffery, and after discussion the matter was referred to Mr. Burrows, a convincing counsel, and it was arranged that the property should be conveyed direct from the vendor to the Company, and that Mr. Saffery should be a contracting party, and that a mortgage of 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. should be executed—I saw Mr. Saffery again on 27th March, and it was arranged that I should prepare a release of his interest in the property in favour of the Company—Mr. Spence called on me on 3rd April—on the 7th I prepared the release on the chance of our not being able to settle it in any other way, but it was not executed—I saw Mr. Callington on 10th April—I afterwards saw Saffery on the subject, and it was arranged that bills should be given for the instalments instead of cash—I do not know whose arrangement that was—I think I consulted Mr. Swindlehurst—I certainly consulted somebody—I had a special meeting with Swindlehurst to arrange how the conveyance should be carried out—I have an entry on 12th April to the effect that I saw Dr. Langley as to the Can Hall estate,' but I do not remember seeing him—I saw him very frequently, and I have letters to that effect—I believe I did not see him on that subject—the cheque for the completion of the purchase was paid on 12th April—it was my cheque, and made payable to Messrs.

I first heard that Saffery had obtained the agreement of 30th December, 1875, about six weeks before I signed the contract with him, or before 16th March, 1876—I had casually heard of the Can Hall estate twelve months before—I wrote the letter to Swindlehurst of 24th January, 1876—Saffery obtained the contract with Colgrave—the contract was left with me—I have no memo<lb/>randum when I received it—the agreement was deposited with me as security for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said Saffery and Swindlehurst were at arm's length, but I did not know why I considered he wanted the contract lodged as security—I dealt in the first instance with Messrs. Cheston, who acted in the usual way for a person selling—I drew the deed of conveyance from Colgrave—it is dated 24th March, and it was executed on 12th April—the original contract price was 51,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was afterwards reduced to 48,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., being a reduction of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. an acre—I wished the price to appear on the face of the deed—it was left to me—the fact of a premium being paid is recited in the deed—the receipt is put in the usual way—Mr. Callington witnessed it—it was settled by Mr. Burrows—Swindlehurst and Saffery had nothing to do with the arrangement of the deed—the 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that Saffery was to receive was to be paid by acceptances in two sets of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not remember any objection to that being done at that time, but it was said that it would not do the Company any good—when it was proposed that a change should be made from acceptances to cash, a suggestion was made by Swindlehurst that Saffery should make a rebate on account of receiving cash instead of acceptances—Saffery said he would not consent to a rebate unless he had a mortgage, and insisted upon having the whole sum, and he had to be repaid in full—I came into communication with Spence—I do not know who introduced him, or how the money was to be divided—I have tried to obtain some of this land since for myself—I received a letter on 7th of March from Messrs. Callington about it; 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. An acre was asked for it, and it was said that less than 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not be entertained—I got it down eventually to 840<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. an acre for thirty-two acres after a portion had been taken away—I saw the land several times—I was offering for myself and a client—I wanted to make money by it—I wanted to buy and resell—it is a common thing for people to become middlemen—I was prepared to so act if I succeeded in buying it—people sometimes deal with private individuals at cheaper rates than they do with companies.</p>

I am married, and live at 26, Eagle Street—on 3rd October I was working for Mrs. Turner, and heard the prisoner come downstairs—I know him and know his voice—he went to the door several tunes and said "Open the b——door"—he pushed it and went into the room, and we heard him walk across the floor—he stayed in the room a quarter of an hour, and then I heard him go upstairs, and my attention was then called to smoke coming out of the room, and a little girl came and called out, and I took some pails of water and threw over the fire—the bed was all piled up in a heap by the fireplace and blazing—there was a little fire in the grate but very small, not enough to have caused the bed to catch fire—it was a dead fire, merely a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> cinders—the floor was burnt where the bed was, and also part of the fireplace, the wainscoting.</p>

I am a bootmaker, of 24, Red Lion Street—the prisoner is my landlord—on 3rd October he came into my shop a little before 12 o'clock and stopped there some time until he saw Mr. and Mrs. Lintott go out, and then within a minute he went towards the kitchen, and was absent about a quarter of an hour, and came back and eat down in my shop again, but said nothing till some people passing saw smoke coming from the front kitchen, and I said, "It looks as if the house was on fire, Leach"—he said, "It does"—Lintott's little girl then went through, and came back and halloed out, "Oh, Mr. Leach, the house is on tire"—he said nothing, but sat there till the alarm was given, and then I told him to go out, and I locked my shop door and went down to the kitchen and found the door open and a great smoke and a blaze—I could hardly get in for the smoke, and I told the women to fetch some water—thu mattress and bedding were all piled up against the fireplace, level with the mantelpiece—I soused water over it and turned it over—there was a bundle of wood between the mattress and the floor; not the whole bundle, it was opened and it was burning with the mattress—there was a mass of blaze altogether—the floor was burnt and part of the mantel-piece and the wainscoting—after I put the fixe out I came upstairs and saw Leach standing on the threshold, where some people were accusing him of it, and he said "I mean to burn the b——lot out," and with that he went away—he has been in the habit of drinking on and off all the time I have known him, about eight months—I can't say that he was drunk on this day.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 32, Palace Road, Lambeth, and am a pensioned police sergeant—in July I was employed by the prosecuting company, and on the 19th I watched Tilke and saw him leave his employer's shop at about 11am. and go to Earl's Court—he carried a basket in his hand, in which there was a paper parcel—Brooks was acting as collector at the station—I saw Tilke put his basket down near where Brooks was standing—I remained at the door and watched them—neither of them knew me—I saw Tilke go from Brooks to the urinal, and come out in a short time and return to where his basket was—I then passed into the station and asked for a ticket for Gloucester Road—while standing at the ticket office people were intervening between me and the defen<lb/>dants Tilke and Brooks, so that I could not see exactly what passed, but I saw a mutual morion of the arms as though something was passing from one to the other—Tilke left the station—I passed on to the platform to Brooks with my ticket to examine and nip, and went to Gloucester Road and remained there on the platform—by the next train arriving at Gloucester Road Tilke came and gave something, presumably a ticket, to examiner Finch—I followed him to a house in Queen's Gate, and re<lb/>turned after him to Gloucester Road—when nearly opposite the station he took a green ticket from his pocket and looked at it—he then went into the station at Gloucester Road and gave a ticket to Finch, who nipped it and allowed him to go on the platform—he took no ticket at the book<lb/>ing office of either station, I am certain—he came by the following train—I am certain on the return journey he took no ticket at Gloucester Road—I thought the green ticket was a return ticket—I saw one of the edges was rough—I got into the train which he did, which took us back to Earl's Court—I followed him up the steps and saw him give up a ticket and leave the station—on the 20th July I again watched him. when he left his master's shop with his basket as before and went to Earl's Court station—Brooks was again the collector—he again placed his basket on the table and he and Brooks leant over it—I then saw Brooks standing a little way off' him—he had a leathern bag in his hand such as ticket collectors use for putting collected tickets into—he took some out, looked at them, and returned them—Brooks looked up</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220037"/>
               <p>and saw me watching him and put down the bag and went to the head of the stairs—Tilke was then standing at the door—I went by the train and waited at the Gloucester Road station some time and saw him come and go to a house in Queen's Gate—then I gave up watching for that day—on the 24th July I again watched him and saw him leave the same place with the same basket and go to the same station—Prior was on duty at that time—Tilke held his basket under his arm when he got to the station—he went near to Prior, and Prior gave him a ticket or tickets—I was standing at the window of the booking-office some few paces off and saw the tickets pass—to the best of my belief there were two tickets—they might have spoken, but I was too far off to hear what they said—Tilke passed to the platform without going to the booking-office to get a ticket—I followed him down and went in the same train as he did to Gloucester Road, where he appeared to give up a ticket—he passed something to a collector—I followed him to the house in Queen's Gate, but saw him no more that day—on the 26th July I again watched him—Prior was on duty, and Tilke passed direct to the platform without taking a ticket, and at Gloucester Road he gave up what was presumably a ticket which I had never seen him take—I watched him to Queen's Gate and he returned to Gloucester Road—he passed to the Hammersmith platform without going to the booking office—he travelled back to Earl's Court and gave up a ticket—neither going nor returning did he take a ticket—on the 27th July I again we watched him, and exactly the same thing occurred—Prior was collector that day—on the 28th July he was again collector—Tilke arrived at the Earl's Court station—I saw Prior go to his ticket table and remove a newspaper, under which there were two tickets—he removed one and took it to Tilke on the platform without going to the booking office—I went to Gloucester Road with the object of watching Tilke again—he did not get out at Gloucester Road that day, but I believe went on to South Kensington—I watched him return from the direction of Queen's Gate—he went to Gloucester Road, I following him—I don't know whether be showed a ticket at Earl's Court—he made a motion to Prior—at Gloucester Road he showed a ticket to Finch and passed on to the platform without going to the booking office—I watched him back to Earl's Court—I fol<lb/>lowed him from the station to a public-house, where he remained a few minutes, and left—directly he had left Prior arrived and went into the public-house, and after a short time came and looked out of the door as though looking for some one—he then went in and remained.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I watched Tilke I went to the place of business, Mr. Scarlett's—I never lost sight of him—his taking a ticket was the exception—I don't recollect any other occasion than I have given—on that occasion I saw him speaking to Brooks, and then he left the station—I went in the train and he followed by the next—he might have taken a ticket in the interval, and if so it would be necessary for him to take one on his return journey—sometimes there is a good deal of traffic at Earl's Court, and sometimes it is quite clear—he could not have obtained a ticket except on the one occasion without my seeing him—I have seen him carrying meat in the ordinary course of business and deliver it at the house in Queen's Gate.</p>

I came home at 11 o'clock, and she did not get home till 2; the child was very cross, and I could not keep it quiet; she would not get into bed, and this is what it has come to"—he also said that he supposed she had taken a little too much whisky—the girl had nothing on, and was covered with blood, and he only had on a bit of his shirt sleeve—he put his wife's shift on to go to the station—the child was in bed in Mrs. Cooper's room—I found these tongs by the fireplace covered with fresh blood, and on some rags in a wooden chest under the bed this table-knife with blood running from it—the lid had been lifted up and the knife dropped under.</p>

I live at 1, Wilmington Square, Clerk<lb/>enwell—I was called to St. Helena Place, and found the prosecutrix in the front room, crouched on the floor, and covered with blood from head to foot—she Lad a flannel petticoat round her, but not on—I removed her to the next room, and found on the front of her head a contused wound about an inch long, not very deep, and immediately behind that a star-shaped wound, under which was a dent in the bone, that was from a more severe blow—I do not think they were done with the knob at the end of these tongs, but with the centre knob—a blow from this end would make a much broader cut—there was also a small contused wound one third of an inch deep, at the back of her head, which might have been produced by striking against something—there were scratches of a knife on her hands, and on her throat a wound about three inches long, going from right to left, and jagged at one end—it went down to the wind<lb/>pipe and touched the cartilages and muscles, but it did not open the windpipe—it could be done with this knife—it was jagged, showing that the knife had been drawn across two or three times, and had grazed the skin, but the knife need not have been taken from the original wound to do that—it was only serious from the loss of blood—injury to the windpipe might have led to inflammation of the lungs, but the cut would have had to go considerably deeper than it did, to touch any of the main vessels—there was also a cut between her left thumb and forefinger three-quarters of an inch long, and rather deep, and a cor<lb/>responding cut on the finger, as if she had had the knife thus—it was as you would expect to find when one person was wresting a knife from another—there were a great many small cuts on both hands—she went into the hospital the next day as there was no one to nurse her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a French polisher, living at 48, Golden Lane—I was going home about one o'clock on the morning of 14th September, when I saw <hi rend="italic">the</hi> prisoner and another man and woman in Golden Lane—tho prisoner was showing his arm to a police constable—the woman went</p>

               <p>into the police station in Old Street, while the prisoner waited at the bottom—in the hearing of the prisoner, she said to the policeman, "What can I do with that young man, for he won't let me go neither one way nor the other? I would rather you lock me up than I go with hum"—the policeman said, "You go your way, and he will go his"—the prisoner went towards Whitecross Street, and 1 and the woman went down Wilderness Row, which are in different directions—when we got down Wilderness Bow some distance, I saw the prisoner, who ran across the road to us—we tried to avoid him, but he caught us up—he ran in front of the woman, and made a blow at her, saying, "Liz, I have done for you now, I will do my <hi rend="italic">drag</hi> for you"—the woman screamed, "Oh!" and I caught hold of her to assist her—the prisoner said, "I'd as lieve stick a knife into you as look at you"—I tried to assist her across the road, but she fell back in the middle of the road, and I was obliged to let go—a policeman came up, and she was conveyed to the station—I saw the prisoner with the policeman, and heard him say, "I'll hang for her"—he gave the policeman a knife, and said, "I have dune it; I will swing for her!"—as far as I saw, the woman gave him no pro<lb/>vocation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am surgeon to the G division of police—on the morning of 13th September, about one, I was called to the Old Street station, and found a woman lying on one of the benches in a state of unconsciousness from which she never recovered—she died in about ten minutes—the front of her clothing was saturated with blood—there was a punctured wound about five-eighths of an inch in length over the left breast, from which the blood was flowing—at that time I was only able to trace it about an inch downwards, but I afterwards made <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination—the knife (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) corresponds with the wound—it had penetrated the bony substance of the third rib, and gone into the left ventricle of the heart—considerable violence must have been used—she died from the effects of that wound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was extensive adhesion of the left lung, the result of which was to throw the heart considerably forward on the wall of the chest—with the heart in that abnormal condition it would require a wound of lesser depth and force to penetrate it than under ordinary circumstances—the wound went into the cavity of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Considerable violence must have been used, because the knife penetrated the bone—as a rule, when the rib is struck it yields, or breaks, or the substance is struck off, but in this case it</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220042"/>
               <p>went directly through the bone—had the heart not been displaced the wound would have penetrated the lung—that would not necessarily have been fatal.</p>

                  </hi>. I am nineteen years old, and am now in St. Bartholomew's Hospital—in January this year I left my situation, and went to live with the prisoner—he is a hairdresser's assistant—we lived at 27, Cowper Street, Islington, in July, and I had charge of Mrs. Barth's baby, who lodged in the same house, while she was out all day at her business—the baby was subject to convulsion fits—on 25th July Mrs. Barth wanted me to go and have the baby's likeness taken—I did not tell the prisoner where I was going, but I asked him whether I could go out—I gave him the key in case I did not get back in time—my sister went with me, and on our way home I called where the prisoner was employed, and got the key from him—I went home and prepared tea, and he came home about. six o'clock, and said that I had been rather too long—I said that I had not been longer than I could help, and showed him the baby's photograph—he said that I had no business to have it taken, wasting my money—I said that my sister paid for it—she was not present—we began tea, and in the middle of it he asked to see the picture again, and he deliberately broke it on the corner of a chair, and threw it on the fire, and smacked me in the face once or twice—I think I flew at him, it was in self-defence if I did, and he struck me again in the chest with his fist, I believe—until he smacked my face I had done nothing to provoke him that I am aware of—on the morning of the 26th he went to his work, and came home to breakfast about 10 o'clock, having shaved off his moustache and whiskers—I said "What have you done that for? what a boy you look"—he said "I have had a clean shave to "swing for you in"—I said "I am glad you let me know"—we breakfasted in Mrs. Barth's room that morning because the baby was so ill, but Mrs. Barth was not present, she had gone to her work—as we were sitting down to breakfast the prisoner said to me "If you have got anything to say you had better say it, as you have not much longer to live; you may live another half hour, and you may live till to-morrow"—I said "You have threatened me so often, I take no notice of your threats"—he never said anything for ever so long, and then he got up off his chair and threw himself across the hearthrug—I asked him to get up, but he made no reply—I went downstairs, and came up again, and he was still on the hearthrug—I said "Mr. Pick<lb/>ford," that is his employer, "has sent for you, and wants to know if you are going back to your work"—he said that he was never going to do any</p>

               <p>more work, and I need not trouble myself—I then asked him to go into our own room, but he made no answer, still lying on the hearthrug—I washed the baby, and it had two fits—I then put the tea things away and went into our own room, and then downstairs and saw Mrs. Oliver the landlady—I then went up to Mrs. Barth's room, and the prisoner—was sitting on a chair—I said "Mrs. Oliver is coming to ask you for the rent" and Mrs. Oliver walked in behind me. and asked him for the rent—this was about 11 o'clock—he said "I will give you a fortnight next Monday"—she said "Very well," and left the room—I asked him why he did not give Mrs. Oliver the rent—he said "Before I give her the rent her house will be in the <hi rend="italic">Police News"</hi>—he did not take in the <hi rend="italic">Police News</hi>, but I think they sold it, or had it at the shop—I said "We should make two nice pictures for the <hi rend="italic">Police News"</hi>—a short time after that I asked him for a penny to get half a pint of beer—he said that I need not trouble myself, I should not want any more pennies for beer out of him—I went and got half a pint of beer with a penny of my own, and brought it back—he drank a very little of it, and I finished it—when he was drinking it he said "My love to you, and I hope you will be better tempered the next time we have a drop more together"—I said "I have no doubt we shall," or something to that effect—I then noticed that the child was in a fit, and went across to it, and as I did so I said to the prisoner "You had better go out for a walk, or else I will"—he said "Next time you go out it will be in a cab to the hospital"—I cannot remember what I said, and I think he went into his own room—I took the child downstairs, and brought it up again, and laid it down—the prisoner was then there, and I said "I wish you would keep in your own room"—I do not think he made any answer—I was sitting at the side of the bed looking at the baby, who was in a fit, and the prisoner shut the door and the window, and came towards me—I said "Bill, look at this child"—he made no more to do, but hit me on the back of my head deliberately with a chopper, which I first saw when it was lifted in his hand to strike—it was Mrs. Barth's chopper, and had been in a corner of that room—I said "Bill, before you hit me again think what you are doing it for, and what excuse you will make"—he said "I will soon find some excuse"—he kept on repeating the blows, and I fell off the side of the bed, and saw him change the chopper into his left hand—I said "Bill, if you hit me once more you will kill me"—he said "That is what I want to do"—how I got up I do not know, but I got to the door—I kept continually screaming, I think, till I lost my senses—just as I got to the top of the steps a person who lives next door came to my assistance—I saw her on the stairs.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Directly I went to live with him he proposed to marry me, and I think he commenced to save up money for that purpose, and I believe he gave it to his master to keep for him—after which he fell ill, and was for some time in the doctor's hands, and for the time the marriage was spoken of no more—when he broke the likeness and I flew at him I do not think he was smoking a pipe—I do not remember smashing a pipe in his mouth—he usually smoked after tea, but that was in the middle of tea—I flew at him quite in self-defence—I did not kick him—I never used my foot in my life that I can remember to him—I once tried to bite him when he had his hand across my throat; not this time, some time ago—I may have endeavoured to dash the pipe from his mouth—when I</p>

               <p>asked him for a penny for beer I did not stamp my foot in front of him, I did not feel so inclined—I never in my life spat in his face—I did not dare him to touch me—I do not remember snatching a pan from the table—there was no pan but one, which I left in my own room on the drawers, clean and quite empty—I did not pass it towards him as if I was <hi rend="italic">going</hi> to throw it at him—I washed the baby in Mrs. Barth's room, but I never attempted to throw the pan, that was before the blows were given—I only moved the pan from one chair to another, and he laid on the floor nearly all that time—he struck me with the proper side of the chopper which they chop wood with, but it is not very sharp—the prisoner was sitting near the cupboard where Mrs. Barth keeps her wood, and in which the chopper was kept.</p>

                  </hi>. I am superintendent of the Dock Company's Police—on 28th September I received information and sent for Sinclair and Bird, and saw them separately—I said to-Sinclair "I learn you were at our warehouse last night," and told him it was a serious matter, and cautioned him—he said "It was arranged with foreman Ryan about a month ago that I, Bird, and another man by the name of Carr should be in the warehouse and make up some bales of wool; I and Carr remained in one night, about the 13th, and made up two bales: on the following night we stopped in again and made up two more, making in all four bales, which on the following day were put into the scale; Ryan told us to mark them A. M. and a diamond No. I to 4, which was done"—Sinclair then said he had received about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for that transaction, and afterwards received a few shillings at the time, about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—he said "Nothing more transpired until the previous day, when Ryan came to Sinclair and said 'You had better stop in again to-night with Bird and Carr and make up four bales more, get them marked A. M. diamond No. 5 to 8,' which we did; the bags were brought to the scale and there they remain ready to be—weighed"—I asked Bird what he had to say, and he said he knew nothing about the wool whatever; that he was working in the wool warehouse on the previous day, and that having left his jacket in the foreman's box he went there to get it, and on his return he found the door locked, and rather than make any bother in reference to his being locked in, he remained there all night; but he admitted having seen Sinclair there about five o'clock in the morning—I afterwards brought them to<lb/>gether, and read each other's statements so that they knew what each had said—I then sent for Ryan, and told him what Sinclair had said—Ryan said "It is no good denying facts, it is true; I have done it to make too ends meet"—I said "It is a very serious matter, and whatever you</p>

               <p>have to say may be made use of as evidence"—he said "I cannot help it; I may as well say it, and make a clean breast of it"—he said a person of the name of Hammond, about two months ago, asked him to get some bales of wool, and about the 13th September he prepared four bales, got them to the sale, passed them through the sale, and received 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. as the produce, which he divided between himself, Sinclair, Bird, and Carr—I showed Evan the order (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) A. M. I to 4, and asked him if he knew anything about it—he said "Yes, I received it from Mr. Hammond and have acted upon it"—he then said he saw Mr. Hammond on the 27th, and arranged to get four bales more—the four bales were marked "A. M. diamond 5 to 8," and they were placed ready for the scale, where I afterwards found them—I then called Bird in the presence of Ryan, and told him that Ryan had said it was arranged for him to re<lb/>main in with other men, and Ryan said "No good to be downhearted; tell the truth"—Bird said "Well, it is no good to deny it; I did remain in for one night, about the 13th, and we made up two or three bales then: I remained in last night and we made up four bales more, and we marked them A. M. and a diamond; I do not know whether they went to the scales"—the prisoners had no right to make up those bales, and no right to be in the warehouse at all.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective C Division</hi>). About twenty minutes to one a.m. on 9th October I was in Jermyn Street—when I got about the second house past Wood's Hotel, which is No. 102, I saw the two prisoners and another man not in custody standing all three together—I went down York Street, and returned in four or five minutes, when I saw they had all shifted—Poulton was against the railings by himself, perhaps thirty-five yards from Wood's Hotel—I watched him for ten minutes, when Cain, another detective officer, came up—Poulton stood facing us on the opposite side, and gave a shrill whistle, loud enough for any one to hear fifty yards off—almost immediately after two men jumped over the rails from Wood's Hotel—Wilcox was one, and the other I have never seen since—there was an area on the other. side of the railings ten or eleven feet deep—Wilcox and the other man walked quietly along Jermya Street, turned up Eagle Place, and when they turned the corner Cain and I ran after them—we lost sight of them—we went into Piccadilly, and could not see them anywhere—Poulton then passed</p>

               <p>us into Piccadilly, and we turned and followed him—he turned round Great Windmill Street, and after that we took him into custody—it was perhaps five minutes from the time they left the area railings that we apprehended Poulton—I told him he would be charged with, two others for coming out of Wood's Hotel, Jermyn Street—he said he knew nothing about it—I took him to the station—I then went back to Jermyn Street, and saw Wilcox standing against a post in York Street, about thirty-five yards from Wood's Hotel—I am quite satisfied that the prisoner is the man I previously saw get over the railings—he had a peculiar scarf on, and I noticed him particularly—I asked Wilcox what he was waiting there for—he said he was waiting for a friend—I said "Your friend is at the station in Vine Street"—I then took him to the station, and told him what he would be charged with—I then re<lb/>turned to Wood's Hotel and examined the premises—I rang the bell, and the housekeeper came down, and we went into the area—she un<lb/>done the inside door with a key and bolts—the chain had been undone—and I then saw the outer door standing open about four inches—a glass had been broken, through which anybody could get at the chain from outside—there was a pair of wooden steps in the area, made on purpose for the area steps—I ascertained they had been laid down in the area, but they were then in their usual place leading up out of the area, so that anybody getting over the railings could slide down, and then put the steps against the wall and get up—I examined the area, and could see somebody had been over the rails and slid down.</p>

Poulton gave me his address, and I went to it and found it right—<hi rend="italic">I</hi> made inquiries about him—he would not tell me where he worked—the other did—I saw Poulton's mother—she said she did not know where he worked at the present time—I do not know that he worked at the Horse Shoe Hotel as copper<lb/>man under the cook—it was about forty yards from Jermyn Street, along Piccadilly, that I met Poulton—he whistled; not a tune, I am quite sure—it was not one of the other men that whistled—I thought it was to give the other men notice—when I went down York Street and came back Poulton was standing alone—he had passed me so close that I could not fail to recog<lb/>nise him as the one I had seen in Jermyn Street—he did not run away—Poulton's mother told me before I asked her that he did not leave there till something after 12 o'clock, and thought he had been drinking—she might have said that he had been out and came in after 12 o'clock—she did not say she had blowed him up for coming in late, and that was why he went out again, but that he had been there after 12, been drinking, and gone out again.</p>

The prisoners denied all knowledge of each other when brought together—Wilcox gave me a correct address, and the name of his employer, which was also correct—I did not mention about a scarf before the police magistrate—it was a worsted scarf, with two or three colours in it, blue and white, I think, and violet, and the same pin in it as he is wearing now—there was a street-lamp standing close to where we were—the houses are mostly shops there—there were two private houses where Wood's Hotel is and then a box manufacturer's, and then a newspaper shop—I should say I was twenty-five or thirty yards off when Wilcox came over the area railings—the lamp I refer to is attached to the next house to Wood's Hotel, and is, I should say, four</p>

               <p>or five yards from where the men leaped over—Regent Street would be crowded at that time of the morning, and the Haymarket, no doubt—they were a long way from the Haymarket—I said before the magistrate we vent after them—I did not see them run—I have never made a mis<lb/>take as to identity—I never had a case in which a man named Bell was charged with sheep-stealing—I made some inquiry as to Wilcox's family—he was not living with his family, but with people he has lived with since he was a boy—they were very respectable—Poulton's address was Edward Street, Wardour Street, Oxford Street—on the very night of this affair I went up to the address of Wilcox—I found no sign of any house-breaking implements either in the house or on his person.</p>

I live at Lugar, in Ayrshire, and am a surgeon in practice there—on the 16th August I came up to London for a holiday, and on the 24th I went down to Croydon to see the races—when I went on the course Grant, turning to me, asked if I knew the names of the horses walking about—I told him I did not, and immediately after<lb/>wards I turned to go away—he came after me and said "I think you are a Scotchman; I am a Scotchman too"—he said "I am here just now for holidays"—he asked me first if I was, and I said "Yes"—he told me his name was Grant—that he belonged to Paisley, his father was a shawl manufacturer there, and that he had a brother in the firm—soon after Draper came up, and Grant turned to me and said "Here is a friend of mine coming who does some betting for me," and he told me he was brother to the great jockey, Cannon—he introduced him to me as "Cannon," and they spoke aside to each other for a minute or two—he turned to go away, and when he had gone eight or ten yards, Grant came after mo and said to him, "You might see what you can do for my friend here"—he turned round and held up his hand and said "All right"—I went on—I turned round to Grant and said "I didn't come here to bet; I am not going to bet at all, I know nothing about it"—a short time afterwards Draper came back, put a ticket for a bet made in the hand of Grant, and handed one to me—I said I didn't authorise him to make any bets for me and refused to take the ticket at first—Draper said "Oh, I understood I was to make a bet for you"—I objected again, and Grant said "Oh, <hi rend="italic">it is</hi> all right"—Draper said, when I objected to pay the money, "Oh, but I have paid the money for you"—I think it was 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that having been represented to me, although I had not authorised him to do so, I gave him the money—Draper then went away—I thought I was in duty bound to pay the money—I took them to be gentlemen—Draper came back—I think it was after a race was run—he said there had been a bet on, and that I had won 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I thought he was going to hand me the money, but he said "I have made another <hi rend="italic">bet for</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I objected again, and Grant said "It is all right"—I was asked for more money—I had only a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note in my pocket at the time, and I was induced to give it him—Draper said I was owing him something for what he had paid for me, I cannot tell how much—the next time he came running back after the next race, and said "Oh, I have lost you 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," but before the race finished he had made another bet for me, whereby I had won 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had risked 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but won 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I am not going to have any more of this"—I told him I wished to get away—when they saw I was anxious to get away one of them said he would go and see if he could find the bookmaker, and let him come out and see if he could make arrangements for me to go away—he repre<lb/>sented that I had won some money—Draper went over to where the crowd was, and came back and said "The bookmaker will be here after the next race to see you"—he went away again and left Grant and myself together, and came back and said that he had backed a horse for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me—I think I got a ticket twice—it seemed just like a visiting card, with a man's name on it—I objected again to the man betting on</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220059"/>
               <p>my account—Grant said "Oh, it is all right, you have won more money than you can possibly lose"—the bookmaker was a man rather under the medium height, well built—he came out shortly after the race was run in which they said they had lost 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me—I had one of the racing cards in my hand, and Grant told me to give him my card, and asked for the loan of my pencil, and reckoned up on my card the amount they said they had lost for me, and the amount they said I had won—they said they had lost altogether 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., exclusive of the 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had given them, and they had won for me 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "That being so, you should hand to me 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—they were all speaking together—they said that the money I had lost would have to be paid before the money won would be given—I said it was a very strange proceeding; I was going away, and must make some arrangement, and the bookmaker made arrangements with the two others to meet at the Cannon Street Hotel at, I think, about 7 or 7.30 o'clock—they said they would go with me, which they did, and we went out of the racecourse on to Norwood Junction to Victoria, from Victoria to Kennington Park, and then they stopped at a public-house there till I went to my lodgings—I got my pocket-book, and found I had 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in it in notes and gold—I went back to the public-house, and found them standing outside—the cab was kept—we drove from there to a place where Grant said he stayed, some hotel in Aldersgate—he got out, and said he would be away for a few minutes; he would go to his hotel for Mb money—he was away about two minutes or so, and when he came back he had in his hand what looked like a bank-note—I did not see the face <hi rend="italic">of it; it</hi> was folded up, and what appeared to be some sovereigns on the top—he said he was sorry, he found he had not so much money as he thought; that he would not be able to pay all the money he had lost, but he gave it to Cannon, saying to him "I will <hi rend="italic">give you my</hi> money, and you can arrange with, the bookmaker; "and turning to me he said "You had better give him your money also," and I handed the 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to him—we were driving to Cannon Street—I might mention that on getting into the cab before that Cannon began speaking to me about his kinship—he told me he knew very little about London; that he was only in London occasionally—we then drove near to Cannon Street Hotel—we had to go down some street to get to it—I went with the prisoner and Draper into the station, on the platform, where we found the young man represented to be the bookmaker—Cannon and he went apart and spoke to one another, and Grant remained with me—after they had spoken aside for a time, they came and said to me ""We will go round to the private bar and we will arrange the matter there"—the bookmaker and Draper went first—Grant kept beside me, and we followed a few yards behind—when we got in, Draper and the bookmaker went to the far side of the private bar and had some conversation there; and Grant remained the other side speaking to me—after they had spoken for a minute or so, they came across, and the bookmaker addressing me said he was sorry that all the money was not forthcoming, but that Mr. Cannon (Draper) had promised <hi rend="italic">to get</hi> the rest of the money by the morning, and if we all met at 9 o'clock the next morning at the same place they would pay the money that was alleged to have been won—the bookmaker imme<lb/>diately went out, and I, turning to the other two, said "Well, I have not got any money"—Grant asked Draper if he could not give me some—he said he had got some silver, and he took some silver out of his</p>

               <p>pocket and held it out in his hand—I said I had nothing to take me home, so I took a florin—that was outside the station—about two minutes afterwards we left the place, and I went one way and they went another—before separating, however, Draper said to me "We had better be here at a quarter to nine in the morning"—I got there at half-past eight the next morning, and stayed till half-past nine—I never saw any of them—I then called at all the hotels in Aldersgate, and gave information to the police—on the afternoon of the 27th August I was walking down the Strand, near Charing Cross Railway station, when I met Grant and Draper with a stranger—when Draper saw me he turned round as if to move away, and I went up and said to him "What have you done with my money?"—"Oh," he said, "you have not kept your appointment"—"Oh yes," I said, I had, but they had not—"Oh," they said, "all right, no fear of that"—I said it was not all right, and that I believed they were a couple of swindlers—then they got indignant, and said they had no time to wait, and Draper began to run, and Grant was going to likewise—I collared him, and called for a policeman who was on the opposite side of the way, and gave him into custody—Draper had walked off quickly—I pointed him out to the policeman, and said "I give that man in charge too"—he told me to go after him, as he saw a policeman a little farther on—I went after him, and saw him go into the post-office—I went in, he turned to go out; I followed him out, and at the door I gave him in charge—they were both taken to the station—I have not seen any of my money since.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think I had not been on the race-course more than a quarter of an hour when I met Grant—I could not say whether he was alone or not at first—there were a number of people standing about looking on—he was not in company with any one; he was alone—I told him I did not know anything about betting—I was fond of seeing races—I think I have been to the races twice during the last twelve years—I did not hear Cannon come up and advise Grant to back a horse called "Wild Suffolk Lad"—I was cross-examined at the Mansion House—I swear I never heard the name of "Suffolk Lad"—Grant gave Cannon some money in my presence, shortly after Cannon came up to him—he went away with that before anything was said about my betting—Grant called out to Cannon and said "You had better do something for my friend here"—I did not give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that race to back some horse—I swear I did not bet on any races at all—I gave money twice—there were only three races run all the time I was there—we went before the last race—I cannot tell you whether Cat's-eye ran in that race—I gave 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the first race—Cannon was introduced to me as "Mr. Cannon" when he came up first of all to speak to Grant—the first introdution about the betting was Grant saying to Cannon "You had better put something on for my friend"—I did not give him money to back any horses whatever—I gave him money because he came to me representing that the money had been paid away by him on my account, through a misunderstanding between him and Grant—I thought, although I had not commissioned him to do anything, it would be very dishonourable for me to let the man lose the money on my account—I said "I have not <hi rend="italic">come</hi> down to the course for the purpose of betting"—Cannon handed a ticket to me—he took it back—he did not go and make another bet on the same race, or on a <hi rend="italic">place</hi> bet he did not give me a second ticket on the first race and say he had laid 3</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220063"/>
               <p>to 2 for the first and second place both for Grant and me—he gave me a second ticket about a second race, I cannot say whether to win or for a place—the bets were not written down by the bookmaker with my pencil at the Cannon Street Hotel, and I do not recollect that they were written down by him at all—I recollect a horse of the name of Lost Sheep—I do not recollect a horse named Meredith—I did not ask Grant whether he was sure Cannon would come back with the money for the first race—Cannon did not come back after the first race and say "I drew your money and laid it out on another horse called Meredith with 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more"—he said he had made another bet, but I couldn't say on what horse—I am not aware that he said he had taken 50 to 10 to win, and 10 to 3 for a place with regard to that horse—he told me had backed another horse for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is all I remember—I think he mentioned about 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I should have to give him—I cannot say the exact amount—I did not say I had only two sovereigns left—I swear that I had a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note left after I gave him the first 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had 27<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at home and my lodgings—I did not tell Cannon that if he trusted me with 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I had money at home and it—would be all right—I was told the horse lost the race on which the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was put on for me—I didn't know anything about it—I was told I had 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on Lost Sheep—I had no ticket given me for it—Grant did not put it down on the race card at that time—it was put down, but I could not understand how much I had lost and won—I was told that the race was lost by Lost Sheep—I said I was a "lost sheep" when I was leaving the course—I was told I had won 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at one time—I did not say that I objected to winning 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had shrewd suspicions at the time that I had been swindled—I had repudiated the bets all along—I did not repudiate tie bet when I was told I had won 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—we all left—Grant left the cab and went away for the purpose of getting some money—the bookmaker was not with us in the cab—Grant came back and said he had not sufficient money, but I cannot remember the amount he said—he did not say he was willing to hand over his 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Cannon—I swear that" he handed over some money, but I cannot say how much—he had what appeared to be paper money—I believe he said something to Cannon about it being all he had got, and that he would make it up the nest morning—I recollect the next morning was the 25th August—I recollect the bookmaker said at the Cannon Street Hotel that he should be there in the morning, but at all events he should be on the race<lb/>course—a part of the next morning was wet—it was raining in the morning when I went to Cannon Street Hotel; not pouring in torrents—it was not a day I should enjoy being on Croydon race-course—I went to Croydon to see if Grant or Cannon were there—I said that at the police-court—Cannon said when I met him that I had not kept my appointment—he did not say I ought—to have waited till ten—I left Charing Cross for the race-course on the 25th by about one o'clock.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On the 11th inst. I went, in company with constables Osborne and Maroni and Mr. Coulden, the prosecutor, to Shenstone's shop, 83, Goswell Road—I went in alone—I should call it an ordinary manufacturing fur-shop—I saw Mrs. Shen<lb/>stone there, and afterwards the others came in—I said to Cain, in the presence of Shenstone, "Is this the person to whom you" sold the skins?"—he said "Yes"—I then said to Shenstone "Have you bought any skins of this lad?"—she said "Yes"—I said "How many?"—she said "It might be two or three dozen"—I said "How much did you give for them?"—she said "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each"—she pointed to a shelf in the shop, and a person in the shop fetched down a large quantity of prepared skins, some of these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she and her son sorted out three dozen—she said "There they are; I don't know whether they are all Mr. Coulden's"—I then said "Do you know this lad?" (<hi rend="italic">pointing to Cain</hi>)—she said "No"—I afterwards said "Don't you know what he is?"—she said "No; a furrier, I thought," or "I think," I won't be sure which—I said "Have you bought any more?"—she said "No"—I said "I want <hi rend="italic">two</hi> dozen and nine more"—she said "I have not bought any more"—I said "We are going to take these away (<hi rend="italic">Referring to the three dozen skins</hi>), and you will be charged with receiving them knowing them to be stolen"—she said "Oh, the vaga<lb/>bond! I wish I had never seen them"—she said to Mr. Coulden "How many are there, how much are they?"—he said "I cannot have any<lb/>thing to do with it"—she then went to the back of the shop with the other officer, Osborne—I afterwards searched the shop, and brought away another ten dozen skins similar to these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I should think Shenstone went to the back of the shop with Osborne to put her shawl and bonnet on, and to see that she did not run away—they were out of my sight—I have no idea whether they were alone together—it was she who mentioned Mr. Coulden's name—I had not mentioned it, I am quite sure—Mr. Coulden was in the shop all the time.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). About three o'clock on the 11th October I went with detectives Maroni and Westwood to the warehouse of Messrs. Coulden and Son, 44, Gresham Street, where we saw the prisoner France—I took him into custody, and he was conveyed with Cain to the police station—from information we received from France and Cain, Westwood, Maroni, and myself went to Shenstone's shop in the Goswell Road on the same day, the 11th—she expressed a wish to go to the back yard, and I went with her—she went for a certain pur<lb/>pose, and then washed her hands—she said "I am sorry I bought them, bat you know what it is when things like that are offered by a boy; it is a great temptation, and you want to get them as cheap as you can, I suppose it is only a leaden penalty," which expression was accompanied by her putting her hand under her apron and rattling something like money—at that time one of the G Division Metro<lb/>politan Police came into the shop—we had sent for him—we generally make it a practice of doing so—Shenstone said "What does that police<lb/>man want"—I said "You have denied buying any more skins—I believe you have two dozen and nine more, and we are going to search the place for them"—her son then came to her, and she pointed to a shelf and said "You will find them there"—and there was a number produced from the shelf—Mrs. Shenstone and her son selected two dozen and nine—she said she thought they were them, and pointed to the lad Cain, and said she gave a shilling each for them, the same as she did for the others—she was then taken to the station and the charge read over to her—she said "I admit buying the five dozen and nine of the boy, but those are mine," pointing to a bundle of ten dozen.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> That bundle is here—what I have related was her own statement without any questions from me—there was a remand in the case—I was examined on the first occasion, and gave part of my evidence, not the whole, because it was taken by the Court to affect each prisoner—I gave evidence, and Mr. Vesey informed the Court that he should have to recall me—I gave evidence against Mrs. Shenstone on the second occasion—she was in the dock on the first occasion, and my giving evidence against her was, with Mr. Wontner's concurrence, left till the next remand—I do not mean that I suppressed or kept back evidence with Mr. Wontner's concurrence—I did not say on the first occasion anything about Shenstone going into the back premises, but I was prepared to say it—it was a very busy day at Guildhall—Mr. Pratt opened the case, and I gave evidence, and left the box without saying a word about this supposed conversation—I said I had other evidence to give personally—I spoke of the appre<lb/>hension of Cain, and what he said in answer to the charge; and I was then about to commence about Mrs. Shenstone, when Mr. Pratt said to Mr. Martin there was evidence, but proposed to take the next fitness, and Mr. Martin, the Chief Clerk, concurred—she was taken into custody by Westwood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> The first evidence I gave was only in reference to Cain and France—the other two officers, Westwood and Maroni, gave their evidence upon the first occasion—Mr. Pratt was the solicitor for the prosecution at that time—he said in open Court before the Alderman that Osborne would give further evidence with respect to Mrs. Shenstone, and</p>

               <p>the Chief Clerk consulted with the Alderman, and they thought there was sufficient evidence for a remand.</p>

On Saturday morning, 22nd Sep<lb/>tember, I was in Dean Street, and saw the prisoner come out of St. Ann's Church, close the door after him, and walk away—I followed him and he ran—I ran after him—he got twenty yards in advance of me—I sprang my rattle, and another constable came towards me—before I got up to the prisoner he threw away this piece of steel (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I took him in custody, and at the station he tried to throw away this other piece of steel—both pieces have some sticky substance still attached to them—he said that he picked the steel up on the church steps—I found on him six florins, six shillings, a sixpence, and two halfpence—they have a sticky substance on them, and have evidently been wiped with this duster, which I found on him.</p>

                  </hi>. I was tried at the last April Sessions of this Court for forgery, and convicted—I made the acquaintance of the prisoner Meiklejohn in Nov., 1872, at the Angel Hotel, Islington—I knew he was a detective—I was a racing man—Murray was then with me—he was a racing man—Meiklejohn said "What are you, I don't take you for a flat, what are you?"—I said "I am a bookmaker"—he said "Where do you make a book?"—I said "In Scotland and in the north of Ireland"—he said "Have you seen that notice in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> to-day?"—I said "Yes"—he said to Murray "I will bet a fiver that that notice is not right," meaning "is not correct"—I nodded to Murray to induce him to bet—he asked me if I knew Dumblane, I said yes—he said "My home is there"—I said</p>

               <p>What have you come up here for?"—he said "I have come to get some Swedish bonds back that some people at the confidence game have got"—he said that he had to go and see a man named Charley Scanes to get some information about it from him—I said "Will Charley Scanes give you any information about it?"—Meiklejohn said "If he does not I will give him a drag"—that means three months' imprisonment—he left me then and I followed him—in half an hour he returned and told me he knew a man named Davis who was the manager to Peddie, the adver<lb/>tising list man—he said he could get the list of all Peddie's clients, and that he would see me about it to-morrow and have Davis there—he asked me how he should communicate with me—I told him to write to Murray—he said he would—on the following day Meiklejohn introduced me to Davis and said "Davis will make a good manager to your firm"—I said I was not satisfied with Davis—after leaving Davis Meiklejohn said "I should like to serve that man Peddie out, he is a man that has deserted his wife and family, why don't you start in his name? I was the first man to discover that the Betting Act did not extend to Scotland"—I said "I thought I was the first man to discover that"—he said "How is that?"—I said "I sent a person down to Glasgow to take counsel's opinion about it, and to insert an advertisement about it in the <hi rend="italic">Sports<lb/>man</hi> "—he said "Oh, you understand advertisements"—I said "Oh yes"—he said "Why don't you start in London?"—I said "If I started in London the Treasury would prosecute me"—he said "I can tell you how you can avoid that"—I said "How"—he said "Open two offices, one in the City and one in our district; if the warrant is issued in the City they cannot execute it in our district"—I said "That would only apply to a warrant issued to arrest persons on the premises"—he said "Oh no, any warrant, they cannot execute it in our district"—I said "Give me one of your cards, will you?"—he said "Do not make any bad use of it"—I said "What do you mean?"—I cannot tell you what has become of that card, it is five years ago—it had on it "Mr. Sergeant Meikle<lb/>john, Scotland Yard," or "J. Meiklejohn, Sergeant of Police, Scotland Yard"—something to that effect—he was then a sergeant in the police—I established a betting agency in Edinburgh in the name of Philip Gard<lb/>ner and Co. from February till April or May, 1873—two of my interviews with Meiklejohn took place at the Angel and one at Temple Bar, when he gave me the card, but we went to a public-house to see Davis—I saw Meiklejohn again at the Nag's Head, Holloway—he produced a printed police bill from his pocket and said "Do you know anything of these people; you have been making a book in Scotland, I should think you. ought to know some of these men"—I said I did not, but if he gave me the bill I would inquire—the bill referred to myself as Philip Gardner and Co.—about a fortnight after that I went to America and stayed six months, partly in consequence of seeing that bill, and partly to start a' betting agency in New York—a day or two after arriving in London on my return Meiklejohn sent a man named Burke to me, and in conse<lb/>quence of a communication from Burke I went to 1, Mile Street, South. Lambeth, where I found Meiklejohn was living—Meiklejohn said "I can settle that affair for you in Scotland, and I suppose Burke has told you that I shall want 100 quid," meaning 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "If you can settle it I will give you 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and an appointment was made for the next day, when I handed Burke 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a public-house near Meiklejohn's house—</p>

               <p>I was not present when the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to Meiklejohn—I cannot say whether I heard from Meiklejohn that he had received it, but the arrange<lb/>ment was made that I was to give him 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "How am I to know that this thing is stopped?"—Meiklejohn said "I will write down to the police at Edinburgh and show you their letter"—that conversation took place within five minutes of my handing the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Burke—I asked Meiklejohn, "How am I to know that this thing is stopped?"—he said "I will write down to the police at Edinburgh and show you their reply"—that was the same night after the money had been paid—I knew a warrant was out against me, and the subject was mentioned in the con<lb/>versation—Meiklejohn said "They were nearly collaring you at Tippe-rary; they telegraphed over to Ireland, believing that you were there"—I had been in Ireland after leaving Edinburgh, in consequence of the warrants I supposed were out against me—after this conversation with Meiklejohn I did not keep in hiding, but walked about as usual—I never was arrested in consequence of the Edinburgh transaction—I next saw Meiklejohn in November, 1873, within about a month of the conversation I have last mentioned—I saw him at his own house in Mile Street—I have seen him at several places; at the Silver Cross, for instance—I saw him three or four times from November to the end of the year—when I wanted to communicate with him I went to Scotland Yard; but it was subsequently arranged that I should go to the Silver Cross, and send the potman there with a note to Meiklejohn—in the month of June, 1874, I paid Meiklejohn 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in all; 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent by post, and the other I took to him—the first 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was sent on the 13th. and the other I gave him on the 17th—that was for giving me information while I was in Glasgow, where I had opened a spurious betting agency in the name of Adamson—it was called "The Discretionary Investment Society"—Meiklejohn was to let me know when they received any complaints at Scotland Yard—that society lasted about three months—I established another betting agency in London in the name of Archer and Co., in Adam Street, Strand—that was on 31st July, 1874—that lasted about four days—it came to an end 'because one of the clerks was arrested by Druscovich and taken to Scotland Yard; that was a man named Harry Street—the firm con<lb/>sisted of Street, myself, and Benson—after that the firm was carried on at Glasgow—I was sent to Brighton for about three days—the same firm Archer and Co. was carried on there, only it was called the Paris Discretionary, translated into French—in Nov. I paid Meiklejohn 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—in speaking of these dates I am speaking from memory this is a letter that I received from Meiklejohn—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Nov. 16, 1874.

I was to wire to him to fix an appointment—there was no arrangement between us to telegraph to each other—this is also a letter from Meiklejohn. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Nov. 17th, 1874, Dear Bill,—Rather important news from the North. Tell H.

I should like to see you as early as possible, and bring this note with you under any circumstances. I fancy the brief is out for some of you. If not, it will be. So you must keep a sharp look out.")

I should like you to see him first, and then I could keep him up to the mark. If you cannot see him to-morrow leave word for me at S. X. and I will write him and make an appointment. Why not go to the Vic Theatre to-night, and you will be sure to find him?" This is also Meiklejohn's—it is addressed William Kurr, Esq., Thursday evening, 19th Nov., 1874. "Dear Bill,—I have written to H. H. W. to meet me at the Silver Cross to-morrow at three p.m., and that I should wait for him 30 minutes. You and Bill had better see me at the Red Lion, Parliament Street, at 2.30, before seeing him, then matters can be arranged as to meeting. Should he not come then I can tell you when you can see him at his own private residence, but he is sure to come." I can't give the date at which I gave the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Meikle john, only that it was about the first week in Nov.—that was for giving me information as to the firm of Archer and Co.—I paid it him in five Bank of England notes of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—I got those notes from Burt and Co. of Cornhill, in exchange for some notes on the Bank of France—I paid them to Meiklejohn with my own hand—there was some discussion between us as to the amount—I at first said "Here is 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., Jack"—he said "This won't do"—I said "What do you mean?"—he said "It is not enough," and I said "Here is 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I had made money by the speculation of Archer and Co., perhaps about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not mean my share, the concern itself paid about that to the entire firm—the "Bill" referred to in one of the letters is Walters; he kept the Grapes public house in Red Lion Street, Holborn—Heiklejohn afterwards told me that he had purchased a house with the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

Just say whether you will come here or meet me.") "S. X." means The Silver Cross—there was an arrangement made at the end of December, 1874, with Benson, Walters, and Murray, for bringing out the Society for Insurance against Losses on the Turf—that firm was established at Gresham House and at 25, Moorgate Street—I first met Benson about February, 1874—this new firm continued for about three months, at the expiration of which period Walters and Murray were arrested, committed for trial, released on bail, and absconded—this letter is in Meiklejohn's writing.

I will write you again soon.—I am, &amp;c, &amp;c. (signed) Blockhead.") I don't know what the first part of that letter refers to about H. or B. M.—I have no doubt I did know at the time—"Send me the paper with Chieftain registered in it" referred to a local paper published in the Isle of Wight announcing that Chief Inspector Clarke had arrived there at one of the hotels—"How did the Old Chieftain come to speak of the Countryman as a blockhead?"—that was in consequence of a conversation I had with Benson, and I wrote to Meiklejohn to tell him—"Chieftain" is Chief-Inspector Clark, and "Countryman" is Meiklejohn—"P. has left this day for America," that is Chief-Inspector Palmer—Meiklejohn signs himself "Blockhead," that was in consequence of what I had written to him—I can't tell who "Publican" is; it was either "Walters or Colkett, I should say—I can't remember which—they both kept public-houses—"Bill" is Bill Mitchell. a racing<lb/>man—I think I first saw Palmer in July, 1872—I first saw him to speak to him, I think, about 1874—I first met him at one of the race<lb/>courses; I can't tell which—he was in the habit of attending races in the course of his duty as an inspector of the detective department—there was a warrant out against me in respect of the Walters and Murray transac<lb/>tion—I remember receiving a telegram, but I do not know who it was from, because I had left before, thinking there would be a warrant out against me—I went to a great number of places—I did not go abroad—I went to Glasgow among other places—in the course of 1875 I went to Switzerland with Benson—just before that I had been to Littlehampton; that would be about August—this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is Meiklejohn's writing—it is addressed to me in the name of W. Gifford—the post-mark on the envelope is "Ju," which stands both for June and July—I should think it would be July—I could not say positively that this letter came out of this particular envelope—all of the letters were put by me carefully—I do not know whether any one has changed them since—as far as I know they are the same. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Wednesday morning. Dear Bill,—You will see from the enclosed letter that W. has sent a letter to your brother, and he is afraid that it may be opened. You had better see to it at once.") About June, 1875, I was living at that address under that name—this other letter of August, 1875, is Meiklejohn's—I was then' living at Littlehampton as Sinclair; this is addressed to Sinclair.

W. and M. in this letter refers to Walters and Murray—that letter is also in the handwriting of Meiklejohn, and was addressed to me with the communication referred to in it as having been received by Meiklejohn from Wilson.

This correspond<lb/>ence was shortly before I went to Switzerland—I was there a fortnight with Benson—he travelled under the name of Count Montague—when we returned he went to the Langham Hotel, I did not—I went there to see him, and on one occasion Meiklejohn went with me—Benson passed there as Yonge—up till that time I believe that Benson and Meiklejohn were not acquainted with each other—I introduced them to each other—I did not leave them alone on this particular occasion—at this time, so far as I knew, the warrant was still out against me in connection with the Walters and Murray transactions—up till this time I had not known Inspector Clarke—at that time I had in my possession a letter which Clarke had written to Walters, landlord of the Grapes public-house, Holborn—Meiklejohn gave me that letter—I learned from Benson that he was acquainted with Clarke—I took means to overhear what passed in a conversation between Benson and Clarke at the Langham—Benson occu<lb/>pied a sitting-room, and I went into the adjoining bedroom—I knew that Clarke was coming—this was during the time that Benson was living at the Langham Hotel as Tonge, after our return from Switzerland—at that time he went on crutches, and had to be carried about—I did not hear a great deal of the conversation—all I can recollect is that Clarke said "No one will interfere with Kurr now"—I believe Clarke said "Will Kurr bring me my letter back?" or "Will Kurr send me my letter back?"—it was something with reference to the letter, but I can't tell you what it was—I wanted to hear from Clarke whether or not I was safe to walk about—I can't give a date for that nearer than the latter end of August or the commencement of Sept.—I procured this letter to be written to Clarke—Street wrote it. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "To Mr. Chief Inspector George Clarke, Scotland Yard.

By forwarding a letter to the above address you will much oblige—Tours obediently, Wm. Kurr.") I gave the letter to Street—I do not know how he forwarded it—at the time Benson was staying at the Langham he had a French servant with him named Pierre Pionchon—Benson had at one time another servant, named either Wallace or Picard—I don't think it was Picard who was staying with him at the Langham at this time—after I had overheard this conversation at the Langham Hotel, I went and saw Clarke myself at Great College Street, Westminster—I found him near his house—I said "Good evening, Mr. Clarke, my name is William Kurr"—Clarke said "Don't you think you are a bold man to come to me when you</p>

One of these is torn—the torn one is the original—I have not seen them from that time till they were produced at the police court—it was perhaps three days—at least it was a short time after the interview at the Langham that I saw Clarke and handed him those two letters—this letter dated 22nd September, 1875, is in Meiklejohn's writing.

And you can ask him why I am not at the meet, and then tell him it is useless for me to appear in the matter, that you can settle these matters yourselves.

I cannot understand your letter as to Tommy wanting his wages and expenses. What Tommy do you mean? Do you mean Old Bill; if so, what does he want? Let me know about the horse, Argument, in time, as I want to let Power, the Old Man at Milbank, know; but I should like to be as sure as possible. He is a good pal of mine. I had a letter from Poodle this morning, in which he says that he expects a letter from Chieftain saying that the matter of mine will be settled in my favour. I simply told him the matter was settled Saturday week, and C. never intended me to get it, as he recommended D. him<lb/>self.") The post-mark on the envelope of that letter is October 11th, 1875—the "factory" means Scotland Yard—I don't know who "W." is—it is relative to some racing transaction—oh, it would mean Wilson, of Glasgow—"Tommy" is the nickname of a clerk of mine who had com<lb/>plained</p>

The Autumn races at Brighton are held on 31st October—this letter is Meiklejohn's writing. "Saturday Night. Dear Bill,—Yours to hand. I am not going to Brighton, only Dustman and Lansdown, neither of whom know you, so there is no need for you fearing them. Have you heard from Poodle?" "120 x 20 Wizard, L'pool C." That is the odds against a horse named Wizard for the Liverpool Cup—I remember going to the Brighton races on 31st October, and Wizard tells me the year, it was 1875—"Dustman" means Druscovich—I had never spoken to Druscovich at that time—Lansdown was a sergeant of police; that is his proper name—I knew them by sight, although they did not know me—I saw them at the Brighton races—at that time I was living in Marquess Road—I lived there from about 1874 to 1877, until I was taken into custody, in my own name, William Kurr—in the year 1875 I gave Meiklejohn 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was at the latter end of July—there was also a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on another occasion—I first saw Drus<lb/>covich to speak to him on 10th April, 1876—this letter is in Meiklejohn's writing.

"Poodle" there is Benson—"Fluister" is a City sergeant of police—I don't think the warrants against Walters and Murray were ever in his hands; he held a betting-house warrant issued in the City, I heard so from Fluister himself—"P." also means Poodle, that is Benson—these two letters are Meiklejohn's writing.

Druscovich is in a sad plight, he has got a bill to meet"—Meiklejohn said "I have told him you will lend it him. It comes nicely. It will save us both trouble. All you have to do is to lend him the money"—This ended in an appointment for next evening at the public-house in Fentiman Road—it is the only public-house in that road—I think it is the Fentiman's Arms—I said "I shall not be able to give Druscovich the money to-morrow, but I will come and see him at eight o'clock"—I went there at eight o'clock on Sunday and saw Druscovich and Meiklejohn—I said to Druscovich "Meiklejohn has told me you want to borrow 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.," and Druscovich said "Yes"—I said "I will lend it to you to-morrow"—Druscovich said "Where shall I see you to-morrow?"—I said "I will meet you at the Oriental Restaurant at five o'clock"—the Oriental Restaurant is at the Blackfriars station—I gave Colkett a cheque of mine for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to get cashed—it was dated the 16th April, 1876, and payable to Colkett's order—it was endorsed "H.

He said "I did not like walking down here with Bill. Suppose we ran against old Clarke"—I said "What did you say?"—Meiklejohn said "I said 'Don't be a fool. Bill has got them all right at our place and in the City too"—I said "Did you tell him about Bailey in the City?"—Meiklejohn said "Yes; I told him about Bailey, and told him everything"—I said "I did not want you to tell him about Bailey"—he said "Oh, it don't matters a damn"—I remember nothing further—we parted at Ludgate Hill—this letter is Meiklejohn's writing.

Who does the horse you name belong to? What has become of Activity? Smith promised to let me know. If you get this in time let me know Your brother had better not go for any more letters. It is too hot. There</p>

               <p>are some there, but he had better not go. The old man has sent Andrews, and he has got the description. Be sure and let me know as early as possible the strength of this horse.") "The old man" alluded to there is Clarke—my brother, is Frederick Kurr—I suppose that alluded to some fraud that my brother and another person had been carrying on, not one of the turf frauds, I think—I don't know exactly what it refers to—it had nothing to do with me—"Andrews" is a police serjeant—I saw Clarke after September, 1875, at Epsom, and at Sandown Park races, where he was on duty as an inspector—these letters are (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in Meikle John's writing—this one with Clarke's address on was written about two days before I saw Clarke, that would be early in September, 1875—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Wednesday Night, 11.30 p.m. Dear Bill,—Your letter to hand. Just now the Chieftain's address is 20, Great College Street, not 17. If you have sent it you are wrong. Be sure about the horse as I am in a corner, but shall I see you and talk about Poodle? You have not written fully.") (" Wednesday morning. Dear Bill,—You will find enclosed the Chieftain's letter all right, as also one from Kramp. He is a scamp. You see his game. He wants to keep Poodle in a funk. You must not let him know I have sent his letter to you. I have not written him, and never intend to do so. When shall I have a chat to hear all news about Chieftain? Have you forgotten about the horse? Be sure to put something on, unless you send me as usual the name of the thing beforehand. P.S.—I forgot to tell you that we had a letter from Mrs. W., saying that she was to sail from Southampton on Monday last for America.") I think that both those letters are about the same date—the letter spoken of as Chieftain's letter enclosed, is the letter that I made a fac simile of—that is the letter I got from Meiklejohn—I went abroad on 19th July, 1876, and joined Benson in Paris—we stopped at the Hotel de Evrement, some<lb/>where at the back of the Madeleine—I stayed with Benson three days—after Paris we went to Dover, and from there to the Cannon Street Hotel, where we were met by Meiklejohn on the platform—I had telegraphed an appointment from Dover—we dined at the Cannon Street Hotel, Meikle<lb/>john, Benson, Bale, and myself—nothing was said then about opening a racing firm at Dover—it was in reference to opening a Paris loan—after that Benson went to live at Canonbury, at Mrs. Bruce's—on 14th July I saw Clarke at Sandown Park races, when a horse called Medora won—we had a conversation, but simply about the horse—he knew me as attending races, and I knew <hi rend="italic">him</hi> as a police inspector—Benson also lived at Mrs. Ethel's, in the name of Yonge, I believe—that is in Beresford Road, Canonbury—I came back from Paris about 23rd July, and in August the scheme was prepared for what are called the De Goncourt frauds—Benson, Bale, my brother, and myself were parties to it—we were to get money by publishing a newspaper containing an article stat<lb/>ing that the bookmakers did not give sufficient odds—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the newspaper—it is called <hi rend="italic">The Sport</hi>, and is numbered 1,713—it was printed in Edinburgh, and a translation into French was sent to various persons in France—the article suggests that the bookmakers would not give the fair odds to persons well known to be skilled in horses, so that if any body in France was inclined to bet through Mr. Montgomery they might make a commission, and he would make his bargain with the book-makers—the cheques for Mr. Montgomery were to be sent to anybody who would consent to act as agent, and he was to send them to certain</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220088"/>
               <p>bookmakers who were named—it was for writing those fictitious cheques in the names of non-existing persons that I was convicted—these are the cheques (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which I procured to be engraved for the purpose of the fraud—they are on the Royal Bank of London, Agar Street, Strand—there is no such bank—they were to be made available to get people's money by inducing them to send their own money as well as these sham cheques of Mr. Montgomery—I wrote this leading article in English first and Benson made the grammatical corrections—the translation was printed to be sent to the paper, so that if they doubted the French translation they had the English newspaper to compare with it—No. 8, Northumber<lb/>land Street, Mr. Flintoff's office, was taken for the purpose of the fraud—this is the agreement—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated 31st August for rooms at</hi> 8, <hi rend="italic">North<lb/>umberland Street for four weeks, for 61.</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">s., renewable one day before the expiration of any four weeks</hi>)—I was at Flintoff's during the day, from 9.30 to about 5, and Flintoff saw me there from time to time during the day Inspector Clarke gave evidence on the trial that I was at Sandown Races that day, but it was not true—I was not there at all—in the progress of this business I received between 14,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 15,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from abroad—be<lb/>sides 8, Northumberland Street, other places were taken where cheques were to be sent to, Montgomery's in Fleet Street, Francis's in Cleveland Row, and Ellerton's in Duke Street—my brother Frederick represented Montgomery, Bale represented Ellerton, and my brother also re<lb/>presented Charles Jackson at, I think, St. James's Place—my brother was also Jacob Francis at Cleveland Row—Bale was Richard Gregory; he was, I think, in Duke Street—it was arranged that the places should be in the south-west district, because we had bribed two of the post inspectors of that district to give us information, when the letters were stopped—I was introduced to those men to bribe them by Meikle john on 10th August—on the first Saturday in August I said to Meikle john "The French police have telegraphed to Dover, and stopped our letters," referring to the Dover frauds, the loan company—he said "I suppose you are going to try something else?"—I said "I am going to try to get those letters from the French police first"—he said "How are you going to do that?"—I said "I am going to send a forged telegram in the name of Mr. Williamson to the police at Paris"—and I said that Benson had got the French telegram destroyed by the Dover police—he said "How will you account for sending the telegram from London when the inquiry was at Dover?"—I said that I should pretend that the telegram had been sent to Scotland Yard to reply to—he said "There will be a stink about that when that is found out, what do you intend doing next? have you got any idea in your head?"—I said "Yes"—he said "What is it?"—I said "I am going to publish a newspaper, and am going home to-night to write the article"—he said "What is it about?"—I said "Similar to what you call the <hi rend="italic">muddle again</hi>—there will be a <hi rend="italic">duffing</hi> bank in it—(I had previously given him the outline of a scheme which he called the <hi rend="italic">muddle again</hi>)—he said "When are you going to start it?"—I said "I shall lose no time about it, I am going home to do it to-night"—he said "Have you told <hi rend="italic">Poodle</hi> about it?" meaning Benson—I said "No; I will tell him when he returns from Dover," and I said "Let me know if anything turns up about that forged telegram—he said "All right"—that was all that passed—on 2nd September I was present at a dinner at Ethel's with Benson and Meiklejohn, when my</p>

               <p>groom, Goldie, brought a telegram for Meiklejohn, which my wife had given him—it was sent by Meiklejohn's wife to my care, and I being absent, my groom brought it—it referred to the Gainsborough picture—after receiving it Meiklejohn left—I also saw Druscovich at Ascot races, when he told me he had found a pocket-book belonging to Mr. Collette—it did not relate to the frauds—Druscovich, Shaw, and I went to a refresh<lb/>ment bar—this letter is in Meiklejohn's writing—(" 202, South Lambeth Road, S.W. Monday Morning. Dear Bill,—I have written the Dust<lb/>man saying that I had a letter from you this morning, asking him to meet you at the Swan public-house, Clapham Road, at 8 p.m. this day Mon<lb/>day. Do you know how things stand?")—I met Druscovich at the Swan—he said "I have a letter from Meiklejohn telling me to meet you here"—I said "Yes, go inside, I want to speak to you"—and I said "I am going to open a private betting office, inviting persons in Prance to bet"—he said "Is it a legitimate affair?"—I said "Yes, I want you to tell me when any application is made for warrants, or when any complaints come"—he said "What is the name?"—I said "Montgomery; here is 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you"—he said "I already owe you something," and he refused it, and I put the money in his pocket—it was in a small bag in gold—he said "How am I to communicate with you if anything turns up?" and "I know, I will write to you in such a way that nobody will understand it but you and I"—that was the end of that interview—a little later, about September, I saw Clarke—I had written a letter making an appointment, and called at his house at eight o'clock—he said "You wanted to see me"—I said "Yes, you know that I have got several horses"—he said "Yes"—I said "I intend entering them to race here and advising persons in France to back them"—he said "What do the people in France know about your horses?"—I said "They will know when I tell them"—Clarke said. "That won't pay"—I said "I will make that pay," and "Here is fifty for you," and I gave him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a bag—he took it—I said "I will send you some post-cards addressed to myself, and if anything happens you pop one of them in the post and I will come and see you"—he said "Don't have post-cards"—I said "Well, I will send you some addressed envelopes"—Clarke said "What name are you using? I suppose not your own"—I said "Montgomery, and other names, but you will know that any betting affair coming from France concerns me"—I sent him some addressed envelopes one day afterwards—I went into 8, Northumberland Street, on 31st August, and continued there till the 26th September—it was about a hundred paces from the back of Scotland Yard—about 9th or 10th September Meiklejohn came in and said to Benson "It is very thick for you, <hi rend="italic">Poodle</hi>, there is a warrant out for you, and there is a warrant out for Montgomery, Jackson, and Francis," and he produced a piece of paper with those names written on it—Benson said "Do not joke, <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi>, is it a fact?"—Meiklejohn then said "No, it is only my fun, I have just come from Scotland Yard, it is all right"—I first knew Palmer in 1872—I met him first at the Angel Hotel—I saw him at the Northumberland Rooms, next door to 8, Northumberland Street, before 9th September—I said "Do you want to see Harry?"—he said "I want to see Bale"—Harry is Street; Street and Palmer were acquainted—I said "Is there any message for him?"—Palmer said "Tell him there is nothing"—Palmer then went away—Meiklejohn had gone to Derby while we were in North<lb/>umberland Street—this is his letter—("Derby, 14th September, 1876.</p>

You did not come last Sunday according to promise. I have heard nothing from J. W. C, so I think everything is safe from J. W. C") This letter is also from Derby—(" 20th September, 1876.

I send you here with a letter from Wilson of Glasgow for your perusal. I find that I must apply for assistance from you and Poodle.

I will meet you on the platform, St. Pancras, at 4.10. p.m. Saturday. We have got the house I spoke to you about.") I do not remember whether there was a letter in it—on Monday, 25th September, I left the office in my gig and saw Druscovich near the entrance of Scotland Yard—he said "lam glad I have seen you; there is a big swindle come in from Paris, 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Is it a racing affair?"—he said "No, I don't think it is, it is something to do with some spurious bills of exchange; a solicitor has been to the office"—I said "Keep the case in your hands"—he said "It is all right, I have got all the papers in my desk"—I went to Inspector Clarke about ten o'clock that night in a hansom cab belonging to a man named Porter—I drove from the cab-stand at the bottom of Ashby Road to the Bang's Arms public-house at the corner of Great College Street—(this was in consequence of receiving a piece of blotting paper in one of the envelopes which I had addressed to Clarke)—I saw Clarke there—he said "I expected you earlier"—I said "I could not get here before"—he said "There must have been some delay in the post-office"—I said "I received your letter only twenty minutes ago"—he said "There is something come in from France; I am frightened and alarmed, have you changed the notes yet?"—I said "No; will it be safe to change them now they have had time to stop them?"—I had said nothing about notes up to this point—he said "I think it will be right if you lose no time and change them to-morrow, but you must not go to any of the places or somebody will be sent there to-morrow"—The "places "were the addresses of the people concerned in the frauds—he said "It would look funny, after going there so long for letters, to have them stopped; can you account for it in any way?"—I said "I will send in some notices to get them to send on the letters to Newmarket"—Clarke said "Do some<lb/>thing"—I said "Who has got the case?"—Clarke said "Druscovich;. is he all right?"—I made some reply which I cannot recollect and left—next morning at ten o'clock I went to 8, Northumberland Street, packed the things up and left—on the same night that I saw Clarke I drove back in Porter's cab to Newington Green Road and threw a stone through Benson's window between twelve and one o'clock—I did not see him—I wrote to Druscovich the same night to make an appointment to see him at ten o'clock next morning, the 26th under the arch of the Charing Cross railway, which is close to 8, Northumberland Street—I had received a letter that day from Drus<lb/>covich, and when we mot he said "Have you got my letter?"—I said "Yes; here it is," and I returned it to him—I said "That swindle does concern me"—he was very excited and said "I know I</p>

"—Meiklejohn said "The Countess's brother kept saying '<hi rend="italic">Mon Dieu</hi>' "—I said "Have you got any warrants out?"—Druscovich said "Yes; we have got them out to-day"—I said "Who granted them?"—he said "Mr. Knox, and he said 'Don't be particular who you bring before me' "—Druscovich said "I suppose you will go to America now?"—I said "No"—Druscovich then said "I must arrest somebody over this job"—I said "Arrest me if you like," and he said "I think I will"—he also said "You have not been seen at any of the places, have you?" and I said "No"—he said "Well, you be at Fleet Street at one o'clock coming out of the Albert Club, and I will bring Clarke, or somebody from our place, and arrest you"—I said "I cannot wait about Fleet Street all day, I have got to attend to changing the notes; come to my house at nine o'clock and arrest me there"—Druscovich said "Very</p>

               <p>well"—I said "Have you got all the numbers of the notes that are stopped?"—Druscovich. said "No"—with that Druscovich left for a moment or two, and I said to Meiklejohn "Go and find out all about it, Jack"—Meiklejohn said "I will see you to-morrow, and tell you the numbers of the notes that have been stopped"—I had never been to the clubs or to Reinhardt's, so that I could not have been identified at any of those places—I went home that night, and went out next morning at nine—if I had been arrested, or if my house had been searched, there was nothing to connect me with the frauds—I saw Meiklejohn by ap<lb/>pointment next day, the 29th, at the King Lud, at the bottom of Ludgate Hill, about twelve o'clock—he produced a piece of paper, and said "I have got the numbers of those notes"—the paper he gave me only represented the numbers of some of the notes which Benson had got—I then tele<lb/>graphed to Benson—I then gave Meiklejohn 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, and made an ap<lb/>pointment to meet him again that night, which I did, at 202, South Lambeth Road, but he was in bed when I got there, and we had no conversation—I went to the Kentish Town station of the Midland Railway on the Satur<lb/>day at 4.20 and saw Druscovich, Meiklejohn joined us, and we three went to a public-house, where Druscovich said "What did you want to send that telegram to the postmaster at Newmarket for?"—that referred to my telegram on the 29th to the postmaster there to send all letters he had to Portsmouth—I had left word at the different lodgings for all letters to be forwarded to Newmarket—Druscovich told me that the postmaster had told him that, and I knew he had been down to Newmarket—Drus<lb/>covich said "I want to make a cigarette, but the paper is so bad I cannot use it"—the landlord of the house said "Oh, have you been to New-market?"—I said "He means the New Cattle Market"—and he said "Yes, I mean the New Cattle Market"—the landlord did not hear the conversation about the postmaster, but he caught the word "Newmarket"—Meiklejohn called me to one side and said "What are you going to give Druscovich?"—he had previously said at the King Lud "I suppose you have given him five cents," meaning 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said "I do not know what I shall give him yet"—he said "When are you going to pay him?"—I said "I will leave the money for him on Monday or Tuesday in a cigar box at his house"—he said "How's Poodle getting on; has he changed the notes yet?" and I replied "I expect he wall change them on Monday, how am I to <hi rend="italic">get</hi> any information from Druscovich? he is frightened to come near me; tell him to make all his business known at the office, and I am sure to know then, from others"—Meiklejohn replied "I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> tell him," and afterwards Meiklejohn did tell him in my presence to make all his business known at Scotland Yard—I do not know the name of the public-house to which I have referred; but it is situated at the first turning on the left in Leighton Road, Kentish Town, and is the only public-house near the station, and is about a minute's walk from it.</p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220093"/>
               <p>been in Glasgow changing those notes?"—I said "You soon heard of it"—he said "Yes, I suppose you have sent Yonge?"—I said "Yes"—he said "What a fool you must be to send a man like that; I suppose he was carried into the bank"—I said "Yonge has now recovered the use of his legs, so he would not be suspected"—Clarke said "You astonish me; Druscovich is going down to-night to make inquiries; where is Yonge?"—I replied "He has come back"—that was a fact—I then said to Clarke "Here is 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for you," and handed him a bag containing 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—Clarke said "Thanks"—I cashed a draft of the British Linen Company which had been given to me by Benson at Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Smith's, and changed the notes for gold at the Bank of England. (<hi rend="italic">The draft was produced, being on the British Linen Company, Glasgow, dated Oct.</hi> 30<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> 300<hi rend="italic">l. in favour of Wm.

Medway is one of the names by which I went—I told Clarke I would go and telegraph to the people in Glasgow to stop them from going to the banks—I had heard from Benson the arrangements he had made in Scotland for getting rid of the notes—I next saw Clarke on the 10th October—Benson came back on the 4th October—I went to Brighton with Benson on the 5th—I stayed at the Brighton until Tuesday, the 10th—I telegraphed to Clarke at his house on the evening of the 10th from the Brighton Company's telegraph office at Brighton Railway station—I was coming up to see Clarke on account of receiving some infor<lb/>mation—I had not at that time seen anything which attracted my atten<lb/>tion—I also telegraphed to Palmer and Von Tornow—I first went to the public-house at the corner of the South Lambeth Road—I saw Palmer there—I said to him" Have you heard anything about a cab inquiry?"—Palmer said "No"—I said "Has the Governor come back yet?"—the Governor meant Mr. Williamson—Palmer said "No"—I said "Who is in charge? "—Palmer said "Old George"—Old George is Clarke—I said "I'll go on and see him"—there was also a conversation about a racing matter, not bearing on this—the telegram I sent was sent at 4.55, and we arrived in London a few minutes after six, and I saw Clarke about seven in his house, Great College Street—Clarke said "Where did that blasted fool drive to when he left the Midland? they are going to trace the cabman"—he said "He left Glasgow with the French servant in a Pulman; it must have been quite open, or they would not have seen him; why didn't he get out at some station and come on afterwards?"—I said "It's a bad job, but we must stop the inquiry somehow"—Clarke said "How am I stop it?"—I said "Easy enough, you are in charge; send You Tornow to make the inquiry"—Clarke said "Do you know Von Tornow?"—I said "Yes"—Clarke said "I must let things take their course"—I said "I shall go to the Midland, and stop whoever you send; so you may just as well send Von Tornow"—Clarke said "Very well, I will send him—directly he comes to the office to-morrow"—Clarke said "Does any one know that you have come to see me to-night?"—I said "No," that was all—he (Clarke) walked about fifty yards with me—Benson was waiting in a cab a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> yards from Great College Street—he had come up with me from Brighton—I believe it was the same cab which we had taken when we first arrived in London—I saw the reward offered for the cabdriver on the Saturday after the conversation with Clarke—the bill produced was the one I saw (<hi rend="italic">It stated that at</hi> 8.30 <hi rend="italic">a.m. on Wednesday, the 4th inst., a man</hi>, 36 <hi rend="italic">years old, 5ft. 4 in oroft</hi> 5 <hi rend="italic">in. in height, and of Jewish appearance</hi>,</p>

I suppose you did it? You make me an offer, Bill?"—I said "500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; will that satisfy you?"—I said "Now you stand a bottle of champagne"—he said "No, make Poodle stand it"—I said "I shall have to pay you in Clydesdale notes, Jack?"—Meiklejohn said "All right, that will do as well"—this was in the evening—I said "Perhaps you will now pay me back the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you borrowed of me"—Meiklejohn said "You may go and whistle for that"—I said "I will try and catch the train at Kentish Town and give you the money"—I was going off by train—Iwent and fetched the notes and met him at the Kentish Town station—I handed them into the carriage—they were Clydesdale bank notes which I had got from Benson—Benson was with Meiklejohn at the time, and I left them together when I went to fetch the notes—I met them again at the Kentish Town station—I next saw Meiklejohn on Friday, the 20th Oct., at Derby—I went to Derby in consequence of having received a letter from Benson—when I got to Derby I had a con<lb/>versation with Benson, during a portion of which Meiklejohn was present, but during what portion I cannot remember—Meiklejohn said "I put one of those notes down in Manchester, and they made me put my name at the back; I put the name of James Turner"—Meiklejohn said also "We have sent for you to arrange about starting in another town"—I said "London won't do; what do you think of Birmingham?"—meikle john said "Do you know any of the police there?"—I said "No, but I know some one who does"—Benson said "I don't think the banking</p>

               <p>facilities would suit us there"—Meiklejohn said "How would Dundee suit you? I could introduce you to Dewar there. Young Harry knows him; he used to be superintendent of the police at Greenock"—I said "I don't think the postal arrangements would suit us at Dundee, it is too far north; I think Edinburgh would be the best town to start in; I have got Gollan square there"—Meiklejohn said "Why not get at Linton?"—I said "Do you know Linton?"—Benson was present during the whole of the conversation—Meiklejohn said "Grollan can introduce us to him"—I said "Will you and Benson go down there and get an introduction to him?"—Meiklejohn said "No, you had better come down yourself"—after that I went to Matlock—on the Tuesday following I went to New-market—while there I saw Druscovich—there was a man with him at the time standing some thirty yards off—the man seemed to be taking notice of me—I spoke to Druscovich—we had a racing conversation—I went back to London the same night—I next saw Druscovich, I think, on the 30th or 31st at Dicks' Hotel, Temple Bar—on that occasion Druscovich said "I have satisfied Abrahams to-day in an argument I had with him—I have shown him that the notes which they stopped first came in last; but somebody has mentioned your name to him; I told him the cabman had seen you, I cannot do any more"—I said to Druscovich "Who told Abra<lb/>hams about me?"—he said "The editor of a paper"—I asked him "The editor of what paper?" and he produced a letter from his pocket with "William Kurr "pencilled on the back of it—he then said "I will tell Meiklejohn the name of the paper"—I produced a copy of the <hi rend="italic">Sportsman</hi>—from my pocket, and pointed to it significantly, and Druscovich nodded—Meiklejohn. was present at this conversation—Mr. Ashley is the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Sportsman</hi>—I do not know that he knew me—Meiklejohn said "I am going back to Derby—are you coming my road, Bill?"—Druscovich said "No, don't go with him—I want to speak to you"—<hi rend="italic">with</hi> that Meiklejohn left us—I said "What is it you want to say to me?"—Druscovich said "Ride a little way in my cab with me"—I did so—he said "I have not had enough, Bill"—I said "Very well, you must have some more, what time shall I see you to-morrow?"—he said "Twelve o'clock"—I said "Where abouts"—he said "At the North<lb/>umberland Hotel"—I said "That is very near to Flintoff's"—he said "It don't matter a damn, I have had you identified," referring to the cabman seeing me, the man who was apparently looking at me at New<lb/>market—I said I would be there at twelve o'clock—I kept the appoint<lb/>ment next day, and I gave Druscovich 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and some jewellery—I had been with Benson to Benson's on Ludgate Hill, and got the jewellery on 1st November, the same day that I gave the money—I think it was a necklet or bracelet or something—I paid 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for it—on Thursday, and November, Benson went to Edinburgh—I remained in London till the next day, and then went to Leeds—I did not stay there five minutes—I met Meiklejohn there, and went on with him to Edinburgh, and ultimately on the Saturday to the Bridge of Allan, and met Benson there, that was by arrangement between Benson and myself; we stayed at the Queen's Hotel—I passed as Gifford, and Benson as Yonge, and Meikle<lb/>john in his own name—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the visitors' book—I see the name of Yonge here—I don't think that is Benson's writing—it appears to be the waiter's, with the word "London" added to it—I see my own writing here "Gifford"—before we were at the Bridge of Allan I believe</p>

               <p>it was arranged that Benson should be introduced to Mr. Monteith, of tie Alloa branch of the Clydesdale Bank, to open an account there—I did not hear the arran ement made—I know that he wasintroduced—I was not present—on the Sunday, the 5th November, we went to dinner at Dumblane—there were present at the dinner Wilson, a detective officer of Glasgow, Gollan, a detective of Edinburgh, Meikiejohn, myself, and Benson—Dumblane is about three miles from the Bridge of Allan—I had not driven over there—Benson and Meikiejohn had, or rather Benson met Meikiejohn at his house I believe—at this time I had about 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of the notes obtained in Glasgow, and Benson about the same—on the 9th I opened an account at the Alloa branch in the name of William Gifford—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the paying in slip—(<hi rend="italic">This was for</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">paid in by william Gifford on 9th Noevember</hi>, 1876)—it was in one Clydesdale note, and four others, either of the City of Glasgow Bank, or the Royal, two of each—I had got them from Benson on his return from his expedition to Scotland—while we were at the Bridge of Allan I saw accounts in the papers of this fraud, and on Friday the 10th I received a telegram—I destroyed it—it was from W. Brown, London, to Gifford, Queen's Hotel—"D. is coming down to-night. Get Shanks out of the way." The first telegram I received was at 3.20. I received three or four that day. W. Brown's came at 3.20, one from Parry about 4, I think, and another one from W. Brown about 8.20. The first one was: "If Shanks is near the Isle of Wight, let him come and see you." I can't recollect any more of that telegram—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—of course I received a duplicate of that—this was the contents of it—(<hi rend="italic">Read;</hi> "From W. Brown, London, November 6th. West Strand Postal District, 3.24. To W. Gifford, Queen's Hotel, Bridge of Allan. If Shanks is near the Isle of Wight let him leave at once, and see you, a letter follows.") The next one was from Parry to Gifford—Street passed by the name of Parry—it was—"The air is very bracing here; shall go to London; not being interested, don't care about throwing a chance away." That came from Edinburgh about 8.20, I should think—I was in the act of leaving the hotel when the last telegram came—we had been dining together—I read it, and took it upstairs to Benson—that was the one. "D. is coming down to-night, let Shanks keep out of the way." Of course I guessed that D. was Druscovich, and Shanks Benson—there was no pre-arranged name, but I understood that—finding that Druscovich was coming down that night, I had a conversation with Benson, and left for Glasgow—I knew that William Brown was Palmer; at least, I did not know that of my own knowledge—when I got to Glasgow I telegraphed to Palmer—this is the telegram. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "From Gifford, Post Office, Glasgow, to Palmer, 38, Methley Street, Kennington Cross, London. Your telegram received.

I received a reply at 4 a.m.—I destroyed it—the reply I received was—"D. is coming down, and will meet the cabman in Edinburgh." I cannot be certain as to the wording of that telegram—it asked for a reply to three questions, but I had read another telegram in the meantime, so I did not trouble myself at all about this telegram—the telegram I read in the meantime was from</p>

               <p>Mr. Wilson—I read it in the detectives' room at the Central Police Office in Glasgow, about three in the morning—that was from Wilson to the superintendent of police, Glasgow—I had sent the telegram to Palmer, I think about 12.45, or about 12 at night, and received the reply about 4 a.m.—you see that telegram answered the three questions that I wanted to know—I then went to Edinburgh, and from there I telegraphed to Druscovich at the police-office in Meiklcjohn's name—this is it.

Can give you information; must see you without fail; will wait till you come; important; come immediately on receipt of this.") I went to the corner of Prince's Street at ten o'clock—I saw Druscovich, and we went into the Rutland Hotel—I said to Druscovich "I suppose you are going to the Bridge of Allan?"—he said "Yes"—I said "I suppose you got your information from the servant girl in the Isle of Wight?"—Druscovich said "Yes, and a gentleman who was connected with Yonge's bankruptcy has been to the office"—I said "If you don't go to the Bridge of Allan I will give you l,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—Druscovichsaid "I must go"—I said "If you go making inquiries you will settle Meikle<lb/>john, he has introduced Yonge to a bank manager there"—Druscovich said "I can't help it, I must go"—I said "You will find a letter there from Palmer, don't give that up"—Druscovich said "Why don't you go to the Bridge of Allan, and get the letters away first"—I said "If I do I shall be seen by McNab the cabman"—Druscovich said "I will keep in the hind part of the train, and you go near the engine"—this is the telegram I spoke of just now—I have never seen Druscovich write.

I had seen a duplicate of that—Drus<lb/>covich and I were together at this interview for about fifteen minutes—after seeing Druscovich I telegraphed to Benson, as from Jackson to Clarkson, to Linlithgow, or Perth, I cannot recollect which—I went to Carlisle, then to Leeds, and ultimately to Derby to Meiklejohn's house—Benson had arrived there before me—this would be Sunday the 12th November—Benson and I stopped at Derby with Meiklejohn hour hours—duringthat time an arrangement was made as to what was to become of me and Ben<lb/>son—it was arranged that Benson should go to Leicester, and that I should go to London, and find out from Scotland Yard what Druscovich had been doing—I communicated to Meiklejohn what had passed between me and Druseovich—I have no recollection of Meiklejohn saying anything as to what proof there would be about his having been at the Bridge of Allan—I had left 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. behind me at the Alloa bank—in order to get that back 1 sent Murray with these two cheques to Alloa on the 13th—(<hi rend="italic">One of these was drawn by Henry Yonge for</hi> 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">and the other by William Gifford for</hi> 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">both in favour of Mr. Carson</hi>)—on the 13th I received a telegram from Meiklejohn—I destroyed it—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the original in Meikle<lb/>john's writing.

I have advised him to go sick"—Clarke also said "They have got one of mine on blotting-paper, a few words in a printed hand, which they cannot identify"—I said "It was Druscovich's fault for bringing them back"—he said "Druscovich is a man I don't trust, do you? How long have you known him?"—I said "About six months"—Clarke said "How long have you known Von Tornow?"—I said "About two years"—Clarke said "They suspect him. Did you send a telegram to Druscovich while you were in Edinburgh?"—I said "Yes"—Clarke said "The Scotchmen put the blame on us"—I said "I don't think there is a case against Murray"—Clarke said "Who is that man Savory? when he came to Scotland Yard he said 'If you search the public-houses round you will find Kurr with all the money in his pocket' "—I said "Savory is a man of bad character, and has been convicted of perjury"—Clarke said "I</p>

E. F."—I do not recollect what that card was for; some unimportant affair—Mr. Froggatt went off that night by the train—I saw him about a week after in Southampton Row—lie said "I have seen Morton and the others, and I have seen the Minister of Justice; they only hear evidence of iden<lb/>tity"—he said "I gave the governor over there a <hi rend="italic">tenner;</hi> he put Collins on black bread and water, so I got that altered"—Collins was my brother, Frederick Kurr—I said "What sort of man is the governor?"'—he said "he did not know what to make of that 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, he has never seen so much in his life"—Froggatt said "Were you thinking of getting at him, then?"—I said "Yes"—he said "If you go over there they will very likely stick to you, they have made a lot of inquiries about you"—he said "I have got a French directory to get from the Southborough Road"—I said "My gig is waiting here, I will drive you there;" and I drove to my own house first with him—as I was coming out from my house I met</p>

Meiklejohn said "Oh yes, you can trust him for your life"—I think there was nothing further beyond arranging to meet Sawyer—that was the 20th December—the last interview that I have spoken of that I had with Clarke was about the 30th November—I next saw him about the 8th December, I think, at the Duke of York steps—he said "I thought you got that man Yonge away to America; what a foolish thing to send that telegram to Rotterdam; the governor suspects one of us, he says he will make an example if he finds out who sent it," and "I thought the other two (referring to Bale and my brother, who were arrested) were in <hi rend="italic">New</hi> York"—I said "I told them to go, I could not help it"—he said "Yonge has given a letter out by some Dutchman saying that if you do not get him out he will tell all he knows"—this letter was intended to reach me in some way—I said "Who are translating the documents for the Treasury?"—Clarke said "Albert"—I said "Is there any chance of me getting at them?"—Clarke said "What shall you do?"—I said "Put them behind the fire"—Clarke said "Ah, you are too late"—he asked who the other two men were—I said "One is my brother"—the other was Bale, but I do not remember whether I told him so or not—I saw Clarke again on 29th December by appointment at the same place—I said "I have heard from a man named Sawyer, he has made an offer to settle the prosecution"—Clarke said "Palmer has <hi rend="italic">told</hi> me some<lb/>thing about it, I do not believe in it"—Clarke also said, "I will tell you something, Mr. Abrahams came to me and showed me your letters, and said 'How are we to get this money?'" and he had previously told me that he intended getting a warrant out for you"—I said "Froggatt has got the clerk squared at Marlborough Street, so I shall know when they make application for a warrant"—Clarke said "You are only a boy, I have had experience before you were born; never you trust a lawyer"—I said "They can only give Yonge two years for what they are going: to extradite him for"—he said "Oh, can't they, did not they give Von</p>

               <p>handed it to Froggatt—I then said "I think perhaps you had better leave that till to-morrow, and come and see me up at the court, I might want you there"—I also said "How do you account for this? I suppose Sawyer was <hi rend="italic">nosing</hi> for Mr. Abrahams?"—Froggatt said "I cannot account for it"—I saw him the next day at Marlborough Street police-court—I said "Will you send Stenning to Flintoff, and to the potman at the Northumberland Hotel? tell Flintoff to say that he make a mistake last night; the light was bad, and he made a mistake in identifying me"—Froggatt said he would send Stenning to Flintoff—then I saw Froggatt a second time—he said "I have seen Flintoff myself; I have offered him fifty <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>"—I said "What did he say?"—Froggatt said "He did not agree; but if he cannot do you any good, he won't do you any harm"—Froggatt also said "I have told him that you are a brother mason"—I said "All right; what about the potman at the Northumberland Hotel?"—he said "Stenning has promised him a <hi rend="italic">fiver</hi>; he says he won't identify you"—he also said "I have arranged with Stenning to stand just in the door of the court so that he can pop into the dock instead of you"—I said "That is all nonsense; tell Stenning to leave the court at once"—when I was brought up before the magistrate, Flintoff was examined as a witness, and identified me—in the course of the examination Stenning was pointed out by one of the detectives who arrested me, as one who sought to rescue me, and upon that Stenning was ordered into custody—I saw Froggatt the day after Stenning had been tried in this court for that rescue—Froggatt said "What ought that Flintoff to be done to; ought not he to be <hi rend="italic">lagged?"</hi>—I said "Yes"—Froggatt said "What would you give?"—I said "50"—Froggatt said "I will take you at your word; I have got a summons out against him to-day, returnable next Thursday, that will suit you; I have got two good witnesses"—I said "Who are they?"—he said "My clerk, Lewis, and a client of mine, both heard Flintoff offer me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "Those witnesses would not be enough"—I said "Cannot you get Savory to swear that he heard the conversa<lb/>tion "—Savory was a witness who was called in the case—he said "No; Savory is a villain; once a villain, always a villain"—he said "I am going now to instruct George Lewis to prosecute"—that was all on that occasion.</p>

I am twenty-six years of age—my father was a baker in the Caledonian Road—I began to earn a living when I was about fourteen, as a clerk on the South-Eastern Railway—I remained there about twelve months, and then ran away—after that I took to racing, backing horses at the London Clubs, George Yard, Exchange, at the bottom of Snow Hill, where they bet in a yard—I remained there about twelve months—then I went to a money-lender's, West or Haines, in Brook Street, Grosvenor Square—it was called the Grosvenor Investment Society, or something like that—it was a money lending concern—I was a clerk—I stayed there six months—the com<lb/>pany went to rack and ruin, shut up, and I went back to racing—from the year 1871 up to the time of my arrest I derived my living by plundering and swindling the public—from the time that I left the company up to 1871 I continued betting on the turf—my first fraudulent venture was in St. John Street Road, City—that was a turf affair, backing horses that did not have a chance—a man named Howard was associated with me in the John Street scheme—no one</p>

               <p>you that Benson was in the previous fraud, the Glasgow one—Archer and C lasted about six days—it was a system of betting in Prance, fraudulent betting—that is the place where I used to send Street to way<lb/>lay letters, and I used to remain in the street to waylay Street—I some<lb/>times went for the letters myself, but generally sent Street to get them, then waylaid him to get the letters from him—we made about 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the six days in the Strand—the scheme was my invention, carried out by Benson—Benson used to translate the articles into French and write the French correspondence—that was the fraud where Street was taken into custody by Druscovich—then Archer and Co., after Street was given into custody and taken to Scotland Yard, was moved from London to Brighton, notice being given to the Post Office authorities in London to forward all correspondence to Archer and Co. to a certain address in Brighton—it lasted there about a week—we received there something under 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—then as far as England is concerned Archer and Co. col<lb/>lapsed, we carried it on in West Regent Street, Glasgow—we made about 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. there, defrauding foreigners—the profits were shared almost equally by Benson, myself, Street, and Bale—Bale's share came to about 1,100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the next thing was Walters and Murray, insurances against losses on the turf—we did not derive any profit from that, because the remittances were all stopped at the post office, and the accounts that we sent for advertisements were detained by the St. Petersburg police—we made use of Savory to get a number of gentlemen to go before the secretary to the post office to say that one of our companions, Montague, was a respectable man, in order to get the letters—Savory had 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for getting Lord Clinton to come up—I do not know whether he pocketed the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or gave it to Lord Clinton to come up and identify Montague—I think I gave Savory about another 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for getting Colonel Chamberlain to appear to give the same false testimony—also a sovereign to somebody else—I think Walters settled with Dr. Owen Evans, and I think he had 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be a witness at the application before the Lord Mayor for the parcels, and to appear at the General Post Office and say he knew Montague as a respect<lb/>able man—that was false—Walters also settled with a Captain Berkeley—I cannot answer that the amounts I am giving you are ail correct; I am giving them as near as I can—Savory got them to come—I was privy to it—I was to pay Savory about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the solicitor, Mr. Stokes, of Chancery Lane, took them before the secretary, except Lord Clinton—I know Daniel Porch and George Manning—Berkeley gave Meiklejohn informa<lb/>tion, that his (Berkeley's) name was improperly used by me—Berkeley was induced to meet me at Elphinstone's wine-shop in Holloway—that was a scheme of myself and Meiklejohn to get his letters—I do not know of his being induced to come by means of false telegrams—Walters and Murray were afterwards apprehended on warrants—no revolvers were used at the interview with Berkeley, nor knuckledusters, nor bludgeons, nor anything of the sort—Porch gave us the papers; they were thrown on the fire and destroyed by Waiters—Berkeley subsequently informed against us all, and warrants were issued—Walters and Murray were acquitted of the charge of assault and then re-arrested—Berkeley swore falsely—I would not do that—the City of Paris Loan was the next fraud of Benson, Bale, and myself—it was Benson's invention—that was a loss—it existed about a week, and was carried on at Dover and in London—the De Goncourt was the next fraud—I and my creatures bribed the</p>

When I was in the House of Detention Benson and I were in frequent communica<lb/>tion by letter—not personally—I told you that I could tamper with the locks of the cells at the police-station, but I did not—I communicated with Benson at the House of Detention by putting notes behind the officers' heels—I also communicated by means of perforated zinc with my visitors; not with Benson—my visitors were a man named Hines and another named Higgins, who was one of the witnesses I called to support my perjured <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>—I was forty days in the House of Detention—I was in communication with Benson only occasionally during that time, extending over about thirty days, perhaps—I was in Newgate before my trial from February 10th to April 16th—I communicated with Benson by letter in Newgate through the solicitor Mr. Humphreys and his clerk—I swear I wrote on my solicitor's instructions, and told my solicitor to show it to Benson—that happened about ten times, perhaps—I also gave Benson letters in chapel—I also communicated with the outside world from Newgate with Colkett, who is my brother-in-law, Street, Higgins, Hines, Meiklejohn, Brown, and Hood—I don't recollect any one else—I sent out of Newgate about ten letters, perhaps, to these different parties before my conviction—I passed them out by a solicitor—a pseudo-soli<lb/>citor—I invented a solicitor; he was Hood—some of my letters to Benson were written in ordinary language and some in slang—some could only be understood by Benson and myself—I had written to Street as "Dear Parry" while I was in Newgate—I did not write to him that Iwas offered two "stretches" instead of ten to give information against the "coppers"—two "stretches" meaning two years—of course I know what you mean—you ask me if I have written in slang, and that is a slang term;—I have not sent any letter or paper out of Millbank since my conviction—I swear I have not sent a piece of paper out to Fred Hines charging Street with having given up one of my letters written out of Newgate to the defendants—I have not written any such letter, or that I would give Meiklejohn a great deal more "Tea-garden stuff"—I know what "Garden stuff" means—not "Tea-garden stuff"—"Garden-stuff" is a slang term for giving information to the police of any stolen property—I know nothing about a piece of paper addressed to Froggatt left at a barber's shop at Thornhill, Barnsbury, since my conviction—I swear amongst the letters I wrote in Newgate I wrote one which was produced at the trial purporting to come from Bale's father—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was found on Benson in Newgats—I believe Bale has no father—it was to be sent to Benson's father in order to get him to assist his son—that was not a forgery—it is a draft of it—it is a fictitious document—it was passed to Benson for his approval before it was sent out, and was subsequently found on him and taken away—I can imitate some handwriting—Meiklejohn's letters are impossible to forge—I have therefore imitated none—I said before the</p>

I gave him was not a sum of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. that I lent Meiklejohn, and which he repaid to me—I was constantly in the habit of meeting different detectives at race meetings, and talking to them—I frequently gave them informa<lb/>tion, racing information, not any other kind of information—I should not betray a friend, or I should have had my liberty before this—I have been offered my liberty if I would betray my friends—I don't know whether I shall get my liberty or not—I swore before the magistrate that I hoped to get a remission of my sentence, and that was the reason I gave my evidence; that is not betraying a friend—I know a man called <hi rend="italic">Flash</hi> Fred—I have seen him on race-courses—I did not give information to the police about him—I know <hi rend="italic">Steve</hi> Raymond, he was taken into custody for forgery—I did not give information to Meiklejohn about him, or where he was to be found—he was taken into custody by Palmer—I don't know where; it was in the neighbourhood of the Blue Coat Boy public-house—he had come up from the country—on my oath I did not betray him; the man who betrayed him was Meiklejohn's friend, Burke—Meiklejohn had intro<lb/>duced Burke to me—he is dead—Meiklejohn told me to send Raymond in the country, because Shore had got a warrant—he did go into the country, and came up again, and was then taken into custody—I never personated a detective—I remember Coletso, he represented himself to Benson as a man of means, not to me or in my presence—I incurred certain expenses in telegraphing abroad to find out, and did find out, that he was a swindler—I never saw Coletso in Benson's presence—I did not represent myself as a detective in that matter—I went to the Midland Hotel to get the money, but I never said who I was—I went to get back 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the cost of the tele<lb/>grams to Galveston, Texas—I certainly did not on that occasion represent myself as a detective—I did not at any time tell Meiklejohn that I had got certain blank cheques on certain banks, or ask him to go the banks and see what they would give to get the cheques back—I remember asking Meiklejohn if he would give me some Bank of England cheques, and he said he would—I never gave him any blank cheques—I did not represent to Meiklejohn that I knew where the Gainsborough picture was, and could give information about it—I told him that I did not believe the picture was ever stolen—if Benson has sworn that I represented myself as a detective in the Coletso affair, that is untrue—before I was examined at Bow Street I gave perhaps thirty or forty written statements to the Trea<lb/>sury—I have given one long one since my examination at Bow Street—, that was in instalments, I cannot write 600 or 700 pages of foolscap in one day—I suppose there were about forty instalments altogether, more or less; it was all in one narrative—I have not had any interview with anybody in the prison since my examination at Bow Street—I made up my mind when I gave my evidence to say all I was asked, about anybody—I don't know whether I mentioned at Bow Street that Meiklejohn had told me he had changed a note in the name of Turner, at Manchester—it is perfectly true—probably I did not state it to the magistrate—I know I told the Treasury so—I don't know that I did not say it at Bow Street—I don't know that after I was examined a man was called who proved that Meiklejohn had changed a note in the name of Turner at Manchester; this is the first time I have heard of it—</p>

               <p>I believe I did not not say anything at Bow Street about Meiklejohn calling the De Goncourt fraud a medley or a muddling story—I was not asked—I said it in my statement—I don't know that Benson said it after I had been examined—I have not communicated with the outer world" since I have been in Millbank—I am under the charge of the principal warder—the interview between Benson and Clarke at the Langham Hotel lasted about twenty minutes—I put myself in the bedroom to hear what passed; the door was shut—I was to hear through the keyhole—I did not put my ear there, but I judged that would be the simplest way for the sound to pass through—I heard some of it; a small portion—I hare told you a very small portion of a good many other twenty minutes, if I told you all it would take me three months—I have told you the whole that I remember of what I heard—the De Goncourt scheme was my in<lb/>vention, the actual scheme was invented on the 5th August, at my house—the outline of the scheme I had known for some time, but I wrote the article on Saturday; the draft of it—I communicated the scheme to Benson on his return from Dover, that would be on the Sunday, at my house, but I commuuicated with him, I think, at his house—I don't know whether it was first communicated to him at his house or mine; it was either at mine or his. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> "When did you first discover that Yonge was Benson? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know it until I was told by Clarke, about the 17th November, 1876; up to that time I did not know that Yonge was Benson, who had been convicted of forgery on the Lord Mayor—I don't know now that he has been convicted of forgery; he was convicted of fraud, not forgery. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You did not think your scheme was a forgery, did you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Nor did you; I did not, simply by your advice—I did not believe at the time that I had committed forgery—I gave 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Von Tornow on 11th October, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the Christmas before, at the Oxford Arms—no one was present—we went into a public-house in Judd Street—there was a potman there present—I don't know whether he saw it or not—I gave it him all in gold—when I was taken into custody I had a loaded revolver on me—I did not anticipate that I was going to be taken into custody—I did not tell Mr. Pollard that at the time I was arrested I was going to meet Sawyer; I said I was going to meet Clarke—I did not tell Mr. Pollard that Sawyer and Froggatt wanted me to let them have the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Clydesdale bank notes that they might pay them into a bank in their own names, and hold them for me, nor that I had told them I would take time to consider with my friends, and that I felt sure they meant to stick to the money, and that under those circumstances, and fear<lb/>ing that Sawyer knew too much of my affairs, I had made an appoint<lb/>ment to meet them that Sunday night for the purpose of handing him the notes—I told Mr. Pollard that the appointment was to take place at an empty house—I did not say with Sawyer alone—I did not tell him that the appointment was for Sunday night; I said Monday—I had no ap<lb/>pointment, only with Clarke; nor did I say so—I said I had made an appointment with Sawyer at an empty house—that was true—I was carrying the revolver to protect myself—I was in the habit of carrying 6,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 7,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. about me, and jewellery—I was afraid of being robbed, that was the reason I carried the revolver, no other reason. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell Mr. Pollard, in connection with that meeting with Sawyer at the empty house, that you had made up a parcel of old newspapers and a cashbox; that as you were leaving your house with your companions</p>

Prior to my meeting Druscovich in April, I thought it very desirable to have him in my pay—at that time Meiklejohn had intimated to me that Druscovich was rather a difficult person to approach—prior to April, 1876, I had never spoken to Drus<lb/>covich—I knew the position that he filled at Scotland Yard, and that he had been in the service a number of years, and that he was a foreigner Benson was never present at any interview that I had with Druscovich—I remember an occasion when I and Benson and Meiklejohn were in a cab together, after the 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. loan—Meiklejohn asked Benson if he knew how Druscovich had been <hi rend="italic">squared</hi>—Meiklejohn said he did not know I can't remember whether Meiklejohn said that one Sunday evening, early in the spring of that year, while he and I were at a public-house, a message was sent to him that he was wanted immediately—I am inclined to think it was said—it is scarcely correct to say that he said—when he got home he found Druscovich—he said that he went home and a message was left, and he came out to meet me, and Druscovich called in the meantime, and Druscovich was sent over to him; it is almost to the same effect, but not exactly as you put it—he did not say he had found Druscovich at his house—he said that Druscovich was in great dis<lb/>tress, and that he wanted 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or he was a ruined man—that Druscovich bad told him that he had backed a bill for his brother—he did not say that he said to Druscovich "I have got the very man; I have just left him"—he told Benson something to the effect that he had replied "Heis a friend of mine, and is an owner of racehorses, and a perfect gentleman, who will lend the money"—of course I might miss a word here and there in the jolting of the cab; the substance of it is correct—the first interview I had with Druscovich was on the 9th April, in Fentiman Road; the second was on the 10th August, at the Oriental Restaurant—that is the empty house—the next was on 13th April, at Ascot—I spoke to him there, but nothing in reference to this matter—the next was at the Swan at Stock well; the only date I can give you for that was about three days after his return from Jersey, in August—to the best of my belief it was the latter end of August—it was the day of the date of the letter that I received from Meiklejohn, that will fix the date—it may have been in September—it was earlier than September 20th—the next occasion was on the 25th, at the Northumberland Hotel; the next was on the 26th, under the arch in Craven Street, Strand; the next was the 27th, at the Midland Hotel, that was when he came up from Derby—I had gone down to Derby on the morning of the 27th—Benson came back that night—I had left at eight, and came back by the 5.10—the next occasion was on the 30th, first at the Kentish Town platform, and then at the public-house—the next, I think, was on 16th November, in the South Lambeth Road, not far from where he lives—the next time was at Dick's Hotel, on 31st October—that was before the other—the next was on 1st November, at the Northum<lb/>berland Hotel—I have omitted one interview, on 23rd of October, at New<lb/>market—the next was 5th November, at Edinburgh—then comes the 16th or 17th November, in the South Lambeth Road—I do not recollect any other meeting—when before the magistrate I did not say that prior to</p>

O. U. or a promissory note, but I never suggested any kind—when before the magistrate I did not say one word about asking Meikle<lb/>john at the Ludgate Hill Restaurant, "What did Druscovieh say?"—I did not say before the magistrate that Meiklejohn told me that Drus<lb/>covich had said to him that he was afraid of walking down with "Bill" for fear of "Old Clarke"—I did not say that Meiklejohn had told me that he thereupon said to Druscovich "Don't be a b——fool; Bill has got them all right at our place and in the City too"—I did not say one word about having said to Meiklejohn "I did not want you to tell him about Bailey," and that thereupon Meiklejohn had said "Oh, it don't matter a d——"—I was not in the habit of using the Swan public-house prior to meeting Druscovich there at the latter end of August or the begin<lb/>ning of Sept. 1876—I suppose I may have been there twice or three times before—I should say that I had not driven there in my gig with my man Goldie onmore than three occasions—I did notknow the landlord—I used the public parlour, the door of which is perhaps three yards from the bar—when Druscovich and I met at the Swan we had something to drink—I do not think it was champagne—I do not recollect what it was—a waiter served us—I think that waiter had been there on the former occasions when I went to the Swan—I went there before to be introduced by Meiklejohn to Jebb and Godwin, the postmen—with regard to that interview I did not say, when before the magistrate, one word about Druscovich saying to me "I will write to you in such a way that no one will understand but you and I," and that it was to be in the name of Montgomery—it was on the 26th of September that I received the letter from Druscovich—I could not identify a telegram in the writing of Druscovich shown to me the other day—I have never seen Drus<lb/>covich write—at the time I received the letter I did not wish to get Druscovich in my power—I wanted to get him into my pay, to give me information—there is not much difference in the words—I did not keep his letter because he said "Bring this with you"—I did not copy it, because I had no wish to do so—I met Druscovich in North<lb/>umberland Avenue the same morning the letter came—our letters crossed, making the same appointment—I was not then in my gig—I met him before, on the 25th, when I was in my gig; Street was with me—it was not Bale, I am quite sure it was Street—it was about four on the 25th when I met him, and exactly ten on the morning of the 26th—I remem<lb/>ber the clock striking as he came up—I do not recollect whether in my information I swore that Bale was with me in the gig—it was not so—it ""as Street—I do not think I mentioned when before the magistrate in</p>

Clarke, of the Crown Brewery—I do not know the name of the house Mr. Wiggins put up at; it was in Esher—I believe I have seen Griffin and Rowe at Esher, but I do not know that I have seen them together—the place is on the high road—there was only one meeting a month at Sandown in 1876, about eight meetings, perhaps; they all lasted two but none of them "' three days—there was a meeting on 31st Aug., 1876, but I did not go to it at all—I mean to tell the jurv that Rowe, Griffin, George Clarke, and Wiggins joined with Inspector Clarke at my suggestion to commit perjury about having seen me at Sandown Park, and from written instructions which I sent out through my solicitor, but Mr. Griffin may have made a mistake—I do not know that he committed perjury, but he swore wrong—I concocted this <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi> on the Sunday previous'Jo the false evidence being given—I had discovered that the meeting was really on the same day that</p>

I lived in Marquess Road about three years—I had a liouse there, and lived there with my wife—I had a seven years' agreement—it is correct what I said before the magistrate, that I first knew Mr. Froggatt the night following Benson's arrest, that up to that time he was not in any way connected with me and my asso<lb/>ciates, nor has he been connected directly or indirectly with my guilty intimacy with the police—I sent Murray to Mr. Froggatt, seeing his name in the papers as a criminal solicitor—he was to endeavour to recover the two bank notes that Venables, the money-changers, had kept—he was to sue Venables for them—I told Murray to say that he Lad attempted to cash the notes, and they were detained, and Mr. Froggatt was to do his best as a solicitor to recover them; to issue a writ, in fact Mr. Fr ggatt proposed that he should serve both Mr. Venables and Mr. Ahrahimis with a writ to try the question as to whether the notes were illegally detained or not—Murray was then going in the name of Wtlls—I know that Murray deceived Mr. Froggatt about some English bank notes—I know that he told Mr. Froggatt many lies in connection with these bank notes—it was about the 23rd November that I sent Murray to Mr. Froggatt—Murray was taken into custody on the 27th—the first day I saw Mr. Froggatt was the 4th December—he was with Meiklejohn—I think it was between six and seven o'clock—I cannot fix it nearer then about half-past six—I should say it was nearer half-past six than seven—I am speaking of the meeting at the corner of Southampton Row—lean show you how the exact time can be fixed, because it was ten minutes before the time the telegram was sent—I will undertake to swear that it was on the 4th December I saw Meiklejohn—I knew that Mr. Frogatt was not instructed to defend the men at Rotterdam at that time—Mr. Froggatt wrote the draft of the telegram on a piece of paper which he produced from his pocket; I swear that—I have said before that I did not know whether he took it from a pocket-book or not—I recollect that he took it from his pocket—I do not know whether it was the fly-sheet of a letter, or what; I know he took it from his pocket—I did not write to Mr. Ab ahams personally, it was through Stenning—it was perhaps about seven or eight days after I wrote these letters, through Stennidg, thai Mr. Sawyer saw me—I always represented to Mr. Froggatt that Flintofi was a truthful witness—I have told him that Flintoff exaggerated—when I was in the House of Detention I gave Mr. Froggatt, as my solicitor, certain instructions—with the exception of Flintoff's exaggeration I always told Mr. Froggatt he was a truthful witness—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my hand-writing—I gave him those instructions when I was in the House of Detention—I posted them to him; I am sure of that—these are the instructions I gave: "In reference to Flintoff, will it be wise to cross-examine him now as to who got him to make his statement, which is so diametrically opposite to the one made to the detectives who called on him, wherein he states that he did not know Brooks or Kurr?"

Humphreys and Son—I was in communication with them and their clerks for some weeks—I gave them false instructions—I have said that Mr. Froggatt told me he had given 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the Governor of Rotterdam gaol—I do do not know that that was to provide better food, and that a balance was returned by the governor to the police officer—he said he had given the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to supply better food—I know that a French directory was left at the lodgings—I can't say whether any clothes were left; I did not take the clothes—they were lelt at my stables by Mr. Froggatt—it is not true that I was ill in bed on 31st August—I believe the 4th December was a muggy sort of evening—I first gave information to the Treasury on 1st May.</p>

This (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the draft of the telegram that was concocted in the street on 4th December—the interview between myself and Mr. Froggatt in the street took place about ten minutes before the telegram was dispatched—I was not then aware that Mr. Froggatt Bad sent a telegram to Rotterdam to say that he was instructed to defend Benson—I had not given him any such instructions—I. had never seen him before—he produced the draft of the telegram from his pocket—I can<lb/>not recollect whether he got it out of a letter or a pocket-book—these in<lb/>structions to Holicitor were sent out by me about 7th to 10th, January—I had frequently seen Mr. Froggatt before those instructions were sent out—there was something written in the postscript, I can't say what it was; it is erased; not that I erased it, the erasure is not mine—the name Dr. Gordon Smith, and the other name, are not my writing, and were not on the paper at the time I sent it out—I don't know whose writing it is—when I left the Bridge of Allan I went to Derby, leaving Benson at Leicester—Street came to London in the train with me—I got out at Keutish Town, and took a hansom to a public-house opposite Clerkenwell police court—Street there got out of the cab, and I saw him speak to Palmer for a few moments; he then called me, and I went and joined him and Palmer—Street said to me in Palmer's presence "What about the letter at the Bridge of Allan?"—I said "All right, I will <hi rend="italic">give it to</hi> Street"—I believe Palmer heard me say that—he said "All right"—the idea of the <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi> that was concocted at my trial; it first occurred to me on the Sunday—Clarke was examined on Monday, the 16th—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are the instructions I gave to the solicitor's clerk; his name is Coppin, a clerk of Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am 30 years of age—Iwas born and educated in Paris—in 1872 I was convicted of forging a receipt for 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and sentenced to a year's imprisonment—during the time I was in prison I set fire to my bed clothes, and Mas so severely injured by the fire that I came out of prison a cripple, and assumed the name of G. H. Yonge—on the 26th or 27th February, 187-1, I made the acquaintance of William Kurr, by means of an advertisement which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraph</hi>—it was an advertisement of his stating that the party advertising required an editor or correspondent of a newspaper to write certain articles on given subjects—I answered that advertisement, and so came into com<lb/>munication with Kurr—in July or August, 1874, I became associated with him. in a betting fraud that went by the name of Archer—Street and Bale—were associated with us in it—after the Archer and Co. fraud had been broken up, I became acquainted with Walters in October, 1874, and in the autumn of that year joined him and Kurr in establishing another fraud, "Insurance against Turf Losses"—the title in French is "Le Societe Generale contre pnrte"—that lasted about six weeks—there were two offices, one at 25, Moorgate Street, the other at 160 or 161, Gresham House—I never went to these offices myself—it was not a profitable scheme, and was broken up at the end of the year 1874—after that I went to live at Rose Bank, Shanklin, Isle of Wight—I think it was the 16th of January when I went to live there—my housekeeper at Rose Bank was a Mrs. Avis—while I was living at Rose Bank I heard of the arrest of Walters and Murray—Kurr was string with me at the time—he was then going by the name of Medway—I was constantly in communication with Kurr, both before and at the time of Walters' and Murray's arrest—he was implicated in the Walters and Murray fraud, and there was a warrant out against him—he altered his name a little later on, and took that of Gifford—I first communicated with Clarke by means of Mr. Andrews, on the 11th of April, 1875, and in consequence of that communication Clarke came down to the Isle of Wight to see me on the 12th of April, 1875—he arrived at my house between five and six in the evening—we had along interview, four hours—I think he had some whisky and water, I am not sure—I told him my object in asking him to come and see me was to give certain information concerning the turf fraud, the "Insurances against loss," the one Walters and Murray had been arrested for, but that the information I had to give amounted to very little—he stated that he would have come down to have seen me, had he not received my message, inasmuch as he had received from one source anyhow, but he mentioned other sources, certain communications stating that I could give' if I chose certain information respecting this turf fraud—I told him that' the part I had taken amounted simply to the translation of the prospectus, and also to discounting a cheque or draft through my bankers for Murray; no, for Walters, not for Murray, because Murray I did not know—he asked me if that was all—I said "Yes"—I said I should feel very much annoyed if I had to appear as a witness in court, for two reasons: firstly, because I knew so very little; and secondly, that I was a cripple—I said knew very little of Walters, but the little that I did know was not very much in Walters' favour—that from what I had been told from Walters it appeared that Clarke had, so Walters said, been bribed by him, Walters, and that Walters went so far as to say that he had in his possession</p>

               <p>letters of Clarke, one especially winch he had photographed—Clarke said that he knew all about it; that letter which had been photographed was one relating to an appointment Clarke had made with Walters, for the purpose of Walters giving him information concerning a burglary which Lad been committed at a place called Stannard's Mill, I think—I told him that the construction Waiters put upon that letter was very different to the explanation he, Clarke, had just given, that Walters stated that that letter had been written for the purpose of making an appointment with him for quite different purposes, and that Walters, moreover, had positively told me that he, Clarke, had received 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Walters after getting a publican's licence for Walters, and stating that nothing was known against him, Walters, when, in reality there had been a previous conviction—Clarke said he would not have been such a fool as to have taken any money from Walters, or to have said that there was notning known against a man when there really was—he denied ever having received a single farthing from Walters—he asked me what construction Walters put upon the letter, and I told him—I told him one of the purposes was that a warrant was out for Walters at the time, so Walters said Clarke had written to him to meet him in order that he might give him the information about the warrant—Clarke asked me where the letter was, and I told him I did not know at the time, that Kurr knew—he asked me who and what Kurr was—he told me that he had a public-house, or was interested in one—I told him that he was one of Walters's dupes—that Kurr was more sinned against than sinning, and although there was a warrant against him I did not think that he was deserving of being arrested—Clarke said that from what he himself had seen he could not find out what part Kurr had taken in the matter—the next morning Clarke asked me what evidence there could be—but during our four hours' interview in the evening I asked him if he would keep me out of the witness-box, and I said that if he would I should be most happy to place a sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at his disposal—he said that if what I had told him was correct there would be no difficulty whatever in keeping me away, inasmuch as I knew very little, and he could make a report according to what I had told him—I asked him to allow me to make the report myself, and I began dictating, when he interrupted me, and said "You had better leave it to me, I shall be better able to do it than you; I shall say I found you lying prostrate, and the information you had to give was insignificant, and you will hear no more of it"—he passed over my offer of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., took no notice of it whatever—I made an appointment the next morning for breakfast—he did not sleep at my house, but came the next morning and breakfasted with me—dnring breakfast I told him that I would find out for him where that letter was, and that if Kurr had it I would make it my business that the letter should be returned to him—I had previously wrapped 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold in paper, and I offered him this small parcel—he took it, and said "What is this?"—I said "Simply 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he pushed it back, and refused it, and said "No, I will take no money"—I said I should consider myself in his debt, and that if he kept me out of the witness-box I should certainly consider that I owed him a sum of money—I afterwards wrote a draft letter to Clarke, and handed the draft to my housekeeper to copy—she copied it, and it was afterwards sent by post to Clarke—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced). (Read</hi>: "Scotland Yard, "April 19th, 1875. Dear Sir,—In reply to yours of the 11th inst., I am utterly astonished that you, a stranger, should have heard anything</p>

It is quite impossible for me to see you at the Isle of Wight. Yours respectfully, G. Clarke.") That refers to a letter I had written to Clarke on the 13th April, which referred to a statement by Walters that Clarke had written to Walters, and also telling Clarke that reports had been set afloat by Walters concerning himself, to the effect that Clarke had been bribed by Walters—that is what I recollect of the letter—I also received this letter. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Detective Office, April 26th, Dear Sir,—Your letter of the 19th only reached me yesterday, having been absent from London. You must have misunderstood me when at Rose Bank, as I certainly said that my visit was purely official, and that I could not enter into any confidential correspondence respecting the two men walters and Murray, but I did express my astonishment when you told me that the secrets of the office were betrayed by some one, whose name you decline to give. I further said that I should be glad to hear from you on that subject. I am still prepared and anxious to hear on that matter.—Yours respectfully, Gr. Clarke.") I had written a letter to Clarke on the 19th, in which I expressed my astonish<lb/>ment at having received his first letter, dated the 19th, and stared that he must have misunderstood me; that I wanted to remain a stranger to the whole case, and that I wanted Kurr likewise to be kept out of the matter if possible; that I also wanted information, but only information con<lb/>cerning myself, but that I was really astonished at the tone of the letter he had addressed to me.—shortly afterwards I had an interview with Clarke at Shanklin, and still later in London—T wrote a letter, which was sent to Clarke on the loth June—this is a copy: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "15th June, My Dear Sir and Brother,—We exchanged promises at our last interview.

I have also news of great importance to communicate to you about the letter you know. of. I will show you how thoroughly you can trust me. Will you, therefore, oblige me by coining down as soon as possible—Thursday or Friday? By leaving Waterloo at 8 p.m. you can return next morning in time to be in your office by 10. A line from you in return announcing your visit as requested will oblige yours sincerely, G. H. Y. If you do not like to write, merely let me know what time I may expect you, as it is urgent I should see you before Saturday.") I also received this letter: (<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: "20, Great College Street, Westminster, June 16th, 1875. No doubt you have heard that the two men, Walters and Murray, did not appear to take their trial and have not been heard of since. I hear they have left the country. I should be glad to see you to talk over the matter, but I cannot spare the time this week. I feel that I want a run out somewhere for a blow. Kurr and Montague have also left the country.—Yours truly, G. Clarke.") I also wrote on 17th June, 1375:" My Dear <hi rend="italic">Sir</hi>,—Many thanks for your kind letter, but I write to ask you to beg you to come down this week—firstly, because I am anxious to pay my debt towards Mrs. Clarke; secondly, because I know you will have</p>

Anyhow I should like to see you when at the Masonic, and I am sure you will be satisfied with my friendship and reliability.—Yours sincerely, G. H. Y." Clarke afterwards came to Shanklin about the 22nd or 23rd Jure—before he came I received this letter: "20, Great College Street, Westminster, June 18, 1875. Dear Sir,—Yours to hand, I cannot leave this week, but will endeavour to see you on Tuesday. Why don't you write more particulars?" I believe I also received a telegram—I also wrote this letter: "20th June, 1875. My Dear Sir,—I expect you on Tuesday and reserve all particulars till then. The best train you can take is one leaving Waterloo at 2.10, not 2.15, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Stokes Bay. If you wish to do so you can return to London the same evening. Hope to have the pleasure of seeing you on Tuesday. certain.—Yours sincerely, G. H. Y."—Clarke came down earlier than I expected—I think about 1.30, but I am not quite certain—he said Waiters and Murray had absconded from their bail, and I asked him <hi rend="italic">how</hi> far Kurr was compromised in the matter, and he said that so long as Kurr remained out of the way he did not think that anything would occur to him—he said he was under the impression that Kurr had left the country—I told him that he had not left the country—I asked him if he had heard where Walters was—he said he was under, the impression that he had heard that he was in Havre—I gave Clarke and he took 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, which I had got from the Hampshire Banking Company through a Mr. Frank Cooper of Shanklin, who changed either my cheque or a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I apologised for not giving him the full amount that I had promised, and stated "It was impossible in a small place like this"—meaning Shanklin—"to get a large sum in gold at a small branch," but inasmuch as I should most likely have a letter to return to him the fol<lb/>lowing week, I should be only too glad to return it if Kurr, in whose hands I understood it was, would let me, and that I should also give him the additional 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I considered I owed him—I asked Clarke to let me know whatever took place either concerning myself or Kurr, and I promised likewise to let him know if anything took place which con<lb/>cerned him—he said he would not let me know unless something very material took place concerning me, but I was to consider the matter at an end, and if anything did take place concerning myself or Kurr he would let me know—I have not kept all the letters I received from Clarke—he wished me to return them, and I did—this is the draft of a letter I wrote and sent to Clarke. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "June 24th, 1875. Dear Friend,—According to promise I write a few lines to warn you not to trust the two men whose names are Mitchell and Wood. I am given to understand they are both creatures of Walters', and would very much like to compromise you. They know nothing about you, except what that lying villain has told them, and in the event of their trying to approach you, you can tell them without fear that if they dare propose anything to you you will have them arrested. The letter you wrote to Walters is not in their hands, but in the hands of K., and it is as safe with him as with you. When all the affair is blown over he will restore it to you himself, and<lb/>I well know he will be happy, through me, to give you every satisfaction. It</p>

Please return this letter to me. If you wish to ask any questions pray do so without fear, as I have pledged myself to answer them, and return your letter by the next post.—Ever yours faithfully, G.

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "George Clarke, Esq., 20, Great College Street, Westminster, London, S.W.") I saw Clarke again a week or 10 days after the interview of the 23rd, at all events before the 4th July, at Shanklin, at my house, when I gave him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes—I apologised for giving him notes, and told him that as he had not given me any notice when he was coming down I had no alternative but to give him Bank of England notes—he said "Nevermind," and he then asked me for the letter—I told him Kurr bad it—he said "Where is Kurr?"—I said "He is in the house; will you see him?"—he was not in the house, but Mr. Clarke said immediately "No, I will not see him, if I see him I should arrest him"—he said "Why will you not give me that letter back?"—I said "Kurr will not give it to me; he will only give it up himself"—I pressed him to see Kurr—he refused—I got these notes from the Hampshire Banking Company—they were of small denomination', such as 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I afterwards received this letter: (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "20, Great College Street, Westminster, 12th August, 1875. Dear Sir,—Shall be glad to hear if you are likely to be at home on Saturday, as I expect to be in your neighbourhood, and may give you a call—Yours truly, G. Clarke.") I also received these tele<lb/>grams: "16th August, 1875, from G. Clarke, 20, Great College Street, to Mr. Yonge, Rose Bank, Shankhm. Can be with you by 11 o'clock, if that will do," and "August 16, 1875, from G. Clarke, Ryde, to Mr. Yonge, Rose Bank, Shankin. Rail late. Shall leave here about 12." I saw Clarke that day, the 16th—he referred to the letter; it was principally for the letter that he had come down, and he asked me where Kurr was—I told him that Kurr and myself were going abroad on that day, and that Kurr had promised me that he would return the letter to Clarke himself, but to him only—I asked Clarke if he thought the time had not come when he might see Kurr without any danger to himself—he said no; he preferred not seeing him yet—he asked me if there was any fear of the letter being shown, and I said no—Kurr and I went to Switzerland on the 16th—my servant, William Picard; went with us—we were absent a fortnight—I passed abroad by my own name, Yonge; Kurr went by the name of Gifford—on returning to London I drove to 20, College Street—I had made an appointment with Clarke by telegram from Dover I think, or by letter—my servant got down to knock at the door, but before he could do so Mr. Clarke came out—I asked him to get into the cab, and he did so—I did not drive him far before he got down, but in the cab I asked him what had better be done for Kurr—I asked him first whether he thought the matter was completely over at the Treasury, and that if Kurr did show himself in London would he be arrested—he said he did not know, but he advised that a letter should be sent by Kurr to the Treasury, stat<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>that he, Kurr, was very much surprised that a warrant should have been issued against him, and that he was here in London prepared to meet any charge that could be brought against him—that would be on the 30th August, between twelve and one o'clock—an appointment was made for the same evening at the Langham Hotel—I then went to the Langham, where Kurr had secured rooms for me, but Kurr went to his house to live—Clarke came about 8 p.m., or a little later—Kurr was in the bedroom—Clarke did not know that—I asked Clarke if he knew Kurr had sent the letter Clarke had advised me Kurr should send—it had been sent—Clarke said he knew a letter had been sent, but he did not know what steps would be taken, or what the Treasury would do—I asked him how long it would be before he would know—he said perhaps he would know the next morning, but he considered the matter was virtually at an end, and that nothing further would be heard of it—I said if the answer from the Treasury was favourable to Kurr, I supposed that he, Clarke, would have no objection to see Kurr—he said "None whatever"—I said "Then of course Kurr would return the letter"—I asked him to make a further appointment with me when I could see him—he said he would let me know as soon as the Treasury had decided what they would do—on that same day, the 30th August, I saw Meiklejohn for the first time, in my bedroom, at the Langham Hotel, at 11.30—Kurr introduced him and me to him by my nickname of Poodle—I told Meiklejohn what I had done during the day with Clarke, that Kurr had written a letter, and that I hoped the matter would be completely at an end—Meiklejohn told me how he became acquainted with Kurr—I saw Clarke twice again, once the same or the following week, at the Langham Hotel, when he told me what had taken place, that the matter was closed—I then asked him if he would see Kurr, and he said he would see him—I forget when the letter was given up—it was between the second and third time that I saw Clarke—Kurr was present on the second occasion. (<hi rend="italic">Inspector Clarke's report, dated 30th August, was here put in, enclosing a letter from Wm.

About the time of the interview with Clarke at the Langham Hotel, there was a vacancy in. the police force, caused by the death of one of the inspectors; In<lb/>spector Davey, I think—Meiklejohn wrote to me about that—I have not got the letter—it was destroyed—I have not seen it for the last two years—I do not know that I should like to say that I saw it destroyed—I last saw it amongst my other papers at my house in Shanklin—I left a number of letters there, and they were destroyed—the person who destroyed them wrote to me, and told me they were destroyed—I gave directions for the letters to be destroyed after I left Shanklin and before my arrest—I did not go to my house afterwards—sometime in September, during a visit to London, when I stayed at the "Westminster Palace Hotel, I told Meiklejohn that I had failed with Inspector Clarke, and that I had nut been able to do what he had requested me—after re<lb/>receiving Meiklejolm's letter I had written to Clarke—in August or Sep<lb/>tember, 1875, I had another interview with Clarke, at the Westminster Mace Hotel—the subject of that interview was that certain inquiries</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220124"/>
               <p>had been made about me from Shanklin, and that the inquiry had been lodged in his hands—I asked him what the nature of the inquiry was and he told me that Inspector Druseovich had been sent to the French Embassy to make certain inquiries, and that the reply which he had re<lb/>received was that I was not known—I asked him to tell the inquirer that it would be better for his curiosity not to go too far—I told him that I wished the inquiry to be stopped entirely, as it was giving me a great deal of annoyance—he said that he would do his best, but that he did not intend to compromise himself—Clarke at that time did not know my real name;—he asked about it at this interview—he told me that it was strange that I should be on intimate terms with a man like Kurr—at the first interview he had shown me a letter stating that Yonge was not my name—he then pressed me at this interview to give him my name—I drew out a pocket handkerchief which I had in my pocket and showed it to him—it had a coronet on it—I asked him if he knew what that was, and he said "Yes, it is a princely coronet"—he asked me what the initials stood for, and I told him for the name of Murat—the initial were "G. M."—I saw Clarke again by appointment either in January or February, 1876, at No. 3, Bentinck Street, Cavendish Square—I asked him if he had seen Murray, the man who had absconded from his bail—he said no, he had not seen him, but he knew he was back, and he was informed that Walters was back too—I said so far as Walters was concerned I did not believe he was back, but that I knew Murray had returned—I said that both Kurr and myself <hi rend="italic">were</hi> anxious that the whole affair should not be revived or reopened, and that if Murray was arrested naturally all the proceedings would have to be gone through again, could he suggest any means with<lb/>out injuring Murray, whereby Murray should be so much frightened that he should either leave the country or not be seen about—after some little discussion, Clarke said he would insert a notice in the <hi rend="italic">Police Gazette</hi> to the effect that information was required concerning Murray and Walters, and if any information reached, it was to be immediately for<lb/>warded to Chief Inspector Clarke, Scotland Yard—by that means nobody could arrest or do anything until Clarke had given the order—that notice was afterwards inserted.

I saw Meiklejohn in June, 1876, at Nelson's Great Portland Hotel, where I was staying—I told him that 1 had received a letter from Kurr that morning, and that Kurr would not be present at the interview—I asked him whether it was true that a man of the name of Colettso, who had been arrested some time before, had offered him 10,000 dollars to let him free, and whether he would have taken 10,000 dollars if he had given them to him—Meiklejohn said that</p>

               <p>he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> not offered them to him, that if he had had them he would not have taken them, if he had given him ten times 10,000 dollars he would have arrested him—I asked him what had become of all Colettso's papers he told me they were at Colettso's lodgings, in Pimlico, but that Mr. George Lewis, who had the case in hand, had applied for them to be given up—I asked Meiklejohn if he had seen any of the papers, and he said yes; that there were books and scrip of the Bastrop Coal Company, and cheques on almost all the banks in London—I asked how was it possible that he should have had so many cheques when to my certain knowledge the man had no money—he said he did not know, but that tie cheques were there, and he had gut a number of them in his possession—I told him that it was my intention to go to Egypt, and that if he could give me a number of Bastrop Coal Company scrip in blank; and also a number of those cheques just named, I should feel much obliged to him Meiklejohn said he would do so—subsequently I received from Meikle<lb/>john two blank scrip of the Bastrop Coal Company, and a number of blank cheques on the London and Westminster Bank, Temple-bar branch, and on the London and County Bank, head office, Lombard Street—all these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are documents I received from Meiklejohn a fortnight afterwards at the Langham Hotel—the writing was not upon them then; they were in blank—I asked him how Colettso had been apprehended—I spoke of Colettso at first by the name of Gray, which was his correct name—he said he had two friends in the post-office in tie district in which Colettso lived; that he had obtained a clue to Colettso's whereabouts by opening either a letter which was addressed to Colettso or written by Colettso (I do not know which), and which con<lb/>tained Colettso's address—he said that he had promised these two friends of his a sum of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which was to be payable out of a reward which kd been offered for Colettso's apprehension by the American Govern<lb/>ment; that he was very much afraid the reward would not be paid, as Colettso was to be brought up before the judge in chambers the follow<lb/>ing Thursday and discharged, owing to some difficulty which had arisen on the Extradition Treaty—he did not give the names of his two friends—my servant, Pierre Pionchon, came into my service on the 30th September, 1875—he succeeded Picard; not then, but ultimately—I went to Biarritz with Pionchon on the 9th July, 1876—I returned by way of Paris, where I was on the 18th July—I stayed at the Hotel Vieullemont, in the name of the Count de Montague—this is my hotel bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I stayed there until the evening of the 22nd—on Thursday morning, the 21st, Kurr and Bale arrived in Paris, and stayed at the same hotel—we all three came back together to Cannon Street station—when we got there we met Meiklejohn by appointment—we went to the Cannon Street Hotel and engaged a private room—we all dined together—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is the bill of the dinner—Meiklejohn, Kurr, Bale, and myself were present—we talked about a scheme we intended carrying out and which was ul<lb/>timately carried out—Gurney of London, and Barrett of Dover where the names—I stayed at Kurr's house that night—the scheme was to be carried out in London and in Dover—it was a fraud, but not of the same nature—I stayed at Kurr's house that night until the follow<lb/>ing Wednesday, when I went to Dover—I stayed at Dover until the fol<lb/>lowing Thursday week—I had Bale with me at Dover—on leaving Dover I went to No. 28, Grosvenor Road—the landlady's name was Mrs. Bruce—</p>

               <p>I stayed there a week, from the 3rd of August to the 10th—the De Go court fraud was concocted in the cab on my return from Dover on the night of the 3rd of August—Kurr, myself, Bale, and Savory—we kept a book later on in which we made all the entries in respect to the De Gon court fraud—this is the book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a petty cash account and also an account of the names of the parties who went money—it is not an account of all the disbursements, but I believe of all the receipts—the receipts are at one end of the book and the cash disbursements at the other—the whole of the expenses are not entered, only the petty cash expenses—I saw Meiklejohn on the 4th, 6th, and 8th of August—I saw him on the 4th of August at his own house in the South Lambeth Road—I went with Kurr and saw him in Kurr's presence—the conversation was about the Dover scheme, which had failed—I asked him to dine with me the next evening, the 5th, he said he would, to explain to him the scheme which we intended working I told him I would go into full par<lb/>ticulars at the dinner—the dinner was on the next day, the 5th; it was Saturday—on the Saturday I received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know the handwriting—I know by whom it was written—what I mean is this, that my knowledge of the handwriting is not sufficient to enable me to swear that it is written by the party who has written it, but yet I know who wrote it—I heard it from Mrs. Meiklejohn, and he told me afterwards she had written it—the letter is "My dear Sir,—My husband won't be able to be with you this evening as he has an appointment he is obliged to keep." The letter is dated Saturday, and I saw him the next day, Sunday—I saw him at his house—Kurr was with me—I told him I was exceedingly disappointed at not having seen him at dinner the night before, and I said before proceeding to business I wished to make a short statement to him concerning the former scheme; it had been a failure, as he knew, but that as he had been put to some slight expense for cab fares and telegrams, I requested his acceptance of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I handed to him—I said I should have been pleased if it could have been more, but we had been placed at great expense, and instead of being gainers we were losers; at the same time I told him that we were now on the point of starting a fresh scheme, which we hoped, in fact we <hi rend="italic">felt</hi> certain, would more than recoup our losses and would prove satisfactory, I hoped, to him—he asked me what it was, and I was on the point of telling him what it was when Kurr interrupted me and said "It is useless to explain; you know what it is, Jack? it is what is called the medley scheme"—he said yes, but in a thousand years he would not understand it; he knew all about it, but he could not understand it—he then said "You will find that two postmen (he named them) will be very handy in this"—"Don't you think," he said, turning to Kurr, "that you could afford something?"—Kurr said "Yes"—he gave me their names, Jebb and Godwin—he added "They were disappointed over the last; I promised them 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I should have given them; they did all they could for you in the Dover scheme, and it was not their fault that it was a failure"—Kurr said he had no objection whatever, but who was to give it them—Meiklejohn said he would—Kurr said "Would you have an objection to introduce me to them, I could then give it them myself?"—Meiklejohn said he would have no objection whatever—I believe at the beginning of the interview Kurr asked Meiklejohn whether he had made any appointment to see Drusco<lb/>vich—Meiklejohn said that he had received a telegram too late to act,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220127"/>
               <p>but that he had seen Druscovich before and that Druscovich. had remarked to him, "I don't know what Bill will think of me for my having stopped his little game at Dover," and that he (Meiklejohn) replied that he did not think that Kurr had anything whatever to do with the Dover fraud—I think it was at this interview also that Meiklejohn told us that Druscovich and Mr. Williamson had had some words, and that it ended in Mr. Williamson tendering an apology to Druscovich, that Druscovich had reported the matter to Captain Harris—he had alluded on the 4th to his going; to Derby, but on the 6th. I asked him whether he had heard any<lb/>thing definite about his appointment to the post of superintendent of the Midland Railway Police—lie said not yet, that only Inspector Shore and himself stood any chance of being selected for the post—I then urged him to leave the field entirely to Shore, and told him that he would be of a great deal more use to us in London than he would be in Derby—he said no, he could do a great deal more for us in Derby, because his position was independent, than he could at Scotland Yard—"Besides," he said, "you know I can always run up at any moment if I get the berth "—I asked him if it was a certainty that he would get the berth—he said he thought it was, because Inspector Shore wanted too many things—I told Meiklejohn I should be content with his refusal of my invitation on the previous day, but I should expect him to dine with me later on, and should leave him to name the day—he never dined with me while I was at Mrs. Bruce's—I saw him on the 3rd at his house—he simply read a letter which he had received from the post people, making an appoint<lb/>ment with him—I left Mrs. Bruce's on the 10th—I went to 55, Beresford Road, the landlady's name was Mrs. Ethel—this is Mrs. Bruce's bill—the order for the printing of the <hi rend="italic">Sport</hi> newspaper was given while I was at Mrs. Bruce's, I believe about the 5th—between the 5th and 10th, I believe—the orders for the circular and for the sham cheques were given a day or two later, about the 8th—the different apartments in the neighbour<lb/>hood of St. James's Street were taken a little later—I was at Mrs. Ethel's at the time—there were four or five different apartments taken—they were in different postmen's beats, but in the same district—in the south<lb/>west district—I did not arrange this—I was not told by any of the prisoners—Kurr told me—I saw Meiklejohn while I was at Mrs. Ethel's—it was on the 13th, that was the Sunday, I saw him at his house—Kurr was with me—on that occasion there was a knock at the front door—Kurr said, on hearing it, "That's the Contractor"—Mrs. Meiklejohn came in and told her husband that Inspector Druscovich was there, and Meiklejohn left the room—on his return Kurr asked him who it was, and he replied "The Contractor, Druscovich"—Kurr asked "Why did you not ask him to come in?"—Meiklejohn replied "You have frightened him away"—Kurr said "Is there any news?"—and he said "No"—he said "By-the-bye, I have received this letter," and he pulled out a letter torn his pocket, a letter from Jebb—the letter contained the hours at which Jebb and Godwin were at the post-office in the South-Western district—one would be there, it said, from five p.m. to one o'clock in the morning, and the other from one till eight at night—he told me who he writer of the letter was, and showed it to me—on that occasion I old Meiklejohn that I had changed my lodgings; and when I asked to dine with me, he appointed the following Saturday, the 19th, on which day he came—that dinner took place at Mrs. Ethel's,</p>

               <p>and there were present Kurr, Meiklejohn, and myself—Meiklejohn was about half-an-hour late, and he gave as a reason that he had been waiting for Sergeant Reimer's return from an expedition relative to the loss of the Gainsborough picture—he said that an anonymous letter had been received at Scotland Yard, or by Mr. Agnew, I forgot which, setting forth that if Mr. Agnew would come to an appointment near Hyde Park, with 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, the picture should be returned, and that Reimers was instructed to go there—that he had taken a black bag, and pat into it <hi rend="italic">two</hi> or three inkstands, and a brickbat or two, to make it appear bulky—I asked why Reimers was selected—he replied because his appearance was very much like Mr. Agnew's brother, but that at the time of his (Meiklejohn's) leaving Scotland Yard no news had transpired about the picture or about Reimers—I told him during the dinner that we expected the <hi rend="italic">Sport</hi> newspaper that evening, that Frederick Kurr was in Edinburgh, and that as soon as the newspapers arrived the letters would be posted—I asked him which would be the best way of posting the letters, whether they should all be posted in one district or divided—he said he advised that the letters should be posted about forty or fifty at one time, in order to avoid too great a bulk—he asked how many letters we had, and I told him about 200 or 300—among those letters was one to Madame de Goncourt—the letter produced I think was written by Bale—I prepared the French circular—the letter is dated, "London, August 20"—at the time there were a number of letters ready for posting, each envelope containing a French circular, and a newspaper was to be put in, but it had not yet arrived, nor did it arrive, before Meiklejohn left—Meiklejohn went away early inconsequence of the receipt of a telegram—he said he must go home immediately, as he had received a telegram from his wife, which no doubt related to the missing picture—before he left an ap<lb/>pointment was made to meet the next evening at his house—on the following evening I went to his house with Kurr—the letters had all been posted at that time—at that interview I first asked him "What about the missing picture?"—he said it was a hoax, that nothing had come of it—I then told him that all the letters were posted, and that now it was urgent that some steps should be taken for securing the different offices or rooms where the letters might be received, and Kurr and myself asked him to accompany us to see Jebb—he consented, a cab was sent for, or I believe the same cab, I am not quite certain, and we got into it and drove somewhere in the Wandsworth Road, I don't know where, when Meiklejohn and Kurr got out—whilst we <hi rend="italic">were</hi> in the cab Meiklejohn asked me if Kurr had ever told me how he had managed to get the Contractor right—I said "No," although he had—he said "It was in this wise; early in the spring I was one night with Kurr at some public-house when a message came from his house that he was wanted immediately, that he left Kurr and returned home, and found Druscovich, who seemed exceedingly an<lb/>noyed, and told him that he was in great difficulties, that he had backed a bill for his brother, and still required 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to complete the money which was due, and if it was not forthcoming the Sheriff's officer would be put in possession; and he asked him to lend him 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; that Meiklejohn said that he could not, but he had a friend who he had just left. who would be very pleased to lend him that sum, and if he liked he would run round to</p>

               <p>and I saw him on Sunday evening, 27th, at his house, 202 South Lambeth Road, and told him that I had received a number of replies and the cheques he gave me at the Langham Hotel were completely used' having been sent to our foreign correspondents, and I should feel "grateful if he would give me some more—this cheque of the South-Western Bank of August 26th, is filled up in Bale's writing—I received it in blank from Meiklejohn, and sent it to one of the persons who had answered the circulars—it was forwarded to a correspondent and returned by him to one of the fictitious bookmakers, and so came again into my possession—Meiklejohn said "You don't mean to say that you have used up all those cheques?"—I said "I have, and a great many more"—he said "I have no more to give you"—I said "The printer says he ordered a great many more of our own, but the printer has not kept his word, and they have not yet come to London"—when I said cheques of our own, I did not at that time tell Meiklejohn what cheques I referred to—I know Palmer—I drove with Kurr last August to the Strand; Kurr alighted, and was met by Palmer; the two passed the cab a few minutes later, and went somewhere else—I was left in the cab about a quarter of an hour—I cannot fix the date—I did not know Palmer at that time personally—I think that was the first time I had seen him—this is Mrs. Assy's lodging book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) with her account in it—the offices at 8, Northumberland Street were taken on 30th August by F. Kurr only, but were not occupied till the 31st, when the agreement was signed—I went there every day and secured the letters sent to Montgomery, and the letters sent to the bookmakers were brought there by F. Kurr and Bale—W. Kurr was present when those offices were taken on 31st—when we went into occupation he was there all day—we were all there on the 31st—I first saw Meiklejohn there on Saturday, 7th September—he said that everything was at an end; the police had wind of our dealings; detectives had been sent to Murray's lodgings, where the letters were received, and, in fact, the whole scheme had collapsed—he drew out a paper from his pocket when I stated that I did not believe his statement, and from it he read Montgomery's address, 11, King Street; Jacob Francis, 2, Cleveland <hi rend="italic">Row</hi>; Charles Jackson, 12, St. James' Place, and Thomas Ellerton, of Duke Street, I think—I said" There can be no doubt that the matter is correct, it is a great pity, it seems that ill-luck pursues us"—Kurr then winked at me, and I knew it was a hoax—I said to Meiklejohn "I know it is not true; if it had been true you would have been the first to have suffered"—Kurr then asked Meiklejohn if he had seen that morning's <hi rend="italic">Sport</hi>—he said "No," and we both went into the back office, and I took from a box I kept there one of the numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Sport</hi> newspaper, and brought it back into the room—I forget whether I gave it to Kurr or to Meiklejohn, but Meiklejohn took it, opened it, and on seeing Montgomery's name, he said "Oh, I have not got time for this <hi rend="italic">bosh</hi> now, I must take it; I will read it later on"—I said "Yes, if you promise no one shall see it"—he did so, and put it in his pocket—500 were printed at first, and afterwards 250, but no second newspaper was issued—he asked us if we were doing well—I said no—Kurr went out and fetched some champagne from the Northumberland Hotel I think—on Thursday or Friday, September 7th or 8th, I saw Palmer at the office—there 'was a tap at the window with an umbrella—Kurr and Bale were in the</p>

               <p>from William Kurr, letters and telegrams—I paid in the first notes on Friday, the 29th—I paid the money into two banks: one was the Tron gate branch of the Clydesdale Bank, and the other the Trongate branch of the City of Glasgow Bank—before I paid them in I received a letter from William Kurr on the 28th—I immediately went to the banks to open accounts—I also directed Bale and Frederick Kurr to open other accounts elsewhere in Glasgow—that was in consequence of the letter—I did not pay in all the money—I paid 5,900<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the Clydesdale Bank (Trongate branch), and 1,735<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into the City of Glasgow Bank—I kept the balance back—I did not pay in all the notes be<lb/>cause the greater portion of them had been stopped—I knew that from the letter I had received—I left Glasgow on Tuesday night 3rd October, on my return to London—before leaving I paid in on the Monday a further sum of 800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, which I ascertained had not been stopped, to the Clydesdale Banking Company, and on the Tuesday I paid in the bulk of the remainder, 5,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in stopped and 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Glasgow notes—that made up a sum of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., for which I obtained a draft on the Greenock branch of the Clydesdale Bank—I cashed that draft and got one hundred 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Clydesdale notes at the Greenock branch at twelve o'clock—Greenock is only an hour's ride by rail—I left for London the same night by the nine o'clock express—before leaving I telegraphed to William Kurr—I arrived at St. Pancras (Midlanu) station the following morning at eight o'clock—I took a four-wheel cab, and my servant took a hansom—my cab broke down at the corner of the Caledonian Road—my cabman called another cab, and I got into it; but first drove to the tele<lb/>graph station and telegraphed to Bale—the second cabman took me to my own door, 1.0, Newington Green Road, where my servant had just arrived—I saw Kurr that day about ten in the morning, and gave him a draft for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. drawn by the British Linen Company in favour of Mr. W. Medway, I think, on Messrs. Smith, Payne, and Co—I had purchased it from the British Linen Company, at Glasgow, and paid for it with three of the notes which I had obtained from the City of Glasgow Bank or the Clydesdale Bank—Kurr took away the draft with him, and after a time returned with 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold, in two small leather bags, and I counted out 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and placed it in one of the bags, and gave it back to him—I saw him the same day a third time about six o'clock, and a fourth time about half-past ten—I gave him the whole of the notes that I had brought with me—I left Mrs. Assy's on the morning of the 6th October, and went to Brighton with Kurr to the Ship Hotel—I remained until the following Monday week, 16th October—Kurr remained until Saturday, the 14th during the time we were at Brighton we twice made trips to London—the first was on Tuesday, the 10th—we drove from Victoria station to the corner of Great College Street—Kurr got out of the cab, and after being absent about half an hour he came back alone, and made a communica<lb/>tion to me—Kurr remained in London—I came up to London again on the 16th—I had an appointment with a solicitor, and I afterwards met Kurr and changed cabs, and drove to his house—I returned alone to Brighton on the same night—I left Brighton on the 16th; I went to Hastings, and on the following day came to London—I went to the Castle and Falcon in the name of Clifford, with my servant—I saw Meiklejohn that evening between seven and eight, at Kurr's house—I had shaved off my moustache and beard, and Meiklejohn stated that I looked like Mr.</p>

               <p>then drove to the Kentish Town station—the train arrived at 9.20 and Moiklejohn jumped out of one of the carriages—I asked Meiklejohn whether he could not secure a carriage to ourselves—he replied that he could not manage it—I stepped in first and he followed—as we were get<lb/>ting in Kurr handed to Meiklejohn the packet which he had shown to meat 29, Marquess Road, and Meiklejohn put it into his pocket—I do not know who else was in the carriage, but there was a gentleman a stranger to me—after wo had got some little distance he pulled it out and said "What has Bill given me?"—I replied "500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he opened the packet, and counted the notes on his knee in presence of the stranger—I asked him how he was going to get rid of them—he said there were one or two which he could manage through his brother—he also said he had a friend who had been to school with him, who was manager of the branch of the Clydesdale Bank at the Bridge of Allan—Meiklejohn said he would not have been so exacting had it not been for his family: that his boys were growing up, and that he wanted to give them a good education—that was my first visit to Derby—I said that I should go by the name of Clifford, of Melbourne—I had never been in Melbourne—I do not know whether Meiklejohn knew that—I went to the Midland Hotel, because he said the manager was one of his friends—I could not get a bedroom there—the only accommodation they could give me was making up a bed in the sitting-room—I stayed there that night—Meiklejohn came next morning to breakfast and showed me a letter from Wilson—I did not know Wilson personally, only by reputation—he is a sub-inspector of the detective police in Glasgow—after breakfast we went to Matlock and stayed at the New Bath Hotel—I went by the name of Clifford there—when I went on 20th Oct. from Derby to Matlock, Meikle<lb/>john went in the train with me—I got out at Matlock Bridge, and he went on—he said he was going to Manchester to make some inquiry con<lb/>cerning some outrage that had been committed on the Midland line—I went from Matlock to Derby on 21st Oct., and went to Meiklejohn's house—I asked him whether he had discovered anything about the outrage he said no—I then asked him what he had done in Manchester—he said that he had taken the opportunity of changing one of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes there—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of the Clydesdale notes—I asked with whom he had changed it—he said he did not know; some stranger—I asked him if there were any particulars asked by the money-changer, and what was the rate of exchange—he said when first he inquired about the charge they asked some exorbitant rate of exchange, but afterwards the man agreed to take less, and that the only inquiry made was his name and address—I asked what name ho had given; he replied that he had given some common name, I forget what it was, and the address somewhere in Piccadilly, St. James's Squaro or St. James's Place, I forget which—I told him I considered he had been extremely foolish in changing that note, especially in giving the address he had done, when he knew that the inquiries concerning the fraud would lead to St. James's Place or St. James's Square, in fact. Jackson had received letters there—Jackson was one of the fictitious bookmakers—he said there was no fear of anything arising, because the man was a perfect stranger to him, that he had seen him for the first time, and most likely would never see him again—at Derby Meiklejohn introduced me to Mr. Carr, the inspector of the railway police—I forget whether he introduced me under any name—I think he</p>

               <p>simply said "My friend"—I had before that written a letter to Wilson which I took with me and read to Meiklejohn, and I asked him to add a few lines to it or to write it himself, but he said it was perfectly unneces<lb/>sary to write after what I had done and said in my letter; that would be sufficient, that Wilson would be perfectly satisfied—I told Meiklejohn that I had forwarded 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Wilson, regretting that he should have been placed at any annoyance through the inquiries he had answered for me, and that I hoped he would not, as he had stated in his letter to Meikle <hi rend="italic">john</hi>, lose his situation, and that I hoped nothing more would be heard of the matter—I had promised Meiklejohn a case of champagne, and as I could not get it myself would he take the equivalent in money—he said yes, and I gave him five 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Scotch notes—I next went from Matlock to Derby on Monday, the 23rd, and saw Meiklejohn at the railway station on the platform and afterwards went to his office—he said "I had a letter from the Contractor this morning"—I asked what he said, and he gave me the letter to read—I read it and gave it him back, and said I considered it a very clever one—I remarked that I did not think the writer of that letter could be thoroughly trusted—he said "You may rely upon him as you would upon me, but he is not up to the case yet," or I not up to the mark," I forget which—there was no enclosure in that letter—I was to have seen Meiklejohn the following day, but he told me that he would have to go to Leeds that day, Tuesday, and I made an appointment with him on the Wednesday, the 25th—I saw him that day at the terminus at Derby, and afterwards at his office—on that occasion he showed me another letter, but before that he told me that on the Tuesday (the 24th) at Leeds he had cashed another 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note with a friend of his, a wine merchant, in Leeds—I said I thought it was a very foolish thing—he said that the gentleman with whom he had cashed it had kown him for seventeen years, and that therefore nothing would take place—after I had seen the letter I said I thought he had been exceedingly unwise and foolish to have changed a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note under those circumstances, especially after what the letter contained; no doubt there would be some serious consequences arising from it—he again replied that he did not think anything serious could arise, from the mere fact that the gentleman who had changed it had known him seventeen years, and in all probability no inquiries would be made on the subject at all—I said I did not think he had heard the last of it, and asked what was his hurry, especially after having changed a note on the Saturday—lie said he did not wish the money to lie idle—the letter he showed me had a printed paper enclosed, smilar to this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I saw Meiklejohn again on Friday, the 27th, at Derby—he told me that he had that morning received another letter from the Contractor—I asked him what the contents were—he did not show it me—he said that the Contractor had written to state that a letter had reached Scotland Yard from the chief or deputy-constable, to the effect that a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note had been changed in Leeds by Meiklejohn, and Druscovich wanted to know what reply was to be given—I told Meikle<lb/>john that I thought the matter was exceedingly serious; what explanation was he going to give—he said that the deputy or chief constable at Leeds I don't know which) was an intimate friend of his, and that he was going to write to him to tell him that his inspector was a fool, and that in the meanwhile nothing would come of the complaint at Scotland Yard, beause Druscovich had destroyed it and put it on the fire—I said I was</p>

               <p>still of opinion that the matter was exceedingly serious, and that we should hear what Kurr would say when he came down on the same afternoon—Meiklejohn still treated the matter very lightly—Kurr came to Derby, and Meiklejohn and myself met him on the platform—I told him in Meiklejohn's presence what had occurred, and Kurr took the same view of the matter as I did—he went back with me to Matlock that night—I asked Meiklejohn previously to make Kurr remain over that night as we had to talk of business matters, and it would take some time' longer in fact than could be managed in the time that Kurr would remain in Derby if he had to leave the same night; so it was agreed that we should meet next morning, Meiklejohn, myself, and Kurr, at Derby—we met again next day and went from Matlock to Derby—our interview took place, first at the office, afterwards we drove in a cab to Meiklejohn's house—there we talked about the advisability of starting another firm similar to that of Montgomery, and where the best locality would be—I first proposed to start in Liverpool, but Meiklejohn said no, it was not advisable—I said so far as Glasgow was concerned I thought it was rather too warm, after what had transpired, to go back there—he agreed with me—I asked him "What about Edinburgh; can you give me an introduction in Edinburgh?"—Meiklejohn said that he could give us an introduction, but that he did not think we required one, because Wilson was an intimate friend of a person, he did not mention the name at the time, in Edinburgh, who would do all we wanted. and, turning to Kurr, he said "You know who I mean"—Kurr said "Who do you mean? do you mean Gollan?"—he said "Yes, I do;" he said "He is in the Custom House—no, he is not; he is a sheriff's officer, and as sheriffs officer if anything were to take place you are bound to know it, because no warrant can be issued in Scotland until the sheriff or the fiscal has granted it ""But," said Kurr, "I do not know the man sufficiently myself, I have only seen him once at a racecourse; cannot you give us another introduction?" He said "The captain of the police in Edin<lb/>burgh is an old man of the name of Linton, but he seldom or ever comes to the office; in fact, I do not think he comes to the office more than once or twice a week. He leaves all his work to be done by his son, who is lieutenant of the police I might manage to give you an introduction to him, but I think." he said "you will find Wilson can manage it very much better than I can, but still I am quite ready to do so." Kurr then asked him whether he thought Edinburgh was the proper place to work—he said yes, he decidedly thought so—Kurr then pressed him to name a day when he would come down to meet Wilson and introduce him to Linton in person—Meiklejohn said that he would have to go to Edinburgh or to Glasgow; no, he would have to go to the north for some inquiry or for some arrangement in a very short time, in fact the next week, and if Kurr liked to make an appointment he would meet him and proceed with him as far as Edinburgh or Glasgow, and there the introduction should take place—it was afterwards agreed that on the following Thursday they should go down together, but they did not go down on the Thursday—Kurr returned to London on that evening—I went back to Matlock and stayed till the Monday next, the 30th—then I returned to London and. stayed at the Great Northern Hotel, under the name of Clifford, until Thursday night, 2nd November—while staying there I purchased a locket and necklet at Benson's, on Ludgate Hill—Kurr, who was with me, paid</p>

               <p>for them, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and I gave the packet to him—on 2nd November I went by the night train to Bridge of Allan—Meikiejohn had recommended me to go there—firstly, because it was a salubrious place; and, secondly, be<lb/>cause it was near Edinburgh, and also because he stated that he had a friend there named Monteith, manager of the branch of the Clydesdale Bank at Bridge of Allan—when I got to Bridge of Allan I stayed at the Queen's Hotel, under the name of Young—Kurr came to me on Saturday, 4th November, the day after I arrived—Meikiejohn came with him—I lad previously made inquiries about Mr. Monteith, and when I saw Meikiejohn I told him I had discovered there was no Clydesdale Bank at the Bridge of Allan, and that though Mr. Monteith did live at Bridge of Allan, it was true, but it was his private residence; that he had originally been joint manager of the branch at Stirling, and had just been promoted to the sole managership of the Alloa branch—on entering the hotel I asked Meiklejohn (he told me he had but a short time to remain) if he would kindly send to Monteith, asking him to come round, and he drew out one of his own cards and wrote something on it and then gave me the card—I handed it to the landlord of the hotel and asked him to send it up immediately to Bombay House, where Mr. Monteith resided, to ask Monteith to come down immediately—the message came back that Mr. Monteith was not at home, that he was not expected till late that night, and consequently he did not come—(<hi rend="italic">card handed</hi>)—that is the one. (<hi rend="italic">Real</hi>: "Mr. John Meikiejohn, Inspector of Detective Police, Scot-laud Yard.") On the back is written: "Mr. Monteith will be kind enough. to come to the Queen's Hotel as soon as possible"—I was then told what arrangement had been made for the next day, Sunday—they began by tell<lb/>ing me that they had met in Edinburgh Wilson and Gollan, and that they had made an appointment that the two were to come on the nest day, Sun<lb/>day morning, to the Bridge of Allan, and that they would be there in time for breakfast—I strongly objected to their coming to the Queen's Hotel, and Meiklejohn upheld me—Kurr was in favour that they should come, but I asked Meiklejohu whether there was not a place not far from Bridge of Allan where we could adjourn without its being at the Queen's Hotel he said "Yes, why not go to Dumblane, it is only a few miles?"—four miles I think from Bridge of Allan—he said "It is half-way between Bridge of Allan and my father's house," where he was going on—that was Green Loaming—I asked the landlord whether he could <hi rend="italic">give</hi> notice at Dumblane so that we might find dinner ready, inasmuch as Wilson and Gollan would have to return that same night, Sunday, and, there was only one train, and by my instructions he telegraphed to the Stirling Arms at Dumblane and ordered dinner for five—it was then agreed that I should leave Bridge of Allan early in the morning, Sunday, drive to Green Loaming and fetch Meikiejohn, whilst Kurr would meet the other two at the station, take them back to the hotel, where he would engage a special room for them, and after I had left he would walk to Dumblane with them, and we should meet all at dinner—Meikle<lb/>john then left me—before he left I asked him if he would introduce me to Mr. Monteith—he said he would, and that is all that transpired then—to the best of my recollection he returned by the 5 something train—no arrangement was made about meeting Monteith that night—I had not then seen him—the next day I drove to Green Loaming, fetched Meiklejohn away, and drove him back to Dutnblane—we all dined</p>

               <p>together, Meiklejohn, Kurr, Wilson, Gollan, and I—I afterwards drove Meiklejohn back part of the way to Green Loaming, and on the road I asked him whether be would not give me an introduction to Mr. Monteith—I said that it was early enough, and that in all probability it being Sunday, I should be able to catch Monteith at home that same evening, and see him before he went to the bank in the morning, and moreover make an appointment for Mr. Monteith to see Meiklejohn the next morning, as Meiklejohn was going back to Derby the next day—he said he would do so, and asked me what form of introduction I should like—I said "Simply give me a card, write a few lines of introduction." He got out of the cab and wrote a few lines at the back of this card—I took it with me, and after making an appointment with Meiklejohn to breakfast with us next morning, I drove straight to Bombay House, where Mr. Monteith resided, and gave the card to the servant who opened the door—I was shown into the drawing-room and Monteith came a few minutes afterwards—that was on Sunday, the 5th—I saw him again next moruing—Meiklejohn came to breakfast with us on the Monday, and the next day, the 7th, I opened an account at the Alloa branch of the Clydesdale Bank—I paid in 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the paying-in slip:" Clydesdale Banking Company, 7th Nov., 1876.

"While at dinner we received another telegram—this is the substance of it: "If Shanks is with you, let him leave you immediately. leaves to-night and will be at Bridge of Allan by the first train in the morning. Very important."—In consequence of that telegram I made up my mind to leave—the telegram came about eight o'clock, before we had done dinner—I left that same night—I apologised to Mr. Monteith and went away—my servant went with me—we arrived at Perth about one o'clock in the morning, stayed for the night, the next day I went to Linlithgow—(James Irvine Midwinter, <hi rend="italic">Clerk to Mr. Abrahams, proved the service of a notice to produce, on Meiklejohn on 12th October</hi>)—Meiklejohn handed me a letter he had received from London from Druscovich the morning before—I did not read it—I read the enclosure—I stayed at Linlithgow a day, and then went to Derby, where I arrived at five on Sunday morning—I went to the Midland Hotel—I saw Meiklejohn at his house, and asked him whether he had heard why I was compelled to leave so suddenly—he said "No"—I asked him if he was aware Druscovich had turned up suddenly in Edinburgh, and then at Bridge of Allan—he said he had heard nothing on the subject, and asked for particulars, which I gave him—I then asked Meiklejohn to go to Bridge</p>

I want some important information from you as to your knowledge as to three persons who have been staying here.

               <p>that he could not come on Monday, as he had important business but that he would come the next night—I said "What is he going to say about the men mentioned?"—he said all he could say was that lie knew some men, but the description in the paper was not the same as would answer my description—I then told him that I had received a telegram from Kurr, which I could not make head or tail of—I showed him the telegram—to the best of my remembrance it was: "Go to Mrs. Dubliaton thence to the place where Strasbourg was telegraphed from, prepare every tiling to be ready to go to Hookey town." I could not understand it all—Kurr arrived that same evening at about seven o'clock—Meikle<lb/>john was there when he came—I asked Kurr what news there was—he said "No news whatever," he could get no information in London: Drus<lb/>covich was still dow n in Scotland—Kurr explained that the telegram which lie had sent M'as meant to read "Go to Dublin, thence to the place where Strasburg was telegraphed from," which wai Queenstown, because we had sent a telegram to Reinhardt from Queenstown; "thence to New York."—I asked "Why to New York?"—he said "Because they want you to be away"—"they" meant Palmer and Clarke—I asked Kurr what he had done with Murray—he paid, after some persuasion, that lie had induced Murray to leave that night for Alloa, he was to go on to Stirling, and the next morning he would present the drafts at Alloa—he said he had no doubt that Murray would succeed in obtaining the money, and that all wouldbe right—I had no English money, and I said I should feel obliged if lie would send mo English bank notes; that I would then go to Dublin that night and await instructions from him as to what port I could embark from, and as soon as I had definite information and the money I should embark for <hi rend="italic">Isavf</hi> York—Kurr said to feiklejoim "Under the circumstances I think it is very much better that I should not telegraph to you any more to your oilice, where had I better telegraph to you?"—he said "You had better telegraph to me in the name of Thompson at the Railway Hotel and the Midland Hotel, Derby; where shall I telegraph to you?"—he said you had better telegraph to the name of Matthews, at the Mitre, Kingsgate Street"—that is in Holborn, London—I then left Leicester and went to Dublin by Holyhead—I stayed at the Gresham Hotel in Dutdin—my servant was with me—I stayed until Fridaj night, 17th November—while in Dublin I sent away my servant to New York in the steamer Polynesian, of the Allan Line, which went from London<lb/>derry to Portland, in the state of Maine—I gave him both telegrams and letters which lie was to post from New York—I left Dublin and went to Rugby, and from there to Birmingham, and from there to Heading, where I arrived on Monday, 20th November—I met Kurr at the Reading station, and we came on to London—we arrived at about ten o'clock at night, and we met Street on our arrival at Paddington—we got into a cab at ihe station, and drove somewhere on the south side of the lhames, about Kennington—Kurr and Street got out of the cab, and wero absent at Jesist two hours—I remained in the cab—when they returned they made a communication to me—we drove then to St. Katherine's Wharf, and I left by the boat in the morning for Boulogne, went to Brussels for two or three days, and afterwards proceeded to Rotterdam, where I stayed at the New Bath Hotel in the name of Morton—on Sunday, 26th November, <hi rend="italic">Y.</hi> Kurr and Bale both came to the hotel—I knew they had been in Rotterdam since Friday, but did not know</p>

               <p>where to find them—Frederick Kurr took the name of Collins, and Bale that of Taylor—on the 1st December I gave one Clydesdale note to the landlord to change, and the next day we were all three taken in custody by the Dutch authorities—I had 25 Clydesdale notes more on me—I received a telegram when in custody, and afterwards a second telegram, on 8th of December I think, from Froggatt—one was sent on the day of my arrest, and that was not delivered to me till some days after—the second telegram reached me first—this is the telegram which was placed in my hands after the second telegram.

               <p>means of which I first became acquainted with Kurr was one requiring "a person who could write articles on any given subject—I answered it in writing, and subsequently in person—I was engaged to write a leading article in a piper—there was no salary named at the time—I Was asked to give my services at first on probation; I did so one week—subsequently I received five guineas per week simply for writing one article weekly sometimes two—at first I did not know the article was manufactured for the purposes of fraud—I was two mouths before I discovered it—I was not taken in as partner in the fraud till another two months—I was afterwards mixed up with Kurr in the different frauds up to the time of my arrest—I only participated in the profits equally with Kurr once, in the De Goncourt fraud—in the others I received one-eighth and ouf-fifth.—Kurr concocted the schemes and I assisted in carrying them out—I did the foreign element—outside these frauds, and before I became mixed up with Kurr, I once assumed an alias for the purposes of fraud—in Brus-els and in Paris I assumed the name of Count de Montaigu for social purposes, not for the purposes of fraud, for getting into society under a false name and title—that was in 1871—I was successful socially—in Brussels I was not the whole time under the name of Count de Montaigu, I was both in my own name, Benson, and that name—both were not equally successful socially—I passed in both names at the same time—I was Benson to some people and Montaigu to others—I lived in very good style at that time—I used both names on my cards; I had a double set—I represented the <hi rend="italic">Gaulois</hi> paper at that time in the name of Benson—I was both Benson and Montaigu to my employers—I shrouded myself in air of mystery as Benson, and said it was an assumed name, that in reality I belonged to a noble family—I represented myself in Brussels as the son of a general officer—that was all false—I did not cease to be Montaigu after leaving Brussels—T went to Nice for two months after leaving Brussels—at Nice I was Montaigu—I dropped Benson—the name of Montaigu was assumed for social purposes—I do not know that it ended in fraud—I swear that—there was a process against me, but I do not know for what purpose—I took care to go—I do not know for certainty that it was for forging the name of Montaigu—I knew a man named Picard there—ho was not my friend—he was an acquaintance—hewas originally a barrister—he was then playing 1 at Monaco—I imagine the process was in connection with a forged bill, but I do not know it—it was suggested that I forged the natle of Montaigu—I left Nice for Paris on Oct. lutli, 1871—I was at Paris two or three weeks as Benson—I continued the name of Count de Montaigu also in London for social purposes always—I was socially successful in London under an assumed name and false title—I continued the name of Montaigu till my arrest on 23rd November, 1871, for the Lord Mayor's fraud—another name I assumed was Marquis Montmorenci, for the pur<lb/>pose of fraud, I am sorry to say—I had 12 months' imprisonment—when I came out of prison I passed as Yonge until April last year—when 1—went to Biarritz on 9th July last year I changed my name to Montapo, altering two letters—that was not fraudulent—if it is "fraudulent" in the depositions it is a mistake—it was without any intention to commit fraud—from Biarritz I went to Paris in the same name—in connection with these frauds I assumed no othr name—I did not assume the name of Prince Murat, although I led Clarke to believe it—I said before the magistrate</p>

               <p>the magistrate that I hoped to get a remission of a portion of my sentence—if you will repeat the question as you put it to me at the police-court I will tell you what I said—von asked me if I had any hope, and I said that "he, indeed, would be utterly hopeless who had no hope"—I did not say I hoped to get a remission of a portion of my sentence—you said that I said I hoped—that was all I said—I meant by that that every man has a hope—you asked me that question, and I at first refused to reply to it—I simply said I hoped, and you added the word "remission"—I was not asked whether I hoped to get a remission of my sentence—I was asked "Have you any hope?" and I said "Yes I have," after being very much pressed, and then you added "Have you any hope of remission?" and I refused to answer the question—in reply to the question "Do you have a hope that you will be let loose again on society?" I said "Yes"—I did mean to convey by that that I hoped to get a remission of my sentence—I saw the City solicitor, Mr. Nelson, besides the interviews I had with the solicitors to the Treasury—that was on the 18th of June or July—I made a communication to him—the interview with him lasted about an hour—I did not swear before the magistrate that I had bribed Inspector Bailey of the City Police—I distinctly refused to say that I had bribed Bailey or anyone else—I did say that 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week was set aside for a considerable time for Inspector Bailey—I do not remember saying that from circumstances that subsequently came to my knowledge I was convinced that he had received it—I will not swear that I did not—I did say since the 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week was set aside for Inspector Bailey that I believed he was bribed—it was set aside for about six weeks—that was in connection with the Murray and Walters fraud, the Insurance against Losses on the Turf—I did mention a person of the name of Andrews at Shanklin during the investigation—I became acquainted with Andrews by means of an adver<lb/>tisement—that was in February or March, 1875—I answered his adver<lb/>tisement—I do not know that it was relative to a partnership, in the advertisement it was simply that somebody wanted to borrow money on good security, offering good security, and I answered it in the name of Yonge—Andrews came down to Shanklin to see me, and I subsequently agreed to place a certain sum of money in his business without incurring any risk—the sum was 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Andrews was to find the business; the business was in existence—I do not think he was to find any money, nor do I think he found any—I suggested very much later that he should borrow a cheque for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I put in something like 2,600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it is easily proved—I did not subsequently suggest to him that he should borrow a cheque from Hodingham—I did not know from whom he should borrow it or where—he brought me a cheque upon Hollingham for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I do not know that Hollingham charged Andrews with stealing it—I took it and used the proceeds—I knew it was not obtained fraudulently—the fraud on the Lord Mayor for which I suffered 12 months' imprisonment was for falsely representing myself to be the Mayor of Chatreaudun, and obtaining a sum of 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from the Lord Mayor—that was in connection with the French war—it was a fund for the relief of Chatreaudun that I wanted to organise, and it was a fund that was being raised at the Mansion House for the purpose of aiding the French—I first became aware that Kurr intended to set up an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>, during the trial, after the trial had commenced—Kurr's witnesses <hi rend="italic">were</hi> called on the Friday, and to</p>

               <p>the best of my recollection he told me on the Thursday, or perhaps on the Friday before, I should not like to say—I believe it was on the Thursday he told me that he intended setting up an <hi rend="italic">alibi</hi>—he did not tell me that he bad been offered two <hi rend="italic">stretches</hi> instead of ten—what he said to me was that if he chose to give information he had been told by his own solicitor that it was probable or possible that he might get two <hi rend="italic">stretches</hi> instead of more, but he did not say ten—at that time the sentence was not passed—before bis sentence he told me that—by giving information, I mean giving information against the prisoners—Colkett went by the name of "Sheer-ness" in this correspondence, also by the name of "Keetus"—I did at gome time intend going to Egypt—that was what I stated—it was in June, 1876—I was going to Egypt for two purposes—the first was, at least at the time I speak to, I had an intention of raising a loan, but it failed—I mean by that a loan for the Viceroy of Egypt—I was going to raise the loan with a body of capitalists—I did not enter into communication with the Viceroy directly, but indirectly—I communicated with his son—that was a bona <hi rend="italic">fide</hi> loan, which did not come off—I also wished to get rid of certain fraudulent Bastrop bonds—that was also my purpose in going to Egypt—I Knew that they were worthless, and I tried to get some more—with regard to those that were in my possession, I attempted to pass, and did pass some of them off—I knew a man named Colletso—I only knew him by that name—he did put himself into communication with me and Kurr for the purpose, as he then stated, of embarking a large sum of money in the turf frauds—I did not telegraph abroad for the purpose of making in<lb/>quiries about him and find that he was a swindler—a telegram was sent, and I incurred a loss of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 16<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; more, I believe, 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I received a large quantity of Bastrop bonds from Colletso—I do not know howmany sheets of them, but I received the nominal value of 100,000 dols., but the real value <hi rend="italic">nil—I</hi> received those bonds with a draft from Colletso to try and negotiate the draft, giving the bonds as a collateral security, and to raise a sum of 8,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., not to invest in my frauds at that time when he actually gave me the bonds; it was not for that purpose, it was to float bis own company, the Bastrop Coal Company—Colletso got nothing for his bonds—I kept them all—I did not endeavour to sell them—I endeavoured on raise money upon them, but I never endeavoured to sell them or sold hem—I endeavoured to raise money upon them at the time I knew they cere worth nothing—I had not expended a farthing, Kurr endeavoured of get his money back—I believe that was at the time he represented a etective—I have no doubt about it from what I have heard—either Kurr Walters told me so—one of them represented the detective, I know—I should not like to say whether both told me so or one—I know one told ie so, perhaps both—they told me that on one Sunday night they had roceeded to the Midland Grand Hotel, where Colletso resided, and that they had asked Colletso—one of them had represented himself as being a Richardson, a detective, and said that he had come to claim a sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I should not like to swear which, which had been incurred sending telegrams at his (Colletso's) desire, and that they wished him refund it, otherwise they would arrest him—Colletso laughed at it, the ruse, if it was a ruse, did not succeed—I never heard that when had gone to the Midland Hotel, one of them representing himself as detective, and that they had searched him and turned his pockets out I never heard of it until you mentioned it at the police-court—I repre<lb/>sented</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220148"/>
               <p>that my lameness was the result of an accident on the London and North-Western Railway; that was untrue—I made that statement fre<lb/>quently at Shanklin—I led it to be inferred that Yonge was not my real name that in reality I was a person of distinction, passing, for reasons of my own' under the name of Yonge—I don't know that I forced myself into society by that means—I went into society very much before that—I remember making a list of the warders of Newgate—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—that was taken from me—a letter was also taken away from me alleged to be addressed from Bale's father to my father; that was Kurr's invention—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is it—it was written by Kurr, and passed to me in Newgate, and found in my pocket; it was sent to me to know what I thought of it. (<hi rend="italic">This purported to be written by Bale's father to Benson's father, and was an urgent appeal to him to aid in subscribing the necessary amount to settle with Madame de Goncourt, and so avert the disgrace upon a family of unsullied honour.</hi>) I did not know then that Bale had no father, I heard it at the trial—that letter was passed to me to know if I would consent that such a letter should be sent to my father—I believe Bale was a greengrocer before he was associated with me in these frauds—this other letter to my father was taken from me on 21st March, together with another letter to Kurr—the letter to Kurr was written first, I should not like to say how long before the one to my father, perhaps a day, I believe a day; the one to Kurr was written on Tuesday, 20th, and the other on the 21st, before twelve o'clock—they were both written within a day following (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "My dear Father,—You may imagine what depth of despair and distress I must have reached to dare address you whom I have so fearfully wronged and grieved; but in you is now centred my only hope, and therefore, it is better that I should face your just wrath than depute a third person to do. I will not (nor can I, for I am so sick of hopes constantly deferred) tell you how each day, during the last six weeks, has dawned with a faint prospect of success, and how it has closed with no hope. To live as I have done for months now is worse than death. I am now driven to the limits of my reason. I have lost all hope. Despair has hold of me, and in the extremity of my need I turn to you, who are my father, and beg you to save me. I know I have no right to ask you for anything, nor would I even do so were you to run any risk, but you (under God) have it in your sole power to save me from my doom. Were I to tell you what the result of my reflections has been, that I have formed, and with God's help, will carry out, good resolves, you would probably and also reason<lb/>ably retort 'I don't believe you, you have made so many professions and and so few promises have you kept that I will not and cannot believe you.' Yet I am sincere this time, so help me God. I intend to carry out my good resolves if I am set free, and I intend to commit suicide if I am prosecuted. I can do you one good turn by saving you from the fearful <hi rend="italic">expose</hi> of a <hi rend="italic">cause celebre</hi>, and I will do so, for my judges I will not face. What mercy could I expect from strangers when my own father refuses to save me? But is flesh and blood nothing? Am I not flesh of your flesh, the bone of your bone; and is not blood stronger than water. That letter was intended to go to my father in Paris—that letter was written after I had written this one to Kurr, within twenty-four hours. Mr. Williams <hi rend="italic">here read portions of the letter, which the witness explained as follows</hi>:—"Another straw for us to cling to—supposing that Baxter were of Batty's opinion, here is our negotiation, Forbes," that is Madame da</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220149"/>
               <p>Goncourt, "Forbes there says I won't be married," meaning I will not prosecute, "we know this, and we send that b——f——Batty to his dear friend Monkey"—"Batty" is Mr. Humphreys, "Monkey" is the Treasury—I think so, it represents the prosecution—I believe it repre<lb/>sents the solicitor to the Treasury, Mr. Stephenson or Mr. Pollard—I don't know; it represents the solicitor to the Treasury, whoever he may be. "The family has settled with Cowdery, he won't come"—"Cowdery" is another name for Madame de Goncourt. "You have a good excuse, therefore, to close up the whole affair while pretending to figure, and my clients will if you drop it and Forbes be satisfied <hi rend="italic">give</hi> you some flower show information," that is information concerning the police. "Monkey's honour will be saved, Cowdery satisfied, and Monarch gets what he fancies will enable him to renovate the gardener's system"—"Monarch" is the Treasury; this was language thoroughly understood between Kurr and myself, and was invented as we went on. "Thomas Taper can say nothing"—that is the press—"and the country would be saved a lot of expense. This I fancy will suit the the b——f——, he will be able to show his pomposity and say 'Through me the whole affair is ended.' Through me Monarch knew all about it. Indeed yesterday the beast began winking at me, and said, 'You will never know what I have (tone for you, but you will find the good of it later' (yes, 15 pennorths)." When I wrote this letter I had hopes that a settlement might be arrived at; when I wrote the other letter, I knew it was no use—my penitence came with my loss of hope of a settlement. "I may tell you that the governor has ordered no books to be destroyed anywhere until further orders," that is "telegrams." "I have got no confidence at all in him, and the only trust I can put in him is in the fact of the ludicrous vanity in which I have now to play. Our position is simply this. If Baxter ays, 'You are all right, provided Forbes does not get married,' hen we tell Batty to go and consult and learn his lessons from a clever lan. If he says, 'Batty is right,' I leave it to Williams to decide hether or not we adopt the gardener scheme besides satisfying orbes." "Williams" there means Kurr. "If not, we must prepare the very worst, if I have not been able to send out my <hi rend="italic">flick</hi> to Sheer-ess," that is, my letter to Colkett. "Don't detain Batty long, but pack off at once. If Baxter says we are right, then Sheerness goes to atty the first thing to-morrow. Baxter is my man"—Baxter is George Lewis. "Harwood has planned and schemed all his but he never planned and schemed as much in his hole life as he has done for the last three months"—"Harwood" is (self—I have schemed all my life, and never so much as in the last three nths before writing that letter "to get out of prison, but unfortunately thout success hitherto, for as fast as one thing has been squared a greater ficulty has turned up. Be sure you put Sheerness's letter in a sealed develope; I find I have none, and it is not good enough to give it open a <hi rend="italic">'screw'"</hi>—that is a warder—"Harwood will leave it with Batty; tract Batty to send it forthwith to Keetus"—that is Colkett—"I will with Elong to meet Moppy"—Elong was one of the warders, 0 is gone—"if Batty reports favourably I will write letter to Mrs. L., manage to let Sheerness have it before he leaves Birmingham"—is Newgate—"only I don't know the address. Be sure you read before you leave Harvey"—Harvey was my solicitor, Mr. Humphreys;</p>

               <p>he also had <hi rend="italic">two</hi> names—"and do not give Fathead any flicks for outside"—Fathead was a warder—"he is on duty to-night, and will call on you for flicks for me every half-hour, so be ready when he calls"—he was calling for letters every half-hour—"Elong is the only one in whom any faith is to be placed; he is the only one who knows of the Hatton haunt"—I don't know what that is; I have not forgotten what it means, but I don't know where it was; it was some place of meeting for the purpose of giving information, for the purpose of receiving letters—"A thought has just struck me about Hood"—I don't know who he was, ho was not a man that came to see me in Newgate, I believe it is Kurr—"he says that everything is so awfully dear in Dublin"—that is, in Paris—"and he forwards the amount of his bill, which is under 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he has had 40; it shows that he takes us fur b——f——s not to know the value of Irish money"—that means French money—"he will get the diamonds and gang to Hookeyland"—that means, get the money and go to New York—"this I defy him to do unless he cracks Poole's drum, which. God forbid"—that is, unless he breaks open the place where the notes are kept, and takes them away. Having written that letter on the 20th, I still say I was sincere in the letter I wrote to my father within twenty-four hours.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. The language in that letter is not language that I have been in the habit of using with Kurr in conversa<lb/>tion—all those terms, with the exception of my nickname and Kurr's, were settled after wo were taken into custody; it is perfectly obvious that they must have bean—<hi rend="italic">flicks</hi> is an understood term, and so is "drum"—I never saw Druscovich until I saw him at Rotterdam, at the Tribunal de Correctionale—the proceedings there were conducted in French and in Dutch—I understand French thoroughly—Druscovich speaks French—Druscovich mentioned my name in the court there, and identified me as Benson—he said he had been present at certain proceedings at the Mansion House in London—I was at this time passing in the name of George Washington Morton—I denied that I was Benson—I heard Druscovich say that if I was examined certain marks would be found—there were very large scars—the jewellery was purchased at Benson's, on Ludgate Hill, on November 1st, I do not remember whether at my suggestion or at Kurr's—it was quite understood that it was for Mrs. Druscovich—20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was paid for it, not 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a gold necklet, and the medallion was a carbuncle set in gold, with a diamond in the centre—I only saw one telegram from Druscovich to Meiklejohn at Derby, and I do not know that any others were sent—Meiklejohn most decidedly conveyed to my mind that at the time Druscovich borrowed the money of William Kurr, he believed him to be the owner of racehorses; I am quite clear as to that.</p>

               <p>Nicholls, a private inquiry agent, was employed by him—I told him that I was employed as agent for the French Government, and that secret service money might pass through his hands—I did not tell him that personally I could make the money pass through his hands—I mentioned a large sum, I forget whether it was 200,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I said that I was indirectly an agent for the French Government—I also represented to Mr. Nicholls that I was receiving, directly, information from the great chief, that is Colonel Henderson, of Scotland Yard—that was not true—I was deceiving Mr. Nicholls while I was employing him—at the same time I was keeping up, by my newspaper and with my house, a neat appearance amongst the people of Shanklin—I also represented to Mr. Nicholls that I was in communication with the Empress of Austria, who was then staying in Norfolk; and told him that there was a possibility, through my means of introduction, of her honouring Shanklin with a visit, but not of honouring Rose Bank—I intended visiting the Empress, and I believe I did say so, because it was my intention—from 12th April to the end of 1875 I was in the habit of conducting my own correspondence—before going to the Isle of "Wight, Mrs. Avis had never been employed by me to write or copy any letters; but on the 13th of April I asked her to copy for me the draft of the first letter which I wrote to Inspector Clarke, and she continued to copy letters for me until she left on the 5th My, 1875—after that I wrote in my own hand—after July I had no housekeeper in my service, but I had a cook—the establishment at Rose Bank then consisted of the cook, the housemaid, the coachman, and Piquot—this letter, dated Sept. 15, was written by me to Clarke—the Trevelli mentioned in it is the person to whom I have referred—I do not know where he is; he was sentenced, I believe, to five years' penal servitude. <hi rend="italic">This letter was dated September</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">and signed T.

I daresay in the course of a couple of days I shall be able to give you some valuable news.") From the date of that letter I had not constantly represented to Clarke that I could obtain information for him about the persons implicated in these frauds, and any point which he wanted elucidated I would endeavour to clear up—that was honest so far as concerned the turf frauds—I was honestly representing to Clarke that I was getting information for him, and I was getting it from Kurr—Palmer was not one of the <hi rend="italic">two</hi> names mentioned at Scotland Yard as having been bribed—I am sure of that—I remember two out of these three letters from Inspector Clarke in September, 1875—the one I do not remember is dated 28.9.75—it is in Clarke's writing, and has the Shanklin post-mark (<hi rend="italic">Read: "</hi> Sept. 14, 1875, from George Clarke, of 20, Gt.

Mrs. Avis left Rose Bank on 5th July, 1875, and went to live at 44, Cawley Road Victoria Park—Mr. Hall, her son-in-law, was living somewhere in the north of London, I believe—Mrs. Avis continued to live at Cawley Road till March, 1876—I was in communication with her every quarter—I made her an allowance down to the time I was taken in custody—when she left Cawley Road she went to live in Leaconfield Road, somewhere in the north—I never saw her there—I saw her once in London, I believe it was in February at Bentinck Street, Cavendish Square—I have seen her once since then, in Newgate—when I first went to live with her her husband was living—I went simply to be taken care of, as I was very ill from the effect of the burning in Newgate—my friends made her an allowance of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week for taking charge of me—that continued for some time—the address was Paradise Terrace, Dalston—her husband died at the end of 1874—I did not give her any wages at Rose Bank, but have since made her an allowance of 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I did not see Mrs. Hall at any time during 1876—when I was in Newgate a man whom I knew by the name of Harrison called upon me—I believe his name was Izard, but am not sure—I only knew him by the name of Harrison—he lived at Dalston, either the "Waterloo Road or the Wellington Road, I am not sure which—Mrs. Avis came to see me in Newgate three or four times—Mr. George Lewis was my father's solicitor—he declined to take up the case for my defence upon the previous prosecution.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. I asked Mr. George Lewis to act for me on Saturday, 13th February, when I saw him at the police-court, at first he said he would see mo on the subject, but afterwards he refused—he was defending Kurr then—the telegram sent by Mr. Froggatt on 4th Dec. was not received by me until after the receipt of the second telegram of Dec. 14, which was "From Mr. Froggatt, 6, Argyle Street. <hi rend="italic">Poodle</hi> instructs mo to defend the others, shall I defend you?" It was upon that both telegrams were given me—I know nothing of Froggatt at that time—I had seen his name as a solicitor practising in this Court, in the news<lb/>papers, but he was an utter stranger to me—he employed a Dutch advocate named Arras to appear for me upon the question as to whether I should be sent out of the country or not—I only saw Mr. Froggatt once at Rotterdam—the Dutch advocate appeared for me—on Jan. 12th I came from Rotterdam to London—about the end of January Mr. Froggatt declined to act, so I placed my case and Kurr's in the hands of Messrs Humphreys and Son—I simply consulted thorn about my case—I saw them or their clerk constantly—I went from the House of Detention to Newgate on 10th February—sometime in March I made a suggestion that I was willing to give back the money and to be lot out on bail—someone went to Franco for me from Messrs. Humphreys and Son—when I first came over I wished to return the whole 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Madame de Goncourt—I was willing to hand over to her the Scotch notes—I hoped then that the proseeutrix would not come at all—I thought there would be no prosecution if the money was returned—I said at the police-court "During; my communication with Mr. Froggatt I had no idea of inducing him to act as an accessory to any crime that I committed"—he told me that with regard to the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had received that money in advance for his costs, as payment—I was of opinion that ho was trying to perform his duty</p>

               <p>to me properly and faithfully as a solicitor—the words I used before the magistrate were "Mr. Froggatt said the note was given to him simply in payment"—I believe the date of the conversation with Flintoff was 17th January; at was a Wednesday, I think—on Thursday, 8th February, Froggatt said that he had taken out a summons against Flintoff—I am positive it was either the 7th or 8th February—at that time Mr. Froggatt told me that Mr. Flintoff had stated at the trial that he, Froggatt, had offered him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. not to identify Kurr—he appeared extremely indignant and angry, and said that he had taken out a summons for perjury against Flintoff—I have said I did not attempt to influence Mr. Froggatt to bribe any one, he made no suggestion to me"—it was on 15th January that he said that Kurr would not trust him—the first time the name of Flintoff was mentioned was either 15th or 17th January.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When Froggatt told me that he had taken out a sum<lb/>mons against Flintoff, I was in one of the rooms reserved for interviews between solicitors and prisoners at the House of Detention—I was first taken there on 13th January—Stenning was tried at this Court about the 6th or 7th; Flintoff gave evidence—it was perhaps a day after I had heard that the trial had taken place that Froggatt told me that he had taken out a summons against Flintoff—I had never seen Froggatt before he came to Rotterdam—I knew there was such a gentleman—it was at Rotterdam he told me he had got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Clydesdale notes in payment—he did not say for what, or who had given it him—he did not tell me any<lb/>thing more than that—I asked him how the case was proceeding with Hurray, who was in custody, and he told me Murray had appeared at the police-court on the previous Saturday, when Mr. Poland had made some remark about that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, and then Froggatt told me that he had got this note in payment—there were two people in the room—I did not choose to go into particulars, so made no further inquiry on the subject, either then or subsequently—I asked my solicitor whether, if I gave the information that was required, I might be admitted to bail—I do not know that there was the understanding that we should not sur<lb/>render, but in point of fact we should not have surrendered—it was either at the end of February, or the beginning of March, that this con<lb/>versation took place—our solicitor told us it was absurd—it was from something Kurr had told me that I surmised that the Treasury required information respecting the police—I never heard it definitely—it was afterwards suggested that if we might only be tried for the misde<lb/>meanour, obtaining the money by false pretences, we would plead guilty and restore the money—Mr. Williams asked me this: "I demand to know whether you do not expect your term of imprisonment to be shortened by giving this evidence; "I replied "I expect nothing, but I have hopes, and I submit, Mr. Williams, that that is a matter con<lb/>cerning me alone; I have had no intimation to encourage any expec<lb/>tations of this kind, but I hope for more mercy than I am likely to get from you"—I had no intimation, inducement, or allurement of any kind, at that time or since, to encourage any expectations—I <hi rend="italic">lived</hi> with Mrs. Avis about nineteen months before I went to Shanklin—her husband was then ahve—he died on 22nd December, 1874—I did not go to Shanklin till 16th January—Mrs. Avis is about sixty, I should think—she has a son-in-law named Hall—she has several children; one of them, a son, was at school for about two years at my expense—I made her the allowance</p>

               <p>because she was exceedingly kind to me, and for no other reason whatever—there has been no improper conduct between myself and Mrs. Avis; if such a thing is suggested, there is not the slightest foundation for it—I last saw her on 20th April in Newgate while the trial was pending—the last time I saw her while I was out of Newgate was in Bentinck Street to the best of my recollection—the reason I got her to copy the letters to Clarke was because I did not wish any of my writing to fall into Clarke's hands at the time those letters were written—the letters she wrote were written between 13th April and 5th July—I was last at Shanklin on 27th June, 1876—I was perfectly unaware that Mrs. Avis had kept copies of the letters I had given her, till the drafts were placed in my hands in the police-court—in June, 1876, I gave some instructions to Mr. Clarke, a schoolmaster in Shanklin, with reference to some of my papers—Mr. Clarke, the defendant, came down to Shanklin for the first time on 12th April, and then I had a conversation with him—in that conversation mention was made of Mr. Hall, Mrs. Avis's son-in-law—Inspector Clarke said that if I had not asked to see him, he would have come down just the same, for he had received a written communication, which he showed me, signed "Hall," to the effect that I could give information on the matter of the turf fraud—the names of the visitors who came to Shanklin were, as a general rule, published in the paper; they are sent by the hotel-keepers—I did not see Clarke's name there—I had a communication from the Empress of Austria—I was desirous that she should visit the island—she could not come—I received this letter from the Austrian Ambassador; it is in French, in English it reads: "Austrian and Hungarian Embassy in London. London, 3rd April, 1876. Sir,—In answer to the request sent by you, in the name of the inhabitants of Shauklin, to Her Majesty the Empress, dated 23rd March, I am authorised to inform you that Her Majesty, whilst exceedingly touched by the sentiments of respect and of sympathy for her august person which have inspired your request, has not been able to accept or to give her' patronage to what you ask.—<hi rend="italic">Signed</hi> Beust." Nicholls was first employed by Captain Harvey, then by me—I paid him—while in the House of Detention and in Newgate letters passed between Kurr and myself, but never after we were convicted—I was under the impression that they had all been destroyed—they were nearly all written in a language intelligible only to ourselves—I was acquainted, before I went to Newgate, with a good many slang expressions—"the brief is out" means the warrant—the nicknames alluded to in the course of cor<lb/>respondence we fixed upon as we went along, when for the first time and in future we should call them by the nickname—I got letters conveyed to Kurr by bribing the warders—I used to leave com<lb/>munications sometimes for Kurr, sometimes with the solicitor, as solicitor's instructions—I first became acquainted with Coletso, I think, in October, 1874—I knew him as Dr. Colitzo—I did not know till after his arrest that he had another name, Gray—he was an American—the Bastrop Coal Mine did exist in Texas; but it was not so productive as was represented—Coletso was endeavouring to bring out the mine—Coletso was endeavouring to convert the American company into an English company—I got two bonds from Meiklejohn after the interview in June—I also had from him some blank cheques—Druscovich was present when I was tried for the offence against the Lord Mayor—he was not a witness</p>

               <p>Venables—another arrangement was made for Monday, and on that day at eleven o'clock, I again found my way to the Scotch Stores, when' told me that his friends were in London, and that we could have an interview—in consequence of that we went to some house—I don't know the name of the street, but it is two or three turnings on the right hand side down Oxford Street, from Argyll Street, going from Oxford Circus, somewhere near Soho—Froggatt was with me, and introduced me to two gentlemen; one of them spoke to me—Mr. said "This is the party that comes from Paris. Now, transact your own business"—I had a conversation then with these gentlemen—Eromatt remained with us the whole time—he was sitting next to me, much nearer to me than the person I was speaking to—the conversation was in English—Froggatt said "This is the gentleman who has the notes" and he told me, "This is the gentleman who will buy them. Now arrrnge your terms"—the person who spoke to me was a foreigner—the other was also a foreigner, I believe, by his accent, but he spoke English very fluently—I asked the gentleman who spoke to me if he was prepared to make an offer—I told him there were 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes; that there were no means of identification; no numbers were taken of them; and that it only required somebody of position to pay them through the bank, and there would be no more bother about getting the money for them—the party said "Well, I am not buying and selling too. I leave it to you; and let me know what you will let me have them for"—I told him that if he would hand mo over 9,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he couldhave them, but I must have the money in French notes or English gold—he ridiculed the idea of changing 10,0007. for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and said that the least that they would undertake it for would be 15 per cent., 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told him that as the notes did not belong to me, I was not prepared to meet his offer, but if he would allow me an hour or two I would meet the parties to whom they belonged, and then give him an answer. We were to meet again at two or three o'clock in the same afternoon at Pamphilion's Restaurant in Argyll Street—I went there at the time appointed, after having seen William Kurr—I found Froggatt there. We went back together to this house I had formerly visited, where the two gentlemen from France were—Froggatt went with me—on the first occasion we had gone to a bedroom—the second time we went into the front parlour—I found the same two men there, and had a conversa<lb/>tion with them—Froggatt was present at the time. I made them an offer, and told them I was not prepared to aocept their terms of 15 per cent., but they could have the notes for 10 per cent., which would be 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the party who had conversed with me before said that as the notes were those Scotch notes, being such peculiar notes, he could not take them for less than 15 per cent.; if they had been English notes he would have transacted business—I told him I had some<lb/>English notes, but I wanted to get rid of the Scotch notes first; and if he would transact business with the Scotch ones he could have the English ones afterwards—we did not come to terms—then we left the house, and I said we would adjourn to Pamphilion's and have a bottle of wine. All four of us went to Pamphilion's—on our way there Froggatt said he thought 15 per cent, was not much to cut up amongst three—I told him I thought 10 per cent., which would be 1,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., was not so bad; and that, according to his ruling, if he</p>

               <p>were to introduce fifty people we should have to pay them propor<lb/>tionately, so as to have equal shares—he said, "Well, we have heard a lot about these notes, but we have not seen anything of them. Have you got one about you?" I said "<hi rend="italic">No."</hi> He said "'I will buy one of them of you. I will give you 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for one"—I told him I could get one—we then went to Pamphilion's—I paid for some wine and left them there—I went to William Kurr, whom I found at the Mitre, Kingsgate Street, Holborn, and got a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Scotch note—I went back with it to Pam<lb/>philloii's, to the private bar—I showed the note to Froggatt; he looked at it—I think we went into one of the dining-rooms or sitting-rooms—after looking at the note he said, "All right," and began' counting out some money—I did not put any name on that—he' handed me 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in Bank of England notes—I told him that that was not the agreement; that 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was what I offered to sell it for—he said that he required 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for expenses in conducting my matter in the City. I told him I did not see that he had moved in the matter at all, but that I was willing he should retain 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was some thing to have in hand, I thought he wanted—he gave me another: 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which made 85<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he gave me credit for would be 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. We had another bottle of wine on that transaction, and then we parted—a great deal more passed with reference to his conduct to me, and I left him with disgust—I think he said that he would give me in charg, but I had one of those notes which I held over him—I saw Kurr next morn<lb/>ing, and I think I gave him 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some time after that I called at Froggatt's office—I had shaved my whiskers and beard off—it was Wednesday, the 22nd, I think, but I have had quite sufficient to <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> it out of my mind since then—Froggatt did not recognise me at first, but when I spoke he started and laughed—I asked him if" he could give me any information' respecting an umbrella and something else which I had lost-when in his." company, and if he had moved in the City matter—he said that it was going on all rig-lit, I had better have taken the offer, and had better see. them again—I said it was of no use, as we refused to give 15 percent.—I asked him what he had done with the note he had from me—he said "Paid it into my bank"—I told him that that was not a very clever. tiling to do—he said, "I don't care, there were no numbers taken of them"—I went then to see William Kurr, and had a conversation with' him, in consequence of which I went to Mr. Savory on 25th November,—at 19, Ledbury Road, Bayswater—I had a conversation with him about changing the notes, and made an appointment to meet him on 27th Nov. at St. Martin's Church—I went there with a Scotch note—Savory lifted His hat, and two police-constables, Robson and Littlechild, arrested me, and took me to a place where Clarke was waiting—I suppose he thought that if I saw him I would not keep the appointment—he charged me with defrauding a lady—I was taken to Marlborough Street and remanded to the following Thursday—Froggatt then appeared for m—he visited me on the Tuesday in the House of Detention—I had sent for him on the Monday—he said, "A nice mess you have got yourself into, trusting to a fellow like Savory, you had better by half have taken our 15 per cent., will you let me have them now? I will get you the money for them"—I told him it was ridiculous to make such a proposition, the first thing I wanted was to get out of my trouble, and we could talk about other business afterwards—he told me he should require</p>

               <p>some money; I said I would see about that, I understood from Stenning that 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was given to him before he appeared for me at the police-court—Froggatt said he had received the money, which made 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. altogether—he appeared for me but did not get me out of my trouble, and from time to time I was remanded—I was identified as the man who had absconded from bail—I received 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Kurr which I had agreed for—I was kept in the House of Detention until I was committed for trial—excepting what I have told you, Froggatt had done nothing for which he could fairly charge—he called in the City once that was all he ever did for me—when I gave him the Clydesdale note it was not agreed that that 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note should be given to him for his costs and expenses.</p>

               <p>right-hand side—it does seem to me that I ought to have looted at the name—I left Froggatt in disgust after the second interview, not making any appointment—with him—I saw him again on, I think, the Wednesday, the day but one after—I was taken in custody on the 27th—my memory is very good for dates when such a thins as that occurs—I have, unfortu<lb/>nately, on two or three occasion made the acquaintance of the police—I do not think Froggatt's mind would compass my case—I do not think mv case puzzled your learned friend Mr. Williams, but I think he could not believe that I was not so guilty as I appeared to be—Froggatt did not seem to trouble himself about the case—I think he was busying himself about other matters, he could get nothing out of it—he appeared—for me before the magistrate, and instructed Mr. Williams and Mr. Grain to appear in my behalf at the police-court time after time—I was remanded 15 times, but a great number of the remands—were merely formal, to await the arrival of the other men from Holland—Froggatt appeared for me about six times—he knew something of the case before I was apprehended, or I should not have sent for him—I gave him several written instructions, and handed them to him in the House of Detention—I very likely told him, as counsel's instructions, that the note for which I was arrested was one of 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which I had received in payment of a bet—I gave him him a lot of instructions for him to use his professional ability to see which would get me out of the difficulty best—they were all false—if I had given him truthful instructions I might as well have pleaded guilty—I told him that Mr. Carson, of Liverpool, had bet me 500 to 5 on Footstep; it is a bit of amusement to write instructions while you are waiting—I said "The horse won, and on my asking him to pay me he said he would not until he received his money "—that was a tale I wrote as it might get me out of trouble—it was all—false—I wrote a letter to the Waverley Hotel to a fictitious person, Mr. Sampson—I instructed him also that on returning to London and seeing Carson he paid me the money in 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Clydesdale bank-notes, and that he had asked me to address him in future as Mr. C. Sampson, Waverley Hotel, Edinburgh—that was to account for the letter I had sent—I thought the letter would be found there, and nobody would call for it—it required explanation why I wrote such a letter there—finding a difficulty I wrote to that address and received no reply—I used the name of Wells in changing the notes because I knew I had done something wrong in changing the cheque—I said "Neither did any of the people where the offices were held know me"—part of the instructions I gave him were true and part false; it was a conglomeration, I thought if I made up something false with the true it would be best, because none of the people at the different lodgings knew me—I wrote "I contradict Savory's statement entirely," and "It is all imagination about paying part proceeds of the said swindle;" but I knew different—those instructions are in my writing—in 1871 I had offices in Edinburgh—I have been living rather dishonestly for the last seven years, but not the whole time—I have been racing and paying—I have been connected with five or six racing swindles, not mixed up with Kurr in any business transactions, but in fraudulent transactions I was mixed up with him from 1867 to 1872—after absconding from my bail in the Walters and Murray fraud I went to America with Walters and started as a land surveyor—I surveyed land for people who wished to borrow money, I and Walters—that was a</p>

               <p>swindle—it was done in this way: Walters was advertised as an English gentleman wishing to lend money on landed property; when people applied to him for a loan he would refer them to his surveyor, that <hi rend="italic">nt me</hi>; I surveyed the land, and as a great number of them were trying to cheat the English gentleman of his superfluous capital I used my discre<lb/>tion and proposed in certain cases that they should victimise the English gentleman by giving me a consideration, for which I would make a favourable report of plots of land, and so deceive "Walters; Wallers never lent any money; I used to receive my payment from the people who wished to borrow, and when they applied to him he used to say that the report from the surveyor was satisfactory, but that as collateral security is was necessary that they should insure their lives; I was the insurauce agent also—that scheme did not last long, but I should think we made about 400 dollars a day—the Americans did not soon find out the decep<lb/>tion—they have not found it out yet that I know of—I was arrested on a charge of smuggling—we underwent some amount of whitewashing, I suppose, for we were acquitted by a jury, and discharged without a stain upon our characters—we did not carry it on because I thought I had something better on hand—I started a pocket-book company, which was another swindle—we advertised that we had bought a great number of pocket-books very cheap, and were willing to let the American public have the benefit of the barga n. and that to those who would pay so much for a pocket-book we would give half the profits, to be distributed to the holders of coupons—we did nor. make anything out of that, but the Post Office did, for they stopped the letters, it being a lottery—I remained in America about a month after that, during which time I was driving about and enjoying myself—I then came back to England, and have been racing; ever since—that is my life for 1870.</p>

James Ingham, at Bow Street, last September, and being cross examine I by Mr. Froggatt, and saying that I believed he was not present when I drew the plan—I am sure he was not—I also said that if either of his clerks attempted to look at me, I held my hat in such a manner that he could not see it—when I was standing in the body of the court, being hand<lb/>cuffed, Froggatt said to me "Shall I <hi rend="italic">square</hi> the <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> for you?"—the <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> is a term applied to the officers, of the House of Correction, and I suppose other prisons as well—they are turnkeys, so I suppose they are all "screws"—I said You had better not"—he said "Then I shall send your wife two <hi rend="italic">quid for</hi> what you have said to-day"—when the deposi<lb/>tions were being read over I was asked what Froggatt had said—I then stated to the court what I have now stated to you—upon that Mr. Frog<lb/>gatt made a statement—I think he said that that day he had lost his mother, mi that his mind was in such a state that he really did not understand hat he had said; he also said, I believe, "On the occasion I made that remark I believe I also attacked Mr. Pollard outside the Court."</p>

Abrahams and Boffey to give evidence, but that he did not like to be mixed up in a criminal prosecution; that he had not the slightest idea that the solicitors at Kotterdam had anything to do with it, and that he should not say more against Kurr than he possibly could—I reported what I have repeated at Bow Street Police Court.</p>

I am a widow, residing at 15, Clifton Road, Clapton—I have known Benson since July, 1873—it must have been four years ago last July—I was asked by his aunt and uncle if I would take him as a lodger—I was then living at Helena Road, Dalston—at that time he was quite unable to help himself, and had to be carried up and down stairs—I was married, and my husband was then alive—Benson lodged with us as near as I can remember eighteen months—I knew Kurt by the name of Medway, coining to call on Benson—Benson told me he came there through an advertisement—when we left Helena Road I went to Paradise Terrace—Benson went with me there—he also went with us to Caw ley Road—he did not take the honse himself at first, but he took it off our hands—it was a more expensive house than we could well afford—Benson had a servant named Picard about July or the beginning of August, 1874—my husband died in December, 1874—on 15th January, 1875, Benson went to Shanldin, in the Isle of Wight—his servant and I went to <hi rend="italic">get the</hi> place ready for him—he was then better, but not able to walk—I stayed as his housekeeper at Rose Bank till 15th July, 1875, and saw Clarke twice: I saw him going out, he was taking a stick or umbrella out of the stand, and I saw him leaving the house—I had not seen him come in—I can't say how long it was between the two visits, it may have been a week or two weeks—Benson asked me to copy some letters for him—I did so—I kept some of the drafts, and some I destroyed—the last four I wrote I kept <hi rend="italic">the</hi> drafts of—the first drafts I copied I burnt, perhaps four or five of them—Benson wrote them—these are the ones I kept—I posted some of them myself, to "George Clarke, Esq., 20, Great College Street, Westminster"—Benson gave me the address—these are dated June 15th, 17th, 20th, and 24th—I have the paper here—I have seen a Mr. Andrews at Rose Bank frequently—I saw Medway once on the lawn, and I think he had been there before, but I was in London at the time—Benson was not aware in the slightest degree that I kept the drafts.</p>

I reside at 28, Grosvenor Road, Stoke Newington—last year I let apartments in my house to a person named Benson, who went by the name of Yonge—a gentleman named Murray took the apartments for him—Yonge came to live there on the 3rd of August, 1876, and remained a week, leaving on the 10th—the convict W. Kurr daily came to the house while Benson was there—sometimes Murray came with him, and sometimes Kurr came alone—Benson's secretary also came, I do not know his name—I did not receive a letter from Benson after he left.</p>

He said "Damn the turf swindle! I wish I had never heard anything of it." He then added "I hare documents in my hand with which I could amash two"—just before he said this I had said "I believe there is some one else in it besides Meiklejohn"—then he made the remark about the documents—I then said "Have you told the Governor so?"

I said "What missing letter?" He said "Don't you know?" I said "No, I do not know what you are alluding to?"

I knew that Clarke was in charge of the Walters and Murray case—I do not know the O'Regan case—I knew generally that Clarke for years had charge of the betting cases, the Turf Fraud cases, and I should think he was pretty notorious, not only in the force, but among the betting people themselves—he was constantly appearing at the police-courts in such cases—when police inspectors are on leave and going about on their own pleasure, they are in the habit of getting railway passes given them by the authorities of the different railways—in the course of their official duty they constantly come into contact with the authorities of railway companies, and when out on then" own pleasure make their expenses lighter in that way.</p>

When Greenham came, in all probability he explained who he was; he must have had a list of the notes he wanted stopped, for this reason, that he would put the particulars of the notes he was desirous of stopping on another slip of paper—if some of the notes had been returned to the bank, we should not stop them—it might so happen that they might be put down in error—I can't say whether some of the notes which Greenham had on his list had already been paid in, I should imagine so from this entry—the entry is "Nos. 58359—68 and 58,777 were stopped in error, those notes having been already paid in"—that is simply a footnote—that leads me to suppose that certain of the notes on his list had been paid in, I mean had been, returned to the bank—I cannot say now from whence they had come; it could be ascertained very easily, but that is in a different department—we should simply know the names of the bankers or the persons who paid them in—that entry might or might not show whether they came from the Clydesdale Bank—I can't say when it would be discovered that the notes had been paid in—I should imagine very shortly afterwards by this entry—the person would merely say "Don't trouble yourself about those, they have been paid in"—when I say "stopped in error," perhaps that is a wrong expression, I mean they may already have been paid in—it does not necessarily mean that they had been paid to the knowledge of the persons stopping them—it might have been so, I can't say, or it might be an error on our side, not knowing they had been paid in, I am not in a position to say.</p>

               <p>Yard—on the 3rd October, 1876, a letter was written by me, dictated by Chief Inspector Druscovich, to Mr. P.

There were the following Bank of England notes (<hi rend="italic">numbers and amounts specified</hi>). These notes have been paid into the Bank of England by Messrs.

"Will you be good enough to inquire as to the source from which the notes emanated, and inform me of the result at your convenience? Upon the receipt of a telegram from you I will at once send down an officer. (Signed) G. Clarke." (<hi rend="italic">The numbers of the notes were attached to the letter.</hi>) That letter was copied into the letter-book of the office by me—there was one more letter copied by me on that day—it was a letter about the You Howard case—the latest time at which those letters could be copied was sis o'clock, if they were dispatched that night—letters are generally sent on the same day on which they are written—there is an office diary—it is kept by Sergeant Neale—the letters were put into the bag for the post at a quarter to six—if they are not put into the bag then they would not be dispatched at six o'clock—I cannot remember the time at which the letter to Superintendent Browne was written—I can only say that I wrote it in the afternoon at the dictation of Inspector Druscovich, and it was copied—to the best of my belief Chief Inspector Clarke was present in the office at the time—on the 26th October a letter was received at the office—I believe Druscovich was in charge on that day—this is the letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—from this memorandum I conclude that Druscovich was in charge on 26th October; it would then be his duty to open all the letters and attend to them.</p>

The entry-book and the diary would show who was the Chief Inspector on duty—the Chief Inspector has himself to sign the book showing that he was on duty—sometimes an inspector might wish to send a letter, and he would make a rough draft and I should copy it from that—that would be copied into the book as well—there were only two letters written on 3rd October—I don't always write the letters—I can say that I wrote the one that was sent to Glasgow—I have to keep the various books in the office and to attend to the correspondence and reports which are received—I cannot recollect sending a telegram to Macnab at Glasgow for Druscovich—I have some recollection of a telegram being sent to the chief of the police there, but I can't say that I sent it; I don't recollect sending it.</p>

When Druscovich dictated the letter Mr. Clarke was sitting in his usual place—Druscovich spoke aloud, so that any one in the office could hear him—after it was written I should lav it before Mr. Clarke in the ordinary course—he usually reads the letters—he might not have read this one, as he was there and heard it—if he had not heard it it would have been his business to read it—I say that Druscovich was in charge of the office on the 26th of October from this memorandum, it is my writing—it is his signature—the memorandum is "Detective Department, 26th October, 1876. Memorandum. The attached letter was received yesterday evening." Then that is signed "N. Druscovich, Chief Inspector for Superintendent." From that I can say that he was in charge that day—I do not keep the diary, Sergeant Neale does that.</p>

I am a clerk in the office at Scotland Yard, and was so in October, 1876—Henry Wilson is my fellow-clerk—we were the only two clerks in the office in October, 1876—I heard a talk about a letter being missing—I opened no letter on 26th October—I did not open a letter from the Police-office at Leeds referring to the cashing of a Clydesdale bank-note in Leeds—we keep a diary, it is my duty to keep it—the 26th October was Thursday—on that day Druscovich was attendance officer in the morning—there is an entry in this other book, called the entry-book, in my writing, which shows that Druscovich was there attending the office that morning—Mr. Clarke would have been in charge that morning, only he was at the Central Criminal Court on Von Howard's trial; when he returned from that he would resume charge of the office; it was the second or third day of Von Howard's trial, I think the morning of his sentence—he was convicted of some fraud.</p>

I live at 8, Northumberland Street, Strand, and have been there about a year and a half—last August I let my offices to a firm who called themselves Brooks and Co., of Glasgow—they were taken by a person calling himself Chapman, who I afterwards found to be Frederick Kurr—the arrangement was made on 30th August, 1876, and the—agreement signed on 31st August, about 9 o'clock in the morning Benson, Frederick Kurr, William Kurr, Bale, and myself were present, but no one else—when they took possession we were asked to supply them with furniture, and they stayed there till about half-past five in the evening—I saw them all four <hi rend="italic">from</hi> time to time during the day—they commenced business about 9 30 a.m, but being the first day I did not, take so much notice as afterwards what their hours were—I was residing there all the time—I believed it to be an advertising agency—I had not the slightest notion what was going on until three months after they left the premises—I saw no correspondence connected with the offices by Benson and Kurr—Benson came in a brougham and was taken away in a brougham, and another time in a cab—I saw quantities of letters go by the post, but I only recollect one letter coming all the time they were there—they left on 26th September, about 2.30 p.m.—I had no notice that they were going to leave—on 30th December I went to Marlborough Street Police-court, and swore an information in the magistrate's private room, and on the next night I was taken to the police station at Islington</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220197"/>
               <p>and found "William Kurr there—I identified Mm without the slightest doubt—on January 1, about ten minutes before Wo, I went to Marl-borough Street Police-court, and while I was standing at the door Stenning and Froggatt approached me, Stenning walked on—Froggatt re<lb/>mained in the front of the Court and made a signal that he wished to speak—I had seen Stenning at about 11 o'clock the same morning, and had had a conversation which resulted in my going to Scotland Yard, and also to the Treasury—Froggatt told me that he knew I was a witness about to give evidence in the case of Kurr, who had been apprehended on the Sunday previous, but he was a good fellow, that he was a Freemason in distress, and he asked me to assist him—I was a Freemason—I told him that Freemasonry was not intended to assist persons of that description, and that I could have nothing whatever to do with him—Froggatt said that he wished me to state that Kurr, whom I had identified the night before, was the wrong man—I told him that Kurr being a very tall man, and rather remarkable in appearance, whom I had seen from day to day for nearly a month, it was almost an impossibility to make a mistake; that Stenning had asked me at 11 o'clock that same morning to do the same thing, and had offered me any reasonable amount of money if I would do so; that I had declined his offer, and had communicated what had taken place to the Detective Department at Scotland Yard, and that I had been sent from Scotland Yard to the Treasury to state what had occurred there also—he said "Oh, never mind that, he is a good fellow, you must try and help him"—this conversation was in the street, a few yards from the doors of the police-court—just at that juncture Mr. Abrahams, a solicitor, passed with Superintendent Williamson—I followed Mr. Abrahams immediately into the Court, and Froggatt came after us—before I saw Mr. Abrahams and Mr. Williamson, Froggatt had asked me to accompany him to his office in Argyle Street—I said to him "I can go to no office, I do not even <hi rend="italic">how</hi> who you are"—I never asked him his name, I had never seen him before—before he followed me into the Court he told me he would pay me' money to comply with his request, but mentioned no specific sum then—when he followed me into the Court the magistrate had not arrived, and he laid hold of my shoulder, and said "I want to speak to you, come along this passage;" that passage I afterwards found led from the Court to the gaoler's room, and the cells connected with the police-court—in that passage he said "I have instructed George Lewis to defend Kurr, let me go and tell him that you cannot identify Kurr, and for doing this I will give you 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "This is impossible," and I left him and went into the Court—I saw Mr. Froggatt in conversation with Mr. George Lewis, and before Kurr had been brought into the dock, Mr. Lewis stated to the Magistrate that Kurr, he believed, had not been identified, and he wished to know whether it was so or not—the magistrate said "Let the prisoner to brought in, and we will see whether he can be identified"—Kurr was then brought in and I at once identified him—during the evidence given by the officers as to the time and. mode of Kurr's arrest, one of them stated that an attempt at rescue had been made by a person then in court, sitting immediately behind the prisoner in the dock—Mr. Newton, the magistrate, ordered him to sit on one side until he had heard the case out—ultimately Stenning was taken in charge, and evidence was given against him about his interview with me in the morning, and attempting to bribe me—afterwards a representation was made</p>

               <p>against me by Mr. Froggatt—I was before the magistrate four or five times, but was never asked a single question as to money being offered—on none of these occasions did Mr. Froggatt ever suggest anything of the kind—I was afterwards examined as a witness against Stenning; I believe Mr. Froggatt appeared for him at the police-court, but am not quite sure—I know that no such question as that was ever suggested against me, or put to me in cross-examination—after I had given evidence against Stenning, and after his conviction, I was served with a summons charging me with perjury—this is the summons dated 9th February—I appeared in pursuance of that summons—the case was before the magistrate on two occasions—on the first occasion Mr. Montagu Williams opened the case, and when he had done so it was adjourned till the following Wednesday, or about six days after, and the case was dismissed.</p>

I have heard the evidence read which I heard given against me by Froggatt—there is not a single word of truth in the suggestion that I sent my wife to him, nor in the evidence which has been read, from beginning to end, except the fact that we did meet in the street; and I should never have spoken at all, but he took an advantage, and gave me a masonic sign—I treat the notion with utter contempt.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. COLLINS</hi>. I first knew that the gentleman I was speaking to was Mr. Froggatt when I went into the Court and Mr. Abra<lb/>hams told me so—I never asked him his name—I never said that at the door of the Marlborough Street Police Court Stenning introduced me to Mr. Froggatt—Stenning did not speak, but slunk away like a dog—I saw Stenning on two occasions, first, when he passed up the street, and saw me standing there, he went up Argyle Street, and in ten minutes he came down again accompanied by another person, whom I afterwards found out to be Froggatt, and who came to the Court door—Stenning had pre<lb/>yiously seen me; he walked on; Froggatt beckoned to me, and said he wanted to speak to me—he was introduced to me in the way I have described—Stenning never opened his mouth to me about Froggatt—I told Froggatt that Stenning had been to me, and I had been to Scotland Yard an hour and a half afterwards, and also to the Treasury—after that he offered me 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was in a passage—I walked in at the door a couple of yards, and when I found what he was proposing to do I came out far quicker than I went in—I did not go into the cells, but into the passage—I heard Mr. Froggatt give his account of what took place with regard to the masonic sign—every word of it was false—I did not know a word about him when he made me this offer—I did not ask Stenning his name, or him either—I would not waste time with a man who tried to tempt me to do such a dishonourable thing—when Mr. Abrahams told me his</p>

               <p>name, he told me also that he had rebuked him for tampering with his client, and Mr. Froggatt denied it—it was, perhaps, half an hour after I vent into Court before I knew what his name was—I did not see Mr. Lewis at the time I was talking to Froggatt—I was cross-examined once, I think, at Bow Street; Mr. Williams cross-examined me in Stenning's case—I was also cross-examined by Mr. Serjeant Parry at the trial of Benson and Kurr—it was not about the alleged interview with me and Mr. Froggatt (<hi rend="italic">The witness's deposition was read to him</hi>)—on the 10th, when. I was further examined, I said "I did not know Mr. Froggatt before I was introduced to him"—the prisoner (that is, Henry Stenning) said to him, "This is Mr. Flintoff"—I was introduced in that name—I did not know Froggatt's name; I did not know who he was—Stenning spoke in a loud tone to somebody who I afterwards found to be Froggatt—Sten<lb/>ning did not say a word to me—I said it was my usage as a professional man to ask for a fee before I entered upon any duty whatever—I was not alluding particularly to the case; I was alluding to my practice as an engineer—at the trial of Stenning I said "I do not walk outside my door without something to fall back upon; I should require 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to come out<lb/>side my door to see you"—I <hi rend="italic">very likely</hi> said "I did not care a straw about furthering the ends of justice, and do not now"—that was because I knew that justice would take care of itself; it had done so before our time, and would after—I have read the reports and find them very imper<lb/>fect—I never said that I was entitled to something, or "I live in hopes"—I sent in a bill to Messrs. Abrahams for expenses, 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 36<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I was paid a guinea a day for my time and what I spent—my expenses were 22<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., so I did not get much out of it—I have to eat and drink as you have, and live and pay travelling expenses;. besides, I had to be carried into Court on the backs of persons, because I was suffering from gout—I was paid 34<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—neither I nor my wife or family have ever received one farthing for this trial—about six weeks after Benson and his party had left, someone came to the door of my place and asked if I had heard any<lb/>thing about Brooks and Co.—I said "I have made several inquiries about them"—he said "Yes, it is a pity to give you trouble; I will leave you a sovereign to drink Brooks' health"—I took it—I have been an engineer and lectured on gas-lighting since 3rd October, 1851—I was not connected with the Eupion Company, or any speculative gas compa<lb/>nies—I formed the Sheffield Company in 1861—I have lectured in 200 towns in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and have never offended against the laws of my country—the only case against me was in the carrying out of this scheme, in which I lost my money—I was bankrupt in Ply-mouth in 1863, but did no dishonourable conduct—it is a very respect-able thing to be bankrupt—my liabilities were not 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—<hi rend="italic">if you show</hi> any dishonourable conduct on my part, it does not matter to me—I never tad 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property put into a room for me—I have not been a bankrupt ten or twelve times, nor yet three times—I have been a bankrupt or liquidated in 1845, 1850, 1859, 1864, 1867, 1871, and 1872—I was arrested for a debt in 1859, but I never in my life made an assign<lb/>ment for the benefit of my creditors—when I was bankrupt in 1864 I did not owe a shilling—I made a composition in 1866, because the last bank<lb/>ruptcy was done improperly—I have compounded twice; I cannot tell you the dates—I have done all that the law required—I had 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. liabilities, and my creditors met and agreed to a composition, and it was paid—that</p>

Meet me at Derby"—when I handed that telegram to Meiklejohn I said, "Here is a telegram from Gifford—who</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police-constable stationed at Bridge of Allan—I remember Druscovich calling upon me about four o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the 11th of November last—he said he had come from Edinburgh—he told me there had been a fraud committed in Lon<lb/>don, and mentioned the name of Jackson in connection with it—lie gave me a description of the person who had committed the fraud—he said he was a lame man, walking with two sticks, and was about thirty-five rears of age—he also told me that he had already made inquiries at all the hotels in the place, but could get no information; and I suggested that he should make inquiries at the hydropathic establishment and other places—on the Saturday I myself went and made some inquiries from the man at the station, and obtained certain information from him—Drusco<lb/>vich had not asked me to do so—I afterwards went with the station-master and communicated to Druscovich the information I had receivedhe was in bed at the time we called; but we roused him, and he got up—we told him that a man answering the description he had given had been seen at the station along with Meiklejohn; and that some telegraphic mes<lb/>sages had Passed between the perpetrators of the fraud and the police officers in Glasgow—he did not appear to take much notice of it—he did not say whether the son-in-law of the landlord of the Lady of the Lake hotel had told him anything—he did not say whether he had learned anything about the Scotch notes—I suggested that he should go to Green Loaming, but he said he did not think that it would be of any use—I saw him on the Monday morning, and he said he was going on to Perth—I saw him on his return, when he was passing through the railway station—he then said he felt certain that the parties he was in search of had been at the Bridge of Allan.</p>

               <p>me about four o'clock in the afternoon—I went into a public-house with him and M'Nab—he did not pull out of his pocket a printed report of the information upon which the warrants had been granted, and read the names and descriptions of the parties—he did not show me the informa<lb/>tion he mentioned semething about having warrants, and said he would show them to me at some other time, but he did not—he said first of all that he thought the people he was in search of had been stopping at the Queen's Hotel, but after making inquiries he did not think they had been there—he also said he was under the impression that the man he wanted might be at the hydropathic establishment—Druscovich appeared to be very tired; he complained of illness and fatigue—I remember on the Saturday afternoon Druscovich, M'Nab, and myself going to the hydro<lb/>pathic establishment—we inquired for a man of the name of Jackson—we ascertained that he had been staying there for a couple of days, but had left suddenly on the Wednesday previously, without taking his luggage with him—the proprietor of the hydropathic establishment declined to allow us to see the luggage until the next day—that evening Drus Covich said to me "You had better be careful how you make in<lb/>quiries "—there was an officer in our force named Campbell, the chief constable—Campbell is also the name of the station-master, and he was to be used for the purpose of making inquiries—on the Sunday morning I saw Druscovich, and I went to the hydropathic establishment with him—the proprietor said that he could not show us the luggage then as all his lodgers were about, but that if we called at seven o'clock the next morn<lb/>ing we should see it—on Sunday night Campbell, the station-master, said he thought that two of the people we wanted had gone north—I know that M'Nab and Druscovich went to Stirling that afternoon; the distance is about three miles—they returned at" about eight o'clock in the evening—that evening Druscovich was informed in my presence that two of the parties he was in search of had taken tickets for Perth at 10.20 on the Friday night, and that one of them went south the same evening—I remember some conversation about their having gone south—I heard Campbell say he was sure they had not, but they might by an early train in the morning—at eight o'clock on the morning of the 13th I think I went to the hydropathic establishment with M'Nab and Druscovich—I think Druscovich told me so later in the day—if the person came back for his luggage I was to be immediately informed—I'don't think I went to see the 7.40 a.m. train for the south, stop at the Bridge of Allan station on Monday morning—Druscovich went to Perth between two and three o'clock—he came to me when I was in bed at my own house—I do not remember his telling me to telegraph to him at the Police Chambers, Edinburgh, if anything further transpired—I received a telegram from Him in the fore part of the Tuesday—I have not got it, I think it was destroyed—I had telegraphed to him that the man Jackson was a spirit merchant, of Glasgow, and that his family was respectable—he telegraphed back to me to make further inquiries about Jackson, and telegraph back—I saw Druscovich again on Wednesday, the 13th, between ten and eleven o'clock, and he left on the next morning—I do not know where for.</p>

               <p>I went with him to the Lady of the Lake Hotel, and there found Drusco<lb/>vich—no inquiries were made to me about Druscovich previous to that—it was about ten o'clock; Druscovich was in bed; we had some difficulty in rousing him—he got up, but did not dress—I told him that I had found out from inquiries that I had seen Meiklejohn on Monday, the 6th, with the convicts Kurr and Benson—I called them Gifford and Yonge—the reason I knew Yonge was, I was at the hotel, and it was through a gentleman losing his box between King's Cross and Bridge of Allan—I told this to Druscovich, and that they came on the 3rd—I said "Mr. Anderson, of the Queen's Hotel, has been making inquiries about the box, and asking my advice as to how we should recover it"—I told him that I had seen them twice with Meiklejohn, at the hotel and on the following morning—I told Druscovich on the Sunday night that from the fact of Meiklejohn being in Yonge's company. through Yonge's descrip<lb/>tion, which was given in the <hi rend="italic">Evening Citizen</hi> of November 9, I believed he was the same party—the <hi rend="italic">Evening Citizen</hi> is a Glasgow paper, which had a description of this man who every one was looking for—I had seen it, and told Druscovich that, from the description, I believed he was the man—I told him they had dispatched two telegrams; Meiklejohn came into the office with them, and asked for two message-forms, which they were provided with—I don't recollect whether I told him to whom they had sent the telegrams on those forms; I told him they had used them—copies of the messages were kept at the station until they were dispatched to the post-office—on the Sunday night and on Monday, the 13th, they were at the station, and could have been seen—I saw Druscovich on the Monday morning at half-past seven, and said I had traced two parties having booked by the late train and proceeded on the Friday night to Perth with a first and second-class ticket, being the same train as Benson and his servant trave led by to Bridge of Allan, and I believed they were the same parties, as they were the only two passengers that night by that train—I did not see the other man—previous to seeing Drus<lb/>covich on the Sunday night I had made inquiries of the waiter of the Queen's Hotel about the box—he said he had heard they had driven to Dumblane, and had dined there on the Sunday—I told this to Drusco<lb/>vich, and advised him to go to Green Loaming—he said "That is of no use, that is no good"—he told me on the Sunday that he purposed going to Edinburgh, and he asked to see me on the Monday morning—I recommended him on the Monday morning to go to Mr. Anderson—I afterwards saw him at the railway-station, and after he had been to Mr. Anderson he said he could get no information—after that, on the Monday, he went to Perth and returned the same day—he left Perth by the 5.55 train and arrived at Bridge of Allan about twelve—he saw me at the station when he came back, and said he had traced the parties to Perth and no farther—I don't think anything more was said about the tele<lb/>grams that had been sent—I know the address to which they had been sent, but I don't recollect if I told him—I haven't got a copy of the telegrams—I saw him again on Wednesday, 15th November—in the course of conversation he said that he had got the letters that were lying at the Queen's Hotel—I said that it was curious that swindlers could so easily get away in one day; they left on the Friday night, and he came on the Saturday—he remarked "This is not the first place that has been done at;" then I <hi rend="italic">said "</hi> Has it not occurred to you that Meikle</p>

The superior officers of the lodge occupy chairs—Palmer was one of the three superior officers—this (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) is the summons for the meeting of November 10th—Mr. Abrahams, a member of a Scotch lodge, joined that evening—before a member of a Scotch lodge could be ballotted for in an English lodge it is necessary that there should be a certificate of his membership, showing that he is clear of all arrears in the Scotch lodge—my impression is Palmer was present at the opening of the lodge and before the balloting—the members would be in evening dress—three sections were worked before the banquet, one by Brother Foxcroft and two by Brother White—the balloting would take place between half-past 4 and 5, and working sections would fill up the intervening time before the banquet, with the exception of a quarter of an hour for washing hands, &amp;c.—at the banquet Palmer would occupy a particular seat—he would have duties to perform up to 10 o'clock—I do not know anything to the contrary that he was there the whole time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the head of the detective department of the Edinburgh police—I know Druscovich—I have been acquainted with him about two years—I remember his coming to Edinburgh on the morning; of November 11th last, to make inquiries as to the turf fraud—before his arrival I had received a telegram from Superintendent Williamson—I re<lb/>member getting to the police-office on the morning of Saturday, 11th of November, about half-past nine o'clock in the morning—I did not find Druscovich there; but I heard that he had called—he came back shortly before eleven o'clock—a telegram had arrived for him by that time, and 1 gave it to him—we had then some conversation about certain papers which I had recovered in relation to the frauds—by this time M. Nab, the cabman, had arrived from Glasgow; and Druscovich left with him and was absent about three-quarters of an hour—Druscovich quitted Edinburgh at twenty minutes past one o'clock that day for, as I under<lb/>stood, the Bridge of Allan—there was only one other train by which he</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220213"/>
               <p>could have gone before that time—he left the police-office with M. Nab, and that time he actually proceeded to the Bridge of Allan—in the fore<lb/>noon we looked over what had been recovered; over cheque plates, plates for stamping letter paper, letters, and telegrams—we then went to Bry<lb/>done the printer's office, and Druscovich asked him certain questions re<lb/>lating to the matter—then we went to the Waverley Hotel, and asked some questions as to parties connected with the fraud who were supposed to have been staying there—Druscovich afterwards left for the Bridge of Allan—in the evening I received this telegram from him—it is dated November 11, 1876. "Shall remain here all night, and probably all day to-morrow. Forward anything you may receive. No success yet." I received a second telegram from the Bridge of Allan, dated November 13, as follows:—"Parties have been staying here, but left on Friday. One to south and two to north. Am going to Perth and Green Loaming. Keep my telegrams. Hope to be in Edinburgh to-night." On that evening Druscovich came to Edinburgh—he told me that he had found a' man of the name of Yonge staying at the hydropathic establishment, Bridge of Allan, and that at first he thought he was the man he wanted, but ultimately it transpired that he was a merchant of Glasgow—Druso<lb/>vich stayed in Edinburgh that night and all day on Tuesday, as well as on Tuesday night—on the Wednesday he told me he was going to Glas<lb/>gow—on Thursday he returned, and went to see Brydone again; but we found the office shut—I believe Brydone went away on the Wednesday evening—I spoke to Druscovich about Meiklejohn—the Scotch newspapers on Wednesday in that week contained an account of the dinner at Dumblane; and, when Druscovich returned on the Thursday, I asked him if he had heard of it, it seemed a strange affair—he said he could not understand it—on Friday the matter was reported to the Sheriff, and Druscovich and I went to the Sheriff's office to see if any inquiries were to be made about it—on Tuesday evening, the 14th. November, I saw Druscovich and Meiklejohn together—I went back with Druscovich to his hotel that evening, and when we arrived we were told that a gentleman was waiting to see him—the gentleman turned out to be Meiklejohn—we had some general conversation, and Meiklejohn said that he had come down on railway business—I left them together—I did not hear anything pass between them about the visit to the Bridge of Allan, or the Dumblane dinner—I wrote to Druscovich on the 18th November—I have not a copy of that letter; but I can tell you from re<lb/>collection the contents of it—a communication had come from London on the Wednesday morning, while he was away in Glasgow; and I forwarded it to him at the central office in Glasgow, where he had directed me to send any letters or telegrams addressed to him—I had already sent there two telegrams and a letter which had come to hand, to him—I believed he had got them in Glasgow, but they were returned to me on Saturday morning from Glasgow—the letter I wrote to him enclosed the communi<lb/>cation sent from London; and I returned it to him to London—the telegrams I did not send, because they were useless then—the detective superintendent at Glasgow had sent the letter and telegram back to me in Edinburgh, as they had not been called for—I had understood from Druscovich that he was going to Glasgow—when I saw him on the Thursday he did not tell me whether he had been there—in my letter to him I expressed my astonishment at having it</p>

               <p>returned, as I expected that he had got it in Glasgow—I noticed his eye was bruised when he came back to Edinburgh, us, I suppose, from Glasgow, he had a black eye in fact—he said he hud fallen asleep in a rail<lb/>way carriage, and fell against the window—I came up to London in January, when the convicts were remanded at the police-court, and Drus<lb/>covich said Meiklejohn had sent in a report which was not satisfactory—I saw Mr. Froggatt one day when Druscovich and I went from Marl<lb/>borough Street police-court; we met him by the Charing Cross railway station; and Druscovich introduced me to him and said he was the solicitor for the defence—Froggatt asked me if I had ever been a witness at the Old Bailey—I said—'No"—he said cross-examination was a very terrible thing, but ho would take care to let me off—he added that he did not see how they could prove the charge—this conversation <hi rend="italic">was</hi> at the Charing Cross station.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. Previous to November 11th I had only seen Druscovich once, that was when he came to Edinburgh to make some inquiries, I think in 1875—he had called at the office in the morn<lb/>ing, on 11th November last year, before I got there—the Midland train from the south would arrive at about eight in the morning, and I presume he must have come direct from the train—so that if he had left London the night before, he must have gone through, and could not have stopped at Derby—when I saw him, between half-past nine and ten o'clock, it would be too late to catch the train for Bridge of Allan—prior to his leaving for Bridge of Allan he went over the papers in my hands—then he went to Brydone's, the printer's, where ho remained half an hour or more—Brydone had previously informed mo that he expected the persons to come about the <hi rend="italic">Racing News</hi> that day—M. Nabb was put at a window on the opposite side of the street, where he could command a view of all persons who came by—we then went to the Waverley Hotel, and made inquiries about three men who had been staying there, one of whom had given the name of Wilson, the others gave no names—we did not find the men there, but we found they had been there—we do not generally ex<lb/>pect to find people who are wanted for crimes, at places where they have been just before—I received a letter from Superintendent Williamson on the morning of November 9th, enclosing a cheque and asking me to make inquiries at the Stamp Office to see if it was stamped in Edinburgh—that letter was the basis of certain inquiries which led me to Brydone, and which resulted in the discovery of the printing of these cheques and of the newspapers—after Saturday, the 11th, I next saw Druscovich on the following Monday evening—I had a telegram from Mr. Williamson before Druscovich came on the llth, instructing mo that Druscovich was to be there, and I was to have M. Nabb there to meet him—I saw Drusco<lb/>vich on the Monday, about eight o'clock, at the office; he told me he was going to Perth and Green Loaming—he did not say that ho had been there—on the 17th I remember making inquiries with him about a servant of Yongo who was to have been engaged, but was not—I think I saw Brydone again on the 17th—Druscovich said that ho thought he</p>

               <p>would go back to London, as nothing was left to inquire about—he did not ask me to go and see Meiklejohn, he asked me to <hi rend="italic">go to</hi> his hotel—during the time that Druscovich was with me at Edinburgh he appeared, as far as I could judge, to be endeavouring to gain information in the case in which he was engaged.</p>

I was formerly a sergeant in the detective police—in December last I was making inquiries about a man who lived at 29, Marquess Road, Canonbury, who I now know to be the convict Wm. Kurr—I saw Mr. Froggatt come out of the house—no one was with him—it was about a quarter to one in the day, on Thursday, 20th Dec.—I had not seen him that day before he spoke to me—he said "Hallo Funnell, what are you doing up here; do you live up this way?" I said "Yes." He said "You have left the. police have not you?" I said "Yes." He said, "I was told so." At that moment I saw a person getting up into a gig, which was standing opposite Kurr's gateway—I said to Froggatt "Who is that man getting up into that trap." He said "Oh, that is <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Smith, the trotting<lb/>man, who is going to give me a spin round." I did not see where the man came from who got into the trap—I have no doubt it was Kurr—Froggatt asked me to call at his office next day; he perhaps could give me a job—I asked him what time—he said eleven o'clock, and I was there at eleven o'clock—I waited till four o'clock, and did not see anything of him—I next saw him on Satur<lb/>day morning, and said "You did not keep me waiting long yesterday; the whole day." He said "I could not help it; just give me one of your cards, will you?" I gave him one of my cards and he wished me good day—he said there were several people waiting for him—I did not see him with any one else that day—I saw him a week afterwards at the Pamphilion in Argyll Street, that is a cafe—he said he could not speak to me then, I had told him a lie and he did not like lies—I asked him in what way I had told him a lie—he said "I will bet you a sovereign you did tell me a lie"—I said "Done; "he said "You told me that day that I saw you that you were living in Marquess Road." I said "So I do." He said "You do not." I said "Yes, I do, I have beat the sovereign," and he said "You gave me one of your cards."—I said we both lived there when we were speaking together. He said he would not stand that, there was no bet. He said, "You told me it was <hi rend="italic">Jack</hi> Smith the trotting man, and now you tell me it is <hi rend="italic">Billy</hi> Smith the trotting man."—That was the end of the conversation.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This being read stated that a person named Andrews had called on him at the request of Yonge, who was able to give important informa<lb/>tion, but was unable to move, as he was suffering from the effects of a railway accident, offering </hi>5<hi rend="italic">l. to pay his expenses, which he, Clarke, declined. A fur<lb/>ther report of loth April</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">stated that having received the authority of his superiors he proceeded to Shanklin, saw Yonge, and detailed the particulars of his interview.</hi>) Clarke did not at that or any other time, to my recol<lb/>lection, tell me that he had received information respecting Yonge from a person named Hall—he did not subsequently to the loth April report to me any visits which he had paid to Yonge at the Isle of Wight or any other place—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are warrants for the arrest of Walters, Murray, William Kurr, Montagu, Osborne, and Clark, dated 5th March, 1875—this telegram is in Palmer's handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: From W. Brown, London, to W. Gifford, Queen's Hotel, Bridge of Allan, Scotland. "If <hi rend="italic">Shanks</hi> is near the Isle of Wight let him leave at once and see you. A letter follows." I received this letter and envelope (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from Druscovich on his return from the Bridge of Allan—I believe it was open at that time, and my impression is that this is not the envelope which contained that letter, but this other one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this envelope is not in Palmer's writing—the other is; I also received that from Palmer on his return from the Bridge of Allan—I think Druscovich's letter was in this envelope, and the blotting paper in the envelope marked "D," and they have been mixed since. (<hi rend="italic">Letter read: "</hi> W. Gifford, Queen's Hotel, Bridge of Allan, November 10. There is very strong particulars from Edinburgh, which I suppose you know; they have the address at the Shop here. It is also known that you were in Edinburgh a day or two ago. Perhaps you had better see me—things begin to look fishy-News may be given to Isle of Wight, where Shanklin is. You know best Wired from Edinburgh that plates have been seized. A letter from Shanklin saying that one of the men was well known there. D. goes to Isle of Wight to-morrow. Send this back.—W. Brown, who was with you at the 'Daniel Lambert.'") At that time Palmer was living at 38, Methley Street, Kennington Road—the other envelope which I received from Druscovich contained this piece of blotting paper. (<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: "W.

               <p>letter, dated 16th Nov., 1876, written to me by Druscovich from Edinburgh. (<hi rend="italic">Tins stated that he had one more inquiry to make as to the man about to be engaged by Yonge an a footman. If that failed he had exhausted all Ms inquiries.</hi>) On 15th November I wrote this letter and called upon Meiklejohn to make a report. (<hi rend="italic">Head</hi>: "A statement has been made to the Commissioner that from the 4th to the 6th instant you were at the Queen's Hotel, Bridge of Allan, in company with two men, named Yonge and Gifford, who are wanted for committing extensive frauds. Yonge is said to have lodged with you; you are to report in explanation.") This is the report which Meiklejohn made. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 18th November</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">and stated that on Friday, 3rd instant, he left Derby for Carlisle and Edinburgh, and was in com<lb/>munication with Gollan and Wilson in reference to a stolen portmanteau, and that on Sunday at the Bridge of Allan he met Yonge, who was as much sur<lb/>prised to see him as he (Meiklejohn) was to see him; that he introduced him to kit friend Mr. Thompson, who he saw for the first time; that Yonge asked him to dine with them, and that in the course of conversation Yonge asked him to recommend him to a banker, and, believing him to be a person of position, he mentioned Mr. Monteith's name; that Yonge had given him important informa<lb/>tion with reference to a man named Gray, who was wanted, hut that he now very much regretted having ever seen the man.</hi>) Meiklejohn was taken into cus<lb/>tody on 12th July—I searched his house—I found the draft of a report to the Midland Railway Company, dated 20th November, 1876, in a drawer of a desk at the office—it is in his handwriting. (<hi rend="italic">This was in sub<lb/>stance of a similar character to the one just read.</hi>) I found in the same place this letter, in Meiklejohn's writing; it purports to be a copy of a letter from Meiklejohn to Gollan. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 25th November</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">regretting the annoyance that had been caused to himself Gollan, and Wilson by the meet<lb/>ing with Yonge and Thompson at the Bridge of Allan; that he was innocent of Yonge's antecedents, that he met him in Australia, and afterwards at the Langham Hotel, and found him associating with the first in the land. Had he known of any fraud, the Bridge of Allan and Dumblane would have been the last places at which he should have been seen with him, where he was as well known as he was at Scotland Yard.</hi>) I have heard of the telegram of 4th December purporting to come from me to the police at Rotterdam—I did not send that telegram, or authorise any one to send it—after Druscovich returned from the Bridge of Allan on the 17th November, he made a report to me dated the 18th; I believe it was afterwards amended in Mr. Pollard's presence, not in mine—it was a report to the Commissioner—of course, all reports really <hi rend="italic">go to</hi> the Commissioner, but it was given to me—I have made a mistake in saying it was made on 18th November; it was on 18th December, after his return from Rotterdam—this is it; it is in his writing—there had been previous reports before he went to the Bridge of Allan—this is the first report he made after he came back from the Bridge of Allan. (<hi rend="italic">This detailed the steps he had taken at Edinburgh and the Bridge of Allan; that Mr. Anderson, of the Queen's Hotel, had declined to give any information, alleging that he (Druscovich) was mistaken</hi> in <hi rend="italic">the parties; that he went to other places, and subsequently returned and received from him four letters.</hi>) This telegram, dated 11th November, is from Meiklejohn to Druscovich: "Police Office, Edinburgh. Meet me at ten o'clock; end of Princes Street, Caledonian Station; I can give you information. Must see you without fail; will wait till you come. Im<lb/>portant. Come immediately on receipt of this." At the time Druscovich</p>

               <p>made his report to me I was not aware that ho had received such a tele<lb/>gram as that, he said nothing to mo as to his having received such a telegram—on 25th October, 1876, I was absent from the office until the 28th—on my return I heard of a letter from the chief constable of Leeds, dated 25th October—on 10th January, 1877, I received a letter from him—I believe I did not show that letter to either of the defendants—on 31st December I wrote this letter to Druscovich; the memorandum on the back of it is in Druscovich's writing—I believe it was afterwards found amongst his papers. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Dear Sir,—Henderson, of Leeds, was here yesterday, and told me that about six weeks since he wrote me a letter stating that one of the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Clydesdale notes had been changed at Leeds by Meiklejoln. I cannot recollect ever having seen such a letter. If I had seen it I must recollect it, and should have taken some action upon it. I cannot find that it has ever been received at the office. Did you ever see it? Let me know at once.") (<hi rend="italic">On the back was written</hi>: 2.1.77. Answer. I know nothing of this letter.") That endorsement is Druscovich's writing—I received from him an answer to my letter; it was that he knew nothing about it—these papers (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were found in Druscovich's desk at Scotland Yard; they are in Meiklejohn's writing. (<hi rend="italic">These were two letters, dated respectively 5th and 7th June</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">complaining of the receipt of anonymous letters, and requesting Druscovich to inform him of anything he may have hard.</hi>) I received from Inspector Savers a number of letters and papers which had been found at Drusco<lb/>vich's house—those found in his desk at the office were handed to the Solicitor of the Treasury—on 16th July, 1877, this report from Clarke with reference to the Masonic dinner was received by me or by Colonel Henderson. (<hi rend="italic">Read: "Re</hi> Turf Frauds. I beg to report that during the afternoon of Friday, November 10th, 1876, I was in charge of the office. I remained there till about half-past six; went home to attend a Masonic dinner at Anderton's Hotel, which was fixed for seven but did not take place till eight. I could not have arrived much before that hour. I saw Chief-Inspector Palmer there. I left at ten and returned home. Before leaving the office I was aware that Druscovich was going to Scot<lb/>land. I do not remember mentioning that fact to Palmer.") Among the papers handed to me as found at Druscovich's house, there was this packet of papers, which he has marked as "diary"—In the course of this inquiry a number of reports were made by Clarke, many of which were handed direct to Colonel Henderson—they are all here; this is the last; it is signed by Clarke. (<hi rend="italic">This report was read at length. It commenced by stating that he first became acquainted with the associates of Kurr and Benson in</hi> 1871 <hi rend="italic">in consequence of complaints as to betting agencies carried on by Walters and Murray, whose subsequent convictions were due to his exertions. That he was introduced to Benson, under the name of Yonge, at Shanklin, by a Mr. Andrews, Yonge professing readiness to give him valuable information; also to be the means of restoring a letter which he (Clarke) had written to Walters respecting a burglary. That his first visit to Shanklin was with the sanction of the authorities, and the result was duly reported. That his subsequent interviews convinced him that Yonge was a scoundrel. That the alle<lb/>gations as to his having received money were false, and that the charges made against him by the convicts were from motives of revenge for having been instru<lb/>ment al in putting a stop to their fraudulent proceedings.</hi>) This telegram was found in Druscovich's desk.

Four letters are waiting for the parties at the Queen's Hotel, Bridge of Allan. You should get hold of those letters at once. What are you doing?") I produce a report of Inspector Clarke's dated 7th November, 1875—it has his signature. (<hi rend="italic">This enclosed the letter from William Kurr as printed on page</hi> 623.) These (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are some cheques of the London and Westminster Bank, Temple Bar branch—they were found in Meiklejohn's house at Derby—I produce besides a number of reports of Inspectors Druscovich, Meikle<lb/>john, and Clarke.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. Meiklejohn has been in the force about 13 years, I think—he would enter as a constable, and then, according to length and value of service, he would be promoted up to his present position—I am the head of the detective department, Clarke and Drusco<lb/>vich are of the same rank, Meiklejohn is an inspector only—in the detective department the men under me have sometimes to mix with very dishonest characters for the purpose of obtaining information—it is only from dis<lb/>honest persons, at times, that we can get information about other dishonest persons—there would be no reports from Scotland at Scotland Yard, but if they wanted our assistance, or if there were documents to prove it, they would have them, otherwise we should know nothing about it—I do not remember any reports coming to Scotland Yard from Scotland with regard to any of these frauds—I believe Meiklejohn was on sick leave from June 16th, 1874, to August 28th, but I will verify it by my book—in November, 1873, Meiklejohn reported to me that he had received information that certain cheques of the Bank of England and the Temple Bar branch of the London and Westminster Bank were in the hands of certain people—I have no doubt I told him to get some chouse of each book to show me that the information was true—I think it was about 11th or 12th November, 1876, that I first knew Yonge was Benson—after I had telegraphed to Meiklejohn to arrest Yonge, he came up and made a verbal explanation of his conduct at the Bridge of Allan, and he saw Mr. Abrahams and me, but I do not remember whether he produced a photograph—I believe Benson was spoken of as Benson, and nothing was said of his personal description, beyond that it was understood between us—every one knew who he was—he was described at that time as walking with sticks—I could not be positive whether Meiklejohn informed me of the opening of the account by Benson at the Alloa Bank—I think it was suspected at that time that Kurr was connected with the fraud as Kurr, but there was no evidence—this was about three days previous to Meiklejohn's report, 17th or 18th November last—Kurr was being watched, but we had not gathered in the effect of the watching—Meikle<lb/>john was sick, or on sick leave, from 16th June till 27th August—he left for New York on 19th March, 1875, and returned at half-past ten o'clock on the night of 25th April—on 1st September, 1876, he is put down as</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. Chief Inspector Clarke was taken in custody on the 8th Sept., I think—he had been engaged upon official duty down to that date—he had been engaged for years on a large number of inquiries in reference to certain betting cases for the Treasury authorities, and while the proceedings were actually going on at Marlborough Street Police Court and at Hammersmith Police Court; where persons were charged with keeping betting-houses and prosecuted by the Treasury authorities—I believe one man was fined 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a few days before—on 9th August, 1876, Druscovich was at Dover in charge of case 746—that was the inquiry about Barrett and Co.—on the 10th he left for Hamburg and returned on the 16th—he was absent on leave from 3rd Sept. to the 16th—on the 17th he is put down only as being at the office—he is put down to cases 1056 and 1035 on 26th Oct.—the officer in charge of the office should come on duty at 10 o'clock; the clerks and sergeants would also come at the same hour, if some other duty did not call them else<lb/>where—we consider them at the office and put them down so when they are actually at Bow Street Police Court—I should be always put down as in charge in the office while I was in London—Mr. Abrahams, the solicitor for Madame de Goncourt, first called at Scotland Yard on 25th Sept.—I saw him about half-past 3; and Druscovich about an hour after, or it may have been when I was leaving the office, when I mentioned that he was to take charge of this matter, and instructed him to call upon Mr. Abra<lb/>hams, nest morning—I have no recollection of intimating that <hi rend="italic">if he</hi> went to Mr. Reinhardt's he might find him there—I generally leave from six to half-past—I think I spoke to Druscovich again about it next day or the day after, the 26th or 27th—I don't think I had seen Mr. Abrahams again—I think I heard from Druscovich on the 26th or 27th that arrange<lb/>ments had been made with Mr. Abrahams to go to Marlborough Street and get warrants—I am aware that they went to Mr. Knox—it was reported to me that he declined to grant them in the first instance, and a further application was made a day or two afterwards—some time in November Druscovich communicated to me that ho had made certain inquiries at Somerset House in reference to the forged cheque, to ascer<lb/>tain</p>

               <p>how the stamps had been got upon it—that communication was immediately made to the Edinburgh people—as far as I could judge he appeared to be using his best endeavours to inquire into the case—he complained to me during the progress of his inquiries that Mr. Abrahams had employed private inquiry agents in this matter, and that it rendered his inquiries more difficult, and no doubt it would—he said they interfered with him in his inquiries—I did not see him before he went to Bridge of Allan—I knew nothing of the name of the person supposed to be stopping there, till he came back—while he was in Scotland I received several communi<lb/>cations and telegrams from him—when he returned from Scotland he made a verbal communication to me in reference to Meiklejohn—that must have been shortly after 18th Nov.—he told me that having learned about Meiklejohn being at Dumblane to dinner he had telegraphed to him to come and see him, and that Meiklejohn had replied that he could not come, and that he had sent a further telegram saying that it was most important that he should come, and that he did come, and he saw him in Edinburgh—that and "Archer and Co." were the only two cases in reference to betting matters that I recollect his being entrusted with—then he took Mr. Street into custody, and I believe he was instrumental in putting a stop to "Barrett and Co."—Kurr was under observation at the instance of Druscovich: I cannot tell you the date—two or three officers were watching William Kurr at Marquess Road—they had been placed there by Druscovich's instructions—I think they were there some little time, and then they were taken off and were sent there again in con<lb/>sequence of some information given to me—Sergeant Morgan was sent with Druscovich to Rotterdam on 4th Dec. and five constables of the A Division—I do not know their names—they are still in the Force, as far as I know—Druscovich was the officer in charge—he was responsible for the safe custody of the men—a telegram was sent to Mr. Cardinal, the head of the Rotterdam police, prior to his going—I have no recollection of his suggesting it—I should think he would know that it was sent—he was at Rotterdam on and off about a month altogether, with the exception of two days about Christmas—he told me that if the person who was there in the name of Morton was, as he suspected, the man Benson, he could identify him—that was a most important piece of evidence in refer<lb/>ence to the extradition—it was very important to prove that his proper name was Benson, because they made great difficulties in Holland if we could not give the right name—in the first days of Oct., 1876, a complaint had been made against Sergeant Reimers by Pollaky—that complaint was undergoing investigation from that time for, I should think, two months—Reimers was suspended, but prior to that Colonel Henderson wrote a minute saying he had investigated the matter, and that if Reimers chose to send in his resignation he would accept it—it would not have saved his pension—Druscovich has been in the Force from Dec, 1861, I think—I believe he is English-born, and his present age is thirty-six—his rise was very rapid—I have always found him an anxious, zealous, and energetic officer—he has been rewarded out of the fund appropriated to the purpose by the Chief Magistrate of Bow Street Police Court, the late Sir Thomas Henry, four times, 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each time—I presume that was for conduct deserving praise in reference to matters in which he had been engaged, and a reward of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was ordered him by Mr. Baron Bramwell on 3rd March, 1869, at the Hertford Assizes, for his activity in bringing</p>

               <p>to justice a gang of foreign burglars and also a woman for receiving—there is also strong testimony in his favour from a Grand Jury in Ireland in relation to a matter he was engaged in there on 31st July, 1875, and in addition a letter from the Judge of the Cork Assizes for his intelligence and ability, in conjunction with Detective-Sergeant Greenham, in reference to a loan-office swindle, and the following is an extract from a letter written by the Judge at the Cork Assizes; it does not give his name—"I must say that I never heard evidence given better, clearer, or more satisfactory than that of those three gentlemen who were engaged in this difficult task, and they performed it with an intelligence and an ability that struck me very much." The testimonial of 13th March is that of the foreman of the Grand Jury at the Cork Assizes, Sir Colman M'Louchlin, for bringing to justice some loan-office swindlers—there was a great loan swindle, and a large number of persons were defrauded in Ireland, and he was instrumental in bringing the offenders to justice—there are several other testimonials, the first on the 22nd April, 1867, from Lieut.-Col. Chambers for the manner in which Druscovich performed his duty at Princes Gate on the visit of Garibaldi, and testifying to his great efficiency, and the great services he rendered to the writer by his knowledge of languages—the next is on 29th October, 1868, from Capt. H. B. Hankey, for his vigilance in the apprehension of a man who had committed a burglary, and recover<lb/>ing the property stolen—then at the February Assizes, in 1869, a testi<lb/>monial for bringing to justice, and tracing, and breaking up a gang of foreign burglars—on 8th April, 1870, he was awarded 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Sir Thomas Henry, at Bow Street, for his intelligent and meritorious conduct in the apprehension of Arthur Cissy, who was convicted of fraud and sentenced to five years' penal servitude—he has also received commendation from the Emperor of Russia, and a variety of distinguished persons, and also a diamond scarf pin, a ring, and other articles, and a number of presents—I have got Reimers' Defaulter Sheet—he has been reported eight times. (<hi rend="italic">This sheet gave particulars of the defaults of Reimers from April</hi> 1861 <hi rend="italic">to August</hi> 1876, <hi rend="italic">and included disobedience, incivility, drunkenness, and an assault.</hi>) The last relates to Pollaky—Druscovich has been engaged en important Government business—he speaks French and Italian fluently—there is no official complaint against him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. There has been no official complaint against Palmer—there is no record of his entering the Force in 1854, the record is that he joined on 9th July, 1855—he came to the detective department at the end of 1861—altogether he has been twenty-two years in the Force, sixteen years as a detective—his pay now is 276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he would be entitled to very near two-thirds of his pay as a retiring allowance—that was the condition of things last year—at the time of the rumours of a Fenian plot a number of officers were detailed for service in Scotland, and Palmer was down there attending on the Queen—I have the sheet showing when he has been commended—I only find one in this report—in December, 1875 he was awarded 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. by Col. Henderson for the apprehension of one Robinson who was charged with stealing some cheques and bills value 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I don't at this moment remember his re<lb/>ceiving any commendation or reward from the Treasury—I cannot recol<lb/>lect any instance of his having been commended by the judges—I have attended very few cases in which he has given evidence—he is an officer in whom I had the highest confidence—when a case comes into the office</p>

               <p>it probably gets its distinguishing number in this book the next day, or it may be the same day—914 is the number of the De Groncourt fraud—I believe Palmer had nothing to do with any inquiries with reference to Murray, Walters, Street, Kurr, or Benson—if a case is once placed in the hands of a particular inspector he would be responsible—one inspector does not interfere with another, as a rule; cases are allotted in that way—there was a police-sergeant named Robinson who died some years ago; I heard that his widow had to make a statutory declaration in consequence of the mis-spelling of her husband's name—I cannot recollect whether I saw Palmer in her company on 10th Nov. 1876, about twelve in the day—I believed he mentioned to me that he had been to Bow Street police-court, but whether it was before or after 12 I could not say—I left the office in Scotland Yard about 2 o'clock on 10th November, and was not there afterwards—at the. time I left I believe Palmer was not there—I believe a telegram was sent out in my name to Linton with reference to Druscovich going to Scotland, and another telegram to Brown at Glasgow to send McNab to Edinburgh—they were not my doing—at the time I left Scotland Yard at 2 o'clock there was no absolute arangement made for Druscovich to go to the Isle of Wight, but that was what I wished done—I had told Druscovich to go to Mr. Abrahams and that he had better go to the Isle of Wight, and he had left Scotland Yard before 2, in accordance with my suggestion—as far as I know up to 2 o'clock at Scotland Yard, the belief was that he was going to the Isle of Wight—I have no record of the time when the telegram was sent off to Linton, at Edinburgh—it would be in the evening time certainly—I know that Palmer and Clarke were members of the Domatic Lodge of Freemasons, and that they met at Anderton's Hotel—I had frequently given Palmer leave to quit the office early in the afternoon for the purpose of attending the lodge—I should think it would take about forty minutes to walk from his house to Fleet Street—I don't think he had any duty to do with respect to any of the turf frauds—on 18th Nov. Druscovich returned to London and came to the office—my impression is that the two letters he handed to me were opened, but I would not positively swear—the two envelopes with the two letters were given to me, and I went at once to Mr. Abrahams' office with Druscovich—I have no recollection of what was said when the letters were handed to me, except that they were the two letters that he had received at the Bridge of Allan—I went to Mr. Abrahams' office, and took the papers out of the envelopes—I did not then say "They are both in Palmer's handwriting;" what occurred was this, Druscovich was sitting at one part of the table and I at the other, examining the letters, I took them out and gave them to Druscovich and said, "These are' Palmer's handwriting," those were the exact words—I may have said "both"—I had both letters in my hand—when the two letters were brought to Bow Street the pencil letter was in the envelope now spoken of as Kurr's writing, and the blotting-paper letter, "keep the lame man out of the way," was in the other envelope—the letters had not been in my possession all the time between 18th November and 19th July; they had been given into the hands of the Treasury solicitors some time in November I think—I say that there is an attempt to disguise the hand<lb/>writing on the envelope not written by Kurr—I don't remember having been present when the blotting-paper letter was shown to Kurr,</p>

               <p>except at the police-court—he said it was not Palmer's writing—on the first occasion I did not look at the letters very carefully—on the next day or the day after, Palmer came into my office, and said "I understand that some letters have been found in Scotland which are said to be in my handwriting; will you let me see them?"—I said "I cannot; you shall see them when the proper time arrives"—he left the room—I don't remember his saying it was very unfair towards him—he was never shown the letters by me—I have never called on Palmer for a report on this matter, and I believe there is none—he was arrested on 12th July—I first saw the telegram from Brown to Gifford some time in November; it was not in my possession—I said at Bow Street that I had in my mind's eye a similarity to Palmer's handwriting with the writing of that telegram, and that I could depict it if I was allowed a pencil, and I did put some<lb/>thing down which I thought was so on a sheet of deposition paper, and Sir James Ingham promised it should be sent forward to this court—I was examined three or four times at Bow Street, I think it was on 11th, 13th, or 15th that I was cross-examined about this telegram—I think I said that the words "Edinboro'," "Brown," "Isle of Wight," "wired," and "fraud" in the pencil letter struck me; the general appearance of the thing struck me, besides the words; I referred to the capital letters ¥, 0, E, and W, those were in both the telegram and the letter; those were the letters that struck me—until I heard that that envelope was written by Kurr I did not believe that Palmer's son had written it—I sent for some of Palmer's son's handwriting; that was for the purpose of comparing it with the writing on the envelope, for no other reason—it is not quite accurate that I expressed an opinion that the writing on the envelope was Palmer's son's; my recollection of what I said is that it was very like Palmer's son's handwriting; I did not give such a positive opinion as that—my opinion is the same now as it was then—my deposition was read over to me; I did not say it was not correct, I may not have noticed it; I said it was something like Palmer's son's—since I was examined at Bow Street I have rubbed up my memory about Sergeant Dillon—I did not give an opinion that certain letters were written by Dillon; I expressed an opinion that they were not, and that opinion was supported by M. Chabot after<lb/>wards—there is no record of any opinion having been expressed by me with regard to Inspector Bradley, of Plymouth—that inquiry has not been reopened, I believe; Bradley was suspected of sending anonymous letters to the Superintendent or the Commissioner, and he was called on to resign, or dismissed—I will not swear that I did not express an opinion that those letters were in Bradley's writing, because I have no recollection of the papers being brought under my notice—I was snown the letter written by Inspector Clarke to Walters, and the forged copy of it—I said if I had not known that one must be a forgery I should not have been able to say which was the original—I do not know Street at all.</p>

I have known Chief Inspector Clarke personally in the service of the police over twenty years; he joined the police in April, 1840—he was the senior officer at Scotland Yard, taking charge of the office when I was absent and when he was disengaged; he was my most confidential and trusted assistant—he has been engaged for some eight or nine years in suppressing betting-houses and turf swindles</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220229"/>
               <p>and has practically had the chief share in such prosecutions as have been carried on for some years past for offences of that character—as far as I could judge he has always conducted those cases with great industry, energy, and skill, and the result has been the conviction since 1869 of a <hi rend="italic">very large</hi> number of persons for offences of that kind—looking at his position and experience, he would have considerable discretion allowed him with respect to those matters—he duly obtained authority to go to Shanklin, and he reported the visit he made in pursuance of that authority—with regard to information that he got or attempted to get from persons he thought might help him, it would not be his duty to report that in detail, unless it led to some result.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I think there was nothing suspicious in his not reporting such inquiries as he made of Benson, when he did not succeed in getting any accurate or useful information—having once with the sanc<lb/>tion and knowledge of his superiors been put in communication with a person from whom he proposed to get information, whether he continued that communication, and how fax he carried it, would be a matter that to a great extent would lie in his discretion; if he obtained substantial results, that should be reported to his superiors for further action to be taken—as chief inspector his income was about 276<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he has brought up a family of five or six children—as far as I ever saw, he has always lived in a frugal, economical, and quiet way—in the prosecution of inquiries with regard to betting matters he would necessarily become known to a large number of persons engaged in these swindles—we have a private door at Scotland Yard by which the officers sometimes leave to avoid observation—I can't say whether the officers would be watched by those persons—Clarke told me, either at the latter part of last year or the beginning of this, that some mysterious inquiries had been made about him in his neighbour<lb/>hood—he has been engaged in some very confidential matters, which would not find their way into the police books—an officer must necessarily be allowed a discretion in a case with which he is entrusted—it is the custom at Scotland Yard to have the attendance and occupation of all the officers recorded each day; a list of names is kept with the numbers of the cases in which they are engaged each day—there is a morning report made to the Commis<lb/>sioner, showing how the officers have been engaged on the previous day—the officers generally come in about six in the evening—that is the ordinary practice, and then the report is made up with regard to what has taken place during the day—I was aware of the inquiry with respect to the burglary at Stannard's Mill—it was with my sanction that Clarke put himself in communication with Walters in order to get information—as far as I know the statements in Clarke's long report of 6th of September are correct—after his report of his first visit to Shanklin I had a conver<lb/>sation with him about it, when he expressed his distrust of Benson—all officers are allowed sums for their expenses, and they give account of all expenses for locomotion and things of that kind—there are certain small sums they are allowed for getting information, as to which they would only give a verbal explanation—during the early part of 1875, as far as I could judge, Clarke continued the prosecution of the Walters and Murray fraud, steadily and with satisfactory energy—he investigated the bail that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220230"/>
               <p>was offered for them, and made full reports of his proceedings with regard to the character of the bail, and exerted himself to prevent the release of those persons—on 22nd June, 1875, he was on leave for one day; that appears from this book—(<hi rend="italic">referring</hi>) he was on leave from 3rd August until the 16th August inclusive—on Sunday, 4th July, 1875, he was engaged in London upon cases numbered 134 and 625—134 was an inquiry respecting the assault on Mr. Porch by Walters, Murray, and others, and 625 to Mercy Ann Corfield, who was in fact Mina Jury, who was a witness in the Tichborne case—he is put down here as being engaged in London on this case—on 3rd July he was at Sandown Park Races—on 2nd July he was at Sandown Park Races—on 1st July he was engaged about a larceny at Lord Derby's in St. James's Square—on the 30th June he was engaged on the same matter—on 29th June on the same matter—on Monday, the 28th, on the same matter—during that week he was engaged either in respect of the larceny at Lord Derby's or at Sandown Races—I remember the communication from Mr. Cresswell about Parbrook—I believe Clarke made inquiries about that—the official papers are in court—the date of that matter is May, 1876—the papers in the Walters and Murray fraud passed through his hands—he was in constant communication with the Solicitor to the Treasury with respect to those matters—on 25th September he was engaged about the Von Howard case—I cannot tell you that on that day he was in consultation with <hi rend="italic">two</hi> gentlemen who had come over from Germany; I know that he did see them, in consultation with Mr. Pollard or some gentleman from the Treasury—I cannot fix the day, this book only gives me how he was employed generally—he continued his duties during the time the evidence was going on at Bow Street—he made reports from time to time. (<hi rend="italic">A report of 3rd August</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">was read, which called attention to Kurr's state<lb/>ment that on 25th September</hi>, 1876, <hi rend="italic">he had received from him apiece of blotting-paper in an envelope, and that he saw him at his house; this he described as a cruel and malicious falsehood on the part of a man who would stop at nothing short of murder.</hi>) I have heard from Mr. Pollard's evidence what that phrase" nothing short of murder" refers to.

There is a bill bearing date October 6th, showing that inquiries had been made prior to that, with reference to the cab at the Midland Station—I was not in town until the end of that mouth—I produce the police information of October 10th—there is an item at 1.30 p.m., "C.O. Detective Memorandum—8 in the afternoon of the 30th ult, cor<lb/>rected description, Jacob Francis, Lewis Montagu <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Coster, growing whiskers, very thin, cut on the side of the left eye, arrived at St. Pancras 8 a.m. on 4th, took a cab, discharged it on Pentonville</p>

               <p>Hill, took another passing, carried a small bag; special inquiry to be made to find second cab." "Special inquiry" would mean that each division would make inquiries at cab yards and ranks—the reports made by Clarke with reference to the inquiries as to the attempts against the Prince of Wales and Lord Beaconsfield, are in the possession of Colonel Henderson—they would be confidential matters and would be handed to Colonel Henderson—(<hi rend="italic">Clarke's report of 1st July</hi>, 1875, <hi rend="italic">was again read</hi>)—in consequence of that report police informations were sent out to all the divisions—it was two months later when the letter was received from Kurr saying that his name had been mixed up in the turf frauds; and the receipt of that letter was at once reported to the office by Inspector Clarke—when a letter will answer the same purpose as a telegram it would be the duty of the officer in charge to send a letter, and not go to the expense of a telegram—in the case of a communication with Glasgow, if information had to be sent from Scotland Yard after bank hours with a view of stopping notes on the following day. a letter would answer the same purpose as a telegram, and it would be the duty of the officer to send a letter and not a telegram—the documents connected with the case would be in my room, and when required for production they would be in charge of the officer whose duty it would be to look after the evidence—I believe there was a special basket for the reception of letters and documents connected with the De Goncourt case—the basket and documents would be under the control of the officer in charge of the case—in the contingent expenses' of 10th November I find charged by Inspector Clarke: Charing Cross to Woolwich and back, railway fare, return ticket, 22 miles, 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—there is also a special bill of expenses charged by him upon that day—"Charing Cross to Addison Road, return ticket 7. 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—it appears that that was for making inquiries respecting Henri De Tourville—on the afternoon of the 10th of November I left the office at two o'clock—I could not say from the charges made by Clarke for expenses to Woolwich and Addison Road on that day that the journeys were made after I left the office—I find a special bill on Nov. 14th for Clairke's expenses going to Uxbridge on the De Tourville business—at that time Inspector Clarke was a great deal engaged on that matter—I remember the case of O'Regan in which Clarke was engaged—that case came before the magistrate before Clarke was arrested, in August or September I think—as I have not the papers I cannot speak positively to the date—many of the people engaged in matters into which Clarke has had to inquire have made large sums of money—apart from this case I have never had the smallest reason to suspect In<lb/>spector Clarke of default of duty, or of any want of integrity in the con<lb/>duct of matters entrusted in him—I cannot say if Inspector Clarke's house can be seen from the King's Arms—there are three turnings out of Great College Street into Westminster—Little College Street, Burdon Street, and Tufton Street.</p>

               <p>recollection that it was discovered that two cabs had been taken from the station, one by the master and the other by the servant—I have a book here in which the leave of officers is recorded; it does not record the reason of the leave—on 11th September there is a record that Meiklejohn was on duty at the Midland Railway—it would be known that he was to take his duty on the 11th September, and it would be put down from that, from the knowledge of the clerk—it is usual for an officer to come to the office the first thing in the morning to report himself—it is not an invari<lb/>able rule; sometimes an officer may go about some case that he has charge of, and not come to the office for some time; that frequently happens—I was on duty when Druscovich came back from the Bridge of Allan—I have noticed that he has been somewhat excitable for the last twelve months, previous to last October—he had charge of this case—Mr. Abra<lb/>hams saw me very frequently on the case—Druscovich, I think, he saw mostly at his office; he was constantly sent for there—Mr. Abrahams was making suggestions as to what should be done—Druscovich caused Wil<lb/>liam Kurr's house, 29, Marquess Road, to be watched—I knew nothing of Kurr—I must have heard his name in connection with the Walters and Murray fraud, but that was all I knew of him—I did not know at that time that he had lived there for a considerable time; I learnt it after<lb/>wards—it must have been some time about the middle or end of Novem<lb/>ber that Kurr was first suspected of having anything to do with the fraud on Madame de Goncourt—it was not Mr. Abrahams, to my recollection, who mentioned it to me; the suggestion may have come from him—this diary is Druscovich's writing, and the entry of 27th October is his—I think I heard when I came home that Druscovich had been down to Newmarket to see some one—I have no recollection of hearing from him that he had received this information about "William Kurr from Mr. Abra<lb/>hams—it was not until November that persons were put to watch his house—Druscovich complained that Mr. Abrahams had employed some private inquiry officers, which embarrassed him; I don't know at what time he did it; I think it was not till after he came back from the Bridge of Allan—he did not tell me that he had received a telegram purporting to come from Meiklejohn, until after he had told Mr. Pollard at the Trea<lb/>sury—I cannot fix the date when he told me—I think he returned from the Bridge of Allan on 18th November, and on 18th December he made the report which has been read—he then made some communication to Mr. Pollard—it must have been soon after he came from Rotterdam that he spoke to me about if, in January this year, I met him in the passage at the Treasury, and he said "I have foolishly kept back a telegram, but now I have told Mr. Pollard all about it"—that was the substance of the conversation; I don't think he told me anything more about it—what he told me was, to my recollection, that he had kept it back with a view of shielding Meiklejohn from blame in some shape; to the best of my recol<lb/>lection, that was all he told me on the subject—I spoke with Mr. Abra<lb/>hams about William Kurr; I could not say that I did or did not speak to Clarke about it; at this distance of time I could not say—I knew that Kurr was a man for whose arrest Clarke at one time had a warrant—if Druscovich had learnt early in the afternoon that some of the Clydesdale notes had come in, and if that information would have reached Glasgow in time for inquiries to be made at the bank, it certainly would have been his duty to have telegraphed at once—if the information had reached him</p>

               <p>as early as 1.30 there would have been plenty of time; I should have done so—it would be a very unusual thing to go to a bank manager after banking hours; we always go to banks in banking hours—the great thing to ascertain would be by whom the notes had been paid into the bank at Glasgow; that we should ascertain from the clerks of the bank—we should not go to the manager after the bank was closed, without it was under very extraordinary circumstances—I think the circumstances ought to be very extraordinary to induce an officer to telegraph after banking hours—I have known Palmer about twenty years; I have been constantly in the habit of seeing his handwriting for the last sixteen—I say that the telegram of 10th October from the West Strand office in the name of Brown is in Palmer's writing, also the pencil letter brought by Druscovich from the Bridge of Allan—the direction on the envelope containing the blotting-paper, which has on it "keep the lame man out of the way," is also in Palmer's writing—this little almanac (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing a number of memoranda, is also Palmer's writing, and also this official diary—on 10th November, the day Palmer left for the Bridge of Allan, I left the office somewhere about two and did not come back—I believe Clarke was at the office when I left—I cannot say whether that was after or before he had been to Woolwich—I know nothing about his going to Addison Road, beyond the official papers—he made a report about the Masonic dinner on 16th July, 1877—Clarke would be in charge of the office in my absence; that would be after two o'clock till the time for closing it—early on 10th November it was the intention that Druscovich should go to the Isle of Wight; that was what I told him he should suggest to Mr. Abrahams—I had received some information about Yonge in a letter from Mr. Rayner, the postmaster at Shanklin, on 10th November—I think that was the first time I had heard the name of Yonge in connection with this matter—I don't know that I mentioned what I had heard specially to Clarke—my room is separate from his—the only conversation I had in the matter was with Druscovich, to my recollection, he had been in charge of the case—I don't know that it occurred to me at that time that Yonge was the man that Clarke had been to see in 1875—two years had elapsed, and it had passed out of my memory—if Clarke charged his expenses to the Treasury when he went to see Yonge, there would be a record of it—I have not the bill, but I have no doubt there is a record of the expenses of his first journey there on 12th April, 1875—I should say there is no record of any of his subsequent journeys there—Clarke had leave for one day, on 22nd January, 1875—there is no record why that leave was given—the 16th August would be his annual leave; his holiday—he was away from the 3rd to the 16th inclusive he came back to his work on the 17th—he had no leave between 22nd June and 3rd August—the letter of 4th April, 1874, which Clarke wrote to Walters, he got back—he did not tell me about that till after this case had com<lb/>menced—he then told me it had been left at his house one night by a man—I don't think he had told me before that how he had got it back—I have no recollection of seeing the letter until I saw it in the hands of Mr. Pollard. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is it at all customary for officers when they write letters to give no address and no name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would depend entirely upon the circum<lb/>stances under which it was written—if he were writing a letter, and his correspondent knew who it came from, probably he would not put his flame—there must obviously be some occasions upon which a detective</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the assistants to the Treasury Solicitor, Mr. Stephenson—I have had the investigation of this case in my charge for a considerable time—I remember something being said by Benson at Bow Street about a parcel of letters that was supposed to have been sent to Hawkins—after that evidence had been given we made an application to the Post-office, and subsequently a gentleman from the Post-office brought a parcel; it was opened in my presence, and con<lb/>tained among other things four or five letters written by Inspector Clarke to Benson—I remember Druscovich's report of 18th Dec. to the Commis<lb/>sioner—subsequently to that Druscovich came to me, I think it was in consequence of an application from me—I took down what he said as to the telegrams purporting to come from Meiklejohn—it was mentioned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220235"/>
               <p>in this way, I was in Scotland making inquiries in December, 1876; I learnt from Supt. Linton that he had given to Druscovich a telegram which he had received on the morning of Druscovich's arrival at the police-office in Edinburgh, and, as no mention was made of it in this report, I told Druscovich that I had discovered this, and asked him if he had received such a telegram from Meiklejohn—he said Supt. Linton did give him a telegram from Meiklejohn—I asked him what he did, whether he saw Meiklejohn—he said that he went to the top of Prince's Street in one of the tramcars, it being a wet morning, while the cabman McNab was having his breakfast, and when he got to the end of Princes Street he did not see Meiklejohn, that he waited some ten minutes or so, and no one appearing, he returned to the other end of Princes Street, and then went to the police-office and saw McNab, and went about the inquiry at Brydone's, but he had seen no one at the other end of Princes Street, neither Meiklejohn or any one that came from him, and he thought it was a hoax—he said when he got to the Bridge of Allan he telegraphed to Meiklejohn to come and see him, and again when he got to Edinburgh; he said that several telegrams had passed from him to Meiklejohn, and one or two in reply from Meiklejohn stating that he could not come to Edinburgh to see him; that eventually he did come to Edinburgh, and he saw him there, in the presence of Mr. Linton, at the White Hart Hotel, a day or two afterwards—this was stated to me on 17th January this year.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WILLIAMS</hi>. I was examined as a witness before the magistrate—I remember being asked to state what Kurr said to me as to where he was going at the time he was arrested, and my answer was "He said he was going to meet Sawyer"—he also said that Mr. Sawyer and Mr. Froggatt wanted him to let them have the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of Clydesdale bank-notes, that they might pay them into a bank in their own names and hold them for him; that he said he would take time to consider with his friends, and, having considered, he felt sure they meant to stick to the money, and that under those circumstances, and fearing that he had let Mr. Sawyer, of whom he knew nothing, know too much, he had made an appointment to meet Sawyer on the Sunday night for the purpose of handing him the notes; that Kurr said the appointment was to take place in an empty house in the Essex Road, and that he had made up a parcel of old newspapers and a cash-box, and that he was leaving his house with his companions, and then he added "Thank God I was arrested;" that I was struck with his manner when he said those last words, and looked up at him and said "What! the revolver!" and that he nodded his head in affirmation—I may mention that this all took place in the presence of the Governor of Newgate—that is as nearly as possible word for word what passed between me and Kurr—he did not say one word about meeting Clarke on that night—I had charge of this case in the earlier stages—I have been assisting in the conduct of the case from the beginning—I have seen Kurr several times, and I saw Frederick Kurr, and Mr. Abrahams has seen Benson—Mr. Abrahams has undoubtedly had a great share in the conduct of the case—Benson stated at the police-court that Mr. Abrahams went to see him on two or three occasions; that was at the request of the Solicitor of the Treasury—I could not tell without referring to the notes that Kurr was cross-examined by you on Saturday, 3rd Aug., or when Clarke was</p>

               <p>given into custody—Clarke was first called as a witness to prove the arrest of Mr. Froggatt; he was never cross-examined; I heard you apply for leave to cross-examine him after Kurr had given his evidence, as his cross-examination implicated him—Kurr suggested that Benson had told him he had bribed a father and son at the Treasury—my son is associated with me at the Treasury—I do not know of any other father and son at the Treasury now—that statement is quite untrue as far as I know.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. STRAIGHT</hi>. I do not think that Mr. Williamson came in during my conversation with Druscovich—if he did we did not go on with it while he was there; I think he came in afterwards—I think Mr. Williamson met him in the passage as he was going away—when I asked him his reason for not mentioning, this, he said "I did not wish to injure a brother officer, I did not think perhaps that he had been guilty of anything wrong, and I did not wish to injure him"—he said there were several other telegrams at that time, that he (Druscovich) had telegraphed to Meiklejohn, asking him to meet him, but we had not any of those telegrams.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. I did not take the original statement of William Kurr—he sent one first to the Treasury at the end of May or the beginning of June, I think—I subsequently saw him on several occasions. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did his story grow from time to time? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think it was only an enlargement of the story that he had first sent; I went more into details; he had given generalities, and I asked him for particulars—I don't think I showed him the blotting-paper writing and the pencil letter—I feel pretty confident that the first time he saw them was at the police-court—I never took anything to show him.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">THE COURT</hi>. I did not treat him as an ordinary witness, I got what I could from him to see what corroboration there was of it—I had no conversation with him with regard to the letters that were brought from Edinburgh—I only asked him for an explanation of his own story; I gave him no indication whatever as to any information we had from any source.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BESLEY</hi>. He was first shown the blotting-paper letter at the police-court, I will not be sure that I was there at that moment—I have known Palmer 20 years at least, ever since I have been at the Treasury, I do not know how much longer he has been in the police—he has given evidence in a great number of cases, so that I have had opportunities of seeing the way in which he conducted his duties; in all the cases we have had his conduct has been to the entire satisfaction of the Treasury solicitor; I believe he always gave his evidence fairly—I went to see Benson once in Pentonville.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CLARKE</hi>. I remember the Walters and Murray case when they were under charge for an assault—it was Clark who laid the information against them on the more serious charge, and he procured the warrants—during the whole of that case there is no doubt that he showed the greatest energy and determination in following up every clue that could be obtained—I remember Kurr's letter offering to surrender, but only by seeing my mark on it. I should not have remembered it other<lb/>wise; it was no doubt submitted to me at the time; I have also no doubt that I spoke to Mr. Stephenson about it, and also to Mr. Poland, and whatever directions were given to Clarke were given in consequence of my communication with Mr. Poland—I remember the Von Howard case very well, Clarke had the conduct of that case after his mentioning in his</p>

               <p>report about meeting with Professor Balzuy and Mr. Schmidt, two witnesses from Germany in that case, I looked in my diary and found that those two witnesses were brought to me on the day he mentioned, the 25th September; that would be in the morning, before one o'clock, I should think; he left with them, I forget where he went—he gave every atten<lb/>tion to that case, he did all that he was asked—I was several days taking Kurr's statement, I went on four several days to Newgate, always in the presence of the Governor—Mr. Clarke's name was not mentioned until the fourth day—after he had mentioned other names I asked him directly whether he knew any other officer at Scotland Yard who had been bribed by him or his confederates—he said there were none others—afterwards I asked him specifically about Inspector Clarke, by direction of Mr. stephenson; it had been talked about before my visit on that occasion, because Clarke's name had never been mentioned, and I was particularly desired to ask him, if he left his name out again, and he said no, that he believed Clarke to be an honest man—Kurr made a statement to me orally about giving addressed envelopes to somebody other than Inspector Clarke; he has mentioned the name here, the man named Harry Street—I have been assisting the Treasury solicitor for twenty years—I think Inspector Clarke has had more to do with our cases, being Government cases, than any of the other inspectors—I have never had the slightest reason to suspect him—the pencil letter and the blotting-paper letter have been submitted to examination by more than one person, by Mr. Chabot, and a gentleman from the Bank of England, I forget his name; no others—specimens of handwriting, Inspector Clarke's amongst others, have been handed to those gentlemen for the purpose of comparison.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">ATTORNEY-GENERAL</hi>. When Kurr made the state<lb/>ment about Sawyer and Mr. Froggatt wanting him to let them have the 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was in a room in the gaol, I think the deputy governor's room—he did not make such a statement at the Treasury—he said that he and his companions were going to keep the appointment at the empty house when he was arrested, not that he was going there afterwards—it was so very peculiar the way in which he said it, "I was going to keep the appointment, and, thank God, I was arrested"—I did not take that down—that was not at the first interview I had with him, it was just before the statement about Clarke; he had come to the end of his story, and then he volunteered this—it was after that that he told me he had not bribed Clarke—up to that time he had not said anything about Clarke, he had finished his statement, and then I put the question to him about Clarke, by direction; I put it to him both ways, whether he himself had bribed Clarke, or knew that he had been bribed, and he said he never knew of his being bribed, or that he had bribed him himself, that he believed him to be an honest man—that was on the fourth interview, at the same inter<lb/>view that he told me about the newspapers, and going to meet Sawyer and Mr. Froggatt—after this question had been put to him I had a great many statements from him with respect to Clarke—he did not say that he intended to make up a parcel of newspapers, what he said led me to understand that he was going with a representation of a cash box with bank-notes, that was what I understood him to say—I have acted in this matter from time to time under instructions from the law officers of the. Crown—it was originally placed in the hands of the solicitor's department of the Treasury by the Home Office—I have been most careful through</p>

               <p>out not to convey to the convicts any circumstance of corroboration that I might have discovered, and careful to test in every way their statements and to give them no opportunity, if I could help it, of inventing anything—I gave them no indication of any information we had obtained else<lb/>where in the shape of corroboration. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say Kurr told you what you have stated with respect to Clarke—did he afterwards make a state<lb/>ment to you as to why he did not mention Clarke's name before? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never to me personally; he has mentioned it in those reports or written statements which he sent in from time to time—I think it was in August that he first mentioned Clarke's name, I mean in a written statement; I think it was in August, of course I speak under correction, not having the papers before me, but I think I have looked with reference to that, and the end of July or the beginning of August was the earliest—with regard to the Walters and Murray fraud Clarke did everything he could, as far as it was possible to judge—I only knew of his first visit to Shanklin—I knew of the report, and that was all I knew about it—I knew nothing about his interview with Mr. Hall; I heard nothing about Mr. Hall; I heard that one or two persons had come to give him information; I heard him say a man named Krampowiski and another man named Nicholls came; those are names that after<lb/>wards cropped up in this case, but I did not know anything of them; they did not crop up in the Walters and Murray case; I never heard of Krampowiski except by Clarke's complaining about his coming to give information—in that case I took his reports to Mr. Poland, and we took our instructions entirely from Mr. Poland, or any other counsel having charge of the case; we took everything to them, and took their opinion upon it—Mr. Poland felt that there was no evidence against Kurr, no one had ever seen this man in custody, and everybody had gone to their respec<lb/>tive homes on the Continent, and we thought it was very difficult to get evidence.</p>

I am a detective sergeant of Scotland Yard—when engaged in the investigation of the De Goncourt fraud I was with Meikle<lb/>john at Newmarket on 24th Oct., and he had a person in his company named M'Nab—I met with both at the railway station, and they accom<lb/>panied me to my lodging—I was sent down for the purpose of watching the proceedings at the racing—Mr. Druscovich was in my company the whole day, he had his meals with me, and "I saw him to the carriage at night, and wished him good night—I have known Kurr for some years—I am sure he did not speak to Druscovich on that day, because Druscovich never left me for two minutes—we saw him together and pointed him out to M'Nab, the cabman—M'Nab did not recognise him—Druscovich said that if he saw any one there whom he had seen in Scotland, if he could not find him, Druscovich, he was to find me at once, so that I might arrest him, if we should be separated for a minute or two; but that did not occur—Kurr was in Tattersall's ring, where he always went when he was at a race-course—I do not remember in whose company he was—I did not speak to Mr. Ashley—Mr. Druscovich was with him—I believe he is editor of the <hi rend="italic">Spartsman</hi>—I was one of the officers sent over to Rotterdam in January; four constables went with me, Wright, Rose,. Carpenter, and Morris—we came hack by the steamer on the 13th—we left Rotterdam on Friday and arrived here on the Saturday morning—we went over the previous Tuesday—we were there two clear days—the night before we came over Druscovich gave special directions as to the precautions we were to take with the prisoners—I was sent to where the constables were lodging for the purpose—we were to be very careful and not to trust to any one but ourselves. and he explained the dangerous character of the men, more especially Benson and young kurr; Benson he said might commit suicide, or he was capable of doing anything—on board the steamer it fell to my lot to be with Frederick kurr and Bale in consequence of two of our men being very ill; Mr. Druscovich was also obliged to take a part with me—I was principally with Bale—I believe Druscovich was not with him at all—he was a very short time with Benson, while Rose went to get something to eat—I stopped at the door—the prisoners were in separate cabins—when we arrived at Harwich Benson spoke to Druscovich, and said he hoped he was not going to put the handcuffs on him; Druscovich said he should certainly do so, why should he make an exception of him?—Benson remarked that he was not a very dangerous man—Druscovich said he would not trust him, and he handcuffed them all—on the way to London in the train I sat alongside of Benson, with our backs to the engine—Druscovich was opposite—Benson and I engaged in a conversation—he made a remark to Druscovich in French, and Druscovich said, "Speak English, why should you speak French?" and then he spoke to me again—I only understand a word or two of French—there was no conversation, not ten words successively, between Benson and Druscovich during the whole journey, or at all in</p>

                  </hi>. I have been clerk to Mr. Froggatt about five years—I sat in his private office—I remember the convict Murray calling upon Mr. Froggatt in November last—he gave the name of Wells, Dante Road, Newington—he wished Mr. Froggatt to proceed to Scotland to endeavour to recover 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which the bank there had detained or refused to hand over—something was also said about instructions to recover some of the money in the City; from Messrs. Venables, in Cornhill, I think, who had refused to hand over to him two 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes—he told Mr. Froggatt that they were sent to him by a Mr. Sampson, I think in some betting trans<lb/>action—he had backed a horse called Kosebery for the Cambridgeshire for 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he received these notes in payment—he insrructed Mr. Froggatt to call upon Messrs. Wright and Venables, and he would call again in a day or two for the answer—on the 21st, 22nd, or 23rd November he came again and gave Mr. Froggatt a Clydesdale note for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was paid into the bank the next day—he said he had no smaller change—he said "You will want that for costs, for you may have to go farther than Scotland, in the event of two actions being brought"—no change was given for the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was on account of costs—it was paid to him in my presence—Murray said he had received the two cheques, one for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., that the bank refused to pay, from Mr. Carsons of Liverpool—I think he is a merchant there—I believe I only saw Murray in Mr. Froggatt's presence on these two occasions—he said in expla<lb/>nation of the refusal of the bank to pay the money, that one of the drawers was an absconding bankrupt, that was why it was necessary Froggatt</p>

I will go away, and won't give evidence against them"—Mr. Froggatt said he would have nothing to do with him, he said "You had better go and speak to Mr. Abrahams," who was coming out of Court at</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant-solicitor to the Treasury and live at 10, Granville Park, Lewisham—on 28th May last I had been, visiting some friends at Woolwich—at 9.30 in the evening I started to return home in a hired fly, accompanied by two ladies—I don't know the driver's name—we drove along the Dartford Road until we came on to Blackheath—when we got near the Ranger's house we turned to the left across the top of the heath—there is a long, empty gravel pit along the side of the road there for about 150 yards, and when the carriage was about the middle of the gravel pit, on the road side, it suddenly stopped—I was on the point of looking out to see what the cause of the stoppage was when my attention was drawn to the off-side window, which was closed, and I there saw a man standing at the window—it was then about ten minutes to ten; the moon had not risen—the man had a mask on the upper part of his face and a pistol in his hand, which he pointed into the carriage, and I heard him say "Your money, or I'll fire"—he repeated this once or twice, perhaps three times—I thought it was some drunken man, and I said "Go away," and I called out at the same time to the driver "Drive on"—he made no reply, the carriage did not move, so I again said "Drive on "more loudly—he said "I can't"—at that moment, to my surprise, at the window where I was sitting, which was partially open, another man appeared—he had a piece of crape across the lower. part of his face, and a pistol in his hand, which he pointed into the carriage, and said "Your money, or I'll fire instantly"—he repeated this two or three times as I hesitated to do anything—I then put my hand in my pocket and took out some loose silver, I believe 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which I handed to him—he took it in his left hand, still holding the pistol into the carriage towards me—he then said "This won't do for me, you have got more than that, you have got a purse; I'll have your purse, be quick"—I attempted to get my head out of the way of the pistol, which he continued</p>

               <p>to point at me, and in doing so I leant back into the corner of the carriage—he then pulled the door open with his left hand and presented the pistol at my head and said "Your purse instantly, or I'll fire"—this he repeated, and said "Ill blow your brains out if you don't give it me immediately"—under the circumstances I then took my purse out of my pocket and handed it to the man—he took it in his left hand, as he had done the silver, and I saw him weigh it apparently for a moment in his hand—he then said "There are more of you," looking towards the ladies—I said "You have got all I have"—he then shut the door to and said "Go on"—at the time he pulled the door open I saw the other man standing about a yard behind him on the side of the road, which is about a foot higher than the roadway—he held in his hand a pistol, about a yard from me—in a very short time the carriage was driven on—I did not see the driver or hear him—I could not see what became of the men—I was driven to my house; I got the ladies out and immediately drove on to the police station and gave information—one of the men, the first I saw, had on a light overcoat, I can't say anything more than that—the other had a dark coat, and both had low-crowned hats—I did not notice the pistols suffi<lb/>ciently to say whether they were revolvers or not, but I distinctly saw the gleam of the barrel of the one that was pointed at me in the carriage, and I should gather from that that it only had one barrel—I have seen the revolver produced—it might have been one of those I saw—my purse contained two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes and seven sovereigns, two blank cheques and some postage stamps—I had drawn a cheque for 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at my bankers, Messrs. Fuller, of Lombard Street, that morning, and I went the next moraine and got the numbers of the notes (<hi rend="italic">notes produced</hi>)—I don't know that I can identify them—these are the numbers the bankers gave me—I went direct to the Bank of England and stopped the notes—I saw the faces of the men, but they were disguised, I could not <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> their features at all—I should say both were slim men—I think the height of one would be about the height of the tallest of the prisoners (Dinham)—it so struck me, but I could not form a very good judgment of their height, because I was sitting in the carriage and just saw them over the window.</p>

Monday, the 21st May—we went to London and stayed two nights at an eating-house in a street leading down to the Houses of Parliament; "that two days after they arrived Hyslope was married to a young woman from Portsmouth—I don't know that he said she went with them from Ports<lb/>mouth—they then took lodgings in King William Street, Greenwich—he said they were away from Portsmouth about four weeks—I then said the day or the day following they arrived in Portsmouth a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Bank of England note, which had been stolen with other money from the person of Mr. Hodgson, on Blackheath, on 28th May, had been passed at the shop where he was employed—he said "I know nothing about it"—I did not detain him at that time, but I communicated the information I had obtained to the metropolitan police the same day, and on 4th Sep<lb/>tember Inspector Shaw came down to Portsmouth—Dinham was again sent for to the station, and Shaw saw him in my presence—on 10th Sep<lb/>tember Shaw came again, accompanied by Mrs. Pallant and young Tates—I went with Shaw to Hyslope's place in Lake Road, Landport—Shaw said to him "I have seen your handwriting in the register, the signa<lb/>ture you made when you were married, and an endorsement on a Bank of England note which has been stolen from Mr. Hodgson on Black-heath on 28th May, and in my opinion they are identical." Hyslope replied, "I did not have a note in my possession, and I shall be very glad to have it cleared up, as the boys in the street point me out as one of the highwaymen." He was told he would have to go and put on the clothes he wore when in London—he did so and he was then taken to landport station—he remarked before going that the clothing he had on then was exactly the same as he had in London,-even to the necktie—Mrs. Pallant and Tates were left at the hotel near the station—I told the inspector to get six or seven men as like the prisoner as possible in dress and height, and when they were ready in the reserve room one of the constables fetched Mrs. Pallant and Yates—Mrs. Pallant was shown into the reserve room, and immediately she got in she put up her umbrella and pointed to Hyslope—no suggestions had been made to her to pick him out—I then went into my office with Shaw; I did not see Yates go in, I saw him afterwards; he did not identify any one—the prisoners were then charged with this offence—they made no reply—I had pre<lb/>vionsly been to the shop where Hyslope was employed, and there received this leaf of a book—I showed it to Hyslope—he said "Where did you</p>

Compton, Leslie Street, was written on one of the notes, and J. Compton on the other; that one had been passed in the Mile-end Road to a Mrs. Pallant, and the other to a person named Holloway, somewhere in Portsmouth, but I did not know exactly where—he said he should be very glad if it could be cleared up, because he was pointed at by boys in the street as a person suspected of highway robbery—I said it would be materially in his favour if he could give me a satisfactory account of where he was on the night of 28th May, provided he had not committed the offence—he said he thought he was at the Alhambra, that he went there, I think he said three times—I ultimately took him to the station, and Mrs. Pallant was brought in—Dinham was brought in afterwards—they were put with some other persons in a room—prior to Mrs. Pallant identifying Hyslope I had not communicated to her anything about his appearance, dress, or any<lb/>thing to lead her to identify him.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Dectective Sergeant</hi>). On the 16th July I was at Messrs. Penn's works—-Clarke was brought into the office—the charge was read to him, and he said "All I know about it is Porter said it was a dirty lot, and he must have some allowance for dirt; that he had some overweight always allowed him for dirt, 2 or 3 cwt., I think he said." I took him to the station, and the same evening about 11 o'clock I went to Porter's house, 5, St. George's Terrace, Lewisham—I posted four men round the house—I had great difficulty in getting in—I searched the house, and Porter was found in a cupboard in the scullery by Sergeant Marshall on my presence—he was very violent, and I put handcuffs on him—I was about to read tthe warrant to him—he said "Do not do that, I know all about it: I knew at 11 o'clock to-day that the warrant was out against me, and that Penn's man and Douglas were in custody," or were locked up—I told him he was all on the spiring to steal and with stealing—he said "Well they may talk about conspiracy, I shall be able to prove that the difference—they will have to prove it, and if they say that I gave Peun's men money they will have to prove that too, and it will take you and them all your time. I should have given myself up to you, but I did not want to be locked up all night. I went over the garden wall to my mother's house at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187710220270"/>
               <p>back, and you would not have had me now if it had not been for the policeman you placed under the wall." He got on top of the policeman's back, I believe, as he slipped down—he also said "I cannot under<lb/>stand what Douglas is in custody for, he did not buy the iron, he only had part of the profit, which I gave him." His brother was charged with assaulting me, and referring to that he said "I am sorry my brother struck you, he did it out of love for me, I hope you will not be too hard upon him." He was then taken to the station—on the same day, about 10 o'clock, I took Douglas at Green Bank, Lewisham—he was in bed, but dressed—I told him who I was, and that I was going to arrest him on a warrant for stealing a quan<lb/>tity of iron in April last belonging to Messrs. Penn—I took out the warrant to read to him—he said "Pray don't do that, I know all about it, and have been expecting these proceedings, and I am sur<lb/>prised that Messrs. Penn should take the steps they have for a sum of about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I know the Penn family, and we are to a certain extent intimate." He offered every facility to my searching—his brother came in, and being surprised to see two detectives there, asked me what it meant—I said that I was there to arrest his brother, and he said "Now, Thomas, if there is anything you can tell the officers about this business do so." Thomas said "Well, all I know about it is this: I bid for Peiin's iron, and Porter heard of it. Porter saw me, and said 'What do you want to bid for Porter's iron for, I have had it so long; let me have it this time, I can get some overweight and you shall have part, or half of what I make,' and he afterwards gave me some money, 8<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I don't know which. I do not think there was anything wrong about taking that money, as I advanced him part of the money to pay for the iron, and, of course, I ran a certain risk." He said that he was not fit to be removed—I saw his medical man, and he was left there with an officer in charge of him.</p>

I believe Douglas is a wharfinger—I believe other officers have been to his wharf to make in<lb/>quiries—I only went to his house—he might have learnt that proceedings were going on—there were four or five remands—I was present at all—ths Magistrate did not say on the last remand that there was no case against Douglas—he did not intimate his intention to discharge Douglas or any<lb/>thing to that effect—I think it was on the last hearing that Whitling was produced—the Magistrate had given an intimation about Douglas case on the previous hearing, and then Wickling was produced for the first time, but not in consequence of what the Magistrate said—he was going to be a witness, that was understood, and he was there at each hearing, but his evidence was not given until the Magistrate had given an intimation—he had sworn information.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in Messrs. Penn's employ, and have charge of Evelyn Wharf, Deptford—in April Fennell told me that Mr. Notley had given Porter permission to lay a barge alongside the Evelyn Wharf to load, and the barge was loaded with iron on 17th, 18th, and 19th April—I saw Porter at the wharf two or three times during that time, and I saw Douglas once—they were on the quay close to the edge of the wharf while the loading was going on.</p>

The iron is weighed in the factory—they sometimes weigh the cart and the iron without the horse, and in a great many cases they weigh the cart and the iron—I remember the 19th of April, because on the 18th the horse fell into the barge—I did not see Porter there after that that I remember—he only remained a few minutes.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in partnership with Mr. Whitling—I was manager to the Phoenix Iron Works at that time—prior to April I knew Porter, and had been in the habit of buying scrap iron of him—on 21st April he said he had a cargo coming from Messrs. Penn's, consisting of lump iron, cast iron, iron borings, and wrought iron turnings—on the evening of 19th April he brought a barge, called the Andrew, alongside with the metal as I had arranged—we commenced unloading on the 21st—many men were engaged in it under Verrall's superintendence—a man named Andrews was in Douglas's employ, and was present at the unload<lb/>ing—it was Verrall's duty to see the cargo as it came from the barge and enter it in the landing-book—I observed a conversation going on between Verrall and Andrews, and afterwards saw Porter come to the wharf—I had a conversation with him, and he gave me this invoice. (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 24th April</hi>, 1877, <hi rend="italic">charging iron of different kinds and amounts, making a total of</hi> 104<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less 10 <hi rend="italic">per cent.</hi>, 103<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., credit 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., balance 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">by the large, Andrew, settled by cash</hi> 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. <hi rend="italic">H.

I afterwards got the landing-book from Mr. Verrall, compared the weights, and found that they corresponded—I only paid 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account when the invoice was given me, on account of my suspicion about the weights, but he said that those were the weights which he had already charged—I told him the weight was considerably less than was in the barge, but he said the full weight was there—I said that I should require to see Penn's invoice before I paid the balance, and he said he would bring it the next morning, which he did, and turned down a portion of it where it should be receipted—after he left me I went to the Phoenix Wharf and had the load of iron reweighed, and found out that the weights came out in correspondence with this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I then paid the balance, and on, I think, the 2nd of May I wrote a letter to Porter—I wrote three or four letters to him, and about May 7th he called upon me, and I saw him—I also saw him at the works on 15th May—I said there were 12 tons 18 cwt. short in that barge—he said "The weight is all right; you have got the full weight," and I believe he said "You have made the overweight at Penn's"—he then asked if I would take a bill for the difference, 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said that I had paid him cash, and he must refund the money, which he promised to do next day—he came the</p>

               <p>next day, and said that his mother banked at Deptford, and he had not brought the cash, and made another appointment—he came again on the 15th, and said that Douglas, his partner, was going halves in the trans<lb/>action, and he would see him and get half the amount from him—he also said "I understand you have written to Penn's, or seen Penn's upon the subject of the short weights"—I do not know what was said further—I saw him after that, and he said that the weights had been checked ready, and asked me if I would write to Penn's, and tell Mr. Penn that the mistake was our own, which I refused to do, and said that if the short weight was known to Mr. Penn the man would be discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the City manager to the Phoenix Iron Works Co., at 60, Gracechurch Street—on Saturday, 28th April, Porter called there for payment of his account, and I paid him 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I said that Mr. Freeth was not at all satisfied with the weights of the iron delivered, and he intended going over to Messrs. Penn to see if the amount charged was correct—he said, "For God's sake don't do that, telegraph to Mr. Freeth to see me before he goes"—I declined to tele<lb/>graph and Mr. Freeth came up—before that I told Porter that Mr. Freeth had sent Andrews and Mr. Verrall together, and he thought the weights were not correct—later on the same day Mr. Freeth came in—on 1st May Porter called again for payment of his balance, and I ultimately paid him—I said that we believed we had been robbed in conjunction with Andrews and Verrall—he said, "So help me God, I have only charged you the same weight as Penn's have charged me"—I produced an invoice, turning down a part and showing the weights only—after looking at that I was satisfied—he said, "These are the weights, perhaps you will now be satisfied"—we discharged Verrall—shortly after Porter left I saw Mr. Freeth, who showed me a paper—after that I saw Porter at the wharf—I believe we had then made a claim upon him for 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., the difference between the weight Penn's gave to Mr. Freeth and the weight that Porter had charged us—I said I was very much sur<lb/>prised after a man taking his solemn oath that he had given it, that there was such a discrepancy, because I considered that he had shown us the original invoice—he said that we should not lose any<lb/>thing, or some incoherent statement; but of course I did not believe a word he said after that—he said that I should have to get half of the amount back from Mr. Douglas—he called on me four or five days later at the City office, and promised to pay the 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next day at twelve o'clock—the last day of May, or early in June, I was in the Lombard dining rooms and saw Douglas—I said, "Porter has not paid that money yet"—he fell into a great temper, and seeing he was getting very boisterous I left him sitting where he was, and went into the innerroom—he came after me and sat down by me and said, "Don't you think you are going to frighten Harry Porter out of that 32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I said that I did not want to frighten any one, I only wanted what was right—he said, "You have had your fair weights, you have not been robbed"—I said "If we have not been robbed, who has been robbed"—he said "Penn and Sons have, and they have been for years"—I said, "Well, if Penn and Sons have been robbed, pay them back the money, we only want what is right"—he said."

                  </hi>. I am a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Licentiate of the College of Physicians—I practise at Tunbridge—on Sunday, 30th September, I was called to see the deceased, George Breeze, and I went at 5 o'clock in the evening—he was in his bedroom on the bed, but not quite undressed—he was suffering from the effects of a wound on the inner side of the knee, a little. above the knee, and from the commencement of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremem</hi>—I saw the wound, it was inflamed all up the thigh to the groin—he was partially delirious then—he would rest for a moment, but every second or third question he would answer irrationally—I ascribed that to <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, and prepared for an attack of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, as those are the beginning of the symptoms, and I also treated his leg—I had never seen him before in my life—I noticed nothing else at that time but the delirium and the inflammation of his leg—I next saw him on the following morning, Monday; his condition was then worse in every respect—I had pre<lb/>scribed for him on the Sunday—I treated him with narcotics to try and induce sleep and endeavoued to cut off his alcohol, but it was not cut off—it is common for persons to be afraid of carrying out the doctor's orders—by degrees I stopped it altogether—my orders were slightly disobeyed,' I found that he had whisky or port wine, but not in any large quantity—on the Monday the symptoms of <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> were more marked—I saw him next on the Tuesday morning, when his condition was worse in every respect—his leg was decidedly much worse, there was a great deal of swelling and inflammation—I was with him more than an hour on the night he died, which was early on the "Wednesday morning, and I had also seen him on the Tuesday evening earlier—I was not with him when he actually died, but I was within an hour of his death—he was simply comatose and moribund when I last saw him—I was called in to give a certificate of his death, and my first certificate was <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> simply; I afterwards added to that that the exciting cause of the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was a wound on the leg—I express my opinion now that the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> was caused by the wound.</p>

I think the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> would not have come on at all if it had not been for the wound—the wound provoked the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>, and but for that he would not have died—I am able to say that the alcohol he took afterwards did not aggravate the symptoms—he took—very little. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If you were able to say that but for what he took himself after the wound he would not have had <hi rend="italic">debirium tremens</hi> that would make a great difference?—<hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I believe it was very slight, and it would have very little effect, notwithstanding the little he took after my instructions—if he had not taken that he would still have died from <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—it was certainly not that that caused the <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi>—a bite like that, I believe, is not a dangerous thing, in a healthy person it would produce</p>

                  </hi>. I am an engine-driver in the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway Company's employ—on Saturday, the 14th July last, I took down an engine to fetch a train from Swanley Junction—I had some refreshment that evening at the Bull public-house, near Birchwood Corner—it is kept by a Mr. Hutton—I left that house, a little before nine o'clock, to return to the station—I was not due to leave the station till eleven o'clock—I took a parcel of food from the Bull for my fireman—as I was going along the road to the station I saw two men come towards me on donkeys—I was then about half a mile on my way—I made way for them to pass, and just as I thought they had passed I received a blow on the back of the head; I stumbled forward, and as soon as I could recover myself I turned to look who it was—I saw the faces of both men—one was on a donkey, and the other standing then—they were quite close to me, and I made the remark that it was cowardly for two men to attack a little man like me, and the one on the donkey (Pateman) said "That's the b——y Yorkshireman"—with that they both fell to beating me with sticks and kicking me about the body and head, Pateman having got off the donkey—I was in the road, and they kicked me when I was standing up and when I was down—my hat was lost—they continued to kick and beat me—one of them said "What have you under your coat?" and I told them it was food for my mate—one of them pulled open my coat and took the parcel from me, and by some means or other I managed to get up—as I was running away I received three blows on the side of my head with a stick—the third blow knocked me down again—when I recovered I saw the men going up the hill in front of me—I followed them as well as I could to the Bull—just before they got to the Bull they turned down a lane to the right—that is a lane leaning towards Dartford—one donkey was a lightish one, and the others were more of a brown, darkish—there were three donkeys, but two men—Mr. Hutton took care of me, and had me washed and drove me back afterwards to the station, and I went up to town with my fireman on the engine—I went to Dartford the nest day and lodged a complaint.</p>

I am the brother of the prisoner Thomas—I am also a donkey proprietor and driver, and live near Bromley—it is the custom of myself and brother to go to Swanley Junction with our carts—I did so last summer—on the 14th July I was with Walter Pateman, and we went to the White Hart at Orpington at about 9 a.m., and remained there till 5 p.m.—Orpington is the next station below Chisle hurst, and about three and a half miles from Lullington Castle—when we left at five, we went to Birchwood; we had four donkeys with us—we then went to Swanley, where a society called the Swanley Club meets—it met that night, and we went to the meeting—my brother was at the Club; we met him not much past six—I suppose we left the club at 8.10—the two prisoners, myself, and a man named Bilsby, and we went to the Woodman (Mr. Turner's)—we did not stop there long; we had one pot of beer—we divided our donkey money and went home, straight along that road to the Lullington Castle (<hi rend="italic">showing on the plan</hi>)—we did not go in—we left Pateman behind us, between Mr. Beenham's farm and Mr. Mill's, I remaining with my brother—Bilsby remained with us till we turned into our road, which leads the Heathfield farm—we went to the house-carts, to my mother's first—we told Bilsby to take the donkeys to Swanley—he turned to go; we never turned to see—I suppose it was not quite nine o'clock—it was 8.45 when we came out of Mr. Turner's house, and we had a very short distance to go—we are just at the top of the railway—if trains pass by we could hear them—a train came in soon after we got home, I suppose what they call the 5 to 9 train—when we got to my mother's house there was William Pateman at home, the prisoner's brother, who is married to one of my sisters—my brother stepped indoors—we remained the night—I came out to go and tie my pony up—my brother was up in the van dressed—presently I came back again, and my brother-was still there, and then we stopped all night—my mother was left in the van when I went to tie up the pony—when we first got to the house-cart, Mary Reynolds, my wife, was there, William Pateman, his wife, my sister—I was present when Terry arrested, my brother—some little time after Terry called upon me—Sergeant Fisher was there, and I was arrested, and was handcuffed to my brother and Pateman—I was discharged on Tuesday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am second clerk at Southwark police-court—on 10th September I was present at the hearing of this summons (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>)—it is against William Timmings for unlawfully causing the steam barge Swift to be navigated without having a licensed man on board—the defendant appeared and called the present defendant as a witness on his behalf—he was sworn, and I produce my notes of his evidence. (<hi rend="italic">These being read, stated that the defendant swore that he was on board the barge Swift during her passage up the Thames on 22nd August</hi>, 1877; <hi rend="italic">that he was not navigating the said barge, but was on board the barge Willey, which was being towed by the Swift, and that Benjamin Elliott, the complainant, never came near him or spoke to him on that day.</hi>) The question about Blackfriars Bridge was repeated several times by the Magistrate in my hearing, but the prisoner adhered to his statement that Elliott never came near.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Before the prisoner was examined the Magistrate made some observation about his apparent state—I noticed that his manner in the witness-box was peculiar, as if he had been drinking—I cannot say that the Magistrate was somewhat—exacting in his manner of putting questions—his strangeness did not diminish under the Magistrate's questions, but I cannot say that it increased under them.</p>

I am a licensed waterman and lighterman, of Duke Street, Stamford Street—on Wednesday, August 22nd, I was in a skiff near Cherry Garden pier, and saw the steam barge Swift, belonging to William Timmings, going up the river towards London Bridge, towing the barge Willey with a line—they passed quite close to me, within afew feet, and I saw the prisoner on board the steam barge steering with the wheel—William Timmings, the owner, was also on board, and the engine-driver was at the door of the engine-room—I knew the prisoner and his brother well up and down the river, and knew that William Tim<lb/>mings</p>

               <p>was a licensed waterman, but that the prisoner was unlicensed—in consequence of that I hailed the prisoner but he would not tab notice—he turned his face and spoke to the engine-driver—I could not hear what he said, but the engine-driver went in, and by the difference of the steam from the funnel and the speed she went at I conclude that he put on more steam—I rowed up as close as I could to him and asked him to give me a turn with my headfast, but it was only momentary, for the steam barge dashed by, and I was only rowing a small boat—they steamed away and I followed—they pulled up just before they got to Blackfriars Bridge, and I overtook them—they moored the Willey along<lb/>side a barge of coal to have some coal put into her, and I rowed along<lb/>side the Swift—the prisoner was still on board, and I said to him "Are you aware you are breaking the law, Mr. Timmings, and he said "Get out of it, you scamp, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to be rowing about preventing honest men from earning their living"—I said that he, a non-freeman, was robbing us of our rights and privileges—he made use of a beastly expression and abused me—I said if he used such language I should summons him—he used another expression and told me to go and see his brother, I should find him at the Old Barge House public-house—I afterwards summoned William Timmings, as under the bye-law the owner of the barge is liable, and it came on for hearing on the 12th September at the police-court, and the prisoner was called as a witness for his brother—I have heard read to-day the evidence which he then gave, and it is correct—prisoner was greatly excited, and I believe he had been drinking.</p>

I keep the Antelope public-house at St. Albans—on the night of the 3rd Oct. last I closed my house at about eleven o'clock—at twenty minutes to two I was awakened by some gravel being thrown up at my chamber window—I looked out and saw a policeman standing below—he turned his bull's-eye on and I went down and opened the street door, and the policeman called my attention to the fact of the cellar shutter being lifted up about five inches, and asked me what it meant—I went down in the cellar and there I found the prisoner standing up in the corner—I did not notice whether he had anything in his hand, because the light I had in my hand was very small and the cellar was dark—I said "What are you doing here?"—he made no reply, nor did he move—I then called up the cellar stairs to the policeman—he came down and said "How is it you are down here?" or something to that effect, and his reply was "I came down for a night's lodging"—he appeared to be quite sober—he is a stranger to me.</p>

I am a constable at St. Albans—at about twenty minutes to two on the night in question I noticed the cellar-flap at the Antelope had been lifted a few inches since I last passed—I threw some gravel at the window and eventually I went in the cellar with the last witness—he went down first and I followed a few minutes after and found the prisoner crouched down in the corner and had his shoes in his hand—I asked him what he was doing down there—he said he came down after a rest—I took him in charge—I had seen him that evening previously about 11.15—he asked me if I could direct him to a place where he could get lodgings—I told him to go to the Goat Inn, a lodging-house, but he said he should not go without I went with him—he had had a little to drink, I think.</p>
