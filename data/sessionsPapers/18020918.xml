             sworn. - I am a cooper: On Thursday the 10th of June, about five o'clock in the afternoon, I was looking out at the three story window of the warehouse, and saw the prisoner go out of one warehouse into the other, with a large bundle; I went down below and found the prisoner sitting on a knap-sack of sugar; I pointed him out to a constable, and he was taken away; I found a deficiency in one hogshead, of one hundred pounds, some of it was scattered on the floor.(Thomas Hunter, a constable, produced the property.)</p>

             sworn. - I live at Old Brompton, near Chelsea; I have known the prisoners perfectly well since the middle of May last; Snowden occupied a house adjoining mine, at the end of the garden, and Wood was frequently there; Snowden occupied a stable of mine; on the morning of Wednesday of 25th of August, I went into the hay-lost over the stable, and saw three horses seeding, one was a black horse, apparently a carthorse, and a grey horse feeding from the rack; there was also another black horse, which belonged to Snowden; in the evening of that day, I heard Wood distinctly say to somebody, I cannot say who," I wish they were at home;" but whether he meant the horses or not, I cannot say, and I heard something, which appeared to me as if they were clipping with scissars; the next morning, about six o'clock, I went again to the same place, and the horses were all three gone; Mr. Fillingham's servant afterwards shewed me a cart-horse, which I believe to be one of the horses which I saw in the stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you went into the stable, you had no suspicion that the horses had been stolen? - A. I had not; I thought it was odd that they should be brought there in the night, remain the whole day, and be taken away in the night again.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you in the hay-lost? - A. I suppose five or six minutes; Snowden had promised me the possession of the stable; it wanted some repairs, and I went to see the condition of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You being above the horse, could not discover whether it was a horse, or a mare? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you never said you sold the chaise, and took the note in payment? - A. No, never to any one.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner last year at all? - A. Yes, the first time was the 27th of December.</p>
               <p>Q.Had there been any money transactions between you? - A. He paid one or two days hire for a chaise, at five shillings a day, before he took it out of the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell you he was going to Brighton, and did you not tell him it would be better for him to buy the chaise? - A. Not to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any conversation between your father and him before the chaise was taken away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is your father here? - A. No, he is in France; I never made any proposition to the prisoners to build a chaise for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell him he should have the chaise at forty pounds, if he paid you at a short period? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who brought the note to you, say, that it would be paid when due, and that he should have a doceur, or something of that sort? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was forty pounds a fair ready money price for the chaise? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to Newman's, did you not say, although you have sold the chaise, you have not sold the harness, and desired it to be returned, which was done? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the harness returned? - A. After I had taken the chaise it was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the date of the note? - A. The 5th of August.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was taken into custody before the note became due? - A. Yes, he was.</p>

               <p>I took the chaise home, and went out in it that day; I let it out afterwards, and have not seen it since the 15th, when it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Mackenzie. I cannot tell who I took the chaise from; they would not give me any information about it, and they have served me with a copy of a writ for it; it was a one horse chaise, with horizontal springs, painted yellow and black, and lined with blue cloth, with yellow nails; it was a rumble tumble behind of a peculiar make.</p>
               <p>Newman. That was the make of the chaise I brought on the 5th; Mackenzie insisted on having it; I said I had paid for it, but don't remember any conversation; Edy said, he had bought that chaise of him, which Mackenzie came to claim of me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You gave the fair value for it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Mackenzie acknowledge selling the chaise? - A. He acknowledged taking the draft.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say it was as a consideration for the chaise? - A. Yes, as a consideration for the chaise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Did he not say that, although he had taken it, it was against his will, for that it was left there? - A. He said it was left by the man who brought it, and who insisted on leaving it; he was asked at Bow-street, whether he had taken the draft, and he said, Mrs. Duff's coachman came with it, and he refused to take it, but he would insist on leaving it on the desk.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not this spirit, gin? - A. Yes, it was gin.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had he lived with your master? - A. Twelve or thirteen years, and always had a good character; they had so much sugar and spirit, that I cannot swear to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you undertake to swear that, at the time you felt something at your pocket, the prisoner had removed the pocket-book? - A. I have no doubt of it; his hand was at the very bottom of my pocket, and the book was in his hand; I am sure it is my pocket-book, there are memorandums in it.</p>

Crescent, Kingsland-road; there is only a party-wall that divides my premises from the prosecutor's; on the 23d of July, I saw the prisoner lurking about the gate; I watched a few minutes, and saw him coming out of the yard, and the prosecutor's little girl following him, crying and saying, what shall I do, the house is robbed, and my mammy will beat me; I followed him; two young gentlemen, my parlour boarders, got before him, and he turned back; I stopped him, and asked him if he had taken any thing from the cottage, he was in a violent passion and said, you had better let me go, and kept feeling in his breast pockets with great violence; I took him back into the school-yard, and made him sit down upon a stool; I then saw a watch in his great-coat pocket; I asked him to let me look at it, and he put it in his job; I saw G. S. at the back of it; in the scuffle his hat fell off, and I saw a silk handkerchief in the crown of his hat; I sent for an officer, and he was taken into custody.(Peter Mason, an officer, produced the property, which was identified by Mrs. Goodson.)</p>

             sworn. - On Saturday the 17th of July, about six o'clock in the morning, I apprehended the prisoner at the bar, leaning upon a post by a horse-boiler's door, the horse was at a little distance from him, tied to a post; it was a dark brown horse, which Leake afterwards claimed; I took him into custody, and asked him whose horse it was; he said it was his, that he had bought it at Smithfield, and given three pounds ten shillings for it, three or four weeks before; I then went up to the horse, and saw that his throat was cut, so that I could have put my arm into his belly; his breath came out, he was standing by the post bleeding; I asked him how the horse's throat came to be cut; he said, he went to fetch it to go to work, from Walworth, and found his throat cut, and that was his reason for wishing to sell it; the prosecutor took the horse to the boiler's; I afterwards ordered a man to bring it to the Flyinghorse, in Lambeth-street, close to the office, which he did; some time after that, I took the prisoner before the Magistrate, and he confessed it was all false that he had told me, and then he told me whose the horse was.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here to prove this confession - did you see the Magistrate sign it? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Then, supposing these articles had never been recovered, they would have gone out of the profits of the job? - A. Yes, certainly.</p>

               <p>Q. Look round and say if you can see that gentleman? - A. Yes; that is him, (pointing to the prisoner;) he told me, Mr. Davis had sent him after me, that I had four pounds odd more to receive, and I said, thank God for it; then I went with him to the Baptist-head, Chancery-lane; he said, Mr. Davis used to give a great many bad Banknotes, and as I could not read or write, he would tell me whether they were good or bad.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to go to the Baptist-head for? - A. He said, there was an agent there, who was to pay me; I gave him the notes to tell me if they were good or bad; then he told me to take notice of a public-house opposite, the sign of the Grapes, where he said, I should receive a weekly allowance for my children; I looked across the way, and when I turned round again, the prisoner was gone; I put myself against the wall, and said, I am done; I saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street, and knew him again immediately, he was taken up upon another charge.</p>

               <p>Q.How do you know it? - A. By the make, and by the mark, W. C. it is made particular from any that I ever saw, in the neck gussets; and the collar is different from any I ever saw; I have been accustomed to take care of it, and an certian it is my master's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coleman. On Friday, the 6th, I came home, and on Saturday morning, a person told me there was a person in custody for another offence, and wished I would go and see him; I went to a public-house at Chelsea, and as soon as I saw him, I discovered he had my stocking on; I made him pull them off, and saw they had my mark upon them; they have been in my custody ever since, and I can swear to them being mine.</p>
               <p>Green. I can swear these are the stocking that hung on the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shirt one of them that were at the room door where you slept? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coleman. There were other things found upon him that did not belong to me; he broke open the top of a bureau, and took a key out, but that is not charged.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman in Coleman-street Ward: On the 26th of July last, about three o'clock, I observed a light in the passage of Mr. Randall's house; I stood a few minues, and observed the light put out; I then withdrew a few yards from the door, and the prisoner soon after came out; he said he was servant to Mr. Randall, and would tell his master of my neglect of duty, in not attending to the persons who were making a noise at the door; I asked him where the light was which I had seen in the passage; he said his fellow-servant was gone backward with it; during the discourse, the prisoner ran off from me; I called out to my partner, John Farley, who stopped him, and brought him back to Mr. Randall's, alarming Mr. Randall that his servant had robbed him; then he came down, and said, he was not his servant; we searched him, and found this property; the prisoner owned the next morning every thing, and how he got in; we said nothing to him,nor promised him any favour; no promise was made him; he said, he got up the lamp iron, and entered the window of the drawingroom, which he forced open, got in and took the property; that he then went down into the pantry, and took some more plate, which he found there, and put into his waist and his pockets; that he then came into the passage with a lighted candle, unsastened the door, put his light out, and came into the street; he had a dark lanthorn, and an iron crow, inside his waistcoat, and two table-cloths wrapped round his body, besides four picklockkeys and matches.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: About a quarter past two, on Tuesday, the 7th of this month, I saw the prisoner coming out of his master's shop, and, about fifty or sixty yards from it, I stopped him; he had this bag in his left hand, in which there was twelve pair of men's shoes, six pair of women's shoes, and six pair of boy's shoes; I took them back to the prosecutor, and, on the Wednesday, they were taken before the Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are a City constable? - A. Yes; and have been so seventeen years.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you been indicted? - A. Never; I deny the asstertion; nobody can say that of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been under any charge before the Lord-Mayor, or Aldermen? - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what this man is charged with at present? - A. With felony.</p>

               <p>Q. Of what sort? - A. With a capital offence, of it is proved, as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the indictment read against him? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What is he charged with? - A. With stealing a dozen pair of shoes, and three seven-shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear it read? - A. I did not particularly attend to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know it is confined to shoes? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You know he carries out his master's shoes? - A. Yes; I have frequently seen him going home with work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not see his master by him at the time he took the shoes out of the shop? - A. No, I did not.(The women's shoes identified.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. White. ) Had you given him any orders to take those shoes? - A. No; he had no power to take out shoes without orders from Mrs. White, or me; whether she gave him orders, or not, I cannot tell; I saw him go out with them.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to suffer him to go by you with them? - A.Because I had an officer to secure him.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Were you in a situation that he could see you? - A. Yes; I was not above a yard from the door.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I leave my defence of my Counsel.</p>
               <p>Jury. (To Mr. White.) Q. Did you see the shoes collected together? - A. I did not see him collecting them together, but I saw the bag full concealed in his bed, before he took them out, and I missed the shoes out of their different places.</p>

               <p>GEORGE COWAN sworn. - I am surveyor to the Thames Police; my duty was on the river on the 27th, at night: About one o'clock, I was near London-bridge, and saw a boat row from Freshwharf to the southward; I perceived the boat was loaded, and rowed heavy; we got within a few boats length of her, when I saw something thrown overboard by the two men in the boat, which appeared to be very heavy; I saw the last, which I picked up, and it was a tea-chest, it was flood-tide, and the other parcel was picked up by the waterman, Warwick, and was a chest of tea with the East-India Company's and the ship's marks, which I know; we hauled them in, and gave chase to the persons who had thrown them over; the boat had rowed into Battle-bridge, Southwark; we could not see the men, but they run over the crast; I followed in, and found a boat there, booked to the crast; I cannot say I had seen the boat before, but I found this piece of a tea-chest in the boat,(produces it), and some loose tea; I afterwards examined the chests, and one had lost the top, and another the bottom; the lead is entire of one, and the other has received damage; I tried this piece of wood to one, and it sits very well, and the tea corresponded in quality; I took the chest to the office, and after I left it there, I went to the Company's wharf to enquire if any crast had been robbed; I found them all secure at Somer's quay; next morning, I saw the Essex hoy had swing among the Gravesend boats; I went to the house of the prisoner, in consequence of information, about eight o'clock, near to Battle-bridge, but did not see the prisoner till the 16th of August, between one and two o'clock, when I apprehended him in Amelia-row, St. George's-fields, with a girl; I got into the house after difficulty; I took him, after resistance, to my boat at St. Olave's stairs; he said, if I had known you had wanted me so long, I would have come forward, for you have nothing against me; I said I had been at his house every day, and his mother said he should come forward; says he, you have nothing against me, you did not find the sculls in my boat; I said I knew nothing of that, for there were no sculls in the boat when I found it; they were wet, when brought back to me, and one had the name of William Thorley. I took him to the office.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You were five or six boats lengths behind when something was thrown out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You took both chests up? - A. Yes, which delayed us a little; the boat was in sight, about twenty yards distance, but I did not see the men, for it was dark; when we got to the crast, there was only one boat outside of it; as to the piece of tea-chest, I will not swear it belongs to either of these chest, but I think it does.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You don't think it a very extraordinary thing for watermen to borrow boats of one another, to commit robberies? - A. I cannot say; it may be so.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect being near that house about the end of August? - A. On Tuesday, the 31st of August, about eleven in the forenoon, I was in my own privy, where I had a view of the door of Mr. Brady's house; I saw the prisoner go in at the front door.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. No; but I am sure he is the man; he went in at the front door, he had an instrument in his hand, which I saw him very plainly move; the door opened; and he went in.</p>
               <p>Q.Was any body with him? - A. There was another in company, but he did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the door shut afterwards? - A. Yes; as soon as I saw him go in, I called to my man that was at work for me in the shed, and told him to bring a stick, and follow me immediately, for there was a thief gone into Mr. Brady's house; I immediately ran, and called upon Fitzgeorge; as I went along, I desired Fitzgeorge to go round to the back door, and sent my man to watch upon the wall even with the front of the house; and I kept the front door myself; I had alarmed all the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try the door to see if it was fast? - Yes, and it was fast.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the door at which the man had gone in? - A. Yes; I might wait five, or six, or ten minutes, for any thing I know, or somewhere thereabouts; people came about, but nobody would believe there was any body in the house; my man was impatient, he jumped down from the wall, and looked through the key-hole; I immediately looked through the key-hole, and saw a man; I desired one of the people to fetch an axe, and I would break the door open on a minute, and immediately upon that, the door was opened from within; the prisoner forced himself against me, and tried to force me backwards; my man immediately assisted me, and we took him; Fitzgeorge and I searched the house; I left the prisoner in custody of my man.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe? - A. I observed the bed thrown off the bedstead on to the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in the upper chamber? - A. In the one pair of stairs room; the sheets and blankets were on the floor, on the right hand, by the side of the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they loose upon the floor? - A. All, except the bolster and one blanket, and a matrass, which were on the bedstead.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they folded up, at all? - A. No; loose in a heap; then we took the prisoner to Worship-street; I saw him searched, and there were found upon him two picklock keys, and an iron crow, one of the keys had a double end.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they? - A. They were in his breeches pocket, between the breeches and the lining; one key and the crow were on one side, and the other key on the other side.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Courthorpe. Q.These things appeared to be just thrown down, in such a way that the person last up might have thrown them there? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. You had not previously locked the door? - A. No, I had not.</p>

               <p>Q.Speak of the house where the wife lived? -The house that the prisoner went into, is not the house Mrs. Brady lived in; there is a party-wall between the two houses; it is now Mr. Brady's</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he had it in his possession for the use of his own family? - A. I cannot say; I think, as near as I can recollect, five or six months, I am not certain; it adjoins to his own garden, and the green-house extends from Mr. Brady's house to this little house adjacent; I went with another man, a baker, and fixed him upon the wall while I went over into Mr. Morris's garden, and just as I was jumping over the sence, the man had unlocked the door, and came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see who the man was that came out? - A. I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you, or Burland, first go up stairs to the bed-room? - A. We all three went up togethers, as near as could be; I found the clothes and the bed on the floor, except the pillow, which laid upon the matrass, with a blanket solded up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner searched? - A. No; I left Mrs. Marsom, and other people, to take care of the house till somebody came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment of the whole of these things? - A. The three blankets were worth at least a guinea and a half, and I would not make the bed under ten pounds.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BRYANT sworn. - On the 17th of August, I was coming from Knightsbridge, and went to the sign of the Turk's-head, in a street that goes up to Bloomsbury-square.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay any time in this public-house? - A. Yes, it was about half-past eight when I came out; when I went in, I called for a pint of porter.</p>
               <p>Q. How much had you? - A. Three or four pints, I don't know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober when you went out? - A. I cannot say I was sober, because I had been drinking a little.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the prisoner? - A. He was in the same public-house, in a corner, all the time; he wanted to introduce himself to me, and I told him several times to keep his own company, and he was not content with that, but he took up the pot and drank; when I went away, as I was going out, the door was half open and half shut, when the prisoner passed me; and as he passed me, he put his hand into my waistcoat-pocket, and took hold of a silver watch that I had in my pocket, and a pair of silver buckles; I took hold of him directly, and he strucke me; he used very bad expressions, and said, if I did not let him go, he would have my life; I struck him several times myself; two more then came up to his assistance, and he got away; he ran down the street, and I after him, and the watchman caught hold of him; then some others endeavoured to rescue him from the watchman, and he ran into a public-house, in St. Giles's, the Black dog; I pulled out my handkerchief to wipe the blood off my face, and the prisoner run up stairs; in about two minutes, I went up stairs and found the prisoner undrest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find your watch and buckles? - A. No; the man that came to his assistance, ran away.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There were about a dozen girls of the town in the house, and he was handing the watch and buckles about to the girls.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you in the street, when Bryant was pursuing the prisoner? - A. No; I was coming down Bowl-yard, and, at the Black-dog, I saw a number of people round the door; I heard a young man had been robbed; I went into the house, and asked the landlord where the young man was; he was in the bar; I went up stairs, and in the room, behind the chair, I found the prisoner, with his coat, waistcoat, and shirt off, fitting down upon the ground, in the room, there was part of an old black coat and an apron; the prosecutor identified him immediately; I took him into custody, and searched him, but found nothing upon him.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Bryant.) How was the prisoner dressed at the publie-huose, where you were fitting? - A. The room was dark, it appeared to be a dark coat, and a black apron.</p>

Yes; On the 2d. of August, the prosecutor brought the prisoner to me; he said, he had been robbed of four half guineas and two seven shillings pieces; I asked him what it was contained in; and he said, it was contained in a white rag purse; I searched the prisoner, and in his right hand waistcoat pocket, I found half-a-guinea in gold, five shillings in silver, and four-pence halfpenny in copper; upon searching him further, in his left-hand pocket, I found a woman's hussif, I selt it, and said; here is some money in this thing; he said, he did not know that there was any money at all; I said, I am sure there is; then he said, I believe there is a sevenshilling piece; I then took hold of the rag, and shewed it the prosecutor; he said, that was not his rag; I then unrolled it to see the contents, and found there was another rag in it; I asked him if that was his; and he said, he would swear to it; I found in that a penny-piece, a half-crown, and two seven-shilling pieces; (produces it).</p>
               <p>Q.(To Welch). Look at that purse? - A. I know it to be mine by a hole near the top of it.</p>

               <p>Q.(To Welch). Do you undertake to swear positively to it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>THOMAS FLETCHER sworn. - Q. What have you to say against the prisoner? - A. On Sunday the 8th of August, I was coming home from Blackwall to Chancery-lane, about half past twelve o'clock at night; I was knocking at my own door in Chancery-lane, where I have a lodging; the prisoner at the bar came up to me, and said, are you locked out? I said, yes; the prisoner said, I am chamber-maid at an inn, in Holborn, I can help you to a very good bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you waited some time at the door? - A. I had been some time at the door; I told her, I should go, and she went along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had that lodging in London, long? - A. Yes, a good many years.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been used to London? - A. Yes, a good many years; I went with her to the <placeName id="t18020918-68-crimeloc354">French Horn in Holborn</placeName>

               <p>Q. Did she say what you were to pay for it? - A. Two shillings; She came up again, and said, her mistress thought the seven-shilling piece was a bad one; she gave me back the seven-shilling piece, and I gave her two shillings, and a shilling for her self.</p>
               <p>Q. When she brought back the seven-shilling piece, were you in bed? - A. No, I was sitting by the side of the bed; she took the three shillings, and went down stairs, wishing me a good night.</p>
               <p>Q. Leaving you alone in the room? - A. She left me alone in the room, I then undressed myself, and looked for a fastening to the door, but could not find any thing; I put a chair against the door, and then went to bed; the next morning, about half past five o'clock, I awaked; I had put my clothes on a chair by the bed-side; the first thing I did, was to look at my pocket-book in my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last before seen the pocketbook? - A. Before I set off from Blackwall, on the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time you felt the pocketbook? - A. When I pulled off my clothes, I am sure I had it in my pocket then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you miss that pocket-book? - A. No, I did not miss it; I looked into it, when I was getting up, and missed nine one-pound notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing else? - A. No, I found the door a-jar, and the chair moved a little on one side; I then went down stairs to the mistress of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found a woman you supposed to be the mistress of the house? - A. Yes; I called her up; she got up, I told her what had happened, and she sent a black servant that she had, to different lodging-houses, to find out the prisoner, but we did not find her till the Tuesday morning, about nine o'clock; I asked her what she had done with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with you? - A. Yes, the black servant and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say? - A. She gave no answer at all about it; I staid there while an officer was sent for, and she was taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any of your notes again? - A. Yes, the same morning, a man of the name of Bradley, who keeps a public-house, shewed me one of my notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who has that now? - A. The constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober at the time? - A. I cannot say I was very sober.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not to sleep with the prisoner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You went with her as the servant of an inn? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And she was only in the room with you for the purpose of shewing you the bed, and bringing the seven-shilling piece back again? - A. For no other purpose at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to remember that you put the chair against the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say you had those notes in your pocket-book, when you went to bed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose, it was while you were asleep, that she took it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say, before the Magistrate, that you had every reason to believe the prisoner stole and carried away your notes at the time she returned into the room with the seven-shilling piece? - A. Not the second time; I said, I supposed she returned again after that.</p>
               <p>Q. When she took the three shillings, was your coat upon your back? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you suppose she could not have taken it at that time? - A. No, it was impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk with her from your lodgings to the French-horn? - A. Yes; it is not above an hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk arm-in-arm? - A. No, I think she walked before me.</p>

It is not the French-horn inn at present, the licence is taken away; the prisoner at the bar lodged there: On Monday, the 9th of August, she came to me to pay me a trifle of money that she owed me, thirteen-pence halfpenny; she gave me a one-pound note to change, I gave her change, and gave the note to my wife; she put it into her pocket-book; the next day she gave me the note again, and I took it before the Magistrate.</p>

               <p>Q. What time did you go to bed? - A. I locked up the cellar, and saw all safe, at a quarter past eleven, or somewhere thereabouts; I always go down stairs the last thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How is the entrance into the cellar fastened?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180038"/>- A. By two bolts; it was a door opening upon the pavement, in Parker's-lane; it is a corner house.</p>
               <p>Q. That was fastened with a bolt on the inside? - A. Yes, with two bolts.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they fastened when you went to bed? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Were you alarmed by any thing? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you called up? - A. Yes, at four o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q.How did you find your house? - A. A lodger called me up, when I found the bar and street door open.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they fastened over night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other part of your premises open? - A. The cellar door at the bottom of the stairs was open.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean the stairs leading from the house to the cellar? - A. Yes; the cellar flap was open.</p>
               <p>Q. That is outside, next to the street? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the bolts? - A. They were unbolted, and the flap shut to again, but the bolts not bolted.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any marks of violence? - A. A small part of the flap of the door was cut away, and part of the door split, then some instrument had been put in, and the bolts shoved back.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the door at the foot of the cellar stairs? - A. It locks into a large staple, and the lock was shoved back.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that he shoved back by any person who was in the cellar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else? - A. We found these shoes (producing a pair of old dirty shoes), laying under the slap of the cellar, very wet and dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing more? - A. No. thing in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing? - A. In the bar we found two drawers were taken away; the bottom part was locked, but the window that pulls down was not locked, for I had broke the lock the day before, (two draweres produced); this drawer contained the penny pieces and new halfpence, and this contained the old halfpence and farthings; the middle drawers were opened, the papers turned out, and twelve metal table-spoons taken away; in the left hand drawer was an old tin nutmeg grater, which I had seen at eleven o'clock that night.</p>
               <p>Q.When you first came down stairs, was it dark or light? - A. It was quite light then; I went outside the door, and immediately two watchmen came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with them in search of the thieves? - A.Immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did they carry you to? - A.Down Parker's-lane, and through Cross-lane, into Lewkner's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen went with you? - A. Two at first, but we were joined by another on the right hand side, pointing to a house, one of the watchmen said, there is one of them in that passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the street door open? - A. Yes; we forced our way into the back parlour, and found the whole of the prisoners there, except Elizabeth Laue.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner were they employed, and in what parts of the room? - A.Elizabeth Ealey was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds were there in the room? - A. One.</p>
               <p>Q.Was she dressed or undressed? - A.Undressed; one of the men was upon the bed likewise, but I cannot swear to which.</p>
               <p>Q. In the bed or on the bed? - A. On the bed; he was dressed; Griffiths was standing against the window, with his arms across, looking towards the table; Reynolds was at the table, counting the money, without shoes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they dressed? - A. All the men were dressed; the penny pieces were arranged up in rows, and they were counting the money before them.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not examine Reynolds's feet or stockings? - A. No, we were glad to secure them; Smith had made his escape up the chimney, before I got into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did he come down the chimney? - A. In about ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come down of his own accord? - A. No, by frightening; as he went up the chimney, the halfpence kept tumbling down out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.That caused you to look up the chimney? - A. He had been seen to go up, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came down, what did you find upon him? - A. I did not search him, I was in the street, and had got hold of some of the others; we were glad to secure them, so that I did not take notice of any other positions.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you first see Elizabeth Lane? - A. She first came to clear her character up of her own accord.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first find the drawers? - A. They were found in Stonecutter's-buildings.</p>
               <p>PRIAM DOWLAN sworn. - Q. Are you a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your stand? - A. I watch in Great Queen-street and in Little Queen-street, as far as Lincoln's-inn-fields, on the other side.</p>
               <p>Q. Before Skillecorn came out of his house, and spoke to you, had you, in the course of the night, made any observation upon any person being about that spot? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180039"/>Q.Give an account of it? - A. I made an observation.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night? - A. About twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you observe? - A. I saw Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him? - A. No, I saw him come from the corner of Mr. Hunter's, the baker's, till he came as far as the shoe-maker's shop, then he crossed over the way, and saw me in my box, upon which he went round, till he came to Skillecorn's, the publican.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you observed, before you received an alarm? - A. I heard an alarm, as I was standing at the corner; I heard Elizabeth Lane, to the best of my opinion, by her voice, for I have known her three or four years, though I cannot swear home to her, say, d-n your eyes, Jack, now is the time to make your ground good, for the watchman is out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it day-light? - A. Between day and dark; it was so dark, he got out of my fight round the corner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any man there? - A.Reynolds I saw before, and I saw him cross from Stonecutters-buildings, where he did the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you saw a woman, and heard her say something? - A. I did not say I saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat the words she said? - A. D-n your eyes, Jack, now is the time to make your ground good, for the watchman is out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you see any body to whom she said that? - A. I saw Reynolds cross over the way at that time, and I pursued him with a rattle; he ran across the way to the corner of Parker's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body else, except the two you have mentioned? - A. I kept up the rattle, and kept him in view till the turning a coal-shed, when he got into a place, called Gold-beater's-alley; I was afraid of being murdered, and did not go up there; I went back to look for the woman, where she used to be, as I did not see her go into the alley, and Reynolds came up to me with shoes on as slippers, and his stockings quite wet; as soon as I saw him, I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they shoes or slippers which he wore? - A. They were shoes, but he wore them as slippers, with the heels down, they did not sit him at all.</p>
               <p>Q.How long did he remain there? - A. A very few minutes; I told the constable how I had seen him about; he examined him, but found nothing on him, so let him go; he and I came together from the watch-house, and when I came to the corner, he said, Dowlan, I believe you are an honest watchman, and I will treat you to-morrow night; I said, I wanted no treat from him, for I worked for that with which I could treat myself; well, says he, I will give you a shilling, which I also refused; I then came on to the corner of Parker-street, where I saw one of the Bow-street officers in the buildings, who had found the drawers, after I had let Reynolds go; I marked the house Reynolds went into.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you with the officer, when he found the drawers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. After having met the officer, where did you go? - A. I went to the watch-house with the drawers, and then came back.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go next? - A. I came back again, as far as the Running-horse, and stood there; there was a man, who lodged with Skillecorny, came out with Skillecorn to the door; I asked them, if they knew of any person being robbed, and if they did, that the drawers' were in the watch-house; then Skillecorn told me, he was the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you take them to? - A. I told him, if he would come along with me, I dare say I could find out the thieves, or the people that had robbed him; but that it was no use to go one or two together, for we must get some more assistance; I got two watchmen, and we went up to Lewkner's lane, but it is wrote up, Charles-street; when we came opposite the door where I saw Reynolds go in, on this side of Goldsmith's-alley, Riley spied me, and said, here is Dowlan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say so? - A. Yes; he ran back, and made the alarm to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him, did you? - A. Yes; I did not see him in the room, but I found him under the stairs, in the house, covered over with straw.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first heard him say, here is Dowlan, where was he, did you see him? - A. He was in the passage, and run back directly; I never gave the door any time till I burst it open, and told the rest to follow me.</p>
               <p>Q. You run into the room? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. In that room who did you find? - A.Samuel Beach.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing? - A. As soon as I came into the room, he jumped from the bed where he was, with some money, and threw it upon the table where the remaining part of the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him? - A. I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else did you see? - A. I saw that small chap of a boy, Charles Smith.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing? - A. As soon as he had an opportunity, he got up the chimney.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him go up? - A. No, but I found him there, and I saw him when I first went into the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Who else did you find? - A. This young man, in a brown coat, Butcher Grissiths.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing? - A. He was standing between the window and table, where the money was dividing in penny-pieces, and Beach threw a cover over it, a sort of cloth; he wore a sailor's jacket at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180040"/>Q. Did you see either of the other prisoners? - A. Yes, I saw Reynolds opposite the fire place.</p>
               <p>Q.What was he doing? - A. I said, Reynolds, above all, if you stir out; I will lose my life, because I know you to be a thief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else - was Riley there? - A. I cannot say; the other chap, in a blue-coat, Roberts, was standing near to Griffiths.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in bed? - A.

               <p>Q. Have you named all the prisoners? - A. No; the other man lay between the window and the table, on the ground, on the boards, his name is William Herbert.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any persons at the bar, whom you did not see in the room? - A. I don't know whether Riley was in the room or not, but Elizabeth Lane was not there; we found Riley, afterwards, under the stairs, covered over with a little straw.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the chimney while you were in the room? - A. I did; Herbert lay between the table and the window, I told him to get up, and one of them said, that man was drunk; I said, if he was drunk, I would wake him; I pulled him up, and handed him into custody, telling them to take him along with the rest, and take care of them; before he was taken out, he said, there is a silver shilling on the bed, which don't belong to the property, let me have it; I went to the bed, found the shilling, and gave it him; Smith got up the chimaey, and I heard the halfpence and penny pieces falling down, he goes by the name of Black Charles, because he is a sweep; I told him to come down, but he made no answer; upon which, I told the other watchman to go up stairs, (for I was afraid he would get off) and throw the chimney down upon him, and smother him; I took some wood, and told him, I would set it on fire, and bring him down, if he would not come; upon those conditions, he came down, and delivered to me, ninepennyworth of halfpence and penny pieces, saying, there is only nine-pence on me, that is all I have, you can neither hang me not transport me; before Reynolds went, he threw off his top coat and waist coat into a chair, in which there was about the amount of five shillings, and said, you found no money on me; and with that he dropped this nutmeg greater, (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing in the pocket either of his coat or waistcoat? - A. Yes, copper penny pieces and halfpence, there was better than five shillings; I swore only to five shillings, but I dare say there was very near nine shillings; as he stood with his back to the chimney, he dropped this nutmeg-grater out of his left hand; I took it up, and said, Skillecorn, is this your property? yes, said he, I will swear to that being my property; we then took them to the watch-house, and all the money I found, I laid before the constable.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say so? - A. No, I said, I saw him drop it, and I took it up.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon being called, where did you go to? - I was crying two o'clock, when I heard the rattle going, I ran through the passage between King-street and Lewkner's-lane, and asked Dowlan what was the matter; he told me, there was such a person passed, and mentioned Reynolds and Lanc, and that they had got into the passage; I did not see Bet Lane till she gave herself up at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the other persons to the house where the prisoners were taken? - A. Yes, to Watkins's house.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you go in at the same time? - A. Yes, I was along with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in that room, see all the prisoners, or how many of them? - A. I saw six of them, and one woman, who was in bed, with her head against the wall, but I cannot say whether she was asleep, or not.</p>

               <p>Q.What was he doing? - A. To the best of my knowledge, he was sitting against the window, but he got up when I got in; I took hold of Beach.</p>

               <p>Q.Where was he? - A. He was sitting on the bed, I took hold of him, and told him to get up.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what the others were about? - A. I guarded the door; and my partner knows more about it than I do.</p>
               <p>Dowlan. I handed them to his, and he took care of them.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HUGGENS sworn. - Q. Are you a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go with the other watchman and Skillecorn to the house in Lewkner's-lane? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180041"/>Q. Did you go into the room? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go after Donald, or with him? - A. I went along with him.</p>
               <p>Q.What did you first observe? - A.When I first went in, I saw the money divided into heaps on the table which was in the room, and there were five of the prisoners about the table, where the money was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they sitting or standing? - A. There were four standing about the table, and one laying at the end of the table; when Dowlan and I went into the room, we immediately seized on one or two of them; Herbert was laying at the end of the table, between the table and the window; one said, he was drunk, then said Dowlan, if he is, he must get up; upon which he got up, and said, don't take me away, for there is a silver shilling of mine here, that don't belong to the money.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you find the shilling? - A. We found the shilling, and he got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find it? - A. In the bedclothes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take them away? - A. We had not, as we thought, force enough to take them, being such a number as they were, for we had three watchmen only, till Skillecorn took the rattle and sprung it in the street, and some others came up and assisted us; then, while we were getting ourselves ready, and putting the money into a handkerchief, a nutmeg-grater sell out of Reynolds's pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it? - A. Yes, I saw it fall out of his hand or pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Out of which hand? - A. I believe it was his left-hand, or left-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took it up? - A. The watchman, of the name of Dowian, and asked Skillecorn if it was his property, and he said it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you took them away? - A. Then we handed them one by one to the watchmen at the door, in the street; at the time we handed the first out, the smallest of them, Smith, got up the chimney, I saw the foot, and the copper-money falling down.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after you came into the room was it, that Smith was getting up the chimney? - A. I suppose it might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him in the room before he got up the chimney? - A. I did; I saw him standing at the table when we entered the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him come down the chimney? - A. Yes; we told him to come down, or that there were people at the top of the house that would throw the chimney down on him; but he kept going up, and after we had secured the rest, there being some old boards in the room, we threatened to set them on fire, upon which he came down, and said, I give myself up to you, I have only ninepence on me, you can neither hang or transport me for that, upon which we took him away, and put him with the rest; there was a bed in the room, which was very small, and on the bed there was a sailor, dressed in a blue jacket, and a woman lying in the bed on her left side, with her face to the wall; we took him likewise, and put him with the rest; when we broke into the room, I verily believe the woman was asleep, and did not know any thing of it.</p>

             sworn. - Q.What are you? - A. I am a constable of the night, and was present when the prisoner were brought into the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect Reynolds, one of the prisoners, being brought in earlier by one of the watchman? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. You examined him, and finding nothing on him, you discharged him? - A. Yes, by the consent of the watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect what situation he was in as dress? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what time in the morning it was? - A. I believe, turned of one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark? - A. Dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the property being brought in? - A. Yes, I had them all searched, and I found halfpenny, and penny-pieces only on one.</p>
               <p>Q. Which was that? - A. That was Roberts; I found nothing on either of the others.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the things distinguished at all from the others? - A. No, they were all put together.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the watch-house, when Elizabeth Lane first appeared? - A. No, I was going to take the charge to the Magistrate; I saw her in the passage; I asked her what she did there; she said, she came to resign herself up, for she heard we wanted her.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was that? - A. About half-past eleven o'clock, as we were going to take the charge from the watch-house to the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you take charge of the drawers and the halfpence, and the penny-pieces? - A. Of the halfpence and penny-pieces, but not of the drawers, they were given back to Skillecorn, because he wanted to use them; here are the halfpence and penny-pieces which I have had in my possession ever since.

             sworn. - Q. What are you? - A. An officer belonging to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being met by a watchman, and his taking you to look for some drawers? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know? - A. It was during the election, and as I was going home, about half-past two in the morning, I went down Little Queen-street, and through Stone-cutter's-buildings, where, by accident, I saw three drawers.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180042"/>Q.Was it light or dark? - A. It was just greylight; I saw a penny piece on the ground, which I picked up, and on looking further, I found four more; feeling about, I found seven halfpence, and one drawer, and looking further, I found the other box, on a piece of timber, which lay in the street; I kept them in my possession till I went before the Magistrate, and the publican wanting them, I was ordered to mark them, and let him have them, which I did; these are the drawers; I found some papers concerning a cloath's-club, which the publican swore to, they were laying near the drawers.</p>
               <p>MARGARET WALKER sworn. - Q.What do you know of this transaction? - A. I know nothing very particular, except that I live in Stonecutter's-street, and was sitting up that night to get my son's breakfast, who belongs to the army, and was going to a review very early in the morning; the watch being close to me, and about a quarter before two, I heard a noise, upon which I went to the door, where I saw a person rapping; I asked him what he wanted, he said, nothing; I then went into the kitchen, and saw all the fastenings safe; in the course of a little time, I heard a great noise, and heard that the watchman had taken a man up upon suspicion of a robbery, and that some halfpence had been found with the drawers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the person who spoke to you at the door? - A. Yes, I know him now.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he one of the prisoners? - A. No; I thought I would call the watchman to tell me who it was, when I understood they had taken the persons, who, I suppose, I had heard, and that the person I had spoke to belonged to Bow-street; I was desired to go to the watch-house, to declare what I had heard, and as I followed them, they went into a house, in Parker's-lane, and took the prisoners; as I was waiting, I discovered something laying near my foot, in a handkerchief, which I picked up and took to the watch-house, where it was examined, and contained the farthings.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Skillecorn.) Did you receive a handkerchief from the last witness? - A. Yes, this is it.(Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Who does it belong to? - A. Nobody owns it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was in it when she gave it you? - A. some farthings, but I don't know how many.</p>
               <p>Q. Are those the drawers you lost out of your bar that night? - A. Yes, they are, I locked them up about a quarter before twelve.</p>
               <p>Q. You spoke of there being a quantity of halfpence, penny-pieces, and farthings in those drawers? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. To what amount? - A.About two poundsworth, or more, but I am sure there was that; there might be fifty shillingsworth, but I am positive there were above two pounds.</p>
               <p>Q.Was there any particular piece among them? - A. Yes, it is like a something, it is Sir Isaac Newton's model; I received it that night for a pint of beer, and have received it twenty times over from one man, nobody else would take it.</p>
               <p>Q. That was in the drawer? - A. It was in a little bowl in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q.Where did you find it? - A.Amongst the rest of the money, upon counting it out in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you say to the nutmeg-grater? - A. I have had it these eighteen months, sometimes it was in the drawer, and sometimes I wore it in my pocket, on that night it was in the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember receiving it again that night, when the men were taken up? - A.Dowlan gave it me in the room; he asked me, if I knew it, I said, I did; I saw him stoop to take up something, but I did not see it dropped.</p>
               <p>Reynolds. Q. I wish to know what mark he knows the nutmeg-grater by? - A. In the first place it is nearly worn out, and it is difficult to shut; in the next place, the corners are so sharp, that it tears my pocket all to pieces, therefore I did not carry it for some time.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Those shoes were not fitted on them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Herbcross defence. I am a labouring man, Griffiths and I was going into the country to harvestwork, and he asked me to call for a shirt, which he had left to be washed; I said, I did not care, but he must make haste to be in time to go in the waggon; I went with him to this room, and had not been there long before the watchman came in and took us all.</p>
               <p>Griffith's defence. I am a butcher, and did work in Clare-market, but having hurt my leg, I could not follow that business; wanting my shirt washed, I found out that one of these women took in washing, and when I was going to fetch it, I asked Herbert if he would go with me, which he did, and we were taken.</p>
               <p>Reynolds, Beach, Riley, Smith, and Roberts, declined saying any thing, and Lane, and Easley were not put on their defence.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other persons in the shop? - A. There were other persons in the shop, but no one saw him besides me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know what the parcel contained at that time, or only that he took a parcel? - A. I knew what it contained, for it was packed up and directed, I had seen it packed up that same morning.</p>

               <p>Q.When he had taken up the parcel, what did he do? - A. He walked out immediately, and said nothing; I called up one of our young men, and we pursued him and took him with the dimity, which is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking or running? - A.Walking across the street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. I asked him where he was going with that parcel, he made for answer, "all's well;" then I took him back to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing more pass? - A.Nothing more except that; I sent for an officer, and he was taken to Marlborough-street, where he was examined the same evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him? - A. He would reply to nothing we asked him, but made as if he was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know him before? - A. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lives in this shop, in Bond-street? - A. Mr. Whitten and Mr. Bremridge both live in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the shop part of it? - A. Yes, it is, the bottom part.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the dimity? - A. The value of it is six-pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the selling price? - A. It is the cost price, the manufacturer's price.</p>

               <p>Q. You did not see him in the shop? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Q. You can say nothing more than the last witness? - A. Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be sober? - A. I believe so, he was walking very steady when we overtook him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - A. He only once said, all was well; I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, all I can say is, that I have been at sea eight years, and was never known to do any thing dishonest, nor can any thing be alledged against me, except this; unfortunately I fell into my ship-mate's company, and they gave me liquor, which made me stupid; I really did not know what I was about.</p>

            , of the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury, in the County of Middlesex, bachelor, and Mary Price, of this parish, spinster, were married in this church, by licence, on the 15th of April, 1802.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. My Lord, I shall trouble you with very few observations: When I became acquainted with my first wife, I was but 19 years of age, and was a dupe to a woman of the most depraved character; the represented herself to be a woman of respectability; but I found her mistress to be a kept woman, and she herself a woman of loose manners; I was unnable to support her in her extravagance, being only an articled servant; she stripped me of every thing I had, and went away, declaring, by an oath, she would never return; this is three years and a half ago, and I have never seen her till this time; and I frequently heard she was dead; I did not marry the second wife till after I heard of the death of the former, after a knowledge of her for a year and an half; I had no interested motive in this marriage, quite the contrary, she has not fortune or expectancy; it was a marriage of affection; we lived amicably together, and by my industry, were getting forward in the world.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q.(To O'Donnel). Did his first wife live with him? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q.How did they live together? - A. That is unknown to me; perhaps they would quarrel, but their family affairs I have nothing to do with.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you not represented her to be a very abandoned and drunken woman? - A. I know nothing of her character; I know nothing that is dishonest of the woman, she might drink for what I know, I have seen her take a glass many times, that is nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is she an abandoned woman? - A. I never saw any thing dishonest or disgraceful, only just taking a glass, which many women are liable to.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they live together? - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she a drunken woman? - A. I never saw her, to say drunk, in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us how many glasses of liquor have you seen her drink one after another? - A. Not more than three, one after another.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said, she lived in a bawdy-house? - A. He told me so, I had nothing but his word for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Is she a married woman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Does she live in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 5th of August, where did you see the prisoner? - A. I was standing in the kitchen; between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner come down the area steps, he was dressed like a butcher; I observed him coming down, and not seeing him come forward into the kitchen, I went out, knowing the pantry-door was not locked, and met him coming out of the pantry; I asked him what brought him there; he said he was looking after Lady Walker's housekeeper, and he thought that was her room.</p>
               <p>Q. Does Lady Walker lodge in the same house? - A. No, nor ever did; I put my hand upon his breast to stop him; he stepped back, and I pulled the pantry door to, and locked it, it was a halfwire door, and I saw him put his hand into his apron-pocket, and take out some spoons, and put them down upon the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose plate was this? - A.Captain Robinson had the use of it from Miss Mackenzie; it was her plate.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you keep the plate? - A. In that pantry.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine him? - A. No, I did not; he laid it on the table.</p>
               <p>Q.Are you sure he took the plate out of his pocket? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the plate have been seen from the street? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the pantry did you keep it in? - A. On the shelf in the pantry; I kept him there till after five o'clock, locked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who opened the door? - A. My master, or Major Roberts, I don't know which; I went in with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the plate lying when you went in? - A. Where he had put it, on the table.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took it? - A. I took it up first in my hand, (produces the property); three table-spoons were marked with the name of the lady that kept the house before Miss Mackenzie; the other tablespoon has Miss Mackenzie's mark, and the teaspoons; the tongs have no mark; I am sure they are the same spoons that I had under my care.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was sent by Mr. Marshall, in Carnaby-market, to Lady Walker's, for orders about some lamb that was to come the next day;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180055"/>I went into this room, thinking that was the room, and this young man locked me in, and said, I wanted to rob the house.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever lose fight of him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Budgell.) Where did you find these things? - A. He chucked them down in the area.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Can you swear I was the person you saw at the window? - A. Yes, I can.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I had been from sea but three weeks; I heard the alarm of stop thief, several people were running, and I run with them.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mackenzie.) Was there any body else running when he passed your door? - A. No, not at that time.</p>

               <p>HANNAH MUSBANK sworn. - I was standing at my window, up two pair of stairs, in Vere-street, a little lower down than the public-house, about twenty minutes before one in the morning, I was sitting up for my husband; I saw a man standing at the corner, close to a pork-shop bench, I saw him pull something white from his left side; I pushed up my window gently; I saw him put three or four different parcels, a shirt at a time, and different things underneath the bench; he left them there, and went on, and tried the cellarwindow exactly opposite where I live; he went two doors further, and returned; he walked past the property, and spoke to the watchman; he walked a few doors up towards his lodgings, and then turned back again; I called to the watchman, and told him there was something placed under that bench; I told him that man at the corner had placed them there; he was never out of my sight from the time he put the things down till the watchman laid hold of him, and took him to the watch-house; I had no light myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was that man? - A. I cannot swear to his face, but I am sure it was the same the watchman laid hold of.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know who that man was? - A. No; I was apprehensive they would recommence their attack upon me, and I said, don't use me ill, and I will give you what money I have; I put my hand in my pocket, and took out what money I had and gave them; while I was doing this, the man had got his finger and thumb into my sob, and slipped the watch out; some signal was then given, and away they all ran; when they first came up, there was a kind of whisper amongst them, "has he got one?" by which I suppoted they meant a watch, and the man said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of them were there? - A.There<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180057"/>must have been at least twenty before me, as I stood on the step.</p>
               <p>Q.What sort of a watch was it? - A. A gold watch.</p>
               <p>Q. You were not knocked down? - A. No, I saved myself by holding the rails, they took away my hat and my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know if the prisoner was one of them? - A. No, I cannot speak to his person.</p>

               <p>Q. Supposing a hat should not fit, and it is returned, do you scratch out the name? - A. Yes, before we sell it to any body else.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you sell it? - A. In June last.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him on the 27th of July last? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - A. He knocked at my Lady's door, and the footman went to open the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present at the time? - A. I was informed some body wanted me; I went and found the prisoner; he told me I had injured his character, and that if I would give him all I had, I could not make him amends; I told him, I did not know what he could mean by that, I had never injured his character, and desired he would go about his business; I shut the door, and as soon as I had shut the door, he began knocking violently; the door was not opened, and he went down to the area door, and began knocking there; I went with the footman to the area door, and opened it; he began repeating again, that I had injured his character, and called me a f-e and a b-r, upon that I went for a constable.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him you should go for a constable? - A. I did; I got a constable, and found the prisoner at a public-house over the way; I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the constable, in the presence of the prisoner, the nature of the charge? - A. I do not recollect that I did; we took him to the Justice's, and waited till the Justice fat, at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. You took him before Mr. Conant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not at that time got any money from you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor had he demanded any? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. He was afterwards discharged by Mr. Conant, I believe? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.When did you see the prisoner again? - A. About a minute or two after; I had got home the same night, he knocked at the door again, and repeated the same kind of abuse; I took him again before the Justice, told him he had become troublesome again, and he discharged him again.</p>
               <p>Q. He had not, at that time, demanded any money? - A. He had not; the prisoner then went home with me, and kept threatening me all the way, that I was a f-e and a b-r, and he would proclaim it in the neighbourhood where I lived; he said, he would tear my Lady's house down but he would get at me.</p>
               <p>Q. He kept threatening you in that manner all<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180058"/>the way? - A. Yes; I was very much alarmed and frightened for my reputation, and for fear of losing my situation, in which I was very comfortable, and which I was sure I should, if he made a disturbance; he said, if I would make him a handsome present, he would not trouble me any more; I asked him what he meant; he said, if I would give him four guineas; after some hesitation, I consented to give him four guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you give him the four guineas? - A.Because I was so alarmed and frightened, I thought, in all probability, I should lose my situation if I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was this conversation from your Lady's house? - A. About one hundred yards; I then went home and got a five pound note, and a one pound note; I went to the baker's to get change for the five pound note, and I could only get two one pound notes and a guinea in part; I then returned to him with the two one pound notes, the one I had before, and the guinea which I gave him.</p>
               <p>Q.That was three shillings short of four guineas? - A. Yes; I then went home, and mentioned it to my Lady's brother, and he advised me to prosecute him; I went to Mr. Conant again, and he issued a warrant to apprehend him; I did not know in what part of the town to look for him, and I did not find him till the 9th; I met him in St. Paul's church-yard; he said to me, you owe me three shillings; I took him by the collar, and he struck me several times with his hat; two young men came up to my assistance, and the prisoner was secured and taken before Mr. Conant.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that the prisoner is the man who so conducted himself towards you? - A. I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you ever done any thing yourself to work an injury to this man, in his character, in any way whatever? - A. Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. I hardly need ask you - did you part with this money willingly, or did you do it from fear? - A. From the great apprehension and fear I had of losing my situation in life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. I believe you know the place from whence the prisoner came? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Where is that place? - A.Bury St. Edmunds.</p>
               <p>Q.Besides knowing the place from whence he came - did you not know him personally? - A. I did know him slightly personally.</p>
               <p>Q.When he came, he enquired for you by name? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.And the first complaint he made was, that you had injured his character very much, and that if you were to give him all you had, you could not make him remends? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say where it was you had so injured this character? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately have you been at Norwich? - A. Not these seven years.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not mention any place whatever, where he said you had been spreading reports injurious to his character? - A. He said, some person at Norwich had told him so.</p>
               <p>Q. You denied it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner became in a passion, and used the opprobrious expressions you have mentioned? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not, when he came down the area, repeat his charge, that you had injured his character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any person here who heard what passed, besides youself? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. The charge made by him was utterly false? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.However, he did not believe your denial? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of those expressions, he and you went to Mr. Conant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Did not Mr. Conant tell you to go out and settle it between yourselves? - A. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q.After he came back from Mr. Conant, did he not again repeat upon you the charge of having injured his character? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You still denied it? - A. I certainly did.</p>
               <p>Q. He told you still he did not believe you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.He then repeated those opprobrious expressions, and he again went before Mr. Conant? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.After he came from Mr. Conant the second time, did he not repeat his charge upon you, that you had injured his character? - A. I cannot say whether he did at that time or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not demand this money of you as a recompence for the injury you had done to his character? - A. No, he did not.</p>

               <p>JOHN-WIGHT WICKS sworn. - Q.Were you robbed at any time, and where? - A. Yes, on the 9th of September, between the hours of eight and nine in the evening; I was returning home from Somerset-street, Portman-square; I had a lady with me who had dined at the lame house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. In Aikin's-row, Bayswater.</p>

               <p>Q.What sort of persons were they? - A. One was taller than the other by half a head, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it the taller or the shorter one that did you stop? - A. I think it was the taller one that cried stop, but that I can scarcely tell; the taller one, who immediately saced me, caught hold of my watch-chain and seal; of course momentary resistance took place, by putting my hand against both of them, leaving my companion by herself; during that momentary resistance, the taller one made off, and ran away; still resisting, or rather endeavouring to palliate any thing that might ensue from the shorter one, I was hustled or forced into the road from off the foot-path.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom were you hustled and forced into the road? - A. By the shorster one; when in the road, the man who hustled me did not say any thing, but immediately 
               <persName id="t18020918-122-person826">drew</persName>
             a pistol, which he presented at me, the taller one being in the act of running away, crying, shoot him, d-n him, shoot him, or words to that amount; a coach was just at that moment coming near me; I immediately gave the glarm of thief, very loudly, the person at that time still holding his pistol, making his way, commencing his run, and I followed him down the road.</p>
               <p>Q.During this time, was it sufficiently light to make any observation of the person? - A. It was so light, that I could distinguish the general aspect and appearance of the man who held the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was it? - A.That man. (Pointing to the prisoner.)</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain? - A.Positively certain: I gave the alarm, and followed him immediately; he had commenced his running away, he was not out of my sight till two gentlemen, whom I had passed before, had stopped him; I myself not being three yards behind him, so that in fact he was between two sires; as soon as I had him in my own hand, which could not be half a second, or scarcely a second; I said, you are the man, sir, that offered the pistol at me; the man then offered to exculpate himself; I would not make any answer till we got him to a public-house, where he was taken by myself and the other two gentlemen, in the way to the public-house; the lady being at some little distance, came up, and immediately said, that is the man that stopped us.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is that public-house? - A. At the end of the row where I reside, at the back part of Knesington-Gardens, it is a continuation of the road; when there I put him in custody of two men, who came in under the names of Bow-street patrols; the man most strennously denied the fact; I asserted positively, before every individual there, that I would describe the pistol, it was the object that struck me; when the prisoner denied having any pistol, I pledged myself, that I would mention it in this particular way; it is an old fashioned brown, round handled pistol, and has all the appearance of a muzzle of a bellows; it struck me at the time, when a school-boy, at Eton, I purchased such an one at an iron shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner drop the pistol? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you first described the pistol, it had not been found? - A. It had not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the patrol do with the prisoner? - A. I saw no more of him, till I saw him at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lose any of your property? - A. The prisoner did not get possession of any property, the one who ran away got possession of the watchchain and the seal, breaking it off close to the pendant of the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a chain was it? - A. A common gilt chain, and two seals, the one was a family gold seal, with the arms, they were both gold seals.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180062"/>Q.Have you seen the seals since? - A.I have not.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor chain? - A.Not any part of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe, at the time you took the prisoner, he denied he was the person who held the pistol? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q.The lady who was with you, I believe, appeared alarmed, and he desired her not to be alarmed? - A.Certainly not, I believe she took no sort of notice of him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him throw the pistol away? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Perhaps, you were a little alarmed? - A. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Mrs. ROSE LEONARD sworn. - Q. Were you in company with Mr. Wicks, at the time of this transaction? - A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You were walking home with him? - A. I was.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you meet with any interruption? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You must state what that interruption was? - A. We met two men, one taller than the other; they both ran against Mr. Wicks; the shorter one drove him into the road, and then the taller one went off.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you observed any thing more done before the tall one went off? - A. No; as he was running off, he said, shoot him, d-n him, shoot him.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see any thing taken from Mr. Wicks? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any instrument used by either of them, by which he might shoot him? - A. I did not see the pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you distinguish the persons of either of the men? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner? - A. I know him very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he or not one of the men? - A. He was the one that drove Mr. Wicks into the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any other circumstance that you are enabled to speak to? - A.Nothing more than I picked up a stick in the road, which was dropped by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it? - A. No, but the taller one was never in the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positively sure the prisoner at the bar is the person you have described as the short one? - A. I am very sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the stick you picked up? - A. I delivered it to a person who is here.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys Q. All this violence was addressed to Mr. Wicks, there was none addressed to you? - A. None.</p>

             sworn. - Q. What do you know of this transaction? - A. I was walking with Mr. Sherwin, who had been to my house in Aikin's-row; I observed, when we got to the road, which leads up to Craven-hill, we met two men, one taller than the other; they had sticks in their hands; they ran against us, face to face, as close as could be; I suspected what their intentions were, and put myself in a posture of defence; they passed by, they dared not attack us, we had both of us, sticks; a short time after, we met a gentleman and lady, not above twenty yards from the place where we expected these men to stop us, in a short time after that, I heard a cry of thieves, thieves, stop thief; I immediately turned back, and Mr. Sherwin with me, as hard as we could; I could plainly see the men running away from the gentleman; I came up as quick as I could, one man jumped upon the bank, I saw him jump, and in a moment I seized the other by the breast; the prisoner at the bar immediately said, there he goes, pointing to the one over the hedge, yes, says I, and you shall go too.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing in his hand? - A. I did not, I shook him two or three times, rather in a manner he did not like; he begged for God's sake I would not hurt him, and he would go any where with me; we took him to a public-house; Mr. Wick's was close by, and as soon as the lady saw me bring him up, she said, that is the man; Mr. Wicks desired me to take him to the Blacklion, and take care of him till he came up, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the man that passed you? - A. I am sure of it; I said, you are the man that wanted to stop us, you had not courage, I believe.</p>

             sworn. - Q. Were you at Bayswater on the evening of the 9th? - A. Yes, between the hours of eight and nine; my wife being in the wash-house, heard a great cry out, and called me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live? - A. At a wax-factory, near Craven-hill; I immediately came up, and saw the two last witnesses have the prisoner in hold; I then went with them to the Black-lion, and after he was given into the custody of the patrol, some company borrowed a lantern, and we searched the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might that be after the prisoner was secured? - A. It might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; some not into the turnip-field, and others searched the ditch; I proposed to Mr. Wicks, that the watchman at the factory should call us up as soon as it was light, in the morning; we searched for the space of five or ten minutes, and then found the pistol that I have now in my hand, in the ditch, it was loaded and cocked; Mr. Wicks had described it before I went to search.(Produces a pistol.)</p>
               <p>Q.(To Mr. Wicks.) Look at that pistol, and say whether it is the same? - A.Identically the same; I immediately secured it, and put it upon the sideboard table till I went to the office.</p>

               <p>- CAFFHAM sworn. - I am shopman to Mr. Edward Freers, a pawnbroker in Little Pulteney-street, about ten minutes walk from Fitzroy-square: On Friday, the 2d of July, about nine o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180065"/>shop, I have known him from a little boy, with a pair of table spoons, and tea spoons; he said he wanted to make up his rent; Mrs. Jardine claimed them the same morning: On Saturday, the 17th, the prisoner brought two sheets to pledge, and I sent for a constable, and stopped him; I saw Mr. Jardine's watch taken from his pocket.</p>
               <p>JAMES KENNEDY sworn. - I am an officer belonging to Marlborough-street, I was sent for to take charge of the prisoner; when I took him into custody, he was going to put the seal of his watch in; I said, don't do that, because I must have it; he said it was his own; I took it from him, (produces it), I have had it ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Jardine. I know these to be my spoons, one is stouter than the other, and they are a little rubbed at the back.</p>
               <p>Q.Could you, merely from this circumstance, have been able to swear to them if you had found them any where else? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any mark upon the tea-spoon? - A. No, none; I cannot give any particular description of the watch, but it is familiar to my sight.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I know these spoons well, I have had them more than a twelvemonth; I know the watch perfectly well, the regulator is marked like a star upon the face of it; it is different from any other regulator; the maker's name is Addis.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about its being your watch? - A. None; the seal and key are the same.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Have you subponaed the watchman or officer? - A. No; I had my reasons for not doing it.</p>
               <p>Q. You went to visit a young lady at Stockwell? - A. I went to enquire about some ground that was to be let.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fall in company with any other lady before you got to town? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get into the company of any ladies? - A. I don't know what you mean by company; I met several, if you please to call them ladies, but I call them no better than brutes; I met twenty or thirty of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had any young woman her hands about you in your way to town? - A. No; I don't remember any.</p>
               <p>Q. If such a thing had happened, you must remember it? - A. Yes; I remember two or three stopped me, and said, sir, will you go along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that the girl put her arms about your neck? - A. No one did, that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not one of these brutes, as you call them, kiss you? - A. If she kissed me, I would not kiss her; I would as soon kiss a cow as one of those.</p>
               <p>Q. You read the Scriptures, I know, and must be acquainted that it is a criminal thing to kiss a cow? - A. I would as soon kiss one, as kiss one of those women, for I abhor them.</p>
               <p>Q. So do all men who are fond of kissing cows: so some one of those ladies put her arms about your neck? - A. If she did, it was not by my consent.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180066"/>Q.Had you a sick of the asthma at that time? - A. I don't know when you mean.</p>
               <p>Q.Where were you for three hours and an half; you say you left Stockwell at ten, and was on blackfriars-bridge at one? - A.Sometimes I could not walk it in three days.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you are sometimes three days on your journey from Stockwell to London? - A. No; but I cannot go up three pair of stairs sometimes, and am confined for two months together.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that none of these women spoke to you on the road? - A. They asked me to stop, and go with them, but I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it happen by any accident that your breeches were unbuttoned in the road, and your shirt hanging out? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q.Upon your oath, were not your breeches unbuttoned, and your shirt hanging out? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear it was not? - A. No, not at all; I will take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into any house between Stockwell and London? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was it you did stop? - A. Where I could, sometimes against a post, or where I could rest myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you met the girls first? - A.Soon after I passed the oblick.</p>
               <p>Q.Somewhere near Hughes's? - A. They were scattered up and down all over the road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you had not your breeches down, and that a mob followed you in consequence of it? - A. I will take my solemn oath it was not so.</p>
               <p>Q. You were very drunk? - A. I was not very drunk, I was sensible; I cannot say I had not been drinking, but was not drunk.</p>
               <p>Q.You say you sat down over the middle arch? - A. I say, it was the first arch, about the fifth lamp towards the Surry side; you asked me which side it was, I said, the London; as to my sitting down, I said it was the first arch; the arch I set down on was nearer the Surry side than the London side; it was the first arch, and the fifth lamp, from the Surry side.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where the Albion Milis were? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the first arch on that side? - A. Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. At what watch-house were the men searched? - A. It was by the Circus.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. That is certainly in Surry, but I don't wish to avail myself of any objection.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was next to the Albion Mills? - Yes, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this young man came from the middle of the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he left you, which way did he go? - A. He went to the watch-house with me and the watchman, and the other man with us.</p>
               <p>Q.Did you catch hold of him in the instant? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He came from the middle of the Bridge to where you were sitting down? - A. Yes, I think he did; I am certain he came up to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he came from the middle of the road? - A. Yes, I think so.</p>
               <p>Q.Where was his companion? - A.They were both standing together when he took the watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not charge his companion, he was equally guilty you know? - A. I did not know that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever state this fact before? - A. I don't know, I might.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you swear you did? - A. I told the constable I would not give charge of him, because I had nothing to do with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew, if he was in company, he was equally guilty? - A. I don't know how that may be; I am not acquainted with the Law, for I am more acquainted with the Golpel.</p>
               <p>Q.And I suppose you know the Commandment, which says, thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour? - A. Yes, I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever take either the prisoner or the other in custody at all? - A.Certainly he is the man, though he is not dressed now as he was then.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever take him or other man into custody? - A. I delivered them up to the watchman; I did this man, not both of them, though both went.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said to the prisoner that he had stole your watch, did he not say that it was an impudent charge, and that you must accompany him, and his friend said he would go with him? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say you must go to the watch-house? - A. No; though I was used ill by the watchman and him, and while they were taking him to the watch-house, my pocket was picked of my handkerchief, but I did not lay that to their charge.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did the prisoner say you must go with him to the watch-house, or did he make any charge against you? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to say that neither the prisoner or his friend said, you must go to the watch-house? - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen did you pass on the road before the prisoner was taken into custody? - A.Not one.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say, you gave charge to the first you met? - A. Yes; I called watch, and he came up.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was that from the Bridge? - A.Just a little from the end, not far.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180067"/>Q.Did you not pass a watchman on the Bridge? - A. It was not my first design to prosecute the man; my design was to get my propety, nothing more; I would not prosecute a man if you would give me the Indies; I was ignorant of the nature of it, and was compelled.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you, did you not meet a watchman on the Bridge, before you came to the man who took charge of the prisoner? - A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you your senses about you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.If there was a watchman standing on the Bridge, after the time you lost your watch, must you not have seen him? - A. I don't know, I did not see any.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know there was a watch-box within a yard or two of the place where you were robbed? - A. Yes, I believe there was, but if there was a box, there was no watchman there.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? - A.However, if there was, he was asleep; I called, watch, and the first that came I gave charge to.</p>
               <p>Q. I will ask you, whether, at the moment you charged this man with picking your pocket, you called out, watch? - A.Certainly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. That you mean to swear? - A. I called out, watch, as soon as ever I missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you mean to swear that, at the moment you were robbed, you called out, watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know, whether there is not a watch-box within two or three yards of the place? - A. I don't know any thing of the watch-box, there may be for what I know, but I am not certain; however, if there was a watch-box, there was no watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. How many watchmen did you pass as you went over the bridge? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q.Whereabouts in the road was the prisoner when he was taken into custody? - A.Just by the turnpike; I cannot say positively to the spot; the watchman took him out of my hands.</p>
               <p>Q. His friend accompanied him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And they told you they would take care you should be punished for charging him with a robbery? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Nothing was found on them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.His friend insisted on being searched, did he not? - A. I don't know that he was searched; I did not charge the other with any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not searched? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And nothing found? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q.Neither your pocket-handkerchief or watch? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first charged this young man, he told you where he had been, and that he was returning from the play, did he not? - A. No; a man came to me the next day, and told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not lay so? - A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect he said he would punish you for this? - A. He said, if he was locked up, he would make me suffer for it.</p>
               <p>Q. You deny having been concerned with any girls on the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had your shirt hanging out of your breeches? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You give a negative to that? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you mean to tell me, and those gentlemen, that you were that length of time coming the distance you have stated? - A. I was.(Here the whole of Blackfriars Bridge was proved to be within the City of London.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am innocent of the charge, and leave my case to my Counsel.</p>
               <p>For the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>JOHN KARRENS sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What business are you? - A. A hatter, and worked with the prisoner, at Mr. Vaughan's, near the Borough.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in company with him when he met with the prosecutor? - A. I was, and had hold of his arm; it was on Monday night, the 14th of September, about one o'clock, about the middle of Blackfriars-bridge; we had been to the play, and were going straight home, when the prosecutor took hold of the prisoner by the shoulder, and said, you are the man that took my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prosecutor drunk or sober at that time? - A. He was drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. Had your friend, the prisoner, any opportunity of taking his watch? - A. No, nor did he attempt it; I was surprised at the man making such an assertion, and said, he wanted to quarrel with us; then I desired him to be gone, or I would give him a blow; the prisoner took the prosecutor's hand from his shoulder, and pushed him away, and we passed on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor call out for watch, at the moment he seized the defendant? - A. No; he came up again, upon which I laid my hand on his shoulder, and pushed him off into the middle of the street, seeing he was in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pass any watchman? - A. We walked the usual pace over the Bridge, and passed a watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asleep? - A. I don't think so; I saw him in his box.</p>
               <p>Q. Must the prosecutor have seen him? - A. I think so.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he visible? - A. The box was open.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it? - A.Just at the foot of the Bridge, when we came to turn down John-street, opposite the Leverian Museum, the watchman was standing by his box, and the prosecutor called, watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it there he first spoke to a watchman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he here to-night? - A. I believe so; we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180068"/>stopped, and the watchman took the prisoner into custody; the prisoner told the prosecutor to take care what he was about, in charging him with taking his watch, and gave charge of the prosecutor, upon which we all went to the watch-house, by the Obelisk, I went voluntarily with my friend; the constable asked whether there was any charge against me; the watchman said, there was not; then the prisoner was searched, but nothing found of the prosecutor's, and I was searched at my own desire.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prosecutor was drunk? - A. Yes, very drunk, perceivable to any person.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Thomas). Q. Is that the man who was with the prisoner? - A. Yes, I believe it is; the prisoner came up to me, and he stood at my right hand.</p>
               <p>Karrens. I never saw the man till he took hold of the prisoner by the shoulder.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see a watchman in his box, upon your oath? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Thomas. I did not see the box.</p>

               <p>JAMES MUNYARD sworn. - On the 21st of June, between the hours of one and three, I was standing in <placeName id="t18020918-128-crimeloc682">Cranbourn-alley</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by M. Knapp. Q. You felt his hand in your pocket? - A. Yes, but did not see it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you catch him directly? - A. No; he run round the small mob; it might be a quarter of a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his hat taken off? - A. Yes, and the book taken out.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am a foreigner, and very innocent of this business; I was going through Cranbourn-alley, where I saw a mob, so that I could hardly pass; I saw the prosecutor in conversation with a man in a blue coat, whom he left, and immediately came up to me, saying, you have got my pocket-book; I produced my own red book, he said, no, that was not his; then my hat was knocked off, and a man said, here is your pocketbook, then he let me go; I was walking on, when he came after me, and said, I will stop you; I told him I would go with him any where, which I did; I am quite innocent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. (To Munyard.) Q. Is it true, he offered to go to Bow-street, or any where, with you? - A. No, he ran away, and I took him again; he said, he was very sorry for it, as it was his first offence; he made resistance for a long time, till he found the people on my side.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character. <rs id="t18020918-128-verdict683" type="verdictDescription">

I am in his Majesty's service; I went to that man's house, and was rather groggy; he forced me up stairs, and threw me on a bed, and locked the door on me; I remained there, till about four o'clock, when I got up, and wanted to get out, but could not; I knocked and called, but no answer; I did not know where I was, and as I could not get out, I took the sheet and blankets, knotted them together and got down, but did not take any thing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dixon. There were two sheets and two blankets he had left hanging at the window; he was a little in liquor. <rs id="t18020918-130-verdict695" type="verdictDescription">

               <p>ROBERT BARNETT sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. What business are you? - A. I am an apothecary and man-midwife, at Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Q.State what you know relating to that unfortunate woman? - A. On Tuesday the 24th of August, I saw a female infant, which I examined, to ascertain whether it was born dead or alive, and I gave my opinion on oath, before the Coroner, that it was born alive, and not above ten or twelve hours before, and been in the water about five hours; on Thursday the 26th, by the desire of the overfeers, I went to the house of the prisoner, who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180071"/>was in the room with her mother and little sister; I said, it was supposed that one of them had been delivered of a child, and asked where the child was; the mother said, it was no such thing, of something of that kind; upon which I asked her to let me examine her daughter, to convince the public whether it was so or not; her mother desired her to go up stairs with me, which she did, but resused to let me examine her; however, after some time, I did, and had every reason to think she had been delivered of a child, but as to saying to a day or so, it is out of my power, but that she had been recently delivered; I asked her where the child was; they made no answer, but the mother said, the prisoner had miscarried, about a week before, of a boy, but afterwards she said she did not know what it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The child found, was a female child? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear positively that the child you examined was born alive? - A. No, I do not, but to the best of my knowledge it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to be understood, that you have always said you believed the child was born alive? - A. Yes, I do, it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you always said so, clear as you are now? - A. I don't know any thing to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did you not before the Magistrate entertain a doubt whether the child was born alive or not? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never entertained any doubt? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. It is my duty to warn you a little of what you have said; you there said it was im-possible for you to say it was born alive? - A.I was asked whether, by opening the body, I could, or not, then say, it was born alive; I said, if it was opened, and I had the things of the child, and they floated; I said, that even from that, no gentleman of the faculty could swear it was born alive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Do you mean to say now, po sitively, that you believe it was born alive? - A.I have every reason to believe it was; the question put to me before the Magistrate was, whether I could not swear positively; I said, no, it was out of the power of any gentleman to swear it; a child coming into the would may fetch a gasp that will expand the lungs equally the same as though it lived twelve hours, with regard to the apprearance of the child, it appeared not to have been born above ten or twelve hours.</p>
               <p>Q. From the appearance of the woman, are you enabled to form any opinion whether the had been delivered more than that time, or about that time? - A. No; I can form no opinion of that.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. I want to know what it is you do mean; when I read your deposition before the Alderman, I was led to suppose that it amounted to your idea, and to the best of your opinion; I understand you will not now swear it as a positive fact? - A. I cannot swear it as a positive fact, though I believe it.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Where do you live? - A. In Nightingale-lane, Limehouse, and am one of the bearers of the parish: I picked up a female insant, vwhich I found in the River Thames after the tide had left it, and when I washed it, there appeared to be a blow on the right side of its head.</p>
               <p>JANE STEVENSON sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You are a widow, I believe? - A. Yes, and live at No. 16, John-court, Limehouse, next door to the prisoner; between the houses there is only a lath and plaster partition, so that I can hear every word that passes: On the Saturday morning before the child was found, I went into the prisoner's to light my candle, and saw her in the apparent agony of labour, and very sick; I was sure she was pregnant, and expected it every day, and so did all the neighbours.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her again? - A. In the morning, in very strong labour.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see her next? - A. Not till she got better, on the Monday morning; she was sitting at the door with her brother's child in her arms; she sat all of a heap, so that I could well observe whether she was delivered, but I thought she had been; before I saw the child's body, I asked her to go with me, and see it; she said she would; I asked her again soon after, then she said her shoes were gone to be mended, and she could not go; I asked her mother to go, and she said she could not bear to see it.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You are quite sure the was in the pains of labour on the a Saturday? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw her on Monday, she had been in labour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have no doubt but she was delivered on Saturday? - A. None at all.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q.Where do you live? - A. I keep the house next door to the prisoner: On the Saturday night before the Tuesday on which the child was found, I went to-bed, and about half past four, I was awaked by a noise, which I thought was the noise of a young child; it was noon over, and presently I thought I heard something like a cackling, I thought it was the pigs, and went to sleep again; I did not see the prisoner till the Tuesday, when she seemed very low, and was washing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. This noise, which you first thought was a child, was on Saturday night? - A. Yes; but I don't know when the was brought to-bed.</p>
               <p>- DALTON sworn. - I am a constable, and took the prisoner into custody; I asked her if she<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="180209180072"/>had been guilty of it, she told me, when her mother came forward, she would tell the whole truth; I went back for her mother, but she had absconded; I told the prisoner, and she said, if I would hear her, she would confess; she said; she had a child that she was brought to bed with as she stood by the bed-side, on Saturday before the Tuesday when the child was found; that she put the child on one side, and after that she went and put it in the ditch at high water, where the tide flows in, but if her mother was found, she could tell better about it; I searched for her, and at last I found her locked up in a room in Catharine-wheel-alley, Whitechapel; the prisoner afterwards said that she threw it over the furthest bridge from her house, and that her mother had nothing to do with it; I asked her whether the child was alive or not; she said she could not tell, for she had a dimness come over her eyes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Did she not say it was a male child? - A. She said it was, in the first instance, but afterwards she said she could not tell.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say any thing respecting this matter? - A. I heard her tell Mr. Dalton she had been brought to-bed between six and seven o'clock on Saturday night; she did not say whether the child was alive or dead, or male or female.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you not hear her say whether the child was alive or dead? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It is extraordinary you should hear her say first, that she was delivered of a dead-born child, for you have sworn that once before the Alderman? - A. I did not hear her say so, for I am rather deaf.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what you said taken down in writing? - A. I don't know; I was not there when it was taken down.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not read over to you? - A. I did not hear any.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not sign it? - A. I put a cross to something.</p>
               <p>Q. You there said you heard her declare she had been delivered by the bed-side of a dead-born child? - A. No; I did not say any thing about it; I never heard her say any thing about dead-born, or live-born.</p>

             sworn. - I keep a cloathscellar, in Monmouth-street; I bought the handkerchief of the prisoner, who was a stranger to me: On the 5th of this month, between five and six o'clock in the evening, she came to my cellar, with two phials in her hand, and asked me if I would buy an old shirt, for that her husband was just come out of the hospital, that his thigh was broke in two places, and she was forely distressed, and had no other means of buying stuff for him; she said, she was also very ill with the complaint that was going about, and that it would be a charity to buy it out of compassion more than any thing; I agreed to give her two shillings for the shirt and handkerchief; the handkerchief, she said, was of no value; I got change, and paid her in the street; next day, the prosecutor's wife came and asked me the price of a new shirt; I told her, I had a dirty one down stairs, if she would look at it, it might answer her purpose as well; she came down stairs, and after looking at them, said, if they both belonged to me, she would bring her husband and buy them; accordingly, by and by her husband came, with another man; he seemed to own the shirt, but did not tell me directly; he seemed all of a slurry; at last, he told me it was his; I said, it he would lend for a constable, I would deliver it up; I described the woman to him, and he knew her to live in the house with him; I gave the shirt to the constable, and went and shewed him the thief.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure the shirt and handkerchief you gave up, are the same you received from the prisoner? - A. The very same, and I am sure I had them of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was fastened the night before? - A. Yes; I knocked up the people at the landing-place opposite, and while I was dressing myself, the prisoner came up stairs, and said, good God, where is my hat; he had this hat on his head, which is mine, (produces it;) he had not his own hat; I asked him what he had done with my things; he said, don't say any thing, and you shall have them by the time you have done break fast; he asked me to give him some halfpence to buy some geneva with; I told him he had taken all the halfpence out of my breeches, and that I had not got any; he said, my things were left at a night-house, near the top of the Hay-marker; he asked me if I had received a note from him, I said, no; the next morning I went to his lodgings, with an officer, he said, I should have my things, if I would make it up; I said, I would not; we found a half-handkerchief in his room, which is mine.</p>

             sworn. - I am servant to Messrs. Day, carmen: I took a puncheon of brandy from Summer's-quay, to Mr. Peters's, at Holborn-hill; he kept a liquor-shop there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner? - A. I met him on that day; I cannot say what day it was; he met me in St. Paul's Church-yard, when I had a load in my cart; he had worked for my master about two years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he at all employed by them at this time? - A. No; he followed me to about the middle of Ludgate-hill, and there I missed of him; after I had put the puncheon ready to rack the liquor out, at Mr. Peters's, I saw the prisoner inside the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time desire him to go, and receive the cartage for you or your master? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know of his going at any time? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that bit of paper, and see if that is your writing, or if it was written with your knowledge? - A. I wish I could write as well, it would be of great service to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know of its being written? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the cartage of this would have been? - A. I believe, three shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>ALICE HORDEN sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I was servant to Mr. James Peters, of Holborn-hill, on the 19th of June.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect a cask of brandy being brought to your master's house by Mr. Day's cart on that day? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. Yes; he was at our house that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Peters alive now? - A. He is dead since; he has been dead about a fortnight; the brandy was drawn off at the door in cans; the prisoner chalked down the number of cans that came in; about three days after he came again, and brought the bill to receive the money for the cartage of the brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill that he brought to you? - A. Yes, this is the bill; he said he came to receive the money for the cartage of the puncheon of brandy; he said he came from Mr. Day's; Mr. Peters was out; I said I did not know whether I was to pay him or not; he said, it was all the same, as if Mr. Day came himself; in consequence of his saying that, I paid him the amount of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you belive that he came from Mr. Day? - A. Yes; about a week, or a fortnight after, Mr. Day called himself, and we found it was paid to the wrong person. (The bill of parcels read.)</p>
               <p>Q. Who signed that receipt? - A. The prisoner.</p>

             sworn. - I am a copyist at Covent-garden Theatre: On Monday, the 30th of August, between six and seven o'clock, going up King-street from Holborn towards the fields, I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw the prisoner, Wellings, running towards me, on the opposite side of the way; he called out in a tremulous, plaintive voice, do not, it is nothing; I stopped him, a young man came up, and he gave me a violent blow; while I had hold of him, Danby came down the street, and ran against us both; he had his arm round Wellings; I did not know then what was the matter, till I heard some person say there is another of the thieves; Danby then ran up the street, and in about a minute or two he was brought back again; at that instant somebody said, there is your handkerchief, sir; upon which Mr. Sedgwick stooped, and picked it up close to the prisoners; Danby fell down upon his knees, and begged for mercy, and they were taken to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Danby's defence. I was going up King-street; I heard a cry of stop thief; a great many people were running, and I ran with the crowd, and was taken in the pursuit.</p>

               <p>Wellings's defence. I was going up King-street; I heard the alarm of stop thief; I ran when I got within two yards of Holborn; Mr. Sedgwick laid hold of me, I am quite innocent of the crime.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, Danby, called his father, who gave him a good character for honesty, but said, he had got into loose company lately.</p>

             sworn. - On Wednesday, the 20th of August, between five and six in the evening, I saw the prisoner drag the bundle from the prosecutor, at Mr. Jones's wine-vaults, the bottom of Hedge-lane; I asked him if it was her bundle or his; he told me it was his; and while he was putting up the money, I ran after her, and did not find her till I got into Castle-street, and there I found her, with the bundle open in the street, with two women; I supposed she was selling them to the two women; I took the things from her, and brought her back; a young man helped me to take her back to the prosecutor, and from there she was taken to Bow-street, and delivered to the constable.</p>
               <p>JOHN M'GREGOR sworn. - On the 25th of August, between five and six o'clock, I heard an alarm of stop thief; I took the prisoner into custody, with the bundle; I received the bundle from the last witness, tied up.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Price). I understood you that you took the bundle from the prisoner, and delivered it to to this man? - Q. Yes, I had the bundle till we got to the public-house, in Bedfordbury, and there I put it upon the table, and delivered it to the constable, at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>M'Gregor. To the best of my knowledge, the prisoner at the bar had the bundle in her custody; I took her to a public-house, in Bedfordbury, and there I delivered her to the constable.</p>

               <p>Simons. I know this is my watch; I had 1l watches hanging up, the other 10 had chains, this was the only one that I had with a string and key to it, just as it came from the watchmaker's; there is no number upon it, but there is a name.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the name? - A. I don't know, I cannot read or write, but all my watches have the same maker's mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know the maker's name? - A.After.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he put his own name upon his watches - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. There were only four watches that had chains, all the rest had strings; I did not go into that shop to tell the watch, only to pawn it, and the pawnbroker would not take it in pledge, he would buy it.</p>
               <p>Q.(To Simons.) What is the value of that watch? - A. I would take 2l. 5s. for it.</p>
