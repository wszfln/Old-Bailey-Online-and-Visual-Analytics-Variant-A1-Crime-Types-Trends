I held it open before him, for him to see if it was his hand-writing - nobody else was in that office. He desired me to turn it to look at the endorsement, which I did. He asked me to turn it again, I did so, and while I was holding it, he made a snatch at it, took it from me, and immediately ran into the clerk's office, I followed him as quick as possible.

             took up the tongs and struck at me with them to prevent my getting at the fire. The bill was quite consumed, he put a cinder over it - I then indicted them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you mean to say you carry on business as a builder now - A. When I have business in hand - I built last Summer. I live in the hamlet of Ratcliff. Crawley is now dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act before you got the bill from him - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he in prison before that - A. I do not know; I never saw him five times in my life - I did not know he was a prisoner, I knew he was an uncertificated bankrupt.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you to take the bill by way of discount, or for goods - A. I had discounted it.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went to inquire if the acceptance was genuine - A. No; I had been to Marsh's, the banker, in Berner-street, where it was made payable, to inquire - they said Mr.

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Were you building at that time - A. I was not, but I was under engagements to build.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper - A. No, I lodge with my father-in-law, who belongs to the Excise - I keep no banker. I gave 71 l. in cash and some odd shillings for the bill, and a promissory note on

               <p>Q. When he brought you the notice, did you not refuse to take it, and say you would not receive any notice of trial - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not turn him out of the room, and refuse to receive any notice, and he was obliged to put it under the door - A. No, I did not turn him out - he put it under the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not been in the room - A. Yes, and said he came to serve me with notice of trial.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Then he was put out - A. No, my Lord, he went down to call a person up, and I shut the door upon him. The notice was at last put under the door.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. With an order stating that it was served by order of the King's Bench - A. No, there was no order. The prisoners have surrendered to-day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know they have sought after you before the last Session, to serve you with notice of trial - A. I heard so.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know they endeavoured to find you out, to serve you with notice of trial last Session - A. I have since heard they did, but I understood they could not give me notice last Session, and I knew Crawley was ill and could not come, and I did not want to trouble them to take them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go with an officer to the house - A. I did, as they told my attorney a falsehood, that they had surrendered. I went before a Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the prisoners summoned before the Magistrate to answer your complaint - A. No, I applied to Mr. Birnie, he told me to apply at Marlborough-street, which I did, and was told the Grand Jury would soon sit, and it would be a pity to trouble them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever taken the benefit of the Insolvent Act yourself - A. I have, between two and three years ago - it is two years and two or three months ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you pay - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you paid any thing - A. I do not know; I had nothing to give up. This 71 l. was my own money.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not pay your creditors - A. It was lent me by my father; I considered it as mine when he lent it me.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not these gentlemen tell you they had been swindled out of this bill and 2000 l. by Crawley, and from your manner they considered you as a coadjutor, and would not give it up, but would give you a copy - A. They did not; they said the bill was got from their hands by some unfair way.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not one of the defendants offer you a copy of the bill - A. No, neither of them, nor any thing like it.</p>
               <p>Q. You said one of them took a paper in his hand; was it not to make a copy of the bill - A. He appeared as if he was about to copy it.</p>
               <p>Q. That there may be no misunderstanding, were you not told you should have a copy of the bill at that time - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not told that if you had advanced any money on the bill, it should be paid you - A. I was not, moreover, I desired Mr. Thomas to call upon Bull next day, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of the clerks did you first see - 
               <persName id="t18191201-1-person80">A. John Gomm</persName>
            ; the other clerk assisted in holding me after the bill was taken. The clerks did nothing till after the bill was taken - no other person was present whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you included them all in the indictment, that they might have no witnesses - No answer.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went with the bill, did you not refuse to give your name - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say that you had the bill from Mr. Joll, instead of saying that you was Joll yourself - A. No, I did not; they asked who Joll was.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to ask you who he was - A. I never heard them say so - I I did not say I was Joll at first.</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to ask - A. They know best - I had not mentioned the name to them before. They asked where Joll lived? I said in the Hamlet of Ratcliffe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say Joll was the person from whom you had it - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray have you ever paid a single sixpence to your creditors since you was discharged - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. For debts due antecedant to your taking the benefit of the Act - A. I allow some in the way of business. I have done work for part of the old debts.</p>
               <p>Q. I see by your schedule, that you gave 300 l. as the amount of debts against you, and state that you had 8 l. 15 s., the greatest part of which was spent in prison - A. You can tell better than I can. My father was a creditor for rent.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you have the 71 l. from - A. From my father - I have been a builder several years, both at Plymouth and London.</p>
               <p>Q. You style yourself a ship-carpenter, joiner, and undertaker - A. I am so.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not then describe yourself as a builder - A. I did not then - I built houses then. A carpenter is a builder.</p>
               <p>Q. Before I sit down I will repeat my question. On the solemn oath you have taken, did not one or either of the defendants tell you that you should have a copy of the bill - A. They did not in any way whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not told that if you had advanced money on it, the sum you advanced should be given to you - A. I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect going afterwards to arrest these gentlemen - A. To take them into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not then say to them, that if they would give you a sum of money, you would not prosecute them - A. I did not, but

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010005"/>Q. How came you not to try the case last Session - A. On account of the illness of Crawley, as I thought he would be a material witness; he was not at Bulls'.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what day you went before the Grand Jury - A. On the Friday-week following. The 21st was Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went before the Grand Jury in November, quite at the end of the Session - A. Quite at the end of the Session. I went out of town on the Tuesday morning following.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you went out of town, had you heard that the prisoners were desirous of having this tried - A. I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the clerks know Frederick Bull had got the bill before they interfered - A. They saw the transaction - they did not see him take the bill, because they were in the other office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they know he had got it - A. They must have seen it. I and Frederick were struggling - Henry assisted him; he laid hold of me a few minutes before George and Gomm did. It was a very few minutes altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you again, had either George or Gomm an opportunity of seeing the bill after you came into the back office - A. They certainly had an opportunity, but whether they saw it or not, I cannot say. I lived in Dunstan's-place at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no jobs in hand then - A. I had not. I had had very little to do for two months before. I have a wife and child, whom I was maintaining at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you last at work - A. In Lucas-street, building two houses; I continued building them up to within about four months of this time. I built them for Mr. Vince. I was paid for them at different times, a considerable time before the 21st of of October.</p>

             was also going out, he made use of the expression of the polluted source from whence the bill was obtained. He said that it came from a polluted source, and that Mr. Joll must have known that it came from a polluted source - from the jaws of the Fleet Prison. I told him he must trace the pollution back to himself, as it was him that gave credit to the bill by his signature - he made no reply.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. When was the 71 l. advanced to Crawley - A. On the 2d or 3d of September, in my office - Crawley was present.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he there? He was a prisoner in the Fleet at that time, was he not - A. No, I knew him; I knew he was an uncertificated bankrupt. I did not know him to be in goal at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where had you seen him before the money was advanced - A. At my office on business; he was a defendant in several actions - he was a client of mine. The bill was drawn by him, and made payable to his order.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted that you would know his handwriting - A. No, I never saw him write. I never saw his signature.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after this money was advanced, was Crawley arrested, and taken to prison - A. About ten days after. I introduced him to Joll.</p>
               <p>Q. Joll being your brother-in-law, you knew perfectly well at all times where he lived - A. He was frequently out of the way because his circumstances were embarrased.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he embarrased in October, at the time this bill was found - A. He was in August and September, but not in October - he was not out of the way, to avoid his creditors, when this indictment was preferred. I knew mostly where to find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember inquiry being made after him for the purpose of serving him with notice of trial in October - A. I do. I did not know where he was then. When he was at home he lived where I do. He did not come home sometimes for a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go to Chatham about that time - A. I believe he did; he told me he was going to purchase some bricks; it was the morning of the day Mr. Harmer's clerk called on me. I told him he might safely go, as I intended to move the Court to put the trial off on account of Crawley's illness. I did not know what part of Chatham he was gone to.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell Mr. Harmer's clerk he was gone to Chatham - A. I told him he was gone into Kent, and mentioned several places. Chatham was one that I mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. These gentlemen attended last Session to surrender and take their trials - A. They did; I believe the Session lasted a week after that.

                  Frederick

            , I went and found him in great agitation. He introduced me to the prosecutor, who was there - it was towards the latter end of October. He said the prosecutor was the person who held a bill of Crawley's, and had brought some constables to take him into custody. He said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake lend me a check, will you?" for I had rather give 500 l. than be conveyed to Newgate - they are going to take me to Newgate." I said I should do no such thing, and asked him if he would compound felony with a set of villains?</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you mean - A. Crawley in particular - I knew him to be an infamous character; I meant him and Joll - Mr. Joll seemed offended, and said,</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" I said I was sure the Grand Jury would not have found the bill if he had not perjured himself. Bull was still agitated, and said he would do any thing rather than be dragged to Newgate. I said,</p>
               <p>"Nonsense! they can't drag you to Newgate." I then said to Joll,</p>
               <p>"Pray, Mr. Joll, what consideration have you given for the bill? because you were told before, if you had given a fair consideration for the bill Mr. Bull would have paid you the amount." His answer was, that he had given the money for the bill, and all he wanted was his right. I said,</p>
               <p>"Pray what is the amount you gave for the bill?" he said,</p>
               <p>"71 l." I said,</p>
               <p>"Did you pay it in Bank notes?" he said,</p>
               <p>"Part in Bank notes, and part in other money." I said,</p>
               <p>"What became of the 29 l. remaining?" he said that was for premium. I then said it was a strange business, and I was certain that rascal, Crawley, was at the bottom of it, and said,</p>
               <p>"You have seen Crawley lately, have you not?" he rather hesitated, and said he had not seen him. I said,</p>
               <p>"You have written to him" - he said, Yes, he had. I asked him what was the purport of the note? he said, to ask respecting Messrs. Bull, and he had received an answer that they were very respectable. During this time the passage door opened, the officer was inside; I called him, and said I wanted to see the warrant. He shuffled and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got the warrant here, but I don't know who the prisoner is." I asked to see the warrant; he said something about arranging - he did not pull the warrant out. At last he produced a paper, which was signed D. Williams, of the Thames Police Office, to take the prisoners into custody. I said,</p>
               <p>"Then, Bull, all you have got to do is to go to prison, and meet it like a man." His mother came in; he said,</p>
               <p>"Mother, do pay the money for me!" she said he had been robbed enough by the whole gang, and would not. The officer said they must go before a Magistrate first. We were going to the Magistrate's, Bull went up to fetch something down - the officer stood at the door - Bull went out, and I did not see him again. The officer said,</p>
               <p>"We shall find him." I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you will find him - all you want is to extort money." They went away without taking him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You stated to Joll, that at the time of taking the bill, Bull had offered to pay him what he advanced on it - A. Yes; he did not deny its having passed. The prisoners are my brothers-in-law, Crawley has made them a dupe. I have had dealings with Crawley at times.</p>

Mayor alarmed me, and I got up, found the folding doors a little way open, and the cellar-window wide open; the doors are fastened by a bolt, and in one of the doors there is a little wicket; they must have turned the button of that wicket, then put their hands in, and opened the bolts. I found that I had lost nine gallons of brandy and six gallons of rum, worth about 13 l. or 14 l. together, also a cask out of the yard. They could get the cask without coming through the tap, but they must have got over the gates.</p>

            . I am a patrol. In consequence of information I accompanied Forrest to this place, about seven o'clock in the morning, and found all the prisoners in the stone kitchen - I knew them before, and told them I wanted them about some brandy, which had been lost from the Swan, in Sloane-street; they said they knew nothing about it. I asked them if any thing was under the bed? They said No. I turned it up, and found the cask which I had seen in the prosecutor's yard before, and said</p>
               <p>"This is the cask - where is the liquor?" They said they knew nothing of it, I took them to the watch-house, returned to the room, and found an iron crow near the fireplace, almost under the grate. I sounded the stones of the floor, and found a large one, about two feet wide, which sounded very hollow. I pulled it up, and found under a sack, three stone bottles full of brandy, and a pail with a little jug in it, which also had brandy. I found about five gallons of brandy in all - there was a little in the cask.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MILES. Q. Do you not know that my father uses the crow in his business - A. I know his father; he is a stone mason, but they do not use such crows as this; it is too large.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Hughes, who lives in Queen's-buildings, Knightsbridge, about fourteen doors from Sloane-street. On a Saturday morning, about six o'clock, three men passed my mistress's house; two were dressed in light jackets, and one in a brown coat. They went towards the prosecutor's, and as they passed me they whispered, which made me suspect them; I followed them past my mistress's shop door, they had nothing with them at that time, and then returned. They came back in about ten minutes, and the man in a brown coat had a cask on his shoulder; the other two said,</p>
               <p>"Come down here." They then went down a court - they were the same men that passed me before. The cask was the size of that produced.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you see the prisoners in custody - A. On the Tuesday following; their dress and size corresponded with the men I saw. I did not see their faces - it was a very dark morning; I had given information to Snowsell.</p>
               <p>(Cask produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MILES'S Defence. On Saturday morning, about ten minutes after six o'clock, I was going to Covent-garden to buy apples, and saw the cask laying down at Knights-bridge. I and this young man went over, and took it to his lodgings; it was half full of brandy. I kept it three days, then borrowed two bottles, emptied it and put it under the stones for safety. The other prisoner happened to be in our room when we were taken.</p>
               <p>PHILLIPS'S Defence. I have nothing more to say - we two were together.</p>
               <p>TOWN'S Defence. I went to call them up, and laid down on the bed until they were ready; Snowsell said I was not wanted. I carried the barrel to the watch-house, and they took me.</p>

On Sunday, the 14th of November, about one o'clock at noon, I saw the prisoner, Moore, in New-street, Borough, with something under his arm, wrapped in a green baize; I suspected and pursued him - he saw me and ran away; I did not call to him as I was ill. He was walking quietly along when I first saw him. He met three more, who nodded to him, to inform him I was coming. He walked to the corner, and then ran. I saw him go in at a door down the yard of a livery-stable, by the Obelisk turnpike gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any houses there - A. There is a house, and some rooms which are occupied as a coffee-shop - I did not see which he went into - the yard is no thoroughfare. I went into the house, then went into a bed-room on the opposite side of the yard, up one pair of stairs, and found two pieces of cloth and the green baize lying by the side of the bed. I do not know who the room belonged to.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you find the prisoner - A. Not there; I searched the house all over. The green baize was like that I saw him with, and about the same size.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did it remain there - A. A very short time - I took it up to a bed-room across the yard, up one pair of stairs, and laid it on the bed - I did not see what it contained.</p>
               <p>Q. From the bulk and weight, might it have contained these things - A. I thought it was bigger than them; it was large enough to hold them.

On a Monday morning, early in October (I do not know the date), I met him going to the warehouse; some conversation passed. He said he had broken a blood-vessel, and had been into Buckinghamshire for his health, and that he had had a horse made him a present of, which he sold for 40 l.; he produced two 40 l. notes, shewed them to me, and said he meant to buy stock in the 3 per Cents.

             and Company, my family reside at Sydenham; Fielder was my footman; he was in the habit of paying money for me, and rendering an account.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From any thing you saw before this, have you any recollection of his hand-writing - A. Only from what I have seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a belief whose hand-writing this draft is - A. I have a faint belief. When I first saw the draft I said,</p>
               <p>"I think this is (Fielder) my footman's hand-writing;" but I never saw him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you paid accounts which he presented to you - A. I have paid small accounts, such as turnpikes, and other small things. He left me on the 22d of October; my family were at Sydenham then. He asked my leave on Monday to go to town on Tuesday, the 19th, and to stay till Wednesday, which I gave him; he returned on Wednesday night. On the Thursday morning, after I left home, he left my service without saying a word.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. You have a very faint impression of its being his hand-writing - A. Yes. He was with me on the 20th, at night; I do not know what time he went on the 19th. He lived four months with me. I had every reason to think him a good character.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND having no further proof of the handwriting, declined proceeding further.</p>

            . On the 16th of November, a little before eleven o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner with the coat in Church-street, Hackney, about a quarter of a mile from the prosecutors', he had it rolled up under his arm. I suspected him, followed him, and said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got?" he said it was a coat, which he had brought from a clergyman's, who was a lodger at a gentleman's house, at Clapton, and was going to take it to his master, who was a tailor, and lived in Whitechapel, to get it cut shorter in the back. I told him to go back with me, and shew where he took it from; he refused, and said he would take me to where he was going - I took him to the watch-house. When he got half-way he said he would go no further. I pulled him on, he then said,</p>
               <p>"I did not bring it from where I told you, I found it in the church-yard." I asked him why he told me that? he said he thought I should not detain him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. Did the prosecutor tell you his name - A. Yes, I have heard him answer to it since the prisoner was taken. The prisoner said he took it from a clergyman, and mentioned some name.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming across Hackney church-yard, and saw the coat lying between two tombstones, I picked it up, and put it under my arm, and the officer stopped me. I told him where I found it, and offered to shew him the place - the lamplighter saw me pick it up. I did not say I brought it from any house.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Snow Hill. On Saturday, the 12th of November, the prisoner offered me this watch in pledge for 50 s. I said I could not lend so much, but observed to him that it was a very good watch; he offered to sell it to me, but I declined buying it, and asked him what he gave for it? He said 40 s. I said I was surprised at his buying it so cheap, and asked him if he knew the value of it? He said No, went away, and pledged it Page's, in Liquorpond-street. The printed bill came in soon afterwards, and I recollected the prisoner having it. He afterwards brought the watch to me again; Page's duplicate was on it then. I told him I believed it to be a stolen one, stopped it, and asked him if he knew of whom he bought it? He said Yes, and as he was watchman of our parish, I let him go to look for the person. He never returned.</p>

            . I am a machine sawyer. On the 19th of November I was coming to town, and passing up the Old Bailey I saw a waggon, partly unloaded, a few yards from the gateway of the New Inn. I saw the prisoner close to me, thought he had no business to be standing there, and passed on about thirty or forty yards, then stopped a few minutes, and saw him put his feet on the wheel, remove some straw, and take this bundle or package out; he immediately left the waggon, Before he had well got his foot on the pavement (four or five persons were passing at the time) he walked in the middle of them till he got opposite Fleet-lane, where he went down. I gave an alarm at the New Inn, and told them that the waggon had been robbed. I took the porters down Fleet-lane, and in the first turning to the right, which is Seacoal-lane, I pointed the prisoner out to them; they secured him, took him back to the Old Bailey, and from there to the Compter. I am sure he is the man.</p>

               <p>"Run on! Run on!" I called out,</p>
               <p>"Stop thief! for he has robbed me of my watch;" he was seized, and I asked him for my watch? as I thought that was also gone, but he said he had not got it. I then asked him for my seals? but he said he had not got them. He was taken to the office; my property was not found.

When he came out he paid me for it; the shopwoman ran in to see if the spoon was there, and said it was gone.

            . I am servant to the last witness; the prisoner came into the shop, and had a bason of soup. About ten minutes after that he asked for trust; I went into the back parlour, and asked Mrs. Anderton to trust him, as he said he knew her. She went into the soup-room, said she did not know him, and waited till he came out of the room; he then said he had found 1 s. to pay for it. As I came out of the parlour I saw him take the tablespoon, and immediately told Mrs. Anderton, who ran after him, and asked him for it. He gave it to her, and Plaistowe took him.</p>

I asked him what he was going to do with the things? He said he was going to sell them. I told him he had better keep them, but he said he should do as he liked with his own property. I said by the appearance of the clothes they did not suit his person, for they belonged to a shorter man, and the waistcoat belonged to some livery servant - he said they were his own. I turned, and saw there was a Jewess in the taproom, with a pair of velveteen breeches in her hand, which Jones said he had given to her. I searched the prisoner, and found nothing on him but a snuff-box in his hat, representing a double-barrelled pistol. I took him to the Bull and Mouth, Inn, where these things were claimed.</p>

            . The prosecutor lodges with me. On the 2d of November, about eleven o'clock in the morning, he came home, brought the prisoner with him, and went into his apartment. He had not been there five or six minutes, before the prisoner came down, and said,</p>

I said I rather thought it was opposite the Castle and Falcon, tavern, in Aldersgate-street. I knew of whom they had it, but I found he had had enough, as he staggered and fell against the wainscot of the passage. He went out for the beer, came back with some a few minutes after, and went up stairs. He came down again in five or six minutes with a bundle in his left hand, and a pair of boots in his right hand, which I had seen Smith wearing a a few days before - I let him go away. About an hour after a person came from the officer, and asked for the prosecutor. I went up, and found him laying on the bed fast asleep - he was drunk. He missed his things.</p>

               <p>"Hold him fast;" which I did, and said,</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, stand round me, or the thief will be rescued." Some respectable persons were nearer to me than the gang - they were hustled with me. I found it was the prisoner's hand, they laid hold of him. A gentleman who had hold of him, said his hand was full of paper; he found my 16 l. in his hand, and the gentleman handed it over to me. I never let his hand go until I collared him. There were one 10 l. and six 1 l. notes. I produce them, and know them to be mine.</p>

            . I am a carrier in the service of Mr. Chad. I go round Norwood and Southall to collect parcels. Last Tuesday week, at night, I received a box from the prisoner, he told me to tell my master to leave it as soon as he got into town - there was a direction on it - I cannot read; it was corded up. I took it home, and afterwards saw it in my master's possession, it was then open. It was about a foot and a half long, and one foot wide - it was heavy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you recollect that you had orders from the prisoner to take it to Mr. Bevan's - A. No. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010014"/>know Mr. Bevan, he is a relation of the prosecutor, and lives in Oxford-street. I delivered the box to my master; I did not see it opened, I saw it when it was open. I never carried a parcel for the prisoner to Mr. Bevan.</p>

            . I am a carrier from Hanwell and Norwood. Butler delivered me a box, which I produce. I took it in doors and opened it, having some suspicion - it was nailed with three nails; it contained a marrow-spoon, twelve silver forks, and a variety of silver articles, also a shirt and four stockings. I took nothing out of it excepting some broken victuals - it contains every thing that was then in it but the victuals; it was directed to Mrs. Connor, No. 13, Gray-street, Manchester-square, London. I came to town immediately, and informed Mr. Bevan. The prisoner was apprehended. I am sure it is the same box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your curiosity induced you to open it - A. Yes. A shoemaker, and another person, who are my next-door neighbours, were present when I opened it. It was about eight o'clock in the evening. I live two miles and a half from Mr. Jones's. I left the box at my house. I went to town at four o'clock next morning, and informed Mr. Bevan; he came to my house and examined it - I did not think it proper to go to Mr. Jones. I had taken a box to Gray-street from the prisoner on the Tuesday before that, which was very heavy. I took two boxes before.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe you hired the prisoner - A. I did, and received a very good character with him. I hired him in the name of Condell - he now says his name is Connor. I received a verbal character from a person calling himself Captain Graham; I cannot find him now.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES. The plate in the box is all my property, it contains the articles stated in the indictment - there are seventy-nine ounces altogether, and worth above 21 l. - one silver cup weighs one pound.</p>

               <p>Q. How had they got to it - A. By first getting into the beer cellar, which communicates with the street, by a flap that was bolted inside when I went to bed; I found it unbolted, and a little injury done to one side of the flap, by which means an instrument might be put through, and the bolt pushed aside; they could then get into the beer cellar, and force the lock of the spirit cellar-door. I missed a small cag of rum, and went immediately to the watch-house. I was sent from there to Marlborough-street, and found the prisoner under examination, and the cag of rum there - I knew it to be mine. I had received it from Read and Thompson, in the City; my name was chalked on it, and No. 44 was also on it, which agrees with my invoice. I also lost some cloves, and a quantity of brandy and rum. I do not know the prisoner.</p>

            . I am a watchman; my beat is about one hundred and fifty yards from the prosecutor's house. About half-past four o'clock in the morning, I was in Great Portland-street, and crossed over the road to the prisoner, who had the cag. I asked him what he had got? He said he came from Somers'-town, and was going to the Green Man and Still, coach office, with it. I followed him by the Green Man and Still, then secured him, and he threw it down. I took him to the watch-house with it - it contained six gallons of rum.</p>

            . On Monday night, about five o'clock, I saw thirteen sheep, which were delivered by a drover in Mr. Dexter's name. On Tuesday night, as I was sitting by the fire, two men came up to the window; I am sure Bush was one of them, the other man was short and thick; they asked me for Mr. Dexter's sheep? I did not know either of them before. I said,</p>
               <p>"They are in the pen, go and take them." I went in, sat by the fire again, and saw no more. Next morning I found the sheep were gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this - A. About half-past five or six o'clock - it was nearly dusk then; I only knew Bush. I live in a cottage with my father, opposite Bones.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BUSH. Q. Did you see me take them away - A. No. I saw them go up to the pen. I am sure he was one.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the other man like Still - A. Yes, my Lord, it might have been him - I did not see the marks on the sheep.</p>
               <p>SARAH M'GREGOR. I lodge at No. 3, Hamilton-row, Battle Bridge. On the 2d of November, about eight o'clock in the evening, a knock came at the door, and I let Warren in - he keeps a green shop at the house; I sent my daughter for the key of the shop-door. Very soon after some sheep were driven in - Bush stood at the door; they were driven through the passage into a shed at the back of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with them - A. I saw Bush - nobody was with him then; he had either a stick or whip in his hand - I do not know who drove them; I saw the sheep when I was at my window up stairs, but when I went down to open the door, Bush and Warren stood at the door; I let Warren in at the street-door, and sent my daughter for the key of the shop-door, which was brought - they could not open the shop. Bush said to Warren,</p>
               <p>"Push your foot against the door" - I said,</p>
               <p>"You must not do that." I tried to open it with the key, and while I was doing so, I saw Still. The sheep were then in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of the person of Still - A. Yes, I saw them at the house that day between eleven and twelve o'clock - they lunched there; Still went into the shed with his pocket full of skewers - I went to bed between eleven and twelve o'clock, Still and his wife were then in the back parlour, with Warren - Bush was in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the sheep next morning - A. They all hung up in the shed; I never counted them, either at night or in the morning - they were skinned. There were two halves, and the rest carcases. The halves were part of two sheep, which had been cut across.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you - A. My husband is a musician. Warren absconded the night the sheep came. Still visited him.</p>
               <p>Q. Bush and Warren drove them in - A. I let Warren in, Still came in afterwards. He frequently came to visit Warren.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. How long after the sheep came did Still come - A. About a quarter of an hour; he went through the passage with the skewers in his pockets. I do not know what business he is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sized man is Warren - A. A middle size, and thin - about the height of Bush; he is an old man, and rather stoops. Still and Bush both lunched there - about eleven o'clock they all went out together. I did not see them again until they all came back.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH M'GREGOR. I am daughter of the last witness. On the 2d of November, in the evening, I went to fetch the key, when I came out Bush stood at the door with a whip in his hand, there were no sheep at the door, nor had any been brought in then - they were brought in in my absence. I went into the shed about half-past eight o'clock, and saw a man skinning the sheep - he has not been found - Bush was holding the candle to him; a boy was also in the shed. Still, his wife, and Warren were in the parlour. I counted the sheep next morning, there were eleven whole ones, and two hind parts. Still sent me for two pots of beer, which I fetched; he asked me to take a pint into the shed to the man; I did, and then saw Bush there - I saw no more.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You never saw Still in the shed slaughtering the sheep - A. No. Still visited Warren. I never saw his wife there before.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. Did you see Still in the shed - A. Yes, after I had carried in the beer, he had his coat off; his back was towards me - he was doing nothing. His coat was on when I saw him in the parlour.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see him come in at first - A. Yes; he had his right-hand pocket full of large skewers.</p>

On the 2d of November, about eight o'clock at night, I saw some sheep, Bush and Warren were with them; a sheep ran away from the door, I saw Bush run and fetch it back. Warren and Bush drove them in. I thought they were going to open a butcher's shop. In the morning I saw the shop opened as before; I went into the shed about eight o'clock, and saw thirteen whole sheep hanging up, dead. I afterwards saw Bush at the office. I went and informed Cadby, and at night eleven sheep, and two pair of hind-quarters were brought to my house.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH M'GREGOR re-examined. I saw Bush carry one part of a sheep away, and the man who skinned them carried the other.</p>

            . I am an officer of Clerkenwell. I went to No. 3, Hamilton-row, on Wednesday, the 3d of November, about five o'clock in the afternoon, and found eleven whole sheep, and two hind halves, but no skins. I carried them over to Crick's. I and Read apprehended Still between six and seven o'clock that night. I was going to the office with Elizabeth M'Gregor, about a quarter before eight o'clock, and took Bush in a field, he pretended to be easing himself. We told them both what they were taken for. I did not ask where the skins were. Mr. Dexter afterwards saw the carcases in my presence. When I took Still he said he knew nothing of the sheep. I understood he rented the stable of No. 3 - he said he did not rent it.</p>

            . I am a butcher, and live in Paddington-street, Marylebone. On the 1st of November I sent thirteen sheep to Bones' to graze. I sent them by a Smithfield drover - he is an old man, near fifty; four of them were Lincolnshire wethers, and nine were half-bred - they were ewes and wethers. I do not exactly know how many of each.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see the carcases - A. Yes, at Hatton-garden. I saw eleven sheep, and two pair of hind-quarters. Four of them were Lincolnshire wethers, the other nine are half-bred. About three of them are ewes, and the rest wethers.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you form any judgment whether they were yours - A. I have no doubt in my own mind; I bought them on the Monday, and had handled them all. I had bought ten of the Lincolnshire in all - these four corresponded in weight with those I had killed before; each weighed from eleven to twelve stone, and so did these - the nine were a part of a lot of twenty-five. I had killed sixteen, which weighed from eight to nine stone each, and so did the carcases that were found; I saw them at the office on Friday, the 5th of November.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know a half-bred sheep when the skin is off - A. Certainly, by the make of them.</p>

               <p>STILL'S Defence. On Tuesday, the 2d of November, I went into the country to purchase potatoes, which Warren agreed to purchase again. On my return I stopped at the Plough, public-house, Kelsal-green; Mr. Clancey was there, and Mr. Pollard, who is a butcher, and resides in Marylebone-lane. I waited there till about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and enquired if I could purchase any potatoes, then went to Mr. Bell's, Westmoreland Arms, public-house, Manchester-street, Manchester-square, staid there till nearly eight o'clock, and drank several glasses of brandy and water with some friends there, then proceeded home to my stable, No. 8, Smith's-place, Skinner-street, Somers'-town - it was then about nine o'clock. I cleaned my horse, put it up for the night, and then said to my wife,</p>
               <p>"I shall go to Warren, and tell him I have bought no potatoes." She said,</p>
               <p>"You had better take those skewers which you promised to Mr. Warren," which I accordingly did; when I got to the house it was nearly ten o'clock - I found both the doors open, and went into the parlour to Warren; he had a pot of beer by his side. I told him I could buy no potatoes, and sat down; he wished me to lend him 1 s. to get some beer, and I gave the girl one to fetch some; he sent most of it backwards. I staid there till near eleven o'clock, then went home and went to bed. I saw no more of Warren.</p>
               <p>BUSH'S Defence. I was at Edwards's, who keeps the Plough, public-house, Kelsal-green, from four o'clock till about a quarter after six; I then walked home to Edgware-road, at the corner of Connell-place, where my mother lives - it was then about seven o'clock. I was coming down Battle Bridge, and saw Warren, who had some sheep at the door, and asked me to lend him a hand with them. I helped him into the yard with them, and went down to Smithfield, called as I came back, and he asked me to hold the light to the man in the shed, which I did for half an hour, and then went away, got home about eleven o'clock, and did not see Warren or Still afterwards. When I was taken into custody, I was returning from West-street, Smithfield; a gentleman asked me where Still was? I said I did not know, for I had not seen him since last night. He took me to the office; he did not collar me - I did not attempt to run away. Sheppard said at the office that the other man was pock-marked.</p>

He was stooping down, passing a stick inside the window, and dragging something out. I went up to him, and he went away, but I followed him, and secured him with the stick in the hand - he broke a book off it, and threw it on the ground before I took him; he still had the end of the stick, which I produce - it is two sticks tied together.

He said he saw me stooping, and after that I heard them talking. They said Mr. Smith would not prosecute, and they must do it themselves. He then said he thought that I stooped.</p>

On Sunday night week Murray and Parker came to my lodgings about ten o'clock - I was abed; they called out opposite the window, and said Mr. Jordan had some business with me - I said I was coming. I put on my clothes, and went out to them; they were waiting for me by a little gate at a distance - they took me into Jordan's house.</p>
               <p>Q. You went willingly - A. Yes, my Lord, they behaved like friends, sat me in a chair by the fire, and talked to me a great while like friends. Marray and Parker told me that Jordan wanted to settle with me about my money - I had an attachment against him from the Court of Requests.</p>
               <p>Q. They talked friendly with you for sometime - A. Yes, then Churchill put a red rag over my mouth - they covered my mouth and nose. I then felt Weldon come and give me one stab; I received three more, but I do not know who from. All the stabs were on the bony part of my breast - they did not go any great depth.</p>
               <p>Q. You say Weldon gave you one stab - A. Yes, I knew his voice - he was opposite me. I heard

             talking, and have no doubt but it was her who gave me the others, but I do not know. They found me bleeding, brought a sponge to do the blood away, and laid a wet cloth over that; they then threw me down into the cellar, and tied my hands behind me - after throwing me down they tied them as tight as they could, then laid me on my face, and said when the last of the blood was out I should be dead.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you continue in the cellar - A. I fainted away, and am not able to say, but I think I was there a little before twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get away - A. They said I was dead. Churchill gave me a kick on my shoulder, with which I was very bad, and then went out. Murray came down, turned me over, and said,</p>
               <p>"Are yon alive?" then struck me on the ribs, and said I was dead.

             said,</p>
               <p>"You will see he is not, unless his throat is cut;" Murray said I was, and that I had no business there any more. He rose me up, and dragged me up by my coat. Churchill and Weldon dragged me out of the cellar. When I heard them talking about my throat being cut, I pretended to be dead; they rifled my pockets of every thing - of all my papers, and Parker crammed them down my throat with a stick - I heard a noise of water coming in. They washed the rag that was over the sponge, and put it into my pocket with the sponge. They carried me through part of Grub-street, and turned me into a court there - my feet and hands were tied; I felt a rope on my feet as they laid me down, which broke from my legs by my struggling. I was stiffened with cold, and cannot tell how long I laid there. The watchman found me there, and I was taken to the hospital; I was informed that they would wait to see if I stood there, and I stood still. I heard the watchman coming, and made as much noise as I could; he and others came, cut the ropes from my hands, and took me to the watch-house. I told them the rope which tied my legs was broken at the end of the court, and they went and found it there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew very well where they lived - A. Yes, I lodged with them about three weeks before I went to where I now live. I left on account of a dispute with them.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of this dispute you was put in prison - A. Yes, but I had the first warrant against him. I was tried at Clerkenwell - it was done to prevent my appearing in Court; I was only in prison seven days, as the gentlemen found out that it was false. I never said that I would be revenged, and have them all in a string for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Kirby and Griffin - A. Yes, they would hang me if they could - I know Molloy; I never<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010019"/>said so to either of them - they swore any thing against me, but the Magistrate knew them, and would not believe them. They threw me right down the cellar - it hurt me very much, and I was bruised; I went to the hospital that night, and came out two days ago.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after did you try to make your escape from the hospital - A. The doctor told me that I should be discharged next day, I called for my shoes and stockings, but could not get them.</p>
               <p>Q. The nurse removed your shoes and stockings to prevent your escaping, and so you ran away without them - I did, and two of the gentlemen followed me. I said I would not come back. One of the gentlemen said I should catch cold, and so I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. You were taken to the House of Correction since that - A. The officer thought I was going away, in order not to appear here, and I was taken there. He has the rag that was found in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you halloo out - A. No, I could not when I heard about my throat being cut - they took me a great way from their house; I do not know how long I remained in the court. I was carried out a little before twelve o'clock, and the watchman found me there a little after twelve.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were all the persons in the room when you received the stabs - A. I cannot tell, for they were going in and out - my eyes and mouth were bound up.

             DEAN. I am assistant to Mr. Blundell, who is a surgeon, and lives in Chiswell-street. On the morning of the 22d of November I was called out of bed by the watchman, about two o'clock, and saw M'Ginnis at the watch-house very faint and weak. I examined his breast, and found a wound, also one or two scratches, not deserving the name of wounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the wound - A. On the right side of the breast - it was a very superficial wound, by no means likely to be attended with any danger; there was no chance of its being mortal - it was on the bone, in a part not at all dangerous. It was not likely to disable him or do him any grievous bodily harm.</p>
               <p>The Court here informed the Jury, that the charge could not be substantiated, as the wounds were not likely to produce grievous bodily harm, but were inflicted on a part of the breast the least dangerous.</p>

He turned up George-yard, and I followed him about twenty yards, then lost sight of him. I gave information to Lyon at nine o'clock, and described the prisoner to him. I saw him in custody on the Monday following, and am certain he is the person. There was a strong gas light close by.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not go into the Cross Keys, public-house, and point out another person as the man who had robbed you - A. No, I said that man was not so stout. I never said any other person was the man. I never had any doubt of the prisoner being the man.</p>

            , I am a headborough of Whitechapel. I received information of this robbery about nine o'clock on Friday evening, The prosecutor described the man to me, in consequence of which I apprehended the prisoner; I knew him before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you know any thing wrong of me - A. I do not know him to be a common thief, but he is along with a gang. I took the prosecutor to a house that evening, which thieves use. The first house I took him to there were about thirty, but he said the person was not there. I took him to another house, pointed out a man to him, and said,</p>
               <p>"Is he any thing like that man?" He said he was not so stout; he never charged any one with it but the prisoner, and the moment he saw him he identified him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The person who did the robbery is now in custody. I was at home from half-past five o'clock till eleven. I wrote to witnesses to come, but they have not, as I have no money to satisfy them. If I was not innocent I could have got away after I was taken.</p>

On Saturday, the 6th of November, I went out about a quarter before eight o'clock; as I went out I let the prisoner in, he lodged with me once - I left him with my son, who is sixteen years old. I saw my wedding ring safe in a glass on the mantle-piece of the room where they were. I came home about half-past ten o'clock, and in a few minutes I missed it - I found a brass one in the glass in its stead. My ring was stamped with S. G. in the inside. On the 24th of November the prisoner's father came with a man named May - they said they came to talk about the ring. May asked where the glass stood, I shewed him. He went to the mantle-shelf, and was not there a minute before he found the ring in a crevice behind the mantle-shelf. I had looked there numbers of times for it, and am certain it was not there. I had got some small moulds out of that crevice, and am certain it was not there.</p>

The man's father had lived in the house - he said he came to look for the ring. I had looked several times before he did, and am certain it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010020"/>not there. I had put a piece of paper in the crevice four days before. The brass ring was on the mantle-piece, but at some distance from the glass.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know she was his wife - A. She occasionally came to the shop with him as his wife. I do not know whether the prisoner was with her at the time or not. I produced this watch, among others, before the Magistrate, and the prosecutor claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. You have no reason to say he was with her - A. No; I cannot say positively that he was.</p>

On Sunday, the 16th of November, our shop was broken into, and robbed of about 100 lbs. of onion-seed, a box coat, three sacks, and other things.

            . I live in Lower Thames-street. I received a letter from the prosecutor, describing the seed, and begging me to stop it if offered for sale. On Monday week last, the prisoner brought a small sample of onion-seed, and from the description Mr. Moore had given me of the sample, I considered it to be his. I told the prisoner to bring the bulk, and I would take it - he brought it. I told him I did not much like it, and should not pay him for it until he came to town again. He said he came from Sandy, in Bedfordshire - that he should be in town on the Thursday following, and he would call for the money. He brought me thirty-eight pounds; but previous to this he wanted to take it away or have his money. When he found I would not do that he consented to leave it. He left, and I desired my clerk to write to Mr. Moore, and request him to be in town on Thursday. On Thurday Mr. Moore came, and left an officer at our house. Between one and two o'clock the prisoner called for the money - Mr. Moore was waiting in the neighbourhood - the officer went to inform him he was come; he came, and saw the prisoner in our counting-house; he said he knew him, and he was the man he suspected to have committed the robbery. I questioned him about the seed before I sent for the prosecutor - he told me he grew the seed, and that his name was

            . In the afternoon of the 11th of November I was going down Ludgate-street, and saw two young men on the other side of the street - from their appearance and manner I thought they were pickpockets. I turned back to watch them, and saw by their motions they were going to attempt to pick the prosecutor's pocket. Presently I saw one of them with his hand in Mr. Rutherford's pocket, I cannot say which it was. I instantly started across the street to secure them, and met Carney coming out from between two coaches, which stood by the pavement - he was one of them; he was putting on his hat, which was off before. I saw him putting the handkerchief into his hat. I collared him, and took his hat from his hand - he struggled to get from me, but did not succeed. I dragged him into St. Paul's Church-yard after the other two, and got some gentlemen to secure them. I am sure they were all three connected - Walker was one of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The coaches were between them - A. Yes, they stood still. I saw them pick his pocket - I think the man who escaped did it. The other men kept on the same side.</p>

On the 25th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I had been to wait on some customers in the neighbourhood, and on my return I found the prisoner in the shop - she had a ribbon drawer before her, with a quantity of ribbons out. I went round the counter, and spoke to her; she told me there was none in that drawer that she liked. I showed her another, which contained various pieces, and from that drawer she took this piece, with her handkerchief; she then asked to see some plaid ribbons, and from that drawer she took two pieces. During this time she had bought ribbons amounting to 1 l. 16 s. 3 d.; she tendered me 18 d., saying, she would call again. I asked her name? she said it was Clements, and said she had a sister living in the neighbourhood, and she would call as she came back. I said 18 d. was but a small deposit to leave on so large an amount, and would she be sure and call? she said she was going to drink tea with her sister, and wanted some handkerchiefs, and would be sure to call. She was about to leave the shop, I took her by the right arm into the back parlour, in passing from the shop to the parlour, she threw two pieces of ribbon out of her pocket. I then told her to take the remainder out of her pocket; she said she had nothing. On searching her person I found nothing in her pocket, but 12 s. 8 d. in her purse, and another purse, which contained duplicates. I found another piece under the chair on which she sat. I saw her take them all three. I sent for an officer, but he found nothing more. Her husband was outside the window, looking through, I seized him, but found nothing on him.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Pocock, of St. Bride's wharf. On the 12th of November, I was in Old-street, and saw the prisoner there - I knew him by sight before. I saw him riding furiously along, full gallop, without a saddle - he had a bridle I believe. I first saw him about forty yards from the turnpike; he passed through the turnpike at the same rate, without stopping to pay - I was about two hundred yards from him at first. The last witness who was just examined, was crossing, and had just passed the locked gate with the infant in her arms. The prisoner's horse struck the little girl, and forced the infant out of her arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the horse struck it - A. Yes. I called to the prisoner several times to stop, before he passed me - he would not stop; I called to him after, he had looked round, and must have seen the child, lying there. He saw himself pursued and called to, but still rode on, but an alarm being given, and seeing that he must be stopped, he at last pulled up. I went up, and laid hold of his bridle - another person came up, and joined me. I said it was a pity there was not an officer at hand to give him in charge. The person said he was an officer, and I gave him in charge - he got off his horse, and I told him he had rode over a child. He treated it with the greatest indifference, and said,</p>
               <p>"Don't make a fuss, it can't be helped" - he was very much intoxicated; I left him in charge. The child was taken into a doctor's.</p>
               <p>Q. When first you saw him, was the horse gallopping - A. It was. I swear the horse struck against the child; the road being wide, I could see what happened four hundred yards off; the horse struck the girl, which caused her to drop it. If a waggon had been passing he must have dashed the horse to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. If it was a restive horse, might it not have run away with him - A. Certainly, but he had an opportunity of stopping it, for finding he was pursued, and that it would be useless to ride any farther, he pulled the horse in momentarily.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. Did you see the horse ride away with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When he passed you did he appear to be trying to stop, or encouraging the horse to go on - A. Encouraging the horse to go on.</p>

            . I keep the turnpike gate. On Friday, the 12th of November, between one and two o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came gallopping through the gate - he had paid the toll that morning; I knew him - he passed through with speed. The little girl was crossing with her brother from Brick-lane to Golden-lane. They were about five or six yards from the gate.</p>
               <p>Q. Could he see them - A. Yes, there was nothing to prevent his seeing them - there was no building in the way. When he was near to them, he cried out,</p>
               <p>"Halloo!" He saw them within a yard of him - the face of the horse knocked the little one out of the girl's arms. I did not perceive what part of the horse struck her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The gate is on the left side of the road, and the tollhouse on the right. The children were crossing from the left.</p>

            . I am a surgeon and apothecary, and live in Old-street. On Friday, the 12th of November, about two o'clock, in the afternoon, the little boy was brought to my house in a state of insensibility. I examined him. There was extravasated blood, and a bruise over the right eye, on the side of the temple; I attended him till he died. From the time it was brought into my shop it remained in that insensibility. On the Monday its right side became completely paralysed, and the next day it died. I attended it at the father's house, Silver-street, Bridgewater-gardens.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010024"/>The body was opened, and there was an extensive inflamation on the surface of the brain, and a portion of matter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cause of its death - A. The contusion in consequence of the blow - there was a large quantity of of water in the ventricles of the brain, but in my judgment it died from the contusion.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The child had a water head, that was a disease independent of the blow - A. Yes. I impute the death to the contusion. The prisoner was brought to my shop on the day of the accident, and said if I would do every thing that was necessary, he would pay me.</p>

               <p>JOSIAH PAWNEY. I live with my parents in Sidney-grove, City-road. On a Saturday, the latter end of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I was in the City-road, and saw a stage coach gallopping up the road - the name of Morris was on it; another was behind it with the word Times on it - that was also running.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they racing - A. No, but the hindermost one was gallopping to come even with the other, just at the <placeName id="t18191201-37-crimeloc214">crossing by the New River</placeName>

The Times went on, but this coach stopped immediately; the prisoner drove it. The road is wide enough for three carriages to pass.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the man - A. He bled at the top of the eye. The prisoner got down, picked him up, and assisted in putting him into a coach; he was taken to the hospital. I saw him afterwards when I was examined before the Coroner - he was then dead.</p>
               <p>Q. At what distance did you see the prisoner gallopping - A. Just by. He pulled up as soon as the man was knocked down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you know the man - A. I have often seen him. I do not know whether he was deaf, or whether his sight was bad - he was lame. I have no reason to suppose he was drunk.</p>

The prisoner drove it. They were both Paddington coaches.</p>
               <p>Q. If the prisoner kept in the line behind the Times, would he have gone clear of the man - A. Yes; three carriages might pass in the road.

            . I am a surgeon. On a Saturday morning the deceased was brought to the hospital; there was an extensive laceration of the scalp, and the bone left completely bare; he had also a contusion of the collar bone, a contusion on the eye, and a considerable injury was done to the chest. He lived until the 24th of November, and then died. The accident itself was serious, and I should apprehend dangerous in any case, but his constitution was much impaired by intemperance and age. I have no hesitation in saying, be died from the injury; but at the same time the same extent of injury might not have occasioned the death of an individual younger, and one whose constitution was better - he was deaf and lame. The injury was likely to be occasioned by a stage-coach coming against him. He came to the hospital by the name of

I hallood to him, but before I could stop my horses they knocked him down. When I was on him I was afraid stop till I passed - I then got off, and afforded him all the assistance I could. and am seriously concerned, but I could not avoid it. I was not gallopping. I had been endeavouring to overtake the Times that it might not take up my passengers at the Blue Coat Boy.</p>

On the 11th of November I came home as the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010025"/>watchman was going one o'clock at night, between Thursday and Friday. I saw three men on the opposite side of the way; I did not know them, and do not know whether the prisoner was one or not. I am always in the habit of trying the bar of my shutters, which I did, and found it was all right. I have six shutters, and a bar runs across them all, it was safe. I heard nothing till between six and seven o'clock, when my wife alarmed me. I went down in about a quarter of an hour, it was then past seven. The shutters had been taken down by my servant. I found eight dozen of ivory-handled knives and forks gone from the front of the window, a pane was broken - I suppose they had been drawn through that pane. On Saturday, the 13th of November, I saw two dozen and a half of knives and forks at Marlborough-street, and two dozen of table knives and forks, and a pair of fancy buck carvers, which I had lost - the two dozen and a half were in the hands of the pawnbroker, the others the officer had - they are my own make.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am servant to Mr. Baker, who is a pawnbroker, and lives in High Holborn. On Friday, the 12th of November, between one and two o'clock in the day, the prisoner came in, and offered to pledge two dozen of knives and forks, I asked him whose they were? he said they belonged to a person outside the door, who had sent him in. I immediately ordered the apprentice to shut the street-door - the prisoner seemed very much confused, and wished two or three times to go out to find the person whom, he said, had sent him in. I would not let him. I sent for an officer; he was taken into custody, and searched in my presence, and in his pocket were found two wires, one of which had a sharp hook at the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you judge the purport of them - A. They are calculated to draw any thing out of a shop through the window - I know no honest purpose to which they are applicable. While I was gone to Marlborough-street, two dozen of knives and forks were found in the same box in which the prisoner had stood. He was not half an hour in the shop; they were found within an hour after he left. A woman who came in found them, she is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. The boxes are private - A. Yes, he came into a private box - it was there I secured him. I would not let him go out, fearing he might escape.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not desire Mr. Barker to go out and look for the person - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not write to Mr. Barker to inquire for the woman who found them, and stop her - A. He received such a letter.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did he bring large or small knives - A. One dozen of large and one dozen of small.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you remember my saying I refused to take them of the man, but he said he could not take them in, as he was a ruler in the King's Bench, and had broken his rule - A. He said they belonged to a man who was a ruler in the King's Bench.</p>

             re-examined. The knives and forks are mine. The large ones are worth 44 s. a dozen, and the others 36 s. I had sold none of this pattern.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I received the property, and did not know it was stolen. As to the wire, I can answer that charge by a person I used part of it for in mending a jack-towel roller and umbrella. I went to the next-door neighbour, and borrowed a hammer and file to break the wire off - I rolled it up, and put it into my pocket. If I had intended to dispose of the knives I should never have said they belonged to another person, I should have carried them a great way off. The prosecutor said the knives had been rubbed.</p>

            . The prisoner used the wire to put up a jack-towel of mine. I live at No. 29, Kensington Gravelpits. He put up the towel on a Thursday, about a month ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was so much as a month ago - A. I believe so; he is a currier - he is no relation of mine. I have known him nine months. He has slept in my house for these last four months. He put the wire at each end of the roller - he said he bought it in town.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a single woman - A. Yes. The prisoner slept in the first floor, I slept on the second. I am independent. I do not know of his having any knives, or cleaning any. He had been out of business some months, and boarded with me, on a promise of payment when he was able. I have known him by name nine years, and personally more than twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember the day he was taken up - A. I do; it is three weeks ago - I believe he had been using the wire the week before that. When I first saw him in town he was a leather-shaver, and worked for Mr. Tales, of Bermondsey. I went there to see him with a friend, when I first came to town.</p>

             re-examined. He had put the small wire on the top of an umbrella.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you remember the Thursday night before he was taken up - A. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did he come in - A. Nearly upon seven o'clock, and went to bed about ten. I went to bed at the same time, as soon as I had fastened the house. I locked it, and took the key into my own room, which was also locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How do the windows of the lower room fasten - A. With a bolt fastened to the shutter. I locked the parlour, and took the key of that into my room also. The back door has a bolt, but no lock - it leads into a small yard which communicates with other houses. There is a garden at the end of it, paled round, it leads to a back way.</p>
               <p>Q. A person can get over the pales - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010026"/>Q. How can you be sure he did not get up and go out while you was asleep - A. I had the key. There is a lock to his room. I always take the key of his door up stairs myself. There are only three rooms in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he was locked in - A. He was locked in - I had the key of his door. My sister slept in the room with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of a window is there to his room - A. There is a sash window back and front, nearly as high as I can reach from the ground.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There are three rooms, the parlour and two bed rooms - the bed room stairs come into the parlour. I could not get to the back door, as the parlour door was locked. As to the property, it is not likely that a person who got it honestly would give it to me to dispose of - no doubt they stole it. I have tried all I could to make a discovery on the subject. I am really innocent, I call God to witness it. I had no motive - every prospect in life was before me. I could have a hundred pounds if I asked for it. There is a case which will shortly come before the Court, where a person was waylaid into a public-house. Folly is no crime - I have suffered for it.</p>

He said Yes, he took her down into the country with him, within about a mile and a half of his father's. He said he took her out of my master's yard between eight and nine o'clock on Sunday night.

            . I am a constable. In consequence of suspicion, I went with Allen in pursuit of the prisoner; we went to Wormley, and on Thursday we went on the road to Sapswell, and found the prisoner there. I jumped out of the chaise, and collared him - he was going towards town, quite a different road from the Edmonton road. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are my prisoner;" he said,</p>
               <p>"I don't know that." I asked him what he had done with Cobbett's mare? He said he knew nothing of it; Allen was then in the cart, and in hearing. I afterwards left him with Allen. I found the mare at the Red Lion, public-house, at Callow, Rattan, Suffolk, within a mile and a half of his father's. I knew his father lived there; I brought the mare back, and knew her to belong to Cobbett - she is here to day. I attended before Mr. Mores, the Magistrate; and saw him write and sign this paper; I also saw the prisoner put his mark to it. No promise or threat was used to him; it was taken from his own mouth, and read over to him - Rattan is about fifty-six miles, and Wormley eight from Edmonton - (read).</p>
               <p>"The prisoner being asked if he is Guilty or Not Guilty, says,</p>
               <p>'I am Guilty, I took the mare on Sunday night from Cobbett's stable, rode away to Suffolk, about sixty miles, and stopped at Buckeridge for refreshment, and said, I was going to Cambridge, stopped about five miles from Cambridge, and said I was going to a clergyman with the mare. I rode across the country, and proceeded to Rattan, put up at the Red Lion, and told them it was my master's,

As I was returning I met the prisoner on the middle of London Bridge; he asked me where I was going? and I told him. He said he was going to Arundel-street, Strand, and would shew me a nearer way than I was going. He took me through Lombard-street, and when we got to Cornhill he asked me to have some beer? he took me up a court to a public-house, and as I was going in at the door, he took the bundle off my head, and laid it on the taproom table, called for a pint of beer, and sent me for half a pound of black pudding; when I returned he was gone with the bundle. On the Monday following, I saw him crying matches at the top of a court, knew him again, and fetched my master, who secured him. I am certain he is the person. I observed him particularly.</p>

I went there, told his wife what I came for, and she immediately attempted to throw some duplicates on the fire, but I seized her hand, and took them from her; they related to the property produced. I searched her, and found other duplicates of her own property. In the room I found a quantity of linen, and two pair of black worsted, and a pair of black silk stockings, and a piece of wrapper - they were taken before the Alderman. She was discharged on producing a certificate of her marriage to the prisoner.</p>

As I turned to look after him, a woman said he had got some meat out of the shop - I pursued, and secured him five or six yards from the shop. I found the half-round of beef on him, and the other meat. He said it did not belong to me; I said it did, and that he must go back - he said he would not, and fell down. He said,</p>

I handed them to him, he took them in his hand to look at them, said they were too dear, and wished for some at a lower price. I turned round to a glass case behind me, to reach some, he opened the street-door, and ran out with the handkerchiefs. I called the servant down, ran after him, and told a man to stop him - he was stopped. He dropped two handkerchiefs, and two others were found on him.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Long-lane. On the 5th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner brought me a volume of Langhall's Plutarch, and asked if I would purchase them? I said I would if he had the whole - there are eight volumes in all. He went away, and returned in half an hour with the remainder. I asked him whose they were? he said they were not his, but a young man's, named Hawkes, who lived in Old-street. He asked 15 s. for them - I asked him if he could not take 8 s. I said I had no change, but our lad should fetch some. In the mean time an officer, whom I had sent for, came - I told him the circumstance, and he was taken into my room. The officer and my boy went out, and brought in two more men - the prisoner said neither of them was Hawkes, and they knew nothing about it.</p>

On Saturday, the 27th of November, about twelve o'clock, I had two crates of glass and three boxes in my caravan.

A man stood against the wall, and said I could not go down. I said I would take the box and leave it, and asked him to mind the horse that it did not go any further. I left two crates and a box in the caravan - I took the other box to the coach-office; and when I got within a dozen yards of the corner of Wood-street, coming to Cheapside, I saw the prisoner take the box from the caravan, put it on his shoulder, and walk outside the caravan in the road. I collared him on the pavement, about a dozen yards from the horse. I had asked him what he was going to do with the box? he said a person had hired him to carry it. I said that was impossible, for I saw him take it out of the caravan, and put it on his shoulder. Another man took the box off his shoulder. He said,</p>

               <p>"Now, as you have got your property, why can't you let me go?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Had you made your escape with this glass you did not care if I had lost my place, and died in a workhouse." Worrall took him.</p>

            . I was standing at the corner of Earl-street about three o'clock, as the Lord Mayor's procession was landing. I observed the prisoner, with three or four more lads, looking at different peoples' pockets, but saw him take nothing. He then went towards Mr. White, who was standing with two females. I saw two lads, one at each of his pockets. I saw the prisoner draw his hand from the prosecutor's pocket, and attempt to put the handkerchief into his coat-pocket - I immediately collared him, and informed Mr. White. He looked round - I saw the handkerchief on the ground, and picked it up.</p>

On Sunday, the 26th of September, about two o'clock, the two prisoners came in a one horse chaise, with a woman - the chaise drove up to the door. Keaton came in, and asked if his master could dine there that day? I said Yes, and he went out again. All three came in, and were shewn into a room, where they ordered dinner - I laid the cloth, and waited on them at dinner; they all three dined together. Directly after dinner they ordered the bill, which I took them - the amount was 14 s. 3 d. The prisoner, Voss, gave me a 5 l. Bank of England note, and told me to take the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed - A. As a naval officer, in a uniform coat. I took the note to my master, who was outside the door, and asked him if I should ask the name? He said, No, he wished he had a hundred of them. I gave him the note, and he gave me four 1 l. notes, and 4 s. 9 d. in change, which I gave to Voss; he gave me 1 s., and ordered the horse to be put to. They went away - they staid there about an hour and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you swear they are the same persons, though they are differently dressed - A. Yes, I am sure they are the same - we had not much company that day. I gave the note to my master - he had no other note in his hand; he stood at the street door; I saw him give the note to my mistress at the bar. I do not know what she did with it.</p>

            . I keep the Red Lion, public-house, at Hampton, in Middlesex. On Sunday, the 26th of September, I saw the prisoners at my house with a young woman - they dined there. I went into the room once while they were at dinner - they were all sitting down to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any note from your servant - A. Yes, a 5 l. Bank note. I looked at it to see if it was good, approved of it, and gave it to my wife to write on, which she did in my presence. I know her hand-writing - this is it - (looking at it) - it has,</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You told your servant it was a good note - A. I said I wished I had a hundred of them - I thought it was a good one. My wife did not go to the till; I did not compare it with another note. I had no other 5 l. note.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you part with it - A. I paid it to Meux and Co., my brewers, on the Wednesday following; it was returned to me as forged that day month, when the clerk came to collect again. My wife took no other 5 l. note that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pay the brewer any other 5 l. note - A. I am not certain.</p>

            . I keep the Boston Arms, public-house, at Turnham Green, in Middlesex. On Sunday, the 26th of September, about four or five o'clock in the afternoon - I cannot exactly say the time, the prisoner, Voss, I am certain, came in a one horse chaise with another young man, and a young woman.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not certain as to the other lad - A. No, I think it was the same, but cannot swear to him, Two men came up, at the same time; one of them said,</p>
               <p>"This young man (meaning Voss) has fallen out, and hurt his arm." Voss said he had hurt his arm, and wished to have something to rub it with - the party went into my parlour together; I took him some vinegar, and rubbed his arm myself. He called for some brandy and water, which he had, he then ordered each of the other men a glass of rum. He said</p>
               <p>"Give each of these men a bottle of rum," I said,</p>
               <p>"Why, I dare say they don't desire a bottle of rum each." He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, give them each a bottle of rum, for I don't wish any one to do any thing for me without being paid for it." I gave them each a bottle; the reckoning came to about 10 s. 8 d. Voss came to the bar, and gave me a 5 l. note. I said,</p>
               <p>"Sir, I have not got change in the house for a 5 l. note." He said,</p>
               <p>"You must get me change, for I have no small change to pay you." I then called my man, Stephens, who held the horse at the door, and told him to go to Mr. Ward's, my baker, for change. I gave him the note, and he brought the change. I put it on the counter, and Voss took it up.</p>
               <p>- Q. Did you ask his name and address - A. I gave him a pen and ink to write, but whether he did or not, I do not know - they then went away; the note came back to me as forged. Voss was dressed in a midshipman's uniform.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What did you do with it after it was brought back - A. I gave it to Mr. Christmas. I am sure Voss is the man, who wore the naval uniform. The other two men were not at the bar when he gave me the note. I can swear Voss was the man.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. You rubbed his arm - A. Yes; he took his coat off - I noticed his coat. I talked very little to him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which way did the chaise come - A. The Brompton Road way, which would be the way from Hampton.</p>

On the 26th of September I remember the prisoners coming, I can swear to Voss, but not to the other; Voss was in a midshipman's dress, the other was a lad the same size as Keaton - to the best of my knowledge he is the person, but I will not swear to him; a young woman was in the chaise with them. Two men came up at the same time. The party went into the parlour, and I held the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress call you in - A. Yes. When Voss came to the bar to pay her, she called me, and gave me a 5 l. note, which I carried to Mr. Ward - it was the same note, and he gave me change.</p>

            . I keep the Three Pigeons,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010031"/>public-house, at Stratford Green. On the 30th of September I remember Voss coming to my house with another young man, whom I cannot swear to - he was the same size as Keaton.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure it was not Keaton - A. I have every reason to believe he is the same person - I have no doubt but he is the same; they came between two and four o'clock in a one horse chaise. Voss was dressed in a naval uniform. When they first drew up to the door, the younger one got out, and asked me if I sold wine? I said Yes. Voss got out, and went into the parlour - both came into the house. Voss asked for a bottle of Port and one of sherry, which I served - it came to 12 s. 9 d. with the bottles. Voss offered me a 5 l. note, which he took out of a pocket-book. I said I was not sure whether I could change it; the young one took the wine, and I went to get change.</p>
               <p>Q. When you said you was not sure whether you could give change, what did he say - A. He said,</p>
               <p>"Can you change a 15 l. note I then?" - I saw another note with the 5 l. note. I asked him for his address; he gave me,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Wilson, near the stairs, Blackwall" - (looks at a note) - this is it; I wrote that on it; I gave him the change, and nothing more passed. He said he should want four bottles more as he returned, but I saw no more of him. I wrote on it in his presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When he gave you the note, the lad was not by - A. No, he was putting the wine into the chaise.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak with certainty to the young one - A. I have no doubt of him from his size and appearance.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not from hearing circumstances from witnesses, rather than from your own observation that you say he is the man - A. No, it is entirely from my own observation. I will not swear to him, but I entertain no doubt - he was not by when I gave Voss the change.</p>
               <p>GEORGE JUDGE. I am waiter at the Angel, public-house, at Ilford, kept by Mrs. Ashmole; it is nine miles from the Three Pigeons, public-house - I know Voss. On the 30th of September I saw him with a lad.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the other prisoner - what is your belief - A. He is about the same size. I cannot say whether he is or is not the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see Voss - A. At the Angel, at Ilford, in the street - I stood at the gateway. They came up together in a one horse chaise, from the London way; they went a little way by the gateway, and then stopped - it was between three and four o'clock, as near as I can guess; Voss was dressed as a naval officer. He turned his head round, and said,</p>
               <p>"Waiter, can I have any thing to eat here?" I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, you can." He said,</p>
               <p>"You had better draw the chaise into the yard" - I said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, it will be safer there" - they did so. Voss got out, and I shewed him into a room up stairs; the lad dined with him there. I asked Voss if he would have hot or cold? He said he should like a nice rump steak, and I ordered it. He rang the bell, and told me to send the lad up stairs, which I did; he rang the bell afterwards, and ordered a bottle of wine, which I took him - they then had their dinner, and a pot of ale; the reckoning came to 11 s. Voss gave me a 5 l. note, which I took to my mistress immediately, and she gave me three 1 l. notes, and 1 l. 9 s. in silver. I took it up to him, and he gave me 1 s., followed me down stairs, and drove towards London. They were there about three quarters of an hour.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You put no name on it - A. No. The young man acted as servant, and attended the gig - he was in the room when I took the change, and when the note was paid. They both came down stairs together.</p>

I took it out at night, took it up stairs for safety, and brought it down again the next morning; I had no other 5 l. note.

            . My father keeps the Green Gate, at Plaistow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of the prisoner's come to your father's house - A. Yes, both of them. I only know Voss; another was with him, about the same size as Keaton - Voss was dressed in a naval uniform. The boy asked if we sold wine? I said we did - they came in a gig. Voss then got out, came into the bar, and asked for two bottles of wine, which came to 13 s. 8 d. - the boy did not come into the house. He paid me a 5 l. note; I examined it - I was some time at the bar. He came out of the parlour, and I told him I was fearful I could not change it. He said it was a very good one, that I need not be afraid, for he had it at the Bank that morning; that satisfied me, and I changed it. I took it up stairs immediately, and put it into the drawer, out of which I took some other notes to give him change. I laid the note on the top, locked the drawer, came down, and gave him the change. They went away.</p>
               <p>Q. Some time after that you had some information - A. Two persons came the same day, and asked me if I had changed a note? I said Yes, and sent my sister, Louisa, to fetch it down - I gave her the key. She brought me a 5 l. note down, and it was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you write on it - A. Yes, an hour after; I never lost sight of it, and am sure it is the note my sister brought me. This is it - (looking at it). I wrote on it,</p>
               <p>"Stranger, September 30, A S." I then sent after the prisoners, but could not have them overtaken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many 5 l. notes had you - A. I do not think I had any; I rubbed the note when Voss stood at the door. I thought him a suspicious character, and rubbed it.</p>

            , at Plaistow; the prisoners both came to our house on the 30th of September; both came to my door in a single horse chaise, about five o'clock. Voss was dressed in a uniform.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the other dressed - A. I cannot particularly say. I noticed his features more than his dress; he appeared like a servant to Voss. Voss asked for a bottle of Port wine and one of sherry, which I gave to him, and told him not to shake it. He said that was of no consequence, and put it into the seat of the chaise; he was at the door with a little pocket-book in his hand, and appeared to have more notes. I saw a 20 l. and a 5 l. note - he gave me the 5 l. note, and I gave him the change. I threw the note on the table, and asked a friend, who was in the bar, what he thought of it? He thought it a good one. I marked it September 30., and blotted it - (looks at it) - this is is it; it has,</p>

               <p>"September 30, M. Cobley," in my hand-writing - I gave it to Mr. Christmas, the Bank inspector. I am positive it was never out of my sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not send your servant with it to a neighbour to ask if it was good - A. No, it was never out of my sight until I marked it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Look at the lesser boy, and say if you think him the other one - A. I have not the smallest doubt; I took particular notice of them both. I wrote on the note directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Keaton by at the time Voss paid you - A. They were both at the door. I think he must have seen him pay me, and have seen me give change. He was not attending to the gig, for the hostler was minding that.</p>
               <p>HARRIET HODGSON. I keep the Britannia, at Limehouse. On the 30th of September, Voss, I am certain, came to my house with another - I do not speak positively to Keaton, It was a lad very much like him - they were in a one horse chaise. About six o'clock in the evening, they passed the door a very little way, then came back and got out; the horse's head was towards London. Both came in, and asked if I had any good wine? I said I had. Voss ordered a bottle of white and one of red; he paid me a 5 l. note - the lad was out of doors, when he paid me. I called to my sister for a pen and ink, and asked him his name? He said he was lame in his right hand, for he had hurt it, and requested me to write it. I asked him his name again? He said,</p>
               <p>"Brown, No. 15, Oxford Road." I handed the note to my sister, and saw her write that on it. This is it - (looking at it) - they then went away. I know of no Oxford Road, East.</p>

               <p>"Here, Jack, take these two bottles." He took them in the chaise, and put them in a case made on purpose.</p>

On the 30th of September, I remember two men coming to my master's shop - I am positive to the short one, Keaton I have no doubt of the other - he was dressed in a naval uniform; they came with a horse and gig, about seven o'clock in the evening, or a little after; the one in the uniform spoke first. He wanted a silk hat, and I fitted him He then called the young one by some christian name, and he came in. Voss told me to fit him with one too. I wished to persuade him to have a beaver one, but he said they only wanted it for a Sunday or two, while on shore and would have a silk one - I fitted Keaton. The elder one took a pocket-book out of his pocket, and gave me a 5 l. Bank note - he had another note, which I think was a 50 l.; he gave me the 5 l. note. I immediately took it to Mr. Shuttleworth, who is a neighbour, and he gave me four 1 l. notes, and 1 l. in silver for it. I returned, and gave the elder one two 1 l. notes, and 1 l. in silver. I gave Keaton the two hats, and he put them into the gig.</p>

On a Thursday in September - I think it was the 30th, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner, Voss, and a lad about the same size as Keaton, came to me - I am sure Voss was one. He ordered a superfine blue coat, a black kerseymere waistcoat, and a pair of blue trowsers; they were for the lad. I measured him, and the clothes were to be ready on the Friday evening.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker, and live at Chatham. On the 6th of October I remember Keaton coming to my shop about half-past seven o'clock in the evening; he was dressed in a naval uniform. While he was there, I saw Voss looking through the window; he was dressed in a blue great coat, buttoned very close round his throat, and appeared as if he was examining the shoes through the window, while I was serving Keaton. From his appearance I judged him to be a master's mate.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Keaton ask for - A. A pair of boots - I had none to fit him; he then asked for a pair of shoes, I fitted him with them. He gave me a 5 l. Bank note, I requested him to write his name on it, he said he could not write. I asked his name and address? he told me his name was Johnson, and he belonged to the Royal frigate, which I wrote on the note before him - (looks at it). I wrote,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Johnson, Royal frigate, R. O." I afterwards wrote the rest of my name. The shoes came to 8 s. 6 d. I gave him the change.</p>

He took a red memorandum-book out of his pocket, and from between the leaves he gave me a 5 l. Bank note. I said I hoped it was a good one - he said he should be very sorry if it was not. I held it up to the light, told him I must send it out for change, and asked him to put his name on the back - he said he could neither write nor read.

            . I am a linen-draper, and live on St. Margaret's Bank, Rochester. On the 6th of October Keaton came and bought some silk handkerchiefs of me; he paid me a 5 l. note, which I put into the till - nobody but my wife and I have access to the till - I did not mark it. I asked him when he was going to sail? he said in about a fortnight, and that the ship laid in the dockyard. About an hour after, I took the note out of my till and put it into my pocket. There was no other there at that time. I marked it at Gravesend - this is it - (looks at it).</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of suspicions, did you not go in search of the prisoners that evening - A. Yes, about an hour after I took it. I went through different towns, and made inquiry. I went to Gravesend, and found the two prisoners in bed together at the Three Daws, about a quarter after twelve o'clock - the landlord was gone to bed also.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went into the room where they were in bed was Everest with you - He was in the house. The landlord, and a man whom I got, were with me. We found three beds in the room, the two prisoners were in one bed. Only one bed was unoccupied, and on that spare bed the naval uniform laid.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said to them about the uniform - A. Both denied it, and said they had never seen it, nor wore such a thing. After searching the clothes they dressed themselves.</p>
               <p>Q. When they had dressed themselves were their clothes complete - A. No. Voss dressed himself without a waistcoat; he said the uniform waistcoat was not his. Without that, there was only one waistcoat between them. They had both dark blue great coats. Keaton had a blue coat over his uniform when he came to my shop. We found in the midshipman's coat pocket two guineas and three seven-shilling pieces - we also found in the pantaloons pockets 14 s. in one and 18 s. in the other; also a gold seal and a key. Each of them had pantaloons, and there was silver in each. I do not know which had the key and seal. Voss afterwards claimed the gold, and got it away from us. We made them undress two or three times, but could not find it. In a bundle on the table we found the handkerchiefs I sold to Keaton.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine the bed in which they laid - A. Yes, and under the feather-bed, in the middle of the sacking, there was a pocket-book, the same sort as that which Keaton had in my shop. We found eighteen 1 l. local and Bank notes in it, and by the side of the pocket-book was another roll of notes, folded into three parts, about the size of the pocket-book. I think there were eight 1 l. notes, and outside the eight were two 5 l. notes - I took them into my possession, put them into my hat, and put my hat on my head for security. I desired the prisoners to wait while we marked the notes, that there might be no confusion. I believe I omitted marking eight of the notes in consequence of what Keaton did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the two 5 l. notes - A. I had them inside my hat, which was on the top of the bureau; Voss immediately walked behind the landlord, made a snatch over my head, caught the two 5 l. notes up, and put them in his mouth. We immediately seized him by the throat, to prevent his swallowing them - he gave a gulp and said they were gone. He said,</p>
               <p>"You can't blame me for what I have done - you may do your best," or</p>
               <p>"your worst" - I do not know which. I told him he had done the worst thing he could. I gave the property to Everest. (Looks at two fragments of notes) - these are parts of the two I found under the bed, and which I saw him put into his mouth.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You went for the purpose of apprehending them - A. No. They denied that the clothes belonged to them. I believe I said I was positive they were the clothes I saw them in. I was determined to bring them to justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say it would be better if they told the whole truth - A. I do not remember it.</p>

I produce two silk handkerchiefs, a pair of shoes, a pair of gloves, two silver watches, three keys, and two seals on one of them, and a watch and chain without; also a ring, two guineas, another seal, a brooch, a key, and 18 s. in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. We have heard about the notes that were found - A. Here are twenty-five 1 l. notes - seventeen in one parcel and eight in another, and two 5 l. notes. I marked them. Voss seized them - the last witness's account is correct - (looks at two 5 l. notes) - they are those I marked, and which Voss put into his mouth. Rivers gave them to me next morning, about eight o'clock, at the Three Daws. I took the prisoners from the Three Daws to prison, about half-past one o'clock in the morning of the 7th - I took them along High-street.</p>

He came for it on the Tuesday evening following, and asked for Mr. Moss, he was not at home. He asked if the coat was done? I said it was, and asked him to try it on - he said he could not, for he had fallen down the hatchway. His arm was in a sling. He asked me to take a pocket-book out of his pocket, which I did, and laid it on the counter; he took a 5 l. note out and gave me - I marked it; this is it - (looking at it).

            . I am a tailor, and live in Moor-street, Soho. On the 30th of August Voss ordered two pair of trowsers, and three waistcoats; one waistcoat was blue, and was to have anchor buttons. They were to be ready on the 1st of September. He came for them, but they were not quite ready, and he waited half an hour while they were finished; the price was 5 l. 8 s. - he had left 3 s. as a deposit. He had his arm in a sling, and I could not try them on. He asked me to put my hand into his left hand pocket, and take a pocket-book out? which I did; he gave me a 5 l. note, and said his uncle was Mr. Wilson, who resided in the Tower, and had a situation under Government. I marked the note - this is it - (looking at it) - it has</p>

            , Esq., No. 15, Guildford-street. He was dressed as a gentleman's servant, with a linen jacket on. I wrote the name and address on it, and put it into the till - (looks at one) - this is it. My master was behind the counter. I found we had not change enough in the till, and asked Mr. Buckthorp for some silver. The prisoner then said he might as well take the tea from our shop. He had a quarter of a pound of 10 s. tea, and a pound of sugar, which came to 4 s. 7 d. together. My master gave me the silver, and I gave the prisoner the change. My master then took the note out of the till, and said he did not like it - the prisoner took it out of his hands, and said he did not see where the deficiency was; he asked Mr. Buckthorp how he could tell? - my master said he was satisfied it was a bad one, and that he should not let it go out of his possession. He took it out of the prisoner's hands, and asked what Mr. Greaves was? he at first said he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010037"/>a gentleman - my master asked him afterwards, and he said he was an East India merchant. He then asked him where his counting-house was? he said in Lothbury, but he did not know the number - that the cook had taken the note of a butcher in Guildford-street, and upon my suggestion, Mr. Buckthorp went out with him to see if the address was right - they returned in five or ten minutes.</p>

            . I have heard the account given by the last witness, it is correct. I left the shop with the prisoner - we went down Spencer-street; I then thought he wished to get from me. I said,</p>
               <p>"Do you live with Mr. Greaves?" he said he did, but had not lived long there. He appeared to be trying to get from me - I collared him, and said,</p>
               <p>"You do not live with Mr. Greaves," he said he did. I said,</p>
               <p>"I am sure you do not." He caught hold of the iron rails and said,</p>
               <p>"Pray let me go, and I will tell you." I said he should not, and took hold of him. Two men, who were standing by, refused to assist me. I took him back to my shop - several of my neighbours asked me to let them see the note. I never lost sight of it - they gave the note into my hands. The prisoner arose, made a snatch at it, and put it into his mouth. My lad, who was by, made a snatch at it, pulled a piece off, and said,</p>
               <p>"I have got the number!" Mr. King, who stood by, caught hold of him by the throat, and we wrenched the note out of his mouth; the prisoner caught hold of it with his hand, I got it from him, pasted it together, and gave him in charge. I marked the note. He was searched, and four keys, 2 3/4 d., and a piece of leather found on him. This is the note - (looking at it).</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I went to the grocer's for the tea and semolina, I did not conceive I had a right to put my name on the note, but thought I might put any other as well as my own; I did not know that was a breach of the law - I did not know it was forged. He said he would compare it with another - I asked him where the deficiency was? he shewed me, and held them both in his hand; I could have taken them both from him if I had been inclined. Does it appear likely that I should stand close to the door. and not have run away rather than subject myself to a prison. He said he would go with me - I knew I had given a false address, and did not like to go with him. I did not attempt to run - he says he thought I was going to run; if I had wished to run he could not have detained me, for the men would not assist him. When we returned to the shop it was full of people. I sat down - he shewed the note to a gentleman, and said he would give me in charge. I thought rather than go to prison, as I had formed a dreadful idea of a prison - to avoid it I snatched the note, and thought I had a right to destroy it as it was my own. I never had a Bank note in my life but what cost me 20 s., or labour to that amount. I have no connexion with men who traffic in notes, though I have been locked up fourteen days with men who boast of their robberies. They use every means to get notes into the hands of unwary persons - if I have been so unfortunate I cannot help it. One morning I met a man, and sold the two coats for 1 l., he went with me to Field-lane; when we came to Furnival's Inn, he said,</p>
               <p>"There is a man I know, you had better sell them to him," which I did - I expected him here. It appears to me that he and the man are connected - his name is

            . I am a porter, and live in King-street, Drury-lane. On Monday morning, the 1st of November, about four o'olock, I was coming up Ludgate-hill - it was dark. I came by the church, and perceived the prisoner standing at the door, which was open; he was alone. I cast my eye upon him, passed on six or eight yards, and then thought proper to turn back; he was then coming over the iron gate, which is outside the door - the gate was fastened. As soon as he jumped down, he stumbled, and I laid hold of him; two large brass knobs fell from him, on the pavement, and I picked them up. He had a good many things in his pockets and hat.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were put together did they make any brass ornaments - A. Yes, my Lord; he cried out to me to let him go. I said I would not, and called Walker, the watchman, who assisted in securing him. We took him to the watch-house, and I left him there with the articles - he was quite a stranger to me.</p>

            . I am watchman of Ludgate-hill. On the morning of the 1st of November, I was crying four o'clock down Pilgrim-street, nearly opposite the church - it was quite dark. The man cried,</p>

               <p>"Watch!" I went across, and laid hold of the prisoner, whom Huggard was holding, close by the iron gate of the church - the iron gate was locked. I took him to the watch-house, and the constable took him to the Compter. I saw Harris take a green bag with a bottle in it, some matches, some brass work, three keys, a screw-driver, and a chisel were also found in it. Some brass was found in his breeches, waistcoat, and coat-pockets.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. Martin, Ludgate. I was in the church on the 31st of October, until about twenty minutes after four o'clock in the afternoon. I was not the last person there; I bolted the doors myself, and always do, but the sexton locks them after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any service performed after that time - A. No, my Lord. Nobody had any business there afterwards - when I left, the ornaments of the church, and the candle branches were all in their proper places. I left them safe. The iron gates were double locked, and are about four feet from the ground. About a quarter after four o'clock the next morning the watchman called me up - I live in Creed-lane. I went over to the church, and found the door open - it did not appear to have been forced. I unlocked the gate, and went in.</p>
               <p>Q. How had the persons got entry into the church? Had the lock been picked - A. No. My opinion is, that it must have been done by some person, who had concealed himself inside. No person could by any means, have entered from without; when I got to the porch, I found the door open, and the bolts drawn. I missed six brass knobs belonging to the churchwardens' pew, which were in their proper state before, and two more from the organ loft, worth about 18 s. I also missed two candle branches from the reader's, and two from the clerk's desk. I found the knobs and candle branches at the watch-house, which I am sure belong to the church. The candle branches were worth 10 s.</p>

            . I am constable of Farringdon Ward. I was at the watch-house when the prisoner was brought in, and assisted him in unloading himself from the heavier brass. He was loaded with candle branches and knobs in his different pockets. The heaviest were brought in by the watchman. I took him to the Compter, then found the brass work, seven keys, a handle with two beds to fit in the screw-driver, and a chisel. On searching the church, I found a saw answering to them. I found a box, which produces instantaneous light, a bottle of vitriol, and some matches; also a small hand-vice, a long chisel, a broken spike-bit, and a pen-knife, He said he had secreted himself there, for he was much distressed, and did not know what to do.</p>

             re-examined. I know Mr. Patten's name is William.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord, it is the first time during my life, of twenty-eight years, that I have had the painful task of standing before a Judge and Jury. My situation is more distressing, having been brought up in a religious way, and having a mother now far advanced in years, who at present is unacquainted with my melancholy situation; she must know it, and I fear it will break her heart. I have likewise a wife and child who are ignorant of it. About five years ago I engaged in business at Bristol with 15000 l., and through the distress of the times, in four years I was under the necessity of calling my creditors together, and paid them 15 s. in the pound. I came to town for a situation, and remained out of one for some time, but at last engaged with Mr. Thompson, who is an ironmonger in Oxford-street. I was trusted with considerable sums of money, and the keys of the till, but many of my creditors not being satisfied with the dividends, applied to me for more, which produced a dispute between Mr. Thompson and me, and occasioned me not to do my duty to him as I ought. He was satisfied with my honesty, and will speak to my character. If any mercy can be shewn me, I hope this will be taken into consideration.</p>

I missed my watch, and immediately followed, and secured him; he made a shuffle, upon which some girls came up, and scratched and kicked me - they hurt me very much, and rescued him, but I never lost sight of him. A witness laid hold of him; I have not found my watch - the women went away. He said at the watch-house that he would mark me, and said he had never seen me. When he laid hold of me I thought he was drunk.</p>

            . I am a brazier, and live in Paul's-alley, Cripplegate. On the 13th of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I was going up Golden-lane, heard the cry of Stop thief! went up the court, and the prosecutor said he had been robbed of his watch by the prisoner - two women were trying to rescue him from the prosecutor. As I took him down Golden-lane to have him searched, one of the women said,</p>
               <p>"Come home, he is no officer. You shan't take my husband." I shoved the woman away from him; he got from the prosecutor, and I secured him before he got out of my sight - we took him to the watch-house; he said there that he would mark the prosecutor. The women appeared to be loose women - they never came again.</p>

On the 12th of November, about twelve o'clock in the morning, as I was sitting in the counting-house, which is about twelve yards from the door, a person opened the warehouse door, and I heard the bell ring; I saw a boy's face, he offered apples to sell; I said I wanted none - nobody was in the warehouse. He pressed me to buy some, but I gave him a sharp denial, and he went away immediately. Next day a person brought a piece of cotton to me, and I then missed it - it has my private mark on it, and contains twenty-eight yards. I do not know that the prisoner is the boy.</p>

I am a constable, On the 12th of November, about twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner alone in Little Bell-alley, London-wall - he had nothing with him then that I could see; I knew him. He saw me looking at him, and instantly ran away - he knew I was a constable before. I went across Moorfields after him, took him at the corner of Catherine-wheel-alley, and told him that I believed him to be a thief. At that time he had a rough great coat on, and the piece of printed cotton buttoned up under his coat. I went to different warehouses, and found the prosecutor, who claimed it. The prisoner said he picked it up in Moorfields.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Clark, Boyd and Co. I was going up Cow-lane between five and six o'clock in the evening, and was met by a gang of about ten persons - I was robbed of my watch by three of them; they then proceeded towards Holborn, I followed them, and when they got to the bottom of Snow-hill I heard a cry of Stop thief! saw the prisoners running in the middle of the road, and assisted in securing him. He resisted, but when he found people round he surrendered. Knight charged him with the robbery, he denied it.</p>

On the 30th of October, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, as we were shutting up, the prisoner came in with another woman, and had a quartern of rum - they drank it out of a measure at the bar; some pots stood on the counter within their reach; I left the bar for a moment, on my return I observed them watching me very attentively. I suspected them, and observed the other had a hand concealed under her cloak - they both had large cloaks. I left my sister in the bar, and went round to the front door; they came out, I followed them into St. John's-court, they secreted themselves behind a waggon, watched sometime there, and went down an entrance into West-street. I told the watchman I suspected they had stolen a pot, he followed, asked them for it, and found it under the prisoner's cloak. They said, as we had got the pot we ought to let them go. The other was discharged.</p>

I was asked again, and gave the same answer. When I came nearly opposite Wellington-street the officer produced a handkerchief, and begged I would look at it in a shop - it was mine, and was in my pocket when I left home. I found the prisoners in custody.</p>

On the 25th of November I was in the Strand, about six o'clock in the evening, and saw the two prisoners, in company with another, at the end of a court in the narrow part of the Strand; I went into a passage opposite to watch them, Mr. Harrison came in a direction towards the City, and passed the court where they stood, immediately all three came out, and followed him closely. I saw Goldie put his hand into Mr. Harrison's pocket, the other two covering him - he took a hankerchief out, and gave it to Oram. I immediately seized them. Read, who was with me, took Oram, and charged him with having the handkerchief; he said he had just picked it up - at first he denied having it. Read took the other. I sent a watchman after Mr. Harrison. I then went up to him myself, and he claimed the handkerchief.</p>

            . I was with Thompson, and saw the prisoners, with a third person, in the court, they followed Mr. Harrison. I saw Goldie go between them - the others covered him - Thompson was nearer than me; I could not see what they did. I laid hold of Oram, the other two ran away. I seized Goldie about fifty yards off - I never lost sight of him.</p>
               <p>GOLDIE'S Defence. I saw a mob, ran across the road; they collared me, and took me into a shop. The gentleman cannot say whether he dropped it or not. The officer said there were four of us in company.</p>
               <p>ORAM'S Defence. I was coming along the Strand, in the scuffle I picked up a handkerchief, and put into my my pocket. I stood still to see who had lost it.</p>

I never saw him in the bar; only my wife and I had access to the till. The pocket-book contained about 54 l.; there was one 10 l., six 5 l., and ten 1 l. notes. I missed it about half-past eleven or twelve o'clock, when I went to bed. The prisoner had come to the house about half-past nine o'clock in the morning, and stopped till half-past twelve o'clock. He did not come afterwards I believe. I have recovered some of the notes. On the Saturday following I went to a public-house in Essex-street, where he lodged, and saw him sitting in the parlour, talking to some friends. I shut the parlour door, called Edwards and Baker; I turned round and saw him run from the parlour towards the cellar. The officers came in.</p>

            . I live at the Crown, public-house, Essex-street. The prisoner lodged about eight weeks at my father's house. On Saturday the 30th October, the officers came; the prisoner was in the parlour. I saw him run from the parlour across the yard to the cellar, to the place where the notes were afterwards found; he was not there more than a minute, and returned shortly; the officers came in in two minutes and took him. The property was found on the Monday following. I saw them come in with a light, and go down to where the prisoner had been.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the yard enclosed where the cellar is? - A. It is, and belongs to my father's premises only; persons could not get to it without going through our house.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 30th of October, I went with the prosecutor and Edwards to the Crown, public-house, and met the prisoner coming out of the yard, took hold of him, and said I wanted him for Mr. Gasson's felony; he seemed agitated. I got a light and went down to the privy. On the Monday I went there again, took a light, and in the cellar, by the right-hand side of the water-closet, on a beam, I found a bundle of Bank notes, which I produce. I showed them to the prosecutor, and he claimed them.</p>

             re-examined. The notes are mine. Here is a 5 l. note which I took of a gentleman's servant that morning. They all have my name on them, and were in the pocket-book when it was stolen; it contained about 57 l., here is 27 l.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. At the examination you said you lost them between eleven and twelve o'clock, and then said you did not miss them till between five and six o'clock in the evening - A. No; I said I missed them about twelve o'clock at night, but must have lost them about one, as I had then locked the till, and it was not unlocked till I went to bed. I concluded it must have been taken before I locked the till.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it. I was in the habit of going to his house; I was there on the Sunday; almost as soon as I came in his wife gave me the baby to mind. I nursed it till about one o'clock, then went home to dinner, and did not go there again. I was there on Monday morning; I was ill in my bowels, and had a glass of white wine. I was there on the Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Friday I was ill, and kept at home. On Saturday I was taken as I was going to the vault. There are thirteen lodgers in the house who have access to it.</p>

On the 12th of November the prisoner, Jones, pledged a watch for 12 s., in the name of Davis - I did not know him before, but am certain he is the person. I described him to the officer; the officer brought him to me to know if he was the man - he said he did not pawn it. I afterwards heard him say a man, who appeared to be a butcher, gave him 2 s. to pawn it.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's brother, and was with him at the time. Three young men came out of Mitchell-street, Ellis pushed him into the middle of the road - I had seen him several times before; he was up and down Whitecross-street several times every day - I am sure he is the person. He pushed him into the road, I followed them - they hustled him about - he missed his watch. We pursued, but it was useless.</p>

            . I am a constable of Worship-street. In consequence of information Aston gave me, I apprehended Jones, on the 18th of October, in Whitecross-street. I said I took him on suspicion of being concerned in the robbery of a watch, he said he knew nothing about it. I took him to Aston, he said he was the man. He told the Magistrate a butcher gave him 2 s. to pledge it. Three nights afterwards I stopped Ellis; they were brought up together two days after, and the prosecutor identified Ellis.</p>

On Saturday night, the 27th of November, I went to bed with my wife about half-past nine o'clock, I made the house perfectly secure, and about a quarter after ten I heard the latch of the middle-room door move, as if some one attempted to open it. The house is all on one floor; my shop is behind the two rooms, before which is the parlour and sleeping-room. I laid still, and heard a noise, as if some one was feeling their way in the passage - I whispered to my wife, but she was asleep. A chair stood in the middle of the room adjoining the bed-room; this obstructed his passage, and knocked against the door, which awoke my wife. She said,</p>
               <p>"What is that! get up." Any one must have heard us. I got off the bedstead, and at that time the person knocked down a three-legged stool, on which laid some iron and steel, that awoke one of the children. I opened the door, got the poker, and as soon as I got into the workshop he was gone. I found the window and door open, and the lathe broken down. He must have trod on the lathe to get out of the window. I went to the front door, but saw no one. I went in again, struck a light in the bed-room, and heard some persons talking in front. I went to the door and saw Birch - the prisoner was in custody of a watchman. I dressed myself, and went to the watch-house with them. The prisoner said,</p>
               <p>"You have lost nothing, have you?" I said No. He said,</p>
               <p>"You did not see me in your house" - I said No, and asked him how he could have entered the house? he said</p>
               <p>"I was in the garden, I acknowledge, but I was not in your house." I said if he had been in the garden he had been in the house. I went into a field by the side of the gardens; Birch pointed to a place in the fence - we traced footmarks from there to where he escaped. It was a frosty night - one footmark was black and the other white. I knew what made the black one, because in getting out over the lathe he had put his foot on some charcoal dust. I am positive the person in the gardens must have been in the house, as the footmarks were directly from the fence to the window, and back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you observe whether they were the footmarks of more than one person - A. Only one person, from and to the window - it appeared he had got in at the window. It is a casement window, and I am certain it was shut, and quite safe when I went to bed. I tried to open it myself without any thing, and could not.</p>

            . I am Sergeant at Mace of the City, and live within three doors of Read - my house is down a passage behind his. About ten o'clock at night I was going home, and saw three men, whom I suspected, close to Read's premises. I went home then, returned to fetch some porter, and saw them again standing by his premises. They saw me, and turned to the railings, as if for a necessary purpose. As I returned with my porter, two of them came towards me, and went swiftly by me. I said,</p>
               <p>"You are after no good; if the watchman was here I would give you in charge." I turned my head, and saw the prisoner jump out of the prosecutor's garden into a field, then into a gentleman's garden, and into the passage where I took him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010043"/>Q. How near was he to Read's window when you first saw him - A. About six yards. I saw him get over the palings, which are seven feet high. I lost sight of him, and found him secreted under a corner. My dog barked, my wife opened the door, called me, and I took him. He said he had mistaken his way, and he thought it was a thoroughfare. I told him he must have known it was not, for my gate was locked when I went out, and I found it locked when I returned. At the watch-house he said to Read,</p>
               <p>"When you go home examine if you have lost any thing." He said the other two had been playing with him, and had thrown his hat over. I saw the footsteps, and traced a person plainly to and from the house. It was a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I and two lads had been to see the Canal - I stopped for a necessary purpose - one of them threw my hat over the pales; they called out</p>
               <p>"Stop him!" as I got over the pales - the man knocked me down for it, and said he would knock his pistol down my throat if he had it; I said I came with no bad intent.</p>

The prisoner came into the Bush, public-house, at Farnham, and asked for a bed; I had stopped there for refreshment as I returned home; they objected to let him have the bed, and said they never took servants in without their masters were with them. He went down the town, and I drove away. I rode to the end of the town outside; he jumped up behind at the end of the town, and rode about a mile - I did not object to it. I then took two men up to take to Faruborough, he then came in front of the chaise, and said he would give me 1 s. 6 d. to take him to the White Hart, public-house, at Bagshot; he got in with the other two men. I drove to the Tumbledown Dick, public-house, at Farnborough; the two men got out, and I rode on with the prisoner. I asked him for the fare; he said he would not pay me till he got to the White Hart. I drove on with him; I was outside when I came to Rushey Bottom, which is two miles and a half from Bagshot; he let down the blinds and said</p>
               <p>"Stop! let me out." I said,</p>
               <p>"I was going to stop a little farther on;" he jumped out, caught hold of the horse's head, stopped them, told me to get off the dickey, and said</p>
               <p>"Deliver your money or I will have your life." He presented a brace of pistols at my head. I delivered him three shillings and three sixpences, one was a crooked one. I said he might have the silver if he would let me have my purse. He kept the pistols at my head, and said he would blow my brains out. I gave him the purse; he said,</p>
               <p>"Now I want that horse, take it out of the chaise, and put the saddle on;" I did so. He said,</p>
               <p>"Give me the whip out;" I did so; the horse kept kicking; I gave him my short whip, and he mounted the horse and rode off. As he was going off he turned round; I got into the chaise after the whip; he put the pistols in at the window, but said nothing. I drove on to a little house with one horse, and left the chaise with a man. The coach came by; the guard jumped on my other horse and rode after him; he was apprehended at Turnham-green. I found my master's horse, bridle, saddle, and my whip there. I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. I had no pistols; are you sure of that - A. Yes; he presented them to my head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I snap them at you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I took the horse, but I took no money of you - A. Yes, you took three shillings and three sixpences.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was coming from home, and heard a piece of work between the prisoner and another at Turnham-green; he said he had not stolen a horse; I caught hold of his horse; he dismounted and then went into the Packhorse, public-house. He went through the passage into the yard, climbed over the wall into a common, and then into a field. I kept looking after him about the privy and places, but could not find him; the people said he had scaled the wall. I got a horse, went after him, and caught him in the field about half a mile from the Packhorse. I believe the other man took the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. That person was the guard - A. He was on the other horse. I brought the prisoner back to the Packhorse.</p>

            . I am a constable of Kensington. I was sent for to the Packhorse, public-house, and took the prisoner into custody. I found about a quarter of a pound of gunpowder, some shot, and two pieces of black crape on him, but no pistols. I also found one crooked and one bad sixpence on him, which the prosecutor says are his. I have brought the horse to the New Inn; I was present when Walker saw and claimed it. A whip was given to me. I asked him how he could do such a thing? he appeared careless about it.</p>

On the 10th of September I went out about eight o'clock at night, and made the house secure. It was dark then. I returned between eleven and twelve o'clock; I found the window open, the garden-pots taken down from the window, and the cups and saucers moved from one part of the table to the other; I missed the articles stated in the indictment; part of the clothes-line was cut from the garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before - A. I spoke to him about three weeks before - that is all. On the 29th of October I went with Attfield to the prisoner's room, and under his bed, sewed up in a bundle, I found the coat. He had let me two rooms in the same house with him. I had lived there seven weeks before I found the goods.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. What led you to search his bed after being seven weeks in his house - A. I missed other property.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Q. Did you not sleep with me - A. Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Trapp who robbed the Post Office - A. Yes; I knew him about seven weeks before he was convicted, in consequence of a cousin of mine who was in the Post Office.

            . I am an officer. I went with Pitcher to the prisoner's house on the 29th of October, to search for other property, and found four or five old sheets sewed together, and a coat in them. The prosecutor said that is the coat that was taken from my house in Richard-street. I also found two pieces of clothes line, which he said were taken at the same time. I found neither the carpet or bed. The prisoner stated these things before the Magistrate which he has now done. The Magistrate committed him from day to day to bring evidence, and offered him any one to go any where for him; he brought nobody forward.</p>

            . I am beadle of St. George's. On the 27th of November, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner with the flannel under his arm. I suspected him, stopped him, and asked him where he bought it? He said at a shop in the Commercial-road - he could not tell me what shop. I took him to the watch-house, and he there said he bought it of a man in the road for 14 s., and said he did not know how many yards there were for he bought it in the lump. I found it belonged to Mr. Minton.</p>

            . I was the prosecutor's carman; I left the reins in the cart in the yard when I had done work - I and all the men left the yard together, leaving the prisoner behind. Next morning I missed the reins; - I ought to have put them into the stable. I asked the prisoner if he knew any thing about them? He said he did not, and told me to hold my tongue, for somebody had hid them, and they would be found; after that the prisoner and I had a dispute about putting some casks into a cart, which were too heavy for me - I said I would not do it. He was angry, and went and told my master that I had lost the reins. Next morning Mr. Mornay asked me about them, and I said I dare say the puppy had dragged them away - 8 s. was stopped out of my wages for them, but I applied to the Magistrate, and it was paid to me - I was discharged. On the 28th of October, I was at my father's, and saw the prisoner drive his cart by; I knew the reins on the horses by the girt buckle - I went out, examined them, and knew them. I told my father, then went to the collar maker, and he said they were the reins. I went with somebody after him to Bethnal Green, found him there unloading his goods, and asked him to deliver up to me Mr. Mornay's reins. He said he had none, and ran away with the cart. He said they were not Mornay's, for he had bought them at Mr. Blacket's sale. He afterwards said that he bought them of a man in a long brimmed hat.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Ann's. Hopson and Bass came to me on the 28th of October, and I followed the prisoner to Church-street, Bethnal Green, where he was unloading his cart of household goods. Bass went and asked the prisoner for the reins; he took them in his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010045"/>hand, and said he bought them at Blacket's sale - he said Bromley and Ward sold them. I took him in charge, and as we went by Bromley and Ward's he turned in there. The clerk examined the books, and found that no reins had been sold. He then said he bought them of a man in a long brimmed hat, the next day, when he went to fetch his goods, the gentleman said if he would say what goods he had bought, he could perhaps find the man out. He then said that he did not know that he had bought any. He at first said he gave 3 s. for them, and then 4 s.</p>

On the 3d of November, about ten o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came, asked to see a piece of dressed leather, and bought a small quantity. We have some drawers of leather on the opposite side. I had two or three customers in front of the counter, he was at the drawer, helping himself. What he bought came to 13 d., he paid 7 d., said he had no more, and that he would call for it - he went away. As soon as he shut the door I opened it; he ran off as hard as he could. I followed, caught him, and found thirteen pieces of leather between his trowsers and shirt; they where all marked.</p>

We went up stairs, and opened his trunk - nothing was there; we went to a second, there was a shawl and a piece of calico. Seeing the shawl I went to lay hold of it, he snatched it out of my hand, threw the piece of calico on the bed, and asked if the calico was my property? During the time I was examining it, he

               <p>"Whose property is that now, Sir?" I sent for a constable, who took him away, and returned with his keys. We searched his boxes, and found sixty-seven duplicates, one of which related to the cambric; I have since seen it, it has my private mark on it - I had not missed it, as I had not taken stock after Christmas.</p>

On the 5th of November, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the elder prisoner open the desk, and take something out - money was kept there; the other prisoner was not in the room. I immediately called the elder prisoner from the warehouse, where the desk was, into the counting-house, and charged him with taking silver from the desk, which he most positively denied, and said he was willing to be searched, which was done. No silver was found on him, but four halfpence, which I knew to be the prosecutor's, as I had marked them about eleven o'clock the night previous, and put them into the desk - it is always left unlocked; there was still 3 s. missing. We found a half-crown and a sixpence on the younger prisoner five or ten minutes after - the elder prisoner is his father.</p>

I took a bag out of his jacket pocket, containing a quantity of bar silver.

I was in King-street as the procession was passing; I saw the prisoner, with two other lads - I saw him with his arm between two gentlemen who stood together, one of whom was the prosecutor - he appeared to have his arm round Mr. Easto's body; he turned his head, and spoke to the two lads, they immediately closed and hid him from my view. I stepped forward, and the moment I came up I saw a silk handkerchief in the prisoner's hand, he was handing it to one of the other two. I seized him and one of the lads - the lad, I think, threw the handkerchief on the pavement. I told Mr. Easto, he claimed it. The lad got away as I stopped to pick it up, but I kept hold of the prisoner.</p>

I looked among the carriages and found the door of one open, and both the glasses gone - the strings were left hanging to the door; they were safe at eight o'clock the night before. Next morning I heard two glasses had been stopped at Covent-garden watch-house. I went there, took the strings with me, and found they matched the part left on the carriage, they were my masters' property. The prisoner was in custody. The padlocks were wrenched off.

Elliot, who slept in the shop, said he had found the shop door wide open, and that he had lost property. I said it was very strange. Nothing passed till the Tuesday following, which was the 17th of November. When the Excise officers came they asked if I had heard of a box of candles which was at Marlborough-street? I found the box and candles at Mr. Pain's, in Tom's-court, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square, and knew them to be mine by the hand-writing on the box, in chalk. Mr. Pain said it was left there some time before by a man who was to call for it again, but that he did not call.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Mr. Pain is a stranger to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JAMES PAIN. I am a shoemaker, and live in Tom's-court, Duke-street, Grosvenor-square. On the 24th of October, about eight o'clock in the morning, my wife went into the yard; she came in and said there was a box in the yard which appeared to be a tallow-chandler's box - my boy went into the yard and brought it in. I untied the cord and opened it, and found it full of candles. Just as got it open a boy came and said he knew who it belonged to. I kept the box. I then went to two tallow-chandlers, but could not find the owner. About a quarter before eleven o'clock that morning, which was Sunday, the prisoner came to my house, opened the door, went into the yard, and then went up stairs. I do not know which room he went into. He came down, knocked at my door, and asked if I had not got a box which was left in the yard? I said I had, and asked if it belonged to him? He said Yes. I asked him how he came to put it in my yard, for I might be taken up for receiving stolen goods? He said nothing particular. I said,</p>
               <p>"Young man, give me your name and address, and if it is all right you shall have the box." He said he lived at No. 71, Lower Sloane-street, Chelsea. I told him I would go and see. I went and found it was a private house. They said they had no lodgers. I went to different tallow-chandlers, but could not find the owner. They said they would make it known in the trade. On the 16th of November the prosecutor saw the box at my house, he and his man claimed it. I am sure the prisoner is the man who came for it. He acknowledged it himself when the constable took him, and said the young man who slept in the shop gave it him to take out.</p>

I did not give the prisoner the box.</p>

I lost a 1 l. note before that. I sleep close by the door at the end of the counter. The box of candles were in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. You was charged with the robbery yourself - A. Yes, and lost my place through it. I had not seen the prisoner for six weeks before. I have lost the use of my right ear, and if I lay on my left I do not hear.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other residence - A. I boarded at the prisoner's brother's, in Bird-street, Manchester-square. I keep my things at my master's, and live with my master now. I have got my place again.</p>

            . We live at Numbers 10 and 11, Cockspur-street; the prisoner was in our service; he had 35 l. a-year at first, and then 40 l., and boarded in the house. He came in April, 1817, and left us on the 9th of December, 1818, and went into the employ of Davis and Cook.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any cambric - A. No, our concern is very large. On the 8th of November Davis and Cook sent for me. A pawnbroker's duplicate was produced, which led me to Lightfoot's, where I found a piece of cambric with my private mark on it. I never authorized him to take it. He never bought a piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Do you never sell cambric with a private mark on it - A. Yes; I never sold him any; my partners may for what I know. It was not found for nine months after he left.</p>

            . On Saturday, the 13th of November, about twelve o'clock at night, as I was coming along the Strand, towards Vine-street, the prisoner, Barker, persuaded me to go with her into a parlour in <placeName id="t18191201-99-crimeloc572">Vine-street, Chandos-street</placeName>

She then cried out Murder! in the room - she had locked the room door, and in a few minutes the other prisoners forced the door open; as soon as Howard got into the room, he struck me a blow on my mouth, which loosened one of my teeth. I fell on my knees from the blow, and Miller struck me on the head - I fell, it cut my hat. Howard put one of his hands into my breeches pocket, then Miller and 
               <persName id="t18191201-99-person1090">Howard</persName>
             both struck me, and the women assisted in holding me while they robbed me of my money. Howard took the money out of my pocket - they took 18 s. in silver. I cried out for assistance to the watchman, who forced the street door open, and came in - as soon as he forced the door open the prisoners all ran up two pair of stairs. I ran up with the watchman, and gave them all in charge; they took a handkerchief from my neck and one from my pocket - they took them by force - I am sure it was all the prisoners; Smith and Campbell were more active than the woman who took me in.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 14th of November, about one o'clock in the morning, I was at the corner of Chandos-street, St. Martin's-lane, and heard a rattle spring at the corner of Vine-street. I went into Vine-street. I heard the cry of Murder! I got close to the door, and called to them to open it; there was no answer. I forced it open and got inside. The prosecutor came up with his lip cut, and said he had been struck, knocked down, and robbed of some money and his handkerchief off his neck and another handkerchief. I asked him where they were? he said they were gone up stairs. We put a watchman at the door. I went up stairs with the prosecutor and another watchman, and found all the prisoners up stairs in the two pair of stairs room, except Barker, who was at the top of the stairs. The prosecutor pointed the two men out, and said the women had assisted in robbing him. He said Howard first struck him, and Miller next.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say which woman he went in with - A. No, my Lord, I got more watchmen to assist me, and took all the five prisoners to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner MILLER. Q. When you came up, was I dressed or not - A. His coat was off - he had time to do that, for I was five or ten minutes at the door before I could get in.</p>

After one o'clock in the morning, I heard the cry of Murder! in the house, sprang my rattle, and placed the next watchman to me at the door, to let nobody in or out until I got assistance. I went into the house, and found the prosecutor, who told me they were gone up stairs. I went up with him, and met Barker at the top of the stairs all over wet - she was crying. I thought they had been ill-using her, as she was wet, and standing on the stairs. I took them all into custody.</p>

               <p>MILLER'S Defence. I lodged at this house. On Saturday night, the 13th of October, I received my wages, and was with my companions till near twelve o'clock; I got intoxicated, went home, and went to bed that instant - I never saw the prosecutor. I was roused out of my bed by hearing the noise. I never saw the other man till I got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>HOWARD'S Defence. I had received 25 s., and had a pint of beer. About a quarter after twelve o'clock I heard the cry down the street, and went into the house to see what was the matter. Some women were quarrelling on the stairs, covered with water - I told them not to pull each other about. While I was talking to them. the prosecutor came up with the watchman and gave us in charge - he gave the girls in charge for being disorderly.</p>
               <p>BARKER'S Defence. I was with some young women till half-past twelve o'clock at night up stairs. I live at No. 3; this is No. 5. Smith had been quarrelling with Campbell, and said she would have her spite of her. She forced the door open and struck her on the breast, and called watch. The watchman came up, and sent for the prosecutor, who said the men had robbed him of 18 s. and a handkerchief. He went to the watch-house and charged the men only with the robbery. No others<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010053"/>were mentioned, for he said he had been in company with Platt. On Monday he told the Magistrate I took him into the house.</p>
               <p>CAMPBELL'S Defence. I never saw the prosecutor there till he came into the room with the watchman.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I was going along Vine-street for a pot of beer; the man called after me. I said I was going for some beer. He followed me into the public-house, and drank the beer. I went to the door with him; he offered me 2 s. I said that was not sufficient. He said he had no more. He went into the parlour, and asked me to stop with him a few minutes for 2 s. 6 d., which I agreed to. I left him in a few minutes. I never saw him again till he came up with the watchman about an hour after. The watchman seeing me in a row said,</p>
               <p>"Go and fetch the baker; I dare say these are the men who have robbed him." We were taken to the watch-house. The constable of the night said,</p>
               <p>"Let the women go;" the watchman said,</p>
               <p>"No, I give them in charge for making a noise in the house." heard nothing about a handkerchief. It is an open house.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was on duty at the corner of Cursitor-street, about twelve o'clock, and heard a rattle spring, crossed the road by Lincoln's Inn Gate, and saw the prisoner jammed against the wall by a gentleman with an umbrella; I secured him, and the gentleman left. - I searched him but found nothing on him. I took him to the watch-house. I found the chain within about twelve yards from where I took the prisoner, by the railings at the back of Old-square,</p>

The prisoner and his wife lodged eight weeks with me in the back parlour, at 5 s. per week - these things were let with the lodgings; they came on the 11th of November. On the 19th I suspected all was not right, as I had not seen the prisoner for two days. I told his wife that I wished to see if all was right, but instead of taking me into the room she got out of the door, and ran away - I secured her, and gave her in charge. She then said all was not right, I went in and missed these things. She said her husband had taken them out about six o'clock that morning. I have not found them.</p>

I saw a man like the prisoner with a basket of tools at his back, hanging on an axe. He was about two hundred yards from the stable, where the tools were stolen from. I was going to Westminster, and as I returned I met Brummage and Stoat, who said they had lost their tools. I described the man to them, and sent them to Maybank, who, from that description, found him - nobody was with him.</p>

On searching the premises, I found an iron chisel, two rag-stones, and a quantity of other duplicates - one was for a pair of silver spoons.

He said he was apprenticed to Mr. Giles, the waterman, which proved to be wrong; he left the ship unknown to any one. I followed him to Shadwell, and with the assistance of his brother, I found him at a green stall. He said if we would both go with him, he would get the coat. He cried and said it was close by.</p>

On the 27th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my house, and had half a pint of beer in the parlour - a gentleman was in the parlour at the time. As soon as the gentleman left, not liking my customer, I went to see what he was about, and told him I wanted to shut up. He said he would not be more than a few minutes, and I returned to the bar. He came out apparently in a great hurry, and from his manner I thought he must have committed a robbery - I followed him out. When he thought he was out of sight, he stopped, and stooped down. I went up to him, and asked him if he had lost any thing? he said No. He was feeling about his trowsers. I said,</p>
               <p>"What have you got there?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Nothing at all" - I heard something jink inside, as if he had fetters on. The flap of his coat went aside, and there was the top of the tongs and shovel sticking out of his trowsers - the poker fell on the pavement, and I collared him. He begged to be let go - I gave him in charge</p>

I saw the prisoner close before me; I saw him plainly by the gas light - nobody else was near enough to have done it but him; he immediately ran up Crown-court. I pursued, but did not overtake him, and turned into Hanging Sword-alley. I missed him in an instant, and did not see him again that night. I turned back, and found there was a court leading to the river. On the Sunday following I went to the public-house at the corner of that court, to see if there was any door leading into that court, and while I was there the prisoner came out - I knew him instantly, and am certain he is the man who snatched my watch. I could distinguish his features very plainly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you secure him - A. No, my Lord, but I followed him across the road, and down Water-lane; he then turned up a court on the right side of the way, which goes into Bouverie-street - he went into a house in that court. He came out in about two minutes, and went into Bouverie-street; I still followed him close, and when he got to the open place he saw me, came up, and asked me why I followed him? I said,</p>
               <p>"I think I know you - I have seen you before. What is your name?" He said it was Dillon, and he could get a character; I did not wish him to know what I followed him for, and went away - he said something very impudent. I lost him for a short time, went into Fleet-street, and saw him coming up Water-lane - I did not take him then, as I was afraid. Next day I stated the case at the Mansion House, and Herdsfield apprehended him on the Wednesday. I have no doubt of his being the man, who snatched my watch.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You saw no person in particular but the prisoner - A. He came against my side, and took by watch. I did not look for him in the week.</p>

            . I am a constable. I had information of this robbery, and on the morning of the 1st of December, I saw the prisoner coming out of Mr. Mason's seed shop, in Fleet-street. I knew him before, took him as he crossed the street, and told him I wanted him for robbing a gentleman of his watch. He said he thought it very curious as the gentleman had seen him before, that he did not take him himself. As I was going down Ludgate-hill - I was walking by the side of him, but had not got hold of him, I saw the prosecutor, who immediately said,</p>
               <p>"That is the person, who robbed me of my watch" - I believe the prisoner said he must be mistaken. I found nothing particular on him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you tell him the gentleman had seen him since the watch was taken - A. I believe I did. He then said, if the gentleman saw me why did he not take me. I went to his house with him down a court in Water-lane; he lived there with his mother.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the Sunday after the robbery I was coming up Water-lane, and went into a public-house with two young men - I met the prosecutor as I came out, he took particular notice of me, and followed me to my door. I came out in a few minutes, and saw him at the corner. I asked him why he followed me? he said he was not following me, and wanted nothing of me - he went away. I walked about there. He said he knew nothing of me and left. I met him again at the top of Water-lane. On the Saturday night after he was robbed, I was coming up Crown-court, he was talking to some persons, and said he should call it the thieving court as long as he lived.</p>

She took hold of my arm, and kept hold of it till I had crossed the market, then two more girls came up, and asked me to go with them - the prisoner quitted my arm and came in front, the other two came, one on each side. The prisoner pulled my watch out, and ran up a dark court; I followed but lost her. I do not know what became of the other two - I think I saw one of them come down the court, but am not certain - this was on the Tuesday. On Friday I met her again about the same spot, and am quite sure she is the same person. I asked her for the watch she had taken from me on Tuesday; she said she had never seen me nor the watch. I said if she did not give it to me I would take her to the Compter. She still denied it, and I took her into custody. I was sober.</p>

            . I am a glazier, and live in Princes-street, Barbican; I am the prosecutor's uncle. He had come with me from Hertford, and was sober when he left my house. About a quarter past ten o'clock at night he returned, and said his watch was stolen. On Friday night I was with him, and saw the prisoner at the corner of Fleet-market. He went after her; I came up - he was eight or ten yards from her when he first saw her. She denied it, and I assisted in taking her to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The prosecutor stood at the corner. I do remember seeing him on the evening of the robbery. He was in liquor - two women who stood there knew him well.</p>

Anderson said he brought a letter from his master to Mr. Robinson - that name was over the door. Jones said he was out of place, and had accompanied him. Hitchin searched Anderson, and found a large crow-bar in his coat pocket - they were taken to the Compter. I there found inside Jones's trowsers, a crow-bar, five skeleton door keys, and four smaller ones. I returned from the Compter, went up immediately to Mr. Squires's chambers, which is on the third floor, and found the door broken in a number of places in the pannels and edge - it had been attempted to be broken open; the crow-bar, on being applied to the marks, corresponded. The chambers had not been entered. The lock had been attempted and injured; the laundress could not open it with the key.</p>

I searched Anderson, and found a crow-bar, a large empty bag in his pocket handkerchief, three keys, and a pen-knife - the keys are for drawers. I fitted the crow to the door, the marks tallied with several of the impressions. The centre pannel was nearly pushed out. I felt Jones down, felt something and told Lanceley to search him.

I discharged him; he asked me to give him a quarter's wages, which I did; at the same time he wished to go out at six o'clock; I gave him leave to do, and told him he must return by eleven o'clock. He said he could not, and would not come home that night. He came early in the morning. About a week afterwards he behaved impudent, and I discharged him. He left me on the 23d of November; he had sent his box away the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Mrs. Dolton's, where the prisoner lodged - A. I did about a week after, on missing some of cocoa. She lives in Colville-yard, Windmill-street, Haymarket. I there searched his box, which I had seen in my house, and understood it to be his - it was locked. I found a piece of sugar, weighing 7 lbs.; a paper bag of tea, weighing about 9 ounces; 2 1/2 lbs. of soap, and ten nutmegs. I knew them all to be my property. There is my name chalked on the sugar, and on the paper there is a piece of an East India catalogue under the blue paper which has my writing on it. The tea is gunpowder tea, and is the same quality as mine; I know the bag. I went in pursuit of the prisoner with the officer that day; we found him at Bell's, in the Haymarket. I told him I had lost this property, and wished him to shew me where his lodgings were. He said in Windmill-street. The officer asked him to go and shew us his box; he agreed at first, then hesitated, and said he did not see any reason why he should go. The officer said he should take him if he would not. We went out together, and as soon as he got out he ran as hard as he could. We pursued with several others - he was taken about a mile off. We took him to Bow-street. The officer searched him, and found two keys and two nutmegs in his pocket. The officer again asked him, where his lodgings were? He said,</p>
               <p>"Here!" We were then in a public-house. One of the keys opened his box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You would have sold the sugar with the mark on it - A. Yes. I did not see his box brought into my house. I never sold any thing to him. Another man slept in the room with the prisoner.</p>

            . I live in Colville-yard, Windmill-street. I pointed out the box to the prosecutor and the officer. I was not at home when it was brought to my house; I had not seen it before they came. Four men lodged in the room with the prisoner, and there were seven boxes. I never saw the prisoner go to the box.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to point out the box to the prosecutor and the officer - A. Because it was at the foot of the prisoner's bed.</p>

            . I am a constable. I went with Mr. Sparrow to the prisoner's lodgings. We met Mrs. Dolton at her own room door. In consequence of what passed between us we went to this box - it was locked. I took these things out. Before that I found two keys on the prisoner - one of them opened the box as well as any key could.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It was a common key - A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a headborough, and live at Bow. On the 27th of November, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the day, I stood at my door and saw the prisoners cross the road. I suspected and watched them by Mrs. Greenley's shop; when both returned, Green went in - Martin watched at the window; Green came out, and both went away together. I went into the shop, and then pursued and secured them at Bromley, both walking together. They had been out of my sight. Martin threw a parcel into a ditch, which I picked up - it was the frock and cotton. I found the cap in Green's pocket.</p>

On the 6th of December, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I went down the forecastle and saw the prisoner there. He turned his back, and asked me if one Mr. Walker was in the ship? I said no such person belonged to the ship. The brig was moored close in shore, and there was a plank from the shore to her. I collared him, brought him up the ladder, and called the mate, who came and took him from me. We found he had my jacket on under his own, and my trowsers also under his own. They were in my chest before - it was not locked. I gave him in charge.</p>

               <p>GEORGE MASTERS. I was employed to watch the place where the pump was concealed, which was behind a hay-rick in a meadow, about three hundred yards from where it was stolen. On Tuesday, about a quarter before five o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners and two other persons come in a cart; one get out of the cart, went to the place, returned to the cart, and then drove on. I followed and stopped it in less than five minutes. I found the prisoners in the cart with this pump and five other pumps - it weighed 100 lbs. I secured them.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WOOD. I am the prosecutor's servant. On the 19th of November I was concealed in the loft over where the prisoner worked, and saw him load himself with steel and iron. I was watching two hours; he only went out once. He kept on working, loaded himself, and went out about a quarter after seven o'clock. I got down, ran round to the front and stopped him opposite Newton-street, Holborn. I brought him back. When he got about half way, he said,</p>
               <p>"For God's sake don't take me." I had not told him what I took him for. I collared him and took him to the counting-house. Mr. Furdon and I took him to the watch-house. He was searched there, and the steel and iron found on him; they were all my master's property, and what he loaded himself with. He made the pieces of iron hot, threw them in the water, and then put it about him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I was sent to inquire about the property. In consequence of information I went towards Hatchett's house, in High-street, Kensington, on Tuesday, the 23d of November, with Chester, the waiter at the hotel. In the way we met

She said, No. I asked her again - she denied it a second time. I then asked her who she had been to at Bromptom? I said I must know the person's name. She refused to tell. I took her into custody, and took her to her son Mitchell's. Before we got there she acknowledged she had been to him. She went to the door, and entered the house. She first went up stairs, and met

He said it was. I asked for his wife? He said she was out, and he did not know when she would return. I asked him if he had been that day to Mr. Kimber's, the pawnbroker, at Knightsbridge? He said he had not, and never was there in his life. I said that was not true, and I must search him, which I did, and found nothing about him. I proceeded to search the room, and on my putting my hand upon a tin box which was on the mantle-piece, he made a snatch at it, and said there were notes in it. There was some little confusion, and on his endeavouring to get it from me the candle was knocked out. I procured another light. While I was examing the contents he escaped out of the room - it is a narrow staircase. I pursued him; he threw a garden-pot off the window, which fell between him and me. I fell over it - he got out and shut the door; I could not get out.</p>

She opened the door when I knocked. I asked her where her husband was? She said he was not at home. On my looking round the room she burst out crying, and said,</p>
               <p>"I know what you are come for - the things are all here, they were brought here by my father and mother this morning before it was well light" (pointing to a large chest and bundle). The sheets on the bed were marked</p>
               <p>"E. S." I asked if they were her's? She said,</p>
               <p>"No, they are your's, they were brought here by my mother." Chester was with me I found several napkins and towels, with the same initials. She said they were not her's, but were brought by her mother. Chester looked round the room, and found a quantity of earthenware corresponding with the other. She said,</p>
               <p>"That is your's too, they were brought by my mother, with the exception of one dish." There was a tin candlestick there.</p>

               <p>"E. S.", and four without marks; thirty-four table-cloths, twenty-four marked</p>

               <p>"E. S."; six blankets, four of them marked. There were seventy ends of sheets cut off, most of them marked</p>
               <p>"Hatchett's Hotel;" fifteen ends of towels, some of them marked; six pieces of stair-carpet, seventeen dishes, twenty-nine plates, a cup and saucer, twenty-four knives, and eight forks, all of which Chester claimed. I asked her again where her husband was? She said he was afraid to sleep at home, for fear he should be apprehended; at last she told me where to find him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, in consequence of her information, go to No. 15, Gray's-buildings, Duke-street, Manchester-square - A, Yes, about one o'clock at night, and found Alderson in bed there. I awoke him, and asked his name? After a little time he said it was Alderson. I asked if that was his lodgings? He said Yes. I said, Have you any other lodging? He said No - that he always slept there, and was not married. I asked him if he had any lodgings at No. 6, Cumberland-street, Chelsea? He said No, he did not know it. I then said,</p>

               <p>"You have a lodging there, and are married. I have found a great deal of stolen property in your room, and you must dress yourself and go with me to account how you came by it." He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, that is the truth; I have a lodging there, and live with a woman named Swatman. I know the property you mention was there - it was brought by her father and mother this morning before it was well light; they knocked at the window; I got up and helped them in with it. I am sorry I did not tell you the truth, but my reasons for leaving the lodgings was, I thought if you came and found me and the things there I should be apprehended." I put him in the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you proceed anywhere else - A. About three o'clock, Chester, Whales, and I went to Mitchell's mother's house, in King's Road, World's End, Chelsea. Whales placed himself at the back of the house to prevent an escape, and I knocked at the door; the mother looked out, and I told her my business, but she refused to come down and let me in. I then said I must break in. I heard a noise at the back, got over the rails, and found Mitchell in the custody of Whales - we took him into the house through the window. He then wished very much to be forgiven, and said he had told me what was not true, and that he had been that evening to Kimber's, the pawnbroker - she also said,</p>
               <p>"You found other property of Mr. Hatchett's in my room, and all I have pledged, and all you found there, was brought by my wife's mother." His wife,

               <p>"Father, it is no use denying it." I put him into a separate watch-house from them, and the next morning on my fetching him to the office, I told him what I had found at his daughter, Alderson's, in Cumberland-street. He said,</p>
               <p>"It is no use my denying it any longer. I did help to take the things there, but did not know what they were." I said,</p>

               <p>"Don't mention that, you shall never take my daughter into bare walls." I thought she meant to furnish a place, agreed to marry her, and took a house next door to Mrs. Swatman's, for her to put the articles in - I thought it was improper to ask her where she got them. I took the things as a present. We were then married, and at different times various other things were brought, which I thought was to set us decently in order - this is how I came by the things. I call the Omnipotent to witness that I did not know they were stolen. I took their boy, to learn him to read and write to prevent him from wandering about the streets, and the mother said all the broken victuals that she got from Mr. Hatchett's should be sent for him. It came at different times wrapped in table-cloths.</p>

            'S Defence. On Saturday fortnight, between five and six o'clock in the morning, a knock came at my window - it was Mrs. Swatman. I went to the door, and Mr. and Mrs. Swatman stood there with a large chest. I asked what was the matter? She said,</p>
               <p>"We are going to move, let me put this in your passage" - they took it into the parlour, and said they would fetch it. I went to work. In the course of the day I understood she brought two bundles, and begged of her daughter not to let me know. In the evening her daughter came to me, and said the things had been stolen, and they were all ruined. We went home, and they told us two gentlemen had been there - Esther said I had better sleep out. I took her advice, and slept at my father's. Just before Esther laid in, her mother sent the sheets and table-cloths.</p>

            . I am clerk to Messrs. Longman and Co. Todd's Johnson was under my care, at the warehouse in Shoemaker-row. I took stock in June, 1819; there was no deficiency then.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of what took place, was the stock of Johnson, and Robinson's Scripture Characters, taken in October - A. Yes; I then missed twenty complete copies of Todd's Johnson, with portraits and titles - fifteen copies complete, but wanting the portraits; and five more copies, wanting seven numbers and the portrait. There were two of Part II. and five of Part XI. wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. What was wanted of Robinson's Scripture Characters - A. Twelve copies complete, and four volumes unbound. It is my business to issue orders for the delivery of them. I had given orders for twenty-five of Parts VIII., X., and XI. - that was all; no order was given for any perfect copy. I gave no order for the delivery of Robinson's Scripture Characters.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the copies which the house deliver - A. Particularly; none were delivered without the particular portrait engraved by Holl.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you accompany 
               <persName id="t18191201-126-person1340">Harrison</persName>
             any where - A. Yes, on the 23d of October we went to Brooks's house; he was not at home - he came home while we there. Harrison, the officer, asked him where he obtained the copies of Johnson which he had been selling? he said he had them from a respectable tradesman, and then said he had them from a respectable housekeeper - that did not satisfy the officer; he then said from Longman and Co. The officer told him the felony rested on his shoulder until he could remove it, for these gentlemen (pointing to me and Bamfield), come from Messrs. Longman's. He hesitated, and then said he had them from Mr. Broom, who kept the Goat's Head, in Cloth-fair. The officer said he must do his duty, and examine for the property. In the mean time I told Brooks I conceived he must be only the agent, and Broom the middle-man, and that I should be obliged if he would give me further information, and point out the person who stole the property. I said I considered he had been made a tool of. He said,</p>
               <p>"You know as well as I do." I said I should be sorry to name any person on suspicion, but I should be glad if he would name the party; he said, your own man did it. I said, do you mean

            ? he said, Yes, I do. I pressed him for further information, and he said Harrison was in it. Harrison, the prisoner, was not present. I and Harrison, the Marshal's man, then took him to the Goat; on arriving at the corner of Long-lane, we remembered that we could not identify Broom, and went back for Brooks to identify him; I saw Stewart, who had been our porter, coming out of Broom's door; I took hold of him by the elbow, and said,</p>
               <p>"William, have you been taking a glass of beer?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have been waiting at home, expecting you." We took him into the house with Brooks, and there found the prisoners Harrison and Broom; the Marshal's man put them all into the bar, and said he had called in consequence of their selling Johnson's dictionary - Harrison and Broom said they knew nothing about it. Harrison requested to go home to make some arrangements, I and Forrester accompanied him; we found some of our property there. We took him to Giltspur-street Compter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You told Brooks you considered him as an agent - A. I did; I considered him tool at that time. I believe he was employed in the sale and purchase of books in trifling way. Broom has dealt in books many years.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. What you mean by a tool is, that he was not employed in stealing the books, but in selling them - A. I did; I never saw Broom at our premises.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 19th of June you state every thing was safe - A. At Midsummer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that none of the publication had been circulated in the legitimate course of trade, before you missed these - A. There was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there one hundred copies circulated in the world - A. Possibly there might. I will not swear there was or was not three hundred. I do not think there was - there might he two hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. You believed Brooks could not have stolen them, but received them from other person - A. I did. Stewart had been discharged a few weeks previous to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he not dismissed for roguery - A. I cannot say that; he was dismissed under unpleasant suspicions. He was examined before the Justice when the prisoners were committed. He was once charged with taking a book up and putting it down.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Was it not stated to the Lord Mayor that Stewart had stolen one book - A. I said so - that was overlooked.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he charged in this felony with the other prisoners - A. He was, but not indicted. He helped to cart this particular work to the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the entry under your care - A. No, under the care of Bartrum.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you yourself examine the stock, and miss the copies - A. I did not. I checked the stock book, examined the papers of the stock, and found them right - I did not count the books. On the 22d or 23d of October the stock was taken by Whitthorne.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010064"/>MR. BOLLAND. Q. In June you issued orders for certain books, but for no perfect copies - A. Yes. The Lord Mayor discharged Stewart. The warehouse is merely a depot for works, which we send for when we want them. Sometimes we send there twice a day, and not again, possibly, for a fortnight.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When the stock was taken in June, were you present - A. No; I received the report from Whitthorne. I was not present in October neither. I have taken stock myself within this few days, to ascertain if his account in October was correct, and found it was so. I found two parts less missing than he stated.</p>

            . I am a warehouseman to the prosecutor. In June last I took the stock at the warehouse, in Shoemaker-row; Todd's Johnson was packed in a part of the warehouse by itself - it was all correct. What had been issued was marked off from a former account.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in October observe any thing about the warehouse - A. On Saturday, the 23d of October, I went and found the door left open - it should have been shut. There was a bundle, containing two copies of the dictionary just inside the door, down stairs - it ought to have been up stairs. I took stock that day, and missed some. I took stock again on Monday morning, the 25th, particularly, and missed twenty complete copies with the title page and portrait, ready to be bound, fifteen copies wanting the portrait, and five other copies wanting eight odd parts.</p>
               <p>Q. How were Robinson's Scripture Characters - A. Twelve complete sets were gone. Mr. Huntsman always made out delivery orders - there had been no order for a complete copy of that work between October and June. None were taken out to my knowledge in that interval.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You speak of some account by which you take stock - A. The account agrees with what had been delivered; no work can be delivered out of the warehouse without an order. Huntsman had access to the warehouse - Stewart had an opportunity of stealing the books if he liked, he could get the key. He was taken before the Lord Mayor with the prisoners, and was discharged - he is not here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do one or two persons take stock - A. A person writes down, while I count how many remaining copies there are, then we check it with the former account, and see if it agrees with those which are marked of.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live in Castle-street, Leicester-fields - I know Brooks. On the 31st of May he came to my house, and on or about the 10th of July, the 12th, 16th and the 31st of August or the 1st of September, and the 22d or 23d of September. On the 31st of August or the 1st of September, I bought two copies of Todd's Johnson of him.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy the copy you have to produce - A. I really do not know, for we buy them very often in sheets. I bought eight copies of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you buy of him on the 31st of August or the 1st of September - A. Two copies - I have known him three or four years as a dealer in books. The first copy he brought was in eleven parts, and the remainder in quires unfolded - one copy had no portrait, and he procured one to suit it. The others I believe were perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the copy that he brought a portrait to - A. I sent it to Miller's to be bound - he bound it and returned it. I delivered that copy to Bamfield on his coming to my house - he bought it of me. I gave Brooks 6 l. 15 s. for the first copy - I paid him 10 l. for two copies on the 1st of September. The average price of the whole was five guineas and a half, in ready money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you not think that a fair price - A. I certainly did. Brooks dealt in books.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not he like yourself and other tradesman, likely to buy them fairly from persons who brought them as shareholders - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. We are told that two hundred copies had been issued before the loss; had you seen several about in the trade - A. Yes, it was nothing uncommon to see them. I received them in sheets, and that is the regular way in which they were sold. Shareholders have been in the shop at the time the books were sold by Brooks, and to whom I mentioned the circumstance.</p>
               <p>Q. One copy had no portrait. I presume the portraits are delivered loose, and not pasted in - A. No, they are stuck in the sheets. Books are very commonly delivered imperfect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You cannot say on which of the days you mentioned you bought this copy of him - A. It must have been either in July or September. I did not know 7 l. 8 s. 6 d. was the return the prosecutors made for the copies.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAED. Q. Is it probable that a new work may be delivered without the portrait - A. It was as likely as any other work; I would not buy it without the portrait. I afterwards found a duplicate portrait in another book. The shareholders knew I gave five guineas and a half for it. Mr. Read. of Charing-cross, was one.</p>

             re-examined. I saw Harrison take the memorandum from Brooks's pocket, in consequence of which I found out several of the parties the books were sold to.</p>
               <p>BROOKS'S Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury. About the latter end of July I called at Broom's on business, he being a general dealer in books; he wished me to sell ten copies of Todd's Johnson for him, as I had a more extensive connexion than he had; he charged 5 l. and all that I could obtain more I was to have - I sold them in about a month. He said his friend had more, which must be either sold or pledged, as his friend wanted money to go into the country - I sold about twenty-five copies in all. Carlisle bought four copies, for which I took his note. Now was it likely that if a man had participated in the robbery he would have taken a bill with the articles mentioned in the body of it. I am well aware that there is no certainty where a bill gets, and it might get into the hands of Messrs. Longman. It has been stated that I sold them so low that I could not have honestly obtained them. It is a fair inferrence that if I can buy Rees's Encyclopedia at 9 s. 6 d. a part, which is published at one guinea, that this work should also sell low. I did not hesitate to give up the party I received them of. I always thought Broom a respectable man.</p>

I refer to his book, and find no entry of the 3d of August - it was not paid to me, if it had it would have been in the book - every thing he paid me was entered there.

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010066"/>Q. Soon after he left you did you find many accounts paid - A. Yes, I sent different accounts round, and had about fifty people at once come to say they did not owe me a farthing; I went through all my accounts, and had him apprehended. He was protected by a warrant of attorney which I granted; we agreed that he should give an exact account of what he had received, and for the sake of his wife and family I was to forgive him. An account was made out on his behalf by Mr. Bell, an attorney - the amount was 46 l. 5 s.</p>
               <p>Q. That warrant of attorney came down to August 1818 - A. Yes, and beyond that, it contained an account of different sums alledged by him to have been received from various customers. It was produced as an account of all he had defrauded me of - this 5 s. 6 d., was not in that account.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you took the concern you found the prisoner in the service - A. Yes, I have heard that he had been there twelve or fourteen years - he had been near three years with me. I kept an account of what beer was delivered to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have known what he owed you - A. No, I considered the money not brought by him as owing by the customers; I received an instalment of 3 l. on the warrant of attorney - I never gave him a character to any one. Several people came about his character, and I told them what he had done.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. You did not discover Mr. Harrison's debt till afterwards - A. No, I saw the warrant of attorney produced before the Magistrate, but never had it. Bell would not give it up to me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I left Mr. Wilson he had six weeks to examine his accounts. He had a warrant of attorney for the whole, which cleared every thing up to the 9th of June. He very often made mistakes in summoning people who owed him nothing.</p>

On the 21st of June, 1818, about seven o'clock in the morning, a neighbour rang the bell; I got up, found the party-wall broken through, and found a hole large enough for a man to get into my house; it was secure when I went to bed - the next house was empty. I missed the articles stated in the indictment from my shop-window, which were worth 130 l.. I saw none of them till last April, when eight rings and the snuffer-stand were produced by Goff.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You came down after daylight - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>GEOBGE GOFF, I am a constable of Lambeth. On the 29th of February last, in consequence of information, I went to No. 4, King-street, Snow's-fields, found the prisoner's wife there, and inquired for her husband? She said he was at Maidstone, in custody. I took her into custody, and locked the room up. Next morning I went there and found eight gold rings and the snuffer-stand, which the prosecutor claimed in April.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know how long the prisoner had been in custody at Maidstone - A. From August, 1818.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was he not there for passing bad money - A. I was told it was for horse stealing. I was told he had never lived in the house where I found the property.</p>

            , JUN. On the 3d of November, between twelve and one o'clock, I was going along Winchester-street, the prisoner came up, and asked me what I had got under my arm? She asked me what I had done to my arm? I said I had broken it - she said,</p>
               <p>"O my God, what a job!" she kept talking to me until we got to the turnpike, she then told me to go and knock at a door in the street facing the bar; she pointed the house out to me, said it was a private house, and that the servant would come to the door, and I was to ask for Mrs. Clark - she said she would hold my bundle, and wait at the end of the street. I found it was a shop, and not a private house, and came back, she was gone with the bundle. I am sure she is the woman. I saw her again next day.</p>

I was within three feet of the pay-place; the prisoner was on my right, he pressed against my nephew; I desired him to walk in, he said he should presently. I heard some silver drop, and found my right-hand pocket turned inside out - I told the check-taker of it. I saw the prisoner afterwards at Bow-street, and am sure he is the person who was on my right hand - he was close to the wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not take him then - A. There was a pressure at the time. I did not like to interfere.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any one near enough to take it but him - A. Several were behind, but I had my great-coat on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. You cannot say he committed the offence - A. I will not swear it. The passage was so narrow, it will not admit more than two persons abreast.</p>

On my turning again she had put it under her shawl. She walked out, saying the shoes would not do - she had not looked at them. Ransom, who was in the shop, said he saw her put something under her shawl. I looked, and missed a piece of stuff; she went out.

A little girl said the prosecutrix had lost a piece of stuff. I told her which way she was gone, and she went in pursuit of her. While she was gone I saw the prisoner come up Cumberland-street again to the next house to me; she offered it for sale there. I went to the prosecutrix's daughter, who tried to take it from her, she would not let her have it - I took it from her. She said I stole it from her, and was very insolent.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in Gloucester-street, Commercial-road. On the 16th of November, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner brought the floor-cloth - a woman came with him, who brought the carpet. The woman asked me to buy them - she wanted 2 l. for them; I offered her 28 s. for them both. They consulted together, and said I should have them. The prisoner said he was hired as a porter to bring them.</p>

She asked the prisoner if he was agreeable to take it? He said, No. They came in again, and she asked if he would take 28 s.? He said Yes, he was agreeable. They went out. On the Thursday following the prisoner came and asked my master to buy a stove, and he detained him. I am certain the woman consulted him about taking the money.

            . I am a waterman at the coach-stand, Whitehall. I heard an alarm of Stop thief! I looked round and saw a man running fast with a great coat under his arm. In attempting to pass him I caught hold of the arm of it; he threw it down, and I picked it up. I did not know him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT DAUNCEY. I am a fruiterer. I saw two men come from the Horse Guards; one of them kept the prosecutor's man in conversation. I saw the prisoner advance and snatch at the coat twice; the third time he completely got it off, put it under his left arm and ran. I called Stop thief! and went after him. He passed the coach and threw the coat against the wheel. I was on one side of the stand, and he on the other. I knocked my hat against the pole of the coach, and could not take him. I still followed and secured him, and brought him back three or four yards. He asked me where the gentleman was that owned the coat? I said I would shew him. I took him over to Mr. Child's. I have every reason to believe him to be the man who took it. I did not lose sight of him after he dropped the coat. I was close to him. He turned back and met me. I collared him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. The coaches were between you? Yes; I came round the first coach; several other people were pursuing him. He asked me who the coat belonged to before I mentioned it. It was a moonlight night.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I heard the alarm, saw about two hundred running, and run with them. I was tired, turned back, and met the witness half way, close to Whitehall-place. He said,</p>
               <p>"You are the man who stole the coat, and that he saw me take it off the horse." I asked him where the gentleman was that belonged to the coat? I was locked up with the soldiers till the prosecutor came. When taken before the Magistrate, he said he was knocked down by the pole of the coach. He said the man took it from the off side; if so he must have passed the servant. If I took it he must have seen me through the horses.</p>

On the 4th of November, between six and seven o'clock in the evening, I was in the Edgware-road, and saw the prisoner coming along with a bundle under his arm - knowing him, I suspected it did not belong to him. When he came near me I turned round, and looked him full in the face. Immediately he saw me he threw the bundle down, and ran off, but I followed him about a hundred yards and took him. He said he was going to take them to the mangle. I took him to the watch-house, and found they belonged to Norton of the Harrow-road.</p>

He said he had a sack of flour in it - he came into the stable, and helped it to feed the horses; he kept hanging about the stable - he went to the tail of the waggon and looked in; I asked him what he wanted? but he made no answer. Soon after that he lifted up the lid of the box, took this parcel out, put it under his smock-frock, and ran down a lane. I followed him about a quarter of a mile - when I came nearly up to him he threw the bundle down. We caught him, and he said,</p>
               <p>"Let me go, and I will go back with you." He said if we did not loose him, he would soon do for us, and twenty such as us, and if he could get his hands at liberty he would do it - I gave him in charge. He said he hoped that it would transport him, as he was tired of the country.</p>

            . On the 18th of November, I left my place, at Mr. Williams's, at Stepney-green, and left my box at the green-grocer's, at the corner of Stepney-green till next day, and then being recommended by that woman, I employed the prisoner to carry it to Pentonville - I agreed to give him 2 s. 6 d., and said I would go with him. We set out; he met his brother, and asked him the nearest way. He walked very slow, and took very long rests - I told him to walk his pace. He then rested on a post for near a quarter of an hour - it being very cold, I and my sister walked on, but not perceiving him behind we went back. When he saw us he came on, and carried it as far as the Hackney-road, rested a long time, and then carried it about ten minutes longer, and sat down at a public-house door in the Hackney-road. Being very cold I gave him a pint of beer, and directed him to bring it to No. 6, Suffolk-street, Pentonville - I told him three times, then left him, and went on. Not finding him come I went as far as Finsbury-square, but could get no tidings of the box; I went to Stepney-green that evening - he had not returned. Next morning I gave information at the office, and he was apprehended on Saturday - this was on Thursday. I found two gowns, an apron, and a handkerchief at the pawnbroker's - that is all I have found - I am sure the prisoner is the man.</p>

            . I am a schoolmaster, and live at No. 56, Church-street, Mile End. On the 18th of November the prisoner brought a box to my house, and asked to leave it till he went home to tea. He came about eight o'clock, and said he wanted something out of it; he brought a young man with him, who he said was brother to the young woman that belonged to it. He said it was too late to take it home, but she wanted some things - he took it away next morning. I knew him before; his father is a respectable hair-dresser, and his brother once lodged with me.</p>

               <p>Q. Had all the copies the portrait - A. Three of them had it - one was deficient. I sold two. I have the one that wants the portrait, and produce it now - it was in quires, I sent it to be bound.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you bought it of him had it the portrait - A. I cannot say - I only examined one.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe the day the bill became due you could not take it up - A. No. While it laid unpaid, a person called, whom I believe to be Harrison, but cannot be positive - he called the evening it was due; I paid it afterwards. I gave the bill to Brooks - (bill read).</p>

            . I am clerk to Saul and Saddington, who are wine and brandy merchants - Broom dealt at our house. I took the bill produced, in payment, of him. When he offered it I looked at the endorsement of Brooks, and asked who he was? he said Brooks had nothing to do in point of payment, that he had nothing to do with the bill, and was only employed to sell the goods for it. He said he had employed Brooks to sell the goods, and he had nothing to do with the payment, and if we took it we must look to him (Broom) or the drawer for payment, and not to Brooks. The money has been received for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it honoured when due - A. Not exactly on the day. I went to Broom about it, and told him I was sorry the bill I had received of him was not paid. He said it would be paid he had no doubt, for the house was respectable, and I had better go and inquire about it.</p>

I am in the employ of the Sheriff of Middlesex - I know Brooks and Broom; I have known Broom many years, and have been in the habit of seeing him at the Three Tuns, in Brook-street, Holborn. I have frequently seen him with a bundle. I have seen Brooks go out with the bundles, leaving Broom there, and then return to Broom without any thing. I did not observe who brought the bundles in. I have seen Brooks bring silver, and pay it to Broom, and have seen Broom return part to him again. I think it was about the month of August.</p>

            . I lived at the Three Tuns, public-house, Brook-street, Holborn, last summer, and have seen Brooks and Broom there several times - they brought in their parcels and sat there. I think Brooks went out, and came back to Broom.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the person who went out take any thing with him - A. He took the parcels out. I once saw one of them open on the table - they appeared to be the sheets of a book; I observed it was a very good type. My first husband was a bookseller. I saw them several times at the house. I think it was in July and August.</p>

            . I keep the King's Arms, and have frequently seen the prisoner at my house. I was at the back of the bar when Wood served him. I heard the sound of a bad shilling, immediately went out, and charged him with passing a bad shilling, telling him he had frequently served me that trick - he denied it. I said I was determined to have him searched. He ran to the door, I secured him, and took him into my back parlour, Moore brought in the bag, which contained five bad shillings. I took the 2 s. off the counter myself; one was good, and the other base, and gave them to Sheppard. Some good silver, consisting of a half-crown, a shilling, and some sixpences were found on him.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Gray. I saw the prisoners in the yard about half-past five o'clock - I was in the stable, about twenty yards off. I knew them before - I had worked with Price. Price took one coat off the carriage and Woodgate took the other. I did not stop them.</p>
               <p>Q. You consented to the theft - A. No. I did not follow them, nor tell my fellow-servants about it. I informed Mr. Gray of it. I was taken up, and come from gaol now.</p>

               <p>Q. Had he power to dispose of your stock in any way as his own - A, Certainly not. Mr. Hamilton came to our house and put some tickets into my hand, which are our private marks, they have been on our goods, and are used in our shop. They apply to no other goods but silk stockings. When I first saw them I discovered them to be the marks of silk stockings.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HAMILTON. I am a carpenter and chair-maker, and lodge in Clement's-lane, in the same house with the prisoner Smith; she lodged on the first floor and I in the attic story. I was five weeks in the house, and dieted with her during that time. She was there when I came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner, Harbour, there - A. Yes, several times in her room. She represented him as her cousin, who had just come from Wales. On the 11th of October, about eleven o'clock, I came home for a tool. I have one room on the attic, which has no door but the door at the lobby; the key of that door was left with the prisoner Smith. I knocked at her door, but did not speak; I received no answer, but thought I heard a noise inside. The door was shut; there were two frames on the stairs which had no glass in them; I looked through them and saw Harbour give her two pieces of Bandana silk handkerchiefs. I went out to the bottom of the lane, and looked in at a picture shop till I thought he was gone. I then returned, and knocked at her door for the key. She gave it to me directly. Her door was then wide open, and only she was there. I had been away about twenty-five minutes. When I was coming down with the tool she said,</p>
               <p>"Come in, my cousin Richard was here just now, and I will shew you what a handsome present he has brought me." She opened a little box, which I had made for her, and shewed me fourteen silk handkerchiefs, and said,</p>
               <p>"These were in two pieces a while ago, seven in each piece; and he gave me two pair of silk stockings, which I popped, and got 5 s. a pair on them, at Harris's, in the Strand; and Mr. Burgess, the clerk, said, if I had one hundred pair he would buy them all of me." I went away, and did not come home till about seven o'clock in the evening. Her husband and one

            , a tailor, were there then. I asked for a piece of candle to light me to bed. I wanted to know if Williams or her husband could know any thing of the handkerchiefs or not; and as I went up stairs I put the candle out, stopped on the stairs, looked into her room, and saw her open the box, and shew them the handkerchiefs, I heard her say she had received them from Richard. They always called him Richard only.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Richard and her together - A. On the 24th, which was Sunday, about eleven o'clock, I was coming out of her room - her husband and her were there, and a strange man, a carpenter.

            , the tailor - her husband was present; she said Williams was up stairs finishing a jacket. He said I will go up to see him. She went up and shewed him the room. I was in my own room and could hear what passed. She stopped a few minutes, and then went down. I heard her send her husband out for apples; he asked the other man to go with him, and he did. She ran up stairs and asked Richard to come down, for there was nobody there. I went down to this window, saw Richard take a paper out of his hat, and another from inside his coat next to his shirt and waistcoat. He asked Smith to give him the scissars to cut the marks off, saying,</p>
               <p>"Here is eleven pair of silk stockings." She said,</p>
               <p>"What price are they marked?" He said they sold for 11 s. in the shop. He left her in about twenty minutes. She called me down stairs that day, said her cousin, Richard, had made her a handsome present of eleven pair of silk stockings, and shewed them to me. I said he must be situated in a great way, must be in a large shop, and was beginning trade very soon. I said I had heard in my country of Bow-street officers, who were called</p>
               <p>"Blood-hounds," and she had better take care what she was doing, for he was a young man. She said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, let Tafiy alone for that." When he left on the Sunday, he said,</p>
               <p>"I will be here at eleven o'clock to-morrow." It was my determination from the first to find out where he came from. I saw him there on the Tuesday, about eleven o'clock, and saw him take three papers of black and white silk stockings out. He said he wanted a little money; and she said,</p>
               <p>"I will go and spout a couple of pair." She went out, and returned in about twenty minutes. He remained there till she returned with her little girl, who is eight or nine years old. She desired the little girl to lock the door and keep the key, if any one came to say her mother was out, and had got the key. While she was out Richard kept looking at his watch and papers. When she returned she gave him some money - how much I do not know. She afterwards told me he had brought twenty-four pair of stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find out how he was employed - A. This went on for about five weeks. She called me down, and shewed me four pair of silk stockings with clocks; she wanted me to take up a board in the floor to put them under. I said, perhaps the officers might come in and catch me about it, and I should be thought as bad as her. She said she had thought of a better plan - she would spout them for a little, as she did not mean to stay long in London, and the rats might get them there. One day after he brought some stockings, he said he would bring no more, for a young man was discharged that day. She said, " Why, you said it was impossible to find it out, for you was put into the shop to sleep, as a greenhorn, and it was impossible for you to have any acquaintance." I had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010076"/>heard him say that myself one day, and that he got up in the night and took them.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find him out - A. She always came down to let him out. On Saturday, the 13th, I went out as he was going out, and followed him to Messrs. Todds', in Fore-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you before that got any cards - A. Yes; the first day when he brought the eleven pair of stockings he cut off the marks, and they fell on the carpet by the bed-side. After he was gone she called me, and the first thing I did was to pick up the bits of cards, and put them into my pocket. When I found where he lived, I gave them to Mr. Morrison, and informed him of every thing. I am positive they are the marks I saw cut from the stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she at any time ask you to do any thing with some marks - A. On the 27th, I saw Richard give her three pair of black silk stockings. He said,</p>
               <p>"I am in a hurry, and cannot cut the marks off, as I am going with a person to Russell-square, and have left him in the baker's-shop while I ran here." When he was gone she came up stairs and went into a room next to where I was at work; she had a white bundle. She said,</p>
               <p>"My cousin, Richard, has brought me a handsome present." I saw twenty-four pair of black silk stockings. She said they were marked 15 s. a pair. I said there was no such mark. She asked me to cut off the marks. I was going to do it with my chisel. She said I should dirt them, and she would go down and do it herself. I went down also. She sat in her room and desired her daughter to call up the landlord of the house. I had seen her shew them to the landlord always when Richard brought them. She represented him to the landlord as her brother.</p>

             - A. Yes, I have taken another name for the last three weeks, in consequence of this woman, as I was informed her husband was determined to kill me if he saw me. I told Mr. Morrison to write to me by the name of Welch. I did not give that name to avoid being drawn for the militia.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know Mr. Morgan - A. My father died when I was four years old, and my mother married Morgan. I served my time to him, and am better known by that name in my own country.</p>
               <p>Q. You swore at Bow-street your name was Hamilton, but the name you was known by in your country was Welch - A. Yes. If you had 4000 l. a-year you would change your name, as I changed mine for the sake of my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Hamilton, who was tried at Cork - A. No. I was never tried in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not leave Cork because you was tried there and lost your character - A. No, for I have been there lately, and bought provisions, pork and bacon, about a year ago. If you were at me till to-morrow morning you will get nothing from me but the truth. I staid in this country about six weeks, then returned, and was shipwrecked.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw this business going on for five weeks - you knew where the Police officers were - A. Yes, I went to them. They said they could do nothing in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the hole covered with paper and a curtain - A. For the first fortnight there was no curtain, after that there was one; I could put my finger through and draw it aside. I have told nothing that I saw after the curtain was up. I never fell out with Smith till the first week she came to Clement's-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, was you not jealous of her on account of a Captain that came to her - A. No, I never was jealous of her. She never lent me money - I lent her some when her husband was taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought her some ear-rings - A. I did not. When I finished my work at Messrs. Poynters, in the City, I laid out 5 l. 15 s. in things to take to my country, and laid them under my bed. I bought her no ear-rings, but she took them from me.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath, did you not charge her at Bow-street with being too intimate with a Captain - A. On my oath, No. I never saw any misconduct in her till she came to Clement's-lane. I told the Magistrate of some indecency between her and the other prisoner.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not the silk stockings found under your bed - A. No, I never had any.</p>
               <p>Q. You had ear-rings - A. Yes, and nine ladies' silk handkerchiefs, which I bought and paid for; here is the bill of them - (producing it).</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not said you never would have told a word of what you stated if she had lent you a 1 l. note on the day she was taken up - A. I never did to any one.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you keep any other servant - A. A very short part of the time - the prisoner was servant of all work. I left them in care of my house in September when I myself was absent. I afterwards disposed of my house and furniture. Some time before November I lost many articles of linen, such as pillow-cases, neck-handkerchiefs, and shirts. About the beginning of November I began to suspect that the prisoner was dishonest, but took no notice, having matters of importance to call my attention, as I was about selling my house at that time. About the 14th or 16th of November, I missed two salt, one mustard, and a table-spoon. I communicated it to Mr. Want.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you communicate it to the prisoner - A. I did, and in reply she told me. in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Want, and Miss Butler, that when she engaged with me, she did not engage to pay for losses. I took no farther notice then, but sold my house, and gave possession to Mr. Arnot, who was of the same business a myself. The prisoner was not in the house then.</p>
               <p>Q. Were her boxes in the house - A. I believe they were, but I never saw them. The morning after I had given possession of the house to Arnot, I called and told him that I had sold the furniture to Mr. Want. He then handed me over these spoons, which I had missed some days before; he said he had taken them from a small box, which he conceived to be the prisoner's, and to the best of my recollection I had mentioned to him that I had lost them.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010078"/>Q. Did you lose two boxes - A. I lost various articles, but do not know the extent.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at last take the prisoner before the Magistrate - A. I did. She was to have called upon me next morning to take away her boxes. She was to have gone to Want's house, in Russell-place, for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see her afterwards - A. At Marlborough-street. I lost printed furniture, two books, and other articles. I made a complaint there.</p>
               <p>Q. On that occasion I believe the Magistrate dismissed the complaint - A. Yes. I went again before the Magistrate, and she was committed,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. How long have you been in business in Charlotte-street - A. To the best of my recollection about three years - the prisoner had lived sixteen months with me.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew that though she was a servant, she was a girl very respectably connected - A. I did not.

               <p>Q. You have not brought her here - A. I have not; she lived two months with me, to the best of my recollection. I had been unfortunate in business.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the furniture given over to Want for the benefit of your creditors - A. When speaking of being unfortunate, I do not admit of being unfortunate then. I mean fourteen months before, when I called my creditors together.</p>
               <p>Q. When you gave up business was it in consequence of being unfortunate - A. It was in consequence of believing that I could do better out of business.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you give up your property to your creditors - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You sold it to Want - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>A. I believe you had been arrested on the morning of the 15th of November -

            Possibly.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not leave the house then for two days with the prisoner and another person in it - A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect quitting your house for one day - A. I never left my house for six hours.</p>
               <p>Q. There cannot be any doubt in your mind; which am I to take as an answer - A. I was arrested I know, but do not remember the date.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Was you not taken out of your bed - A. I do not recollect that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not indebted to the prisoner 15 l. or 16 l. at that time for wages - A. I was not, on my oath.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you owe her - A. To the best of my recollection 10 l. or 11 l.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, did not you and Want offer a joint promissory note, at two months, for the 15 l. claimed as her wages, if she would not proceed in an action - A. I have no recollection of it. It was not offered by me.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not Want told you it was offered to her - A. In our joint names? No. No one offered it to her by my advice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it offered by Want - A. As he tells me. This was before I charged her with felony.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect coming home after you was arrested, and the prisoner came and asked you for her wages, and you committed an assault upon her - A. I do not recollect it. On my oath I did not assault her; she took me to Bow-street, and charged me with assaulting her. I was ordered to find security to appear at the last Clerkenwell Sessions. Want was my bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Last Session you was to find bail, and you had her in custody so that she should not appear against you - A. It was not for that.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not several days after she made the charge against you, that you charged her with the felony - A. It was not. I believe she charged me with the assault on the 15th or 16th of November.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you charge her with the felony - A. To the best of my recollection about the 20th of November.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have sworn you did not assault her, on the oath I ask you, when Clark, the officer, took you into custody, did you not tell him you was sorry you had beat her, for she was a very excellent servant - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not charge her at Marlborough-street with the robbery of a shoehorn - A. Not on the first charge.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on your oath, was not that the property of another person - A. On my oath I believe it to be mine. I did not charge her with stealing an old pair of trowsers. There was a pair produced - it was not proved that they belonged to Mr. Slim.</p>
               <p>Q. She was examined first on a Thursday - A. I believe she was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not detained on a representation that you was in the country - A. I cannot tell what passed in my absence. I attended the first examination, which I believe was on Saturday. On my return to Dr. Want's, where I resided, he told me he had taken her up, I believe on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know from Dr. Want that the examination was put off from Thursday to Saturday, on the ground of your being in the country, which was false - A. I believe it was. I gave evidence on Saturday, and she was dismissed. She was taken up on this present charge on the Monday following, to the best of my recollection. Her box had been removed from my house to Want's.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was discharged she left her box where it was - A. At the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, do not you know that Want opened her box with a key which he provided himself - A. On my oath he did not. The constable had keys, with which I believe he opened it at the watch-house. I do not believe it was opened by his key or mine.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you suspected her long before, why not charge her with the robbery when she charged you with the assault - A. I had a multiplicity of things to attend to. I do not know how it was that I did not; though I had reason to suspect her I had not proof then, and did not chuse to go further in the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was taken up on the second charge, the Magistrate said she should be admitted to bail, and you resisted it - A. The magistrate put it to me, and I said she must not.</p>
               <p>Q. Here are two boxes in the indictment, which belong to a dressing-case, and are like tea-caddies - A. They may bear some resemblance. I do not know that she drank her tea with the cup and saucer - the spoon is mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010079"/>Q. What are the stockings - A. There are three lamb's wool and four cotton, to the best of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. She was acquitted by the Magistrate, and might have had her box from the watch-house, but did not - A. No. she was not present when it was opened - the property was all found in her box at the watch-house. The constable was present when it was found.</p>
               <p>Q. Before her box was taken to the watch-house it laid two or three days at Want's house - A. I am told so. It was at his house three or four days while I lodged there - she was not there then. I did not charge her with stealing the spoons at the first examination. I did not know they were lost.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why not inform the Magistrate about the spoons - A. I did not then wish to prosecute her.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why charge her with stealing any thing - A. I missed several things.</p>

             with me - we saw the prisoner there. I went up stairs, and Miss Butler went into the kitchen. I went down soon after, and saw the prisoner there - I was surprised at seeing her there, knowing the circumstances under which she was discharged; this was on the 20th - she was discharged on the 16th. I mentioned my suspicions to Miss Butler that she was after no good; she appeared to be rummaging about the kitchen, and we determined to speak to Arnot to send her out of the house. He was up stairs; I informed him of my suspicions, and told him Wilmot had lost various articles, and Mr. Arnot was aware of the spoons that had been lost. He said,</p>
               <p>"If you think it right to send her away do it." I went down, and expostulated with her on the impropriety of her being there when she had been discharged. She said she would not go without her boxes, and wanted to send for a constable to remove them. I said,</p>
               <p>"No, they shall not go without Mr. Wilmot's permission." I was induced to say that in consequence of having seen in her hand, a pie-dish wrapt up ready for removal, and a table-cloth, which I supposed was going away - it was by her box. I took the table-cloth away from the conviction that she was going to remove it, and saw it was marked W. After some altercation the boxes were taken up, and examined in the presence of Miss Butler, Arnot, myself, and the prisoner; there were two boxes, and three or four little bundles; a variety of articles were taken out, and put into a bundle, which appeared to be Wilmot's property, as they were marked 
               <persName id="t18191201-167-person1690">W. </persName>
            - they were put by until Wilmot made his appearance. On the following day the boxes were removed to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. You took out what you conceived to be Wilmot's - A. Yes, and other things, which we thought were her's, but what she said were her's we left. The boxes were received by him, with the furniture, but not by my desire. A few days after - I do not know the time exactly, the prisoner applied to me in the morning for her boxes. In the mean time Wilmot had stated, that as far as he had seen the contents of the bundle, they were his, from the particular circumstances were stated with respect to the stockings and other articles, and he said he would have her taken to Marlborough-street. The boxes and bundle were brought into the parlour in her presence; she opened the bundle. The table-cloth which was taken from her had been put into the bundle in moving.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. That was put in by you - A. I cannot say who put it in - it was mentioned to her that there was no intention to charge her with it. She took out the tablecloth, a piece of printed furniture, and a pair of pantaloons, which she said were her master's. She afterwards went out for a coach, to remove them from my house. Wilmot had desired me to get a constable. We sent for one, followed the coach, and took her to Marlborough-street. The constable took the box, bundles, and all to the watch-house. I asked what we were to do, as the prosecutor was not there? The watch-house-keeper said we had better take her to the Magistrate for his opinion. We did so, and the Magistrate remanded her till the prosecutor could appear. This was Thursday.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Wilmot then - A. He was gone into the City, I believe, on business.</p>
               <p>Q. By what authority was she taken up at all - A. By Wilmot's authority.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Wilmot and you appeared on Saturday - A. Yes; and on hearing us the Magistrate discharged her.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. She was apprehended and brought before the same Magistrate on Monday - A. Yes, on that occasion she was committed.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Her boxes and all were before the Magistrate on the Saturday - A. Yes. A new charge was made on Monday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Are you a surgeon and apothecary - A. Yes. I have been long acquainted with Wilmot.</p>
               <p>
            
                  <persName id="t18191201-167-person1691">Q. </persName>
            Are you in the habit of bailing each other - A. He never bailed me. I have bailed him, perhaps three times, for civil actions. We did not accommodate each other with bills.</p>

               <p>Q. On your oath, has not Mr. Jeffries, the chief clerk of the Common Pleas, a bill of yours now in his possession - A. I will explain that. Dyer is the drawer, and I am the endorser. It is six months over due.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any more bills out, jointly issued by you two - A. I think I may venture to swear not, but you take me by surprise.</p>
               <p>Q. You bought Wilmot's furniture - A. Yes; I gave him about 98 l. for it, and paid him in money about the time Arnot took possession - it is now in my house in Clarendon-square. I had no bill of sale. I was at Bow-street when the prisoner charged the prosecutor with an assault - it was about the 14th of November. I do not recollect the date that we made the charge against her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that was he arrested at the suit of the girl - A. In the evening Wilmot requested me to see the girl. I saw her, and gave her 10 s. She was surrounded by a party, who persuaded her to say the 10 s. was given her as part of her wages, and not in discharge of the assault. Wilmot was not present. I advised him to put in bail, and put in no answer. The robbery was not committed for three or four days after.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she go to the prosecutor's after the charge was made at Bow-street - A. Wilmot went to the door and bolted her out.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010080"/>Q. Her boxes were locked in and she out - A. Yes. I think Arnot took possession three or four days after that.</p>
               <p>Q. She had no access to her boxes - Miss Butler and Mrs. Want were there - A. No; she was confined to her bed. I believe the greater part of the things were taken out. She said the boxes of the dressing-case were hers.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, were they produced before Miss Butler - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not state to the Justice that the property was found in her possession - A. I did not then know they were Wilmot's. She stated so confidently they belonged to her tea-caddy - they were not mentioned to the Magistrate till the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Want swear to a shoehorn - A. I did not hear him swear positively to that.</p>
               <p>Q. When she was discharged on Saturday, were you not told that you and Want should be indicted for a conspiracy in bringing her there - A. Certainly we were told so by the attorney.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did not the prisoner (when you offered her to take her boxes away) say she would not take them till she could have all her property - A. I believe solemnly that she was not offered.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it did not pass - A. I cannot recollect. I did not see her boxes from the time they came to my house till she called.</p>

               <p>Q. Who gave her 2 s. to get a coach - A. I did. I wished to ascertain where her residence was, but could not. I had not asked her, but I suspected she would not tell me. I did not put a man into the coach with her - I sent Jones to follow it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who ran after the coach with a pair of pantaloons in his hand - A. Not me. I believe the constable carried them. I desired him to take the pantaloons and the printed furniture which she had left behind.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you been to the watch-house between the Saturday and Monday - A. No. I had no key that would open her box.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not go to Mr. Jeffries about the bill, and tell him the girl was discharged, though fifty pair of stockings were found in her possession - A. I do not recollect the precise number. I will not swear I did not, but I think not. There was a considerable quantity of stockings marked</p>
               <p>"W." I am sure there were thirty stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. If any one had said there were only five single stockings of one sort and four of the other, it is an untruth - A. I should think he had stated an untruth.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, when the girl had arrested Mr. Wilmot, did you not propose to give her your joint acceptance for 15 l., to put an end to it - A. No, not at the time of the assault. When the warrant was issued, she said she only wished her wages. I pointed out to her the impropriety of taking her master to Bow-street, and said, if that was all she wanted I would see her wages paid. She was surrounded by persons, who said they would have good security for the wages. I said I would undertake to see furniture put into her possession. On the night of the final examination she attended at my house about her wages; and it was distinctly understood that she should have them in a few days. I said I would give her a bill of exchange for the wages. 13 l. was at first named. She afterwards claimed 15 l. - it was to be my own bill. I recollected nothing about a joint bill. Wilmot did not know of it. Some of the persons round said, they knew nothing of me; and I said she should have furniture. I do not believe he assaulted her.</p>

I found the spoons in a small straw work cabinet belonging to the prisoner. I gave them to Mr. Wilmot. I found them on the Tuesday morning when I took possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present afterwards when the prisoner's boxes were searched - A. Yes; the prisoner, Miss Butler, and Want were present. Those things, which Want and Butler considered doubtful, were put aside. The boxes remained in my possession till Monday, when the men took them with Want's things.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ALLEY. Q. Whatever was found, was found before the examination at Malborough-street - A. Yes, they had the opportunity of charging her with the spoons then.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BROADRICK. Q. The prisoner continued in your service until he was taken - A. Yes. He was to navigate the barge.</p>
               <p>JAMES ATTWOOD. I am an Excise watchman. On the 11th of November, in the evening, I was sent for to take charge of the bags of pepper. Next morning, I was coming up the River, and missed the men from the oars; the prisoner and another had both left. I went aft, and immediately Peck came forward. I saw the other sewing up a bag of pepper, and a parcel of loose pepper was in a handkerchief by his side - I took it from him, put it by my side, and kept alongside the bag. The watchman called to Peck to help move the bag, which he did. When I came up to the ship I went to shew it to the superior officer, and took the prisoner with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when you missed them from their oars - A. I was forward, in the same barges; they were all together. Peck came forward on seeing me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where was the barge when you went to her - A. At Bow Creek. It was not a wet night then. I heard the oars cease when we were about the lower part of Limehouse - they both ceased together. I went aft directly, and met the prisoner coming forward. The other man said he was only going to take a little pepper for his own use. The prisoner remained in the barge with me. He did not go to the superior officer with me. I cannot find the watchman.</p>

               <p>PATRICK FOX. I lodged with the prisoner from the 15th to the 27th of November. I went out, and left my parcels all safe, next morning I missed all these things, out of the parcels, which were tied up as before. I ran down and said I had been robbed, and did not know what to do. He said he would have no fuss in his house, and put me in fear. I was obliged to go away. I had him apprehended - the Magistrate told him to look for my property. I called once or twice about it - he always gave surly answers.</p>

On the 8th of November the prisoner came to our shop, and brought a note from his father, who is a customer of ours, and is a tobacconist in Gravel-lane. I have a paper, which he presented to Mr. Lloyd; it is an order for 6 lbs. of shag and 6 lbs. of cut tobacco - I delivered it to him. It was worth 2 l. 18 s.; he took it away. I saw him in custody at Guildhall afterwards, and know him to be the person.</p>

I said we did. He came about an hour or two after with two pieces of woollen cloth (as I thought) under his arm - the number of the cloth was on the paper, and the length marked - it was forty yards. I opened the paper, and unrolled it about a quarter of a yard, and examined the quality of the cloth. I asked him the quantity? he said about forty yards; that he himself was the manufacturer, that his name was

            , and his manufactory was at Frome. I asked him how much would answer his present purpose? he said about 6 l. would be quite sufficient - he warranted each to measure forty yards at least, and said he made and measured them. I did not measure them, as if they had been of that length they would have been worth more. I advanced him six 1 l. notes on the two pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of his coming again, had you occasion to examine these cloths - A. Yes. I unrolled a piece, and found the first four or five yards was cloth, then three yards of green baize, and under that a hollow wooden cylinder. The cloth and baize were worth 23 s. It had the appearance of a roll of cloth, list was fastened at each end to give it that appearance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. Do you advance money without measuring things - A. Frequently. He did not say he was sent by any one with it.</p>
               <p>MR. WALFORD stated to the Jury, that he was instructed to inform them that the prisoner had been made the dupe of another person, he being a stranger to the tricks of town.</p>

There was a truss of blue cloth on the copse, which had been brought to town by the waggon - it was near two large trusses and could not be easily got out. I was getting a large truss into Mr. Cash's, and as I had got it on my knee, I turned round, and saw the prisoner pulling the truss out of the cart. I laid hold of him directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ARABIN. Q. Was the street clear - A. Yes. The prisoner was dressed like a dandy. The truss was worth 15 l.</p>

            . I keep the Castle, public-house, in King-street, nearly opposite Cash's; I saw the cart stop there, and saw two men lurking about it - one was in the path and the other in the road.</p>

            Was either of them the prisoner - A. I cannot exactly say, One of them was pushing this truss up with his hands - he was in front of the cart; the other stood in the middle of the road. I saw him push it twice; every time the waggoner came out they withdrew, and got into a doorway to conceal themselves. The waggoner went in again; the shortest was pulling the truss. The waggoner came out, seized him, and threw him into the passage. The prisoner is one of the two I saw before - I ran across directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You was several doors off - A. About five doors - it was about seven o'clock in the evening. There was no puppy in the cart.</p>

I saw a boy, named Watts, come in, and look round - I was in the counting-house, and could not be seen. He returned in about a quarter of an hour. I turned round a moment, and he took the soap; I saw him going out with it under his arm, pursued him, and to the best of my knowledge, I saw the prisoner running on the other side - he had a coat on like the prisoner. I secured Watts about three hundred yards off, with the soap, and took him to the watch-house - the prisoner was taken the next day.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was in High-street, and saw the prisoner and Watts very near Dyson's shop. Next morning I found Watts at the watch-house, and in consequence of information I went after the prisoner, and saw him in Stafford-street, Lisson-green. He knew me, turned his head, and ran up two or three streets. I told him I wanted him for stealing soap the night before, and said,</p>
               <p>"Why, I thought you had had enough of it last Session." He said,</p>

I took his hand out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the notes in his hand when you took it out - A. Yes, I kept hold of him. The mob dragged me into the Fountain passage, and knocked me down; I saw him hand my notes over to a companion - I never got them again. I never lost sight of the prisoner until he was secured.</p>

               <p>Q. When he stopped you he desired you to go into the public-house with him - A. Never, the mob dragged me into the passage - I cried out Murder! The publican opened the door to let them in, and they called for beer. I sat with them to prevent the prisoner from getting away, and sent for an officer; I told the officer that I saw him give the notes to another man, who ran down the street.

               <p>Q. He was discharged by the Magistrate, and you had him taken up the night before last on a Judge's warrant - A. I had him taken up - he was at his own house. He gave his address to the Magistrate.</p>

I was coming home on the 1st of November, and saw a crowd towards the bottom of Newcastle-street. Sullivan cried out Murder! - he had hold of the prisoner's hand, and said he had robbed him of ten 1 l. notes. They went into the Fountain, public-house - I did not see any body strike him. I could not get into the public-house for the crowd, and so went home.</p>

I only know Sullivan had hold of him.</p>

            . I live at Walthamstow, on my property, at my uncle's, who keeps a boarding-school. The prisoner is my brother. I was with him on the 1st of November. We dined together at a chop-house in Drury-lane, and staid there till twenty minutes before six o'clock, and were then going home to tea to my mother's, in Brunswick-street, Blackfriars-road, where my brother lives. We were arm-in-arm, got to the top of Wych-street, and saw a great number of people collected. We went up, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010085"/>before we came close to the crowd I heard a man crying, or rather bellowing,</p>
               <p>"I am robbed." He appeared to be raising off the ground, covered with mud and blood. We were endeavouring to get out of the way; he instantly put his hand out and caught hold of my brother, saying,</p>
               <p>"You have robbed me!" My brother said,</p>
               <p>"If you think I have, send for an officer and search me." We entered the public-house at the corner - I do not know the sign, the man followed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he continue his hold - A. He did not. He persisted in charging my brother with robbing him, and said,</p>
               <p>"If you will give me the 10 l. I will not send for an officer, and you may go about your business." My brother said,</p>
               <p>"No, send for the officer, I insist on being searched." We went into a private room, remained till the officer came, and were both searched; nothing was found on us. We were tied together, taken to Bow-street, and examined. The man appeared at first, to say, he had been collecting money at the west end of the town. We had only one witness, who was a young man, and in the crowd. The Magistrate told the prosecutor he must make a mistake. He appeared very drunk. My brother gave his true address to the Magistrate, and was desired to attend again. We went again on the Thursday following; Mr. Birnie was present. The prosecutor said he had seen Mr. Birnie at the Finsbury Meeting - the charge was dismissed. He has since preferred a bill against my brother. I am positive the prisoner could not have committed the robbery without my knowledge, and I am sure he did not.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Sage, a liquor-merchant, who lives in Clare-market. Sullivan generally has a stall under our window, and brings us notes to investigate. I saw him on the Monday after this happened; I cannot say whether he was drunk or not. On the day of the examination he charged me with not giving him the notes.</p>

On the 15th of November, the prisoner came and asked me to give him change for a 10 l. note; we were in complete confusion at the time, having had a very large fire in the neighbourhood. I took him nine 1 l. notes, and one pound in silver. He asked me what he owed? - it was 3 s. He had half a pint of gin, which I took into the parlour with the notes. I put the notes and silver down, which he counted, and said,</p>
               <p>"Allow me to leave this bundle in the bar, and I will call and pay your score."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you a 10 l. note - A. He did not - it was a neglect of mine, certainly. I immediately sent to his father's, who lives at No. 11, in our street, and inquired if he was there? He was not, and had not been there. I saw no more of him till the Saturday following, when I gave him into custody. I am certain he never put down the 10 l. note, or left the bundle at the bar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. WALFORD. Q. You expected a 10 l. note - A. Certainly. My house was full of firemen, and he took advantage of it.</p>

On the 12th of November, about eight o'clock, the prisoners, Imber, Hunt, and another, who has escaped, came into the shop to buy fruit. They noticed the clock that was in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010089"/>shop, and Hunt and the other went up to it - the spoons were just by it. They bought an apple and left the shop. I missed the spoons directly, went after them with my husband, overtook them in a few minutes with Wright, and gave them in charge.</p>
               <p>JOHN GARVA. I am a constable of Hackney. I was informed the boys had stolen the spoons, and went out. I secured Wright, the other two were about fifty yards off; I secured them, but could not find the fourth. I found the spoons in Wright's hat.</p>

            . On the 1st of December, between nine and ten o'clock, I saw the prisoners at the Elephant and Castle, public-house, Camden-town, coming towards Battle-bridge. Knowing Cassimere, I followed them to the Wheatsheaf, they parted there. I missed them, they joined again - I lost sight of them, and in a few minutes they came down Maiden-lane - Cassimere had the coat under his arm. I secured them, and told them I had been watching them for half an hour. Cassimere said he knew nothing of it.</p>

I let the prisoner a room - he slept in a room where there were two other beds; he had a bed to himself, and was to pay 1 s. per night. He took it on the 25th of October for one night. Next morning he sent the two men who slept in the room after situations, as they were out of employ - they found no situations were wanted. As he was going out I sent the servant up to see if all was safe, and as he went out, she said the sheets were gone. I ran after him, but lost him - he was taken that day.</p>

            . On the 1st of December, I saw the prisoners driving the pigs at the top of Union-place, Stepney-green - they wanted to turn them towards Mile End-road. I saw Mrs. Paget putting the fire out, and told her I had seen two men driving the pigs. I ran towards the White Horse, public-house, and saw the two pigs in the Mile End-road - Fuller was with them then. He said he knew they were Mrs. Pagett's, and he was going to take them home.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About ten minutes after eight o'clock I heard a disturbance, and went to the prosecutrix. She produced the two men to me, and said Fuller had been taking the pigs, and told me to take him to the watch-house - he said nobody else was concerned with him. Next day he said Rayner and Bree were with him, and said where they lived; the Magistrate discharged Bree. Fuller said they meant to have had the pigs a week before.</p>

            . Fuller was brought to the watch-house, and charged with driving the pigs from the house - he denied it, but Mayon and others said he was one of them. I asked him who the others were? but he said nobody was with him, and he was not the person. He said he was going to buy a hat, that he had been to Bethnal-green, and was going to Pagett's to tell her son about some work. I asked him what direction he went from Bethnal-green to Pagett's? He said he turned round by Langley's, the builder. Next day, before his mother, myself, and the coachman, he owned it, and said Jemmy and Dick were with him; he took us, and shewed us where to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181912010090"/>find Rayner - I took him. Fuller stood by, and said that was him; Rayner struggled to get from the watchman. I secured him, and afterwards took Bree, but the witnesses could not identify Bree.</p>
               <p>FULLER'S Defence. I overheard two men say that Dempsey, in the Commercial-road, wanted men, and thought I would go and tell Pagett's son. As we were crossing the road we saw the pigs there, and were taking them home to Pagett's; the people said we were not to go off so easy. Rayner being frightened ran away.</p>
               <p>RAYNER'S Defence. I met Fuller in crossing the road, and we ran after the pigs.</p>
