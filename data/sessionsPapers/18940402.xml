I have been wearing it for months past"—I said "Where did you get it from?"—he said, "I bought it some time ago of a gentleman that has gone abroad"—I said, "What is his name?"—he said, "We don't ask gentlemen their names when we buy a coat of them"—I said, "How long is it ago?"—he said, "It might be four, it might be six, months ago"—I asked him again, twice over, whether he could not give me any other account of it—he said, "No"—I said, "I shall charge you with stealing and receiving this coat from the City Arms, St. Mary Axe, yesterday afternoon"—he said, "I have got the diarrhoea. I want to go in the back garden closet"—I said, "You can go, but I will go with you"—he went to the back garden, and I went with him—he did not go to the closet—he said, "Do you mean to say you are going to take me?"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Then it will take a dozen b—like you to take me"—I caught hold of him; he began to struggle very violently—as we took him through his house his wife and three other women (his daughters, I believe) were there—one got hold round my neck, another held my legs; the prisoner kicked me in the stomach; we got him in the street; he bit Shepherd in the wrist—he was taken to the station—he made no reply to the</p>

I am a mechanical engineer, of 36, Lime Street—I act as liquidator of the Patent Lock Sash Factory at Dalston—the prisoner was in my employment, with his son and a person named Sansom—on 14th March, in consequence of information, I went to the works at Dalston, and looking under the casting machine there was a hole—I reached my hand in, and felt a parcel done up in newspaper—I took it out, and laid it on a bench, and a person in my employ opened it while I went to a desk, in which I found six or eight of these taps—I took them up and put all the tools together, and came away from the factory, locking it up—I sent the prisoner to Millwall—on his return to the office I called in Mr. Lawler, and said to the prisoner, "Harry, how can you account for these taps?"—after looking at them a minute he said, "It is no use my telling lies, I stole them"—the prisoner came to, the office for the purpose of taking instructions from me, to take messages and clean up tools—in doing so he would not have to pass the place where these tools were kept—he would only have to go where he was sent—I have a right to use the cellar where Mr. Lawler keeps things, but the prisoner would not go there.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> These tools are not in complete sets—they are kept in sets; but in putting a hand in you could only take out what you could reach—I had a communication about these things from a person, not from Brookbank—the desk in which these taps were found is a place</p>

                  </hi>. I am a mechanic, employed by Mr. Spear at Lime Street and at Dalston—about a fortnight previous to 15th March, I was at the works at Dalston, and saw the prisoner standing by the engine—he aroused my suspicion by his glancing over to where I was, looking rather suspiciously—after he had gone out, I went to see what there was under the engine, and then I found these spanners—I first told my sister about this in confidence, and then I told Mr. Brookbank, a friend of mine, and Mr. Spear heard of it from him—these spanners were in a dark place under the engine—I was friendly with the prisoner.</p>

Benson, jewellers, of Ludgate Hill—on February 17th, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner came in and asked to see some diamond horseshoe pins about £8 or £10—I produced two trays of pins; there was not one there he liked—he wanted one like his father bought some years ago with four stones on one side and three on the other—I said I could make one for him—I left him, to speak to another assistant, and he said, "Very well, I will leave you the order"—the other assistant came up with the loose stones, and he said that they would do—I asked if he would leave a deposit—he said, "Yes," and gave me 5s. in the name of Mitchell, 18, Russell Square—after he left we missed a diamond cluster from the same tray—</p>

I did not go into the George; I am not a teetotaler.

                  </hi>. I am a married woman; I have been living apart from my husband four or five years—I have known the prisoner about eighteen months—I made his acquaintance when we were in the same employment, at the King's Head Public-house, in Brewer Street, Piccadilly—he was a billiard marker there—we both left there together about ten months ago—I went and lived at 11, Alfred Place, with the prisoner, in the name of Collins—after leaving the situation in Brewer Street I got another situation at the Old King's Head, at the corner of Hampstead Road, on 5th March—I stayed there about six months—after that I took up my abode at 11, Alfred Place—I did not live with him there, but he visited me there—I was there four weeks; up to 13th March—he knew I was married—he did not approve of my going into the bar at the King's Head—he remained in his employment an a billiard marker in Brewer Street—he has been in the same situation seventeen years, and has a very good character, very much respected by everyone—on Saturday, 3rd March, I was spending the evening with friends, and did not get home till about one, or soon after—at that time I was living by myself—someone walked home with me that night—when I got to the house I saw the prisoner at the door—he asked me who I had been with, and I told him—he said if he had seen us he would have gone for the two of us—on Tuesday morning, the 6th, the prisoner came into the bar at the Bull's Head—he said I was looking very bad, and he was very sorry, and he told me he was awfully fond of me, and said he would never hurt me—he asked me if Arthur had been to see me—I said "No" (Arthur is the gentleman who had walked home with me)—he stayed about an hour on that occasion—he had a brandy and soda—he then left the bar; he bade me good-bye, and said he should not return—he left from about half-past ten to eleven—after dinner, about half-past two or a quarter to three, on going into the bar, I saw the prisoner in front of the bar speaking to two customers; I don't know who they were; I was attending to my work—after the two persons left the prisoner came up to the counter in front of where I was, and he placed a revolver on the counter, and momently it went off—I think the revolver came from his pocket, but I am not sure—it did come from his right-hand pocket, I suppose—the revolver was pointed past me; I don't think the bullet would have struck me; I could not exactly say the direction of it, it was towards me—he said, "Look"—I don't know if he intended to show it me or not—I said, "Oh! Charlie, don't do anything rash"—as I said that I felt a ringing in my ears—I put my hands up to my head, and the bullet went through my shoulder—as soon as the report took place my master, Mr. Thompson, came into the bar—the prisoner said, "It is all right, I don't want to hurt anyone"—I said, "Why did you do it?"—he said, "I could not help it, I love you so much"—at that time blood was coming from my wound—I don't know exactly what I said—of course, he was very kind to me—I put my hand to my shoulder, and saw blood on my hand—a constable came in, and the revolver was taken from him—I was taken to the hospital, and the</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant X</hi>). On December 28th I made this plan (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) of the ground floor front room of 10, Steel Road—it is made to scale; I also produce tracings of the same—at the time I made the plan there were blood stains nearly under the window, partly under the table, and partly under the bed, a few inches—a large quantity had run towards the centre of the room—in another part of the room, between the arm chair and the fender, was another large pool of blood, and there were several smaller patches between that pool and the door—there were spots of blood on the valance of the bed and on the washstand—that was all I particularly noticed.</p>

                  </hi> (197 <hi rend="italic">X</hi>). On 27th December, at 5.45 a.m., I took the prisoner to Willesden Cottage Hospital—I arrived there at 7.20—after his throat had been dressed I noticed that his hands and arms were covered with blood—he had a tolerable sized bump on the centre of his forehead; the skin was not broken—I said to him, "I suppose you know all about it?"—he said, "Oh, yes; I returned home at 8.30 the night previous; she came home at 11.30. We had a bit of a row, and she struck me on the head with the tongs. I held her down on the bed to get the tongs away from her, and the blood from my head went all over the front of her body. She went to sleep in the chair all night; I only had about an hour and a half's sleep. At 4.30 I saw her sitting in the chair, with her throat cut; she fell backwards while in the chair, into the basin I had washed my hands in. She holloaed out, 'Jim and Mrs. Bell, come here.' I ran upstairs, and when I saw what she had done I took and got hold of the knife and cut my own throat"—this knife, he told me, lay on the right-hand side of her, but I have not got that in my notes—he said, "God Almighty knows what she done hers with."</p>

                  </hi>, M.D. I am divisional surgeon of the X Division—between five and six on the morning of 27th December I was called to No. 10, Steel Road—I examined the prisoner; he was lying on his back, on the floor, with his feet towards me—he had a wound on the right side of his neck; it was a considerable wound, but no important vessels were cut; it was not bleeding when I saw it, it had ceased—I saw this knife on the floor; the wound might have been produced by it, and might have been self-inflicted—there was a considerable pool of blood just below the wound; it was not continuous from the place where his arms were; the pool was in an irregular circle—I did not notice any blood on his arms or hands at that time—I then examined the woman—she was lying on her back, slightly tilted towards the left side, but practically on her back, stretched out—she was lying parallel with the bed, with the feet towards the foot of the bed—I saw the fragments of an earthenware pan just appearing from under her skirt, below her waist—she was dead—I saw a wound on the left side of her neck; there was a large pool of blood immediately under the wound—there was no blood on her from the neck to the waist—she had on a white under-garment, what women call a bodice, I believe—I did not open the dress—two days afterwards I made a post-mortem examination, and dissected the wound—the effectual wound was a deep wound,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404020031"/>
               <p>extending from the windpipe backwards four inches and a half—it was deepest behind, deepest near the spine, near the backbone, shallowing off towards the windpipe, but remaining at its maximum depth, two inches and a half, from its course forward, and its depth was down to the bone, through all the soft parts; it then sloped up rapidly forward, just touch<lb/>ing the common carotid artery—the sheath of the artery was nicked, and it then just grazed or scratched the windpipe—that was the main or effectual wound; but from the windpipe towards the right side it was continued by a fine, long shallow skin cut, for two inches, terminating in a fine point—the boundary of the main wound behind was blunt and irregularly round—the point of the knife as it plunged down touched the spinus process of the backbone—the movement of the knife was evidently from behind, forward, and the wound went down at once to its full depth, to the spinus process, and not merely inwards and downwards, but back<lb/>wards, so that the upper parts of the wound slightly overhung the lower parts; in fact, it was like an overhanging cliff—her hands were open and also flaccid, with no tension about them—the wound seems to have begun with something like a stab, and after running along to two inches and a half to its maximum depth, it ends as a cut—I do not think that the facts I observed are compatible with the hypothesis of suicide—in all probability, at the time the wound was inflicted she was lying as I found her, on her back; also, as I would have expected, blood ran down her front from the neck—if she had been sitting in a chair when her throat was cut I should have expected to have found blood on her front—it is not possible to say within an hour or two how long she had been dead; it might have been two hours or so; that would be the maximum—I noticed the bed; it was prepared for entrance, but had not been occupied—it was entirely smooth, neatly prepared; there was no pressure on the pillow or sheet, and no sign of any sort whatever—I noticed the blood on the stairs—I heard the description given by the inspector; we examined the stairs together with a candle—his description was just what I have now given, but, in addition, I found about thirteen tiny spots of blood on the right-hand side, going up, and two or three on the landing at the top, but no little pool of blood at the top against the land-lady's door, and no blood down the middle of the staircase; none on the right-hand side, coming down—the spots were fresh and liquid; they had formed evidently as drops, and then formed spots and spread—there were no spurts or jets; they were not spots that were consistent with the hypothesis of having come from the prisoner's throat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I gave evidence before the Coroner—since then I have had the advantage of a consultation with Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Burgess—I exclude altogether the possibility of suicide—I have always been of that opinion; I swore that before the Coroner—the Coroner's Jury returned an open verdict—I say that the facts I observed are not compatible with suicide—I said before the Magistrate, "I think the wounds on the woman highly improbable, and not at all likely to have been inflicted by herself"—I adopt that answer to-day; it correctly represents my opinion, if you take it with what I have said to-day and what I said before the Coroner—I did not say before the Coroner, "I think the facts may mean suicide, and also homicide"—the fact of the hands being open would show that <hi rend="italic">rigor mortis</hi> had not set in; they were flaccid, loose—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404020032"/>
               <p>I say, in all probability, she must have been in a recumbent position at the time the wound was inflicted—I infer that from the fact that there was no blood in front—the wound came from behind, forwards, and also from left to right—suicidal wounds are usually from left to right—if she inflicted the wound herself, I should expect her to fall forward—it is highly improbable that she would fall backward—if she did I should not expect to find blood in front; the hand being drawn away might bring blood with it—I did not make a full post-mortem of the body; I dissected the wound—I did not make any examination of the other organs—I had not heard that she had been attending a hospital—I have not had any case of homicide by cutting a throat before this—I have had many cases of suicide by cutting the throat—the deceased was about five feet five inches in height—there were no marks of violence except on the throat; there were no signs of a struggle about her—death must have been almost instantaneous—I have no doubt that the wound in the prisoner's throat was self-inflicted—the wound began about the middle of the neck, from before, backwards—I did not take especial note of his wound, I was very glad to get him away to the hospital—the spots of blood on the staircase were about the size of a threepenny piece; they were uniformly separate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I stated before the Coroner that the facts I observed in the first instance seemed ambiguous; that is, they seemed to point two ways, but one of those ways I found to be impossible; that was the way of suicide—I expressed substantially the same opinion before the Magistrate—I expressed that opinion before I had any consultation with Dr. Stevenson.</p>

                  </hi>, M. D. I am Lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence at Guy's Hospital—I have been in Court during the trial of this case—I have heard the whole of the evidence—taking into consideration the position of the woman, I think it highly improbable that the wound was self-inflicted—that opinion is formed from the character of the wound, its situation, and the situation of the woman, as found immediately, and the state of the blood—if the woman had cut her throat while sitting in a chair I should expect to find blood in front of the body, unless she was leaning very far back in the chair, and then I should expect to find it on the chair—I should not expect her to fall backward flat on the floor if she was sitting in the chair; she might remain sitting in the chair, or she might drop oft' on one side—if she was standing at the time I should expect her to fall all in a heap; or forwards—she might fall back-wards if she leant very far back to do it—I have seen a person drop dead, and suddenly found; according to my experience they may always be expected to drop forward, the centre of gravity contributing to that—I entirely agree with Dr. Gibson as to the wound being in the nature of a stab at first; that is to say that the weapon, by whatever hand wielded, had been driven in, and then drawn along—having regard to all the appearances, I should judge that, in all probability, the woman must have been in a recumbent position when the wound was inflicted.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, practising at Harlesden—I saw the prisoner after his admission to the Cottage Hospital, on 27th December; he was suffering from a wound in the throat—on the 29th I found he was suffering from influenza, and on the 30th from typhoid fever—on his admission I noticed on the right side of the head a swelling about the size of a two-shilling piece, with an incision about half to three-quarters of an inch long oh the top of it—that had bled—that was a wound that might have been produced by a blunt instrument, such as a pair of tongs or fire irons—his right cheek-bone was bruised, and the top of the skull was very tender.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The bruise and marks were quite recent, apparently about the same time as the wound in the throat—the time of incubation in typhoid is three weeks—on the 26th he must have been suffering from influenza, and from typhoid within three days—there were no spots on the skin—he must have been in a high state of fever.</p>

I am Florence Stevenson's sister—we saw an advertisement on a Royal Music Hall programme, in consequence of which we went to I, Catherine Street, Strand, towards the end of August, 1891—outside the house was a board: "George E. Bishop, Theatrical and Music Hall Agent"—we went upstairs, and saw the prisoner on the first floor</p>

               <p>—we told him why we had come, and asked his terms—he told us ten guineas—we said we could not pay the money down, but we could by instalments—he suggested we should pay half-a-guinea a week—for ten guineas he was to teach us step dancing, elocution, singing, the art of making up; give us six original songs, and procure us an engagement—he promised then to procure us an engagement—we went away and came again on 14th September, and this is the agreement I signed in the stage name I intended to take, Rosa Montagu—the prisoner and his manager, too, I believe, signed it in my presence—I called his attention to the fact that there was nothing in the agreement about procuring an engagement, and then the prisoner wrote in that he would procure it—I paid him ten shillings and sixpence, for which he gave me a receipt—I continued going three times a week till January or February, 1892—he said at first he would get us an engagement for Drury Lane Pantomime for Christmas, and he said it would give us stage experience if we went on the stage as an extra in a pantomime; and he intended to get us a music-hall engagement after that—the prisoner gave me four original songs, written by himself—I had dancing lessons, which lasted at most ten minutes at a time—Maud Hawthorne, his step-daughter, taught us that for the first fortnight—the prisoner played the piano himself for the first week, and then a young French girl played it afterwards—I had no real singing lessons; we only used to sing the songs, and the prisoner played the tune of it—he did not teach us elocution, or how to make up—he promised to bring me out—he said he was going to give a concert at an Athenaeum, in the Tottenham Court Road, and was going to bring out about a dozen of his pupils, and he advised me to get my dress ready, and pay for the band parts of the songs—I paid fifteen shillings for the band parts, and bought the material of the costumes, and had them made up—he introduced a dressmaker to me—I believed I was coming out at the Athenaeum—the prisoner called me in his office, and asked me what Mr. Graham had been saying, and I told him; Mr. Graham told all the girls that he was only a swindler, and was doing us girls out of our money, and he was not an authorised agent at all, and not known at the music-halls—the prisoner had told me he was an accredited agent—I paid £30 altogether for dresses; that includes the ten guineas—I got no engagement in pantomime or anywhere—the prisoner left, and went to 82, Waterloo Road; I continued my lessons there—I paid my last instalment at the end of January, or the beginning of February, 1892, before he left Catherine Street—some time after he left Waterloo Road; he did not tell us that he was going, or where he was going; we went to our lessons one day, and found he had gone—some time after in 1893 I found out he was in Kennington Road—each time I went there, and gave my name, they said he was not at home—I never found him there—I never went to the Strand office.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 47, Kenton Street, Brunswick Square, and am the wife of Reuben Thomas Stevenson, and the sister of the last witness—in August, 1891, I saw an advertisement in the name of Bishop on a Royal Music Hall programme—I went and saw him, and asked his terms for music-hall tuition—he said his terms were ten guineas for each pupil—I agreed to pay by instalments of half-a-guinea a week—he was to teach us step dancing, elocution, deportment, make up, six original songs, and procure us an engagement—I am sure elocution was mentioned—my sister asked him about the engagement, and he said "Yes"; and she said, "I would rather you wrote it down on the agreement," and he did so—I paid my first instalment and signed the agreement on that day—the prisoner wrote in the words "procure an engagement" on the agreement—I went three times a week for tuition—Mr. Romaine gave us step dancing lessons first—the prisoner did nothing towards the tuition—we took lessons at Waterloo Road after he moved there in Christmas, 1891—my last instalment was paid on 9th February, 1892—these are the receipts which the prisoner gave me—the last one is dated February 9th—we asked him when we first went if he could get us into a pantomime, and he promised to do so—he said his usual fee for an engagement in pantomime was ten shillings, but as we were his pupils he would not charge us anything—in March, 1892, he disappeared from Waterloo Road—I next saw him in the Kennington Road—I went there three times, and he was out—when I saw him, and asked him what he was going to do with the money I had paid him, he said, "Let it go a little while; come again in October"—I went in October, and he said, "Get some photographs"—I got some photographs—he said, "Come again in three weeks"—I went then, and found he had moved a fortnight before, and left no address—I next saw him in the Strand at the beginning of this year—I asked him what he was going to do—he said, "I don't know"—I said, "What are you going to do about the money I have paid you?"—he said, "I cannot do anything for you"—I said, "Why not?"—he said, "I don't wish to insult you, but I cannot get you anything to do"—I said, "Very well," and came away—that was the last I saw of him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now undergoing a sentence of im<lb/>prisonment passed on me here on February 7th this year for fraud in connection with a theatrical agency—about the end of 1891 or the begin<lb/>ning of 1892, I saw an advertisement in a paper, and in consequence I went and saw the prisoner at 1, Catherine Street, Strand, and told him I wanted to go on the stage—he said "Yes," I had a good face and a good square jaw, which was a good thing among music-hall artists; it was well known it gave them a good cut—he asked me ten guineas—I said I could not afford it, it would be too much, and ultimately he came down to £7 10s.—for that I was to get elocution, stage deportment, step dancing, and three or six original songs and melodies, and engagements—I asked him if he included procuring engagements—he said, "Yes"—he took me into a room and showed me portraits on the wall—he said they were old pupils, and two or three were people who taught for him—I went to him on 23rd February, and signed this agreement, and paid him £5 on account for music-hall training—this is the receipt he gave me—on 29th February I went again and paid £2 10s., the balance—he gave me this receipt—before I signed the agreement I said I should like to do something after Charles Godfrey's style, character and descriptive work—before this I had been employed by Mr. Potter, at Wimpole Street, as his cashier—when I signed the agreement I left his employment—after 29th February I went to Catherine Street for lessons—sometimes I had them, sometimes I had none, because there was no one there to give them to me—I had dancing and singing lessons; I had no elocution lessons—I got the verses of two songs by degrees; sometimes two or three weeks would elapse between the verses—I got the beginning of a third song three or four months after-wards—after I had been there about four months, I called one day when the prisoner was out, and after that I received a telegram to meet him at the Hercules Tavern—I went, and he asked me to lend him £10, as he was in a little financial difficulty—he said he would repay me—I asked him if he would get me an engagement, and that was really why I lent him the money, because he promised to get me something to do—I had not got £10 at that time, but I let him have it shortly afterwards—he gave me a bill of exchange for it—he did not pay me back the money when the bill</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Asking her to call, and stating that she would find him a straightforward and Honourable man.

                  </hi>. I lived at 20, Anerley Road, Shepherd's Bush, in 1893—I am of no occupation at present—I am eighteen next June—in January, 1893, I saw an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Daily Telegraphy</hi> and I wrote to Mr. Bishop—I got in reply, "Practical Hints to Aspirants," and a prospectus—I read a part, in which he said that if at the end of a month it was evident that the student was not adapted for the profession, a portion of the money would be returned—Mr. Jordan was my guardian—I received this letter from the prisoner. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had written to Mr. Jordan, telling him the total cost would be thirty pounds, ten guineas his fees, and the rest to be spent on stage clothes, band parts, make up, etc.</hi>)—I had had a conversation with him before that; he said the charge would be £30, which included ten guineas for unlimited tuition, and twenty guineas for outfit—after that I went to my guardian's office; the prisoner was present—he told my guardian it would cost £30—I was to take ordinary music-hall business—£30 was paid—on 13th April I signed an agreement with the prisoner—there was an undertaking in it to procure me an engagement when proficient—about a week after I went, and began to receive lessons in dancing and singing—the prisoner taught me singing, and Will Granville dancing—I had three songs given to me—for a short time I went regularly three times a week—occa<lb/>sionally, all through that summer, the prisoner put my lessons off, by letter or telegram, from time to time—when I asked him to get me an engagement he said he would see about it; he was giving a students' concert, and I was to appear at it—he asked me to send in a stage name—that concert never took place, to my knowledge—the only part of a costume I had was a pair of dancing shoes—the piano dis<lb/>appeared from Kennington Road; I understood it was for rates and taxes, I did not know—the prisoner said I was getting on very well in dancing—he never got me an engagement; he said he would get me one when I was proficient—he never said whether I was proficient.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had three different songs—I went to Kennington Road to learn them—I was perfectly satisfied with the progress I was making—I did not attend regularly in the hot weather last year; illness prevented me from coming—I received a communication from you asking me to come—I called at the Strand office on Tuesday, 29th January, and said I would resume on the following Monday; I could not come on that day—no definite time was fixed when I was to have the dresses—I expected to have them as soon as the money was laid out for them—I do not consider they were necessary for practice—when I asked for them you kept putting me off—I received in all a fair number of lessons—after the piano was seized for rates at Kennington you hummed the melodies of my songs to me—I had no music for my dancing lessons at first—I did not expect you to get me an engagement before I was qualified to take one; I expected it at the end of my training.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">The letter stated that the piano would be sold on Monday evening, and asked her to help him as far as she could, as he wanted to buy it in if possible; but not to discontinue her lessons if she could not help him</hi>)—the piano was seized—I lent him £2 10s.—he wrote again on 19th October asking for help—I did not lend him any more/—after I had lent him the £2 10s.

On March 19th, about nine p.m., I saw Taylor in Homerton, and told him I was a police officer, and I found, he had been dealing with pipes, the proceeds of warehouse breaking on 13th of last month, and I was going to take him to his apart<lb/>ments and search him—Mr. Rag was with me—we searched the prisoner's apartments at 1a, Church Road, Homerton, and found nine and a half dozen pipes in the original boxes, which Mr. Rag identified—the prisoner said nothing—I said, "You had best tell the truth," and he made a statement—I went to 36, Windsor Terrace, where Babb had apartments, about 12.45 a.m. on the 20th, and saw Babb come home with his wife—he was just about to open the door; I said, "Babb," and he turned round</p>

               <p>and recognised me, and said, "Good God, have mercy on me!"—I said, "Go inside; don't make any bother here. I am going to search your apartments"—Taylor and Mr. Rag were with me—we went upstairs, and I found ninety-one boxes, each containing one dozen pipes, which Mr. Rag identified, and in a black bag under the bed I found forty-seven new telephone receivers—I said, "Babb, these are valuable; how do you account for having them in your possession?"—he said, "The same person brought them who brought the pipes"—he had said that the pipes were brought to the house by a man named Felstead—I knew who Felstead was—I then took Babb in custody, and conveyed both prisoners to Moor Lane Police-station and searched them—I found on Taylor this letter, which I read, and said to Babb, "This is a letter from you to Taylor"—I knew his writing, and it was signed "Charley"—he said, "Let me look at it"—I allowed him to do so, and he said, "Quite true." (<hi rend="italic">Letter read</hi>: "Dear William,—Enclosed find ticket for the parcel at Broad Street cloak-room. Do your best this week with what you have, and we might have a big week next week. I have had the offer of £5 of goods for next week. If you cannot sell the frames let me know, and I may be able to sell them myself to a party. I must sell the frames by Saturday evening at the latest, as the party who is going to let me have the £5 will be able to let me have them on Saturday. I expect he will want a big sum. Has my friend, Mr. Baker, been to see the overmantle yet?—Yours, <hi rend="smallCaps">CHARLEY</hi> ")—on March 22nd I returned to Babb's—the premises had not been in the possession of the police—I found twenty-four photo frames, nine metal ornaments, and a flower stand—the telephone receivers were identified by Mr. Phillips, the manager of the National Telephone Company—they bore the company's name and number on them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 31, Dunbar Road, Forest Gate—the prisoner is my husband—I was married to him on 15th November, 1881—he was then a widower, with three children, and I was the mother of eight children by the prisoner's half-brother; he was a solicitor in the City of London; he died in January, 1880, leaving me some property—the prisoner and I did not live peaceably together; there were several applica<lb/>tions to the Police-courts, on the both sides—I filed a petition in the Divorce Court for a judicial separation—I separated from him several times—before October, 1891, there were two deeds of separation between us, in which Messrs. G. R. Brown and Co., solicitors, acted for me—it was Mr. Brown who attended to my business; he died three or four years ago—I never saw Mr. Jacobs till after Mr. Brown's death, then Mr. Jacobs attended to my business—in October, 1891, I entered into an agreement with the prisoner to settle some proceedings that were pending for a separa<lb/>tion; I believe it was to go into Court to get a separation and allowance. (<hi rend="italic">Mr. Jacobs here produced certain documents</hi>)—I remember signing this document—my husband also signed it in presence of Mr. Jacobs (<hi rend="italic">This was dated 29th October</hi>, 1891)—I saw Mr. Jacobs sign it—it was read over in his office in my husband's presence; he was quite sober then—some time after that I got an allowance from my husband; it was not always paid regularly—I applied to Mr. Jacobs, and he paid me—I lived with my husband till November last year—I think that was the last time—I had not separated from him, I had written to say that I wished to leave him—he left me—he went away at the end of March last year, and left me at Forest Gate and went to Highgate—we did live together, because I used to go with him to Gravesend—I met him at Liverpool Street, and went with him to Gravesend; the last time was about November or December—I am almost sure it was the end of November—I left him at Liverpool Street Station; we did not part on friendly terms, because he had been drinking, and was very violent, and I thought I had better go home, as his son was not there to meet him—some time after that I went to see Mr. Jacobs, and appointments were made for me to meet my husband at Mr. Jacobs' office—I did not keep any of those appointments before 10th January—I think I once went to the office, and my husband was not there—he sent a telegram to say he could not come—on 10th January I went to Mr. Jacobs'office with my daughter Laura, not the prisoner's daughter—I got there about five minutes to twelve—I stopped a few minutes in the clerks' office—my husband went into Mr. Jacobs' room at the same time as I did—I sat in the second chair from the door; my husband sat near the safe, in the first chair nearer the door, side by side with me—Mr. Jacobs was sitting at his desk and there was no one else in the room but us three—my husband took the first chair and drew it in front of the door, and said, "This woman has robbed me," and he went over to Mr. Jacobs, and then I saw a pistol in his hand, and I screamed "Murder!" and ran across the room and opened the door—I found it was locked; I turned the key, it was in</p>

               <p>the door, and I got out of the room—before I got out I heard a report and was shot in my back as I was trying to open the door—I heard no report before that—when I got outside I saw my husband standing in Ironmonger Lane—he appeared to be very sober—I know his handwriting—this document (<hi rend="italic">marked J</hi>) is his writing, it is signed F. H. C. Lindus—those initials look a little different writing to what I have seen; the body is his writing—I received this document dated 25th December; that is his writing. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "25th December, 1893. Mrs. Lindus—I shall be at Jacobs' office on Wednesday at three, according to the arrangement, and it is an understood thing you are to bring Wallie with you, for me to see him and wish him good-bye. Jacobs wrote you to that effect. C. E. Lindus.")—my husband had at times given way to drink ever since we have been married—there are two children by our marriage living: Harold, eight last August, and Walter, five last October—he is commonly called Wallie—I also had a still born—child two years ago last November.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> Ever since our marriage my husband has constantly given way to drink to excess, and there have been differences between us, and Police-court proceedings at different times—the last Police-court proceedings were at Worthing four or five years ago—that was before the last settlement of October, 1891—there was a petition in the Divorce Court, filed by myself, for a judicial separation; it was that that led up to the execution of the settlement in October, 1891—that petition was withdrawn by me at my husband's request—after that settlement we lived together as man and wife, and so continued down to March last year at Dunbar Road, Forest Gate—he then went to live at Southminster, that is some miles from Forest Gate—after that I met him from time to time at Liverpool Street Station, and went and spent some time with him at Gravesend, sometimes from Friday to Monday—the last time we were at Gravesend he was very kind to me, but not times before—the last time was at the end of November or beginning of December, 1893—on Wednesday, the 10th January, at Liverpool Street Station, he was rather cross; he used some bad expressions to me—he had been drinking very heavily, and I left him and went home—he came down to see me at Forest Gate in December; with that exception I did not see him until 10th January—nothing that I know of had occurred to alter his feeling towards me in the meantime—I should say there had been three or four appointments to meet at Mr. Jacobs' office, which he had not kept—I never noticed that he suffered from sleeplessness, only when he had been drinking he would wake up with his head had; and some years ago, when he had tooth-ache, I believe he lived with his eldest son at Southminster—he had a brother, Geo. Frederick D. Lindus—I never saw him, I heard of him—I do not know that he died insane; I know he was in a workhouse—I did not know that he was confined there as a lunatic—I did not know that in October last my husband was making arrangements for his own funeral, or that he was giving directions with regard to the disposal of his body—I never heard it—I never con<lb/>sulted a medical man about the state of my husband's mind; I have only complained to my doctor when he attended me in my confinement—I complained of his ill-usage to me—I never said that I should like him examined as to his mental condition—I have never been to Southminster</p>

               <p>—from March to December I have slept with him at Dunbar Street, and also at Gravesend—he came to me at Forest Gate since his last outbreak of temper, but he did not sleep there—he always used to go to bed early when he had been drinking—he had periodical outbreaks of drink—when not in drink he was all right—our quarrels were principally because he would not provide food for the family—in October, 1891, my children by his half-brother did not live with me at Dunbar Street—the daughter did, for a little time—he did not object to that—he sanctioned her coming to assist me in the house—his eldest son was seventeen last November—I have never stated to him that I did not think my husband was in his right mind—I don't remember saying that—I don't remember ever making such a statement—I would rather leave it so—I do not remember saying to Mr. Ford, clerk to the prisoners solicitor in October, 1891, that I thought my husband was wrong in his head—I remember travelling with Mr. Ford to Ports<lb/>mouth—I do not remember saying anything like that to him on the journey; if you please I will leave it there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in partnership with Mr. Miller, carrying on the profession in the name of G. R. Brown and Co., at 3, Church Court, Old Jewry—Mr. Brown died on 4th July, 1891; prior to that date he attended to Mrs. Lindus' business in the office—I had nothing to do with it up to the time of his death, after that I attended to it—in reference to the deed of October. 1891, I saw the prisoner and also Mrs. Lindus at times separately, and afterwards together—I acted for Mrs. Lindus alone up to October—Mr. Bicknell acted for the prisoner—I saw Mr. Bicknell and his clerk with reference to the matter—the trust, deed was settled between Mr. Bicknell and myself—it was not completely settled—I had a meeting with Mr. Bicknell and Mr. and Mrs. Lindus at my office on 13th October, 1891—it was arranged that I should prepare the trust deed, and send Mr. Bicknell the draft, which I subsequently did—the 13th October was the first time I had seen the prisoner with his solicitor—we might have been together an hour—I saw him next, I think, on 22nd October, when he came to me with his wife, and requested me to act for both of them, and on 28th October the deed was signed—there is not the slightest question that on those occasions he was in his right mind—he was a business-like man—he purchased the investments that were settled, and brought me the broker's receipts, and acted in a business-like manner—up to the time of the execution of the deed, neither Mr. Bicknell or his clerk suggested that he was out of his mind—I never heard of such a suggestion till after the shooting—Mrs. Lindus consulted me from time to time after the deed was executed, and I saw the prisoner many times in relation to their affairs—I never called the prisoner's attention to his wife's complaint of his abusive language at Liverpool Street Station—I left them to settle their differences as well as</p>

               <p>they could—an appointment was made for 12th December, on a notice he had received from his wife that she would no longer live with him—he came, and said he desired to see her, and to say good-bye—that appoint<lb/>ment was broken by a telegram from him—on 18th December he called again—he then said that he could not stop in town, but he fixed another appointment for 27th December—he came on that day, but Mrs. Lindus did not—he then fixed the 29th, and asked me to communicate with his wife—she did not come—on 1st January the prisoner called again—I told him that his wife had been to see me the day before, and said she did not wish to meet him again, and if he would settle matters with me, she was willing to make any reasonable arrangement with reference to the children, the two children by their marriage—he said that he must see her, and he would discuss nothing with me unless she was present, and we made a further appointment for 10th January—he said if she did not come, we would go to Forest Gate—I did not promise to go to Forest Gate—on the 10th I got to my office a little before eleven—I found the prisoner in the outer office—I wished him good morning, and asked him into my room, and shook hands with him—he said, "Are you coming to Forest Gate?"—I said, "Mrs. Lindus was here on Monday, and I have arranged for her to be here at twelve o'clock"—he said, "There is an hour to spare, and I shall go out for a little while"—he appeared perfectly quiet and business-like—before he returned Mrs. Lindus came in at twelve, and they were announced together; Mrs. Lindus entered first, he came in a minute afterwards—my brother let him in, and went out and closed the door—Mrs. Lindus took her usual seat, the second from the safe; I was sitting at my desk—I invited the prisoner to take a seat; instead of sitting down, he took the back of a chair with his right hand, and drew it round in front of the door, and then leaned over and locked the door—I saw him do that—he then rose up slowly from his chair, with his right hand still on the chair, and commenced a speech, apparently as though he was speaking in the direction of his wife, as if he was going to give her a lecture—I don't remember fully what he said; it was something about "that woman at Penge, and settlement"—while he was speaking Mrs. Lindus shrieked; I sprang up in my chair; the prisoner turned towards me; I saw a flash, a smoke, and heard a report—he shot me in the right breast—I saw that Mrs. Lindus had been shot, and I was at the same time looking for some instrument for protection—I saw Mrs. Lindus at the door with her hand upon the key, and I saw the prisoner with a pistol, pointed to her back, smoke and flash, and heard the report—at the same time I seized an account-book with my left hand, leaned over my desk and broke the glass of the sliding panel with my right, and then seized another account-book and turned round to the prisoner, who at the same moment stood before me endeavouring to take aim again—e were a few seconds in that position when the door flew open, and my brother Albert rushed in with the clerk Zabell—Albert seized the prisoner by the collar, and drove him against the mantelpiece—I turned to assist him—Albert was grasping the prisoner's hands, in one of which was a pistol—the prisoner again turned the pistol upon me—I felt that I was bleeding internally, and thought I was dying, and I went to the office to get assist<lb/>ance and left the house—I was taken to the hospital, and remained there</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> At the interview on January 1st the prisoner said that if Mrs. Lindus did not come on the 12th we were to go down to Forest Gate—I instructed my clerk to make an entry in my diary—the diary is not here—the entry was not for Forest Gate at twelve, it was "Lindus at twelve," no mention of Forest Gate—when he came on the 10th I told him that I had seen Mrs. Lindus on the Monday, and had arranged that the meeting should take place at my office that day at twelve—he never complained in any way of my conduct as his solicitor—the settlement was made with his sanction and that of Mr. Bicknell—a modification was made at the prisoner's own suggestion; the draft was prepared on the terms arranged—it is a complete misconception that, there was anything fraudulent in it, or that the prisoner was drunk when he signed it, or that there was any persuasion to induce him to sign it—he had used no threat towards me prior to January 10th—as far as my efforts were concerned they were made on behalf of all the parties whose interests were entrusted to my care—I have brought an action for libel against the prisoner in relation to the letters that are produced, asserting the contents of them to be absolutely untrue, and have assessed the damages at £3,000—I have also an action on account of the personal injuries received on this occasion, damages £3,000—both those actions are down for trial, one of them in the near future—my brother and Zabell came in almost immediately, while the prisoner was endeavouring to take a second aim at me—the whole thing was momentary—when I left the room the revolver was in his hand, and my brother was holding his wrist.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined. Q.</hi> What was the modification in the deed which the prisoner suggested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Originally the settlement was to have been on Mrs. Lindus' life, estate, and her two children, but about three weeks after the deed had been executed Lindus came to the office and said he had been further considering the matter, and he did not see why his two youngest children should be left out, but that the eldest son should be left out entirely, as he had nothing further to do with him. I told him I could not alter the deed in any way, but he was so terribly violent that I pre<lb/>pared a subsequent document, giving the property to the two children by his first marriage. That was the modification that I concurred in. As the deed stood, it left out the two youngest children of the first marriage; he was determined to have it altered; he said he would ruin himself, and make himself bankrupt, that the deed should be upset; and he so frightened Mrs. Lindus that I had no other course open to me but to prepare the deed and leave it for future consideration. As the deed stood, the settle-ment was upon Mrs. Lindus and her two children, and all the three children by his first wife were excluded. As it was altered, the two younger children by his first marriage got a benefit, excluding the elder; that accounts for there being two trustees put in. It was after I came from the hospital that I issued the writ for libel. I think the action for</p>

I am a brother of the last witness, and am common law managing clerk to the firm of which he is a partner—I have known the prisoner since October, 1891, by his calling at the office—on 10th January I saw him there about ten o'clock—he asked if Mr. Jacobs was in—I said, "No"—he asked what time I expected him—I said, "Between eleven and twelve"—he said, "I have an appointment with him"—I said, "Where?"—he said, "Forest Gate"—I said, possibly he might not come to the office first—he appeared anxious that he should be at Forest Gate by twelve—I sent for a time-table, and he went out—a few minutes before twelve he came in with Mrs. and Miss Lindus—one of the lads took his name in to Mr. Jacobs—he stayed about a minute, and said, "I will be back in a moment," and went out—he returned in about two minutes—Zabell asked him to step into Mr. Jacobs' room—I preceded him, and announced him, and then went into my own room—while there I heard screams, and I ran back to Mr. Jacobs' room—as I got towards the door I saw a flash through the glass and heard a report—I tried to get in at the door, but could not open it; I then sprang to the sliding panel, and as I got there, there was another flash and report—I pushed the panel open, and saw Mr. Jacobs standing to the left beside the paper-stand, and the prisoner in front, pointing at him with a revolver in his hand—I went back to the door, and put my arm through the glass—just as I did so the door flew open, and I rushed in and seized the prisoner by the right wrist—he let the revolver drop-out of his hand—I put my arm round him, and caught his left wrist and held him—Zabell came in—the prisoner struggled violently, and Zabell called out that he was biting him—we called for help, and Mr. Millar came in, pulled the prisoner down, and held him till the police came—I have known the prisoner since 1891, coming to the office—I never saw any signs of insanity about him—on the morning of the 10th he appeared quite sober—he talked in a rational way.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons, and a member of the Royal College of Physicians, practising at Southminster—I knew the prisoner during the time he lived there—on 18th October he came to consult me with regard to his daughter's condition—I saw him again on 24th October, and 8th November, and two or three days a week after that date down to about the first week in January, 1894—I did not so much notice on 18th October that his manner was peculiar—it was a slight interview, in which he asked me to see his daughter—on the 24th his peculiar noteless and vacant condition struck me—noteless is an Essex term—he had a pecular hesitation in answering questions—it struck me as peculiar—I think it was on 26th October that I operated on his daughter's tonsils—I saw him then, and for days and days afterwards—I did not notice him much on the 26th—I saw him between 26th October and 8th November—I cannot say whether the peculiarities existed between those dates—on 8th November, from ten to 10.30 p.m., I heard my door-bell violently rung—I answered the door, and saw the prisoner standing outside—he had a wine-bottle in his hand, and he was waving it about from side to side—he said, "I have been poisoned; I have got diphtheria, and all my family"—at the same time he grasped his throat violently, as if in pain there—he used some foul expressions with regard to what he had been doing; eating and drinking his own excretion—he threatened to shoot Tom Stammers and Allen Stewart the first time he met them—he was in a state of great excitement, perspiration was rolling off his head and down his face, and his eyes were almost starting out of his head—he did not give me the idea of being drunk—I asked him to come in, and took him into my consulting room, and talked to him for half an hour or more, with the result that he quieted down—I explained to him that there was no necessity for him to look on the case so badly, and I promised to see his children next day, and examine them—he was quiet when he left me—he left the bottle behind him—I promised to examine it and see if there was anything wrong with it, and see him about it next day—there was no poison in it—it was a bottle of water, I believe, that he had taken it from his cistern—I believed he supposed that had poisoned him—I cannot say I examined it—I called next morning, 9th November, at ten o'clock, and examined his children's throats and his own, and could find no evidence of diptheria, so I did not call any more—I saw him very irregularly throughout that month and December—his little boy was very seriously ill with inflammation of the eyes, and he used to come and see me very often, and once or twice the prisoner came with him—the peculiarity of his manner continued to some extent—I had some difficulty in getting answers to questions from him—he seemed to hesitate and to doubt whether he could express what he wanted to in the necessary words—he did finally get it out—I saw him about the end of the first week in January, before he left Southminster, and then I next saw him in Holloway Gaol, last Monday, 2nd April—I examined him there—Dr. Walker, the prison surgeon, was present at the time—I found the prisoner an altered man—externally he had</p>

               <p>shrivelled considerably—there was great loss of flesh—he had the same vacant noteless condition that I had noticed when I first saw him, only that it had considerably increased—his articulation was very indistinct—the pupils of his eyes wore dilated, both equally—his gait was shuffling—he complained very much of sleeplessness and depression of spirits—his physical condition was consistent with the reality of those complaints—his loss of memory was the most important symptom in his case—his memory was gone—he did not recognise me; he took me for a clerk from the Home Office, and wanted to know what my business was—in conjunction with Dr. Walker I made a careful ex<lb/>amination of him at that time—the symptoms I have described in my opinion pointed to his being insane—such symptoms are symptoms of alcoholic insanity—the symptoms I saw indicated disease of the brain, which was the cause of the alcoholic insanity—I could not form an opinion as to the length of the duration of those symptoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We were perfect strangers until he came to South<lb/>minster—beyond meeting him every day, and passing him in the street, I had not noticed him until his daughter suffered from her tonsils—I had no conversation with him about his past history—my first real conversation with him was when I went to see his daughter Margaret, aged about fourteen—she did not explain her symptoms to me, and he said nothing about her throat—I looked at her tonsils—she made no complaint of in<lb/>flammation of the throat—the prisoner recommended the operation, and asked for it to be performed, and I did it; I thought it was the right thing to do, or I should not have done it—he came for me, and said he had had his own tonsils cut—it is not a very uncommon thing to do—when I saw her I recommended him to have the operation done—he suggested that which I thought the proper thing to do—I did not attend much to him on the day of the operation—nothing struck me, as a medical man, for the necessity, for the safety of persons around him, to speak of his state of mind, till the incident of his coming with the bottle—except the day of the operation, my visits to his house lasted about ten minutes—I was not called in to see him at all—the boy's eyes got bad on 15th December—he was about ten or eleven years old—I do not know his name, nor the name of the other children—the boy came to my surgery about his eyes on every occasion—the bottle incident was before that—I did not warn Tom Stammers or Allen Stewart that the prisoner said he would shoot them—I cannot say that the symptoms then differed at all from those of delirium tremens, because you get very similar symptoms in delirium tremens, but the nervous excitement which I noticed, and the way in which the symptoms passed off before he left me, led me to think it was not delirium tremens—I don't think a man suffering from delirium tremens would be quietened down in half an hour—I formed the opinion from that that this was distinguished from delirium tremens—that is my opinion—I decline to admit that it is a scientific opinion—I went to Holloway Prison on 2nd April, because of instructions from the prisoner's solicitor, Mr. Ford—I don't know if he is Mr. Bicknell's clerk—he called on me on 19th February—I had then seen about the shooting in the paper—I had never seen Mr. Ford before—he wrote and asked for an interview, and then came and saw me—at that time I had not seen the prisoner since the crime—I would not have given a certificate to</p>

               <p>incarcerate him in a lunatic asylum up to the last time I saw him at the end of the first week in January—I don't remember Mr. Ford telling me he was defending the prisoner—I daresay he referred to him as having lived at Southminster; I don't remember the exact conversation—the son did not come with Mr. Ford—I don't remember any conversation with Ford as to the family living at Southminster—I did not know Dr. Walker before—I did not ask him to assist in making observations; he was present—the interview lasted a little over an hour—when the prisoner left the room I and the doctor left together—I think our first words were, "What is your opinion of the case?" and I was under the impression at the time that Dr. Walker was on the other side, and I declined to answer—I don't know if we parted without finding out we were on the same side—I have only seen Dr. Walker once, on 2nd April, before to-day—I do not know of the prisoner being weighed before and after the crime—a man in prison with a charge hanging over him, and not having resort to drink, would naturally become depressed if he was in the habit of indulging in drink occasionally too freely—I should think that would make him lose in weight—his loss of weight was visible.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of Holloway Prison, where the prisoner has been confined from 10th January till to-day—I have had him under my constant observation ever since his admission—he is dull and apathetic, he takes no interest in any of his surroundings; he has been very melancholic; he has suffered a good deal from gastric disturbance; his tongue has been tremulous; he has a hesitation in his speech, and his mind appears to be confused—I think his condition now is somewhat worse than it was when he first came under my notice, but the symptoms have been in existence since the date of his admission—I think those symptoms, combined with the history of his past, are consistent with, and indicative of, alcoholic insanity—there is another matter, the letters he has written to his son, which I have seen—the symptoms I spoke of certainly accompany a well-known form of insanity, melancholia, and are consistent with it—melancholia is frequently accompanied by homicidal and suicidal tendencies—delusions are a frequent accompaniment of melancholia—about the most common delusion in that form of insanity is that there is a conspiracy against the person who suffers from the delusion—I think it is a common accompany<lb/>ing delusion that a person is being poisoned by what he is given to eat and drink—my attention has not been directed to this case more than to all the other mental cases that come under my notice—I have seen the prisoner every other day—I did not know that a question would be raised in regard to the condition of his mind—I first knew it, I think, on the occasion of Dr. Coombe's visit on 2nd April—I had observed him every other day between 10th January and 2nd April—I was in the room when Dr. Coombe examined him—I expressed the opinion I had formed to Dr. Coombe—very often in such cases I believe an expert is called in by</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been at Holloway since January, 1894—that is the first prison I have been at where I have had under my care persons waiting trial—there is an assistant medical officer there, who has been there for a good many years—he had equal opportunity to see the prisoner—Mr. Coombe did not consult with him—it was not his duty to be there—I am not aware of any order to the effect that an officer of Her Majesty's prisons may not converse with the medical men sent on behalf of persons waiting trial—this is the subpoena I received—it is dated 2nd April, but it was served on me yesterday morning at the Court—I was attending here in another case—the clerk who gave me the subpoena gave me a guinea conduct money—I make a note of all cases in the prison, and there is a note of this case—I have the official notes made in every case—I do not keep a pocket-book for notes; I have a few notes of this case I made for my own information—I have some notes on a piece of paper; I jotted those down yesterday from memory, after receiving the subpoena—these are the original notes I jotted down; they are not copied from any<lb/>thing—the prisoner is suffering from melancholia in the form of alcoholic insanity—alcoholic insanity takes the form of melancholia—I concur in saying that all the symptoms Dr. Coombe observed were consistent with the effects of drink—when I made those notes all the things did not occur to me at one time, and I put in some afterwards—he was very morose—gastric disturbance refers to his foul tongue, and his inability to take ordinary food—he had to live on milk diet principally—that is common to all drunkards to a certain extent—I have never been examined at a murder trial as to whether a man knew that what he did was a crime at the time of doing it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am vestry foreman at the vestry depot, Notting Dale—I live there—on 28th February, at about 5.20, I was standing out<lb/>side the door of the depot tool-house, on the footway, in the Walmer Road—I saw a costermonger's barrow and pony coming along towards me just a little faster than the ordinary traffic, in the direction of Prince's Road, on the off-side of the road, the wrong side the opposite side to that on which I was—the prisoner was driving and two other men were in the barrow, which was about fifteen yards from me when I first saw it, and that would be about thirty yards from where the man was knocked down—it passed me, and then I heard shouting, and noticed a man walking across the road in front of the vehicle—the near shaft caught him about the shoulders, knocking him down and the near wheel parsed over his body—the barrow pulled up a, quickly as it possibly could—I ran to the spot, told the prisoner and the men in the barrow to remain, and sent for the police—the man on the ground was Isaac Mills, one of the Kensington Vestry's employes—he had just left off work, put his tools down at the tool-house, gone to Mary Place, and walked across the road—I saw him leave the tool-house a few minutes before, and proceed towards Mary Place—I did not go to him when he was on the ground; others picked him up—he was 73 years old—he was a hale man for his time of life; we always took his age as 66—the prisoner and his friends in the trap appeared to me as though they had been drinking—one of the friends took the pony away, and I did not see any more of the other—the deceased walked behind me to the station with a constable's assistance.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner pulled up as soon as he possibly could, in between six and ten yards—stimulants were sent for for the deceased, I don't know who sent or paid for them—opposite Mary Place there was a barrow with a broom, shovel, and pick in it; it was opposite to where this took place, and on the prisoner's near side—I did not notice if the prisoner was driving a Russian pony—I cannot say if such pones are short-tempered; at times they are very hard-mouthed—a man would be driving properly if he pulled out to the off-side to clear something on his near-side—I did not see the pony shy across the road as he passed the barrow; I should not like to swear it did not—when I first saw the prisoner he was about thirty yards from the barrow and and at that time he was on the off-side—he was not near the crown of the road, but more towards the right-hand side footway—there was no traffic between him</p>

I am divisional surgeon to the police at Notting Dale Police-station—on 28th February I was called there, and I saw the deceased—he was suffering from dislocation of the right shoulder, abrasions on the right side of his face, and general shock—I ordered his removal to the hospital—he was taken to the West London—I do not know of my own knowledge that he was not taken in there—the injuries he had received were serious; that was why I sent him to the hospital—I formed no opinion as to the ultimate effect of them—I knew what was the cause of the occurrence.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I cannot say if it would have been beneficial to him to have been immediately attended to at the hospital—I was before the Coroner's jury—no person was called there from the hospital—I send all cases to the hospital that cannot be attended to at the station—I had no means at that time of making a sufficient examination to see whether there were any internal injuries—there might have been.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, of Norland Place, Notting Hill—on 1st March, about eight p.m., I was called to see Mills at his residence, 7, Treadgold Street, which is about five minutes' walk from the scene of the accident—I found him in bed, suffering from abdominal pains and constant vomiting—that was all he complained of—his head and shoulder were bandaged—I formed the opinion that he was suffering then from some abdominal trouble; I heard he had been run over in the street—I thought he was suffering from some internal injury, leading to peritonitis, which is inflammation of the peritoniem—that would cause great pain, and nearly always produce vomiting—I prescribed for him, and left him—he died early next morning, about four, I think—I did not see him again alive—I made a post-mortem on 6th March, and found evidence of peritonitis—I could not say what was the immediate cause of it, except, generally, injury sustained—there was no bone or anything that could have ruptured the peritoneum—I found a perforation in the bowel; I cannot say how that was caused, or at what time, but it was associated, no doubt, with the peritonitis—peritonitis was the cause of death, in my opinion—I was told he was a little over 70; he appeared to be in good health, apart from the peritonitis; he was rather a tine man for his years; I should have taken him to be about 60.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Police Sergeant</hi>). On Saturday, March 17th, about 1.10, I was in Houndsditch, walking north-east towards Aldgate, and saw four boys playing in the asphalted road—each had on one roller skate—just behind the boys I saw a pony and barrow coming towards me on its right side, two or three feet from the kerb—Rosenberg, the de<lb/>ceased, moved out into the road facing Gravel Lane, which was nearly opposite on my left—the other boys ran away, but Rosenberg was side<lb/>face to the pony, and did not appear to see it coming, and the pony's breast struck him and knocked him down—he fell over to the near side on the left side of his head, and the near wheel of the barrow passed over his head just above his ear—some people shouted, and the barrow was pulled up about a dozen doors further on—the boy was picked up and taken to the London Hospital—the prisoner was driving; I did not hear him or anyone call out—he was going eight or nine miles an hour—that is a faster pace than ponies usually go—he stopped just as I got up to him—I said, "Get down; I believe you have killed that boy"—he did not get down; he did not seem to realise what had happened—I called out to him two or three times to get down, and he did so—I was in uni<lb/>form, and on duty—when he got down I saw that he was drunk; he could not walk straight, and he seemed dazed—he was certainly not in a fit state to drive—he said nothing—when I shouted to him to get down another man got up from the bottom of the barrow very drunk; he was helped out of the barrow, and he and the prisoner were taken to the station—Constable Webber returned from the hospital, and in con<lb/>sequence of what he said, I charged the prisoner with causing the death of the boy, and also with being drunk when in charge of a horse and trap—he said, "I was not drunk"—that was half-an-hour afterwards—the inspector said, "You are drunk now"—his voice was thick—he said, "The boy ran from behind a van"—there was no van between the prisoner and me—the road in front of him was clear of vehicles, but there were foot passengers walking in the road.</p>

I am a tailor, of Aston Street, Bow—on Saturday, March 17th, I was in Houndsditch, going from Aldgate to Bishopsgate, on the right-hand side going down; that is the same side as Gravel Lane—I crossed the road about six doors before I got to Gravel Lane, and was two and a half feet from the opposite kerb, when I saw the prisoner driving the barrow on the Aldgate side—I ran on the pavement to get out of his way—he was driving about eight miles an hour, and he had no sooner passed me than I saw a boy standing four or five feet off in the road,</p>

On March 12th I was with Sergeant Summers and Constable Eason at the Great Northern Goods Railway Yard, Finsbury Park, at eleven a.m.—I saw the prisoner just by the side of the yard—I walked towards him, and asked what his name was—he said "Brown"—I said, "I believe you are John Dalby, wanted on a warrant at Leicester. You will have to come back this way with me"—I caught hold of his left arm—I said, "I am a police officer"—I held his left arm with my right hand, and we walked back towards the gates about a dozen yards—Summers and Eason came towards us—I said to Summers, "This is the man we want on the warrant"—we all four turned and walked towards the Police-station, I still holding his left arm; Summers walked on his right side, and Eason behind—I saw the prisoner put his left hand into his jacket left-hand outside pocket—he was wearing an overcoat, and this jacket under it; both coats were undone—I said, "What are you doing?" and immediately a report followed, and smoke came from the pocket—I put my hand in his pocket, and found he had hold of this six-chambered revolver, which I took from his hand—he was holding it with the muzzle pointing upwards in his pocket—five chambers were loaded, and one had been discharged—his pocket was burning, we put it out—I don't know what became of the bullet—I did not see it—it must have gone up through the coat, and out through the outside breast pocket, passing through this handkerchief, which was in that pocket, and which was burnt—I said to the prisoner, "You might have shot me"—he replied, "Good job if I had; I would have shot the b—lot if I knew you were coming as you did. It is all my own fault for coming near this place"—he was taken to the station, and charged with attempting to murder me by shooting at me—after the charge was read to him he said, "Did I point the revolver at anyone?"—I found six other cartridges in his left vest pocket—Summers had the warrant against him; it is for felony—these documents were found on him when he was searched at the station. (<hi rend="italic">These were four letters addressed to his wife from different places, and contained expressions of regret at having to leave her and his children; admitting that he had done wrong in consequence of losing money at horse races, and containing these passages</hi>: "I can<lb/>not let them take me alive, and have bought a revolver for someone besides myself."

I am a surgeon at Catford—on 15th February I saw the dead body of a child at Lewisham Police-station—I could not at that time form an opinion as to how long it had been dead, or how long it had been in the water—on the 18th I made a post-mortem ex<lb/>amination—the cause of death was suffocation from drowning—the organs were all healthy—there were no external marks of violence—there was milk food in the stomach, showing it had been recently fed—I should say it had been dead not more than two days from the time of my first seeing the body, on the 15th.</p>

When I came out I met a lady, and she asked me whether the baby was a boy or a girl. I told her it was a boy, and she said she wanted a boy to adopt as her own. The baby was wearing a heliotrope hat, and the lady took that off and put a white hat on. She put a pink shawl on, and told me to keep the one I got from the workhouse"—I said to the prisoner, "Do you wish to say anything?"—she replied, "No, that is all I can say about the child"—I then told her I should take her to Lewisham Police-station to see my inspector—I found this shawl (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) at the prisoner's lodging—it has been identified by Nurse Thompson—I took her to the station; that was on instructions from Inspector Fox—I wired to him, and he came—I communicated to him the statement the prisoner had made, and showed him the note I had made of it, and he spoke to her.</p>

I am the wife of Thomas Tutton, of 6, Sultan Terrace, Camberwell—on Saturday night, 17th March, I was in Sultan Street, about 9.30, and noticed a disturbance—I went up and saw Weatherley standing up, with his helmet off, and the crowd round him—his face was bleeding—he was trying to take hold of Linehan—Linehan and Sheehan knocked him down—he jumped up, and he staggered; he was very silly—I said, "Come away, they will kill you"—when he was knocked down he fell on the top of me, and hurt my leg—I tried to take his part—when he got up again he again tried to take Linehan—I saw Sheehan there when I first went up—I did not see Chappell till Weatherley was on the ground—Linehan and Sheehan, who were both together, knocked Weatherley down a second time—he got up, and the same two prisoners knocked him down a third time—he had hold of Linehan; Weatherley was on the top of him, and they rolled over towards the gutter—while they were on the ground I saw Chappell kick Weatherley in the head, and he said, "Get up, you b—"—I saw him receive several other kicks when on the ground, but I cannot say who gave those—Linehan lay on the ground under the policeman, and did not appear to be doing anything—I said to all present, including Chappell and Sheehan, "Mind you, if you kill him, mind you, I am a witness"—I was in danger of my life—in trying to protect Weatherley's head I received a kick from someone—I don't think it was either of the prisoners—I was insulted for taking Weatherley's part—I saw my husband in the crowd, and I ran to him and told him to go and get a constable; I said, "They are killing the policeman; go quick"—a constable came, Linehan was taken into custody, and I saw Weatherley assisted to the station.</p>

I am a surgeon, of 304, Walworth Road—late on Satur<lb/>day night, 17th March, I saw Weatherley at the Police-station—he was covered all over his face and clothing with blood—I examined his wounds—on the right side of his head was a recent incised wound about one inch long, still bleeding—about two inches behind that was an abrased wound, about one inch in circumference, as if from a kick—there were four or five other swellings on various parts of his head, which might have been caused by the buckle of such a belt as this, or kicks—his left ear was very much battered; that injury could have been caused by this belt—the right ear was similarly injured, but not so severely; the cause might have been the same—both his lips were cut, swollen, and bleeding; his eyes were swollen and blood<lb/>shot, as if from a blow—I found two digs on his nose, which might have been caused by the point of a poker, or by the point of a buckle—the nasal bone was fractured—over the shin of the right leg was an incised wound about one inch long; that was probably caused by such a weapon as this poker, used obliquely in a sort of stabbing way—he had a similar wound on the inside of his right knee, which could have been caused in a similar way—those two wounds were both superficial—he was weak and exhausted—I saw him once afterwards, and after that the divisional surgeon attended him, but I saw him at the Police-court—he is recovering from his injuries; I think it will be some time before he will be able to return to active duty—he is still unfit for duty—I was called in because it was an urgent matter, and I live a few doors from the Police-station—I saw him yesterday and the day before—he is quite unfit for duty—is it</p>

I live at 60, Hollington Street, Camberwell; my husband, Edward Copley, is a plasterer—on 17th March I was going through Sultan Passage, and I saw Chappell (whom I have known by sight and to speak to for a good many years) with a woman, standing outside the Sultan, dancing and singing together—there was no crowd round—a constable asked the woman to go away, and she turned and used obscene language to the constable, and got hold of his tunic—he said, "You had better go away; if not, I will take you"—Chappell, who had moved away while the constable was talking to the woman, came up, and the constable asked him to go away, too—the woman moved away; Chappell did not go—during the altercation between him and the constable, Linehan came from the opposite side of the way, and said to Chappell, "Why don't you go away, old man? Don't get into any bother"—he took him by the arm and said, "Come away, Jack; you don't want to get into any bother"—the constable said, "What has it to do with you?"—Linehan said, "I was only asking him to go away quietly"—the constable got hold of Linehan and moved him on into the road, talking to and pushing him at the same time—the constable then got Linehan by the collar, and struck him twice hard on the jaw with his fist—the blows were likely to leave a mark—in the struggle, before they fell, Linehan struck the constable once—then they fell to the ground, and I do not know anything more that took place—two women took Chappell away; I don't know where to—I went up the street when the constable and Linehan fell, and I saw Chappell's mother—when I came back to her Chappell was outside the Sultan—I did not hear the whistle blown, nor see the other policeman come up, nor Weatherley kicked when on the ground, nor struck with the buckle—I saw Sheehan once out there—I took no notice of him, as he usually did stand out there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I saw Linehan cross the road towards the constable—he came behind him, but he was not near enough to strike him—he was behind him while he was talking to Chappell—I am certain the constable struck Linehan first—the constable was quite unprovoked—I don't know that the woman lives with Linehan; I think not—she is married, I believe—I have not seen her since—a few people collected afterwards—I went away, leaving Linehan and the constable struggling.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband was a cowman and dairyman; now he is an inmate of St. Thomas's Hospital—I am acting as wardmaid at that hospital—I live at 51, Sultan Street, and on this night I was coming home from work, and I saw Chappell outside with a woman and a little boy—Chappell and the woman were larking, and a constable came up and told them to move then—Chappell said, "All right, governor, "speaking</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189404020084"/>
               <p>very kindly—he appeared to be quite sober—the constable said, "No, you go on; I don't want any nonsense," and took hold of him and shoved him—Linehan, I think it was, was standing in the road, with his hands in his pockets, and he said, "Now, Chappell, go on, my man; you don't want to get into any trouble"—two women pulled Chappell away—the constable said, "What do you know about it?" and shoved Linehan, who said, "All right, governor"—before he had time to go away, the constable took him by the collar, and struck him twice on the right cheek with his fist; it appeared to be hard—I said, "What a shame to knock that poor man about! How ill he looks!"—Linehan turned and pushed the constable, and they fell; he did not strike the constable—a crowd came up, and I saw some men rush up to the constable, but I did not know who they were, for I was so frightened I went indoors—it all happened in two or three minutes—I did not see what happened when they fell to the ground—I heard cries when I got indoors that they were knocking him about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was not at the Police-court—on Saturday night Mrs. Lineham stopped me coming from work, and said her husband heard me say what a cruel thing it was to knock him about, and two men came to me the night before last with a piece of paper—Sultan Street is a very rough and cruel neighbourhood, and there are very <hi rend="italic">funny</hi> and rough people there, but I really think the policeman lost his temper before he ought to—I did not see Lineham strike the policeman in the face; he may have done so—I did not see the policeman's face bleeding—as soon as they fell I came away—I did not see much of it—the crowd collected at once, and I thought I had better be off—when I came down an hour afterwards I saw one of them standing outside the Sultan—on Sunday Inspector Race came to me—I did not tell him I saw the whole thing—I saw no one strike with a belt—I think I told Race that I saw someone run up to the constable when he fell—I saw a lot of men run up to the constable; I don't know who they were—a man ran up to the constable and struck him with a belt, I believe, over the shoulder, but I don't know whether he struck the constable; he was going to strike someone, no doubt—he was a big man; I don't know if he was Sheehan or not; he was very much like him—I think this is the belt; it was like this—I know Mrs. Linehan now; I did not know her before she came and spoke to me—she was not the woman who was dancing with Chappell on this night; she was not there—the woman with Chappell was named Shoe—she was very drunk, making a great disturbance, holding up her petticoats and dancing—the constable requested them to move on, and they would not do so—the same man that used the belt kicked the con<lb/>stable on his temple, I think, when he was on the ground; I had forgotten at first—I only saw one kick—I did not see the short poker; I heard afterwards that it was used—one of the witnesses, a woman, I think, said she heard there was a poker—I don't remember seeing Chappell there—I knew Sheehan by sight before this night; his mother lives opposite my house; I see him constantly when I am at home—I think he is the man that used the belt and kicked the policeman; I have no doubt about it—Linehan came up behind the constable when he first came up—he did not strike the constable from behind directly he came up.</p>

                  </hi>. My husband is a plasterer—on this evening I had just come out, and was outside a shop near the Sultan—I saw Linehan coming across the road, and the policeman pushed him and struck him twice, and then Linehan pushed the policeman, and they fell against the shop—it all happened in two or three minutes—I went on my errand, and saw nothing else—a crowd soon accumulated—Linehan called out for mercy; he said, "For God's sake, take him off me!"—the constable had him by the throat, and had one of his knees on his stomach, holding him violently—the policeman threw him down with great force on the back of his head on the road, which is paved with stone—that is all I saw.</p>

I am an oilman, of 239, Wandsworth Road—about 11.30 p.m. on 19th March, I left my premises perfectly safe, and went to bed—I have revolving shutters screwed up with a padlock inside—I was awoke about 2.30 by the police, and then found my front shutter in the doorway had been forced up—I missed 7s. 10d. in money and my assistant's overcoat, and some of his money—I know the coat.</p>
