The other boy said, he had no more than a shilling, and then they both ran away; I looked at the window directly and I found the handkerchiefs gone; I immediately pursued them; I saw which way they went, they turned to the left and went up Market-lane; I ran after them into the market, and I saw Crawley throw the handkerchiefs from under his coat under a dark window, when I was not three yards from him.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see what he threw down? - No, I went and picked up what he threw down and laid hold of him; they were my handkerchiefs, and the person was the prisoner Crawley: I am quite sure that the boy I laid hold of in the street was the same boy who was in the shop by the window.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understand you right you did not see him take the handkerchiefs, but you knew they were there when he came in, and you missed them immediately as he went out? - It was so.</p>

I was alarmed a little, it was a star light night, I rather apprehended that it was the person the prisoner called out to and said, he was hobbled to; I thought it was best to keep him in custody, and the man came nearer to me and he addressed me exactly in these words, says he, what is the matter? sir, says I, there is a boy here that I have found with a little matter about him; says he, there is another over the ditch, do you know what is lost, and he clapped the gun on the ditch, and he said, if you stir a foot I will shoot you; it is the big one,

Did you overtake Rowe or meet him? - When I was going down the road<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090010"/>he was going across the field, out of all road, he was on one side, I catched hold of him, if I had not been there he would have run immediately into the road going from Pentonville into Cold Bath fields.</p>

            Did you pursue the same road after you took him, that he was going? - I did, I was not in the least apprehensive of meeting with any other; I intended to have gone as far as the public house and to have got the people belonging to the public house to detain him, while I went back to Pentonville, only I was deprived of that opportunity by the circumstance that interfered.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nobody near him when you took him? - No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Court to Mr Burden. How was your sashes fastened? - By a spring fastening, the sash was forced up, and by that means the spring is not so good as it was.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Martin. I works with my father preparing rushes for the tallow chandlers, and I had been finishing some work that day, and on the night I was going up to Mr. Springall's a tallow chandler at Islington, two men coming along they said, get out of the way, they chucked this bundle over the bank and they ran away, and I got over to look at it, and two men came up, one with the gun, and they asked me what I did there? I said, nothing; they said, there is a man just now that has been knocked down and robbed, and they laid hold of me, and that gentleman came along, and the two men said, I must go, and they let me loose in the mob, and I stood in among them; I am really as innocent of it as the child unborn; the two men that took me into custody is not here, they let me go, they said, they would have nothing to do with it; I do not know who they are, I never saw them before in my life; I was loose among the mob above ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Rowe. I was coming from Islington leading a drove of sheep, coming across the fields I saw a man with a four legged table on his head, I immediately followed him and gets over into the field, and he makes pretence to buckle his shoe and left the watch case on the ground, when I came up close to him says he, here is something for you; says I, I don't want it, and I turned about and picked it up and was going along and that man came over to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Caseby. Did you know either of these men before? - I knew Rowe but I did not know Martin.</p>

               <p>I was present on the 3d of November; I was the outside of the mail coach, I was going down to Dover; at the Gloucester coffee house the mail coach stopped to take up a gentleman which filled the inside, as soon as the gentleman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090012"/>got into the coach the coachman crossed to the left hand side of Piccadilly, and just as we got to the dead wall, an hackney coach came near to us; on the near side, and drove forcibly by us; after he had passed us, when we got to Dover-street, he slackened his pace till we came even with him, a breast, as soon as we got even with him he began whipping his horses and set them on a gallop and got before us, I was rather alarmed for I was afraid our leaders would be frightened by his conduct; when we got opposite Park-street or Park-lane, he waited till we got up to him again, as soon as we got opposite to him again, he began whipping his horses and passed through Hyde-park turnpike, we were a little behind him, some persons crossing the turnpike prevented our horses going furiously, which gave the hackney coachman a good opportunity of getting some distance before us; when we got opposite St George's hospital, I saw the coach going on very gently, the mail coachman said to me, I wish to God the fellow would get on before me, the hackney coachman suffered us to come opposite to him again, as soon as we got a breast to him, he began galloping his horses just as he had done before; when we got to Knightsbridge a man put his head out of the coach and said, Damn him whip him; our driver began whipping the hackney coachman, and the hackney coachman gave him two strokes with the whip; I held my head down as low as I could in order to avoid having a cut across the eyes; the mail coachman learned over me to whip the driver of the hackney coach; in a very little time I heard the discharge of a pistol; I immediately holds my head up, and I said to the coachman, I hope to God the guard has not shot him, I am not satisfied about it I wish you would enquire; the coachman turns about to the guard, he says, Pat you have not shot at him; he said, no, I shot at or about his legs, I cannot be positive which; on that we went on to Brentford; but I recollect the guard should say to me, sir, did not you see him cut me across the face, says he, sir, he has cut me across the face here, and it is all over dirt; at Brentford at a public house on the right hand side of the way, the coachman stopped and the guard got down and said, give me a cloth to wipe my face, a wet cloth, and he did wipe his face, I did not see his face. We then proceeded on to our journey and I got to Andover, and coming up I enquired of his character, and I heard an extreme good character of the guard.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. You was leaning down in case you should receive a blow, and it was in that situation that you heard the pistol fired? - I am sure I had not raised myself up when I heard it fired.</p>
               <p>Q. So that the mail coach might have brought the guard within the hackney coachman's whip at the time you heard the pistol? - It might.</p>
               <p>Court. What part of the coach did the prisoner set in? - He was the guard of the mail, he sat behind.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Did you hear there was an additional bag that day? - When I was at the Inn in the city, I heard him swearing to some of the men that they were wrong in filling up his place behind, and I see a white bag in his hand.</p>

             said, he would rather ride outside, and I went inside, we went on from thence till we got just this side of Downing-street; I said, Daniel don't go so fast; I saw a coach coming, I suppose it was the mail coach, just at Hyde-park corner, he went faster again, I said, Daniel why do you go so fast, and just as I came to Knightsbridge I put my head out of the window, and I says to the mail coachman take and whip him, the mail coach went by then.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you say so then? - I cannot give any reason for saying so only by his going fast. When the coachman came opposite of him, he began whipping of him, and

               <p>Q. How near was the mail coach to you when you first saw it? - He was near to me but I kept before him, he got close to me at last, I kept before him all the way till he came in nearly this side of Knightsbridge, then I broke way for him, but I reckoned that they ought to have the best horses going and not such poor horses as hackney coaches have got.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing passed between you and the other coachman? - Yes, the coachman whipped at me and I whipped at him again, he only whipped me as he passed by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you continue whipping as he passed by? - I whipped at the coachman, but not so often as he did at me.</p>
               <p>Q. How often did he whip at you? - I cannot tell, but the coach was going on all the time; when the guard came along side of the box that I was on, he said, now damn your blood I'll blow your brains out; he might be about ten yards from me before he fired.</p>

               <p>I had lived with Mr. Finney four years and a half; between the hour of seven and eight on Friday, the 4th of January, in the evening the prisoner came backward, and went down into the cellar, and took the iron rods out of the cellar, and he went out of doors, when we went out of doors leaving off work, he whipped up the court, and took him on his shoulder, this was about eight o'clock, he had left them in that court, it is a private court. I asked him what he was going to do with them, he said, he was going to sell them to make up some rent, he said, he could sell them at three or four places, and asked me to go with him, we went to a house in Petticoat-lane, the man's name was Jones; Ireland offered him the rods to sell, and Jones offered him a penny a pound, the price of old iron, Ireland said, that would not do, he said, he would go up further, and see if he could get more, in the mean time Mr. Armstrong came in, and he asked whose rods they were? Ireland made answer and said, they are mine, he said more than that, he thought it very hard he could not go, and sell his own property, as he wanted money so bad; then Mr. Armstrong laid hold of him, and ordered somebody to take the curtain rods; these are the same that are now secured, they were Mr. Finney's.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you to have any share of this money? - No, there was no mention of a share.</p>

(The examination was not taken in writing.) This was when he was waiting in the office to be examined; they were examined, and the next morning Mr. Finney came to the office, and claimed them, this was Friday night they were taken. Holland was admitted an evidence on the Monday following; he was committed on Friday till Monday, and then bail was given for him on Monday night, he has been at large ever since.

(Produced and deposed to.) I am sure that is the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming along, I heard a cry of stop thief; I saw a man run by me; the prosecutor was much intoxicated with liquor, he says I believe this is the man; I turned about to see what was the matter, seeing them running and calling stop thief.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness to his character.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. Bryant was in liquor very much, so that no one could take his word for any thing.</p>
               <p>Constable. Mr. Bryant was rather in liquor, but not so much as the prisoner represents; he certainly knew what he did.</p>

I found immediately my pocket was picked; and, from the sudden motion, I naturally put my hand in my pocket; and I found a black silk cloak was taken out of my great coat pocket Two men were turning about, on which I followed them immediately; and, in about ten paces, I laid hold of them. I said to the people about, give me assistance, these two villains have robbed me. I laid hold of the two; and they being too strong, forced themselves from my hands; on account of that I cries out stop thief; the witness present lays hold of one, and I laid hold of the prisoner; he ran round a coach; and I took him. I took him then into a shop, and the person said, I saw that fellow with his hand in a gentleman's pocket not half an hour ago; and I think you are bound in justice, for the good of the public, to prosecute him; in consequence of that, we sent to the patrole, and conducted him to the rotation office, from thence he was committed. The prisoner is one of them that I see who got round behind the coach; before ever they got round this coach, I had got them; and they broke from me and ran round the coach. I am sure the prisoner is one of the men that I first saw; for he was-never out of my sight till he broke away from me; and I am quite sure that he is one of the two men that I saw near me when I felt that motion at my pocket; there was no any other man ten paces before or behind, but these two men.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had that cloak in your pocket? - About half an hour, I had been to conduct a young lady home,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090024"/>and I put it in my pocket coming home, I came from Argyle-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you felt that motion had you any occasion to take notice, whether you had your cloak in your pocket? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. So that it is possible it might have been lost? - It is possible, but I do not believe it.</p>

            , I lost the money in his house, the first day of November, it was not taken in the day, but in the night, I lost six guineas, and a half crown; there was ten half guineas, and one guinea, it was all in one apartment, just over the kitchen, it was a ground floor, I lodged in the ground floor, I had my money in my pocket; I went to bed about nine o'clock, I am sure it was in my pocket when I went to bed; the prisoner lodged in one bed with me, I felt him rising at his own side of the bed about twelve or one o'clock, he came round the bed to my side, he took the breeches from under my head, I heard him opening a knife with a strong spring, and I was afraid of my life, he did not touch me indeed, I lay still till just the break of day, when I discovered it to the man of the house; the prisoner stayed till break of day; he came into bed to me just after robbing me; I got up first in the morning, and I discovered it to the man of the house, and he told me he would go and get a constable; it was Sunday morning, I could not get any money to get a constable, and he went off before I came back as I had not any money left to give, I did not think a constable would come, I went out to try to get somebody to get a constable, I went out about six o'clock, I stayed a couple of hours, or thereabouts, I suppose.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever got any of your money again? - I never did, I was looking for him since, and I could not find him till he was taken last Saturday night. I had lodged in this house about five or six months, he lodged there some part of the time; he used to say, when I used to live hard and poorly to save that money, he used to tell me that others would piss it against the wall, he told me that just before he robbed me.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body else lay in the cellar? - There was the old man and Ryan, that is two, and two more, and my wife and two children, all in the same cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear any noise? - About a fortnight before the 1st of November, I was sitting by the fire, and Ryan was with me, where he expressed the words as these, it is a pity that Old Rogue should eat a bit of dry bread, when he has got a purse of gold in his pocket, I will take his breeches one night, and take his money out, and have a bit of fun with him, says he, we will have a bit of fun out of it; on this Saturday night, Ryan went out about eight to go to pay table, he came in about twelve o'clock, I let him in, and came into bed, then afterwards, I did not fall asleep for a long time; about an hour or an hour and half after, I heard a man getting up, and getting the other side where the other man used to sleep, I thought he was troubled with something, I did not take any notice, about six o'clock in the morning, this same old man, that lost his money bawled out, I jumped out of my bed, and asked him, what was the matter? says he, this man that lay by the side of me, has taken away my money, all that I have in the world, and has had his knife over me all of the time, says he, I was afraid of my life, that he would run me through.</p>

               <p>Jury. Was your bed there without a partition? - It was, there were three beds in the room, I jumped out of bed, and says I, what do you bawl for? and the old man went out to get a constable, and as soon as the man was out, Ryan slipped out, and I never set sight of him any more; Ryan went away about a quarter after six, I never saw him till last Saturday, I was ignorant about the law, I did not know whether it would allow me to take hold of the man without a constable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did I leave your house at six o'clock? - You did, or a little after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Saturday night I went to pay table, I was kept till eleven o'clock before my master paid us, I stayed out about an hour longer, and I came home about twelve and one, and went to my bed, I went to my bed, and lay there till about six o'clock in the morning, and then the old man said he was robbed, and he goes and gets a book, and they handed it to me, and I took my oath; I stayed there till eight o'clock, I never left about the place till twelve o'clock, when I went to get my dinner then, the next day I was ordered to Battle-bridge, where I have worked ever since, till such time as he came last Saturday night and took me; and Corbutt's wife said, his breeches were cut by a knife before he went to bed. I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Jury to Prosecutor. Was the prisoner in the house when you came back again? - He was not.</p>

I had made him no promises nor threats; that was my master's bridle; he had a woman along with him; he said to her, do you go and get Mr. Kaye's bridle; she did not bring it to me, so I told her when I see her again at the justice's, that she had not done according to the prisoner's bargain; he told her again to fetch it, and I went with her and we found it under a barrel, she heaved the barrel up on one side and I picked it up from under the barrel, this barrel was just the outside of the back door, just at his sitting room; then I said to her, woman if you know of any thing else that is hid, I will be glad if you will tell me; she told me where a coulter was hid on my master's premises with an intent to take off, but it was not taken. The prisoner at the bar said at the justice's, that neither me nor my master should not be alive at New year's day to prosecute him; he had worked for me about five weeks as a hay maker; I had discharged him on Wednesday, but not on this affair, as I found this out on Saturday.</p>

On Monday morning I went to work again as usual, on Tuesday I went again as usual, and was taken with the fit of the ague, and have been bad ever since. When I went up to Bow-street Chine paid me the part of the weeks wages that was due to me. I have no witness here.</p>
               <p>Court to Constable. How did you get the plough share? - I went to take this man and he produced the plough share out of his room, in another little room by; Webb told me he had put it in that room in the presence of the prisoner.</p>

               <p>I live in King-street, Golden-square; Augustine was not a servant of mine, he came from time to time, he went there to eat as I keep an eating-house; I lost a table clock the 15th of December, Saturday; I did not see the prisoner take it, I saw him there an hour after the clock was taken between eight and nine in the morning, it was brought by the pawnbroker; it was kept in my eating parlour; I had not seen Augustine in the house that morning before the clock was taken; I saw him about an hour after, he came into the house of his own accord, he came there generally as he used to do, to eat and drink, and I had no suspicion; it was a pendulum clock that I lost, which winds up every day, a table clock, it remained on the chimney piece; the pawnbroker has the clock.</p>
               <p>JONATHAN BAKER sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I live in Berwick-street, Oxford-road; I know the prisoner perfectly, he has pawned things with me at various times, he pawned the the table clock on Saturday the 15th of December between nine and ten o'clock in the morning; I gave a duplicate, he had 12 s. on it; I asked him how he came by it? he said, it was not his, it was his father and mothers', they give it him to pawn; the owner came about three days after it was pawned; he said, he knew the clock, and I took it to the justice's, and have kept it ever since. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went to dine and breakfast with that gentleman, and I met a frenchman whose name is Mitchell, whom I had met several times at the prosecutor's, I met him in Portland-street, he had a clock, he asked me where I was going? I said, I was going to breakfast; the frenchman told me he had no money, and that he had had that clock and he was desirous of pawning it; he told me if you will pawn it for me I will be obliged to you; he came with me to the pawnbroker's and waited at the door; I went into the pawnbroker's and pawned the clock for 12 s. I went out of the pawnbroker's and gave the frenchman the 12 s. in the street; he told me to keep the duplicate as it expressed that when I carried back the 12 s. to the pawnbroker's he would be entitled to it again; I put the ticket into my own pocket, Mitchell told me to do it; I lived eight years at No. 1, Holborn.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you taken any pains to find Mitchell? - I don't know where he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090032"/>lived, I had seen him several times at the place where we eat; I have nobody here, but if the court would send to No. 1, Holborn, the master would give me a character.</p>

               <p>Q. How happened it that you did not go back for them on the first day? - Why, they did not come when I stayed, but I find they did come afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know why you that had prosecuted this man, went home and and did not go to the guards to know why he was not brought? - I thought they would not come at all, I thought no more.</p>
               <p>Q. And the next day, Moore and Harrison were both carried to Bow-street? - Yes, I went with them, I went to St. James's that time, I went with them, I went there because they were going on guard, and there we went to take them; it was Friday I believe that we took them.</p>
               <p>Q. What night was it they came to your house? - Sunday night, on Monday, Harrison was carried before the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have been saying that it was the next day after that, that you took them from guard; now you recollect and say, it was Friday? - I am wrong, it was Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. From Monday till Friday, what did you do? - I did nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that? - Because I was informed they were to be on duty that day by some soldier, I do not know who it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you known Moore and Harrison before they used the house? - I know them very well by sight, I knew one of their names, Moore, but I did not know the other</p>
               <p>Q. Then on Monday, when you was at the guard, did you tell the serjeant that Moore was the other man? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Why were they not taken? - The serjeant said, he would bring them both up to the office, he told me so, and Mr. Townsend was with me.</p>

            Whether they were both brought to the office or not you cannot tell? - They told me so at the office the next day.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you seen your watch before? - I had my watch at the stroke of twelve, and pulled it out to shew them what o'clock it was.</p>
               <p>Q. I went to know why you waited till the Friday that they should be on duty, without going again and having them taken up? - I was very ignorant of the matter, I was told by some soldier that I should catch them, and he did not know how I should catch them before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had these men frequented your house before this? - I had not lived in the house but four days, I had seen them at another house that I kept, they knew that I knew them, I dare say, as for Harrison he never laid hold of me at all, because when the other three came about me he was sitting down, and I heard him say don't hurt the old man, and according to his voice, he was where they were before they laid hands on me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there is any thing given if a man who is not a grenadier puts on a grenadier's cap? - They make it a forfeit among one another, I believe I have heard it said, it is a forfeit, but I never saw it done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Moore. Did you miss the watch as soon as we were gone? - I did.</p>

            Why was the reason you did not make a complaint to the officer of the guard? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you give us a roll and better to look for the other two men? - I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090038"/>Prisoner Moore. We went up to Bow-street, and Mr. Sellwood was gone, Mr. Sellwood never came to seek after us till Friday, when he came with the constable here, and I was in the ranks in St. James's, he pointed to the constable at me, and said that was one of the men, Mr. Townsend spoke to the colonel of the guard, and I was called out of the ranks, I went into the sutling house to the serjeant, and Harrison was on centry; when he was off centry we all went up to Bow-street, where he said, he did not think we knew any thing about it, but we knew the men that had done it, we were committed down to Tothill-fields, and came up for examination on Tuesday following, Mr. Sellwood said then we were innocent of the affair, and wanted us to be discharged, and Mr. Addington committed us down to Newgate.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Harrison. He has been saying it was twelve o'clock when we went away, we were in the guard room by half after eleven; I went in first and had two pints of beer before this man came in, when I came back again, and we had one pot of beer first, and the other after, and we left these men behind us, the men I never saw in my life before; when I heard he had missed his watch in the morning, I went there to Mr. Sellwood, and he said he would give me any thing if I would go and find the two men, I asked him what I had to pay, I had had a pint of beer, and a roll and butter, and he said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Please you, my lord, Harrison, is as innocent as a baby of robbing me; but I never said so of Moore.</p>
               <p>The prisoners called two serjeants to their characters, who said they were honest men and good soldiers; and in the guard room that night by eleven at farthest.</p>
               <p>Court to Sellwood. I would wish to know of you, whether Harrison and the two men came in as one company, or whether they came in one after another? - They came in very nigh together, but Moore he came in after, he was the last, they all joined in one company, I understood them all to come in as one company, they never called for beer separate.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consider it as a joke, putting on the cap? - I thought they had done it for that; I resisted it at the first time, they did not get it done.</p>

               <p>Q. Whose cap was it? - It was Moore's cap, it was taken off Moore's head before, it was then on the table; it was one of the men in coloured clothes, that ran after me the first time to put it on my head.</p>

               <p>Q. In what capacity was he at your house? - He waited on us, he did every thing that was to be done.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use to give him your clothes? - I gave him one coat, I never gave him any of these things; finding these things in his box, we carried them to the office in Marlborough-street, and he was committed for trial.</p>
               <p>- WALLIN sworn.</p>
               <p>I executed the warrant on the prisoner, I found him in bed, and I got this key of the box out of his breeches pocket; I opened the box, and found all the things in the indictment, but the watch, these three waistcoats, a pair of breeches and two coats; when he was fully committed, Mr. Conant told me to go along with the prisoner, to see if I could find the watch, the watch was buried under ground in little Welbeck-street, the corner house of Wimpole-street; I went with the prisoner, he said it was under ground, but it was not, it was up a water trunk, I let the prisoner put his hands up, and he pulled it out, he produced it to me. (The things produced deposed to.) There was three guineas and a half found in his pocket; the notes were found in these black breeches pockets, they are two ten pounds bank notes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In regard that he says the notes were found in the black breeches pocket, they were not, they were found in a pair of kerseymere breeches pocket; - They were found in the right hand pocket of these black breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The second thing he said that he took the key of my box from my breeches pocket, I took it out of my coat pocket; as to my defence, I am left without counsel or witness, I am left entirely at the mercy of the jury; I have<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090040"/>witnesses to give me a character, but not knowing so suddenly of coming up to this court, I had not time to get them.</p>

Mrs. Dawson keeps a linen draper's shop, and sells ready made linen. (Produced.)</p>

I was coming from Paddington last Tuesday week; I had been to carry some work, and coming down Edward-street, I saw a man, that this<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090042"/>gentlewoman spoke to, and I saw him coming from the door; as I came by I saw this parcel and kicked it before me with my foot, I picked it up and went to a light to look at it, and was walking away in a very peaceable manner, and this gentleman came and took hold of me; I told him if it was his property, I am very willing to go to his shop, when I saw what it was, I put it under my coat; please you my lord, I think a thief always runs away when he steals things, I was walking very seriously away.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you look to see how the people had got in? - They came in at a back window that is on the stair case.</p>
               <p>Q. What appearance was there that any body had got in there? - One pane of glass was broke, and they put their hand in and took out the staple, and that window was open when I came home, the window is almost one story from the ground, there is a wash-house underneath, and a water-butt, so they got on the water-butt, and then on the wash-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see whether there was any appearance of feet? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Mr. Clarke. Did you see how the people had got in? - There was the marks of somebody's feet on the water-butt; they had broken some of the laths of the railing which parts one yard from the other, the water-butt stands in the next yard close against the wall, from whence they got up to the wash-house apparently, and broke the pane of glass, and did the business, the wash-house being low.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they get the double lock open? - They forced the screws out, one screw was forced out into the middle of the room.</p>

               <p>I am street keeper and patrole of Houndsditch; on Sunday evening the 6th of January, between six and seven I saw the prisoner Wall coming up the street, and I saw him turn round Gravel-lane, I observed he had got something under his waistcoat; this might be a quarter of a mile from the prosecutrix's, I stopped him and asked him what he had got? he said, he had got a quart pot, it was underneath his jacket, he told me his mother gave it him; with that I asked him where he was going to take it, he said, he was going to take it into Petticoat-lane to sell it, I let him go, and he took it to Mr. Crocker's house, he told me what house he was going to; I know the prisoner at the bar, because he is a ward constable, he keeps an old iron shop; the boy went in and sold the pot, the boy was in my custody when he sold it, I stood at the door, he sold it for 6 d. I did not see him sell it, because there was a bit of a screen; the boy came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090045"/>to the threshold of the door, and I went in, and asked Mr. Crocker what he had done with the pot that the boy brought in, and he was very much alarmed with that, he was sitting near the fire, and between him and the fire place he put his hand round, and gave me the pot, the pot was between him and the fire place, in the same state it is now in, not melted or any thing; I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself; the boy told me he gave him 6 d. in his presence, and there was a woman there took the 6 d. from him; I don't know what the value of the pot may be.</p>
               <p>Q. This 6 d. may not be then very much below the mark for an old pot? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crocker. I wish to ask him whether he did not keep the boy at the Nag's Head, in Houndsditch, and offered him money to tell him where he was going with the pot? - I offered no money, the boy told me voluntarily; I knew very well it was a suspicious character where he was a going to.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did the boy tell you he was going to sell the quart pot at one Crocker's? - He did not say he was going to one Crocker's first, but to one Freer's to the best of my knowledge, but I knew the house, and I knew it was Crocker's; I know every house in the ward; I told the boy to go where he was going to sell it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you take him into the Nag's Head? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you detain him there? - Not above half a minute.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crocker. Did not you take him to another house? - I did to get Box, another officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the constable in bed or up? - I was not up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you detain him till Box got up, and then you all came together? - The boy went up first and I followed him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take the pain that he should go with you then and not to bring him here now? - Because the alderman did not think it necessary, and besides, my Lord, there are back doors, and that was the reason; Petticoat-lane is not a very agreeable place; he was to have been sworn in the next day as ward constable, he is not sworn in now; I have kept the pot ever since. (Produced and deposed to.)</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. What is that pot worth? - We give 1 l. 2 s. a dozen, the maker said it was worth 1 s. 2 d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wall. I was playing in Little Moorfields, and I saw that pot stand by in the street among more pots in a string, the pots were taken away and this pot was left, and this man when I went to sell some old iron bars, said if I could get any quart pots, or any thing of that sort, he would buy it of me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crocker. I have no interest in the shop, nor did I buy it, or pay for it, I have another employ to get my living.</p>
               <p>Court to Tipper. Did you examine the boy, and see that he had the sixpence? - The woman that is Mr. Croker's servant I believe, took the 6 d. from the boy as soon as he came in the second time.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know whether you got that 6 d. of the boy? - I did not; while I went back to Crocker, the woman stopped the boy, and took the 6 d. out of his hand, the boy was in the shop all the while I went to Crocker, I did not see her do it, only what the boy told me; I would have apprehended the woman, but only he begged and prayed of me not to do it, and I thought it was enough to take him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Crocker. I had witnesses here this morning, but I was told the indictment was not found.</p>
               <p>Wall's mother was called, and she said, he lived at home, worked in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090046"/>cotton way, and always had been a good boy.</p>

I told him I thought he did not want to buy; he turned from the counter, to go to the door, and I followed him; as he was on the step of the door, I observed his hand in his pocket, as if pushing something in his pocket; I took hold of his arm and I said, my lad have you got something there, he replied yes, and produced one of my shawls out of his pocket; I took him back into the shop, and sent for a constable, when the constable came, he took him out of the shop door, before he thought to search him, and he brought him in again; on searching him, he found two more callico shawls in his pocket; I saw them taken out by the constable; ther first shawl has the private mark of our shop upon it Y, and a stroke, and then an R; the other two shawls had not that mark on them, but we have the corresponding patterns, which were on the wrapper, which was on the counter at that time; I did not see the prisoner near the wrapper at any time; we cannot tell whether we missed any of these things; but one that was taken out of his pocket, was the only one we had of the pattern.</p>

My father sent me word up that he would send me word, when he had notice to go to receive it; my father's answer returned before I left London; when I got to Coventry he left me about half an hour, he said he was going to speak to one Mr. Wilmer, about his 200 l. legacy, when he came back he said Mr. Wilmer was not certain whether it was due to him or not, he should consult his attorney; we went from there to Litchfield, and stopped there one night, and then we got to Birmingham we went to the Saracen's Head; he slept there, and sent me to my father to ask about the legacy, and not to tell him that he was in town; my father knew him, but my father did not know he was come to London with me for certain; I went to my father and I slept there all night; I asked him, if he knew when the money was to be received, he told me the next Friday, then I came to the prisoner, at the Saracen's Head, he told me not to stop at Birmingham, says he, we will go to Litchfield; we went to Litchfield and stopped till Thursday; he said he did not like for any body to know that he was down there; I did not enquire the reason;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090048"/>I heard from the prisoner's representation, there had been a quarrel, between the prisoner and some people at Birmingham, I knew not that myself; on Thursday we returned then to Wolverhampton, where the legacy was to be received, and I met my father at Wolverhampton, and we received the 100 l. on Friday; we put up at the sign of the Bell, at Wolverhampton, and my father was appointed to meet me at the Angel, the prisoner gave him that direction; I met my father in the street just by the inn, and my father told me the money was to be received a fortnight after that Friday of the executor, for he had not got all the money in; the prisoner sent, he wanted to see my father, I brought my father to him, at his inn, at the Bell; he said to my father it would be useless my staying any longer on expence, that he was going to London, and I should go with him; and wanted him to ask the executor to let me have the money before the others; my father and the prisoner went to the executor, and the prisoner asked the executor to let me have the money, the executor took him for an attorney; the prisoner told me so, that the executor thought he was an attorney, he at first desired to have my whole 400 l. then he asked to let me have 200 l. and then he asked to let me have an 100 l. we got that, my father gave him a note of indemnity, it was paid in 18 l. cash, and the rest in country Bank notes; one of 10 l. and the rest five guinea notes, they were of Birmingham, and Wolverhampton, and Stafford Bank; him and my father, and me, we then went down to this Bell inn, and the prisoner went out to get a sixpenny stamp for me to give my father a receipt for the 100 l. and he wrote a pattern for me to write a receipt upon; I copied that, and my father gave me the money, and my father came with me as far as Bilson, about three miles from Wolverhampton; the prisoner told my father, that he was going to Birmingham, and he would take my father home to Birmingham; my father said he would go as far as Westbury, and there he would sleep; the prisoner told my father he was going strait down to Birmingham, my father expected to see him the next day at Birmingham, at his house; but instead of his going strait there, the prisoner drove off towards Litchfield, and we slept at Litchfield that night, he told me he would go to Birmingham then, but instead of that he drove off to London; in the road he stopped at Coventry, and was gone about half an hour, he said he went to Mr. Wilmer, and said that Mr. Wilmer said that the money was come due, and he could pay him some time in February, we arrived in London about the 19th of December; the next day I took the horse to the Spotted Dog in the Strand, I left it there, I did not go home that night, me and my two fellow apprentices went to the play; the next morning I went to see my uncle, and this prisoner was at my uncle's; my uncle lives in Cloth Fair; the prisoner called me out, and asked me to lend him 30 l. and said he would pay on Saturday, and he gave me a note for it, I have got that note here. (Produced.) I told him I should go out of town to Birmingham on Friday, he said I might as well go back to his house, and stop till I went out of town, it would be expensive to stop in town; I went back to his house; this was Thursday evening; on Friday morning, he says to me Tom, give me those notes; and I will go over to Mr. Stenson's, and get them cashed for you, you will rip them or lose them, or some mischief or another with them. Mr. Stenson lived over the way facing the prisoner's house, he is a mercer, I gave him the notes; six five guineas and two 10 l. notes, all of country Banks; they were those I received in the country, of what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090049"/>particular Banks, each were I cannot tell I delivered them to him, to get them cashed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you expect he would give you cash, I did; I parted with them to receive the cash; he brought me back the cash for a 10 l. about a quarter of an hour after, he said Mr. Stenson had got no more cash, this was about nine or ten on Friday morning, he said he would cash the remainder in town; I went with him to town, because I was going to dine with my uncle about one o'clock in the afternoon; I saw him again about nine o'clock at night, at his house at Kensington; I asked him for my notes, he says what notes? I never had any notes of you, nor nothing do I owe you, and nothing will I pay you; we quarrelled that night; on Saturday morning we got up and breakfasted, I did not speak to him then, but I went and spoke to him before he went out; he went out, and I went into the yard, I heard him say he was going to a neighbour's house for whom he had a tea urn to japan, I stopped in the house about half an hour, waiting for him to come in, he did not come in, I went to this neighbour's house and asked for such a person as he was not there; I came to London to my uncle; I heard of him the Tuesday night afterwards Christmas night; he was advertised in the paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any letter after he left Kensington? - One Mr. Charters did make an appointment, at a particular place for the purpose of receiving the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you attend at that place? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Mr. Charters? - He lives in the same house with my uncle. I went at eight o'clock that morning according to the appointment of the letter, and a broker's cart was at the door, he had sold all his goods; I did not see him till the Saturday following I believe; at the time I gave him these notes, I gave them him for no other purpose than for him to get them changed.</p>

               <p>Q. Is your father here? - He is not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live in St. John's-street, I am a coach-maker and japanner, I employ from sixty to eighty men.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the young Otely at any time in your service? - He was about five months with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a weekly servant or how? - When he first applied to our manufactory he was in a deplorable situation, he came as a journeyman for the first, second, or three weeks, after which time he wished to be articled for three years, it was his own desire, he behaved in a very base manner indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Is he such a lad that you would believe on his oath? - I would not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he leave your service or did you turn him away? - He left our service without our knowledge, him and another young fellow stole several patterns which was a material consequence to our manufactory.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any means to find out this young Otely? - I applied to know if any one had seen Otely cut them patterns, I had a warrant against him, advertised him in the Birmingham papers, I did not succeed in finding him out till about a month ago, I overtook him in St. John's-street.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. It is very possible you can help us to the date when you applied to get this warrant? - No I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I can help you to it very soon; on your oath, was it not on the very day the prisoner was under examination? - It was not; there was two warrants, one to apprehend him in Birmingham, that was some time about May or June.</p>
               <p>Q. Before whom did you make that information? - Before justice Clarke.</p>
               <p>Q. There was another warrant as a runaway apprentice, the day the prisoner was examined? - There was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090052"/>Q. You had forgot the charge of felony then - The young fellow that was in the office is ill in Birmingham infirmary.</p>
               <p>Q. Who invited you to make that charge that day? - No body invited me but what is just.</p>
               <p>Q. Then just or unjust who invited you to Bow-street? - No body.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the prisoner send for you to come there and make the charge? - The prisoner sent for me.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't repeat the question, answer it. - Give me time to recollect myself; the prisoner acquainted me that he was in custody, on the charge of Otely, and that if I wanted an opportunity of making him my prisoner, then was my time.</p>
               <p>Q. No body invites me but what is just; the prisoner did tell me that he was in custody, on a charge of Otely, and that if I wanted an opportunity of making him my prisoner, then was my time. Mr. Strickland, when was it you had that invitation to come and do what is just, perhaps you have got the letter in your pocket that he sent to you? - No, I have not, he sent a verbal message.</p>
               <p>Q. By whom was it sent? - I don't know to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear you have not seen him to day? - I will.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the message? - That Mr. Harbidge was a prisoner, and that I wanted an opportunity of finding Otely, I might meet him there on his examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you produce the warrant at Bow-street, you had taken out before? - No, it is in the country.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you even hint at it? - I did to the clerk, I wanted a warrant for both felony and as a run-away apprentice, but I could not bring the young man that see him put the patterns in his handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. And so he refused the warrant; do you know the clerk's name? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been acquainted with the prisoner? - I believe he has been at different times at our manufactory for three, four or five months, I don't know what way of life he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever sell you any goods? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the reason on which you say you would not believe this young man on his oath? - Upon account of his misconduct in our manufactory, his conduct was so base, damning and blasting his eyes and limbs, and instead of attending to his business six days, he used to attend to it three; and many other things, his behaviour in every part whatever was bad.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps one might help you, perhaps he might represent to you, that you ought to allow him 4 s. in the pound more. What was the money that was stipulated? - He was paid on common prices.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you the articles there? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Produce them; was that twenty per cent. the usual article in your manufactory? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear that five made you an allowance of twenty per cent. in December 1791? - I think I could say ten did.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you believe five out of sixty made you that allowance? - I will swear nothing but what is fact; there is not above twenty in this line.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you believe that out of the twenty there were five that allowed you twenty per cent? - I think I could swear there were ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the young man make that representation as I have before stated? - He cheated besides, he borrowed money and never paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Of whom? - Of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What more than the twenty per cent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. The reason that you made no complaint of felony against him<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090053"/>was because a material witness was ill in Birmingham? - He was, or I would have sent for him up.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he keep to his hours? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you believe him on his oath? - I would not believe him in any shape, I never saw him steady in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Any other reason? - I believe he was concerned in taking a great many patterns, I know a great many patterns were missing, I missed them myself, I am the person that takes care of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did he ever say any thing to you about the riots at Birmingham? - He told me he was concerned in pushing out the pulpit in the old Meeting house at Birmingham, he used to go on in that strange manner; I assisted in pushing out the pulpit at the old Meeting house, he used to swear Church and King.</p>

               <p>Last Tuesday afternoon, the Prisoner at the bar came into the shop, and asked to look at some waistcoats, I shewed the prisoner at the bar three or four, and then he asked to look at some breeches, I shewed him some, the prisoner after looking at a few pair tried two pair on; after that he gave them to me, and says, put these two pair of breeches by, I shall have one pair of them; then he put his own breeches on, and came and looked at the breeches by the light, and then he said he would give me no more than half a guinea for them; then the prisoner stood at the door a few minutes, and says he, I am sorry I cannot deal with you, as I have given you so much trouble, and he walked out of the shop for about six yards, and I collared him and brought him into the shop again, I told him I thought he had got a pair of my breeches in his breeches, he seemed quite alarmed at that; I told him if he did not unbutton his breeches<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090055"/>I would unbutton them for him, he took and unbuttoned the two flaps, and pulled his breeches down, and I saw my breeches; I called to my wife and said here is a man got a pair of our breeches in his breeches, and then I sent for a constable; I took him and the breeches to the Rotation-office, and the constable had them till yesterday about ten o'clock, when the constable gave them to me; I had no mark on them, no more than the shop mark; the shop mark is not a mark of my making, it is to tell the size they are, what we call a long sour's, it is the man's mark that supplies me with breeches; I am certain they are my breeches, but I could not miss any, I have got several dozen pair in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the shop mark is put on by the man that sells them to you; does not he put on the same mark to different shops? - He does.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not possible for the man to have bought these breeches at another shop with that mark? - Yes, it is possible, but it is very improbable; when I was pulling the breeches out of his breeches, he said don't, don't, that was all he said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was in liquor. - He did not appear to be so.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. What did I say first when I came into the shop? - He said he wanted to look for some waistcoats and breeches.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I went into the shop, I asked to look at some velveret breeches, I wanted some pretty good ones, he shewed me some, and I looked a pair out, which I thought would fit me, and I asked what they were to be, and I cannot be sure whether he said 15 s. or 14 s. but it was one of the two, and I think to the best of my remembrance I bid him 12 s. and 10 s. 6 d. and he would not take it, I said I think these would fit me, I pulled my own off, and put these breeches on, and if I pulled two pair down, it is more than I know, I was in liquor, and therefore I put on these breeches, they fitted me very well, and when he found the breeches afterwards hanging out here behind, I did not know I had them about me, when I had my own on.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Were they folded up? - They were, and I saw the prisoner conniving at these breeches in his own breeches, in order to put them up.</p>

               <p>Court to Allen. Proceed. - Between the hours of three and five in the afternoon, the prisoner at the bar came and offered me some lace to pledge; from the number of yards I supposed it might not be her property. I asked her whose it was; she said it was the property of some person who was in distress, without saying whom; afterwards there was some words passed between us and she said I might send for an officer; I told her I thought it was not her property, and I would send for an officer; an officer came, and she was taken to the office and committed for re-examination. I have had the lace in my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090057"/>possession ever since it was shewn to the prosecutor at the office.</p>

            . The lace was in the shop on the 13th of December, Thursday; we counted the laces on that day, both in the shop and in the warehouse, and they appeared to be perfectly right then; so that that lace was in our possession the 13th of December; they were right by comparing them with the books. I know the pattern exceeding well; I do not recollect the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that when you counted all the laces, you can tell that that piece was there with that quantity? - I can swear that the lace was right that day; we had such a pattern in the house that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say that you had a piece of lace of that identical size on that card? - The quantity was seventy-two yards and a half. We do not examine the quantity of the yards; we only count the number of the cards; we count them once a week; the card is marked 1850. We never look at the patterns; nor do we particularly look at the numbers; we had lace of that number on the card; on that day I examined them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, as you look through the book, examine the lace and see that your laces correspond to the numbers in the book? - We do; and further I can say, this lace never was sold; we never sell a card-lace out of our shop. Whenever we sell a card-lace we always cut the number and ticket off, and we know it is not sold by our wholesale books.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I believe you told us a little while ago, that when you are running over the laces, you do not attend to the patterns? - We do not.</p>
               <p>Q It was the 13th of December when the laces were counted over; and it certainly must be there, or it would not be put down in the book. - I only know by this, that if it had not been there, then we should have found one card short. I counted them; and another young man in the shop, he counts the shop and I count the warehouse. I took the numbers that he counted on a piece of paper.</p>
               <p>Q. But whether he counted them right or not must depend on him? - I took the account as he gave it me.</p>
               <p>Q. You relied on him to be correct? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And he is not here? - He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. He counted the cards in the shop; and you counted the cards in the warehouse? - I took the account from him of the quantity that he had counted.</p>
               <p>Q. He took the shop laces; therefore he was the man that knew whether the shop laces were right or not? - There is no doubt but what he counted them right.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this a shop lace or a warehouse lace? - It had been in the shop a week; I recollect this very card in the shop; I recollect the pattern being there. I do not say that I recollect this pattern that day; but I recollect having seen both pattern and card in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you say the card again; you said before you did not look at the pattern or number, but only go by the tale? - We do.</p>
               <p>Court to Flint. How do you know this lace to be your's? - I know it by several things; first of all here is the mark 1850; and here is another number, 9525, both of which has a reference to my book; the one has a reference to the man's bills of parcels of whom I bought it of, No. 9525, and 1850 refers to my piece account; I have the bills of parcels and the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Who keeps that book? - This young man and another and my wife. We enter every card of lace by the number;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090058"/>and we enter our own number likewise; we put down the quantity of yards we put the cost mark, and we put the selling mark. If they should happen to tally, if they answer to the quantity that this book warrants them to be, they are past over as right. If there should be any missing, it is wrote down missing such a day; that book contains the warehouse account and the shop account; there is no separate account.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the account taken in the shop and the account taken in the warehouse are taken by different people? - They cannot but be taken by different people, because one person cannot take them alone.</p>
               <p>Q. May not the warehouse account be taken by one man, and the shop account by another? - No; because one calls the lace, and the other checks the book against it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why have you not brought the other persons? - I could not spare the time that I have lost already.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you another young man that took the account with this witness? - I have; but I can tell that the account was past on the 13th and found right. I can swear to that; and he can swear the same if he swears the truth; we never sell a card of lace with the marks on it; the number is always cut off and put into a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are not in the habit of selling; nor never do sell a card of lace in the shop with the numbers on; but might not this have been sold to a wholesale customer? - Had this been sold to a wholesale customer, the No. 1850, the quantity of yards and the private marks would have been in the wholesale book.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the number 9525, what do you know by that? - My Lord, there is the numbers, there is the quantity, and there is the prices, all in plain figures, as plain as an A,

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. These cards, when you sell to an wholesale customer, are entered in an wholesale book; and that book is not here? - It is not here; we must be very hardy to come here and affront you.</p>
               <p>Court to Smith. With regard to the shop laces, how were the business carried on between you and the other young man, on the 13th of December? - We counted them on a piece of paper, the young man counted in the shop, and I in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Your master said it was done different? - It was taken by two, one counted and the other checked the book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Flint. Give me leave to explain.</p>
               <p>Court. You swore positively and decidedly how it was done; your servant has explained it to be done in a different manner, and now you want to make general observations upon it, the Court will not endure it. I do not mean to impute to you or the servant; but if the accounts do not exactly tally, it is our duty to see whether they exactly tally or not, servants do not at all times do as their master orders them.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave her an exceeding good character, particularly her master whom she lived with at the time, at Old Ford, when this affair happened.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I produce a tea caddy; I stopped the prisoner at the bar with it on Tuesday the 18th of December between seven and eight in the evening, she brought it to our house to pledge; I had information that such a thing was lost, and I stopped it; I asked whose it was? she first of all told me it was her husband's; I told her I had a suspicion it was stole in the neighbourhood, I told her I would send for him, and she would wait till he come; she then said, she would tell me the truth, it belonged to a lodger of her's. I have kept it ever since; I have known her some years, and always thought her a very honest industrious woman.</p>

               <p>I am a watch finisher by trade; I had just got out of bed and got to my window, and I saw the prisoner at the bar lift up his hand and take these trowsers from the nail; I drove up the window and called out Broderick, Broderick, the man has robbed you of the trowsers; by that time the prisoner had got about five or six yards, and I see him drop the trowsers when he heard me call; Broderick called to me which man is it? says I, the second man, the man in the brown coat, he had a companion; I saw Broderick run after him about twenty yards, and I am sure he is the man I saw about two hours after at the justice's, and I am sure it is the same man that took the breeches; when he came down to the justice's he had on a brown coat.</p>

               <p>I am a poor working man; I did not see the man take the things; I heard the alarm, and I pursued; I did not loose sight of him from the first alarm till he was taken; Broderick pointed out to me the man I was to follow; he turned down the lane into Blue Anchor-yard; when I catched him, he begged I would let him go; he said, it was all a joke,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090061"/>and then the constable came up and took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Be so good to ask him whether he did not come into the place, where I was locked up, and said, he was very sorry that he had taken me, for he believed I was not the man that took them. - I said, I was sorry that I took him, because it hindered me my time in being obliged to go before the magistrate.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My lord it was between seven and eight o'clock, I was going to my work, going by the door the prosecutor he was reading the news paper, and he asked me if I wanted to buy any thing? I was rather in liquor, and he took hold of my arm, and I told him I did not, and he gave me a shove, and the trowsers were taken off the door, and the other gentleman called out to him the trowsers were taken off the door, the person ran down the street, and I went after them both, and went as far as this turning, and there we lost the other man, and they immediately laid hold of me, and they took me into a public house very nigh, and we had two or three pots of purl, we set there very near an hour and then he went and fetched this gentleman from across the way.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There is not one word true; I did not drink a drop of purl with him, the constable took him into the public house he called for a pint of purl and drank it himself in the corner.</p>

               <p>I belong to the store-keeper's office at Deptford, Dock-yard; the prosecutor, Woodford, is employed in that Dockyard, I have been acquainted with him fifteen or twenty years; I have frequently seen him write, there is a resemblance; but there wants something in it, the last letter of his name is not turned as I usually see him do it. (Another paper shewn him.) This is the manner; but it is something fuller than this.</p>
               <p>Q. From the whole observation of that paper do you believe that is his signature? - As it appears to me now, I believe it not to be his hand writing, there is a great resemblance in the other letters; but for want of that turn I cannot say that it is his writing particularly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Feilding. The first bond that you have seen, you say that that, bears a resemblance, but you think there is some difference on the turn of the D? - There is.</p>
               <p>Q. You think there is also some difference in the turn of the D, in the second instrument that is shewn to you by Mr. Garrow? - I think it is not so full.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. In general you say that the stroke of the D was fuller than in the first instrument? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Feilding. Be so good as to look at any of these signatures, and see if any one is the hand writing of Woodford's. (Looks at some more signatures.) - The first is.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the second and third; - The third D is not turned up, I think the second is his hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at the hand. - I think it is his hand writing, but it is not as I have seen him write.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at all his writing, and see what you think about it. - I think it is all his writing, except the D is not turned in the usual way.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Look at this name, (another signature shewn him.) Do you think this is his hand writing? - I believe it is, this is in the manner I have been used to see him write.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Smith, the prisoner? - I know nothing of the transaction.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at that, if you believe that to be his signature? - There is a difference to that which I have been accustomed to see, there is a difference in the turn of the D.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this. (Looks at another.) - Not quite so full as this, but similar.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this. (Looks at another.) - Something like this.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on the whole of the signature to that bond, looking at it, and examining it, do you or do you not, believe it is Woodford's writing? - It bears such a similitude, I cannot be on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. You are not expected to speak positively either one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have acted on that, as an instrument of his? - I should.</p>

I saw that bundle on the stairs as I went up, that bundle contained wearing apparel of mine that was left.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that contain all the property that had been taken out of the room? - All but what was stated in the indictment; I lost two black mode cloaks of my own, a silver pepper box, two silver table spoons, four gold rings, a pair of ear rings, a gold pin, a punch ladle, a snuff box, the rings were in it, a pair of shoe buckles, and a dollar, a cotton gown and coat, and a linen pillow case of my mother's, besides what was in the bundle. When I saw the bundle on the stairs, I was in hopes that I had come time enough to prevent the robbery; the carpet was left all in the ruck, and the room was in very great confusion.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the things of the value you have mentioned in the indictment? - Yes, three times the value.</p>

What were the things you desired taken off the premises? - The rings which were left in the room; one I saw, there were four I understood, I could see only one positively, previous to that they took this pillow case away, and before I heard that the robbery was committed, the pillow case was there when they came in first, it appeared to be full, full nearly however, when they came in, Douglas brought a basket, and took it away in the basket, Douglas and Spencer together, I don't know where they carried it; they immediately took the rings away when I desired them, they were given into Douglas's hands, he took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it you saw Douglas there the first time? - It was about ten minutes to two; they came in, the pillow case was taken away, they might be absent about a quarter of an hour, and returned, and then I heard of the robbery, and I desired that these rings should be taken off the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either of them say any thing about these things? - The things were taken away, I had no conversation about what the contents of the pillow case was at that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090072"/>Q. At any other time? - I don't recollect my thing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Do you work at your trade now Mr. Wood? - No, I am employed in the spinning manufacture, and I have been dealing in tow, and various other articles to get a livelihood.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately have you been a weaver of horse hair? - I am a horse hair weaver in right of my father; I live as a waiter sometimes, especially in the summer season.</p>
               <p>Q. How lately have you earned one day's work at horse hair weaving? - Not this twenty years; I live at Hornsey-house in the summer time, I am in the horse hair manufactory now.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't understand you to say that you knew the rings again you saw at your sister's? - Here is one ring I do swear to, that I saw at my sister's. (The ring deposed to by

(Produces a bag.) The mutton, potatoes, turnips and carrots, were all in one bag, and I carried it in my left hand across the Goat-yard where I live, and I carried it in my left hand down by the side; so in coming into my own door way, I met Mrs. Collis, says she, how do you do Joe, says I, how are you; I cut off a piece of the breast of mutton, and cut it off for my dinner; my father says Joe, we have no deal, I went to Mr. Smith's, in Beech-lane, to buy a leaf of deal, I bought this, and I comes up Whitecross-street. I put it along side Mrs. Pally's door, I went into Mrs. Pally's, and called for a pint of beer, when I called for a pint of beer, Mrs. Pally says, O Spencer you have robbed me, says I, madam, I never robbed you in my life, nor nobody else, with that, says she, Mr. Douglas, I wish you would take care of Spencer till I send for an officer, says I, madam, you have no call to ask any body to take care of me, I will sit down till an officer comes; I sat down, and when an officer came, they took up my brother with me, and my father, and another young man and woman, when we came before his worship in Hog-lane,

               <p>Q. Who was at your lodgings that day? - My brother.</p>
               <p>Q. Was either of the two prisoners there? - No, not at all during the day.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing of the white bag then? - No, I have seen Mr. Douglas several times, but nothing further than washing for him; I did not see Spencer there, nor Douglas, while my brother was there; my brother came up to me, and I asked him to fetch me a pint of purl, and in pulling out the money to give him to pay for it, I pulled out these rings in my hand, I heard about Mr. Pally's house being robbed at two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother say any thing to you about taking the things out of the house? - No.</p>
               <p>Court to Wood. You hear what your sister says? - Yes, my Lord, and it is a very grievous matter to hear it; Mr. Rogers knows I went to him and related the circumstances, I cannot say positively as to the day.</p>
               <p>Court to Rogers. When did he come to you? - After the prisoners were fully committed, on the 25th of December, he came to me to acquaint me that he saw a bag of a white pillow case at his sister's, and he mentioned the four rings in particular; he mentioned to me, that he saw Spencer in Douglas's room while he was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you advertised the reward? - Yes. He then acquainted me also, that he saw Douglas put the white bag in a basket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Douglas. Why did not the man, if he was a fair man go and tell it directly.</p>

On the 15th of December we went up into the room, and we had a suspicion that the things were gone, and I asked her where they were? and she said, they were in the room; she was in the room; I insisted on seeing of them, and threatened to fetch an officer; on that she quitted the place; I searched for the things and they were missing; she came again in the evening and said, if I would let her have the duplicates out of the room she would get the things; I am sure I let her the things with the room; she had the duplicates, and I never saw her till the next evening; I found the duplicates in the apartment on Saturday evening; on Tuesday evening I took an headborough with me, and I found her at the Jolly Sailors in Ratcliff-highway at a public house; from thence I took her down to Mr. Staples's office, and on searching her the duplicates were found, Mr Staples committed her till the Thursday evening following, when the things were brought up before the magistrate by the pawnbroker; the things are here.</p>
               <p>Q. You let her go at first when you first went up into the room? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You then insisted on seeing whether the things were there or not, and when you found them not there how came you to let her go? - She went away not known to me; she came back again of her own accord on the evening, and then said they were pawned, and said, if I would give her the duplicates she would fetch the things; she once pawned things before of mine, it was a sheet, and I don't know whether it was fetched out or left in.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before the 15th of December? - I cannot tell exactly; but I believe it was got back.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to know she had pawned it? - By going up stairs and missing it; my wife knew that it was pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came and desired you to let her have the duplicates, you let her have the duplicates expecting her to bring the things, you did not consider her as having stolen them? - I only gave her the duplicates supposing that she meant to return them back again, I conceived so.</p>
               <p>Q. Your wife is not here? - She is not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did the pot go with him? - I took neither him nor the pot, the young woman picked it up afterward, and the quart pot the soldier took to Mr. Smith's house.</p>
               <p>Court to Ewer. Did you carry a quart pot there? - I did not carry the quart pot there; but I was along with the people that did; who did carry it I cannot say, for there was a good many of us.</p>
               <p>Court to Cadwell. Did you deliver the pot to the soldier? - I did.</p>
               <p>Court to Ewer. Did you receive the pot of Mr. Cadwell? - I did not; I saw another man receive it, and I saw it carried to Mr. Smith, and it was the same pot.</p>
               <p>Court to Cadwell. What was the name on the pot? - Smith.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was the prisoner at your house that day? - He had been about three quarters of an hour from the time they brought him back.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see a pot at that time? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now when the pot was brought back how do you know that quart pot was your's? - I know it by my own name, and I know it by my own sign.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a publican? - Many years; the man confessed to myself in Gaol; when I took him to the compter he cried and said, it was the first time he ever did such a thing in his life; I desired him to confess it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the pot, it was taken from under the table, I kicked my foot rather against it, this gentleman took it up and looked at it and said, it did not belong to the house, I must have brought it in; I never saw the pot till it was taken from under the table; I work with my father at carpentering.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I know nothing at all about it; I never was in trouble before in my life; I was coming home from my work; I had been and earned a shilling and fetched that hat out of pawn which the gentleman took away from me.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutrix. How happens it you was more positive the next day than<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090080"/>the day before? - I could not give charge; I said at the watch-house that the prisoner was the man, but I would not give charge.</p>
               <p>Court to Satwell. Your evidence was that she would not swear to the man? - I asked her in the watch-house if she knew the man; she said, she did not.</p>

            , and he brought me a warrant down; I went to the King's head in Wood-street, there I found the defendant Crosfield in custody with the bail and Mr. Wilson, Mr. Wilson wished me to execute the writ; but I objected to do it, because he was in custody of his bail. In some other transactions we went to Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Wilson expressly wished me to execute that warrant; I objected to executing the writ because Mr. Clowes, the plaintiff in the writ, was one of the bail in the former transaction, and it was by his consent that I should not execute that writ; that he said in the hearing of the prisoner Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr. Wilson say? - He did not say any thing than that he desired me to execute it; I did not execute it, I took it away with me and left the defendant<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090081"/>in custody of his bail; there was much conversation about it, but I thought it not proper to execute it; I recommended the bail to take the defendant Crosfield into Middlesex. In about half an hour after the bail brought the defendant Crosfield to my house, and Mr. Wilson was with them; the bail stayed with me till about eleven, and they left the defendant; I conceived it to be on this writ, Mr. Wilson went away in the coach with them, Mr. Wilson did not stop at all; I detained him on this transaction.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. What time was it they came first to your house? - About six or seven o'clock.</p>

This was on the 11th that he told me this, that the government did not suffer, for there was another writ sued out on Monday.</p>

               <p>About ten minutes before five in the morning, on the 24th of December, I was walking in Oxford-street, near Bird-street; there is a public house at the corner; under whose tap room window I saw this wheel barrow stand, with this piece of quartering laid across the barrow, covered up with a bit of old canvass, which gave me great suspicion that they could not be lawfully there at that time of the morning; with that the publican came out to undo the flap of the cellar window. I asked him if there was any body in that house that would own that barrow. I stopped there about a couple of minutes till I saw some body come out; the prisoner at the bar came out; I asked him how he came at that time of the morning to be with that barrow; he said he was sent by his master who was one Mr. Bell, who lived in Long-acre. I asked him when his master sent him, he told me that the night before his master ordered him to go at four o'clock in the morning. I asked him where he lived, he said he lived in Long-acre. I asked him at what time he left Long-acre, he said at four o'clock. I said my friend how came you to go so quick, to go up to Paddington and come all this way back, and he owned he had been a quarter of an hour in the public house; I then took him to the watch-house; I said he must go before the constable of the night; the constables of the night is here; and I took him to the justice's the same day; the bit of quartering and the garden pots are at the watch-house; the barrow is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did Haynes see at the watch-house? - He saw the wheel barrow, the two bits of quartering, and twenty-nine garden pots.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I belong to the Bow-street office. I am constable at St. Clement's; he said he had got a warrant, but he could get nobody to serve it; he and I went up to a public house in Lewkener's lane, and he was smoaking a pipe, the first public house down, the sign I don't know; we went in first and the man was not there, about ten or eleven o'clock we went there again, in about an hour and a half after, and then the man was there smoaking his pipe; I told him after the first time he had better go his rounds and cry his clothes and then we would go up again; we went again, and there the man was smoaking his pipe. I knew him the moment I went into the house as soon as I came into the house, the prisoner was there, I told him to put his pipe down he must go with me; he was in the room at the edge of the bar, rather more in the tap room than in the passage; the room was full of men and women; I told him to put down that pipe and go with me; that was the first thing that passed.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a constable? - Three or four years.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090087"/>Q. Where was the prosecutor? - The prosecutor was just gone in before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you are the man I want, or was it the prosecutor pointed out the man to you? - The prosecutor went in first, and when I went in I said, you are the man I want; I took him on the prosecutor's description.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor point him out to you, or had he given you such a description of him as you could have taken him without? - No, I could not have taken him without his description. He put his pipe down and came directly very quietly, he dropped it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prosecutor make any charge of what he had done? - Not to the best of my knowledge; he never said a word, he came as quietly as a lamb; I brought him down to Bow-street, and there I searched him, and I found a sixpence, a penny, two farthings, a knife, an old ragged handkerchief, it had been a neck handkerchief, two leather gloves and a woollen one; the prosecutor knew not of them; the prosecutor had said what kind of a man he was; but I should not have known him except he had been with me; he said, he had been very ill used by a man in a striped coat and green baize apron; he told me this before he saw him; when I saw him at first in the morning his face was red just under his eyes, where the blow had been; he said he had been ill used by a man in a green striped coat and a green baize apron; he said, it would be a charity to serve the warrant for him, for he had not a farthing in the world to bless himself with; but I understood it to be for an assault, and not for a robbery, he said nothing about the robbery till I got to Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you understood the man to say that he had been ill used and assaulted, and you did not understand him to speak of the robbery? - I did not, he gave an account of his being ill used at Sir Sampson Wright's door, about ten o'clock Tuesday morning; I did not understand it to be a robbery the first time, he mentioned it the second time that I went to the house for the prisoner, but I cannot swear he did the first.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when you went to take him the first time you went to take him for an assault? - I did; I never had the warrant in my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went the second time what did you know of it? - I thought it was for the same till I got the warrant out into my hand; the warrant was for a robbery. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. During the whole of the time you was with him had you no talk about a reward? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether this man has been in Court before? - I believe he has.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to know whether the gentleman did not come and take me out of Parker's-lane, the Bleeding heart? - It was in Lewkener's-lane the first public house in the lane that I took him, on the left hand, the sign I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. You went twice into this public house? - I did, it was the first turning in Great Queen-street on the right hand and the public house is the first on the left hand.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Your warrant I see expresses

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was there any body by at this time? - No, my lord; a woman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090088"/>cried for shame don't use the man ill.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you mean to say that you never was here but once? - I never was here in any prosecution of my own; I was in one robbery I stopped about eight years ago; I stopped the robbery then.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you now on your oath undertake to say that you never was here as a witness but once? - But once.</p>

            . On Saturday the fifth of January the prisoner came into my shop and asked to look at a black silk cloak; I took one out of the window and gave it her; she observed the shop was too dark to look at it, she would take it to the door; I did not take particular notice of her for the space of a minute till I was alarmed by some people in the shop that the woman had run away with the cloak; there was five or six in the shop at the time; I immediately ran round the counter to the door, and a young woman who was in the shop ran round with me; I observed she was four or five doors from my house, when she found she was pursued she turned into a pastry cook's shop; I followed her into the pastry cook's shop, and I found the cloak on her; she was walking when I first saw her, the cloak was tucked underneath two other cloaks which she had on; I charged her with stealing the cloak; she talked something, but I did not hear what; I opened her cloak and there I found it; this was after I had done charging her with it. I know it was my cloak by the paper that was on it of my own writing 1 l. 5 s. I can swear to it; I did not observe her to go out of the house.</p>

I went to the door and I saw that the young woman did not stand at the door, and I went to the pastry cook's, and it rained very hard, and I asked the pastry cook woman whether a young woman had not come in there to buy a bunn; and that is all as I expect mercy of God and you.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole; I found the prisoner with the iron near Chalk house-lane Inn, in Hampstead-road, he had it in a basket, he flung it across one bar and had it on his shoulder; I took him to Mr. Arn's and left the things and him there; the prisoner never escaped from me; I asked him where he was going; he said, to London; I asked him where he brought it from? he said, from Mr. Brown's at Hampstead, for the iron was not fit to use; he said, he had forgot the name of the street he was going to, it was near St. Giles's; he said he would leave the iron with me and fetch Mr. Brown; I told him I could not let him go; I took him up to Mr. Brown, as he had told me that Mr. Brown had ordered him to take it to London.</p>

               <p>I am a bricklayer; I did not see the prisoner take the lead; he is a slater by trade; I saw him at work on the same day, on the new house that is building belonging to Mr. Hoare, it was the 29th of December last Saturday; I saw the prisoner slating on the same building that day in the afternoon; at night between six and seven o'clock there was an alarm given that one of my men had stole a piece of lead, in consequence of that I ran out, me and several of us, we were in a public house, to the field were the building was in, in consequence of this I ran after the prisoner and another man that was his labourer; I passed this and ran on to the other, and stopped him and brought him back, and met this, and when I stopped him I asked him what he had got there? he had this piece of lead on his head tied up; I believe it cost about 12 s. I have kept that lead ever since; as soon as I stopped him it was taken off his head immediately; I gave him to the watchman. In going by the building some of the people asked him where he got it from? he said, damn you what is that to you, I bought it; with that his other partner said, no, he did not; this man would not reply any more, and I said immediately when I came to open the lead and look, that it was taken from over the shop house belonging to Mr. Hoare in Skinner's-fields, and immediately I went up to the house and felt, and found it was gone; it was dark, and immediately I gave charge of him to the watchman; I missed the lead from behind the chimney of the back gutter; the watchman took him to the watch-house; I brought the lead the next morning, and fitted it on to the place where it was taken from; it was exactly the quantity and the nail holes and all fitted, and the flap fitted, and what is beat up against the wall the flushing fitted; I have no doubt but it came from the place, the whole piece was taken away, it exactly fits the gutter.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. You said that I was at work that day at the building; I never worked at the building in my life.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Did you go and see if the lead was missing? - I went up on the Monday following.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going to my master's to be paid my wages Saturday night; I was going down the London road, and on the road side I saw this lead and picked it up; I said to the young man that was with me, we will take it to the turnpike and see who owns it; I was going down and this gentleman took me and charged the patrole with us.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are you satisfied that that man was on the building? - I am satisfied I saw him on the building; I am sure he is a slater.</p>

               <p>I am clerk to Mr. Ponblank; on Monday last the prisoner at the bar was at work in our warehouse, at about one o'clock on Monday he was at work, between three and four the prisoner at the bar went down twice, stopping rather longer than usual the second time I went down, I found the prisoner was coming up stairs; I took the keys and locked the door in the warehouse, the outer door; I went up again, and the prisoner at about half past four asked me to let him go out into Thames-street to receive a little money. The property was found on the prisoner in Tower-hill the next day; I never saw him no more that evening; I did not see any pimento was missing then; I went to the public house to enquire for the man to come to work; the man that keeps the house said that he was taken on Tower-hill with a bag of pimento on his back.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Last Monday I was at work for this gentleman a little before dinner; I went down to go to dinner and went to the public house; after I had done my dinner I came out a little before four o'clock, I went up to see if Mr. Jackson was come from dinner, he was not; as I was coming down the lane, there was a gentleman standing up in the tail of a cart with the bag; says he, blacky do you want a job; says I, yes, but I have not got my knot; so I carried the bag into the public house till five o'clock; after that Mr. Jackson came from dinner, I went twice down and went backward, but I was not down three minutes any time; then I told him I had a little way to go, and by that time you have finished sewing these bags up, I will be back again, I told him I would be back in half an hour; he unlocked the door for me; when I came to the man, he says, my lad I have been waiting for you these ten minutes; says I, where am I to carry it to; to Stepney-causway, says he; what will you give me, says I; says he, 18 d. and he says, walk on it seems as if it would rain, and if it should, and you come to a grocer's shop in Rosemary-lane, pitch it down and stay there till I come; I went on and meant to pitch it there, and Mr. West came up and asked where I was going with the bag of pimento; I told him, I then stopped a while and did not see the man I had it of; I took the bag up and walked along a little, but did not see him, and did not notice the cornchandler's shop from the grocer's shop; I goes into the cornchandler's shop and throws it down; Mr. West made me take it up again; I thought it very hard to be taken with another man's property, so I thrown it down and made off, and he hallooed stop thief. I here is a good many can give me a character from the water side, but there is none here at present.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. On the whole he bears a very good character; I had a great opinion of him.</p>

On the 13th of December, I think Thursday, I will not be positive, I and my fellow servant, Carter, was going by the side of Fleet-market, he is a patrole the same as I am; I observed the two prisoners at the bar going by me, they were together, they passed us about a step or two; I observed the prisoner at the bar, Kinsman, to have something of a bundle in his hand; I directly turned back to him and said, Kinsman what have you got there? he told me he had got a gown and he was going to take it to his mother's; I asked him where he had brought it from? he told me from a young fellow in the market who was an apprentice in the market; I forgot his name now, and he was going to his mother, and he said afterwards, he was going to the apprentice's wife to to carry a pair of stockings, who lived just by Moorfields; I took him to the Compter directly on suspicion of its being stolen; I found besides in Kinsman's pocket a pair of coat sleeves, two sleeves; after I had taken them to the Compter I went to the mother, and I could not find the mother at home; from thence I went over to Moorfields to the place where he told me he was going to carry the stockings. The next day we had them before the Alderman; I did not advertise them till Saturday; Kinsman said first of all, that he had received them of Delforce; Delforce said nothing at all to that. On Sunday evening, according to advertisement, the prosecutor and prosecutrix came to my house, and brought a piece of the gown, and it matched. I have kept the things till now; they did not see the property till Monday.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am the mother of Brown; for a whole week we were every night with the patroles; we were a week up and down about after the patroles; we met with the patroles at the watch-house every night that we came out; the patroles were nothing concerned in the money, it was left to Mr. Hayman to make it up with what money he could get.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any offer of compromise to the patroles? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where the patroles present when you made it to other people? - They were; but they went away when we went to talk about the money, they said they must not then be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the day the last witness speaks of? - It was the night before last; Mr. and Mrs. Hayman wanted three guineas; I conversed with them both on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they mention the sum or you? - They mentioned the sum, Mr. Hayman and Mrs. Hayman both together, at the time that the three guineas were mentioned; the night before last Mr. Oates was with us, we took him as a witness, there was present myself, the prosecutor, Mr. Hayman, Mrs. Kinsman and another man, I don't know his name, he lodges at the house, he was there every time we met; they went out two or three times this man that received the money and the prosecutor, and came back and said, they would not make it up without three guineas; Hayman went out and his lodger; we told them they must do as they would; we parted that night and we went back again and told them that we had made away with the things off our backs to make the guinea a piece, then the prosecutor said, you must go and make another half guinea; we had only got out at the door before we returned and told him we could make no more; and then he whispered to his wife, and called out to his wife to the door; the prosecutor came back and said, it must be half a guinea more for them, for the patroles would have a guinea, and he must have a guinea and a half, I said it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179301090098"/>does not signify going away, they are fatherless children both of them; so he called his wife out of the room, we were in the room set down again, and they were out the value of ten minutes, and they went out, the prosecutor, his wife, and the man, to consult whether they would take the two guineas or not, then they came in again all three, and the wife set down and the man set down; I says to this gentleman, I hope, says I, you will have mercy, I will pay you the guinea, the same as the other woman, the man said, you must pay me the money, for he must not take the money, for it is felony compounding, or something of that sort, then sir, said I, there is mine, and the other woman got up, and said, there is mine, and we came away.</p>
               <p>Court to Hayman. Did you take any money at all? - I took no money at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you sware that no money was offered to you directly or indirectly? Did you or did you not refuse the money? - I never received any money.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not true what these people have all sworn concerning taking the money? - I never employed any person to take the money for me.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account was this money paid? - I did not consent it should be paid to me, I know nothing of the man being in the passage; I have no such man lodger in my house, I went into the passage with a man, but I did not go into the passage with a lodger.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you and your wife go into the passage or not? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you swear that no man went out of the room with you and your wife. - There were three went out of the room into the passage. The man is not here at present, but he is not a lodger of mine.</p>
               <p>Q Now what did you three go out for? - To consult about business of our own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that after all these people have sworn that you went out of the room and that you had no conversation about the compromise? Will you swear that when you went out with your wife and that man, you did not go out and talk about this business? - No, I don't know that any thing passed about this business.</p>
               <p>Q. The money was mentioned. Do you deny that what these people say is true? - I deny that.</p>
               <p>Q. You still insist on it that the man that received that money did not receive it for making up the felony? - I am sure I don't know what money was left in that man's hands. They offered me money to soften the affair and not to bring the indictment on capitally; for to soften the matter as much as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that money offered to you for that? - They said they would make me any satisfaction I required; I told them I required no satisfaction at all.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the money paid for? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever received it? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the person's name that did receive it? -

               <p>Q. The question I ask you is, whether the same you received of the prisoner you gave to Skillet? - I did, I had no others at all, I know the prisoner, he lived under me some time, No. 12, Castle-street, St. Giles's, he laboured about for different people.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not strike you as an odd thing that he should have boots to sell? - I thought they were given him, and Mr. Skillet told me, they were damaged legs every one; they stunk with some stuff, and were all over mould; I did not ask him any questions about them.

               <p>Q. Could they have gone out without going through your shop? - After dark they cannot, if they had gone out between six and eight I must have seen them; I have no other reasons to believe but they were at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether they were or were not? - I cannot positively say, I did not see either of them go out or come in.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the other persons as near as the prisoner? - Yes, I think they were to the best of my knowledge, but I catched the money in his hand, and I surmized him being a man of a bad character; I did not see his hand in his pocket; the money in his hand was eight shillings and a half crown piece, and three pennyworth of halfpence; I think that is the man to the best of my knowledge; the officers has the money; I stopped the money and took the money from him; I thought it had come from the prosecutor; on account of his being a person of a suspicious character, I laid hold of his hand, he had no knife, nor was any about him on the ground.</p>

On Tuesday before that, there was a gentleman came to take a ride, and he said to my foreman, let me look at my old saddle, I have not seen it a good while, he looks at it and says, I will give you this saddle; so Thursday, after looking two or three hours, my man came to me to my door and knocked, and says, I have not seen that saddle the gentleman gave me, no says I, then if that is the case there must be somebody about the premises that has taken it and the other; we looked over and we found two or three other saddles missing; but before that, I must tell you, that I asked the prisoner on Thursday evening if he knew any thing of this saddle that was missing, he said he knew nothing about it; he was a servant to me, an hostler, had lived with me two or three months, or rather better; then on the evening of Thursday I challenged him very strongly and he denied it, before I went for the constable he denied every thing, and we had him into the saddle room and we challenged him very strictly, we had a long altercation, at last he owned to taking that saddle that the gentleman gave the man, and I asked him where it was, I made him no promise; I asked him what he had gone with it, says he, I have only taken that one, says he, it is underneath the manger at the further end of the nine stalls, well says I, come and let us go and see for it; the constable was present; then we went and he took the saddle out, and after that we took him and had him into the saddle room again; I told him he must naturally know where the others were, and he owned to the others, and told us where he sold them and where to find them; I think he sold three saddles to one Lund, a collar maker in Cow Cross, Windmill-street; and one saddle and bridle since; another saddle and bridle was found at the butcher's, where he had left it, who gave him a joint of meat upon it; Lund has been here but he is not now to be found for these two hours; Lund gave him five shillings for the one bridle and saddle, I suppose it is worth a guinea.</p>

               <p>Last Thursday night two officers of the city at ten o'clock asked me to go along with them, I went along with them to the prisoner where he lodged; after that we came down to Cow Cross and went to Mr. Lund's, and the prisoner said that was the man that bought the saddles of him; we then took him to the compter; afterwards we called at Matloes, a butcher, and asked him if he had a saddle, he said he had; we asked him how he came by it, he said he let him have a shoulder of mutton on it; and then we went to Long-lane and found another saddle, and the gentleman is here present that we took the saddle from; the saddle is not here that we found under the manger, that is left at home.</p>

               <p>Q. Are the nails which you charge the prisoner with receiving, a parcel of those nails stolen by Ashburton? - I presume they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Ashburton has been already tried for stealing the nails from you? - Not these.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that 22,500 nails were found on Ashburton, for which he was convicted, besides those found on the prisoner? - That I positively swear.</p>
               <p>Court. What did you do with the nails the 29th of November 1792? - I knew they were my nails by the writing on the paper, marked by my servant; at various times I missed nails and suspected nails were taken away, but I did not know by whom nor what with.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you have sold these nails with these papers on them? - They were never sold, they were stolen out of my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before this 29th of November had you missed the nails? - I suspected loosing nails at various times; many parcels before that time. The nails are here, upwards of sixty pounds weight; I found them in a corner of the room where the prisoner resided, for when I went up with the officer to search the room, the prisoner was not at home; we went up stairs and saw his wife, she said, he was gone out with the cart and would be at home by two or three o'clock. The prisoner is a dealer in rags.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to Hatton-garden; I was ordered to go along with the prosecutor to get a search warrant, at Guildhall, to search Mr. Cox's house for some nails; I went with it and went up stairs, and found a bag with some nails up in the corner of the room, up one pair of stairs, and I went down stairs and I found a single paper; I found another paper below when Mr. Hattam was not with me, I found them in a cupboard under some old rags; when the prisoner came I took him to Guildhall; we stopped a good while before we came before the magistrate, and there the prisoner said, he would not mind giving a trifle if he could get the business settled.</p>
