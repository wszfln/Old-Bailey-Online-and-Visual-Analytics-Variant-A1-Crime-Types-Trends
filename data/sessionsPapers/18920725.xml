I am a carpenter, living at Morrison's Buildings, Commercial Road—about 12.20 a.m. on 3rd July I came upstairs and put my key into my door, when I was collared round the neck and nearly stifled—I turned and said, "What the—are you doing?" and I caught Williams by the neck with my right hand and threw him down—my brother, who was in my house that night, heard scuffling and came out—I found my watch was taken out, and I made a grab and caught it in McClintock's left hand—he made off through my door, breaking the chain—there was no need for him to be there, because it was private property—my brother ran after him—I kept Williams down in the corner and never let him go till a constable came—my watch was afterwards picked up off the ground; McClintock had taken it out of my pocket while Williams kept me round the neck.</p>

I live at 24, Morrison's Buildings—I am a carpenter and builder, and the last witness's brother—on this night I heard my brother come down the passage and put his key in the door, and instead of the door opening there was a scuffling outside—my sister opened the door and I went out, and my brother shouted, "Stop him, stop him! he has got my watch!"—I dashed after one of the men who had been holding my brother, and who broke away just as I got to the end of the passage—I caught him on the second flight of stairs—I did not lose sight of him for a moment, and when the constable came up I was holding him—I told the constable to go up higher, as my brother was holding another one.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a tailor and outfitter, at 71 and 72, St. Mary Axe—the prisoner has been in my employment for two and a half years as a cutter—I placed implicit reliance in him—his wages were about £5 a week on an average—a coat and waistcoat made for Mr. Austen, a customer, were a misfit, and were returned into stock, and subsequently sold to Mr. Morton, but not suiting Mr. Morton he re<lb/>turned</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189207250022"/>
               <p>them, and that was the last I heard of them—if the prisoner sold any article he should have entered it in the usual way in the measure-book; every order had to be entered in the measure-book—there is no entry in that book of the sale of Austen's misfit to Keats, a billiard-marker—the prisoner keeps that book—I have since seen the clothes at the Police-court and at Keats's house; these are the coat and waistcoat made for Austen—I have tweed in my shop similar to these trousers—when I buy a roll of tweed there is a ticket on it, showing the length of the roll; the roll of tweed like these trousers is five yards short—about two and a half yards go to make a pair of trousers—there was a ticket on the trousers when I saw them at Keats's house—that ticket, to the best of my belief, was in the prisoner's writing, which I know well—he had no authority from me to sell the suit; he has never accounted to me for the money for it—he had authority to sell to my customers, and if he so sold he would enter it in the book—he had no duty to take the money—he had no right to take goods off my premises and sell them to customers who were not mine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I took him into my service on Mr. Stewart's recommendation; he gave him the highest character as an honest man and clever cutter—when I took the prisoner into my employment I knew nothing about tailoring; I am a jeweller by trade—since then the prisoner has been my cutter and foreman, with complete control of the manufacturing department only—we were on terms of intimacy, we had confidence in each other—there were not confidential relations between us—he never lent me money—there was not a running account between us; I had a personal account—if the prisoner wanted any cloth, the goods were booked in the usual way—there were not betting transactions between us continually; nothing of the kind—the prisoner had £2 a week, and half-a-crown for every suit ho cut; I do not call that commission—we had words on, I think, 8th July last; he was rather rude to me before customers—I don't recollect denying at the Police-court that I had a quarrel with the prisoner on the 8th July, and that led to his leaving me—I won't say we had a quarrel, we had words—I did not on his saying he would leave me pay him £14 16s. 6d., made up of £4 16s. 6d. for wages and commission, and £10 he had lent me—I think I paid him £4 16s. 6d. for wages on that day; you are completely wrong as to the £10—there were other people at the end of the same room, which is a large one—the prisoner was not in a position to cut any of my cloths without making an entry of it—he was not allowed to work on his own account; he cut for Taplin and Hopcraft, two tailors, with my permission—I amended what I said at the Police-court, "I know he had private customers of his own," by private customers I meant Taplin and Hopcraft—I know Seelig, Richter, and Marks—I never allowed the prisoner to cut my cloth for his own customers'—I said at the Police-court, "The accused has cut from my goods stuff for his own customers by asking my permission," but I amended it—I do not mean by amending it that I said, "I cannot say whether he cut the stuff he used for other people before asking me"—the clerk of the court put that question to me, and my answer was that I meant Hopcraft and Taplin—he might have cut the stuff without asking me, there were many rolls of cloth short—he was not allowed to have private customers—I meant by private customers Taplin and Hopcraft; I allowed him to cut for them on my premises—</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189207250023"/>
               <p>he introduced customers to me, and their names are on my books—in two years he only introduced £64 worth of business—he is a man of large experience in the tailoring trade—he has not a large connection, I saw very little of it—Mr. Stewart introduced the prisoner to me—I do not think the prisoner could earn £10 a week—he earned with me at least £5 a week—Mr. Taplin was subpœnaed by my solicitor here to give evidence—I saw him at the Police-court, and spoke to him outside the Court—he said, "I shall tell the truth in this case"—it is absolutely untrue that the coat and vest I charge the prisoner with stealing were offered by me to Taplin for 24s., or that, on Taplin refusing, the prisoner offered a sovereign for them, or that I said, "Very well, you can have it"—there is no foundation for it—Taplin is not a friend of mine—I have no reason to suppose that he is actuated by any hostility to me—if he comes into the box and says anything of what you have put to me it is a mistake on his part—Taplin was not called at the Police-court; I left the matter in my solicitor's hands—it was the prisoner's duty to enter up simply the measure-book—Coutman, my brother-in-law, is in my employment; he assists the prisoner—he does the bookkeeping, but that is a distinct thing from entering orders in the measure-book; the prisoner does that—all orders should be entered by him, but sometimes he is absent, and then whoever is there enters them; so that they are kept by a number of men—Austen's order was entered in the measure-book—when the goods came back from him they were sold to Morton, and there is the entry in the boy's writing—I never said the prisoner kept the books, he put down the measurements he took himself—he had nothing to do with the stock-book—I did not say at the Police-court he should have entered it; I kept the stock-book—I don't recollect saying at the Police-court, "He should have entered any measurements taken by him in the stock-book;" what was meant was the measure-book—he never kept the stock-book, and never made entries in it—the measure and stock books are separate—a customer's measure is put down, and when the prisoner cut the cloth he would write against the order the number of yards he cut—as to the coat, there would be Austen's order in the stock-book originally, and when it was returned it would be booked in the ledger again to Morton—the prisoner did not keep the ledger—the boy booked it to Morton in the order or measure book—when it came back it should not have been booked again in the measure-book if it had been sold—on the Friday I had had a few words with the prisoner—we shut on Saturdays—on the Monday he did not come and say he would not leave me in the lurch, although I had not treated him very well—when he was working in my employment I had him arrested—I did not know he was going to leave at the end of the week; otherwise he would have given me notice on Friday—I say emphatically he never told me he was going to leave me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> If there was no entry in my stock or measure book I should have no means of checking the cloth the prisoner cut—the prisoner was cutter, and did not make up suits—he cut for tailors, and the private customers, such as Hopcraft, Taplin, and Lyons he cut for, were tailors—there is no entry in my book of this suit being sold—if the police had not communicated with me I should never have known the suit had been sold till I took stock at the end of the year—the prisoner knew I took stock at the end of every year—there were two hearings at the</p>

I am a billiard-marker, at billiard-rooms near Loughborough Junction—I have known the prisoner for two months or rather more, as playing billiards at those rooms—one night I remarked that I should like to have a suit of secondhand clothes—the prisoner said, "I have a coat and waistcoat I think that would fit you; it was a misfit; I will send it and see if it would fit you"—about two days afterwards he sent me this coat and vest by Garter Peterson's—there was no ticket or invoice with them—two or three days afterwards I saw him and paid him 10s. on account; altogether I paid him £1 2s. 6d. for the coat and waistcoat—a little while after I said, "If you have a pair of trousers you have left off and could sell me, that would be decent enough to go away from home in, I would be very, glad to have them"—he said, "I will see what I can do for you," and he took my measure with a tape from his pocket—some time afterwards I received these trousers, with the ticket still on them, I think—I put the trousers in a drawer at home—I paid the prisoner 9s. 6d. for them—I did not know he was a tailor, but when I had the trousers I thought he must be in that line—I did not know hit name at that time; I knew he was known at the tobacco-shop in front of the billiard-room.</p>

I speak English—I am a baker, carrying on business at 9, Haggerston Road, Dalston—for about three weeks prior to the 20th of June last the prisoner lodged with me; he was an acquaintance—I had a cash-box containing about £9 in money and some papers—he had ceased to sleep in the house a week before that—on Sunday, the 19th, he came to visit me, and about half an hour after he had gone I missed the cash-box and its contents—I immediately communicated with the police, and next day I went with Sergeant Joyce to 81, Charing Cross Road, to look for the prisoner—there are rooms over the shop called 176, Sandringham Buildings—the prisoner was not there—after waiting some time Sergeant Joyce and Mr. Ruman, the manager of the shop, went out to look for him, and they returned shortly with him—I told him I should charge him with stealing my cash-box the night previous; I spoke to him in German—he said, "I have not got it"—someone suggested that we should go up to his room; we did so—it was locked—Ruman fetched the key and we went in—there were two bedrooms adjoining each other—the sergeant asked Ruman if he had lost anything—Ruman pulled out the drawers, looked all over, and said, "No, I. don't think I miss anything else besides the watch and chain"—Joyce said to the prisoner, "Have you got these things?"—he said he had not got them—Joyce then felt his chest, and said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Nothing"—we then told him that Joyce was a detective; he would not believe it—Joyce then pulled out his card and showed it to him; he looked at it as if he was reading it—I don't think he could read English—Ruman then explained to him that he was a detective—the prisoner said he wanted to go into another room—Joyce would not let him—he said, "No, that won't do," and then asked him where he had got his other things, his box—we all went into the kitchen together; there was</p>

               <p>a little portmanteau and two coats lying on the top of it—Joyce asked him for the key of the box—he did not give it him—Joyce took a key I from the pocket of his coat, and took out a pocket-book, in which I recognised some of the papers which had been in my pocket-book, and Joyce handed them to me—I said to the prisoner in German, "These are the papers out of my pocket-book"—he did not say anything; he stood with his back towards the copper in the corner of the room, pulled something out of his pocket and dropped it into the copper; I heard the noise of something falling into the water in the copper—Ruman said, "Hallo, there is something fallen into the copper!" and he went to the copper and pulled out the watch and chain and the bag of money, it was a long purse—I recognised the purse, I had seen it before in my place, it was the prisoner's—Ruman said, "That is my watch and chain"—Joyce pulled the prisoner away from the copper, and I saw him put a handcuff on one of his hands; I don't know which hand it was, but I think it was the left—as soon as I saw that I saw him up with his hand under his smock with a revolver and point it at the sergeant—I saw the revolver in his hand—the sergeant was standing sideways to him and holding his hand, and I heard some shots directly—I was by the side of the sergeant when the first shot was fired—I can't say where Human was then—as soon as I heard some shots I turned round and put the papers on the mantelpiece, and when I turned round I felt a shot—I had heard three or four shots going right off; it must have been the third or fourth shot that struck me—when I turned round I saw the sergeant on the floor, and the prisoner too, and I knelt on his legs to hold him down—Joyce called out, "He has shot me and got loose"; then I heard another shot go off while I was lying on him—Joyce called out, "Take the revolver"—I tried to get it; but we could not; I crawled almost under the sergeant's legs to get at it, he held it very tight, but ultimately I got it from him; I had to use my two hands—as soon as I had got it I heard Ruman run downstairs—the prisoner called out, "I am going to die, I am going to die," several times while he was on the floor; the sergeant was still on him, holding him down—I called out, "I have got it," and I and the sergeant dragged him out into the passage; the sergeant was bleeding, but I did not know where he was snot—as soon as we got the prisoner into the passage he called out again, "I am going to die"—I had hold of him on one side and Joyce on the other; I held him tight—he said, "Let me go"—I said, "No"—then Sergeant Bowden came, and Joyce dropped—when Ruman came back he was bleeding at the back of the neck.</p>

               <p>was standing quite still—my deposition was read over to me, and I signed it—I think I did say so; the whole thing took a very short time—I was shot in the left arm, I did not find it out till I got into the passage; when I first saw Ruman it was in the street; Joyce then had his hand on the prisoner's shoulders; the prisoner was not struggling then—when they came into the house Joyce was holding the prisoner by his arm, so that he should not get away—when they got into the kitchen Joyce did not begin to handle him—the prisoner said, "You must not do that here; let me change my clothes, and I will go to the Police-station"—Joyce caught hold of him and pulled the book out of his coat pocket and dropped it on the floor—I said before the Magistrate, "He red from underneath Joyce as he was leaning on him."</p>

I speak English a little; I can understand you—I am a provision dealer, at 81, Charing Cross Road, and occupy rooms at 176, Sandringham Buildings—the prisoner came into my service on Monday, 13th June—part of the time up to 20th he occupied a bedroom next to mine—before the 20th I had given him the key of my room to get something for me—on Monday morning, the 20th, Sergeant Joyce and Selzer came to my shop—the prisoner was out—in consequence of what Joyce said to me I went up to my room and missed a gold watch and silver chain from a chest of drawers; I also had a revolver there—I did not miss that—I had no cartridges for it since 1887; it was not kept loaded, and had never been loaded since '87—having missed my watch and chain, I went with Joyce towards the City to look for the prisoner—we met him in Charing Cross Road, and we all three went together to my shop—the prisoner then asked what was the matter—Joyce said to Selzer, "Tell him what you have missed"—Selzer said he had missed last night £9, and asked him if he had got it—the sergeant said to me, "Tell him what you have missed," and I told him I missed from upstairs a gold watch and silver chain, and asked him if he had got it—he said he had not got it—he said in German, "Do you think I have done that as well?"—we then all four went up to my rooms and into my bedroom, where I showed the prisoner the drawer from which the watch and chain had been taken—Joyce felt the prisoner's breast, and said, "What have you got there?"—he said, "Nothing"—he had a blouse on, as he has now—Joyce asked him what he had got there—he said, "You won't do it here; you will have to bring me to the Police-station"—I told the prisoner Joyce was a detective, and Joyce took a book out of his pocket and found a card, and the prisoner was looking at it—Joyce asked him where his clothes were—we then went into the kitchen, and there was a portmanteau with two coats lying on it—out of one of those coats Joyce took a pocket-book, which Selzer recognised, and some papers—the prisoner was standing with his back to the copper in the corner; I heard something fall in the water—I looked in the copper and pulled out the watch and chain, and after that a purse with the money—I said, "Here it is"—I heard the prisoner say, "Humph," and looking round I saw Joyce making a handcuff round one of his hands,</p>

               <p>I can't say which hand; the prisoner had his other hand under his blouse; I think it was his left hand; it was not the same hand that Joyce was putting the handcuff on—I saw he had got the hand under his blouse, and the next minute I saw that he fired at Joyce—I saw his hand out like that (<hi rend="italic">straight out</hi>), shooting at Joyce—Joyce was standing up at the time the first shot was fired, he was in front of the prisoner—when the shot was fired he said, "I am shot; fetch the police," at the same moment I was catching at the revolver, and heard more shots; he shot at different times—I saw him when Joyce knocked him down, pulled him down, not by a blow—lie catched his breast, and put him down, forced him down on the ground—it was at the same time I was trying to get the revolver from the prisoner—I did not get hold of it at any time—altogether I heard four or five shots; I can't say how many; I felt myself shot—the prisoner was standing like that, with' his hand down to the bottom—he had the revolver in his right hand, so, we could not touch it—I went to the right side to try and catch it, and I went to the left, and I fell on my knee and down to the floor, and then I felt the shot; I think it was the last shot that hit me—while I was on the floor I heard the prisoner say, "I will die"; and he groaned—I said two or three times, "Have you got the revolver?"—Selzer, or somebody, said, "Yes"; then I went to the balcony and cried "Police!"—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my revolver—Sergeant Bowden afterwards showed me some cartridges; I know nothing about them; they were never in my room.</p>
               <p>

M. Prison, Holloway. 21—6—92.—Dear Cousin Lena,—Fear and trembling will come over you; for if I had been in Germany I never could have become what I have become in London—namely, a criminal. Oh, Heaven!" What have I done to become so quickly a thief and a murderer? But it is all an aberration of mind that has visited me suddenly. I am not always clear in my mind, and that was the case on Monday evening last, when I wrote a letter to you, in which you will observe my absence of mind. After not being the whole of the afternoon at Selzer's, I took away in the evening a cash-box and £9, and several things belonging to Mr. Human, my master. I did no longer lodge where I did lodge the first few days, because some of my money had been stolen there. I then lodged at the business premises upstairs, next to my master's room. Well, Monday morning came, and I had something to do in town. When I returned at two in the afternoon, Mr. Selzer and a detective were present there to arrest me. I went upstairs with them, to the sitting-room, at 81, Charing Cross Road, a German sausage and provision shop. When we were upstairs Mr. Human also came there. They searched about, and found everything I had stolen. I do not know where my things are at the present moment. I had 33s. in money, and some German money, and when the detective was going to secure my hands and take my revolver, I fired on him. he is very severely injured, and they say possibly, going to die. Selzer has been wounded on the arm, and Human on the head. yet I could not liberate myself; I was taken to prison. Oh, dearest angel, pardon me! Most certainly I shall have to die. Oh, Lena, dear, go to the Queen of England! Tell her your grief—tell her of my mental disease, and beg for mercy. Also go to the German Consul. Oh, cannot you help me once more? Write to me at once, so that I shall know whether you have received these lines.—I am, yours, J. G. <hi rend="smallCaps">WENZEL</hi>. Come and see me next Sunday; perhaps we may be allowed to speak together. If I had my liberty I would return to my home. On Tuesday, 28th June, I shall have to appear before the Magistrate."</p>

I live at 43, Buxton Street—the last witness is my daughter—she brought me a coat on the 6th of July, and gave me this ticket—Mr. Taplin came to my shop the next morning, and brought me a coat to baste up in a hurry—I showed him the coat I had from Laws—in consequence of what he told me I showed him that ticket—he said something to me—I then made the coat and took it to Taplin's place—I showed the coat to Mr. Franklin—I showed him that it was his material, because it had the wrong ticket on—the pattern produced is the same material—I gave Mr. Franklin a bit of the cloth—I then took the coat to Laws at Taplin's place.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Inspector</hi>). I went with Mr. Franklin to 73, St. Mary Axe, after calling at 135, Clifton Street, Finsbury—I saw the prisoner, and said to him, "It has come to Mr. Franklin's knowledge that you have been sending out lengths of cloth to be cut into trousers"—I then pointed to these hollowings, and said, "These hollowings have been brought from Richter's place"—he said, "I have given Richter lengths of cloths to cut into trousers, and it is usual for them to keep the hollowings"—I said, "Have you any authority to give them away"—he said, "No, but I think Mr. Franklin knew of it"—this is the piece of cloth I showed him—I made inquiries about a coat, and this piece of lining was produced—I said, "Marks has made a coat for you last Saturday"—he said, "Yes, the lining was Franklin's, but the cloth was not"—that roll of cloth was then produced and measured in the presence of the prisoner—Franklin said it was about two yards short, and the prisoner then said, "I cut the cloth off that piece for the coat"—he was then told that he would be charged by Franklin, and he asked Franklin not to charge him, he would pay for it—he then referred to a book at the other end of the room to find the entry, but failed to do so—I asked what he had done with the coat—he said it was at home—I gave him to understand I should go to his place—he then said he had given it away; if I would allow him to go with me to Loughborough Junction he would produce the coat—he was then given into custody—on the way to the station he said if Franklin would not charge him he would leave the country.</p>

I am a working tailor, carrying on business at Bayswater—I have been in business where I am now for three years—before that I was in the woollen trade since I was ten—I know the customs of the tailoring trade—when work is given out the cuttings belong to the man who makes the garments—that is the generally recognised custom in the trade—whatever the tailor has over when he is making a pair of trousers belongs to him—we never expect it back in any case—I have known the prisoner and the prosecutor for some time—I am perfectly aware the prisoner had private customers—upon more than one occasion I have paid Marks money on account of Laws for Laws' private work—I was very often at Franklin's—I have been there three or four or five times a week, and sometimes three times on one day—the terms that Franklin was on with Laws were not like master and man at all, but very friendly—I produce my book in which I have entered the payments made to Marks on account of Laws.</p>

I am a practical tailor at 262, Whitechapel Road—I have been all my life in the trade—cuttings and hollowings are always reckoned to belong to the tailor to whom the garments are given out to be made up; you would not get ten hollowings out of one hundred pairs of trousers—cuttings sell for 5d. or 6d. per lb.; it depends on the width—8d. to 10d. would not be a large price if the pieces were large enough for capes—I did say that these cuttings would sell for 3 1/2 d. or 4d. not 8d. or 10d.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> We should send them to a respectable firm and take their price-sometimes one man is both tailor and cutter; a practical tailor should be able to go right through—it would be the duty of a cutter cutting out trousers to give the cuttings and hollowings over to the tailor, to make flies and backs of trousers—I do not suggest there is any custom of the trade which enables the cutter to give away those cuttings and hollowings to anybody; they are the governors property if they are cut on the governor's premises.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Bull Inn, Leatherhead, four miles from Epsom—on the night before Derby Day I was at Waterloo Station, going home, when the prisoner, whom I did not know, came up and asked me for a light—I gave him one, and we got into conversation—I asked him if he would have a drink—we had one—he said, "Are you going far?"—I said I was going to Leatherhead, just beyond Epsom—he said, "Oh! I wanted to go to Epsom; I should very much like to go down there"—I said "If you like to go down, why don't you go down?"—he said, "I have not got the money; I have money to go down, but not the money to get a night's lodging"—I said, "If you have the money for the train I daresay I could find you a night's lodging—he came down by a train later on, because he wanted to go home to get a change of linen—he arrived about a quarter to twelve, and came to my house—we had drinks in the bar parlour, where there is a safe, obvious to anyone sitting there—we sat talking some time, and I told him I had no bed for him, he would have to sit in the armchair, because the house was full; the gentlemen did not come till the last thing—I came over giddy, undressed, and got into bed—I was a little the worse for drink; I don't think he was—when I went to bed the key of the safe was in my trousers pocket—I had last seen it safe at half-past eleven—in the safe were two watches, two chains, two diamond rings, and two diamond pins, a pair of brown boots and £45 in gold, and about 20s. in silver—the value of the whole was about £145—there was only the one key to the safe, and no one could have opened it without the key—my trousers were hinging on the knob of the bedstead—when I went to bed the prisoner</p>

               <p>was sitting on a chair bedstead looking at an album—when I woke up next morning at half-past six the prisoner was gone—my door was open—I searched my trousers pockets, and my keys were gone—I went straight to the bar parlour, examined the safe, and found the things in it gone—the next I heard of the prisoner was when I was at Bow Street—I identified the articles produced by the police.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I had never seen the prisoner before that day—at the Police-court he said he thought he had seen me before, but I contradicted it—I did not go anywhere by train before I went home—I was in liquor in London before I got home, and I had more liquor when the prisoner came, about twelve o'clock—I was slightly the worse for drink; I cannot say I was very much drunk—I daresay I should not. have asked the prisoner to come if I had not been in drink—I did not ask him to come down; he came down on his own account—I told him my address at Waterloo—the robbery was committed on 31st May—I did not give information to the police till some little time afterwards—I did not give it next morning, because I was so bad from the effects of the drug he administered to me and drink—the effects lasted three or four days—I then came to London and made inquiries about the prisoner; he said he had been lodging at a coffee-house in the Charing Cross Road; they said there he had left, and I went to two or three other places and made sundry inquiries, and found out he was a dangerous thief, and I did not trouble to take further proceedings for the present, although he had taken £140 of my property—I did not charge him till 9th July, six weeks after the robbery, until I was persuaded to do so by my brother, and at the same time Walker was in the witness-box charged with stealing a gold watch and chain, which I identified—I knew, when I was about to give information, that the prisoner charged Walker with stealing these things from him—that was not two days after the robbery; it was a short time after—the prisoner then gave information to the police that this property came from me, and the police communicated with me about this charge, with the result that I came as a witness at Walker's trial, and the prisoners changed places—I wrote to the prisoner asking him to give me back the jewellery, and telling him he could keep the money; that was after I had been up to London and knew what the prisoner was, and I did not want him to blackguard and blackmail me afterwards—I did not trouble about the money, but I wanted the jewellery, because it was old family jewellery—the prisoner did not threaten to make a charge against me of acting with him in an indecent manner; he said nothing of the kind to me—I was not frightened.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> No indecency took place between us—he did not occupy my bed that night to my knowledge; I was no sooner in bed than I was asleep—when I woke up he was gone—I made inquiries about him about four days afterwards, I should think.</p>

                  </hi>. I was living during Derby week in the same room with the prisoner, at 4, Turner's Court, St. Martin's Lane—on Derby morning the prisoner came back to the room, took his hat off, and showed bags containing gold and silver, and watches, chains, diamond pins and rings, and a pair of brown boots—this is the jewellery—he said he went home with Mr. Watkinson, and that he gave him whisky and port wine, and got him to sleep, and he went down and searched the bar parlour, and found the things in the bar parlour in a safe—he said he had taken</p>

               <p>the key of the safe out of the gentleman's pocket—he said he came out of the public-house and shut the bar door, and could not get a cab for love or money, and that he came to town—I decided to deprive the prisoner of this property on Derby night; young Arnett assisted me—the room door was left open for the purpose—I and Arnett took the box down into the yard, and burst it open when the prisoner was drunk and asleep in the room—shortly after he gave information, and I was taken into custody and charged before Mr. Vaughan, to whom I made a statement in the prisoner's presence—I first made a statement at the station; the prisoner was not there then—I was remanded, and when the prosecutor came up I went out of the dock into the witness-box, and the prisoner went out of the witness-box into the dock—I had no communication with the prosecutor, or anybody except the prisoner, before I made this statement at the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am now living at Battersea—up to June last I was living at 8, St. Matthew Street, with my mother and the prisoner, who is my stepfather, and his children—my mother had a little baby that she was taking care of for somebody—the prisoner has been married to my mother seven years—he was a night watchman when he could get employment—mother used to keep a mangle—on Whit-Monday, 6th June, mother and the prisoner were <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi> all day; he was drunk all day on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in that week—he used to get drunk new and again—on the Tuesday and Wednesday I heard him say to my mother that he would do for her before the week ended—I occupied the back room with my sister and brother—I did not sleep at home on Whit Monday, because he would not let us in—my mother did not sleep there on the Tuesday night—she slept with a neighbour, in the house—father was alone in his room that night, and the same on the Wednesday night, mother slept upstairs—father was <hi rend="italic">rowing</hi>, and calling us dreadful names; he broke some plates—he got better after that—he was sober on the Thursday, and he continued sober for the rest of that week—on Sunday, 12th June, he was sober; I saw him that day—I went to bed that night with my sister and brother—my father and mother had gone to bed—I heard nothing between them during the day to attract my attention; he was quite sober when he went to bed—mother was sober—I heard nothing during that night—I was roused up by the police at half-past four in the morning—I then left my room and went upstairs; they would not let me go into the front room—I saw my mother dead at the mortuary on the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 64, Vincent Square—I am the sister of the last witness—on Sunday, 13th June, I was living at St. Matthew Street—the prisoner was drunk that day and quarrelling with his wife; he smashed all the crockery and burnt up the tea, sugar, and butter—he was calling mother names and said he would do for her before the week was out—he sharpened two table knives and put them into his pocket—I saw no more of the knives after that; that was Whit-Monday—that night I slept with my sister in the top room—I heard him say to mother again that night that he would do for her before the week was out—on the Tuesday afternoon he was sitting by the fire, drunk—I slept upstairs with my sister that night, and on Wednesday I slept in Mrs. Cowen's room—on the Wednesday he was jawing and said we were only a lot of bastards—he called his wife names—he then had the two knives in his pocket, hanging out—he was drunk then—on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday he was sober; there was no quarrel then—he was all right on Sunday—I went out that evening at nine-my mother and he were then standing at the door talking quietly—I returned at ten; he was then in bed in the front room with mother and the baby—I slept with my sister next door; the door between us was open—I heard nothing in the night—the first thing I heard was the woman upstairs came and woke us up, and the police came, about five o'clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> On the Sunday I and the prisoner had a row—that was between one and two in the afternoon—he had spoken crossly to me, and then went to his own room—I shouted through the door, "You need not worry; you don't keep me"—I was in the habit of having quarrels with him, and so were my sister and mother—mother was not a bad-tempered woman—she drank occasionally, not so very of ten—I never knew them exchange blows—they quarrelled chiefly about my conduct—I always took my mother's part—he complained of my behaviour—he said he would do for mother during the. week—he often used expressions of that sort during the rows through the whole of their married life—I have heard mother make use of similar expressions to him, not so very often, but sometimes—he is a hasty man, quick in temper, soon come and soon go—during the seven years they lived together he only struck her twice, and on each of those occasions he went to the Police-station and gave himself into custody—it was about three in the afternoon when I saw him sharpening the knives—we dine about two—he sharpened the knives about dinner-time; that was on the Monday.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a registered medical practitioner and acting divisional surgeon—about four in the morning of 13th June I was called to the ground floor of 8, St. Matthew Street—I found the parlours in the occupation of the inspector; he helped me in through the window—I found the deceased in the bed, quite dead, lying on her right side, with the left arm doubled up and the hand under the chin, the right arm stretched out at right angles to the bed; she was lying in a natural position, as if asleep—I found a wound on the left side of the head, above and behind the left ear—it was a contused wound, a star-shaped wound; blood was not coming from it then—there was also a wound behind the ear; that was a lacerated and contused wound, and irregular—the ear had been struck; it was an indirect wound—the left side of the face was bruised and swollen; there was a great deal of blood in the bed, and it had run. through the mattress and on to the floor below; it was oozing from the nose and ears; there was no indication of any struggle; the blood was all in one place in the bed; there was no smearing, nothing to show that the body had been shifted from the time the first blow was struck—I am of opinion that she never moved after the first blow—she was subsequently removed to the mortuary—next day I made a post-mortem; I found the temple bone fractured, corresponding with the wound; it was a comminuted fracture, and extended through the parietal bone, the occipital bone, to the parietal bone on the opposite side—there was a fracture of the base of the skull through a portion of the temporal bone, which was very much shattered—it was such an injury as would be caused by this roller—there had been several blows; it could not all be caused by one blow; there were at least three—the fracture of the skull was the cause of death—the inspector afterwards gave me a pair of trousers, and I found blood on the band.</p>

I went to the Police-court when the prisoner was in custody, and had a conversation with him in the cell—I asked him if it was true what the people said, that his wife had had a miscarriage; he replied, "I told her to change her linen before she went to bed on the Sunday night, and she said, 'No, I have had a miscarriage, but not by you, by a soldier and she told me several things that were not pleasant to hear"—I told him I would not believe it if I was going to have my head chopped off; that was referring to what he Slid about the miscarriage—he said he would not say anything there; he would wait till he got further.</p>

I am a cocoanut showman, of 70, Ernest Street—early on the morning of July 2nd I was in Ernest Street, and saw the prisoner there and the two Grooms—two policemen were standing at the corner of the turning—I went indoors and spoke to my mistress, and went out again and saw the prisoner standing against his own door, and five or six men on the opposite side—I asked him what was the matter—he said there were a lot of men on to him—I said, "Why don't you go in?"—he said, "I cannot get in," and a man struck him in the face and another man kicked him in the privates, and five or six more kicked him—I saw the man who was stabbed in the neck, and I took him in a barrow to the London Hospital—there were a lot of people there, and women screaming "Murder!" and much confusion.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cashier in the banking department of Messrs.

Munro, to whom the order is to be made payable—about one o'clock that day a person, who appeared to be a bank clerk, having a case and chain, came to the office, and produced from the case this banker's payment slip for £2,190, and handed it to me in the ordinary way—I knew what it was because of the letter—it has the signature of Mr. Hibbert, of the London and Westminter Bank, and is filled up to the credit of Meyer—the other</p>

               <p>part of it would go to the Temple Bar branch, be signed by the manager there, and go to the Clearing-house, and we should be credited with that urn, so that we could draw upon it—about five o'clock that day someone representing himself to be Meyer called—J got him to write his name, and compared it with the letter, and thought it was all right; and then, at his request, and as contained in the letter, I gave him this draft on Paris for 55,000 odd francs, and he left—I afterwards, for safety sake, sent to Paris Munro's signature, which had been enclosed in the letter—the following Monday was Bank Holiday—on Wednesday, 20th April, or Thursday, 21st, the same person, representing Mr. Meyer, brought me the Paris draft—I noticed it had been endorsed "F. Munro"—at the request of the person I gave him this cheque on the London and Westminster Bank for £2,187 16s., which was duly honoured and debited to our account—on the day after we received information from our Piccadilly branch of the other document of a similar character, and also from Meyer, for £2,000; inquiries were made and the fraud discovered—we communicated with the Capital and Counties Bank, and the matter was put into their solicitors' hands.</p>

Munro—the writing of the body of this £2,190 one resembles that of the prisoner's in some respects—formerly we used bankers' slip forma of a slightly different shape; those old ones became of no use; these are some of them—any clerk would bring me documents to sign from time, to time.</p>

Brown at my request—I put the numbers of a portion of the postal-orders on the note in blue pencil—it is not a common transaction to change a £50 note for so many orders; but it would not be surprising for large orders—about seven or eight days afterwards my attention was called to the transaction by a police officer—he took me to Bury Street, I believe, Oxford Street—I there saw several persons in the Street; the prisoner was there; I recognised him—he very much resembles the person I accepted the note from, but I will not swear to him—I do not identify him—he resembles him in every way.</p>

Street, short for Bed ford Street—I told him that was irregular, and asked him to fill in Bedford Street in full—he went to the desk to do so, and I looked at the Directory and found there was a Mr. Lamb at 157, Blackfriars Road—I then paid him £8 15s., and he said he would give me 5s. to make up £9—I explained to him the rule in regard to postal-orders, and why the trouble and delay should have been given him—after he left the office I put on the back of the £1 order a full description of the person presenting himself—he was with me quite thirty minutes while this was going on—I afterwards met the prisoner face to face in a street coming down from the British Museum, and recognised him immediately.</p>

On 22nd June I was at the Capital and Counties Bank, Ludgate Hill—I saw Mr. Rogers and others there—the prisoner was called into the manager's room—he was told in my presence that Mr. Rogers had identified him as having passed £8 15s. postal-orders at Bedford Street, Strand—he said, "I know nothing about it"—he was asked if he had any explanation to give from whom he had received them—he said he knew nothing about it—he was afterwards taken to the Central Post Office, Holborn—five or six of us were in the room—I was informed he had been identified before in the street—he was given into custody—I told him he would be charged with forging and uttering a banker's pay-slip for £2,190—he said, "I don't understand"—I said, "Do you understand what I say to you?"—he said, "Yes, perfectly"—I said, "You have been identified by four persons in the street as having changed a £50 and £100 note, and also by Mr. Rogers at the Bedford Street post-office"—I took him to the station; he was charged; he made no reply—next day I got a search warrant, and went to 18, Little Russell Street, Bloomsbury, where he lodges—I found in the room which I was shown as his these pieces of credit slips.</p>

I know he used to shave, having seen his shaving things. About a week ago last Monday I met Mr. Kent at the door, and spoke to him; I noticed that he had a little hair on his upper lip, nothing that could be called a moustache; it looked as if he had omitted to shave for a day or so. This was after he had been ill; with that exception I have not noticed particularly whether he had any hair on his upper lip; I could not swear whether he had or had not. If he had any hair on the upper lip it must have been very little, nothing that you could call a moustache, or I must have noticed it."</p>

I am proprietor of the Guildford Arms, Guildford Street, St. Pancras—on Saturday night, 23rd April, I locked up my house safely—when I came down next morning I found the bar parlour in die order; all the locked drawers had been forced open, and the contents were strewn about—I missed about 45s. in coppers, keys, a cheque-book, on the London and County Bank, and a few other little things—in the cheque book were about ninety Drank forms, and one filled in—these are five of those cheque forms, they were blank—I know nothing about the writing or the signatures on any of them, or who filled them in—I know nothing about any of the prisoners.</p>

The house was shut about twelve—I heard no noise in the night—my servant came down about eight next morning—she saw nothing; she did not go behind the bar—I examined the premises with the police—I saw no indication of anything wrong except in that room—the bar that goes across the door inside had been removed, and was lying against the wall close by—I don't know that the door had been opened.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a timber dealer, of 53, Richardson Street, Long Lane, Bermondsey—I have known Price eight or nine years—I went with him to Sergeant's office about a reference, and when I came downstairs he said he had got a party not far off, at a public-house, who wanted a cheque changed; could I get it done—I told him I could not get it done myself, as I had not been in the habit; my wife had always got the cheques done; I would see if I could get it done—afterwards he said he did want some money—I went with him to a public-house near Finsbury Circus, where I saw Home, who was a stranger to me—Price said Home was a friend of his, and he had got a cheque he wanted cashed, and could I get it done—I said I would go and ask my wife if she could cash it—Home asked me to go, and we went over London Bridge by omnibus, and I took the cheque they gave me to my wife—it was drawn by Weeks, in Home's favour, for £15 10s. on a bank in Oxford Street—I came back to the prisoners, who were standing in the Borough; and told them my wife would have nothing to do with it, as it was a strange cheque; and I gave it to Price, who gave it to Home—Home said Weeks was a haberdasher in Holborn—I said my wife would have nothing to do with it, as it was not made payable to me, and was not a trading cheque—afterwards he asked if I could get a smaller cheque done, as he had got</p>

               <p>some goods to clear, and ho was away from home—I said, "I don't know whether she will or not"—he asked me to come over into the City with him, and he would see if he could get another—I went with him to Leadenhall Market—he was absent about a quarter of an hour, and came back with Gear—he asked me my name, as he could get another cheque if I would do it—I gave him my name—he was away for about ten minutes, and he came back with Gear, and they went away a little distance by themselves, leaving me with Price—they came back and said I was to come with them—we went as far as the Monument, and then they left me and Price and went about one hundred yards off, and looked as if they were going to draw this cheque up—then they came and asked me to go with them, and I went over London Bridge to my wife with this cheque which Home gave me, to ask if she would cash it—she would not have anything to do with it, and I came back and gave it to Home, and told him my wife would not have anything to do with it, as she did not know Weeks. (<hi rend="italic">This cheque was drawn by Charles Weeks for</hi> £5 17s. 6d. <hi rend="italic">on the London and County Bank, Oxford Street, in favour of Poet</hi>)—Home seemed very much put out, and asked me if Price could go, and I said no, Mr. Fogden did not know me, as my-wife had always got it done—on Saturday, 17th June, Price came to my house with a cheque about nine a.m., and told my wife it would be all right—Home said he was a haberdasher—he wanted this money to clear some goods—my wife said, "I don't know whether Mr. Fogden is come to town, but I will see. Sometimes I have had it done by the foreman, but I have not always had the money; he has given me part till Mr. Fogden is down"—Price went away, and when he came back my wife said, "You can have £3, and the rest when the cheque is passed through the bank," and she gave Price £3—I saw Home after that with Price, who gave Home 35s., I believe, out of the £3—I saw them about twelve or after that, and I did not see thorn again till I saw Home at the Police-station about a fortnight afterwards—I was not at home when Mr. Fogden afterwards called—I saw the cheque at the Police-court—I never saw Price, Home, or Gear after they got the £3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by Price.</hi> I did not see you after the Saturday—I don't know how much the parcel of timber you sold me comes to, I cannot get to measure it; it is buried now with other timber, and cannot be got at—I believe by the way you kept back with me that you did not know the cheque was stolen when you handed it to me—if I had had the least idea it was stolen I should not have attempted to cash it—my wife afterwards got the balance of £2 17s. 6d.; she has paid part of it back—this letter is in Sergeant's writing I believe.</p>

Price introduced Home to me—I had bought timber through Price, not from him—I was not anxious to pay Price—Sergeant had timber for sale—none of it has been paid for—I and Price were not desirous of raising money to pay for timber—Home mentioned something about a promissory note if I would get this cheque cashed—sometimes I want money to convert timber and get it into the market, and at this time I was a little short of money, and was anxious to get some—Home said before the cheque was cashed that if I would get the cheque done he could get me money out of a gentleman who had got plenty—Home wanted money to clear goods—the cheque for £15 10s.</p>

               <p>had nothing to do with raising money for me—Price asked me to cash the cheque for Home, whom I had never seen before—I first saw Gear when I gave the first cheque up to Home, and he went to Leadenhall Market—£3 was paid to Price on the cheque, and I heard he gave 35s. to Home—it was not paid to get a bill discounted for me, but to get goods.</p>

On Sunday, 19th June, about 6.30, I went to 15, Stafford Road, Kilburn—I saw, on the second floor, Westoby and Mrs. Forman having tea—I said, "Westoby, I am going to take you into custody; you answer the description of a man wanted for burglary"—he said, "Burglary!"—I said, "Yes; being concerned with a man named Forman"—he said, "I don't know him"—I said, <hi rend="italic">"Alias</hi> Ford"—he said, "Oh, yes; this woman's husband"—I said, "Yes"—he said, "Anything else?"—I said, "No, not that I am aware of"—on coming down the staircase Westoby was behind me—he was taking something out of his pocket, and I turned and said, "Don't do that; put that back in your pocket"—I seized him by the arm and kept him like that all the way to the station—I found that what he was taking out were three cheques; one on the Charing Gross Bank has nothing to do with this matter—at the station I took the cheques out of his pocket and handed them to the inspector; the prisoner ran across the charge-room and said, "Those are mine"—the inspector said, "Wait a moment"—the cheques were open, not in an envelope.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant E</hi>). On 19th June, about eleven, I arrested Westoby, who was detained at Kilburn Station—these two blank cheques were produced to me, and I said to Westoby, "What account can you give of these two cheques, as they form part proceeds of a burglary?"—he said, "I shall say nothing"—I told him he would be charged with Forman, already in custody, with being; concerned in breaking out of the Guildford Arms on 24th April, and stealing, among other articles, a cheque-book containing ninety blank cheques, of which these formed part proceeds—he did not say anything—after he was committed for trial he made this statement in my presence—Inspector Marshall took it down, and I saw the prisoner sign it: Cecil</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189207250068"/>
               <p>Westoby: I am now awaiting trial for burglary and receiving, with four other men, and desire to say that my part in the matter was entirely brought about by the man Forman entrusting me to take charge of eight cheques, similar to these put in evidence, on the London and County Bank; stating that he had two banking accounts, one on the London and South-Western, which his wife was aware of, and the other, meaning the London and County, which he did not want his wife to know of, and if he carried them in his pocket she would find out; so I took them, and as he wanted, so he had them from me. I was never indebted to him, he being indebted to me for selling his interest in property at Cricklewood to a Mr. Willett, of Kilburn; as also for rent due from rooms occupied by me at 98, Cambridge Road With respect to the £10 cheque uttered to the ironmongers in Thames Street, Forman owed that firm money, and asked me for one of the cheques; it was then blank. On the following day I saw the same cheque in his possession filled in, and he then endorsed it in my presence at the Gray's Inn Tavern. With regard to the £3 10s. cheque, I never met him as stated, nor do I know anything of it, nor have I ever received one farthing in respect of same. Forman had five blank cheques from me out of the eight above-mentioned. I sold one of the cheques to Gear for 2s., and the other two were found on me. I don't know where Forman got the cheques from; he got me to take one of the cheques to a paperhanging warehouse in the King's Road, where he owed an account, but the governor was not in, and the shopman would not cash it, and I gave it back to Forman; it was about 90 or 99, King's Road, on the left from Westminster to Hammersmith, nearly opposite a square. I know nothing of the burglary nor the other cheques"—I was with Bannell when he took Price—at the station Price said he obtained the £5 17s. 6d. cheque from a man, and gave a description, owing to which I brought a man to Hunter Street Station—the description was of a man about 40 to 45, about 5 ft. 9 in., clean-shaven over the chin, with whiskers and moustache turning grey, who frequented Holborn, Gray's Inn Tavern, and also Leadenhall Market—Price said that the man I brought there was not the man—on 26th I was with Bannell, and saw Home in Elderfield Road, Clapton, about 1.15 p.m.—I said I was a police officer, and should take him into custody for being concerned with three other, men in committing burglary and uttering a cheque on the London and County Bank for £5 17s. 6d., which he had given to two men named Price and Poet, and which formed part proceeds of a burglary—at first he said he did not know the men, but on the way he said he knew a man named Price, and had introduced a man named Poet to him—he commenced to make a statement—I cautioned him—at the station I took down from him this statement, which he signed: "On Friday, 10th inst., I met a man I knew by the name of Price, in Kingsland Road, Hoxton. He said he had an appointment with a man named Poet, at Finsbury Pavement, and asked me to go with him to meet Poet. I went with him to 99, Moorgate Street, a public-house; he there met Poet. Price asked me to wait inside the house while they went to see Sergeant, a timber merchant. They returned in about ten minutes, and said they were unable to see Sergeant, but they had seen the clerk. Price then produced some letters, and said the references were satisfactory. Poet said he was rather short of cash, and I asked him if he would have a drink, which he did. Price</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189207250069"/>
               <p>turned and said to me, 'This is an old friend of mine, he is a timber merchant; we have done hundreds together.' Price said, 'Can you raise me a little cash?' I said, 'In what way?' He said, 'Either by bill or promissory note.' I wrote to a gentleman I know, and gave him an appointment at Liverpool Street Railway Station; the appointment was not kept. He said, 'Can you raise me some cash to-day?' I said I would go to a gentleman named Gear, and they might oblige you with a post-dated cheque till Monday. Poet said, 'Don't get it post-dated, make it Dayable to me; I will then, if you will come with me and Mr. Price, take it to my wife, and get her to get it cashed at the grocer's. We then went to Leadenhall Market, where we met Gear, and explained to him that Poet was a timber merchant and wanted temporary assistance. Gear said, 'I will do it for a consideration'; that was that Poet would get the cheque cashed and give me an amount out of it, which I believe was £1, and Price was to receive £1 5s. Gear went away and returned with a cheque on the London and County Bank, Oxford Street, for £5 17s. 6d., which he handed to Price, and Price to Poet, and Price borrowed a half-crown from me and gave it to Gear. Poet said, 'Come with me and Price over to my house,' and I went with them; I waited in a public-house with Price near London Bridge. Poet left us for about an hour and a half; returned and stated that he was very sorry, but he could not induce his wife to change the cheque; would we allow it to stand over till the morning, which we did. I went home. I met Price next morning at Broad Street Station by appointment; we then went to the public-house where we had been the day previous, and he left me to go to Poet's house; Price took the cheque with him, he having had possession of it all night; he was gone about an hour; when he came back he was with Poet. Price said, 'Me and Poet have induced his wife to get the cheque cashed at the grocer's, but I have only received £3 on account; I have left £2 17s. 6d. owing on the cheque for Poet's wife to receive at twelve o'clock. Poet said, 'I am going to hold it to see if the cheque it all right. 'Price had the £3 in his hand; he gave Poet £110s. and me 10s. We then separated, and I have not seen Poet since. I have seen Price; he came to my house on 22nd at 10.30, and said a detective had been to see him with reference to the cheque, as it was the part proceeds of a burglary. I said I would go to Leadenhall Market and ask Gear for an explanation. He said, 'Don't do that; I have got to meet the detective at two o'clock. He left me to go there, and I have not seen him since. I know nothing about a cheque for £15. "Home made this subsequent statement, which I saw him sign, after it had been read over to him: "I desire to state that the man Forman now on bail had an account at the Peckham and Clapham Branch of the London and South-Western. Bank, where you may be able to obtain information with regard to other matters than those with which he is charged. With regard to the cheques stolen from the Guildford Arms public-house, Guildford Street, I wish to state that Forman went to Walk's and Co., drapers, Holborn Circus, and bought a length of black dress silk, and in payment tendered one of the cheques, but I cannot say if it was cashed; it would be about six weeks ago. About the same date he went to Lewis, silk merchant, in Holborn, and did likewise; to Peter Robinson's about the same time, and did the same; cannot say whether it was the Oxford or Regent Street branch. He bought a white felt hat at Heath's in Holborn, and may have given</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189207250072"/>
               <p>a cheque. He also purchased a brown topcoat for about £6, of the West-end or West London Clothing Company, and had a row over one of the cheques."

Machattie to James Carrol—the freight for all the three lots was paid at the same time; it was one shipment—two grooms had passages given. them in the vessel.</p>

I was due to him—I have not yet been paid the £55; I told Mc Math that; it was true—I did not "give Machattie a receipt for £150 as the price of the horse, because he asked me to do so—I did not say I did—I did not read over the statement when I signed it; it was not read over to me—I never gave Machattie a receipt, and he never asked me to do so—I swear I never said I did—Machattie did not say anything about insuring the horse at the time he bought it—he told me to get an insurance on the horse—"at the time that Machattie bought the horse he bargained with me that I was to insure the horse in my own name for £250," that is true, he told me I could—I have not received any money up to now; I bought the horse for myself—"I bought the horse for Machattie for £150; I paid the money to Crawford, and got a receipt for the money, which I think I gave to John Machattie"—I gave it to Machattie to send along with the horses to show the price they were bought at on this side, I understood—I did not give Machattie a receipt for £150 as the price of the horse because he asked me to do so—the receipt I got from Crawford I gave to Machattie to send with the horses to snow the price—I did not get the money from Crawford—I have not been paid anything yet—I insured both horses for £390—Machattie showed me the letter from Joseph Carrol in America—I know Carrol—they were consigned to Montreal—I employed a person to look after them—I heard about the end of October by this telegram that the horses had died on the 24th October from the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Warwick</hi>—the telegram was addressed to the care of Machattie—I instructed Graham to pay the insurance money to Machattie—both horses did not really belong to Machattie—it had not been arranged that in the event of the death of any of them he was to get the insurance-money; I never said that—I did not read the statement before I signed it—I did not get the insurance</p>

I am the master of the <hi rend="italic">Pretoria</hi>—I sailed in her from Southampton on 6th February last—I had some communication with the owners as to the horses on board, and when Catto came on board I asked him what previous experience he had of the charge of horses at sea—he said he had been to America with horses—I asked him if he had been to the Cape before; he said no—I spoke to him every</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARKER</hi>. Catto did not consult me when the first horse was ill—I do not profess to know how to treat sick horses—he said he had given it sweet spirits of nitre, because, he thought it was suffering from inflammation—the horses were not carried half-way between the bow and the stern; they were more forward than that, and in a part which passengers had access to—there was not a good deal-of complaint among the passengers about the horses occupying space which they should have had—there were about forty passengers; I do not know that their feeling was in favour of Catto; one of them told me he did not know whether I had any right to interfere with Catto—I did not find among Catto's effects a statement signed by some of the passengers—I think there was a passenger named Harvey Holmes on board—I held a sort of inquiry—Catto was present at the greater part of the post-mortem; he went away for five minutes; and came back again—Catto said that he had been to America three or four times.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I am quite clear that he said he had never been to the Cape before—I have seen three or four hundred horses at sea from time to time; they never suffer from bad weather unless you have a fortnight or three weeks of it, but we only had forty-eight hours' bad weather—there was nothing to account for this sort of illness.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Sergeant</hi>). I was present on June 9, 1892, when Dr. Sylvester was examined at the Mansion House—the defendants were present, and had the opportunity of cross-examining him. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of Dr. Harold Augustus Sylvester was here read, as follows:</hi> "I am a M. R. C. S. England, of Tunbridge, Kent. I am surgeon on the ss. <hi rend="italic">Pretoria.</hi> I sailed in her in February last. There was a consignment of five horses on board. On 5th March all were in good health, as far as I could judge. There had been a gale; they suffered in a measure from it, but I noticed nothing like ill-health amongst them. On the morning of March 5th I noticed one of the horses; it appeared to be very ill. It looked in a very dazed condition. It was perspiring, frothing at the mouth, and it was hanging its head down, and resting it on the front of the box. This was between nine and ten a.m., and I saw it again at eleven a.m.; it was worse then, but was not foaming at the mouth; otherwise the symptoms were the same. Captain Reynolds was with me at eleven o'clock. He made a suggestion to Catto that I should supply him with any medicine he required. He said, 'I don't require any for this particular horse, but should like some quinine for one of the other horses, which has a cold. He gave us to understand that the horse had not passed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189207250089"/>
               <p>any water. Afterwards I asked him if he had any instruments for it or could use them. He said, 'I have not any'; I gave him some quinine for the other horse. In the evening I saw the horse again who had been ill in the morning; it then seemed all right and was feeding. My attention was called to the death early next morning, and I was present at the post-mortem examination. The body of the horse was perfectly healthy, with two slight exceptions; there was a small area of redness in the right lung on the superficial part, and the suspensory ligament of the bladder was stained as if by the rupture of a small vessel. There was also a slight congestion of the superficial vessels of the brain and spinal cord. There was nothing in those to account for death; I could discover no disease in the body to account for this. I do not pretend to understand horses, but if I saw similar conditions in the human being I should be led to the conclusion that death had occurred from poisoning, and not from natural causes, and that the poison had been a non-irritant one. I was present when a portion of the stomach and intestines were taken by Mr. Waddell and placed in a jar and sealed hermetically. I was also present when the prisoner Catto produced a syringe which he said he had used on one of the horses.—<hi rend="smallCaps">HAROLD A. SYLVESTER</hi>."</p>

               <p>from its shape and make in every possible way—his knees were not broken, but he was <hi rend="italic">over</hi> at the knees, and very narrow-ribbed, and constitutionally unsound—I do not think from his appearance that he was one of the fastest trotters who ever came into England—I formed an opinion as to its value—I was present at its sale—I think it fetched £8—I would not have taken it home for anything—I would not have had it as a gift—I think it fetched very much more than its value—the disease pink eye is a form of influenza; I never knew a horse to die of pink eye; I have done nothing but nurse them, and I never knew one die—they might if neglected—red water is a very different disease, a disease of the kidneys and bladder.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ASQUITH</hi>. I examined the horse at Barn's stables—it was constitutionally unsound—I could not gallop the horse for its wind, and could not tell whether its lungs were unsound; it was not fit to gallop; I did not try—it was standing in a stable—I took it out and saw it trot, but it was not fit to gallop; it could not have galloped, it would have tumbled down and broken its neck; I knew better than to try—it was a narrow-ribbed beast that I would not give sixpence for; I did not get on his back, I was not going to risk my own neck—I have seen thousands, scores, hundreds of trotting horses before, horses that ran in trotting races—I have had my experience in Ireland—this is not a photograph of the horse—these look like photographs of trotters; this one has broken knees—the big chestnut that went out with me had knees a great deal worse than these in the photograph—this horse's knees are slightly inclined to stand over,. but the other is straight in the legs—a great number of colonial people were present at the sale, which was on the Parade, by auction—my opinion of the horse was formed from what I saw of it when it stood in the stable yard at Barn's, and when it was sold by auction.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LYNN</hi>. It was a chestnut horse that arrived from the <hi rend="italic">Dane</hi>—I heard Mr. Dickie's evidence, and I heard him say it was worth £60 or £70 for a carriage horse—that surprised me very much—in its young days it might have been fit to ride—I said at the Policecourt, "I think he had never been a good horse; he was always a very inferior beast, and in his very best days was never worth £5"—he might have been worth £5 in his young days—I disagree with Mr. Dickie, and I am sorry to do so with one of my professional mends—I am a veterinary surgeon—strychnine is very often given to horses as medicine under skilled 'hands—one to three grains might be administered without any fear, and that might go on for several days—the average weight of a horse's liver is about twelve pounds, I believe.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARKER</hi>. Pink eye is infectious—there would be greater difficulty in treating it at sea than on land—it would aggravate the danger, and the nursing apparatus would not be so handy as it is at the Royal Veterinary College—symptoms of strychnine and aconite are very similar, and the symptoms you find are very characteristic of either of those poisons—I made a written report of the appearances I observed immediately afterwards, I have the notes in my pocket now—I expressed my opinion that the symptoms pointed to aconite poisoning—I found the bottle with two ounces missing, which was enough to kill half-a-dozen horses or more, and symptoms of aconite and strychnine poisoning are so closely allied that I came to that conclusion—I did not examine its</p>

I am professor of chemistry at Guy's, and scientific analyst to the Home Office—on 29th March last I received by rail a packet from the Union Steamship Company, containing a jar sealed with a Venus and Cupid seal, labelled "Care of Captain Maloney," and sent to Captain Dixon—there was also a bottle secured with a leather label, containing a portion of liver—the first jar was labelled, "Whole contents of stomach of dark brown horse, <hi rend="italic">Dane"</hi>—I have carefully analysed the contents of both those vessels—the first contained the stomach contents, apparently of a horse, a lot of fodder and grain, and it also contained about two grains of strychnine—the second vessel contained about an ounce and a half of liver, with some spirits of wine; it contained one-twentieth of a grain of strychnine—taking a liver at 12lbs., that would be about six grains in the liver alone—I have been in Court, and heard the description of the symptoms of the horses that died on board the <hi rend="italic">Dane</hi>—taking my analysis into consideration, I say the horses died of strychnine—I was away ill for some time—certain packages were handed to me by the last witness as coming from the <hi rend="italic">Pretoria</hi>—I analysed them in the same way—in the stomach contents I found a large quantity of strychnine—I extracted thirteen grains from one-third of the contents; that would be about thirty-nine grains in the whole—I also found two and a third grains in about four</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189207250098"/>
               <p>ounces of the liver—that would work out at something very large in the whole liver if the viscera had been in one vessel—I don't think that quantity had been absorbed during life—in one of the jars was Fleming's tincture of aconite; that is the strongest known—the earlier symptoms described of the horses on the <hi rend="italic">Pretoria</hi> I think were those of strychnine—they might be referable to aconite; I am not positive as to that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LYNN</hi>. I found one-twentieth of a grain of strychnine in the liver of the horse on board the <hi rend="italic">Dane</hi>—in the whole stomach I found two grains—I do not remember whether I stated at the Policecourt that I estimated in the stomach and liver that there were five grains—probably I put that as a minimum—I assumed then that the liver weighed one hundred and fifty ounces, or nine or ten pounds—I said I did not know exactly the weight—I have learnt since that I rather understated it; I have learnt since that it is twelve pounds, that is forty-two ounces more than I estimated—I say now, if the liver weighed twelve pounds, the stomach and liver would contain about eight grains—I have never known eight grains of strychnine to kill a horse—I have had no experience of killing horses; I have not had experience of fatal disease in horses—fifteen grains is the smallest dose recorded—I have never known strychnine given for horses; I am not a <hi rend="italic">vet.</hi>—I have had experience of gentlemen who have had horses, and I have never known it given them, but I have heard it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BARKER</hi>. I tested for aconite in the <hi rend="italic">Pretoria</hi> horse—I did not find any—the later symptoms might be accounted for by strychnine without aconite; I am not sure about the earlier ones—they looked like aconite, but they were not sufficiently definite; they did not look look like strychnine—Fleming's tincture of aconite is much used for human beings.</p>

I am sub-inspector of detectives in the central district of Glasgow—in consequence of instructions, I endeavoured to arrest Barron and Stephen—on 10th May I was in Glasgow, when I saw Machattie—I followed him from the shipping office to the Central Station in Glasgow—in consequence of something I saw in the Victoria Hotel, I went in and made inquiries—I went into the billiard-room, and saw Machattie, Barron, and two other gentlemen—I went up to Barron and asked him if Lambert Barron was his name—he said it was—I said a warrant had been granted for his arrest in London—Machattie said, "Is there a warrant for me?"—I said, "Not that I know of"—I took Barron up to his room, took possession of his luggage, and found certain telegrams upon him—the first was handed in at the Aberdeen office at 1.12. (<hi rend="italic">These were from</hi> "Jack"<hi rend="italic">and</hi> "John,"<hi rend="italic">asking Barron to come to Aberdeen, and then not to come</hi>)—there was also a telegram to Machattie</p>
