On the 3rd of May the prisoner came to me, and hired a horse and chaise-cart, which I let him, and he took them away the same day - the horse was property harnessed; he said he wanted it to go to Chelmsford, to the election, and he should be back in seven days - he agreed to pay me seven guineas for the week, and said if I went to the Bull, at Aldgate, he should get some money from the committee to pay for it - I agreed to let him have it for the week for seven guineas; he said his expences would be paid by the committee, who sat in Whitechapel, who would advance him the money - he had the horse, cart, harness, and a whip to drive with. I never saw him again till the 23rd of May, when he was at Worship-street - he was to have been back on the 10th; I made inquiry after him, but heard nothing of him - he gave me his card as living at No. 75, Aldersgate-street; I inquired for him there, and found he had lived there, but had left there some time - it was not his address at the time he hired the horse and cart; I saw him at Worship-street on the 23rd - the cart and horse were there: I had advertised them, offering 5l. reward, and found him in custody two days after - my horse was worth 20l., and the chaise-cart 12l., including the harness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish him to produce the advertisement. Witness. Here it is, in the Morning Advertiser of the 21st of May.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was I not in treaty between two and three years ago, to purchase the horse and cart of you? A. It may have been nearly two years since I saw him; after I bought the cart he came and asked if I would part with it, and I never saw him afterwards - there was no bargain about it - he only hired it for a week; I have a memorandum here in his own writing - he gave it to me at the committee-room; I saw him write it - (read) - "Mr. Macbeth, I agree to pay seven guineas for the hire of the horse and cart for one week, Thomas Shearman, Stretton Arms, Carthusian-street, Charterhouse-square;" I inquired there, and found he had lodged there, but not at the time - here is another note, which he wrote to me from Chelmsford; I cannot swear it is his writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I admit the letter, and wish to have it read;(read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Macbeth, stable-keeper, Great Red Lion-street, Holborn, London. Chelmsford, 7th of May, 1831. SIR, - The election is all over at Colchester, and I am here; there is an old gentleman here, who has taken a fancy to your old horse, and if you will set the lowest price you will take for him, you may have a customer for the set-out altogether, and I will give you an order for the money on a house in Lombard-street - send an answer by return of post, directed to me, to be left at the Post-office here till called for.

            . I sent no answer to that letter, but went down to Chelmsford; I could not find him there, nor hear any thing of him at the Post-office, or of the horse and cart; I made inquiry about him from time to time, without success.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM WILLIAMS. I am ostler to Mr. Macbeth. I saw master and the prisoner go out of the yard together in the cart, and on the 23rd a man came and gave information that he knew where the horse and cart were - I went and found the horse in Moor-lane, at Salt's livery-stables; the prisoner was not there - I saw him at Worship-street; the same horse and cart were there, and the same harness, except the collar, which was changed - the breeching was gone, also the whip and horse-cloth; the whip had the name of Charles Fowler on it - I have since seen the whip in the Policeman's hands.</p>

            . I am an oilman and grocer, and live at Hornchurch, in Essex, about fifteen miles from London. -I saw the prisoner first about three weeks before he offered this horse and cart for sale - he then told me he had been down to Essex, to an election; and I think about a week before I saw him in custody he drove up to my house, No. 8, Church-street, Mile-end New-town - he said he had been to Chelmsford and Colchester elections, and had driven up two or three publicans - I said, "Is this your horse and chaise-cart?" he said Yes, it belonged to him - I said I wanted one, and asked what he wanted for it; he asked thirty-four guineas - I called out a friend who was a judge<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300004"/>of it; he thought it would suit me, and I was to meet the prisoner at the Grey Hound, Smithfield, to go to Hampstead-road, where he was going - I was to go there to see how the horse would go; I said I wanted to go to Webber-row, Blackfriars - he said he wanted to go to Hampstead-road, and said he would drive me round there; I was to meet him at three o'clock on the Sunday following, to try the horse and, drive there - I did not go, as a person stepped up and said I had better have nothing to do with him, and the bargain went off; as I did not go to the Grey Hound, the prisoner called at my place about nine days afterwards, on a Friday - I was not at home, but heard he had called.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear the prosecutor had lest his horse and chaise? A. On the Sunday - I was at Hornchurch, and when I returned my wife told me of the advertisement; I went to Machin's stable, in Fann-street, Aldersgate-street - I made inquiry, but did not see the horse and cart there; I went to Macbeth's on the Monday, and told him what had passed between me and the prisoner; I afterwards saw him at Worship-street, and am quite sure of his person - I took Macbeth's ostler and three Policemen, and found the horse at Salt's livery-stables, Moor-lane, and the cart and harness in a court in Whitecross-street, in possession of two men named Page and Crowder; they were moving it away while I was in the yard - I offered to buy it, to stop its being carried away, and Crowder offered it to me for 12l.; when the Policemen came up, I said I would have nothing to do with it - I had watched them remove it from Salt's stables to Whitecross-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How many men have you hailed above in a night at Sergeant's Inn, in Term time? A. None at all - I have justified bail three times; I never bought any stolen blue; I was never advertised as a swindler.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You have said you are an oilman and grocer, at Hornchurch - do you carry on any business there? A. Yes, I bought the lease of the house - I live there, and carry on business.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you not offer to pay me in brick-dust and sawdust, which your stock consists of? A. I offered you the money if the horse would suit me; a person stepped up, said you had been in the pillory, and told me to have nothing to do with you - I had not a farthing for bailing the three men; they were customers of mine.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Have you a residence at Mile-end? A. I lived there at the time the prisoner made me this offer, as well as at Hornchurch - I left Mile-end about a week ago; my family have gone down there - I carried on the oil and colour trade in Church-street, but I carry on that and the grocery business too at Hornchurch.</p>
               <p>TRUEMAN MACHIN. I keep stables in Fann-street. The prisoner brought the horse and cart to my stables on the 10th of May, and took them away on the 18th - they were within a mile and a half of the prosecutor's all that time; he did not say who they belonged to - he paid for the keep; he only went out with them once, and returned in the evening; he never used them again till he and another person took the horse and chaise away - he paid for the keep, as if he was the owner; I did not know that they were the prosecutor's at that time.</p>
               <p>CHARLES CROWDER. I am a publican, and live at No. 45, Golden-lane - I have known the prisoner some time. On the 18th of May he came to my house, and told me he knew of a horse that would suit me - he took me to Machin's stables, the White Horse, in Fann-street; I saw the horse and cart there - he asked if I thought the horse would suit me; I said I did not know till I rode it- I lent him 2l. to pay for the keep at the livery-stable; Machin would not let it came out without - I then drove it to my house, and went from there along Old-street; I observed the horse was lame, and told him it would not suit me - no price was set on it; he told me to take the horse, cart, and harness to my stables till he paid me the 2l. - he did not mention Macbeth's name to me; I was to work the horse for its keep - I drove it to Epsom races, and the following Monday the prosecutor claimed it; the prisoner was then at my house, and I sent for him to answer for himself; I was where the cart was found, and directed my servant to go and have him apprehended - it was done.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I believe I asked you to lend me the money till I could make my payment good for the hire of it? A. I knew nothing of his having hired it - I supposed it to be his own; I lent him the money to pay for the keep - he never told me he had hired it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner to TRUEMAN MACHIN. Q.Did you object to the horse and cart coming away till the keep was paid for? A. Yes - I make it a rule that the keep should be paid for before 1 part with a horse.</p>

No - the City Arms were on it when I bought it, but they have been taken off these two years, as I am not free; I did not know of the name and address being off till it was at Worship-street - I did not ask fourteen guineas for the week's hire; I agreed the week before to let it to you for 3l., but you did not tell me where it was going - when I let it you were to pay seven guineas.</p>

Smith and Son; (looking at a cheque) this cheque was presented to me at our banking-house on Monday. the 23rd of May, by the prisoner, and on my taking it from his hand, I said, "How will you take it?" he said, "Short;" I said, "A 100l. note" - he rather hesitated, and then said, "No, two fiftys;" I perceived the signature was different from the usual way of signing, and inquired if he took it himself of Messrs.

Smith, of Aldersgate-street, grocers - I took from him twelve sovereigns and some silver, which were given up to him by order of the Magistrate; I believe I said to him, "How could you be so foolish?" he said he was in great distress - I said that could not be, it was impossible he could be in distress, as he had 12l. or 13l. in his pocket.</p>

            . I am labourer to Mr. Cane - the prosecutor is his bailiff. On Friday morning, the 13th of May, in consequence of something I heard, I went to Barrett, the constable of Whitton, and went with him to the prisoner's house - the prisoner was at home, and in bed; Barrett took him into custody, and left me in charge of the house - Barrett returned in about an hour; this was between ten and eleven o'clock - about twenty minutes after he returned, I saw him find two parts of a flitch of bacon, which I knew - I had seen it every day in master's house, which the prosecutor lives in; I can safely swear it is the bacon I had seen in Gordon's house - it is his bacon.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the bacon in the house a whole flitch, or part of one? A. Part of a flitch - it was in one piece in the house; I know it by its appearance - I saw a piece cut out of it the night before, and when the constable drew it out from under the bed he said, "Do you know this?" I said Yes - I had seen it so many times in the house I can swear to it - the two pieces found join together. I have no mark on them.</p>

            . I am a labourer. I heard of Gordon's robbery, and saw the prisoner in the cage at Hounslow on Thursday afternoon - he asked me if I would change jackets with him - he said "Because the old woman can swear to that jacket;" he said he would send my jacket back again, and his wife was to have his back - he said his was better than mine; I did not change with him: he put the jacket between the bars, between eight and nine o'clock, and told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300007"/>me to strip; I would not - his wife took it away: I went up the street, leaving it in her possession.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The jacket, I believe, has never been found? A. I have not seen it; mine is here, which he wanted to exchange for it - he told me he had had the jacket in his possession about two years - that it had been laying about in his box, and he had never worn it, but he said the old woman said she could swear to it; I had been looking out for work two or three days before this - I had not been at Gordon's; I live at Hounslow - I did not tell the officer of this conversation; I told my father of it at breakfast next morning - he went and told the constable, and they sent for me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a jacket was it? A. A white flannel one, such as labourers usually wear.</p>

C., and here is a rent where the mark was, and a patch put on: here is the mark of some liver and crow on it, by which I know it - the constable brought the prisoner out of the cage at Hounslow to me on the Friday afternoon, about one o'clock; I observed the jacket he had on, and knew it - it was my husband's: I knew it by the mark where the binding was loosened behind - the constable said, "What do you think of it?" I said, in the prisoner's presence, "That will do;" the constable sent me out of the room while he had some refreshment, and then put him in the cage again.</p>

The prisoner was three weeks in our service. - On Saturday night, the 21st of May, I went with my husband to Cooke's-circus; we returned about a quarter-past twelve o'clock, and about two the next day the prisoner came up to me in the bed-room, and said dinner was ready- I asked her to fasten my dress, which she could not, and after she was gone down I stooped down, and observed something shining on the bed-room floor; I picked it up, and found it was a ruby - I then found several more: I went down stairs to my husband, asked if he had been to his drawer that morning, and told him what I had found; I found the keys of the drawers in a drawer which I had placed them in the evening before - my husband opened the drawer with the key, in my presence; the prisoner had seen me place some rubies in that drawer about a fortnight before - when my husband examined the drawer there were still some rubies and emeralds there; I could not tell how many were missing - we searched all over the floor of the room, and found a few more rubies: I asked the prisoner if she had been to the drawer - she said she had not; she said Mr. Meredith, a lodger, had asked her a great many questions, and she should not be surprised if it was him; the constable was sent for Mr. Meredith, and his room was searched, but nothing was found either on him or in his room - this was at half-past three o'clock that afternoon: I afterwards went to my father's, and returned about halfpast eight o'clock - I saw the prisoner in the back parlour- the constable was searching her boxes: she asked him to allow her to speak to me - I said nothing to induce her to confess: I did not either threaten or promise her, nor did my husband or the constable - she said she had been to the drawer out of curiosity, to look at the stones, and if I searched the room farther I should still find the remainder of the stones that were missing; I told her she knew to the countrary of that, as we had searched before there - she then said she had taken them, and thrown them away down the water-closet, and into the dust-hole; she begged I would plead for her - I told her I would as far as prudence would allow me: that was after she made this statement; that was all she said to me about it - I afterwards had the dust-hole and water-closet examined, but none of them were found in either place; she did not tell me how the drawer was opened.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You told me you had been robbed twice before I came, and you did not think I should do it, became I did not know a ruby from glass. Witness, I said we had been robbed twice before she came - we had lost a writing-desk out of the front parlour, and a table-clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. All the lodgers had access to your bed-room, and you were very careless in letting property lay about - there were things in the kitchen and in my bed-room, which I could have taken. Witness. There are many things laying about at a jeweller's house which it is impossible to lock up - a gentleman left a gold chain in the kitchen for a week; there might have been rings in the prisoner's bed-room at times - I never knew her to go to my drawer; I am sure she saw me put some rabies into my drawer about a fortnight before, and saw the stones in the drawer - I had her character from Mr. Payne, a butcher, of Lamb's Conduit-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Your brother was at work in the house till eight o'clock, and complained to me that Mackie had gone out, and there were seven lodgers besides. Witness. A brother of mine was at work there - we have a lady lodging on our first floor; we had only one lady in the house at the time of the robbery, but we have four ladies lodge in the house - they are respectable; all the lodgers have access to the room; the drawer is in the second floor front room, which is my bed-room; Mr. Meredith lodged in the back room second floor - we found nothing in her boxes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Mr. McCree lodged there, and was going away the day before - master told me to look sharp after him. Witness. Mr. McCree left on the Saturday night,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300008"/>about half-past eleven o'clock - he was a medical student; he boarded with us, and slept on the third floor - he is a youth sixteen years old.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Do you know of your husband telling her to look sharp after him? A. No - I knew him to be a very respectable young man; the keys were kept in a drawer in the bed-room; she must have occasionally seen me put the keys in the drawer.</p>
               <p>JAMES MACKIE. I am the prosecutor. I kept my loose stones in a drawer in the bed room - they were polished; in consequence of what my wife said I went up about two o'clock and looked at the drawer - I had slept in that room the night before, and got up about half-past eleven; on examining the drawer I found it locked - I opened it with the key, and found nothing the matter with the lock; when I unscrewed the ruby-box, which was kept in that drawer, I found full half of them were gone - there had been about seventy carats in the box; there now remains forty-one - I had not seen the box for four or five days; I opened the ruby-box in the prisoner's presence - I took the drawer out, and set it on a chair by the window, and on opening the emerald-box, I said, "Why, half of these are gone;" she immediately said, "Oh Jesus Christ! it was not me, as God is my judge it was not me!" I examined the emerald-box in her presence - there were fourteen carats left out of thirty; I had not seen that box for four or five days - I never go to it unless some of the workmen want them; I cannot say when I had seen them last, in fact Mrs. Mackie put the rubies and emeralds there the last time - I had weighed them about a week before; the box was so full that the lid would hardly go down on it - the ruby-box was particularly full; I put twenty carats in one evening, and I think two more - it was so full I could scarcely get the lid down, and I thought to put them into another box; some of the rubies cost me three guineas a carat, some 40s., and some 25s. - I had seventy or eighty carats of the emeralds at one time; I had worked them down to the worst, and I would not have given above 20s. a carat for them.</p>
               <p>Q. When the prisoner used the expressions you mentioned had you charged her with stealing them? A. I had not, and I said, "Why, Ann, what is the use of your using those expressions, have I charged you with it, but your conduct appears very strange, I must confess.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she mention any other person whom she charged? A. Mr. Meredith - she mentioned his name; I sent for a constable, and searched Meredith's person and his room, but found nothing - I afterwards had a conversation with a Mr. Burgess; I have three rooms on a floor, and the conversation was in the middle parlour - I do not know that it was in the prisoner's hearing; Burgess had come about half-past eight o'clock that evening - I told him what had happened, asked him to walk up stairs, and I would show him where the things were taken from; I called to the prisoner to bring up a candle - I went up with him into the bed-room, and showed him our drawer; the prisoner did not go up with us, not to my knowledge - I went into Meredith's room; I got the candle, looked on the top of his bed, and when I came out of his room the prisoner walked into the room, and said to me, "Sir, what colour is a ruby, is it red or green?" I said, "Ann, you know the colour as well as I do, you saw me open the boxes to-day;" she then said, without stooping, "There lays a ruby on the floor," and there was one - I had said to Burgess before she came into the room, that if I was to find a ruby in the room. I should certainly suspect, but as it was I could not - I am not certain whether the prisoner heard this; I had not seen her from the time she gave me the candle, but she followed me up stairs though she was not required there - when she said there was a ruby on the floor we were in Meredith's middle room, the sitting-room; she picked it up herself, and put it into my hand - it was a ruby of the same description as I had lost; I had searched that room before for three or four hours - I searched it with the officers, and after they went away I searched it myself; I searched the place where she picked up the ruby, but I had found none - I had searched it down on my knees with my fingers all over the ground, with accuracy, and I am certain there was nothing there - when she picked it up she said, "Are you now satisfied who stole them?" I said, "I am satisfied now;" I immediately sent for a constable, and had her taken - the ruby found in the room might be worth 8s. or 9s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Directly you went up to the drawer to search, did you not say, "I know who has done this, it is Mr. McCree has been and spilled this about out of spite to me?" A. I did not - McCree had lodged with me six months; I had a dispute with him, and I believe I struck him - I said to Mrs. Mackie, "Surely Mr. McCree could not have gone to my drawer and spilled these about out of spite;" I did not say I would have him searched - I did not say, "I don't suspect you, Ann, you don't know a ruby from glass;" I said the best of the stones were gone - I did not say McCree had gone away in such a sly way I was determined to find him out, nor that I would find out Meredith's connexions - I said nothing, except that I was sorry the gentleman had been searched - I did not search the prisoner.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. I think you say Mr. McCree was highly respectable? A. Yes - he lodged six months with me; he was a very passionate young man - he did not leave London for a fortnight or three weeks after the robbery; I found nothing in the prisoner's possession.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What portion of the rubies and emeralds were actually found? A. Those about the room were about two and a half carats, which, put to what were in the box, made forty-one carats - none of the emeralds were found- I had no reason to believe Mr. McCree had done this out of spite; I merely said at the moment, "Surely McCree could not have scattered them out of spite;" no money was found in the prisoner's box.</p>

               <p>MRS. MACKIE. I cannot say to a few days when I had last seen the property - the prisoner saw me place them in the drawer about a fortnight before; I had been to the drawer about a week before - I did not unscrew either of the boxes; I had not seen the rubies or emeralds for some time - it was rather more than a fortnight before that I had placed them there in her presence; I placed them there in her presence for a particular purpose - she came to me on the Saturday night, and on the following Tuesday I let Meredith the apartment, and two or three days after she came down and said, "Dear me, ma'am, it is a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300009"/>very strange gentleman we have taken in, he is always asking me how many rooms there are in the house, and how many lodgers;" I said, "You could very well tell him that;" she said, "Then he asked me how many workmen ther were, and how much gold there was in the shop;" I said, "There is not much gold;" I said so, thinking to deceive each party - I was rather alarmed at it, and said, "Ann bring the candle, I will go up into the shop and lock up what things I think are portable;" and as we were leaving the room my husband said, "Charlotte, I have left my ruby and emerald box by the side of my place; there are a great many rubies in the box; 20l. worth might be taken out, and I might not miss them;" this was in the prisoner's presence - I then brought the ruby and emerald boxes from the shop and locked them in this drawer; she asked me at the time the value of some stones there, particularly a yellow crystal - I told her they were of no value.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not bring a large stone to the bed and show me, then take me to the closet where the silver spoons and things were, and show me some pieces of gold in the shop, and say you should not like them to be lost? A. I might have said I should not like it to be lost - she held the candle while I locked the things up- we have left the key of the shop on the back parlour mantel-piece when we have gone out; there has been valuable things in the shop at the time - I did not make the prisoner any promise; I asked her in the morning if she had been to the drawer out of curiosity, and in the evening she made use of my words and said she had been out of curiosity.</p>
               <p>MR. MACKIE. I never used any threat or promise to her in the morning when she was stating she was innocent - I said, "Ann, if you have been to the drawer from curiosity, and spilt the stones on the floor, and I find them all, I will say no more about it."</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come into the parlour and fall on my knees, crying? A. You never fell on your knees till you were taken into custody at eleven o'clock at night; you then tell on your knees and begged for mercy, and I said I would have nothing to say to you - I did not hear her make any statement that night.</p>

            . I went to lodge at Mr. Mackie's on the 3rd of May, a little more than a fortnight before the robbery - I had not the slightest knowledge where he kept his rubies or emeralds; I had none in my room on the Sunday, nor did I ever drop any on the carpet - I did not take these rubies or emeralds; I recollect asking the prisoner how many lodgers there were in the house, but never asked her about gold or jewels, or put any question to her bearing any resemblance to it - I went home on Saturday evening, about seven o'clock I think; I did not leave my room that night, nor on the following morning, till after this investigation took place - I went to bed between eight and nine o'clock on the Saturday night, and about twelve I was awoke by a great noise in my outer room, my sitting room, and immediately after the prisoner opened the bed-room door, and seeing me in bed she seemed much alarmed, and was going out; I told her not to be alarmed, but to hold me the candle that I might see the time - I saw it wanted twenty minutes to twelve - my sitting room is between my bed-room and Mr. Mackie's bed-room; they are all on the same floor - mine is the back room, and his bed-room is in front; I said nothing more to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q.Did you not, when you came in to tea one evening, ask what lodgers and what rooms were in the house, and say, "I suppose there is plenty of gold in the house?" A. The first part of her question is true, the latter is totally false.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to Mackie's house on the Sunday night, about twelve o'clock - I went up to the sitting room on the second floor, and asked the prisoner how she came to place that ruby on the floor; she said, "To make it appear as if Mr. Meredith put it there;" those were her words to me - she said, "As he might be apprehended;" I took her into custody, and took her down to the kitchen to get her bonnet - she resisted being taken, and said I will tell my mistress all about it; I did not make her any threat or promise; as she was shutting the kitchen door, I heard her say, "I did go to the drawer;" that was all I heard then - I pulled her up stairs to get her away; she then went into the parlour where Mrs. Mackie was sitting - she threw herself on her knees, and begged for mercy - Mrs. Mackie expressed herself very angry with her, and desired me to take her away; she then took hold of Mrs. Mackie, and took her into the front parlour - I overheard her say in a loud tone,"I threw them into the dust-hole;" and I think she mentioned the privy at the same time - I then went into the room and took her away, and on the way to the watch-house, she said, "I know I told my mistress I took them, and threw them down the dust-hole and the privy, but she said it was Mr. Meredith that had stolen them;" I afterwards had occassion to ask her what man she had had in the house on the Saturday night; she said it was a man who I saw she had a letter from in Green-street, a sweetheart - I said, "I understand you had him there late on Saturday night, and that he was seen to go in there early on Sunday morning" - she said he was there.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. You said, "If you have not done the robbery, Meredith has;" Witness. I did not; I knew nothing about Meredith till the next day - I searched the prisoner and found nothing on her.</p>
               <p>MR. MACKIE. The last time I saw the rubies and emeralds was the evening my wife brought them down to put them into the drawer, which was about eight or nine days before the robbery - I saw the rubies in particular, and the emerald box also - it was then I found a difficulty to screw the ruby box up; I saw the emeralds about a day before- that box was half full; (looking at a ruby produced by Schofield) that is the ruby she picked up on the floor.</p>
               <p>BURGESS. I called on the Sunday evening, about hald-past eight o'clock, at Mr. Mackie's - the prisoner let me in; I asked her if Mr. or Mrs. Mackie were at home - she said Mr. Mackie was, but Mrs. Mackie was gone out; she immediately began to tell me that Mr. Mackie's drawer had been forced open over night, and a quantity of stones taken from it, and that suspicion fell on Mr. Meredith - I told her I did not wish to know further about it; I wished to see Mr. Mackie as she seemed to wish to press the subject very much; I afterwards saw Mr. Mackie, and had some conversation with him; he asked me to go up stairs to see the confused state in which the lodger's apartments were, and said if he could find one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300010"/>stone in the lodger's apartment he should be satisfied - the prisoner was standing close by at the time; she asked Mr. Mackie what colour the stones were - he said she knew very well, and about a minute afterwards she said, "Here is a stone on the floor;" and picked it up - what Mr. Mackie has said upon that subject is quite correct.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Had you heard of Mr. Mackie's loss before you called at the house? A. No - the prisoner told me without my asking any questions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When the prisoner apparently picked up the ruby, did you say any thing? A. I asked if she picked up the ruby, or whether she had placed it there - she swore by G - d she had found it there; I afterwards saw her in Schofield's custody - she said, in my hearing, that she had taken the ruby from Mr. Mackie's room, and put it into Mr. Meredith's room, in order to have him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not come up after master with a light? A. Yes, but he had got one already, and had not called for one - you came into the room after us.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said I had found a ruby in Mr. Mackie's room - you said, "Where is it?" I said, "I have let it drop on the carpet, and there it is;" you said, "Are you sure you picked it up?" I said, "Yes, I picked it up in mistress' room, and put it there;" Witness. Yes, that is true - she said she had put it into Meredith's room, in order to have him taken into custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury - I am here, unfortunately, charged with robbing my master of rubies and stones, which I am innocent of: I unfortunately went to live with Mr. Mackie, with a good character, on the 30th of April last - I had not been in the house three days before my mistress took in a gentleman-lodger, without any reference; there were six lodgers in the house besides him - he came about one o'clock in the day after the lodging, and at six o'clock the same evening - he came to stay; he had not been in the house four days before he questioned me several times how many lodgers there were in the house, and if there was not plenty of gold up in the shop - I told him I did not know any thing about it, as I had not been long in the house myself; I instantly went and told my mistress of it, and she thought it a very strange question to ask me; she then went up stairs, and looked over all her things - the lodgers had all access to her bed-room, except Mr. Meredith; my mistress was very careless with her property- her keys and jewellery used to lay over all parts of the house; I often told her that she was very careless in letting her things lay about - my mistress told me that she had been rubbed twice within three months before I went there, and how is it possible that I can be answerable for her property? I had plenty of opportunities if I was that way inclined - my mistress has been out plenty of times, and left the keys about, and never any thing lost before; I solemnly declare that I am innocent of the crime that I am charged with on the fatal night that I suppose the robbery was committed, as it could not be done on the Sunday morning, as my master was in bed all the morning previous to my mistress finding it out: my master and mistress went to the play on Saturday night - they returned about a quarter-past ten o'clock; Mr. Meredith came in about seven o'clock with a latchkey, and it so happened that a gentleman-lodger went away the night the place was robbed; my master gave particular orders to watch the gentleman that went away, which I did not take any heed of, as I knew he was embittered against him concerning some words which occurred the night before - when my master and mistress came, it was about a quarter-past ten, and my master asked me if Mr. Meredith was in; I said No, as I did not know that he was in at the time, not having been up stairs; my mistress said, "You must get him a rushlight," which I forgot, and they went out again - in the meantime I was ironing; a thought came into my head, that I had not turned down her bed - I ran up stairs to do it - I was not two minutes in the room, nor I never saw her keys, nor never such a thought came into my head; I also went into Mr. Meredith's room, and to my great surprize I found him in bed, which frightened me very much, and I screamed out - he appeared very much confused- he told me not to be alarmed, but to bring the light, for he wanted to see what o'clock it was; he held the watch in his hand - I went down stairs, and my master knocked at the door; I told him that I had been very much frightened, and likewise told them how frightened Mr. Meredith was, which they laughed very much at; we all went to bed - on the next day my mistress was dressing herself - she came down to my master, and told him how she saw the little stones lay about the carpet; they both went up stairs, and I went up to see what was the mattermy master took the drawer out in my presence, and said that he knew very well who had done this - he said, "Mr. McCree has been to the drawer, and spilt them out of spite;" my mistress said, "Is there any lost?" he said, "No, I do not think there is any gone;" my mistress said she did not think that Mr. McCree would do such a thing - they then had suspictor of Mr. Meredith; my master then recollected what Mr. Meredith asked me about the gold - I was called up to face him before my mistress, that he did say so; he denied it, but I could take an oath he said it - my master said, "If any one else has got my property I will go on my knees, and beg your pardon;" they then had him searched, and my master said, "I cannot give him into custody, or else he will bring an action against me for false imprisonment;" about six o'clock he took his leave to go away - my master and all of them said, that he behaved very strange in going away as he did; my master said to me, in the kitchen, "Your mistress has done a very wrong thing, for she told him that she had been robbed;" after an hour had elapsed she sent for an officer, and him and me were searched, but they found nothing on either of us; my master said, "Whoever has robbed me is a judge of those things, for they have picked out the most valuable stones;" he said, "I do not suspect you, as you would not know rubies from glass;" it all passed on until nine o'clock - I went up stairs to turn down the bed, and I was looking about the carpet; I found a small stone, and on my oath I never had one in my hand before, nor saw one; my master suspected I had more about me, and he sent for an officer, and gave me into custody - they searched me again, but found nothing about me, nor at any of my friends; my mistress said that she would forgive me if I would say I was guilty, but if not she would send me to Newgate, which so frightened me that I did not know what I said - she asked me if I had put them down the water-closet, or the dust-bin, or if I had them any where - I told them they had better go and look, which she immediately did, but found none; the officer was sent for to take me into custody - I fell upon my knees, and begged her not to send me, as I knew I was innocent: I solemnly declare, Gentlemen of the Jury, as I shall have to answer before that awful Judge, when all hearts will be open, that I am quite innocent of the crime alleged to me, and must, therefore, throw myself on the mercy of the Court.</p>

               <p>Two witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That is a good price? A. No, it was a very good calf; I had two more calves - they were not marked in the same way; it was very uncommonly marked with a blaze of white in the face- there are not many with such a blaze as that; it was a particularly white mark that I knew it by; (looking at the skin) you do not see a mark like that in one in five thousand, but this skin is dry now - it was narrow at the middle, and wide at the end; if I had seen it fifty miles off I should not have sworn to it - the meat and all was on it when found; the meat and the bones made it all perfect.</p>
               <p>Q. Are not calves always tied up by the nose? A. No, not exactly that tie; if I had seen it in Yorkshire I could have told it was my calf's head - there is very little hair on two of the feet, but I know it was white; I had seen the calf twice every day for seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the feet found in the prisoner's pocket been boiled? A. I do not know - they had been in scalding water I dare say; the hair was off - they could not have eat them without boiling them; I did not fit the feet to the marks - part of the road I traced them in is public, but some of it is a bye road.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. You do not speak so particularly to the skin now, as you do to the head; had you any doubt of it when it was found fresh? A. I was positive of it; I should say that the feet found in the prisoner's pocket had been white.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Why, is the colour of the skin different, when it had been covered with white hair, than with black? A. The skin is generally white; if the calf had black legs the skin looks black.</p>

            . I am a constable of Friern, Barnet. On Sunday morning, about seven o'clock, I went with the prosecutor to the prisoner's cottage - I saw him coming up the lane; I said, "Evans, I want you - I have business with you;" he said, "What do you want?" I said, "I have a warrant to search your house for a stolen calf;" he said, "You can go without me;" I said, "You must go with me," and took him back - I found the two feet in his pocket, and went to a ditch near the hovel, where I found two calves' feet and the entrails - a little further I found the body of a calf; a little further on Holman found the head and two feet; he said, "That is my calf's head, any how."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Were the feet found in the prisoner's pocket boiled? A. No - they were not, for there were white hairs left on; it had been partly hooked off, and warm water put on - they had not been boiled, but coddled; I found nothing in the prisoner's house - the prisoner did not say he was going to Brook-green: the ditch is about twenty yards from the hovel, down at the bottom of his garden - the hovel was on his premises; nothing was found there, but by going into the hovel I saw the window was open and nettles broken down, as if something had been dragged out to the very place where the calf lay - it gave me a fair track; I do not think I mentioned that before; any body might have access to the ditch - the hovel was unlocked and the key hanging loose to the door.</p>

               <p>MR. HOLMAN. It was Saturday morning that I traced the marks, but I took the prisoner on the Sunday morning, and then we found the calf - I did not get the warrant till late at night.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not you know he was in the habit of going to cut down nettles and things in the ditch? A. Yes, but he had not any thing to do it with that morning - he went through empty handed; he could not have had his tools in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Would not his pockets hold a pair of scissors or a knife? A. Yes, but they would not cut enough to clear a ditch out - he did not drag the calf there when I saw him- he had no jacket on; he was dressed in breeches and shirt-sleeves.</p>

            . I am journeyman to Mr. Young, a butcher, of Baker-street - I have been a butcher seven years; I saw the different parts of the calf on Monday morning - they are all here; I have not a doubt that they all belong to the same animal; the two hind feet and one fore foot were cut off at the proper joint, the other was not - they all corresponded; the two fore feet were white: the two hind ones had been scalded, but I think they were white for they have white tufts corresponding with the two fore feet; if they had not been white feet they would have been a darker colour - I have not a doubt all the feet belonged to the same calf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you call the feet which were found on the prisoner white? A. Not now, because they have been laying so long; there is as much hair on them now as when found - they have been scalded too much, and then the hair does not come off properly; a good deal of the flesh has been taken off with a sharp knife - I will not swear the hair on this leg may not have been black; there is very little grazing in that part of the country - my master has two or three calves every week; there are six butchers in the place.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were the two feet dressed as butcher's would dress them? A. No - I fitted the bind feet to the joints; they fitted exactly - I have not a doubt they belonged to the same calf.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I feel it a duty incumbent on me, as well for the preservation of my character as for the ends of public justice, that I should make a few observations on the evidence that has been adduced to sustain the present charge, and I beseech you, as a British Jury, who believe in the divine attributes and value the sacred obligations of an oath, that before you come to any decided conclusion respecting such evidence, you will give it a mature deliberation. The evidence that has been adduced to you against me certainly appears suspicious, but I do most solemnly assure you that on the night of the robbery I was in my bed, and that I am entirely innocent of the charge brought against me; the constable and headborough, my Lord, have both known me a number of years, and never knew any thing wrong of my character - I have lived upwards of thirty years in the neighbourhood, and always bore a good character for honesty and sobriety. I humbly submit that it is not likely that a man of my time of life should be induced to commit so henious a crime for which I am now unfortunately arraigned at this bar. Since I have been in prison there have been frequent robberies committed in the neighbourhood, and no person has been found that committed them. As regards the tracing of the calf's feet, it was very easy for him to do it, being a regular road way, and fifty or sixty carts passing in the course of the day. and therefore I submit it was very easy.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of May last, in Bread-street, Cheapside; I told him I wanted him for a robbery - he said he knew nothing of it, and was willing to go any where.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence (written.) I am a weaver by trade. -About four years ago I was a journeyman, and by dint of industry saved a small sum of money, when I set up some looms, and became a small master for myself; as I had not a very extensive connexion, I was obliged to let my goods go to any person that was recommended to me, and by that means I used to sell many silk dresses, and at times I was obliged to barter for other commodities. A Mr. Rogers came to me, who lived in Quaker-street, Spitalfields, and offered to dispose of a silk dress for me, if I had one by me, and as he had done so before, I let him have one, but could not let it go under 1l. 16s., as there were twelve yards at 3s. per yard, and he said he would try and get it for me, as he supposed I had no objection to barter - I said No, providing the goods suited me; I accordingly let him have the dress, making him promise to return it or the money at night, as I was very short of business, it being on the decline at that time - he took it, and in the afternoon returned, said he had sold the dress, and the woman that he sold it to said she had not sufficient money to pay for it, unless he took something in exchange, and he promised to do so, when she showed him several things that was of no use to me; she at length showed him a watch, and wanted 1l. for it, but he objected to allow her so much, as it had no case, but offered to allow her 16s., when the bargain was made, and he brought me the watch and 1l. in money, making together the 1l. 16s. I have a family of four young children, and my wife is expected to be confined with a fifth daily; I was only away fifteen months - I went to Braintree because I could not maintain my wife and family; Tyrrell has known me eighteen or nineteen years.</p>
               <p>ROBERT TYRRELL. I have known him about seventeen years - he was a weaver; I always considered him honest till this occurred.</p>

            , JUN. I am the prosecutor's son. On the night of the 28th of May I left the house, leaving nobody in it - I double locked the door, and was very particular in doing so; I took the key with me - the shutters were bolted fast, and fastened at the bottom besides; I went to a public-house in the neighbourhood, and in about ten minutes I was alarmed - I went directly towards my father's house, and found the door open - no violence had been committed; the shutters and the back door were as I had left them - I went up stairs to the looms; I had left some silk velvet safe in my loom - I found the made-work cut out and gone; I missed fourteen or fifteen yards of silk velvet from my loom, and thirty-eight yards of silk from my father's - we call it three singles; I afterwards saw the property at the station-house - we were working it for Mr. Walters; I afterwards saw the Policeman try a key to the lock - it opened it as easy as the right one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Are you in your father's service? A. No. I work for my master, and am paid for what I do; there is no partnership between us.</p>
               <p>ESTHER RIMES. I am single, and live in West-street, Bethnal-green. On Saturday night, the 28th of May, I went to the prosecutor's house to pay a visit - it was about half-past nine o'clock when I got to the door; my sister, who was with me, said something, and I observed two persons come out of Barrett's door - the prisoner is one of them; the other man came out first - the prisoner had a basket in his hand, with something black hanging out at the end of it; they both ran out of the house - when the first ran out I had no suspicion, but when the second ran I thought it was the work that he had, and I screamed out Stop thief! the prisoner ran in the opposite direction, more in the middle of the road - he then turned the corner, ran down another street, turned another corner, and in the next street I saw him taken; I had followed him, and never lost sight of him till he was taken - he put the basket down immediately before he was taken, and then walked; a person passing stopped him - the Policeman came up, and he was given into custody; the basket was picked up, and given to me- I took it to the station-house, and gave it in the charge of a person there; I saw that it contained silk.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was this? A. Halfpast nine o'clock - I live a good way from Barrett's; I went to tell him I was coming to dine with him on the Sunday - the prisoner ran down three streets; I never saw him before - I was on the step of the door when they both came running out right facing me; I swear to him from seeing him at the door - I did not lose sight of him in turning the corner; I never lost sight of him - I had not knocked at the door.</p>

I was in Edward-street about twenty minutes after nine o'clock - I passed the prosecutor's door, and saw two men about six feet from the door; I lost sight of them in a moment - I went about fifty yards up the street, came back again, and when within fifteen yards of the door, I saw two women at the door, and saw two men come out of the house; the second one had a basket - the females called Murder! Stop thief! I saw the man run across into Thomas-street - I was opposite,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300014"/>I went into Busby-street, and met the prisoner full butt with the basket; about twelve feet before he came up to me he stopped and dropped it - I collared him, he asked what for, I pointed to the basket, and said, "Look at what you have dropped;" he said he knew nothing about it, and said,"There he goes," pointing to the other who was running - I took him back about forty yards; he then made a desperate resistance, and got his hand into his pocket- I said, "He has got a picklock-key or something in his pocket, let us search him;" the mob said, "It is more than you dare do," and at that moment he threw something out of his pocket - I afterwards returned to the spot, and saw Moore pick up a key; it was given to a Policeman, who I saw try it to the prosecutor's door, and it opened it.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I have a key, which I got from Moore - I tried it to Barrett's door, which it opened easily; here is the velvet and silk which I saw taken out of the basket.</p>

I was full three parts up the street, walking at my usual pace - he said, "Look what you have dropped;" I said "I have dropped nothing, if any body has dropped any thing it is that man who is running up Hare-street;" well, there were about eight of them all seized me - I said, "I will not go further till a Policeman comes, and then I will go any where you choose," and about an hour afterwards they brought a key forward from Thomas-street, where two men had run up - I was at my aunt's house at a quarter-past nine o'clock on Saturday night.</p>

I was on duty in the Lower-road, Islington, on the 27th of May, about a quarter before three o'clock in the morning - I saw three men cross the road in a direction from Tuffnelplace towards Green Man's-lane; I followed them, suspecting them - they saw me, and ran away; I sprung my rattle, and called Stop thief! in my pursuit I picked up a hat, with a piece of flannel in it - I lost sight of them for about a minute at the bottom of the lane, and then saw some constables in pursuit of them; I did not see them taken, for I went in another direction, thinking to meet them - they were taken before I came up; I found the prisoners in custody of Canty and Meadows - when I came up Vincent said, "That is my hat, but you have put something into it;" we took them to the watch-house,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300015"/>then went to Tuffnel-place, and found Mr. Pugh's garden-gate ajar - I went in, and found some things scattered about on the lawn; the kitchen window was up, and the shutter was bored with a centre-bit - the bar was bent; the shutter was lined with iron, but the centre-bit was used as far as it could be - I went into the dining-room, found the drawers open, the things in confusion, and thrown about; I have brought what I found on the lawn here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You lost sight of the persons for three or four minutes? A. No - I lost sight of one of them; I never said I could not swear to them, I said I had not the least doubt of them - they were out of my sight for a minute; I do not swear to them certainly.</p>

On the 27th of May I heard a rattle spring in the Lower-road - I stood where I was in Tibberton-square; I heard a foot advancing to me, and three men ran right abreast of me - I sprang my rattle, crying Stop thief! I was immediately assisted by other officers, and stopped them; they took two roads - I stopped Richmond, and Meadows stopped Vincent, who had no hat on - Richmond did not get out of my sight; I found on him three table and three desert spoons, one tea and one caddy spoon, one pair of sugar-tongs, and one shift; they were in his body coat - also a pair of woman's lace boots, a pair of child's shoes, and he had an umbrella in his hand; he said I had a prize, nothing more - I gave the things up to the inspector of our division, and got them from him this morning; I know they are the same as I gave him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that? A. I marked them all, except the umbrella, and that mark is worn off by the heat of my hand to-day - I marked the shoes J. C. on the soles.</p>

            . I lived at No. 8, Almonry, Westminster, when this happened. On the night of the transaction I was in Dyer's shop, Tothill-street - Howard was there; Phillips stood at the side of the door - it was a little before one o'clock in the morning; the prisoner was in the shop - Phillips said to Howard, "I want to speak to you, Betsey, if you please;" she said, "I am coming;" the prisoner said, "What charge have you against this woman?" Phillips said, "I shan't detain her a minute," and they both walked out of the shop - the prisoner said nothing then; Phillips said again, "I want to speak to you, Betsey" they stood for a few moments, and the same words were repeated again, "I want to speak to you if you please," and the prisoner said to her, "You shan't go;" Phillips took his staff out of his pocket, and said to the prisoner, "Go back, or you will break the window."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he strike him, or strike at him, with his staff or any thing? A. No, nor was there any angry words, not in the least; Phillips and Betsey, and the prisoner likewise, then crossed over the road - they stood there a few moments, and the prosecutor again said, "I want to speak to you, if you please;" the prisoner said again, "You shan't go."</p>
               <p>Q. Was this after the staff had been drawn? A. Yes, and in a few minutes I saw him put his hand into his lefthand pocket, and with his right hand he stabbed Phillips; I could not see whether he took any thing out of his pocket - Phillips instantly exclaimed, "I am stabbed! I am stabbed! protect the prisoner, for that is the man that has done it;" he reeled as well as he could into Dyer's shop, holding his two hands where he was wounded - he was bent double, and the blood was running down; the prisoner exclaimed, "I have done nothing, so help me, God; what have I done?" I said, "You have stabbed Mr. Phillips, the Policeman, and he is in the cook-shop, having his wounds looked at;" I still remained in the cook-shop- I saw the prisoner secured at last by Ando.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the Policeman make any charge against the woman? A. No, not any in the least; nothing had been done when the Policeman took his staff out - he took it out to protect himself; nothing had been done to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it true that the prisoner had put his hands on him, or attempted to touch him at all at the time he took his staff out? A. No, not in the least - Elizabeth Howard was about five yards from the Policeman; he was not speaking to her at the time the prisoner struck him - I will swear that; I was very near Phillips - I cannot exactly say how near; I was near enough to see the deed done, not more than three yards off, and perfectly sober: I am an unfortunate girl; Mad Harriet is a nick-name that has been given me - I never told any body that I knew nothing of this transaction, nor any thing of the kind- I never said I did not see the prisoner stab the Policeman for any thing to that effect, to any body: I do not know

               <p>Q. Did you not swear you had not spoken to her since the transaction? A. Yes, but not about the transaction -I have spoken to her about twice; they came up and threatened my life - I was obliged to speak; I did swear that I had not spoken to her since the transaction, that is not true - I did not speak to her about Phillips' concern, but they threatened my life, because I was up against the prisoner; I did not speak to Howard of my own accord -I have not spoken to her above twice about Phillips' concern, nor about any thing else; I did not know the prisoner before - I was not long in the cook-shop; I had not drank any thing the whole day - I went in to get a basin of soup; I had no beer nor gin; I had not been to any public-house - I have not spoken to the prisoner's mother about this transaction.</p>

Yes, about a week after it took place - it happened on the 28th, and I was examined on a Saturday morning; I stated the same as I have now - I was at the Police-office twice, but was only examined once; I was to wait till the Policeman was able to come to give his evidence.</p>

            . I am a waiter at Dyer's cook-shop, in Tothill-street. The prisoner was there with a girl on the 28th of May, at very near one o'clock - they stood having a conversation together, when Phillips came up to the door and called Bet out - she went out; the prisoner followed her out - I thought I heard a few words, and went out to see what was the matter, but did not see any thing particular; Phillips said to the prisoner, "Come away, don't break the window;" he said so to the prisoner - Phillips and the girl crossed the road, and the prisoner followed after them; I went in doors to serve my customers, but had not been long before I heard Phillips sing out, "Stop him! stop him! I am stabbed! I am stabbed!" I went out, and the prisoner was walking some distance down the street, very deliberately - I went after him; Rierdon, the serjeant, came up - I took him into custody, and he was taken to the watch-house directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.How near were you to them when they crossed? A. I was close against the door; I suppose I was twenty yards when they crossed the way - the noise I heard certainly induced me to look out; when I saw them crossing I saw three or four women, but no other man - the women are here; I do not know the name of any body but Howard - there was Austin close along with them; she had been in our shop - she did nothing, to my know<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300018"/>ledge; I did not see the Policeman's staff out, but he might have drawn it out.</p>
               <p>Q. How near were you to him at the nearest time? A. About half a yard; I really do not recollect seeing the staff in his hand - it might have been, and I not noticed it.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where do you live? A. At Old Brompton - I had this conversation with her at Westminster, in one of the streets leading to Tothill-street; it was in the street - she was a perfect stranger to me; my son was with me, not the prisoner - he heard part of the conversation; he is not here - he was not acquainted with Austin.</p>
               <p>Q. You and your son, being perfect strangers to her, met her in the street, and began a conversation? A. Yes - nobody else was present; I met her the first time by myself, and some time after my son came up - I was talking to her then; I had seen her once before about the same place; the last conversation was a night or two before the second hearing; I had not been introduced to her at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know her? A. She was sent to me in the street by my young man or my son - I do not know which.</p>
               <p>Q. Who do you mean by your young man? A. A young man I sent to her - he was a stranger to me; my son sent the young man to fetch her out, but I do not know who he was.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken of a person by the title of your young man, who do you call your young man? A. My son is my young man, and he sent this young man - I objected to his going into any house to her, and he sent a young man, but I call my son my young man - my son was not present at both the conversations; I do not know that he knew Austin; he was to find somebody that knew her to send her to me - he left me to find the person.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, what passed at your first conversation with Austin? A. I asked what she knew of it - she said,"Nothing at all;" that is all that passed - she repeated the same thing each time; she said she was not present at the transaction, and therefore could say nothing, for she knew nothing; I did not have much conversation with her - I did not suppose she was going to swear my son's life away - the first conversation was a few days before the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Then in a few days you walked from Brompton to Tothill-fields to see her again? A. I did, and the same conversation passed - I asked what she knew of the transaction; she said, "Nothing at all;" she was not present, and therefore could say nothing, for she saw nothing - she said both times that she was asleep in the cook-shop; I was not present when she was before the Justice - I did not tell the Justice that she was swearing false, for she had said she knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the Justice examine any body for your son? A. No - there were only two witnesses examined; I was only at the second examination.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH HOWARD. I am a girl of the town. I was in conversation with the prisoner at the cook-shop on the night this happened; the Policeman came there, and I went out - I did not see the Policeman stabbed; I saw the staff in the Policeman's hand - he was speaking to me at that time; he made no charge against me when he took me out of the shop - the prisoner asked what he took me for; I then saw him draw his staff across the prisoner's face - I afterwards saw him on the opposite side of the way, and he hallooed out that he was stabbed - I never saw Austin there at all.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You knew the prisoner very well at the time of this transaction? A. Yes - we were not living together then; we have not lived together for two years - we had met that night at Knightsbridge, and then went to a public-house; he had several half-pints of ale - we then came to the cook-shop, and had something to eat; Phillips came in, and said he wanted to speak to me - the prisoner asked what he wanted me for; he said he only wanted to speak to me outside the door - I did not go out then, and he came in again; the prisoner had said if he had any thing to say he was to say it within; Phillips came in again, and called me - I went out then; the prisoner came out, and asked what he wanted me for, and then they had some words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he lay his hands on you to prevent your going? A. No, he never touched me - he did not put out his arms; I never heard the prosecutor say, "Take care, or you will break the windows," nor any thing of the kind; the Policeman made no charge against me - he spoke to me civilly; I crossed over with him - he wanted me concerning a half-sovereign that was given to me by mistake for 6d.; the prisoner came across directly afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. When was it the prosecutor pulled out his staff? A. Opposite the cook-shop - it was after we crossed; I did not see him touch the prisoner's face with it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean in drawing out his staff he crossed the man's face? A. Yes; he did not strike, nor did I hear him threaten - I saw no blows struck on either side; I went some distance off.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you hear any thing of the Policeman being stabbed? A. He said, "They have done me! they have done me at last! I am stabbed!" that was about five minutes after I had began to walk down the street - I mean it was a very little while; I dare say it was a quarter of an hour after the staff had been produced- I do not suppose the transaction lasted half an hour altogether; I did not go away when he said he was stabbed - there were several people near when he called out, both men and women; I have not seen any of them here - several came out to see what was going on; none of them went to assist him: the Policeman drew his staff across his face, so (drawing her hand across her own face, close to her eyes.)</p>

In April last I belonged to the Alfred barge, which laid in the West India docks; the prisoner was a boy on board the same vessel, and had a brother on board - on the 26th of April I saw him and his brother fighting; his father was a mariner on board the barge, but was not on board at that time - I interfered and parted his brother and him twice; they were fighting both times in the cabin - when I parted them the second time I took the prisoner away; I held him in the cabin, and told his brother to go on deck - the prisoner struggled, but I held him till his brother went on deck; I then released him, and he took up a quart pot to heave at me, or hit me with it - I took it from him- he then took up a poker, and said he would knock my brains out with it; I took the poker from him, and then he said he would go on deck and chuck the young b - r overboard - his brother is five or six years younger than him; I told him he should not go on deck to throw his brother overboard - he said he would be b - gg - red if he would not; he was going to pull me out of the scuttle down into the cabin to go on deck - I pushed him from me down the ladder into the cabin to prevent his going; he did not fall in the cabin - he sat down - he had offered to fight me before this; I said I would fight him if he would go on shore, but I would not fight on board - he struck me when he offered to fight, but I did not strike him again, but held him down in the cabin; his brother was in the cabin at that time - it was before I had separated them, and before he attempted to throw the pot at me, or strike me with the poker.</p>

               <p>Q. Then this happened when you were parting them the second time; after the brother had gone on deck you let the prisoner go? A. Yes, and then he wanted to go up to throw his brother overboard; I stood in the scuttle, and said,"Jack, you shan't" - he wanted to pull me out, but I pushed him down into the cabin; he sat there a minute, then pulled out his knife, and said, "You b - y b - r, I will cut your guts out" - he got the knife out of his pocket, and opened it; he struck at me, and I fell on the locker in the cabin - he kept hitting at me; I held up my feet to defend my body from the knife - I kept him off with my feet; I jumped up and caught hold of his left hand instead of the right - he caught hold of me and stuck me in the thigh, just above the knee, and after stabbing me in the thigh he had the knife up ready to hit me with it; I caught hold of the hand which held the knife, and held him till he was secured - he only struck me once with the knife; I drew the knife up through his hand till I got it - I did not cut his hand in so doing; the Policeman came in then, and took him - a doctor was fetched; the officer has the knife.</p>

I am one of the Thames Police-officers, I went on board the Alfred barge; I went into the cabin. found the prosecutor lying on the locker, and the prisoner standing very near him - the knife was then in the hands of some other person; there were several in the barge -I asked for the knife; it was handed to me - I asked the prisoner if that was the knife he had done it with; he said, Yes, it was - I did not make him either threat or promise; I said, "Is it possible you have been stabbing with this knife?" he said, "Yes, I did" - there was a medical gentleman there who had just done the wound up; it was not bleeding then - the medical man is not here - the prosecutor was sent to the hospital by his direction; I asked the prisoner if he was using the knife for any purpose, or if he had opened it on purpose to stab him with - he said he had opened it on purpose.</p>

               <p>Q.Were these expressions uttered loud enough for persons round to hear? A.

                        targets="t18310630-14-off71 t18310630-14-crimeloc74"/>, going from Holborn: when I saw him flourishing the knife at me, and making use of expressions, I pulled out my staff, made an advance towards the prisoner, and he made a step or two towards me; I help my staff up in front of me, nearly to my breast, not quite perpendicularly - I went towards him, and made a catch at his right hand, which had the knife in it, with my left hand; he made a kind of feint with his right hand, and I missed it - he immediately threw his left arm round my neck, and made a thrust at me; he struck me with his right hand, and I received the principal wound in my left breast - he made a second stab. which did not penetrate my body, but cut my clothes through on the same side of my person; I then disengaged myself from him, and in so doing we both crossed over to the opposite side, I endeavouring to secure him, and at the same time I received another stab on my right side - I believe I then struck him over the head with my staff, which is the only time I recollect striking him; I never struck him till after I received the first stab in my breast - the second stab I received about the time I struck the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you speak from your recollection of that, or are you certain you had not struck him before you received the first stab? A. I am quite confident of it - I had not offered to strike him before I received the first stab; I had done nothing more than holding my staff in my own defence, as I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time the third stab was made you both got on the other side of the way? A. I call that the second stab; I do not call that a stab which only cut my clothes - when I received the second stab in my side, I was endeavouring to secure him, but finding my force of no avail I cried Murder! and tried to make my escape from him; I extricated myself from him, and went towards Holborn - he then pursued me; he over-ran me, and stabbed me in the back as he ran by me - I might have got ten or twelve yards at that time; the knife entered my back - I still kept running to the end of Holborn; I staggered across Holborn, and recollect seeing him make his escape - he ran down Holborn towards Gray's Inn: I fell in Holborn from the loss of blood and being faint - I was confined five weeks and two days in St. Bartholomew's hospital; I still feel the effects of it, and always shall do so. I am afraid - the prisoner appeared quite sober, and knew what he was doing; he walked as well as I could myself every time I met him that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Where did you live at that time? A.In Cromet-street, near Judd-street; I should have come off duty at nine o'clock - I have known the prisoner more than a year.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you always have him in custody at your own complaint, or the complaint of other people? A. The first time was at the complaint of his wife and youngest son, the other times were at my own complaint; I believe his wife sits in the street with oranges and fruit.</p>

               <p>Q.Did you on the day this happened call him an old cuckold? A. I did not, nor tell him I knew as much of his wife as he did; I never told him any thing of the kind, nor to that effect - I never called him an old cockold.</p>
               <p>Q. And all the three or four times he abused you, you never used any offensive language to him? A. I never did; when he was on the opposite side of the way, with the knife in his hand, he said if I came near him he would do for me - he once made a complaint to the Commissioners about me; it might be about three months before this happened - I do not know the date; he told me afterwards he should complain again when I met him in Red Lionsquare, and said I should not stay there long.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.Was any inquiry made by the Commissioners? A. Yes; he was down there with me, and the complaint was heard - I was continued in the Police.</p>
               <p>FRANCIS COX. I live in Red Lion-street, Holborn - my father is a printer and bookbinder. On the 22nd of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was at my father's door, and saw Fuller pass down the street, towards Holborn - he walked down as far as Mr. Kettle's, the bookseller's shop, which is the first door out of Holborn, and looked at the books: he was on the same side of the way as I was - I then saw the prisoner come down from Holborn, on the opposite side of the way, on the left hand side, coming from Holborn - he began stamping and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300022"/>swearing at Fuller; I do not remember what he said -Fuller turned round to him, and walked over towards him- the prisoner kept going up Red Lion-street, towards the Foundling, still stamping and swearing, and Fuller following him; the prisoner then walked a little further on, and jumped into the road, saying "Catch me if you can," and at that instant the prisoner pulled out his knife -Fuller, when he saw the knife, went towards him, pulling his staff out of his pocket - then the prisoner made a stab at him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what Fuller did with his staff? A. No- he went to catch hold of him, and after the prisoner made a stab at him he hit him over the hat - I could not tell whether the stab reached him or not; Fuller did not make any blow at the prisoner before that stab was made.</p>
               <p>Q.Which hand did the Policeman use when he tried to catch hold of his knife? A. He put his left-hand out to the prisoner, they then closed, and the prisoner had his left arm across the Policeman's back, and with his right hand he was stabbing him in the side - I did not see how many times he stabbed him; fuller then got away on the pavement, on the other side of the way - I was still on the right-hand side of the street, going from Holborn; when they got on the pavement they were fighting, and Fuller cried Murder! he got away, and ran down the middle of the street, towards Holborn - the prisoner followed him, and just as they got down close by Holborn, the prisoner stabbed him in the back; Fuller crossed Holborn - the prisoner then ran down Holborn, towards Featherstone-buildings, and there two men got hold of him, one took hold of each arm; he was carrying the knife in his hand - a man struck him.</p>
               <p>Q.Before he was stopped in Featherstone-buildings, did you observe any body try to stop him? A. No, we all got out of his way - he was secured, and then I went home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How many people were there about the spot when the Policeman took the staff from his pocket? A. I saw a few there, but not many.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he walking away when the prosecutor followed him? A. Yes, he was walking on, and kept stamping and swearing - I did not hear the Policeman tell him to go away.</p>
               <p>Q. He might have gone away if Fuller had not followed him? A.No; directly he saw the Policeman he began stamping and swearing at him - he walked on; they were face to face - the prisoner was jumping backwards; Fuller did not take his staff out till he saw the knife - he then went with his left hand to catch hold of the prisoner; the prisoner made a stab at Fuller before he struck him - I am sure the blow was not given at the same instant: he stabbed at him with the knife - he aimed towards his body, and then the Policeman struck at him; I did not state to the Magistrate that the first thing done was the Policeman's striking the prisoner on the head - the prisoner held the knife so (holding his hand out) and stabbed under; the Policeman did not strike at the same time as he went to seize the knife - the prisoner's head was bleeding as he laid in Featherstone-buildings, after he was stopped; I did not see him bleed while he was engaged with the Policeman.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know of his receiving any injury to draw blood while he was engaged with the Policeman? A. No, I do not know one way or the other.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Where did the man strike the prisoner when he was stopped? A. On the forehead, and knocked him down.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q.Where did the Policeman strike the prisoner? A. On the crown of his hat - he did not touch his face with the staff at that time; I stood nearly behind the prisoner, but not quite - I was within a yard of him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were you within a yard of him at the time you saw the prisoner making the first stab at him? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I was on duty in the Holborn division on the 22nd of April - I came up after this happened, and saw the prisoner running down towards Brownlow-street; I saw him stopped by Plume the officer - I did not see him struck by any body; I assisted to secure him, and when we picked him up, he said,"I hope the b - y b - r is dead;" he said he went home on purpose to sharpen a knife to do for him, and said, "If I am committed and tried for him I shall die happy, for now I have had my revenge, for he called me an old cuckold;" I only heard him use that expression once going along - he had been drinking, but was sober enough to know what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did any body hear these expressions besides yourself? A.Not that I know of - I had hold of his arm at the time, leading him to the watch-house; Plume, the officer, had hold of his right side, but people were coming round him so that Plume was engaged in keeping peace and quietness - the prisoner was speaking to me all the way along very softly, very quietly; I paid every attention to what he said - I stated all this conversation at Hatton-garden; I did not see him struck in Featherstone-buildings, but I know he had been struck - I saw his head bleeding in front, but do not know who struck him.</p>
               <p>Q. Let us have the expressions again? A. He hoped the b - y b - r was dead; that he went home on purpose to sharpen the knife to do for him, and if he was committed and tried for it he should die happy, for now he had had his revenge, for he called him an old cuckold.</p>
               <p>HENRY PLUME. I am a Police-constable. I was in Holborn on the 22nd of April, about seven o'clock in the evening, but not on duty - I saw Fuller running up Red Lion-street; he crossed Holborn, put his hand to his side, and said, "Oh!" I did not know he was stabbed - I directly after turned my head, and saw the prisoner running up on the left-hand side of Red Lion-street, with a knife in his hand - he turned the corner, and ran directly towards Featherstone-buildings; I was at that time at the corner of Red Lion-street, the opposite corner to that he came round - I pursued him, and attempted to take him, but he held the knife up to me in this manner, (over his head); I jumped off the pavement into the road, and seeing me going from him he turned his head and ran again - I immediately turned on him, and seized him by the arm; I saw Taylor strike him over the forehead with something - the blow produced blood; I had not noticed any blood on the prisoner's face before that blow was struck - other persons came up, and he was secured; I saw the knife fall from his hand when I seized him, and I have it here, (producing a shoemaker's knife) - it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300023"/>bloody at that time; I went with him to the watch-house, and at the watch-house I heard him say, "I hope the b - r is dead, and I shall be hung, and I shall die happy;" he said that Fuller had laid with his wife, using a much coarser phrase, and he used similar expressions while going to the watch-house, to the same effect - I have had the prisoner in my custody before this; I never heard him say any thing with respect to Fuller before - he had been drinking, but not so as not to know what he was about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Were there several people at the watch-house at the time he used these expressions? A. Yes, seven or eight - he spoke in a loud tone; Riley was there - Riley and I had led him to the watch-house; I did not hear him say any thing to Riley on the road to the watch-house - I mean I did not hear him address Riley, but what he said he hallooed out in the street in a loud tone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any disturbance among the people which rendered it necessary that you should keep them off? A. There was a great mob following us, but I held the prisoner - they did not press on us; I had to push one or two that were rather in my way walking along - all the prisoner said going along was said in a loud and angry tone.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that all you heard him say was in a loud and angry tone? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BAKER. I am a Policeman, and was on duty in Theobald's-road. I saw Fuller at the corner of Lamb's Conduit-street, about half-past two o'clock - I spoke a few words with him; the prisoner came on the opposite side of the road, and walked over to the corner of Red Lion-street - he turned round, placed his back againt the post facing me, stamping with his feet, shaking his fist at us, and saying he should be hung for those two blue devils yet; Fuller afterwards turned up Red Lion-street - the prisoner followed him up that street as far as Princes-street, then stopped, and came back to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What was he doing when he followed Fuller? A. Nothing that I saw - he was out of my hearing; he then came back to me, and asked if I knew his son - I said I did not; he said a little boy had got the key of his shop, and he wanted to go to work - I gave him no answer; he said, "I mean to let them know it;" that is what he said when he turned from me - I do not know what he meant; I still kept him in sight till half-past three o'clock, because he kept on my beat, but he said nothing to me - I saw him again about four, at the corner of Red Lion-street; he stamped his feet, shook his fist in the same manner, and said he would be hung for those two blue devils yet - Fuller was then on the opposite side with me; he then returned down Theobald's-road to his wife, who sat with a stall at the corner of Great James-street, and Bedford-row - I lost sight of him then till five o'clock, and then saw him at the corner of Lamb's Conduit-street; he said nothing to me - he took a key from his little boy, and went away towards his shop; I saw him again at half-past six, in Theobald's-road - I do not know where he lives; he was coming from Gray's Inn towards Red Lion-street, between Bedford-row and Gray's Inn-lane - after passing me about three rods, he said, "I will stab the long b - r the first opportunity," and turning round, he said, "And you too if you don't mind;" Fuller was not present then - this was near Gray's Inn; he went over to his wife's stall, had a few words with her, and then went away - I followed him to the extent of my bear, which ends in Kingsgate-street; I do not know whether he observed me - I left him in Kingsgate-street, about five or ten minutes before seven o'clock; he stood stock still when I left him - he had been going in a direction towards St. Giles'; I left him at the upper end of Kingsgate-street, next Theobald's-road - I saw him at Hattongarden the next day, and there he said he hoped he had killed the long b - r, and then he should die happy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is "Blue devils" the expression usually used to Policemen? A. I cannot tell, I never heard it before - I do not think Fuller heard the expression; he was standing with his back towards me, and about a stride from me - what he said at Hatton-garden was in the room before he went before the Magistrate; there were some people there, but not a great many - I do not know any body else who heard it; I was sitting close by the side of him - he spoke inwardly, so that I could hear, as I sat by his side.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM TAYLOR. I am a smith, and live in Red Lion-street. I saw the prisoner come into Red Lion-street a little after seven o'clock in the evening - I was standing at my door, which is four or five doors out of Holborn, on the left-hand side from Holborn; I saw the prisoner coming up the street, and as he got about opposite the butcher's shop, three or four doors from me, he ran into the road, in a kind of flustering attitude - I did not particularly notice him then, till the Policeman crossed into the road towards him, and when he got opposite to me, he (the prisoner) pulled a knife out; I heard him calling the prosecutor a blue b - r, or a black b - r, or something, when he took the knife out: he said, "I have been looking for you a long time, you b - r, and I will give it to you now;" he had the knife in his hand at that time, holding it out towards him, and said, "If you come near me I will stick you;" the Policeman then went towards him, and whether the Policeman struck him before he stabbed him, I do not know, for when I saw the knife in his hand jabbing at him, it gave me such a turn that I ran into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then directly you saw the stabbing begin, you ran into your own house? A. Yes, to get something to assist the Policeman - I armed myself with the poker, and when I came out the Policeman was running down the street, and the prisoner after him; I did not see him do any thing to the Policeman during the pursuit - they had got nearly to the end of the street; the prisoner turned round the corner - I followed, and took him at the end of Featherstone-buildings; I made a blow at him with the poker - I will not say whether I struck him on the head or shoulder, but I believe on the shoulder; the blow did not knock him down - he was stopped at the time by a person in a brown coat, who turned out to be a Policeman; the prisoner's face was towards me when I struck him - I did not observe any blood on his face before I struck him, but cannot say whether there was or not; he bled profusely afterwards, when we brought him into Holborn, to tie his hands.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.How far was Fuller from the prisoner when you first saw him? A. I suppose he was full the length of one of the houses, eighteen or twenty feet - he was following the prisoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300024"/>Q. When the prisoner went into the road he went up to him? A. He did not go up to him, for the prisoner ran faster than Fuller; he got up to him beyond my door - the prisoner was running from him till he got the knife into his hand; I was three or four yards from them when he had the knife in his hand; I saw the staff in Fuller's hand, and saw him strike, which struck first I will not say - I saw a boy in Holborn. I do not know his name; there were several people about when the prisoner used those expressions - I do not know whether the boy was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner use that expression immediately before Fuller advanced to him, and when he had the knife in his hand? A. It was; he said, "I have been looking for you a long time, &amp;c.," immediately before Fuller advanced to him - after coming out with the poker, I ran after the prisoner from my shop to the end of Red Lion-street, and to Featherstone-buildings; I might have lost sight of him just in turning the corner - I did not see him strike Fuller after I came out with the poker; I think I struck the prisoner on the right shoulder.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q.When this expression was used, was the prisoner standing still, or moving on? A. He was advancing towards the Policeman, having the knife in his hand.</p>

            . I am a surgeon of St. Bartholomew's hospital. I attended the prosecutor on the night he arrived in the hospital; he had a recently inflicted incised penetrated wound on the left side, between the fourth and fifth ribs, near the breast-bone - he had a similar wound in the integaments of the chest, on the left side, lower down, and a slight wound in the skin on the back of his chest, on the back of his shoulder - that was a slight wound; those were all the wounds which I noticed; this knife would be likely to produce such wounds - the first wound in the breast-bone was a very dangerous wound: he was about six weeks under my care - I conclude that that wound penetrated the lungs; I considered his life in danger from that wound - I could not pronounce him out of danger for a fortnight or three weeks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.How many other wounds were there? A. Two; I did not consider either of them dangerous - the one on the back was very slight - that could do no great bodily harm.</p>

            . I am a bookseller, and live at No. 3, Red Lion-street, three doors from Holborn, on the righthand side. About seven o'clock in the evening, I was outside my door, and observed Fuller a little below my house towards Holborn - the prisoner was on the same side of the way; my notice was attracted by seeing what I supposed was a tipsy man crossing the road, with a kind of shout or halloo - when he got on the other side he began shouting out in a kind of frantic way: Fuller followed him a little distance, keeping perhaps a dozen yards from him; I heard the prisoner call him a b - y b - r, and several names of that kind; he kept prancing backwards, or sideways - Fuller still followed, keeping about the same distance - he then said he would fight the b - y Police, he would fight the whole of them, he would take the whole body; by this time he had got a little below Mr. Taylor's house - he then crossed over to my side of the way; he was abusing the Policeman, and when he got on my side of the way he halted, and still kept on the same abusive language - a mob began to collect; I saw Fuller pull out his staff, merely, as I thought to keep him at bay.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you notice at that time whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand? A. Not at that time, to the best of my knowledge - I was looking more at the Policeman at that time than at the prisoner; directly the prisoner saw the staff he put his hand into his pocket, and pulled something out; he then advanced into the middle of the road, and the light shone on the knife - he held it in his right hand, held it out, and said, "Come on now, you b - r, I will fight you;" he advanced to the Policeman in the middle of the road, from the pavement - he was exactly in the middle of the road when he used the expression; the road may be twelve yards wide - the Policeman was on the pavement: he advanced half way across the road to the Policeman, and struck out his right foot in the attitude of defiance, daring him to come on - the Policeman advanced to him then, and struck him over the head, at arm's length, keeping his chest open - the prisoner attempted to stab as fast as he could.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say positively whether the prisoner stabbed or attempted to stab before the blow was struck? A. No, I believe the Policeman struck him first, but he was daring him to come on; the prisoner kept attempting to stab as fast as be could - they came to a struggle, and fell; I afterwards found the Policeman stabbed - I did not see the wound given, though I saw the prisoner attempt to stab him several times: his hat fell off, and he ran - he turned his back, and ran towards Holborn; the prisoner followed him as close as he could, and when he came by the public-house door he made a thrust at his back with the knife.</p>

               <p>HENRY BROKENSHIR. I live at Mount Pleasant, and am a clerk. I was passing down Holborn about seven o'clock, and saw the prisoner annoying Fuller just at the corner of Red Lion-street, in Holborn - I cannot recollect the expressions he used, but they were very violent; the prisoner went down Red Lion-street, and Fuller also - the prisoner was on the right-hand side of the way, going from Holborn; previous to that Fuller had made several feints, as if to pursue him - I did not hear Fuller say any thing; the prisoner passed over towards Fuller, and Fuller drew his staff; I cannot say whether the prisoner had any thing in his hand when he crossed over towards Fuller- I saw him come quite close to him; Fuller struck him on the head with a staff.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see whether the prisoner attempted to do any thing to Fuller before he struck him? A. No - I did not see the prisoner strike any blow before Fuller struck him; I was about twenty-five or thirty yards from them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.After the prisoner had been struck did you see him then do any thing? A. Yes - I did not see him put his hand into his pocket, or take any thing out; I saw him make two thrusts at the Policeman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see whether either of those thrusts took effect? A. They took effect, for the Policeman appeared faint when he ran away, but I cannot say even that the prisoner had a knife in his hand.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you see the prisoner's head broken from the blow with the staff? A. Yes, it was bleeding from the wound in the forehead.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. When did you see him bleeding?<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300025"/>A. Not till I saw him captured and laying down; I have no reason to believe his head was broken from the blow, except from seeing it bleed after he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have lived nine years within two hundred yards of Hatton-garden office, and was never there in my life till this Policeman put a hand on me, through my wife, and what happened between them I cannot tell; the first time he attacked me I never said a word - he came up, and said, "I want you;" I said,"What charge have you?" he said, "I will tell you directly;" I said, "I won't go unless somebody gives charge of me;" I said, "I work for several houses in the neighbourhood, and every gentleman knows me;" he would not let me know the charge, but took me to the watch-house, and took 1s. 6d. from me - I never saw that money again; he took me before the Magistrate, and charged me with being disorderly in the street - the Magistrate asked if any body gave me in charge; he said "No - he struck me in the breast;" I was locked up, and had to get bail - in a month or two after wards I was in the street, and he took me again - I live about twenty yards from Lamb's Conduit-street; I was waiting there for a pair of shoes to mend - when he saw me he attacked me that day about complaining to the commissioners: after I had made the complaint I went with my wife to a public-house, about six o'clock one morning - he and a lot of Policeman were there drinking gin, and we had some; he said, "We are having a parting drop here, as we are going to leave the district, old woman: I know this old fellow," (calling me an old b - r); he said, "I know this old fellow is glad of it;" I said, "I don't care where you are going, if you let me alone;" a month or two afterwards my wife and I had some words - she said, "Police, come and take him;" he dragged me to the watch-house every time he chose and locked me up, and after taking me another time I was in the office yard waiting for my business, a serjeant was with him, and he said, "There's an old cuckold, I have his wife whenever I like; I know her well, and now I have buried my wife, I will keep her for a week, and then turn her up;" my little girl was by at the time; when I was taken before the Magistrate he asked what I had been doing - he said I was disorderly; the Magistrate said, "You have charges constantly against this man;" the officer said, "Your Worship. he is quite an innocent man, but takes a little drop of drink now and then;" the Magistrate said, "Well, discharge him" - this man saying he had buried his wife, and would have mine when he chose, I came home and broke my wife's stall, out of passion, then went to Mr. Mayne, the commissioner, who took down my complaint, and desired me to come at eleven o'clock the next morning - this man was there before me; I was outside in the hall - I was taken in, and not Mr. Mayne but some gentleman heard me; I told him he was constantly annoying me, and calling me a cuckold - I was ashamed of hearing the language before my children; I was turned out, and that was all the satisfaction I got - when I got back as far as Charing-cross he ran after me, and said,"You old cuckold, I will serve you out; if I can do nothing else I will swear you broke a window;" I told two or three neighbours of it, and begged him not to disgrace my children - one Saturday night, about a month after I made this complaint, I came out to go to a public-house, in Lamb's Conduit-passage - I had nothing on but my shirt; my waistcoat and coat were off - he caught me rapping at the public-house door; he said, "I have you, old fellow, and will be revenged on you;" he would not take me home, but took me round into Bloomsbury-square; another Policeman came behind me, and knocked me down - I declare it is as true as the Bible; I was looked up that night - I said, "Do you want to kill me?" for they all kicked me about - I got some bread and cheese in the morning, and next day, on my going up, he said to one Policeman, "You charge him, and I will swear to him;" they both swore against me, and said, I struck him in the breast - the Magistrate said, "Fine him 20s., or lock him up for a month;" the money was made up between my son and myself - I came out of prison, and about a week after he said, "Oh, you are out again, I will have you in again;" and when he met me he said, "Oh, you old cuckold, I will serve you out for going before the commissioners;" I said nothing to him - I came down to Jones', in the King's-road, and was talking to a young man; a ballad was being sung in the street, and he began to cough at me - I said, "It is a shame to persecute a man like me in that manner;" he said, "I know more than you are aware of; I will stick to you" - when he caught me alone he began langhing at me; I went to St. Giles' watch-house, and told the serjeants - they said, "Come up to-morrow night, and complain to the commissioner;" I went to the commissioner's room, and said, "I have been getting my living in the neighbourhood for nine years, but I must quit the place on account of this man, and I can bring a character from the neighbours;" the superintendent said, "I am bothered with you and Fuller, I would not believe you on your oath:" he took me in charge whenever he liked, and one morning in Lamb's Conduit-street, I saw him coming, and ran away - and on this day I was waiting to get something to eat, and he began laughing at me, about three o'clock; I believe I had had a glass or two of gin, and afterwards I was buying two pairs of upper leathers - when I got somedrink; I pawned the upper leathers, and have the duplicates to produce - I was coming home that night, and had 9d. in my pocket to get my supper; he met me, and said, "You are a cuckold, your wife was out last night," and that made me vexed - we began to jaw each other; I saw his staff, and ran away from him as fast as I could - he pursued me, gave me that stroke, cut me, and broke my hat - here is the cut he gave me, and the stroke of the staff; I staggered, and do not know what happened afterwards - I declare, as true as God is in Heaven, this is true - he said my wife made him take me at first, I know nothing about that; I do not know what is his reason for it at all.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FULLER here produced his clothes, which were bloody, particularly the shirt.</p>
               <p>STEPHEN ROADWAY. I am a horse-keeper, at the George and Blue Boar. On the evening the Policeman was wounded I was coming home - I live in Eagle-street; it was as near five minutes after seven o'clock as possible; I was carrying three stone bottles - I saw the Policeman and prisoner together in Red Lion-street; there was a crowd round them - when I first entered the street they were jawing, but I could not hear what they said; I walked on as fast as I could. and just as I got up within<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300026"/>twenty yards, the prosecutor pulled out his stick, and hit the prisoner over the head.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time had the prisoner struck him? A. I had seen no blow - the prisoner struck him again, and in stopping the blow to defend himself, knocked his hat off; the prisoner hit him three or four times after that - he resented it with his fist, as I thought; I saw no knife in his hand - I was about five yards from him; I heard the prosecutor give a screech - I did not hear him cry Murder! I then went on with my bottles, as a crowd gathered.</p>
               <p>JAMES HUTCHINSON. I am a carpenter, and live at No. 20. Devonshire-street, Queen-square. I was at the corner of Red Lion-street on the 22nd of April, about seven o'clock, and saw two men standing talking, one of them had a leather apron on, the other was a Policeman - I do not know what they were talking about, but there was a Policeman came and took him by the arm, spun him round, and said, "Go along with you;" the man turned round, and resented it, and the Policeman gave him a second push, and said, "Go along with you, you d - d old cuckold;" with that the man turned round, and resented it again - he d - d him and said, "What do you mean by calling me a d - d old cuckold?" the Policeman laughed in his face, gave him a push, told him to go along, and said he could always get a good natured woman like his wife at any time, and laughed in the man's face - I never saw either of them before; a scuffle ensued between them - the Policeman pulled out his staff, struck the man over the head several times, knocked his hat off, and blood came from his ear, I believe - I saw the blood.</p>

               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Did you go to the Police-office? A. No - two Policemen wished me to go, but I told them I did not like to interfere; Fuller did not wish me to go - he was not there; there was a stoutish man near Red Lionsquare, wished me to go, and a man who is now in the passage, wished me to go - I said I did not wish to go, as I had nothing to say in his favour, for he certainly insulted the man first; I did not wish to mix myself up with the transaction - I said that was my reason.</p>
               <p>Q. In which direction were you going - were you going down Holborn, or Red Lion-street? A.Red Lion-street; I first saw them in Red Lion-street, near Holborn; the man who was talking to him was on the same side of the way - that was another man, and then the Policeman came up - that was the beginning of it, to the best of my knowledge, at least it is what I saw - I did not hear the prisoner use any abusive language till after the prosecutor struck him- I did not hear him speak to him; I was only just going up at the moment the Policeman came up; they both used bad language - the man was irritated; before any blow was struck I heard the prisoner say, "D - n you, what do you call me an old cuckold for?" - there were so many words passed, I do not know what; I am sure the Policeman said he was an old cuckold - he was then within a yard and a half of me; I am sure Fuller is the man who used that expression, but he was not dressed as he is now - I saw two woman, and a man with two jugs there; I cannot say whether the man with the jugs was there when he called him a cuckold; I should think there were one hundred people there in the course of five minutes; I do not know any of them - I did not see the prisoner after he was taken into custody - the blood was about his forehead; his hat fell off, and with lifting up his arm the Policeman stuck, and I believe both their hats came off.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you quite sure you saw blood on his head in Red Lion-street? A. Why, I can almost take my oath of it.</p>
               <p>Q.Almost take your oath? A. Well, I am sure of it then; I can take my oath of it conscientiously - I meant to say I dare take my oath.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The Policeman asked you to go to Hatton-garden; you said you could say nothing in the Policeman's favour, for the man had been used ill - did they afterwards send a summons for you to come? A. No - two men came to my house, but I did not see them; and who they came from I do not know.</p>
               <p>JAMES SULLIVAN. I am in the employ of Mr. Perry, who keeps a public-house in Red Lion-street; I know Fuller - before the day on which he was stabbed I heard him call the prisoner an old Irish cuckold; the prisoner was not by at the time - I do not know where he was; I once saw him disputing with the prisoner, who was standing near a post - he said, "Go on, Irish," and,"There is an old cuckold;" the prisoner could hear that, I have no doubt - Fuller came to our house next morning, and was talking to our bar-maid; he said what he had done yesterday, and what a row he had with the Irish thief - he said if he had an opportunity he would knock him down with his staff, and that he insulted him first; I said, "No, you insulted him first."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long was this before the 22nd of April? A. About three weeks.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. What is the name of the bar-maid? A. I do not know - she has left; some more Policemen were there at the time - when Fuller used these words in the street, the prisoner was on the opposite side of the way.</p>
               <p>JOHN BYRNE. I am a journeyman boot and shoemaker, and live in Smith's-court, Brewer-street. I have known the prisoner from his infancy - he is a good hearted humane man as ever I met with in my life; I know he was in the habit of carrying a shoemaker's knife about seven years ago; he used to take it backwards and forwards to his house to cut his soles with - on the morning of the 22nd of April, between seven and eight o'clock, I met him and a young man coming from his stall; I asked him for some money which he owed me - he said he had some shoes to make, and to-morrow he would pay me; he showed me some leather he was going to cut, and he had the knife also - he went to a currier's shop; I met him coming out, rolling up some upper leathers - he said,"Now, if you have any money treat, and I will pay you altogether;" we went into a public-house, and had two pots of ale, which I paid for - I saw the blade of the knife coming out of his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>JAMES LOWE. I am a currier and leather-cutter. I have known the prisoner seven years - he dealt with me; he always appeared mild and agreeable - about seven o'clock on this morning he came to my shop, and cut part of his leather, which he had bought the night before; I supplied him with a knife, or he used one of his own, I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOWELLS. I know the prisoner. On the morning of the 22nd of April, about seven o'clock, or halfpast, I saw him with this knife in his possession going to the leather-cutters; I was with him nearly the whole day - he had the knife with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300027"/>MR. BODKIN. Q. How late in the day did you see him with the knife? A. I left him at half-past twelve o'clock, and returned to him again at three, when he was looking after his son for the key; I did not see him get the key from his son - he did not go to his stall while I was with him; I left him after the accident happened - I was walking on a few paces, and saw what took place.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Who struck the first blow? A. Mr. Fuller - I suppose I was fourteen or fifteen feet off; he had not his knife out at that time, to my knowledge - he very frequently carried the knife about with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carry the knife about to cut old boots and shoes with.</p>
               <p>CHARLES KETTLE re-examined. I was about twenty - five yards from him when I saw him strike.</p>
               <p>Five other witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

On Saturday night, the 14th of May, between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner came to our shop, or it might be later; I knew him before - he said he came for change for a cheque for 6l. 6s. for his master or mistress, I do not know which - he said that without my asking him who it was for; he produced a cheque to me, which I afterwards gave to the officer - this is it (looking at one); I told him the name was not spelt as I had seen it spelt before - he said, "The reason you think that is, because you never make the bill out in the right way;" I gave him six sovereigns and six shillings - I had repeatedly given him change for cheques for Mr. or Mrs. Fonblongue; he was in their service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Then you knew him to live with Mr. fonblongue? A. Yes - I am sure that when I remarked about the spelling he did not say he knew nothing about it, as he got it from the cook; he said it came from his master or mistress, but in the hurry of business I cannot say which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not come to you afterwards with his father, when he heard there was something said about the cheque? A. He came with a Police-constable - he came with his father on the Friday night; Mr. Fonblongue and all were present - he was not in custody; I did not say if his father made up the money nothing would be said about it - I said nothing of the kind, and never heard it said; I understood the father offered to do it - they went away about their business; I am sure he did not tell me that he got it from Elizabeth Barrett - the only remark he made to me was, that I did not make the bills out properly; we live three quarters of a mile from Mr. Fonblongue, but he dealt at our shop.</p>
               <p>ABANY FONBLONGUE. The prisoner was in my service for three months, and quitted on the 16th of May; I think he had warning about a fortnight before, and was to quit on the 16th, when his three months were up, as I was dissatisfied with him - (looking at a cheque) this is not my hand-writing; I did not send him to get change for it - I have frequently sent him with small cheques, as I give Mrs. Fonblongue a cheque every week for current expences -I may have sent him seven or eight times with cheques, and on those occasions he brought the money to me, or generally to my wife; on Saturday, the 14th of May, about three o'clock, I sent him with a cheque for four guineas -I have my cheque-book here with the margin on it; I have entered here, "14th May, Mrs. Fonblongue, 4l. 4s., No. 85;" I have occasionally left my cheque-book out, and I recollect that it was left out on the Saturday, for I took it off the dining-room mantel-piece to write this cheque - I find there is a leaf torn out very close to the binding; I discovered that on the morning of the 21st, the day after this forgery was made known to me - the cheque uttered is No. 86 - I have seen the prisoner's hand-writing, but never saw him write.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your lady here? A. No - my Christian name is Abany William, but I always sign my name Abany; I have dropped the William some time - I sign deeds as Abany only; I do not remember signing the name of William for many years - I have at some period of my life; the Police-officer came to me on the morning of the 23rd, stating that the prisoner had surrendered.</p>

               <p>RICHARD WILLIAMS. I am an inspector of the Police. On the 21st of May I was in Lower-street, Lisson-grove, and saw the prisoner - he said that he had come to point out a fellow-servant, who gave him a forged cheque; her name was

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He wrote it for you without the least hesitation? A. Yes; he came to me of his own accord, to assist me in apprehending the woman; it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - he met me in the street; he had been to the station-house with his mother and father.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH BARRETT. I was in Mr. Fonblongne's service at the same time as the prisoner, and left the same<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300028"/>day as he did - I was taken up by the Policeman, and discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the prisoner that cheque on the Saturday evening, to get change for your mistress? A.As I hope to see the Almighty God on his throne, a paper, black, white, or red, I never gave him; on my oath I did not give this paper to him, nor did I ever know Mr. Fonblongue write papers for money.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you never saw the cheque-book laying about? A.Never, so help me God; I used to go into the parlour at times - I cannot write, not at all.</p>
               <p>JOHN CHANNER. On the Friday night before the Monday that the prisoner left Mr. Fonblongue, he told me Mr. Fonblongue's book and cheques were laying about loose on the table - he told me this at the gate; he made no proposal to me about the cheque.</p>
               <p>Q.What led to this being told you? A. I am a pot-boy, I was bringing the beer, and he began the conversation with me; that was all he said - I was not examined before the Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Nor before the Grand Jury? A. No - he came out for the beer, and said this, but nothing more.</p>

No - as God is on his throne, I cannot write; I never forged a bill or note, and never had any thing to do with it - I cannot write, to call it writing; I suppose I make an attempt to write, but am not a writer - I never in my life wrote a letter to a friend, not with my own hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by swearing you could scribble a little, when I asked if you could write? A. I had no meaning for it - I cannot write, and never took part in the bill; any child may scribble - I cannot write, (a pen and paper were here handed to the witness, upon which she began to make a mark); I cannot write indeed - I cannot do any thing in the writing way; I did not swear I could scribble - you cross-examined me; any body can scribble - I write nothing that any body can make any hand of; I never wrote a word in my life - I do not know any thing about writing, and that is all I can say.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Charrington. On the 16th of May I went round the house, locked the garden-gate, and barred and bolted the kitchen door - the parlour doors were locked, but the keys were in; the front door was made fast. I heard no noise till Mr. Charrington came home - my mistress called me down between two and three o'clock; I found master in his bed-room: mistress thought he was murdered - I went down to the kitchen to get him a glass of water, and found the pannel of the kitchen door out, and the boots out by the kitchen door; I know this hone - I had seen it in the house on the Saturday; the boots hung in the back kitchen when I went to bed - I saw the desk the night before; it was kept in the front parlour - the Prayer-book was by the side of the desk, the coat and silk handkerchief hung in the passage; I know the silk handkerchief - this is it: I found four phosphorus-matches outside the kitchen door, and a phosphorus-box; I found them as soon as I opened the kitchen, on coming down - I know this hone and boots to be my master's.</p>
               <p>MR. CHARRINGTON. This hone is mine - this great coat, boots, and the Prayer-book are mine; the Prayerbook has my name in it; the handkerchief is my father's - I never lost sight of the man from the time he dropped over the palings till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, (written). From the evidence you have heard I am convinced you must feel satisfied that I am not the person who committed the robbery - I beg leave to state that I am a mechanic, who was returning to the arms of my family after walking many miles in search of employ in my honest avocation; that I should be seized, beat, and most unmercifully treated, then dragged to a prison, to be tried for an offence which my very soul shudders at the thought of - my principles have not deviated so far from the paths of virtue as to commit a crime so heinous in its nature; I trust the gentlemen of the Jury will consider my awful situation, and examine with attention the imbrobability of the prosecutor's evidence, for the darkness of the night in question was such, that it was impossible to see any one at ten yards distance from the place you might be in - nor was I aware that any one was coming after me, until I was collared by a powerful man, which naturally alarmed me; considering myself attacked by a robber, I tried all the resistance in my power, and struck him with something I had just picked up, which proved to be a hone, but his strengh so far exceeded mine he overpowered me, and struck me with the hone till I was quite insensible - thus my Lord, stands my situation; the desk and great coat I know nothing of - I also beg leave to state that I never was in a Court of Justice in my life, and have always heretofore been considered and known as an honest, sober, and industrious man; I therefore submit my case to the wise dictates of an omnicient God, whose more weighty influence may induce this honourable Court to deem me worthy of their mercy.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Jenkins, and live in Gloucester-buildings, Whitecross-street. On the 21st of May Sivewright called me in; I saw the prisoner behind the door, with a bundle in his hand - he said,"Don't say a word, mistress, don't say a word - I am a poor man out of work;" I said, "From where did you steal this coat?" he said, "From a shop in Bunhill-row;" he also said, "If I leave the coat I will come in the evening for it, and pay you for your trouble;" I said No, and told him to get out of the house with it - he went away.</p>
               <p>JOHN CUMMINGS. I am the witness' father. I sent my son to get a coat on Saturday, the 21st of May, from Mr. Boys, Church-court, Strand; he came back with two women, without the coat, which was new, and worth 3l. 12s.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HOOPER. I am a constable of St. Luke's. -In consequence of information I apprehended the prisoner, on Monday morning, the 13th of June, at No. 10 or 11, Playhouse-yard, Whitecross-street; I went up stairs to him, and said, "Tom, you are the man I want;" he asked me what for - I said, "For the coat;" he said he knew nothing whatever of it; he had a yellow handkerchief on at the time - I have not got it here: he called to a female in the adjoining room, to give him the handkerchief which he had lent her; she brought him a black handkerchief - he pulled the yellow one off his neck, and put a black one on; he had corderoy trousers on, and a waistcoat with sleeves - he made no resistance.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Last Monday three weeks, in the morning, I was at home - the officer came up to where I lodged; he locked the door, and said he wanted me - he took me to the office, and stated the case to the Magistrate, but I knew no more about it than a child; at the time of the robbery I was twenty-seven miles from here, at work at my trade at Bagshot - I came to town, and was taken; the witnesses have sworn they saw me take the coat from the boy in the street, but I never saw the boy before, nor these two women; I had not been in town for two months - I have got no witnesses, for I was ashamed to send for any.</p>

On the 21st of June, about half-past three o'clock in the afternoon, I went out of my room, fastened the parlour door, and went down to the kitchen - the street door was shut and fastened with a catch, but not locked; while I was in the kitchen I thought I heard a noise in the parlour - I came up quick, and saw the parlour door ajar, which I had locked; I pushed it open, and saw the prisoner in the parlour - he came towards me: I seized hold of the collar of his coat with both my hands, and asked what he did there - he said, "Let me go;" I said I would not, that he was a thief, and had robbed me - he insisted on my letting him go; I would not - I struggled with him in the passage for a minute or more, and then he tore my gown; I then called Murder! I had not then observed whether my drawers were open - he put his foot to mine, threw me down, and went out at the street door; I followed him immediately, and did not lose sight of him till he was taken by Sibley, the officer, who brought him back to my house- I then examined my drawer, which was open, and he went towards the drawer to throw a purse into it; I had lost from the drawer a brown silk purse, with a sovereign and a half in it - I had put it in there about an hour and a half before; the drawer was locked, and I had the key in my pocket; I did not see the purse in his hand till he went to throw it into the drawer - it was the same purse as I had lost; he tried to put it into the drawer, but it went into the officer's hands before it got to the drawer - when I came up stairs the street door was shut - it opened with a latch-key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.How long had you had the purse? A. About ten years; my husband is not here - he is ill: I swear that the purse is mine - I never heard that the prisoner claimed it; I have no family nor servant: I never let any body look at my purse - there is a stitch or two dropped in it, which has caused a hole, and it is changed into different clours; I was single when I married Mr. Hall - I was only seventeen years old: I was never married to a Mr. Holmes - I do not know such a person.</p>

I searched him, and found a chisel put up his coat sleeve - I took him back to the house, searched him again, and saw a brown silk purse in his hand; I saw him heave it towards the drawer - I caught it in my hand, and the prosecutrix identified it; it contained a sovereign and a half - he threw a handkerchief away, which I lifted up, and found a key; I tried it to the parlour door, and it fitted it - I found on him a bag, with a latch-key, and that opened the street door; a boy gave me a key, which he said he found in the street.</p>

On the 21st of May I lost my money out of my box - I do not know the date, but it was about six weeks ago; it was on the Saturday before I went to the Police-office the box was broke open; there was a little box in it, containing five sovereigns and two half-sovereigns; the prisoner had been taking care of the room from Monday till Saturday - she went away at twelve o'clock on Saturday, and I missed my money between twelve and one, within an hour of her leaving - I had seen my money on the Thursday morning; the box was locked, and I had the key - I had not been to it since the Thursday; the little box was taken away, as well as the money - there was nothing in it but the sovereigns and half-sovereigns; I did not see the prisoner again till Monday, when she was in custody at Marylebone-office - the Policeman showed me my money; she had been taken on the Saturday.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and had a room in Cragan's house; the prosecutrix, another woman, and I and my wife lodged in that room - there are two beds in it. On Saturday, the 21st of May, the prosecutrix told me of her loss - I went with one Maloney in pursuit of the prisoner as far as Brentford, getting into Hounslow - John Carr, the officer, was with me, and he took her; I saw her searched - five sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and 7s. 4 1/2d. were found upon her - she had the sovereigns and half-sovereigns in a little tin box, but not the other money - as we came along she said, "I don't know what is to become of me now about this here money;" I did not threaten or promise her any thing - I said I did not know what would become of her, but she had behaved rather foolish to have any thing to do with the money; she said nothing more to me.</p>
               <p>Q.How came you to pursue her? A. She had left the house at twelve o'clock - I understood she was going into the country again - she had been with me from the Monday morning till the Saturday, as a servant, and slept in my room; I had hired her by the week, which would not be up until the Monday - she left of her own accord, and did not let me know she was going.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable of the Kensington division. I was on duty at Brentford on the 21st of May, and saw Pickley running through the streets at Brentford, in his shirt-sleeves, about ten minutes after six o'clock in the afternoon, another man was with him - he was coming in a direction from town; I went, and asked him what was the matter - he said a woman had robbed him of six sovereigns; in consequence of his information I followed the prisoner, and took her going into Hounslow, about two miles and a half from where I first saw Pickley - I laid my hand on the prisoner, told her I had ran far enough after her, and that she was my prisoner - I brought her into a public-house to search her; she took this tin box out of her pocket, and thought to conceal it; I caught it in her hand, took it from her, opened it, and found in it five sovereigns, two half-sovereigns, and two rings - Pickley was present, and when he saw the sovereigns turned out he said, "That is the money;" she was present, but said nothing - I brought her to Brentford, kept her there till the 23rd, and then brought her to Marylebone-office; Pickley walked with her from Hounslow, but I did not hear what passed between them - I beard him say to Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, that she took 6l. from this woman; I did not see that taken down - this ribbon and two rings were in the box.</p>

Graham said No, and Jackman denied having received it - she made use of the most out of the way sort of oaths, and swore I had not; I said, "Well, ma'am, I will wish you good night, keep the money, and I will go away, and say no more about it;" I attempted to go away, and told

             I should stop no longer - Jackman had a candle in her hand; Gray was standing there, and at the time I made to  go to the door Hyams stood there - she came up and said,"Oh, you cannot go, Sir;" I said, "What have I done? what do you detain me for?" and Jackman immediately blew out the candle - before she blew out the candle she had her left hand on my collar, pushing me back, and the other two women held me hard - I attempted to go down stairs, but Jackman never let go of my collar, and struck me a violent blow in the eye; I received several blows - she is the only woman who struck me, but the other women scraped at me - they all of them fastened on my collar, pulled my coat over my shoulders, scratched my face, and held my throat; the blood came down in torrents from every part of my face - I attempted to get down stairs all I could, but I could not get their hands off my collar; I screamed out Murder! and dragged myself down backwards - Jackman was holding me by the collar with one hand all the time, and striking me as hard as she could, like a man - with great difficulty I got down; Hyams and Jackman stuck to me particularly till I got down to the landing - when I got down to the first floor landing I saw a reflection of light from a room; I looked about as well I could, and saw three men coming up - they began pushing me, beating me about the head, and asking me what I did there - I was screaming Murder and Robbery! all the time - when the men came behind my back I found Jackman's hand in my pocket - the men came behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find Jackman's hand in your pocket before the men came up, or after? A. She attempted it before, but after the men came up I caught her hand in my pocket- I held it, and cried out Murder! - she tore my waistcoat from my back in getting out her hand, and got my money out of my pocket; my waistcoat pocket was turned inside out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any of the men? A. To the best of my knowledge, Hayward struck me on the lip as I came down; after screaming for a considerable time at the door, calling Murder and Robbery! and knocking and kicking at the door, and they using very sort of language to me, the door was opened, as if by magic, and I got out into the street; I found I had lost all the silver in my pocket - I had about 21s., in shillings and sixpences, loose in my pocket when I went into the house; I know that twenty minutes before I had 21s. - I afterwards found a Policeman, and gave him information; he returned with me to the house immediately, and I pointed out the persons who had robbed me - the prisoners were taken into custody immediately in the house; they were sitting in the kitchen, quite composed, as if nothing had happened - they were all four there, with another young man, but the Magistrate let him go, as I considered he was not one of them; I had given 2s. for the bed, and 5 1/2d. for the ale, and when I met Gray I treated her with a glass of port; Gray hallooed out Robbery and Murder! and took my part as well as she could- I had thirty-eight sovereigns wrapped in a piece of newspaper in my watch-pocket; I did not lose them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You were quite sober and collected? A. I consider so - I have brought my waistcoat here on purpose to show the Judge and Jury- I am gate-keeper at one of the East India warehouses now; I am not married - business had called me out; I believe Gray to be a respectable person in the character she was - I do not know the sign of the house where we had the glass of port; I did not treat myself with any thing - it was perhaps a hundred yards from the house; it was a public-house - I did not sit down; I paid 4d. for the port.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say you were robbed of the thirtyeight sovereigns? A. I did - I never swore it; I put my hand to all my pockets, (and in the deranged state of mind that I was in, I was all blood, and could scarcely see out of my eyes - I felt round all my pockets,) where I am in the habit of keeping money, and could find none; I told the Policeman I had lost both silver and gold - he asked how many sovereigns I had lost; I said I had thirty-eight, not that I was robbed of thirty-eight - I did not swear positively to the male prisoner at the office, and I do not now- I swore to the best of my knowledge; I was in such a deranged state; I did not know but I was stuck with a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Might you not then be mistaken about the man? A. No - the man came and met me about three stairs high, struck me behind, and when I called Murder! Jackman struck me in the lip; I was beat and scratched by the women, and nearly choked before the men came behind me- by the reflection of the light on the stairs, Hayward is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the people endeavouring to keep you in the house till you paid 2s. for the trouble you had given them? A. I paid 2s., and treated her with half-and-half.</p>
               <p>Q. Now did you mention a word of the quantity of silver you had lost till a sum of silver was found on one of them? A. The sovereigns which I thought I had lost absorbed my mind, for they were only entrusted to me; I said I had lost all the silver and gold I had - I did not hear what silver was found on the prisoner; I said I had lost 18s. or 18s. 6d., or something there about - I stated that when I went before the Magistrate, but I told the Policeman I had lost all the silver and gold I had; it was the sovereigns that were my greatest trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300034"/>Q. The sovereigns in your fob would make a pretty good bulk; did you not feel them? A. I put my hands all round, and never till three o'clock, when I got home, and threw my trousers down, did I find that the sovereigns were still in my fob - I did not feel them before; you must consider that the blood was flowing from my wounds - I did not swear to the man who was discharged as being one of them; when the Policeman called next morning, I said,"There are my sovereigns, thank God! I don't care about the rest - I have lost 18s. or 18s. 6d.;" they had not searched me at the station-house at night - I left the station about twenty-five minutes after the robbery, and stated that they had robbed me of all my silver and gold.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you a watch about you? A. No, nor any pocket-book; I had a pocket-handkerchief, which was not lost - I was leaving Gray behind me at first; I told her I should go - they were preventing my going down stairs.</p>

             GRAY. I met the prosecutor on the night of the 26th of June, and went with him to this house - he was not intoxicated; I had been there before, and knew Mrs. Jackman - I have seen Hayward at the house - he lives there; we went up stairs - Graham followed us up; I told her we wanted a bed for the night, if she would take 2s.; she said she would go down, and ask her mistress - the prosecutor pulled out a handfull of silver, and gave her two sixpences and a shilling; she brought the 2s. up again, and gave it to him - Mrs. Jackman came up; I said, "Mrs. Jackman, won't you take 2s. for the bed?" she said, "Yes, I did not know it was you, or I would have taken it at first;" the prosecutor gave her 5 1/2d. to get a pint of half-and-half, and gave her 2s. again for the bed- he gave it to Jackman; Graham was gone out then -Jackman went and fetched a pint of half-and-half; we all drank of it - she put the bottom sheet on the bed, and said,"Has the gentleman given you any thing?" I said,"Never mind that, if he has not, he will;" the gentleman then said, "I shall not stop here;" Jackman said, "You have not paid for the bed yet, Sir;" he said he had, but she was welcome to the 2s., he should not stop at all - she called up the servant, and said, "Graham has this gentleman paid you for the bed?" Graham said, "No, ma'am, he has not," and then two girls came into the room - one of them took the gentleman by the collar, and said, "Why do'nt you pay for the bed?" he said, "I have paid it - you let me go;" the candle was then either put out or knocked out, I do not know which; Mrs. Jackman and they together, pulled the gentleman down stairs, and I was left there in the dark by myself - when they got nearly to the bottom of the stairs, I looked down, and there were three men there as well as the women: at the time the prosecutor paid the 2s. to Jackman, he pulled all his money out in his hand - I cannot form a judgment how much there was; it was silver - I did not see any half-crowns among it; I could not distinguish the men at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen the prosecutor before? A. Never; nothing was said about what he was to give me - we went to a public-house at the corner of Fann-street, where I had a glass of port, which he paid 4d. or 5d. for; I never saw his gold - we did not sit down in the public-house; I do not know the name of it - I had met him about a quarter of an hour; I do not know the time exactly - I did not stop long enough to see who the men were on the stairs; I never said there were but two men - I was fetched to the station about six o'clock in the morning; Mrs. Jackman told them where to find me, and desired I should be sent for.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. About ten minutes before two o'clock, on the morning of the 26th of June, the prosecutor met me in Goswell-street - he was in a dreadful state, bleeding from his eye-brows completely all down his front; his waistcoat was torn all down - I did not notice whether the pocket was turned out; he told me he had been with a young woman, and the parties in the house had robbed him of all he had - I accompanied him to the house, knocked at the door, and Jackman opened it; I went in, and called the prosecutor to follow me - I said, "Now point out which is the person who robbed you;" he pointed to Jackman, and said, "That is the person who blew out the candle and began the attack, and the others aided and assisted;" he pointed out Hayward among the rest - he said he had thirty-eight sovereigns, and had been robbed of the whole that he had; I called my fellow-servant while I went up stairs to search, and when I came down I took them all to the station.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you swear that McFarlin said positively that Hayward was one of the parties? A. I do positively - I was at the office when he was sworn; he said there, to the best of his knowledge, Hayward was one - he said no more at the station; I mean to say that he pointed him out - in the agitated state he was in he said he was the man, but when he came to himself, he said to the best of his knowledge; he was standing by in the station-house when they were being searched - I searched Graham and Hyams, and found nothing; he was present when Jackman was searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mention any particular sum that he had lost in silver till she was searched? A. No, he did not - I cannot say whether he saw what silver was found on her; he might be about two yards off - there was a light; there was 18s. 11 1/2d. found on Jackman - it was handed to the inspector, but not to the prosecutor; it was handed to the inspector, who counted it - the prosecutor was not actually near enough to see what it was; he was within two yards - I mean to say it could be done without his seeing what it was; it was handed between the rails to the inspector-I did not search the prosecutor; I cannot say how long he staid there, because I returned to search the house - we never search prosecutors.</p>

            . I am a Policeman, and assisted Jones. The prisoners were all taken into custody; I asked Jackman who did it - she hesitated, and said she did not know; I said it was impossible for her not to know who did it, and who brought him to the house - she said Country Polly brought him there; I asked where she lived; she said somewhere in Playhouse-yard - she said Graham knew a little about it; I said, "Well, I shall take you all to the station;" I searched her pocket, which was behind her, and found 18s. 11 1/2d. - the prosecutor said at the station that he had been robbed of thirty-eight sovereigns, but he spoke in that flurried way I could hardly hear how many he said; I heard nothing of silver till we were at the Police-office on the Monday - I considered they were charged with stealing the sovereigns.</p>

On Sunday, the 5th of June, exactly at a quarter to two o'clock, we went out; I locked the two bed-room doors - the back door was bolted; I double locked the outside door myself, and put the key into my pocket; I returned about nine o'clock, alone - I found a crowd about the door, and the house broken open; I went in at the door, and found a private watchman inside - I found a great deal of property taken away from different rooms, and the drawers all pulled about; I lost about 30l. worth of goods, and have got none of them back - I never saw the prisoner till the day of the robbery; I saw him standing about my door about half an hour before I went out, talking to another man - I am certain he is one of them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.How long was the prisoner standing there? A. I saw him there about half an hour before I went out - I said two men were standing there, and I did not like the looks of them; they stood there talking and picking their finger nails - I was in this Court some years ago, but cannot tell when, for I am no scholar; I cannot tell how many years ago it is; I was tried and sent to the hulks at Sheerness for six years - I was discharged on the 4th of April in some year.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you ever seen him before? A.

            . I am apprentice to Mr. Rogers, a jeweller. I was walking with my brother by this house about four o'clock in the afternoon, and saw the prisoner, in company with another man, running up the Shepherdesswalk - the prisoner was carrying a blue bag, and the other had a bundle in a handkerchief; I walked between them some steps - it was raining; the prisoner said, "I can't put up the umbrella, I can't go so fast;" they were just upon the run - the other said to him, "Never mind, run on, we have not far to go;" I turned round, and saw Taylor the officer running - I ran also, and saw the prisoner taken into custody, but he had no property then; I am quite certain of his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q.There was no pursuit after him when you first saw him? A. Yes; I, my brother, and the officer followed him, but it was on account of suspicion from what I heard them say - there was no hue and cry after them then; he just turned down the street, he returned in about three minutes without any thing, and was taken - he was walking back, and the persons who had pursued him were waiting at the top of the street, to see if they could learn what house he had gone into with the property.</p>

            . I am a headborough. On the Sunday in question I saw the prisoner about noon, alone - I saw him again about half-past four o'clock, in Edward-street, in company with a respectably dressed man; the prisoner had a blue bag on his back - the other man had a bundle under his arm: I thought it was not altogether right - he got to the corner, turned round, looked back, and then ran; I followed, and lost sight of him, saw him again, and lost sight of him again - I ran to the end of New Hoxton, and saw them between Allerton-street and Union-street, and when I got there I saw nobody; I turned round in five minutes, and saw the prisoner in Hoxton New-town - I went up; Richards said, "That is the man who robbed the house - I will swear to him;" he was wiping his face, and was in a perspiration.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there no means of his getting out of that street without coming back? A. He must go through houses if he did - there are gardens at the end of the street, but they are always locked; people belonging to them have private keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the first examination he said he saw me two hundred yards from him, and at the next examination he said it was four hundred. Witness. I always said it was two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About a quarter-past five o'clock on the Sunday in question, I left home for the purpose of getting my wife some medicine, she being extremely ill, and near her confinement - I was passing the corner of the street, and observed a number of people collected, and on getting towards them I heard Richards say, "Come back, for they have not gone this way;" on my getting near to Richards, Taylor turned round, and said, "I think you are the person who committed the robbery, and I must take you;" I went to the station without hesitation. I respectfully submit to you, is it likely if I had been the person that I should have gone down the street, get out of sight, and then come back into the arms of the persons in active pursuit of me, which I must have known? and now, my Lord, if there is any discrepancy in the evidence, I trust you will give me the benefit of it.</p>
               <p>One witness gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

I thought something was wrong, and ran away too - I went into the house, and put the rings down, as I saw my companion was not honest - I recommend myself to the mercy of the Court.</p>

My boy and man stated so, I believe; I did not see the other boy - I said two came, as they said they saw two; I never said I picked the case up - I took it out of the prisoner's hand; Wych-street is a very little way from my shop - there was a Jew arm-in-arm with him, and they both made their flight; I told the Magistrate I saw the Jew - I saw the two boys at a public-house in Holywell-street, where the prisoner ran to, and I seized him; I had no opportunity of seizing the boys, as the Police did not come in time for me to take them; I held the prisoner fast, and he went into the public-house with me - the boys ran away; before I could well see them they were out of sight - they were the same description of boys as were in the shop, and the prisoner took me to them for the purpose of getting the rings; he said, "I will get your rings," and took me in there; I mentioned this at Bow-street - I am positive he said he would take me to where I could get my rings back; I am positive of that - a bag was found on the prisoner, which the Police call a swag bag.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Have you got the case here? A. Yes, my Lord; I am positive it is the case - it has never been out of my possession since I took it from him - I have had it about six months; I took him three or four hundred yards from my house - I never spoke to the boys either in my shop, or elsewhere.</p>

            . I am fourteen years old - I have lived with the prosecutor about eighteen months. On the 16th of May, about half-past four o'clock, I remember the prisoner coming to inquire about engraving a ring; I never saw him before - I was cleaning a ring at the counter; there were fifteen altogether on the counter in a case - the prisoner was about four yards from me- a boy came in about a minute before him, and another came in just at the same time as the prisoner, and that boy asked me the way to Oxford-street; I stood where I was, pointed over the way, and said it was somewhere over there - he went out; the boy who came in first wanted 1d. worth of watch-springs - I knelt down behind the counter to get them out of the drawer, and before I gave him the watch-springs the prisoner went out, after Mr. Binns had given him his answer; immediately after the other boy went, I turned round to clean the rest of the rings, and they were gone - I had seen them just before the boy came in for the watch-springs; I had emptied them all out of the case, and put them back as I cleaned them - I had put them all back but two; on missing them I told Mr. Binns directly - he put on his hat, and went out; I went out also, but could not see them -I saw the prisoner at Bow-street afterwards, and am quite confident of him; he was not above three or four minutes in the shop - I have not seen the boys since; I am quite confident neither of them could reach the case - this is the case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Both the boys came to you for what they wanted, and the prisoner, if he is the person, went to your master? A. Yes - master was sitting at the board next to me, working behind the counter, close to the window - we have only one counter; I was about the middle of it - the prisoner did not speak to me.</p>
               <p>Q.Nor come to your end of the counter? A. That I do not know, for I turned round to Mr. Binns to ask how many springs I should give the boy, and turned my back to the prisoner then; my master sat with his face to the window, and his back to the top of the counter - his side face was to the counter; he turned round to give him an answer - he sat at the workboard, and I at the counter lower down, near the back part of the shop; the prisoner stood about the middle of us - I turned my back to the end of the counter, and to the rings, when I asked how many springs I was to sell; the prisoner was not in conversation with master at that time - the prisoner and the boys were all about the same place; one of the boys had gone away - the other is about fifteen years old; there was a show-glass on the counter, and the counter is about a yard and a quarter wide, which he would have to reach over - I tried myself to see if the boy could reach the case, and it was impossible; the two rings which remained out of the case were left, only the thirteen were taken - I did not go into Wych-street after him; I have not said I was not quite sure of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the prisoner near enough to reach the rings? A. Yes - he had been looking into the glasscase, and if he put his hand over he could take them; the case was exactly opposite to me, but the boy asking for the springs drew my attention from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300039"/>WILLIAM FLEGG. I am a watch-maker, and work for Mr. Binns. I was at work in the shop, within two yards of Jones - a boy came in and asked for 1d. worth of watch-springs; there was nobody else there then, but almost at the moment he entered, the prisoner came in, and inquired of Mr. Binns the price of engraving a motto on a mourning-ring - he told him 2s.; Jones came to Mr. Binns, asked how many springs he should give for 1d., and the prisoner left the shop the moment after - I had seen the lad cleaning the case of rings a moment before; the prisoner was within a yard of it - the boy missed them directly: I saw Mr. Binns pick a diamond ring off the floor behind the counter - it was one which had been in the case; I do not know how it came on the floor - I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Bow-street; I am sure he is the man, for he went out of the shop, looked at the goods in the window, and then walked off- I had a full opportunity of identifying him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your attention was not directed to what was going forward? A. Not particularly - my back was to the case of rings, but I was within a yard of it; I turned round once or twice, and could see the prisoner.</p>

               <p>JOSEPH SWAINSON. I am an officer. I searched the prisoner at the watch-house - he said he knew nothing of the 5s. piece; I went back and found it among the tares behind the counter.</p>

            . I am foreman to Edmund Pontifex and others. On the 19th of May Mr. Pontifex came from Mr. Betts', and I sent for Corby, who came - the prisoners were employed at our manufactory, repairing a drain; they left at six o'clock, and I observed that Rudd had something under his jacket - I was in conversation with him a long time, and when he was gone I told the gate-keeper, who followed him; I saw Rudd join Mullins, who had gone away while I was talking to Rudd - they joined company on Holborn-bridge; I and Corby followed them to the corner of Smithfield together, and there Rudd stopped; Mullins went on towards an old house, next door but one to Mr. Betts', at Smithfield-bars, but I did not see him go in - I continued to watch Rudd - I passed him while he stood at the corner of Smithfield; he then turned round, and went towards the old house - I crossed over to the other side, and lost sight of him while he passed a waggon - I afterwards saw him standing at the corner of the old house; I think he must have seen me, for he appeared confused, and almost immediately Mr. Betts brought Mullins out by the collar - Mullins had a bag in his hand; I then went up to Rudd, and told him he had something about him which he had not honestly come by - he said he was very much astonished I should suspect him; I told him we suspected him of taking property out of our manufactory, but if he would go into Betts' distillery he might be searched, which would not expose him so much - I do not think he made any reply; Corby then took him into the distillery - I saw nine pieces of copper, and I think four pieces of brass found under his jacket, on the left side, except a small piece or two, which was in his coat pocket; I saw five pieces of copper found in Mullins' bag; it was different sorts of copper - it is impossible to say what that found on Rudd was formed of; I cannot say whether I had seen it on our premises, we have so much of the same sort; I can identify one or two pieces, and some which were taken from Rudd - I asked Rudd what he had done it for; he said he knew he had done a bad job for himself - I asked where he got it; he said he had dug part of it out of the old drain, and he hoped Mr. Pontifex would consider his wife and family - the copper found on Rudd weighed 6 lbs. 12 ozs. and the brass 2 lbs. 14ozs. - on Mullins we found 12 lbs. 6 ozs. of copper.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he say where the old drain was? A. No - I did not examine the old house to see if there was a drain there; I cannot say whether I stated at Guildhall that he said it was a bad job - I said I could identify some of the copper, and pointed out a pattern which it was cast from: I identified some, and said there was more found on Mullins, which very likely I might fit to the place it was cut from - the officer took it home with me; I did not see Mullins with a bag before he went into the old house - he had a pole on his shoulder, I had instructions to see where he went, as we suspected he took metal to this old house; I was in hopes of detecting the receiver.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the trouble to see if there was any body in the old house? A. No; there were persons on the watch - I was not near enough to Mullins to see if he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300041"/>was bulky; the copper is not a common pattern - these are for making screws for pumps; we have made hundreds from it, but never sold any of them - they are constantly being used, and re-cast: this will be a screw when finished.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Were the prisoners at all concerned in the copper manufactory? A. No, they are bricklayers - we sell by retail, but not this sort of material.</p>

            . My father is a distiller, and lives at Smithfield-bars - he has an old house near his premises, going under a repair. On the 19th of May I discovered something in that house, and sent for Mr. Pontifex - I watched the old house that day, from about six o'clock, and saw two persons come into the house - there was a boy standing before me, so that I could not see where they both went, but I saw Mullins come out of the cellar with a bag in his hand - I seized him when he got near the door; he trembled, and said "Pray let me go, I will never do so again;" I said, "You are done" - I took him into the distillery; I emptied his bag, which had copper in it - I had seen that copper in a cupboard in the old house, between nine and eleven o'clock that morning, and in consequence of that sent to Mr. Pontifex.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. For what you know, somebody might have put it there, and told this man to go and get it? A. It might be so - I never saw him take copper in there; we keep a French brandy distillery.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. Were the prisoners at all employed at the old house? A.They had been at work there some time.</p>

            . I went with Sharpe, and followed the prisoners - I received Rudd into custody, took him to the manufactory, searched him, and found this metal on him -I saw the bag, which was found on Mullins; Rudd said he had dug part of the copper out of the drain.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the distance from the prosecutors' to the old house? A. I could walk there in three or four minutes - I followed them from Holbornbridge to the house.</p>

            . I live in Brewer's-yard, near the Bell, Smithfield, and am in Mr. Betts' employ. On the 18th of May I went into the old house, and found the copper in one corner of the cellar - I told the painter of it; I heard a noise in the cellar on the night of the 18th - I went down, and Mullins came out of the cellar door with his arms out, pretending to frighten me; he went away, and bid me good night - both of them did: Rudd was there, but not in the cellar - I went up stairs, and in five or ten minutes I heard a noise again; I came down, and Mullins came out of the cellar door again - I and the painter went into the cellar next day, brought the copper out, and locked it in a closet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How could they get it then? A. My young master took it out of the closet, and put it in the same place again in the cellar - I saw no copper nor bag about Mullins; the copper was not covered in the cellar, it could be seen with a light - I had no candle when I saw him; he saw me, and spoke to me - the painter worked there after the bricklayers had done; I saw Mullins bring the copper out of the cellar in a bag on the 19th - the prisoners had been working there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. Was the bricklayers' work done before the 18th? A. Yes - neither of them had any business there on the 19th that I am aware of; other bricklayers were also at work there about a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Rudd's Defence. There were several workmen at Betts' besides me, two bricklayers, a carpenter, and two painters; we took some scaffolding from Pontifex's to Betts', as Mr. Betts had given me leave to put it there - I went there for nothing but to take the scaffolding.</p>
               <p>MR. BETTS. I had not given leave for scaffolding to be put there; I do not know whether my father had.</p>
               <p>The prisoners received a good character.</p>

No; he dealt in clothes and haberdashery - I knew him for twenty years, and was six years in his employ; I was in his parlour when the prisoner was taken into custody - the prisoner is a raw country lad, and has been but a short time in town; I have heard he has fallen into the hands of a woman of bad character.</p>

Yes, I recollect it; I saw Rees write his name in a book, and afterwards on this paper - what was done on this paper was in the absence of the prisoner; I cannot recollect whether this paper was read in the prisoner's presence.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you sign the paper? A. Yes; I believe the prisoner was there at the time, but I cannot exactly speak to that fact - I cannot positively swear that this paper was read in the prisoner's hearing; the evidence was first taken in a book.</p>

Bank of England notes, and, I believe, seventeen or eighteen shillings in change, but I had taken five shillings from it before I counted it, to give to the person who brought it to me - the prisoner is one of the person who were behind me in a state of some confusion when I turned round; the other ran by me towards Soho-square, and the prisoner towards the Haymarket - I followed the prisoner in preference, from a particular circumstance, and cried Stop thief! - while I was running a person called, "Here is your purse;" I, supposing it was the prisoner's confederate, continued to pursue him, till the purse was delivered to me - I then gave up the pursuit and lost sight of the prisoner - I went into Mr. Hamlet's shop, and was brushing myself, when the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300044"/>officer came in and took me to an office, where I saw the prisoner; this was in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - I believe it is called Mr. Baker's office; I had been purchasing some goods in a shop near Regent-street, in Piccadilly - I there put my purse into my pocket and walked on to Princes-street - when I turned the second time in Princes-street, I saw a sort of shuffling between the prisoner and the other man's hands; I pursued the prisoner from this circumstance - while I was speaking to my mother's coachman, at the shop door in Piccadilly, a person passed by me very close, who I at first thought was the servant, but seeing he was not, I did not notice him particularly, but when I turned in Princes-street, the impression on my mind was, that the prisoner was that person, which was my reason for pursuing him: the first time I turned in Princes-street, they both stopped when I did; I then felt my pocket, and turned again - they separated, commenced running, and I followed the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you swear positively to the prisoner at the office? A. Yes, as positively as I could - I spoke with a perfect conviction that he was the person; I think that was taken down, and I signed it - but I am really so unused to these things, that I do not know; the impression on my mind is, that I did sign it - I think I did, but I do not wish to swear to any thing I am not certain of; what I swore was read over to me; but I am in some confusion, as I went to two offices - what was read to me was at Marlborough-street, but I think what I signed was at the other office - my only doubt is at which office; I am positive the deposition was read over to me, and that I signed it, and in that I identified the prisoner - I believe that was taken down; I have evidence that it was taken - it appeared to me that that was what I had stated; all that I stated was correet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you quite sure that you stated at the office that you believed the prisoner to be the person who brushed by you? A.When I went into the office the prisoner came up with great violence, and said, "Do you mean to say it was me?" I said, "Stop, stop! this room is dark, let me see you in the light;" he was then taken out into the light, and I said, unhesitatingly, "That is the man I pursued," and I had a vague impression that he was the person who brushed by me.</p>

            . I am a servant; I did live in Poland-street. I was in company with Thomas Lee on the 30th of May - I saw the prisoner running down Princes-street, and the prosecutor pursuing him; I saw the prisoner throw something into a gig, which was standing in the street, opposite Mr. Hamlet's door - I went to the gig, and found on the rug a purse, which I gave to Mr. Hyndman, in the same state as I found it; the prisoner was pursued some distance further, and was then taken - I am quite clear he threw something into the gig, and I found nothing in it but the purse.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did the prisoner stop to throw the purse into the gig? A. No, Sir - I am quite sure I did not throw it there myself; I was not about to leave town - I never stated so; I was not going to Scotland or Liverpool- I lived as servant with a Mr. Wallis two years ago; I have since then been in the Police for about six months - they would not keep me any longer; I was too found of drink, that was the only reason - no thieves got off through me; the commissioners did not charge me with that - I had been drunk once or twice; I was reported once or twice - I cannot say how often I had been drunk; the prisoner told me where his father and mother lived, and I went to them - I dined and drank tea with them; I did not coax them out of any cash.</p>
               <p>Q. Be careful, I have witnesses here, I tell you? A. I did get 1 1/2d., but not from them; it was on the table - the prisoner's wife told me to take it up - she wanted to speak to me, and told me to come to her down Holborn; I said I would go home, and get shaved - she said, "There is 1 1/2d., take it and go and get shaved;" I did not, at the dinner, or tea, or in the conversation with the prisoner's wife, say that the witness Lee had false-sworn himself from beginning to end, nor anything of the kind - there were persons at dinner and tea with us; the dinner was then ready, and I took some - I drank some beer and some gin; Lee was in the Police, but he has resigned of his own accord - he told me so; after I gave the prosecutor his purse, he gave me 5s. - I did not ask him for money.</p>
               <p>MR. HYNDMAN. He did not ask me for any money at the time he gave me the purse, but he afterwards called at my house, and said he wished to see me particularly - I met him afterwards in London; he said he wished to go out of town, and if he was obliged to go who would pay his expences.</p>
               <p>JAMES LEE. I am a porter at present - I have been in the Police, but left it on the 21st of March. On the 30th of May I was near Mr. Hamlet's shop: I saw the prisoner running down the street, in front of the mob - he went up to an empty gig, and threw something into it; he was running - he inclined to the left, and threw something into the gig; Mr. Hyndman was in pursuit of him at the time; Bean and I went up to the gig - Bean took the purse out in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Whose porter are you? A. Mr. Downing's, the floor-cloth manufacturer, in King's-road, Chelsea - I have been there a fortnight; I was out of employ when this happened, and had been so nearly three months - I formerly belonged to the Life Guards, and I have a pension of 6d. a day - I had drawn my quarter's pension just before this happened; I was in the Police ten months, but I had bad health - I do not know that there was any complaint made against me; there might be some frivolous things, such as being too late - there was a complaint made against me; I forget whether I was put on my defence before the commissioners - I cannot recollect what the complaint was; I will not swear there were not two complaints against me - I was only once before the commissioners; it was for quarrelling with an officer - I went to see the prisoner in Tothil-fields prison, by the request of his wife, as he was very ill and low - I do not know what I was to do; I did not ask him for money, but he offered me money to go out of the way - he said he would give me as much as I liked; I never said before any body that I would do my best to convict him - I went to the prisoner's father; they sent for me - I did not dine there, nor did Bean, in my presence; I once or twice drank some beer there - I was not going to Scotland.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you at any time suspended from your employ as a Police-officer? A. No, I resigned through bad health.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police. On the 30th of May I was in Oxenden-street, and heard a cry of Stop thief! - I went to Panton-street; it was a little after twelve o'clock in the day - the prisoner was pointed out to me, and I took him; I received this purse from Mr. Hyndman - there is now one 5l. note in it, the other was delivered to Mr. Hyndman; when I took it there were two 5l. notes, five sovereigns, and some silver in it - I searched the prisoner, and found a gold mourning-ring on his finger; a pin, and one sovereign and a half in an inside pocket, on the left of his waistcoat, and half a sovereign in his left waistcoat pocket.</p>

            . I am a house-painter, and live at No. 15, Denmark-street. I was at the prisoner's father's, in the Coal-yard, Drury-lane - I saw Bean there; there was some meat and vegetables on the table - I did not hear Bean ask the father for any money; I do not know whether Bean had been sent for - I heard the prisoner's wife say to Bean, "You know you told me that the Scotchman had foresworn himself at the Police-office;" Bean did not seem to wish to own to it, as there were other persons there - he was sitting in his chair, and moved his hand back, as if to stop her speaking; she asked Bean to come out from the father's house - I had seen him there twice; we were talking about this case, and he said he could not tell what the prisoner threw into the gig, and if he had any sort of counsel, he could get him through; he told me afterwards, that he did not like to speak in the presence of the prisoner's wife, but if she had offered him a sufficient sum of money to bear his expences, he would have gone out of town long ago - I have known the prisoner ever since he was quite a lad.</p>

Yes, many times - it is called a sarcophagus or a wine-cooler; wine-coolers are made in different shapes - here is no hole to let out the water; this would not be called a cellaret by one person in twenty who knew what it was; this is intended to be put under dining-tables and side-boards.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner; I told him Batchelor was in custody for offering a seal to pawn - he admitted that he had sent Batchelor; I asked him if he had taken any thing else - he said he had taken another: I had not made him any promise or threat; he said the other was at a cousin's of his, and I went and got it - he said they belonged to Mr. Granville, and he took them out of his room, either off the sideboard or the table.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I did not state that they belonged to Mr. Granville, nor that I took them out of his room - about three months ago I was employed at the hotel for three weeks; I then left, and lodged with Batchelor's mother, in Praed-street - about four nights afterwards I was coming across the fields, and was stopped by Avis; he said, "You are my prisoner" - I was thunder-struck; he said would I tell him the truth, it would be all the better for me, as I should be taken before a Magistrate, and by telling him the truth I should, no doubt, be acquitted; I was frightened, and said, "What am I to tell you the truth about?" he said, "You have been accused of stealing two seals from the hotel;" I said I had not - he said, "You gave them to a young man to pawn;" I said, "I gave him one seal, which I bought of a young person at Brighton, and gave him half a guinea for it;" he said no more to me, but took me before the Magistrate, and stated nearly the same as he has to-day.</p>

On the 28th of May I watched him, and saw a customer come into the shop - I was standing near the door, and he was behind the counter; just as the customer was leaving the counter I saw the prisoner draw his hand clenched from the till - I walked up to him; another customer came in, whom I told him to serve - he turned to take a canister down, and I saw part of a half-crown in his hand; he put the canister down, put his hand into it, and served 6 ozs. of tea - I then searched the paper he put it into, to see if there was a half-crown in it; there was not - I then called my other assistant, and told him to spread a sheet of paper on the counter - I emptied the tea out of the canister, and I found among it a half-crown with a black mark, which I had before put into the till - I accused the prisoner of taking it, and said I had suspected him for some time; he made no answer, but said he wished to speak to me in the parlour - we went on towards the parlour, and as we got to the door, I said "I suppose you have robbed me before?" he said, "No, not for a fortnight;" I said, "To what amount; I suppose 100l.?" he said, "No, upon my soul, not 30l. altogether;" he said there was more money in the tea - I looked, and found two more half-crowns; I then sent for a Police-constable - I marked them with a brad-awl.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long had he lived with you? A. Upwards of two years - I have given the same account as I did before the Magistrate; I think I did not then state that he said he had not robbed me for a fortnight; I did not feel disposed to do him any injury; I have not said that I should be glad to have him back - my assistant and one customer were in the shop at the time; I did not mention to the customer what I had seen - I had before sent the prisoner out for 4l. worth of silver, and then I remarked this half-crown, which has a dull sound and a black mark on it - I did not employ a Mr. Cole to draw up a warrant of attorney, nor authorize him to write to the prisoner or to his brother about his defence in this case - I did not recommend an attorney of the name of Howard, but I think Mr. Cole recommended some attorney to the prisoner's brother; I do not remember having seen this letter(looking at one) before, but I verily believe Mr. Cole wrote some letter and gave it to the prisoner's brother, for the purpose of his having a solicitor - I never authorized Mr. Cole to say, "My prosecutor, Mr. Hunter, is anxious that the prisoner should not be convicted;" in the course of his business, as a traveller, there are debts contracted; I look to him, I do not look to others for them - there are debts on my books, for which I have had a warrant of attorney signed by the prisoner's brother; I have not since then applied to the prisoner to sign a warrant - I never sent any person to say that if a sum of 50l. was paid by him I would not appear to prosecute - I never told his brother so.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is it customary for you, or any of your shopmen to put the ready money you receive into the canisters? A. By no means, my Lord.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons are in the prosecutor's employ? A. Only the prisoner and myself: I did not go into the parlour - I had no conversation with the prosecutor about this case before I gave my evidence: I had not forgotten what I had to say, and had to consult my master - I talked to my master about several things, but not about this case, nor what I was to prove; this is my hand-writing, (looking at a letter,) I went to the prisoner in prison, respecting some debts he had contracted, and neither Mr. Hunter nor myself knew where the parties lived: they were due to Mr. Hunter, but the prisoner was answerable for them; he had a commission on them - I had summoned some of the persons, in Mr. Hunter's name, in which they were contracted; I was not sent to ask the prisoner to join in a warrant of attorney - I did not hear the sum of 50l. mentioned by Mr. Hunter.</p>

               <p>MR. HUNTER. The prisoner was a shopman till the last eighteen months, and since then he has had a commission on the business - he sold to whoever he chose; I looked to him for the gross amount - he had no share in the profits, only on what he sold - when he first began he had a couple of guineas a week, but he has only served in the shop on a Saturday of late, and for that he was paid; he did not participate in the profits on a Saturday - he drank tea and supped there, if he chose to stay, and I gave him what I thought proper - he had a commission on what he sold out of doors, but he had nothing to do with that indoors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when he took the half-crown? A. I was at the post of the door - I saw him take the half-crown, and he likewise acknowledged having robbed me to pay the debt he owed me - I forgot to state that; here is the mark on this half-crown, which I had noticed particularly.</p>

            . I am the prisoner's brother, and am a house-painter. I have become responsible to the prosecutor for a debt of 66l., due from the prisoner; I signed a warrant of attorney for it since this charge was made against the prisoner - Mr. Hunter expressed a wish to Mr. Cole, his attorney, for my brother to sign the warrant while he was at the bar, and he said if it was not convenient to have it done in the office he would send his clerk down here to get it; Mr. Hunter made a proposal about going out of town; he and I went and saw the prisoner after he was locked up at Marlborough-street, and Mr. Hunter proposed to me that if he had 40l., to pay the expence of his recognizance, and 10l. to take him down to the north, he would go out of town; he said that within a few yards of his own house.</p>
               <p>MR. HUNTER re-examined. As I came from Marlborough-street his brother was very much distressed, and said what could be done - I said nothing, that I was bound in a bond of 40l., and so was my servant, and if I had so much to spare I would go out of town; I had no animosity against him, and I hear him none at the present moment.</p>

The prisoner was a stranger - I had never seen him to my knowledge till the 18th of January, when he came with a woman of the town: he came to the bar between nine and ten o'clock, I should think, and said he wished to speak to me in private - I went to the bar door; he said he wished to speak to me in private, and I then opened the door and he came into the bar - he then took a watch from his pocket, said he was in company he did not like, that he had some valuable property about him, and asked if I would take charge of it for him till the morning; I said I should have no objection if he would call for it himself in the morning, and he said he would - he then put what I supposed was a valuable watch and seals into my hand; he did not say that it was gold, but he said he had valuable property - I took it into my hand, and I thought, and still think, it was a gold watch, chain, and seals; he then asked if I would give it him back, and give him a piece of paper to wrap it in - I gave it him, and a piece of printed paper; he went into a little room adjoining the bar to wrap it in it - he then asked me for another piece of paper like that, (it was a printed circular,) I gave him another, and he said he would put that into his pocket, to produce it on the morrow, when he came for the watch - he then gave me the watch in the paper, and I put it in a little drawer which I had in the bar; he then came and said, "Mrs. Gaynor, will you oblige me with a couple of pounds, I am out for the night, and I don't think I have sufficient money with me:" I do not consider that I lent him the money on the strength of the watch, but I lent it him on the supposition that when he came for the watch he would return it to me - I certainly should not have lent the money unless the watch had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300051"/>deposited with me; he then asked for a small glass of brandy, which my sister served him with, and I was rather doubtful, and thought I ought to have looked at the watch before I lent the money: I took it out of the drawer, and stepped back into the passage to see if it was the same as he had shown me - directly I opened it I felt convinced that it was not the same; the moment the prisoner saw me take it out he was off - he went away directly; I sent in every direction, but could not find him - I found in the paper the watch which I now produce, which I do not suppose is worth 1s.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you enabled to say positively, or otherwise, whether this is the watch he first produced to you? A. It is my conviction that it is not, but upon my oath I would not say it is not - the prisoner ran quickly out of my house - I gave every information, but he was not taken till the 22nd of May.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.But for the deposit of the watch you would not have advanced the 2l.? A. No.</p>
               <p>ROBERT BANKS. I keep the Wrekin tavern, in Broad-court. On the 22nd of May the prisoner came to my house - I had known him before; he produced a watch to me -I had happened to be at Mr. Gaynor's at the time he left the watch there, and knowing that I detained him - he offered a watch to me for 1l.; I told him I never did any thing of that kind - I locked the door, and sent for Mr. and Mrs. Gaynor; the prisoner tried to go out.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If it had been a gold watch, would it have been a case of felony? I borrowed the money.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live in Corder's-court, Orchard-street. On the 24th of May, about seven o'clock in the evening I was in Orchard-street, and saw McGinnis - he had got hold of Irving with one hand when I saw him; the Policeman had got hold of Irving's right arm, and as they were staggering back I saw Irving kick McGinnis up between the legs, right in *** - it was after the Policeman had got hold of him; he kicked him again, but missed his kick that time, and his foot went up outside - the mob then broke in, and rescued him from the Policeman; I am sure McGinnis was sober; he went down to the watch-house, holding both his hands to the part where he was kicked, and said he was a dead man - I afterwards carried him in a sedan-chair to the hospital.</p>
               <p>Q. Was McGinnis holding the prisoner by the collar the first time you saw him? A. Yes - I saw no blows pass before; the prisoner is the man - I have known him sixteen or eighteen years.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you there when they fell down on the ground? A. No; I was about twenty yards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300052"/>off - I did not see him on the ground; I cannot say whether he fell down.</p>

I was on duty in Orchard-street, and heard the deceased, or somebody, call out Police! - I was a hundred yards or more from the place; I turned round, seeing people gathered - I ran to the spot as fast as I could, and found the deceased had hold of Irving by the collar; I endeavoured to separate them - McGinnis said, "Take this man into custody, I am an injured man;" I said I could not take him, in consequence of not having seen the assault committed - they still had hold of each other in a very violent manner; he again wished me to take him - I refused, as our orders were not to take any body, without seeing an assault committed; I separated them - Irving and his friends went home; McGinnis walked to the watch-house - I should suppose him to be sober; I cannot say whether the prisoner was drunk or sober - he is a shoemaker; I knew them both before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it true, that after you came up the prisoner kicked the deceased, as the man has described? A. I cannot swear that he kicked him - I was trying to separate them; the deceased had hold of the prisoner by the collar, about the breast of his jacket, not his cravat - I saw no tipsy woman about, and heard nothing about the prisoner's mother.</p>
               <p>Q.Was he not held so as to prevent his breathing? A.He spoke to me; I cannot swear whether Irving kicked him or not - Irving said, "Part him, take him away from me."</p>

            . I am house-surgeon of the hospital. I was in the accident-ward on the evening of the 24th of May, when the deceased was brought in - he in great pain, and said he had received a violent kick in the lower part of the abdomen, from a man in a quarrel; there was no external mark at the time, but he complained of great agony - he was put to bed immediately; I attended him till he died, which was between one and two o'clock in the morning, on the 30th, I think - he was examined afterwards; there was an extensive inflammation of the peritonceum, also inflammation throughout the whole course of the intestines; the stomach was much inflamed - there was also an ulceration of one of the intestines, with adhesion to the peritonoceum; the other parts of the body were healthy - the severe inflammation was the cause of his death, and that was the result of some external violence; a violent kick would certainly produce such consequences - the ulceration must have been going on some time, on account of the adhesion which was under the particular part where I understand he received the injury; a blow given shortly before he was brought in, would produce that ulceration by the time I examined it - the inflammation could not be of long standing; a kick in that part was certainly sufficient to produce death - a fall, or any violence, would do it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.If in the struggle he had fallen on some hard substance, it might have caused those appearances? A. It might - the violence was rather about the groin; I conceive the ulceration to be the result of the inflammation - if inflammation had existed before, he would have complained of pain; no inflammation could be going on without pain - I should not think him addicted to drink; the liver was healthy - he was stout, and predisposed to inflammation; such an injury would be more likely to be fatal to a stout man.</p>
               <p>JOHN TUSTIN. I had known the deceased about twelve months - he was a very hardy, strong man; I saw him two days before this - he did not complain of any thing.</p>
               <p>THOMAS BATES. The blow was made at the deceased's face by the man who said he should like to have a round with him; whether the blow struck him, I do not know - I looked for Martin, and when I turned again, I saw the man who struck the blow and McGinnis on the ground; there were about twenty people about.</p>

            . I am a constable of Croydon. On the 9th of February, 1830, I found a black mare at Russell's stables, Westminster, which Hale claimed - I went with Russell to the Obelisk stables, to apprehend the prisoner, or to learn from him where he got the mare - I did not find him there; I searched for him at a great many places for a long time, and found him in custody at Unionhall about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you ever hear of a man named Hyder? A. Yes - he was transported either in January or March, 1830.</p>

            . On the 22nd of February, 1829, the prisoner brought me a mare to sell - I then lived in Bellstreet, Westminster; I was in the habit of buying horses of him - he said he considered it would suit me, and left it with me to try; he did not say whose it was - he dealt with it as his own; I bought it of him on the 23rd. and gave him 11l. odd - he lived somewhere over by the Obe<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300053"/>lisk at that time, I think; Coleman, the officer, afterwards came to my stables with Hale, but we could not find him - I did not see him till he was at Union-hall: I showed

Very well for some years - he was known all round the neighbourhood; I found him honest and punctual - there was no concealment in this transaction; it was about three o'clock in the afternoon - I did not go to look for him at the Obelisk for nearly twelve months after; I dealt with him for about six months after I bought this mare, and could have taken him if I had known it was stolen.</p>

            . I am a butcher. I was present about the middle of last February two years, when a man(who went by the name of Wood, but) who I have no doubt was Hyder, sold the prisoner a black mare for 9l.; the prisoner had a receipt from him - I did not see the prisoner again till he was at Union-hall; I was sent for, and gave evidence there.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you keep a beer-shop? A. Yes, and keep a butcher's-shop in Alfred-terrace, Cambridge-heath-road; I came this morning from a booth at Fairlop-fair - he bought this mare at the Anchor and Hope, Devonshire-street, Lambeth; I had never seen Wood but once before - I then lived in Regent-street, Lambeth-walk - I kept a private still there - I got into trouble about that, which strengthens my recollection as to the time; I never saw Wood afterwards - I described his features and dress to those who knew Hyder, and have every reason to believe it was him; I wrote the receipt - I had known the prisoner five or six years, but not particularly: I advised him to have a receipt for the money, as the man's appearance caused my suspicion; I asked the prisoner if he knew the man - he said he had seen him before - I am not able to speak to the day, or the week, but it was shortly before I lost my still; it was on a week day - there was a good deal of cross-chopping at the office as to whether it was on a Sunday, and, to the best of my knowledge, I swore it was not; the transaction occurred in the parlour, four or five others were there - I have not seen them here to-day; they were strangers - I do not know a man named Cutts, nor his daughter; I have not been in any difficulty, except about the still - I was once in custody about four years ago, for having a 21l. bill, and charged with a conspiracy to defraud; I was only in custody one day and a night - I saw the prisoner pay for the horse a 5l. note, and the rest in sovereigns; I cannot say it was the horse in question - it was a black mare, about fourteen hands and a half high, with a cut tail; it had one white foot I know - I did not take particular notice of it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did any thing ever come of the bill? A. I went into Court, and the prosecutor refused to appear.</p>
               <p>MR. HALE. Mine was a black mare, with two white hind feet - the near fore foot was grizzle hair; it had a nag tail, and a streak of white down the face.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the Police stationed at Wandsworth. On the 7th of May the prisoners were taken into custody by Page - I saw them all at Ewer's house, and took them to Queen-square, on suspicion of Ewers' robbery: they were remanded - I then returned, and searched Lee's apartment in Ewer's house, and found in this basket five unfinished brushes, some tobacco, and a quantity of duplicates in a snuff-box - they were by the side of the bed on the floor in their room -I found another basket there, which I left at the time, as it was empty - here it is - it was brought to me by the serjeant in the course of the next week; I know it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did not Lee tell you the brushes had been left there by George Potter, a friend of his? A. He did not - he said he had purchased them: he mentioned some name - I do not swear it was not Potter; I think this conversation was at Queensquare - it was in the course of that morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Had you seen the brushes before you went to Queen-square? A. Not these, but I had seen two more, which were taken from there previously.</p>
               <p>MRS. EWERS. I saw McDonnell find these things in Lee's bed-room.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ for nine weeks; about six weeks ago I missed a ring, which was kept in a jewellery-box on a shelf in the ware-house - I cannot exactly say when I missed it; I saw it again on the 24th of May at a pawnbroker's - I knew it to be the ring I had missed; I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.How long had you had it? A.Twelve months; I swear to its being mine - I bought it of Mr. Lazarus, a manufacturer; I discharged the prisoner on the 20th of May - I did not then charge him with any thing, but I had missed things.</p>

            . I am a constable. I apprehended the prisoner on the 20th of May, at his father's, in St. John-street, charged with obtaining a watch in his master's name - Mr. Novra did not charge him with this ring then; I found a number of duplicates on him, and among them one for this ring - I said nothing to him about it; I went to Whittaker's with the prosecutor - the ring was produced, and he claimed it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On the 20th of May did the prosecutor tell you he had lost a ring? A. No; he said he had lost several articles, he could not tell what; the prisoner said the whole of the goods pawned were his own property - some were musical snuff-boxes; the prosecutor said, "It is impossible - some of them have been obtained in my name; I deal in musical-boxes - they may have been taken from my warehouse - I will go with you and see;" when I told him a ring was pawned, he said that might be his, as he dealt in jewellery.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live on Clerkenwell-green. I had a ring of this pattern in August last - it is a very common pattern, or I could speak to it more positively; I believe it is the same, but as there are many of the same pattern, I do not swear positively to it - I sold it in August; here is the book in which I entered the transaction - I cannot say to whom I sold it; the prisoner's friends applied to me about it about a month ago - I have entered here, that on the 30th of Au<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300056"/>gust I sold a ring for 7s. 6d.; the buyer's name is not entered, as it was sold in the shop - I believe it to be the ring I sold that day.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Was the ring defective in any respect? A. Not when I sold it; there is one stone out now - I must have had it above twelve months in my possession; it was out of time, and was some months in my window -I have no private mark on it.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. From the materials it is made of, is it likely one of the pearls might drop out? A. It was very likely - I made no communication to the prisoner or his friends till they applied to me.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. NOVRA. Q.Have you any private-mark on the ring? A. In the gold there is a little hole at the bottom - I did that myself; my wife wore it, and lost the pearl out of it - she gave it me to put one, and I put it into the jewel-case and forgot it; she had worn it for twelve months - I did not intend to sell it; I made the hole to try if it was gold or silver.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q.How was it you never mentioned that to the officer? A. I had not looked over my stock, and did not know I had missed it; I did not mention the mark to the officer - I only told him about the pearl; I did not try it with aqua-fortis.</p>
               <p>JURY to STEPHEN STEPHENS. Q. Did you perceive this hole in the ring when you took it in? A. No; one of the stones were deficient.</p>

            . I am a City-officer. I was in Houndsditch, and saw the prisoner with two boys; they all three turned up Bishopsgate church-yard after Mr. Turner and a gentleman; the two boys walked first and Sheen behind them - nearly opposite the church-yard they made a stop, and some man that was going on before them ran forward; I went to catch hold of Sheen and the other - Sampson, who was taken, stopped; he did not run; I saw Sheen throw the handkerchief away as he ran: it was produced, and Mr. Leach claimed it.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been to Limehouse to look for work - there was a cry of Stop thief! several boys ran round the corner; the gentleman laid hold of me, and accused me of throwing down the handkerchief; I know nothing of it.</p>

On the 21st of July the female prisoner came and took my first floor, at 7s. 6d. a week - it was furnished; she promised to come the next day to tell me where to apply for a reference - next day both the prisoners came, without any bundle; they lived there till the 11th of November - they had paid me 1l. 2s. 6d. for rent, and when they went away there was about 3l. owing; I had not seen them from the night of the 10th of November - I had repeatedly asked for my rent; the woman borrowed a cloak of mine to go to Mr. Bailey's agent, in Suffolk-street, Strand; her husband had told me that he was a lieutenant in the Navy - when she came back she told me the agent was out of town, and she had to go again early in the morning, and if I would let her have the cloak she would pay me the money early in the morning; her husband was then up stairs - he was never to be seen; he never left my house from the 21st of July till the 11th of November - he always pretended to be ill; when they were gone I missed all the articles stated in the indictment - they had all been let to them except the cloak: I missed them between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - I went up and knocked at the door, and not receiving any answer I tried to look through the key-hole, but it was filled with butter; I had repeatedly been in the apartment before, but had not missed any of the articles till that day - I saw the female prisoner on the 3rd of June, and I saw my cloak the next Tuesday at Queen-square office.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Were you good enough to offer to Mrs. Bailey the loan of your gown and bonnet also? A. She said she had not a gown and bonnet to go to the agent in, and I lent her mine on the day before, but on that day I declined lending her them, and only lent her my cloak; she was living with her husband all the time - her husband was never out.</p>

On the 13th of June I gave her into custody for being intoxicated - we could not get her to bed nor out of the house, she was so riotous and abusive; the articles stated have been produced to me by the officer, and I can swear to them - it is a particular sort of soap which washes with hard water: we send for it out of the City -I have the fellow sleeve to this one, and the ribbon and lace are what I had sold Mrs. Willder out of my own shop.</p>
               <p>GEORGE TILLEY. I am a Police-constable. On the 13th of June I was called by the prosecutor, and found the prisoner intoxicated; I went up stairs with her - she got her bonnet off the table, then unlocked a drawer, and pulled out a shawl; she locked the drawer again, and when she got to the door she said, "I have a bob in the drawer, and it is of no use to go to quod without blunt;" she then went to the drawer, and took out a purse - there was an eye-glass in it, which she took out, and was going to put it into her pocket; I took that and the purse from her, and brought them down - the prosecutor said the glass belonged to one of his children, and the purse was claimed by Mrs. Willder; I took the prisoner to the watch-house - I searched her, and found some of these articles on her; I then went to her room again - she gave me the key of her drawer to fetch a pocket-book, which had some writing in it, which she did not wish her mistress to see; I found in the drawer, this ribbon, lace, frock-body, and shoe-horn - she said her mistress desired her to put all the things laying about in the drawer.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLDER. This key is the key of the beer, which she purloined to help herself - I know these things to be ours; we had two or three of our children in that room, but the prisoner had the drawers exclusively to herself.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long defence, stated, that the prosecutrix had desired her to put any thing into the drawers which she might find laying about, and having found some of the articles she had done so; that the drawers were for the use of the children, who slept in the room, and some of the things had been given to her by the prosecutrix's daughter.</p>
               <p>MR. WILLDER. My wife did not keep her drawers locked - part of this lace is quite new.</p>

On the 15th of June the prisoner came into our shop, about eleven o'clock in the morning - he had a bag with him; another man came in afterwards, who was dressed like a Turk - the prisoner took up two 1d. loaves, and laid down a sovereign; I took out a purse or bag to give him change - I put the money into my hand to separate the silver from the sovereigns, to see if I could give him change; I had then twenty-one sovereigns and some silver in my hand - the prisoner knocked my money out of my hand, and it fell upon the counter; I put both my hands upon it, and made him understand by my looks that I was very angry with him for taking such a liberty; he would keep meddling with the money on the counter, and he took his hand off in a flat direction, as if he had something between his fingers, quite like a slight of hand trick - he took his hand up, and his thumb was under his hand; I did not see any sovereign in his hand - I supposed his thumb was in such a position as to conceal something between that and the rest of his hand, and with his other hand he took up the sovereign which he had laid down; that was at a distinct part of the counter from my money - the other man with the turban was not there then; he had been in, and asked me to buy some spices, which I refused, and he went out - the prisoner then turned his back to me, and went out, putting his hand up to his mouth as if he placed something in it; he did not wait for his loaves or change - I had counted my sovereigns twice over just before, as I do every morning to set them down in the book; I counted them twice over again when he was gone, and I missed one.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Is the man, who stands here, the man who had the Turkish dress on? A. Yes - I knew nothing of the prisoner before; the prisoner knocked my money out of my hand, and it fell on the counter - none of it fell off; it was not a very severe blow, but it caused the whole of it to fall - I suppose he had, in his language, asked me for change, but I could not understand him - he put down the sovereign, and I took it for granted he wanted change; he kept meddling with the money, as if he was going to look out change for himself; his own sovereign still laid on the counter - I did not see him take any sovereign up but that; but when he was gone I counted, and missed one - there was no other person in the shop at the time; the man in the Turkish dress left before the prisoner - I had not, at that time, produced any money; I believe this was about eleven o'clock - I gave an alarm immediately I had an opportunity - our young man came into the shop, and I said "James, a man has been here and taken a sovereign, run after him;" but he did not go the right way - I then ran over to a neighbour at an opposite shop; a young man then ran after him, and had him taken by the Policeman, who found some silver on him - I had counted my money twice just before he came in, as I do every morning to set it down in the book - it was not ten minutes before he came in; no other customer came in, I am sure - I had counted all my money - I knew I had about 13s., but I did not know whether I had a half-sovereign or not - I had counted the silver, it was all in shillings: I had twenty-one sovereigns - I had no halfsovereign; I took it out to convince him that I had no half-sovereign - he asked me for a half-sovereign, and I did not know whether I had one or not - I gave an alarm within five minutes. I think.</p>
               <p>THOMAS LUDEGREEN. I am a Police-constable. I was on duty in the New-road on the morning of the 15th of June - I saw the prisoner and another man with a turban on; in consequence of information I took them both into custody - I took them to the baker's shop, in Seymour-street; I searched the prisoner in the parlour, and found in his left-hand waistcoat pocket two sovereigns loose - this is the bag which the prisoner had with him; I searched it afterwards, and found in it four 1d. loaves and four papers of tea - it has been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Where did you take him? A. In the New-road, about twenty minutes or half-past eleven o'clock, hardly so much as ten minutes' walk from the prosecutor's - they were both walking; the other man had a box; I found on the prisoner a silver snuff-box and a watch - he returned very willingly; the other man understood English, and I told him they must go back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, (through the interpreter). The other man is my assistant - I gave him 7s. 6d. a week, because he understands English, and he knows places; I gave him my box - when I went to the prosecutrix's shop I had nothing but two sovereigns in gold - I asked her to let me have a 3d. loaf; I took out a sovereign, and gave her to change - she sounded it well, and said she had no change; I said, "Give me a half-sovereign, and the rest in silver;" she said she had not any silver, and I went away - my assistant and I went into a house, and sold a coral necklace for 17s. 6d., which he keeps till the evening, and then he gives me an account of it - I know what is sold; he then said, "I am quite hungry;" I said, "We will go, and get four 1d. loaves," as we had the silver - we were then going to a public-house, and the officer took us both.</p>
               <p>ABRAHAM COHEN. I am a native of Alexandria. I was in the prisoner's employ; I carry his box of spice and necklaces - I go to every public-house and shop; I went into the prosecutor's shop before he did, and asked the lady if she wanted any thing - she said No; I came out, and he then went in - I did not see any thing he did in the shop: I went to a public-house opposite to sell some goods, and by the time he came out of the prosecutor's I was in the street again - he walked away as other people do; Seymour-street is a long street - we went together; he did not attempt to run or to conceal himself; we sold a coral necklace, and bought some bread - we received silver for the necklace, and paid 6d. for the bread; I had the rest of the silver in my pocket - I do not know what money the prisoner had when he went into the prosecutor's shop; the lady said he asked for change, and she had not change - that she put her money on the counter, and he wanted to take some; I told him so, and he said he took nothing.</p>

            , who keeps the Horse and Groom, at Hampstead. On the 24th of June the prisoner came there with a piece of beef, about a quarter after five o'clock - my master asked what he gave for it; he said 6s. - that he had bought it at a butcher's shop, and he asked master to cook it for him - my master said, as he was so tipsy, if he would go up to bed he would send it to the baker's, and I took it.</p>
               <p>PHILIP MOSE. I am a constable of Hampstead. I found the prisoner in bed at the top of Pilcher's house - I told him in coming down stairs if he would take me to the butcher's shop I would let him go; he had at first stated that he bought it at a butcher's shop, but when I got him out he said he bought it of a person in the town - I took him to the baker's, and then to the cage; he said, before the Magistrate, that he gave 2s. 4d. for it, but I understood him at first 1s. 2d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the day before, I had received part of my bounty, and got intoxicated - I never made mention of 6s.; I was stupidly drunk when I went to the public-house, and there I had some more drink - the landlord said if I would go and lay down on the bed he would let me know when his dinner came from the cook-house -I went up, and in fifteen minutes the officer came and took me; I had bought the beef for 1s. 2d. of a man who said he was a brick-setter, or a brickmaker - he said a butler had made him a compliment of it.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM BARLOW. I live in North-place, Kingsland-road. On Sunday, the 19th of June, I was on my way to church, and saw the prisoner and another young man in a field near a dung-heap - I have some ducks which run in and out of that field; on my return from church I missed one duck - about three o'clock I went again into the field, and saw the prisoner and another person driving the ducks about and trying to catch one; I set a watch, and went for a Policeman - on my return I missed a drake, and found the prisoner and the drake in my house: they had been taken there while I went for the Policeman.</p>
               <p>GEORGE BARTRAM. I am servant to the prosecutor. I saw the prisoner and another man in his field that Sunday, hunting the ducks - when the prisoner went away I pursued him, and Benfield took him, and took a drake from his pocket; the other man ran away.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BENFIELD. I was in the prosecutor's field on the Sunday afternoon. I saw the prisoner and another laying by the side of the pond; they then got up - I moved and looked over a wall; I saw the other feeding the duck with bread, and when they got between the two, the prisoner took one and put it into his pocket; they then went away - I pursued, and took the prisoner with the drake in his pocket.</p>

On the 7th of June my mother gave me a bundle, which I had seen a pair of trousers put into - I was to carry them to Mr. Jones, in Drury-lane: I met the prisoner in Great Queen-street - she came up to me, and asked me to carry a letter to Mrs. Merrit's, and if the lady was at home she would give me 1s.; she said she would give me 1s. when I came out - she said there was half a crown in the letter for a little boy: I was to take it to a court in Queen-street - she asked me to let her hold my bundle till I came out; I went to the place, but only went up a step or two of the house; when I returned the prisoner and my bundle were gone - I was looking for her, and saw William Mott; I told him what had happened, and went with him to a house in Queen-court - the prisoner was up stairs there, and Bellison went and fetched her out.</p>
               <p>JOHN BELLISON. I found the trousers in the cupboard of a room, the door of which was shut; the prisoner was on the landing-place.(Property produced and sworn to)</p>

I went to the Weavers' Arms on the 6th of June, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening; I saw the prisoner in the tap-room, and said I wanted him about a table - he said if I would go into the parlour he would speak to me about it; he then said he saw the parlour window of the house open, that he got in and took the table to his own lodging, and if I would go with him he would show it to me; I took him to Mrs. Peachey, and she identified him - I then went to his lodging; he took the key out of his pocket, opened the door, and showed me the table - he told me in the room, and also on the way to the station, that he went to the back of the house, got up the tiles, got in at the one pair back window, and took the table to take care of; he then said it was on the Sunday evening - he had before said it was on Saturday; he made no difficulty in showing me the table, but I had a good deal of trouble to coak him away - I took him to the station-house, and got from him a knife which he had; I then wanted the key of his lodging, but he said the whole five of us should not get that.</p>

I delivered the prisoner this linen on Monday, the 2nd of May, to go to Mrs. Gallin's to be washed and brought home clean on the Saturday, but it never came; the prisoner generally brought it in the afternoon - about five o'clock that Saturday she came crying very much, and said she did not know what she should do, she thought she should go out of her mind, as she had lost the linen; I asked how she came to lose it - she said she met a man, named William Ingley, whom she knew by sight, and he had another man with him - that they asked her to go to a public-house, where they had something to drink; that she then went and delivered one bundle of linen - that she then went into another house, at the corner of Tabernacle-walk, and while she was drinking there with the man she knew by sight, the other man went off with the things; she said the man asked where she was going, and she said to Goswell-street - he said he was going to Islington, and he would carry them for her, and then he went off with them; she has brought home the linen safe before.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. He says I was dressed in a blue frock-coat - it was just the contrary; he says again that I asked for a gentleman's chain - this is contrary to the statement he made before. Did you feel satisfied that I was speaking to a person inside? Witness. Yes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Was it a frock coat, or a dress coat I had on at your master's? A. I believe it was a dress coat, but I am not exactly confident - I recognized you in the Temple before I spoke to the officer; there was no one with you then - I saw you give a letter to a man; I believe you took the same course to go back again - you did not stop at all; you ran as fast as you could till you got to a place which was no thoroughfare - I knew him in a minute.</p>

In consequence of information, I went to the prisoner's shop, in High-street, St. Pancras, on the 20th of June, and asked him whether, in the course of the afternoon, any boys had been there to offer any metal, or part of a cock for sale; he said, No - I then asked whether he had not been employed as foreman to Mr. Champ, a butcher in the Hampstead-road; he said, Yes -I said, "Then I am right, you have bought part of a cock that was stolen from my premises this afternoon;" I said I had the boy in custody, that I had the key of the cock in my possession, and he had given 4d. for it - he then said,"Oh, yes, I recollect I have purchased such a thing;" he asked his wife for the key of the wash-house - he went backwards, and returned with the barrel of the cock which I had had stolen; I value it as old metal at 1s, but when new it cost me 9s. 6d, with the key - I know this is the one I had lost, as we had three of these made to a particular order, and the other two are safe; it is made of gun-metal.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When you brought the circumstance more minutely to his memory he said he did remember it? A. Yes; I certainly should not have bought it for any thing but old metal - I did not take the prisoner; I said, "I am going to the Policeoffice to-morrow," and he was there, and met me - I did not go with him to his back premises.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.He was not a member? A. No, only a visitor, and visitors enter their names; there is another porter besides me - our business is to be at the door, unless we are sent with messages: there is always a porter at the entrance to the news-room; the library is straight on - when I am on duty, persons leaving the library generally pass me; it is probable that a person could not pass with books of any size without my seeing them, but I did not see them - the members are not allowed to take books to their own homes; we often miss things, and find them again on the table - I cannot say who does it; I had not missed these books.</p>

            . I am principal librarian of the London Institution. I have examined these books - they all belong to the Institution: the marks have been erased very dexterously - looking at them in this general way I should say they were worth 3l. or 4l., but it would cost a great deal of money to replace them - some of these quarios cost 3l. or 4l. a-piece; this one has the mark clumsily taken out - this is more neatly done.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Can you see any mark in this book? A. Yes, here are some pencil marks in it of my own making - I have known them these twenty years.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord and Gentlemen. I have duty considered the perilous situation in which I stand, and I will beg to withdraw my plea and plead guilty - the distress of my family induced me to do it, my father and mother being thrown on my hands; I beg to leave myself to your mercy while you are considering your verdict, and I hope you will recommend me to the Court, in consequence of the distress of my family - we had been nearly one day without food; I had parted with every thing except my clothes, which I kept to apply for a situation, and then I adopted this step.</p>

            . I work for my father, and live in West-street, Smithfield. I was collecting jobs in the cutlery business, and was in St. Paul's church-yard - I saw Carter put his hand into the prosecutor's left-hand pocket; the other prisoner at that time had his hand on Carter's shoulder - Carter drew his hand out of the prosecutor's pocket, and put it behind him; his hand was close against the other prisoner's hand - I took hold of Carter's hand, with the handkerchief in it; I touched the gentleman, and said he had lost his handkerchief - the officer came up, and took the prisoners; Steel never had possession of the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What are you? A. A journeyman steel letter-cutter. Carter said I took the handkerchief myself; he would say any thing, but I did not take it - he said before the Alderman that I took it and threw it on the ground, but he did not say it at the time; I do not know whether any of the persons are here: I believe the officer saw it - I cannot tell how many persons were about; it was by the corner at the Goose and Gridiron - it was the day the charity children went to St. Paul's; there were a great many people about - I served my time to my father; I have been a street-keeper, and have been a witness several times - I cannot tell how many times - it might be half a dozen; I cannot say it has not been four dozen times - an officer is often a witness; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300066"/>have not always been a witness as an officer - I believe I have been sixteen or eighteen times a witness in this Court, and three or four times in the other, and three or four times at Westminster; I have not been a common cad to an informer - I was a constable in St. James', Westminster, six months, and left because my time was up; I was in the Police at Lambeth, and was dismissed for being asleep on my post - I had been in the country, and was put on duty directly I came back; that was the only charge against me - I was not an old watchman; I do not know what a cad to an informer is.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in St. Paul's church-yard, and saw Carter put his hand into the gentleman's pocket - I rushed forward, and saw the handkerchief in his hand; I caught him by the wrist, and Murray took the handkerchief from him - Steel was pressing against him at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Did you know him before? A. No - there might be thousands of persons in St. Paul's church-yard; I have been a witness at Guildhall sixteen times, but this is the first time I have been here - I was a witness in cases that were not sent here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.There was a considerable crowd? A. Yes - all I saw Steel do was to press against Carter; that might be from the effect of the crowd.</p>
               <p>MR. SMART. This is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never saw it in possession of either of the prisoners? A. No - there was a great crowd about, I could hardly pass.</p>
               <p>Carter's Defence. I picked up the handkerchief, and held it some time - this gentleman came and said I took it out of the prosecutor's pocket; the officer then came up and said he saw me take it, but he was not up for three minutes afterwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q.Had you not at that time intended to give him in charge? A.

               <p>MR. PALMER. These are what I had marked - there was some copper in the till, but we never count that; the morning takings vary from 5s. to 10s.</p>

               <p>FRANCIS WARDEN. I was in company with Mr. Wells. I saw him collar the prisoner, and take the handkerchief from him.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BECK. I received him in charge.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I picked up the gentleman's handkerchief - he turned round, said it was his, and took it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>MR. WELLS. It was in his hand when I seized him and he put it into his breast - he did not say he had picked it up, but complained of my tearing his clothes.</p>

Last Tuesday fortnight, about eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner's coat was in the warehouse; I examined it, having missed property, and found in it three pairs of unsewn gloves, enclosed in a piece of paper - I replaced them; he was in the house at the time - I obtained an officer, and placed him in the street, opposite my door; I then went up to dismiss the prisoner for the day - he went out without my saying any thing to him - I followed him, and when he had got a short distance up the Old Jewry, I called him back, and said I believed he would find something in his pocket which belonged to me: at that time I was not certain the gloves were mine, not having looked at the marks - tranks are gloves before they are sewn: I desired him to take them from his pocket, and he did so - I examined them, and found they were mine, by the cutter's mark in each of them: it is the writing of King, my cutter - I desired the constable to detain him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. He was nine month<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300069"/>in your employ? A. Yes - I did not inquire his character, having a recommendation from a third individual; he has been in the employ of Mr. Gardener, of Baldwin's-gardens, and others, I believe - he acknowledged that he put the gloves into his pocket; the other men had access to his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go out to speak to a relation? A.Somebody called him out, and that enabled me to examine his coat pocket - I had been robbed very frequently, and could not ascertain who it was.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING. I was in the employ of Mr. Watts for sixteen months. I know nothing of the offence - I saw the prisoner in custody at the Mansion-house; the officer showed me a pair of tranks, and the mark on them is the letter K., which is like my writing; I cannot be on my oath that it is my writing - I would not swear to my handwriting on leather; I cannot say it was written by me - it is like mine, that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, as far as you can judge of the writing on the gloves, do you believe it to be your writing? A. Yes, I believe it to be.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw it in the officer's hands at a distance? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am a street-keeper of Coleman-street ward. The prisoner was given to me, charged with stealing these gloves; he did not say a word to me - he would not say any thing - I have had the gloves ever since.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HENMAN. I am an officer. I have thirtyeight pairs of silk tranks, which I discovered on searching the prisoner's lodging, directly after he was taken.</p>
               <p>MR. WATTS. Three pairs of gloves would consist of thirty-six pieces of leather - these found on the prisoner are leather tranks: I found two marks on them, one is the letter G., another K., which is the cutter's mark; I can swear to it being King's hand-writing - I have been familiar with his writing ever since he has been with me; the same mark is on each pair - I see his hand-writing every day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Will you swear positively that letter K. is his writing? A. I will - I have not a doubt on earth of it; I am quite sure it is his writing.</p>
               <p>JOHN KING. I have seen these before - it was a pair of the larger parcel that I saw at the Mansion-house; here is the letter K. on these three pairs - I think the K. here has been written by me; it is like mine, and corresponds greatly with it - I believe it to be my hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. WATTS. Q. Was the prisoner in the habit of taking goods out to work-people? A. Not for the last two months, but he had been previously, only to get them embroidered, and that was always by my direction.</p>
               <p>Q.Has there been any malice existing between the prisoner and the men? A. I have frequently heard men quibbling, but am not aware of that with respect to him - his coat had been in the warehouse from tea time - very few persons had been there that day; they could not have placed the gloves there.</p>

On the 28th of June, about a quarter to eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the shop alone, and saw the prisoner looking in at the window, which was open - he took a book off the shelf, which is at least two feet within the shop, put it under his coat, and made off with it; I went out - he ran very fast, but I secured him in St. Paul's church-yard, without losing sight of him, and took the book from under his coat; it is Egan's Life in London - he said nothing.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The prisoner occupied my first floor room for a fortnight, and had the use of this blanket - her husband is engine-keeper at the Norwich Union; on the 20th of June I missed this blanket - she was continually intoxicated - I suspected her, and told her she must get another lodging, and every thing must be made right previous to her leaving; I charged her with taking a blanket and other things - she did not deny it; her husband had told me to take the rest of the things out of the room, or they would all be gone - I have lost a variety of things, which she confessed to taking.</p>
               <p>LEONARD MATTHEWS. I am a pawnbroker.

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Why did you enter the room with a false key while I was out? A. I deny it - she came home intoxicated, and was found sleeping in the privy, with her two children; she had lost her key - all the lodgers tried their keys, and one opened her door, which I was not aware of before.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not intoxicated - is it possible he could know what was gone without entering the room? I pawned the blanket to support my husband, who was ill with an accident.</p>

               <p>TIMOTHY DARLEY. I am a ship-joiner. I was in St. Paul's church-yard, and saw the prisoner take this printed cotton from Mr. Bailey's shop, and walk off with it; I was going the same way as him, and when he turned down Newgate-street, I tapped him on the shoulder, and told him he had better take it back; he was very unwilling, and threatened to strike me with his fist, but did not - several people came up, and I gave him in charge; I went back with him - he had the cotton under his coat; he said I had nothing to do with it - he is a soldier.</p>

               <p>JOHN CHURCHILL. I am a constable. I saw some persons collected, and took the prisoner - he was charged with taking this print; he said he was not going to give it to the witness.</p>

On the 20th of June, between eleven and twelve o'clock at night I was coming from a friend's on Addlehill - I was sober; I went into Fleet-street, for a walk - I had left my friends about ten o'clock; I met the prisoner in Fleet-street - she came up and asked if I had any objection to go with her; I went with her to <placeName id="t18310630-109-crimeloc588">No. 5, Crown-court, Fleet-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BALL. Q. Were they not on the same bed with you? A. Yes; I was sitting on the bed-side - neither of them took off her gown; I did not promise them the half-sovereign for any thing - I had given the other 1s., and took out my purse to give it her; I am not married.</p>
               <p>MARK ADAMS. I am a watchman. On the 20th of June I was on duty in Crown-court; this is a common brothel - I was called in by the landlord, about twelve o'clock, who said a gentleman up stairs accused a woman of robbing him - I went up; the prosecutor appeared to be sober, he said he had been robbed of half a sovereign, and accused the prisoner of it; there was another female in the room - he had half a crown in his hand out of the purse, and said the half-sovereign was taken out of the purse and gone, that he had found the half-crown and purse on the bed; the women undressed, in my presence, to satisfy me - the other had 1s., which he said he had given her; I said he had better give her into custody, and leave it to the decision of the night officer, which they all agreed to - I took them there and left them there.</p>
               <p>JAMES CHICKELDAY. I was the night-officer. The prisoner and another were brought to the watch-house -Wilmott charged the prisoner with robbing him of a halfsovereign; I took her back and searched her, but could not find it - he made no charge against the other; she said to the other girl, "Oh, what a bother this is about this half-<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300071"/>sovereign, you may as well tell," or something to that purpose - the girl said, "I know nothing whatever about it, you know I don't:" I had not done searching her before she (the prisoner,) said again, "Oh, if you go to the house you will find the half-sovereign under the mattress;" I went immediately, and on turning up the bed, on the mattress, I found the half-sovereign, which I have had ever since - the prisoner did not claim it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This conversation was in the presence of Mary Madden? A. Yes; she said, "If you know where it is, give it up to him;" and afterwards the prisoner told where it was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Were they strangers to you? A. Yes; I am porter to Mr. Gast, the gunmaker - this was about half-past two o'clock; I was ten or twelve yards from him - there was no person between me and Collier at the time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. HEATON. Q. If there were other people about him could you see this?

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. I believe it was in May, 1829, he came into your service? A. Yes; he had not to do the duty of two clerks, or any extra duty - he might in my absence have accounted to my partner, or to other persons; he was not always at home in an evening; he used sometimes to go out as a traveller for a day or two - I do not know that he was ever out for a week, or that I ever allowed a period of two weeks to pass without requiring an account; I always asked him what money he had when I saw him in the office - on the 23rd of January I showed him a letter from a gentleman, stating that he had paid his account; he had entered some money two or three days before that, and I had gone through his books with him about a weeks before -I had gone through the books weeks and weeks after Christmas, as some were behind hand; I never entered into any negotiation with him to treat these sums as a debt, and for him to give me security; I did mention the name of a Mr. Abbot, an attorney, but I did not direct him to go to him - I did not speak of a bill of sale, or warrant of attorney; he mentioned them to me - I did not send any person to take an inventroy of his effects - I authorized Mr. Abbot to hand over to the prisoner a small sum of money due from Dr. Phillimore, after the discovery; I know there was some money paid to the firm -I believe there is a bill of 25l. from Mr. Bryan; at the time he was taken, he stated there was about 15l. due to him for wages - there was not a bill of 20l. for disbursements; there was about 4l. for some trifling expences.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Did he ever account to you for the three sums mentioned in the indictment? A. No - the sums alleged to be due to him would not cover the sums he has received by eight or ten times; he has received above 300l. for which he has not accounted.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Should the sums he receive be entered in a book? A. Yes - he enters them himself, and then hands them over to me; he left us abruptly, without notice.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose the Penitentiary dress is well known in that neighbourhood? A. Yes - if he had gone out in that dress there is no doubt he would have been known instantly; I heard that after he had got away himself, he came back to assist a friend - there was nothing to prevent his going off when he was out.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Had he behaved so well that he was made a wardsman and a teacher? A. Yes, he was a well conducted man in every respect.</p>
               <p>THE REV. WHITWORTH RUSSELL. I am chaplain to the Penitentiary. The prisoner had behaved well, and had the good opinion of all the persons in the prison - his full time of imprisonment was but twelve months longer, and if he had behaved well, no doubt it would have been shortened; a little after ten o'clock on the night in question, I was writing in my study, and an alarm was made that some prisoners had escaped from Pentagon 5 - I hastened to the garden, and there joined the patrol, (Young,) and the governor: we went to the outer wall, and there found a piece of linen, used in the prison, placed against the wall as a sort of ladder - it was linen which had been woven in the ward where the prisoner had been; it was then supposed that the prisoners had escaped, and the governor directed search to be made outside, but I suggested they might be in the garden; we proceeded to make search, and against the wall of the prison I found the prisoner and Thompson, who immediately surrendered themselves to us - I saw the clothes taken from the prisoner; they belonged to Mr. Hawthorn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prison clothes, I suppose, are decent warm comfortable clothing? Yes, they are partly green and partly brown - it is a uniform that is known, and would have at once advertised to persons outside where they came from; the prisoner had been appointed by myself a monitor of one of the classes in the schools - there was plate and other things of value in the prison, but he could not have access to that.</p>

            . I am assistant task-master in the Penitentiary. On the 8th of April I went out, having locked my door, and deposited the key with the task-master; I returned at ten o'clock, and found my trunk had been broken open, and the lock forced off - I missed a coat and a pair of boots; I afterwards found a skeleton-key in the prisoner's prison clothes which he had left behind; it appeared to be made of mixed metal, such as the cups which the prisoners use - these clothes were taken from the prisoner, and are mine.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was that the room you reside in? A. It is the room I sleep in, and the trunk was there - there were other articles in my trunk; I had taken my linen out that evening to wash - there were other things he might have stolen.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Is it an inconvenient thing for a man who has a wall to climb to have a bundle? A. Yes - the wall, I suppose, is twenty feet high; these are my clothes, and the prisoner had them on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. They were not stolen with an intent of getting gain by them, but to assist in gaining my liberty - had I had any other means I should not have done it; when I got out I should have got some clothes of my own, and these would have been returned, or full restitution made - there were other articles, which we did not take.</p>

I most solemnly assure you the evidence is grossly false - I know nothing at all of the robbery; I had not been out of my father's house ten minutes, and was going to my brother's, in the same road, when the prosecutor came and look me - he was going to give me to the Policeman, and I ran away.</p>

               <p>JOHN HEATHWAITE. I am in the employ of the prosecutor. The prisoner asked me to weight him a knockle of ham - the Policeman came in, and took him; these are my master's property.</p>

I gave him change of 1s.; he was there with two bad characters; whether they took it or not I cannot tell; Mr. Bird was my master, hot Mr. Tell - he had only been there two or three days; I had lived nearly six months at the Crown, and not knowing what a place Mr. Bird's was I went there to get a better birth - I always wore a seal-skin cap; the two women were not strangers to the house - Mr. Bird knew them well; the prosecutor gave the girl a penny to get some sugar.</p>

I am waiting for you;" I said, "I am very glad you are;" I took hold of his arm, thinking he was going home with me - we got about half way up Moorfields, and he said what was I going to do; I said I wanted to know how I was to get my rent and my things - he said he had not a halfpenny in the world; I said,"You will have no objection to go and see my husband;" he said, "I suppose you are going to put me into the Compter" - he gave me a shove, and ran off; I cried Stop thief! and a gentleman stopped him - I came up to him; he gave me another shove, and ran off again; he was not taken till last Friday.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.Was the prisoner, during the whole time he was in your house, in the greatest possible distress? A. I never had any reason to think he was in distress - I sent for an officer on the 9th of September; that was to see for my property. and I took the duplicates - I should think there were fifty; I did not bargain that if he would give me the duplicates, and give security for the rent, that the officer should be sent away - I received the duplicates, and the officer went away; I said if they would give me a note of hand for 3l. I would forgive them the 1l. 15s. - some of the duplicates were not run out at that time, but it was not in my power to get the things out; I received a note of hand, and they remained between a week and a fortnight afterwards - my husband did not turn the prisoner out of his house without any covering for him or his wife, and say he would break his neck if he did not go out; I never received any money on the note of hand - his mother would not stand any more than 3l. for him; I did not agree to discharge him of all he owed me on receiving the security for the 3l. - I have not been to the prisoner since he has been in prison; I do not know whether my husband has - I do not know that my husband has offered to take 3l.; my husband has told the prisoner, when he was out of work, that he would employ him as a labourer, and he said he was not brought up to hard work - the prisoner was in work, holding up his finger at the back of an omnibus; I got a pair of sheets out for fear I should get no more, but I do not know that they belong to me.</p>

On the 13th of June the prisoner came to his shop, and asked for some silk handkerchiefs which were in the window - I took them out; he chose one - while he was doing that, I observed him concealing something under his apron, and when he was going out I got over the counter, and stopped him; this is the handkerchief he had chosen, and this other I took from his person under his apron - he had paid 1s. 6d. for one; the one he took is worth 3s. 6d. - it is silk; he appeared to be trying to tuck this one under his apron.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q.Was that handkerchief laying loose on the counter? A. No, it was hanging up behind him - it might have fallen down; I only saw him fumbling - I had not seen this particular handkerchief to notice it the whole day, but I know I had hung it up there the day before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you some of that pattern hanging in the window? A. No, they were tied in a bundle, but this one was hanging up singly, apart from the bundle - there were several other handkerchiefs hanging in the same place, but not of this pattern.</p>
               <p>Four witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

               <p>PHILIP PHILLIPS. This box is my property; I had it about me at the Royal Exchange, on the 18th of June - it is worth about 40s.</p>

               <p>Brown. Q.Might it not have fallen from your pocket? A.It is not very likely - it was in my inside coat pocket, inside the flap of my coat; there was nothing else in the pocket.</p>
               <p>Brown's Defence. I was coming along Throgmorton-street, and picked it up where the men were paving; two or three men saw me pick it up - the officer called; I took it out, and showed it to him.</p>

            . The prisoner was working at the next house to us on Monday, the 23rd of May; his master asked my father to let him go through our house to repair the roof - that was not in my presence, but I have heard him ask leave on other occasions; he is a jobbing plumber, and was mending the leads of the next house - I was in my mother's bed-room at twelve o'clock, and all was safe; I went up again between two and three, and found the room door had been unlocked - I did not take particular notice of that, but went into my own room, which is the adjoining one, and when I came back, I saw a drawer in my mother's room open; the lock was wrenched quite off - it was hanging loose; three drawers were broken open; I wrote to my mother, and she came home - I know the seals belong to my mother; I had seen the prisoner come in, and heard him go up stairs, a little after one o'clock that day, while I was engaged with a lady in the shop - I did not see him come down, for I went to dinner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there a carpenter at work at your house? A. Yes, but he had gone to dinner; we have four lodgers.</p>

            . On the Tuesday evening, about six o'clock, I searched the prisoner, and found these two seals and a key attached to his watch - the prosecutrix and her daughter swore to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was he not wearing them openly? A. He was - the watch was returned to him; the prosecutrix thought that she recognized it, but would not swear to it - the prisoner's brother was there, and said it was his watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prosecutrix sworn to the seals at the first examination? A. No; she partly swore to them at the second - the question was not put to her at the first examination, and she did not understand it; she saw them on the bench, and said to me, that to the best of her knowledge they were her seals - I do not think she was sworn at the first examination; the seals are cast.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I took the prisoner on Tuesday. and saw the seals taken from his person; I was called up into the room which was broken open, and found these two chisels in the next room, they agreed with the marks on the drawers - there were marks of whitening on the floor, and the print of nails on the carpet; his shoes were taken off, and had nails in them -I did not count the nails.</p>

It was weighed on the 24th of May; I know there was butter in it - I never opened it, nor saw the butter; Cooper weighed it - the invoice calls it 66 lbs.; I did not hear what passed between the prisoners - Cooper went back into the counting-house, to the desk, directly; here is the weighing-book in which Cooper has entered the weight - I know it is his own writing; he has written "58 firkins," with other numbers, and 58 is branded on the firkin - here is, against the 58, G. x B.B., which shows that it is the mark on the firkin - we deal in cheese, butter, and lard.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you put cheese into firkins? A. No; we sometimes put lard in - here is butter sticking to the sides of the firkin now; it has been in Mr. Smith's custody.</p>

            . I am a clerk to the prosecutors. On the 27th of May I was coming to my employ, and saw Fagan come out of the warehouse door with a firkin of butter - I followed him to the Magpie and Stump, saw him put it down on the counter, and saw him given in charge; I returned to the warehouse, and saw Cooper - nothing passed between us; I had given information on the Thursday before this - Cooper was taken into custody that morning and taken to Mr. Acock's private house; I did not see the firkin opened - a firkin weighs from 66 to 67 lbs., and at that time was worth about 3l.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you ever see any butter in it? A. I did not; it was charged as<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300085"/>butter - I know it was full at the Magpie and Stump, for I pulled it on one side to see the mark.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutors. After the prisoners were committed the firkin was brought to our warehouse; I sent it to one of our retail shops, and charged it as 67 lbs. of butter; if it had contained any thing else I should have heard of it - it now has a little butter at the sides; I was at Mr. Acock's when Cooper was brought there, charged with stealing a firkin of butter - I do not exactly recollect what he said, but I am sure I heard him beg for mercy.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. A great many things were talked of besides butter? A. Yes; the firkin was not produced there.</p>

               <p>Fagan's Defence. I am a poor man, and work in Newgate-market; Cooper employed me to go down to the warehouse at half past eight o'clock, to take a firkin of butter - he gave me 1s. to carry it, and 4d. to pay the booking; it is very hard for me to be brought into trouble - Cooper promised to exonerate me before the Court, but he has not said a word.</p>
               <p>Cooper. He is totally innocent - I received the order from Mr. Ware, and employed him to carry the butter; it was my intention to book it if I had time.</p>
               <p>JURY to JOHN EVANS. Q.What direction was on the firkin? A.Mr. Ware, Hampstead - he was a casual customer of the prosecutors, for ready money only; I know nothing of his having ordered a firkin of butter that morning - when we send butter to an inn, we always send a porter's book to have a receipt; if this had gone out regularly the book would have been sent to be signed.</p>

            . On the morning of the 27th of May, I was at Mr. Holmes', watching the prosecutors' premises - all the men had gone to breakfast, except the prisoners; it was between half-past eight and nine o'clock - Barnard was a porter in their employ; before the firkin of butter was taken, I saw Cooper in front of the warehouse, and Barnard behind; I saw Barnard come up the ware-house to Cooper - he appeared to communicate with Cooper: he made a stop as if to speak to him - Barnard then immediately went up stairs; I saw him come down with a ham on his shoulder - he went to where Cooper stood, and there they both put it into a bag, and Barnard took it away out of the warehouse; I was not near enough to see the direction on the bag - I followed Barnard, and saw Fagan waiting at the corner of Distaff-lane; I desisted, and waited to watch the other transaction - while Cooper was at Mr. Acock's house, we asked him about the ham Barnard had taken away; he said he had sold it to Barnard, and he was to pay for it out of his wages on Saturday night - Barnard came in in about half an hour, and I asked where he had taken the ham to, which he had taken from his master's premises; he said he had taken it home, that it was taken by Cooper's directions, and he was to take it out at dinner time, to some place where Cooper had sent it to - he did not say where; Cooper was present - I afterwards went to Barnard's lodging, found the ham in the bag, and brought it away; Cooper afterwards pleaded for Barnard, and begged his master to let him go.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Cooper told you it was to be paid for out of the man's wages? A. Yes, and Barnard said he was to take it where Cooper was to direct him.</p>
               <p>Cooper. When I spoke of the ham, I said Barnard was to take part of it, and I was to take the other - I weighed it, and should have entered it at the same time as the firkin; he says half an hour elapsed, now I was at the book when Gunstone came - I had it in my hand, intending to enter both the articles.</p>

               <p>Barnard's Defence (written). I am entirely innocent of any intention to defraud my masters; I never in my life, either directly or indirectly, robbed my employers of a single farthing,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300086"/>or property of any description, or suffered any one to do it with my knowledge; I considered, my Lord, when I obeyed the order of Mr. Cooper, their clerk, I was doing no more than my duty; I had no conception, when ordered to take the ham to my house, there to remain until called for, but that it was perfectly consonant with every honest intention.</p>

The prisoner was employed by him on Saturday, the 11th of June, to serve behind the counter - he has been employed to assist on a busy day for about two months back; I saw him take some silver from a customer - he went to the till to put his change in, and put half a crown into his pocket; he had no change to give the customer - I asked him to walk with me into the warehouse; I there accused him of taking the half-crown: he said he was very sorry for what he had done, that it was owing to the great distress he was in, and he hoped I would not tell Mr. Felix - I said I had suspected him all the evening; he then gave up 1l. 9s. 6d. which he laid on a hogshead - he said he had taken it from the till, and be hoped I would not tell Mr. Felix; there were half-crowns, shillings, and, I believe, a 5s. piece or two - I wished him to walk into the kitchen, and told Mr. Felix to go down; next morning I sat in the same chair as he had sat in the night before, and found a paper under it with 1l. 17s. in it.</p>

I was called into Mr. Felix's shop on the 11th of June; I received 2l. 13s. in half-crowns and other silver - I took the prisoner, and before we went to the Magistrate he said he had laid some silver on the floor where he sat when I took the charge, and he hoped Mr. Felix would not prosecute him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell him any precise sum? A.No, my Lord, no sum was mentioned; he only said it was silver - this is my name (looking at his deposition) - it is here stated that I said he told me he put 16s. in a paper, but I did not.</p>

               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, denying that he had acknowledged putting the paper of silver under the chair.</p>
               <p>MR. FELIX. He had been my occasional servant for a considerable time; his friends are friends of mine; I was told he had been ten years in one situation - he was not under any engagement to attend on Saturdays; he might have got work where he pleased.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.Who drove the cart? A. It was standing still when I saw it, but Styles had the whip in his hand, and he unloaded it when the Policeman desired him: when I approached the yard the gate had been opened to let the cart out - as I went up Beasley said to me, "Sir, this person (meaning Hobbs) prevents the cart from going out of the gate;" I replied I supposed he knew what he was doing - Hobbs then directed it to be unloaded, and Styles told him what he would find; the dung is Beasley's perquisite, to dispose of to whom he pleases - Styles signified that he brought the hay and straw from home - that his father sold hay and straw, and he had designed to leave it at a public-house at Brompton; all the hay and straw on those premises belonged to my employers - there was no other stable there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When was this? A. On the 16th of May - it was a cart boarded all round.</p>

I said, "I have a suspicion something is wrong here, and I shall have it unloaded;" Styles said, "I will tell you what I have got - I have a truss of hay and a truss of straw;" I said I should see it unloaded. and as soon as I saw that under the dung, I should seize it, and take them into custody - I found it, and sent for Bates; Beasley then said to the foreman, "I don't know, it is a bad job;" I took the hay and straw to the station - Styles said he had brought it from his father's, and he was to leave it at the Bell and Horses, at Brompton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The foreman, I suppose, knows as well as you do, what Styles said to him? A. Yes - he said it was a bad job; there was not only me to hear it, but others; I do not think I mentioned that till to-day - Beasley said a good many more things that were not mentioned.</p>

            .I am an inspector of the Police. I went to the prosecutor's premises about half-past six o'clock - I compared the hay and straw found under the dung with that in the hay-loft; they appeared to me to be of the same quality - I ordered the prisoners to be taken to the watch-house; Beasley said it was a bad job for him - he did not put the hay and straw into the cart, but it was another person: I am quite sure he made use of these words.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the foreman present? A. No - if Hobbs has said that was said to the foreman, it is not true - he did not say where Styles had put it into the cart; he said it was the other man - Styles said he brought it from his father's.</p>

            . I was near the prosecutors' premises at a quarter-past five o'clock in the morning, on the 16th of May - I saw the cart coming up Swallow-street, and Styles was with it; I had watched it, in consequence of what I had heard - I will swear that at the time it entered the yard it was empty; I was not present when it was unloaded.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.Was it not boarded with boards<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300088"/>all round, two feet eight, or two feet ten inches high? A. It might be, but I got on the wheel to look into it while Styles was gone into the yard to speak to the ostlers - he left the horse and cart for a few minutes close to the gate.</p>
               <p>Styles' Defence. I have two witnesses who saw me put the hay and straw into the cart, and rode with it part of the way - when I came up Swallow-street the Policeman stood in Regent-street; he never came near me - I knocked, and went into the yard - I had some potatoes and greens in the cart at the time.</p>
               <p>Beasley's Defence. I got up and put on my smallclothes to left Styles in - I then went and put on my clothes, and when I came down again the load was partly in.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. The prosecutor said it was a dark night? A. It was not particularly dark: it was daybreak; I should not have known a man running seventy or eighty yards from me - I did not see any one else in the loft.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

I cannot say - two persons went out just after him; they were the last three that went out - they all went out before I closed the door; they went out together, within a minute or two - I did not rub them down; none of them had any bulky appearance - none of them had a bundle of this dimension, but the things might he divided; I looked at them all as they passed - I do not know whether the prisoner had been drinking with them; I have tap-room, parlour, and all to attend to - it was about twelve o'clock when they went: it was not later - I can swear they did not go out in company.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live at Uxbridge. On the 28th of May, after I had done my baking, I went out to carry home pies - I went to the Rose and Crown, and saw the prosecutor there, very tipsy, ill-treating an old man - he then went and treated Ann Clayton with half a pint of rum; he treated another prostitute - he was then rolling about, and upsetting every one; I went to bed at half-past twelve o'clock - the prisoner lodged in my house, and was there at two o'clock; I went through his room, and said, "What do you do here not undressed?" he said, "I was so tipsy I could not undress;" I was called up at half-past four, and he was not up then - I was at home from two till half-past four, and he was at home at that time, I am certain, but I do not know what time he came in; my house is about thirty yards from Whitton's - I did not get up to let him in; the key was in the window.</p>

            .

On the 10th of June the prisoner Thompson came and asked me to let him look at some gold seals,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300094"/>which I did - he then asked me to rub one of them with a bit of leather, that he might see how it looked; I had the leather close by me, and I rubbed it - he then said it was too large, and he wished to know what I would make him two for, between the sizes of those I had - I said I could not tell him, as my husband was not at home - he then put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a chased gold key, and asked if I could make him one exactly like that, with a cornelian stone in it, for 25s. - I said I could not tell myself; at that time the other prisoner came in, and asked for some shirt-studs - I thought things were not right, and I said, rather abruptly, "When I have done with this customer I will attend to you;" Thompson then asked me the price of this ring which I have in my purse, and I said, "I told you, 5s. 6d.;" he then dropped it down - I told him he had got some more; he said he had not, but I said,"You have, Sir;" he then shook these three rings and this seal out of the cuff of his coat - he said, "There they are, there they are;" I said he had more - he said he had not, and out he ran; I said to the children in the shop, "Look sharp!" and I ran after him - I lost sight of him, but I am able to say he is the same man; I was standing in Swan-street about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, and saw him coming up - he had changed his coat, but I was quite certain of his features; I followed him to Brick-lane - he went into a house, and was there taken; I cannot swear to Wilkinson, but it was a man much like him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. What coloured coat had the man on, who first came about the seals? A. A brown frock-coat; when I saw Thompson in Swan-street he had an old blue coat on - he had the same trousers; about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes had passed - I lost three rings, two smaller ones, and a brooch, and five the officer has; I brought Thompson back to the shop, and delivered him to an officer - I did not at that time charge any body else with it; the other man was not near my goods; I said, before the Justice, that I had no room to suspect him, and I say so still; my servant is not weak in the head - she is not very brisk, but she knows a person again; there was nothing found on Thompson - I think it was on Friday week; there was a charge made against Wilkinson - the Policeman said he knew he lived in the same house with Thompson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.What time did the prisoner leave your shop? A. I think between one and two o'clock.</p>

            . I live in Church-street, Bethnalgreen, and am a hair-dresser. I heard a cry of Stop thief! on Friday, the 10th of June, about two o'clock in the afternoon; I went out, and saw Mrs. Lampard - I pursued a man, who I believe was Thompson, but I could not swear to him, as he had changed his coat when I caught him; I followed him to Hare-street, which is thirty or forty yards from Swan-street, and there I lost sight of him; I afterwards saw Thompson in Swan-street, who, I believe, was the man I saw before - I followed him to a green-grocer's shop, where he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q.When you saw him in Swan-street, how was he dressed? A.In a blue coat and brown trousers, and the man I first saw had an olive frock coat on, either an olive brown or an olive green - the man in brown looked round once or twice, while I was pursuing him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. From the two or three times he looked round, had you such an observation of his face as to be able to give any opinion, as to whether he is the man? A. I believe he is.</p>

On the 31st of May the prisoner came to our shop, at a quarter before nine o'clock in the morning - I sell a few second-hand clothes; she asked for a child's frock - I had seen her the day before, when she asked the price of the same frock - she asked leave to try the frock on her child, which she had with her - she did so; it was too long; she asked me for a needle and thread, to run it up, which I gave her - while she sat working, she asked me what time it was; I went to a cupboard where my husband's watch hung, and told her it wanted five minutes to nine - the cupboard was close by where she sat; I am not certain whether I shut the cupboard door or not - a woman with a child in her arms afterwards came to the door, and inquired the price of an article - I stood outside the door, talking to that woman for two or three minutes -I then went in again, and in a short time the prisoner left the house; no other person had been in before she left, and there were no inmates in the house but myself - no one could pass me while I was outside; the door opens into the room - as the prisoner was going out, she asked me to let her leave the child's dirty frock, and the key of her streetdoor, till she returned; I did - she had paid me before she run the frock up; she then went out, and in about half an hour I missed my watch, chain, seals, and key - no other customer had been in the interval; my husband had gone out while she was sitting there - he went out before I had looked at the watch; as soon as I had missed the watch, I went to my sister, who lives next door but one, and she went to some pawnbrokers to stop it - I then went to some other pawnbrokers; I had given a description of her, and when she returned for her key and her child's dirty frock, she was detained - I found her in custody when I returned in about two hours and a half.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Where was she taken into custody? A. At my sister's, who is not able to attend - I only went on the step to speak to the other woman; I did not say any thing to her - the prisoner did not say she was going to leave her residence; she said she wished to leave the key, because it was heavy - my husband did not return till my sister fetched him to the station-house; while the prisoner was in my shop I took a pair of white stockings out of a drawer, and sat down to mend them - I did not get up till I went to look at the watch again, and it was gone: I deal in nothing but wearing-apparel and shoes - I believe there are idle persons and disorderly boys about: the prisoner said, in my hearing, that she had come back for the frock and the key.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Was your husband at home when she first came? A. Yes, he was in the garden, and when he came in she was sitting in the chair; there were two rooms below, and one up stairs - I can distinctly swear that no one entered the shop from the time I looked at the watch till I missed it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see it in the cupboard yourself at that time? A. No; I did not return for three or four hours.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was returning for the frock and the key of the street door, and the prosecutor's shop was shut - I asked her sister where she was, and she said she wanted to speak to me; she took me to her house, and gave me in charge - I said I had never seen it; I had been to look at two houses after I left the prosecutrix's, and called again for my key and frock.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the night of the 20th of June, I saw the prisoner going down Phillips'-buildings; in about an hour I saw him coming up Phillips'-buildings, following my brother officer up his beat - he went on as far as Isaac's-place, and as soon as he saw my brother officer off his beat, another person came out of Isaac's-place to the prisoner, and they went down together; I followed them down, and when I got to the second corner I met the prisoner with this sack upon his back, containing this harness, which the prosecutor claims - I took hold of him by the collar; his companion then came up, and knocked me down - the blow I received left me insensible, and they both got away; the prisoner had dropped this bag off his shoulder when I took hold of him, and I found it there when I came to myself - I had frequently seen the prisoner before about the fields, gambling and playing at skittles; I took him about half-past eight o'clock the same evening - he denied that he was the man, but said he recollected meeting me in Phillips'-buildings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.When he met you did he not bid you good night? A. No one bid me good night - I swear they did not; I was near my brother officer - there is a boy like the prisoner who carries baked potatoes about; he wears a light coat - I do not know any others like him; I know the person who knocked me down.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I live at No. 18, Weston-street, Somers'-town, and am a basket-maker. I have brought up the prisoner from his infancy - his father and mother left him with us to nurse, and they have deserted him - we believe they are dead; we Christened him by our name - there are several boys like him in the neighbourhood; I have been deceived myself several times - I have even raced a boy when I thought the prisoner was not gone on his errand, and have then found my mistake: the prisoner lodged with me, and had a key to let himself in - he was never in prison; he was once taken for tossing, that is all.</p>

            . I live with my father, in King-square, Horse Shoe-alley, which is nearly opposite the back of Mr. Kent's house; I was up all night at work with my mother, and about four o'clock in the morning I went to the window, and saw two men at a dust-hole in our court, about four houses from the back of Kent's premises - each of them took a parcel out of the dust-hole, and put them into the prisoner's basket - she was there with another woman: the bundles appeared to contain something soft - I am quite sure the prisoner is the woman; it was day-light - I saw her in custody in about a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.What time was it? A. I first saw them at the dust-hole about four o'clock; the women were there all the time, from the time she came till she went away; the bundles appeared concealed in the dust-hole, as if they had come to fetch them; I did not see them placed there - they were deposited in the dust-hole; there was not time to break the premises open and bring the property there while I saw them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.When you first looked out of window was any body at the dust-hole? A.They were going to the dust-hole then - they were passing our window; they came out of Horse Shoe-alley - I should know the men again.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you seen the prosecutor's premises? A. I went there about two hours after; it might have been done by women or men, for there are the most notorious thieves in that neighbourhood, in Golden-lane, where they live; I went to the prisoner's place on the Saturday - there is a whole family there in the name of Hooker; I cannot tell whether a man lives with her as her husband - we took a man named Hooker on suspicion, being found walking about that very morning at two o'clock - he had three hearings, and was discharged; I stopped the prisoner in Bishopsgate-street, and asked how she came by the bundles - she said a man she met at that time in the morning, had hired her; I do not recollect whether I stated this to the Magistrate - my deposition was read over to me by the clerk; the dust-hole is on my beat - it communicates with the back of a shed at the back of Mr. Kent's house - there is a wall crosses; a person could step on the dust-hole, and get on the top of the wall, and scale the wall about thirty feet into the premises - the wall may be about twelve feet high.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What height must a person drop from the top of the wall? A. They could step on a gasmeter about four feet down, and then from the gas-meter three or four feet to the ground.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are not certain that you had seen him before? A. No - I know he was on the bridge; he put his arm through, and undid the gate - that is not the gate that was broken: I saw the prisoner again on the Wednesday - I did not suspect any thing till I heard of the robbery.</p>

               <p>Q.Were you in the room all that time? A. No; about half-past seven or eight o'clock I got up from the table to take a newspaper from a person who was there; the picture was on the table then - a few words passed between the person and myself, and when I turned round Mr. Platts directed my attention to the table, and said the picture was gone; the prisoner was the only person who left the room at that time - my back had been turned to the table to receive the newspaper; it was rather too large for my pocket, and I put it on the table - nobody could have taken it unless I had gone away from the table a few minutes; I went a yard and a half or two yards from the table, to take the newspaper - I was not away more than three or four minutes at the furthest, and in about ten minutes the prisoner returned; I merely said to him,"Do you know where my picture is?" he commenced looking under the tables and benches, and said, "I know nothing of the picture;" he began wiping his forehead, and said he had been to Hampstead-road - the person I had the paper from said, "Then you have been but a short time going and coming back;" I should imagine it is a mile and a half, or two miles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q.When you first went in the morning a third person was there? A. Yes, he was in and out - he was there when I discovered my loss: a person named Bousfield was in the room when I missed my picture - I live in Greek-street; I went there in the morning, feeling very thirsty, and was there till eight or nine o'clock at night - I was away once; I had nothing but intermediate beer, and only paid 9d. - I was perfectly sober; the picture was not in paper - I do not mean to say there is any sterling value in it, but I would not sell it under ten guineas - I should charge a gentleman twelve guineas for it; it cost me that, in time, to get it up.</p>

            . I keep the lower part of this house - it belongs to my uncle; I do not pay any rent - my uncle gave me an opportunity to try it, as the last occupier could not make it do; the whole house belongs to my uncle, and he lets out the other part, but does not live there himself. On the 4th of June, just before eight o'clock in the evening, I went to look after my glasses and pots - I immediately missed the picture, which I had seen laying before Jones in the early part of the day; I told him of it: I saw the prisoner go away before I missed it - Jones was about a yard and a half from where it had laid, when I told him of his loss; I sleep in the house.</p>
               <p>ROBERT GILES. I am a pawnbroker, living in Greek-street, Soho. On Saturday, the 4th of June, between nine and ten o'clock, this picture was pawned with me for 14s., in the name of Richard Good - I believe it was by the prisoner, but cannot be sure of him - it was Saturday, and there were a great many people in the shop; I asked if it was his own property - he said it was, that he merely wanted 14s., as it would be easier for him to get out, and if he wanted to leave it he should ask 30s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. It is not at all unusual to pawn property in a wrong name? A. No; we had a great many customers, and I did not take particular notice of the man - I do not say I am certain of him; I believe him to be the man - I think I could get 5l. for this picture.</p>
               <p>J. H. JONES re-examined. On missing my picture I did not require that the person in the house should be searched - only the prisoner had gone out; I thought it was done out of a lark - I gave him in charge on the following morning.</p>
               <p>Q. If he took it he returned and remained there, I understand, for an hour? A. I do not know that I was in his company so long as that - he at that time was dressed in a blue butcher's frock; I think I left him in the house - I do not know where Bousfield lives; I had never seen him before, to my knowledge.</p>

On the 14th of June, about eight o'clock at night, I went out to sell some apparel - I locked my door; I came home at half-past one o'clock in the morning, and as I came along the back passage, I found a lot of things under my feet - I had entered at the back door, which was locked when I went out, but I found it broken open; I found under my feet some coats, waistcoats, and trousers - four times as many as are here; I had left some of them hanging on lines in the kitchen, but more on shelves - I proceeded into my kitchen, and said, "Who is here?" the prisoner answered,"It is me, John, that has come in before you;" he had worked in my place at the tayloring business for the last six months, but had no business there then - he had left work about seven o'clock, and was to come again on the Monday; I sang out to Sellers, who lives in the shop over me, that there was a thief in my kitchen - Sellers came down, undressed; a light was procured - he told me to take care of the prisoner, while he fetched a constable, but while he was gone, the prisoner escaped out of the front door; I knew his voice very well when he spoke - Sellers and the constable came to my place; they went in pursuit, and took him at the bottom of Monmouth-street - he had got in by forcing the staple out of the door; the constable has eight of the articles found in the passage -I am sure they are mine, and that they were in the kitchen when I went out that night.</p>

I went with Sellers at half-past one o'clock in the morning, to look after the prisoner, and found him about thirty yards from the prosecutor's door, among a crowd of people - he said,"What do you take me for?" I said, "On a charge of breaking open McCarthy's door;" he told me he knew that - when he came out, he said he would do for Sellers, McCarthy, and us, and that he would serve us out; I took him to the watch-house, and returned to McCarthy's - I found the greatest confusion in his room, and a quantity of clothes in the passage; I have brought five pairs of trousers, two waistcoats, and a coat here.</p>

            . I am a turnkey of the Fleet. On the 15th of April, between eleven and twelve o'clock in the morning, I saw the defendant Bailey at the entrance of the prison; he said he was waiting there for Mr. Marshal, a clerk in the warden's office, but as he did not see him, he thought I might answer his question; he then produced an office copy of causes against Gilbert Rotton, and asked if I would inform him in what Court the actions were - I made no reply; he then asked me if it was not in the Common Pleas - I gave no answer; he then said, "Oh, I see it is in the Common Pleas;" he then asked if I knew in what situation Rotton was in, if he had not applied to the Court for the Relief of Insolvent Debtors - I said I believed he had; he then asked if there had not been a remand to produce further evidence before the Court - I said I believed that was the fact; he then asked if I thought it was possible to supersede the action - I said I thought a Judge was the best to decide that question - he said they were about superseding the action, and we might expect the discharge down in a very short time; that is all that passed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know any thing of Rotton or Ivey, before Rotton was committed? A. I know nothing of Rotton; I have seen Ivey coming backwards and forwards - I have been a turnkey two years - a great many persons act, in the Fleet, as agents in the Insolvent Court; I know nothing of their practising in other Courts to get discharges; I know nothing of Bailey practising in that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300101"/>way; Moody acted as a messenger in the Fleet, between prisoners and their friends.</p>

            . I am deputy-warden of the Fleet. On the 15th of April this parchment was brought to me by Foulkes, the turnkey - I declined taking it on account of its not having the official seal, and not being property drawn up; it was brought to me by Ivey in about half an hour, with an impression on the back, which it had not before - I understood him that he had got it sealed at the Prothonotary's office; I suspected it was not a regular document, and took it to the Prothonotary's office - Mr. Sherwood came back with me, and Ivey said a clerk had got it sealed at the office in the Temple, and paid 2s. 8d. for it; Rotton was present, he demanded to be discharged, and offered his fees - he was detained.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that is the parchment - have you had it ever since? A. I have not - it is the document originally produced, by the seal and appearance altogether; I can swear to it by the drawing up and the impression on the back - it has been part of the time in my custody; I gave it to Mr. Maule, the solicitor of the Treasury, a few days after - I have seen it several times since; Ivey did not say whose clerk had got it sealed - I knew nothing about Bailey at that time; he was afterwards taken into custody by Ivey, and brought before a Magistrate - that was the first time I heard of him; I then heard he was the clerk who got it sealed - I think Ivey stated, in Bailey's presence, before the Magistrate, that Bailey had got it sealed, and he paid him the money for it- I believe Rotton was supersedable.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you delivered the parchment to Mr. Maule, was Bailey present? A. I believe he was - I do not think, upon recollection, that Bailey was supercedable, as he had given notice under the Insolvent Act - he was bailable.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was any application made by either of the defendants for him to be admitted to bail? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. SHERWOOD. I am in the Prothonotary's office. This writ has nothing to do with the Court of Common Pleas one of the seals on it are those of our office; it is not under the seal of the Common Pleas, which it purports to be- the seal here is feigned altogether; the writ is informal, and the seals counterfeit: Sir N. C. Tyndall, whose seal it purports to be under, is a Judge of the Common Pleas, and not of the Exchequer - the defendant was detained under process from the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>MR. EARLE addressed the Court and Jury on behalf of Rotton and Ivey.</p>
               <p>Bailey. I believe you will find on the depositions that Ivey swore he never paid me a farthing - I deny ever seeing Rotton in my life, and Ivey but once or twice, and that in the presence of Moody, who they employed to do the business; it appears the whole of this is laid to my charge- I declare I am as innocent as a child unborn; Rotton promised last Session to provide me a Counsel, but now the blame is laid on my shoulders.</p>

            . My husband is a prisoner in the Fleet -Rotton lived in our room in April last. On the 14th of April Ivey was sent for, by Moody, the messenger - he came between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, on the 15th, and Rotton told him he was going to be bailed out, that he had employed Moody, the messenger, about it, with some solicitor outside, who was to do it - he asked Ivey to lend him a little money, as he was very short, and wanted money to pay his fees as he went out; he did not give him any then - Moody came between eleven and twelve o'clock, brought a piece of parchment, and said,"I have brought your discharge, Mr. Rotton;" he said,"Have you?" Moody said, "You must let me have a lit<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300102"/>tle money, Mr. Rotton;" Rotton asked Ivey to lend him some - Ivey said, "How much do you want?" Rotton said 10s. - Moody had asked Rotton for 10s.; Ivey lent Rotton the 10s., and he gave it to Moody - Moody said, "This makes 1l." - Rotton said, "Yes, you have had 1l. now;" Moody said, "This is your discharge, and you must take it down to the gate," upon which Rotton went away with it; he returned in a short time, alone - Moody was not there then, but he came back again in about half an hour with the parchment, and said, "Now it is all right, and here is your copy of causes;" one was a piece of writingpaper, and the other a parchment - I cannot say whether it was the same parchment as he brought the first time; he said he must take it down to the gate again, and he would wait for him outside; Moody went out, and I did not see him any more - Rotton went down, came back again, and said he had been to the gate, and it was not right; he told Mr. Sharp and me so - Rotton desired Ivey to go out himself, and see the solicitor, to see him righted; Ivey had been out of the room, and come back - I do not know where he had been; they had gone down together with the parchment, but I do not know where they went: Ivey had come back before Rotton came and said it was not all right.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Rotton live in your room the whole three months that he was there? A. Yes; I did not sleep in the prison; Mr. Peel and another person lived in the same room with my husband: they were not in the room when this took place - I had often seen Ivey and Rotton together; I never saw Bailey till I saw him here; I have not seen Moody since the 15th of April - Ivey is a carpenter; Rotton's father is a solicitor, I believe - his father never came to see him to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>MR. EARLE. Q. You frequently saw Ivey and Rotton together? A. Yes, several times the week before; Ivey used to come every two or three days, and bring him victuals and what he wanted, also money.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say Rotton desired Ivey to go to the solicitor, and see him righted - was the solicitor's name mentioned? A. Yes, it was; he did not know the name: he told him to go to the solicitor - I never heard the name nor where he lived; I never inquired.</p>

             was the first witness against him; he was remanded till the following Monday, at his own request, and on the 2nd of May he was brought before Mr. Alderman Venables; Ivey appeared on that day, but was not sworn; I read the evidence to the Alderman, and he ordered Ivey into custody.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was ordered into custody? A.He was ordered to find bail, and did so, after the first examination.</p>
               <p>Bailey's Defence (written.) It must appear very strange that Moody is not prosecuted; but the reason is very plain, for the defendants and Moody are endeavouring to throw the blame on me, who was no party in the transaction. The only evidence which concerns me, is that of the turnkley, who swears that I asked him a great many questions respecting Rotton, and how he was to be discharged - but the turnkey's evidence is very much in favour of me; for if I were a party concerned, why should I ask the turnkey questions, and thus create suspicions? Why could I not ask Rotton or Moody? If I had asked them, they could have given me the same information as the turnkey; and therefore I could only have asked the turnkey to satisfy myself that there was no fraud in the transaction, and from a determination not to be concerned in a transaction contrary to law, The defendants counsel throws all the blame on me, to exculpate his clients, but yet he disclaims all knowledge of me in this transaction, and states not that I was to get the writs sealed, but that a clerk of a solicitor was to go to the Prothonotary's. I became acquainted with Moody by visiting two builders named Ward and Richardson, confined in the prison; for whom Moody was accustomed to carry messages, and he asked me to do this for him; and in order that it should be quite correct, I asked the turnkey the questions which he has stated. You will observe that the clerk at Guildhall states that I was remanded at my own request, that I might produce the persons implicated in the transaction.</p>

Yes, he had; he had on the same day taken some goods to Mr. Maitland, in Bryanstone-square, about two or three o'clock - he rendered this account to me about seven or eight in the evening; the persons in the shop give in what they receive as soon as the customer is gone - but they give an account in the evening of what they have received in the course of the day - I saw the prisoner write this account in pencil;

               <p>MR. BARRY to MR. HAINES. Q. I believe you took the prisoner from the Emporium, in Greek-street, Soho? A. Yes - I had a character with him; I know that he did wait on Miss Doyle - I do not know that the sales were made on three different days; some bands and some stockings were sold at the counter, and they are not accounted for in the bill delivered to my daughter - they were taken home on the second day; I understand from the prisoner that part of the palmyrene was sold on the first day, which was the 14th of June, and part on the next day - my nephew,

               <p>COURT. Q. When the stockings were delivered at the counter was any bill made? A. Miss Doyle looked at some there - she selected some, and some we had to procure for her, which were sent to her; what she selected at the shop she would not have a bill of parcels made for, till she had the other articles, and would have to pay for them altogether - he would not account for them on the 14th; the check he gives to the cashier, with the money he pays in.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner on the 15th of June - I found 1l. 9s. 7d. on him, and this bill of 4l. 3s. 7d; he gave it me out of his pocket - his master said that was what he wanted him for.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long address, stated that his paving less than he received was quite a mistake, occasioned by the lady having made purchases at different times, which he should have discovered in correcting the books, and would have paid; and that there were constant mistakes made by other shopmen.</p>
               <p>MR. HAINES re-examined. Q.Is it the habit of your house to account at night? A. Yes, to see whether the shopmen's books agree with the cashier's, and with the checks they have given - if there were any errors there they would be rectified, but that would only refer to having a check too much or too little; I did not call on the prisoner to give any explanation of this - I told him what he was taken for, and he said I should find myself mistaken.</p>

The prisoner first came to me about three months after last Easter twelve months; he said he knew all the transaction between me and Stapleton, and if I did not give him money, as well as I had Stapleton, he would tell my father that I had robbed him - the first time I saw Stapleton he came,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300104"/>and said he was in great distress: I lent him 1s.; he said he would pay me again, and told me not to tell my father of it; he came the next morning, and said if I did not let him have another 1s. he would tell my father what I had done; I gave him another 1s. - he came the following morning, and said if I did not give him half a crown he would tell my father; he continued to come for about three months; sometimes every morning in the week, and sometimes he would omit a day or two - the smallest sum he ever had was 1s.; the prisoner afterwards came, and had money in the same way; I remember giving him a sovereign, about the 27th of February; he said if I did not give it him he would tell my father I had robbed him; I got that sovereign from the cash-box, when I went with the key to get change - I gave the sovereign to the prisoner in Princes-street; I did not tell him where I got it - he had come in the early part of the morning to my father's house, and asked for it; I took it out of the cash-box, about nine o'clock - I met him about six in the evening, and gave it him, about three hundred yards from my father's; I was to meet him on the pier-head, but as I was going on an errand I met him in Princes-street; he asked if I had got it - I told our pot-boy, who was with me, to step aside, and I gave the prisoner the sovereign; the potboy was not near enough to see what passed - there was a boy named Lewis at the end of the street, right opposite to us; the prisoner always knew where I got the money from.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What money I had of him was to buy things for him; I did not have it myself. Witness. All I had of him was a plane, a hammer, and a small pocket-pistol; I gave him altogether about 25l.</p>

            . I took the prisoner. I said it was for inducing young Pink to rob his father - he said he knew nothing about him; I found this paper on him, and the duplicate of a musical snuff-box - I asked how he got this paper; he said he picked it up in Wapping, and he bought the snuff-box of Mr. Howard.</p>
               <p>The paper being read was scarcely legible, but related to something about the prosecutor's son giving money away, and was directed to the prosecutor.</p>

Six or eight months; I should not have been afraid to have left my watch in your care; I did not give it you to take care of - when I saw you on the Wednesday I said"You know what I want," and you said, "You shall have it on Saturday;" I waited till Saturday; you did not say you had pawned it - I was to meet you at the Thornhill's Arms; I should not have known you had the watch, had not two men come, and told - I waited till the Saturday, and as it did not come I began to think rather serious about it; I was the worse for liquor.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I met the prosecutor - we went, and drank together: we then went to the Vine, and drank a great deal more - he was very tipsy, I was rather better; I advised him to go home, but he would go to the Pickled Egg; I said he had better allow me to take care of his watch, and he said very well - I took it, and went my way; that was about two o'clock in the morning - I did not go home; I took a lodging, and the next morning I was obliged to pawn the watch to pay for the lodging - I went to the Vine the next morning to say where he might come to me, and that his watch was all right; he came on the Wednesday, and said "Do you know where my watch is?" I told him.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 26th of May I went with the prosecutrix to the prisoner's shop, and in a box outside the door, I found this book, marked 1s.; the prosecutrix said it was hers - I said to the prisoner,"I shall take this book as part of Mrs. Keith's property;" he said, "Oh, my God, how can you say it is yours? I bought it of a woman four days ago, and I can prove it;" I said, "Well, you must bring your proof before the Magistrate to-morrow morning, at eleven o'clock;" he said he could easily do that - I took the book, but as he seemed so positive I did not take him then; I found no other property of the prosecutrix's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not do every thing in my power to show you every part of my premises? A. You opened the door, and said you had no property that you knew of.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was an officer in his late Majesty's service, but having been unfortunate, I was forced to go into business to support a large family; I never purchased an article knowing it to be stolen - as soon as I found it was dangerous to buy goods of this description I never let boys come into my place, and for the last three months a boy has never been into my place; if a prosecution of this nature was to be allowed we should never be safe - it is one of the most cruel that can be instituted: here is a boy steals a book from his mistress and brings it to me - I give to the utmost value of it, then he goes and says, "I took it to such a shop, and they bought<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300109"/>it," and the prosecutor will excuse the thief to bring the receiver into disgrace, and perhaps deprive him of liberty; if it shall please you to acquit me, as I find the danger of following this business, I shall lay it aside - what I have experienced here is the as plus ultra of misery in body and mind; I happened to purchase this - you see what it has brought me to, through the ipse dixit of this boy.</p>

I took the prisoner to the office - in going along he offered me a sovereign; at least he pretended to do it; he held his hand down, and said, "There is not one coming, take it, and I will soon he out of the way;" when I got him to Marlborough-street he ran away, put I pursued, and took him - he acknowledged at the office that he had done it.</p>

On the 30th of June I was in Gray's Inn-lane, between two and three o'clock in the morning; I had spent the evening with a friend, and drank a little, but knew what I was about - I was going home; the prisoner accosted me, and asked me to walk with her - I walked with her; I went out of my way - in a quarter of an hour I was about leaving her, and felt my money was gone from my breeches pocket- it was thirteen shillings and a half-crown; I am sure it was safe when I met her - I accused her of robbing me; she denied it, and said she had no money about her, that I must have made a mistake - I laid hold of her arm; a constable came up, and I gave her in charge - as she went to the station-house I saw my money drop from her pockets; I am sure she said she had no money about her- I had taken no liberties with her.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DUNSFORD. I am a Policeman. I was on duty, and saw the prisoner and prosecutor - he charged her with robbing him of 15s. 6d.; I asked what she had done with the money - she said she had no money but 2d., but when we had got about a hundred yards towards the station she put her left-hand into the pocket-hole of her gown; I said, "Keep your hand from your pocket" - as I drew her hand out a half-crown and six shillings dropped on the ground; she then began to kick and be disorderly - I was obliged to hold her arms; I got my fellow-officer to pick the money up - she fell down in struggling, and seven shillings more dropped from her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man met me, and asked if I was going home - he put his hand across my shoulder; I had the money in my bosom - he said, "You have got money;" I said, "That is immaterial to you" - he asked where I lived; I said he could not see me home - he walked with me to the middle of Laystall-street, and gave me a shove; the Policeman came up, and he gave me in charge, but said he did not know what money he had lost- he dragged me along, and the money being in my bosom, the string of my gown broke and it fell; his pocket had a hole in it, so that he could not have money in it.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BIRKENSHAW. I am chief mate of the Ruth. The prisoner was quite a stranger - he might have been on board; the property produced was in my chest in the cabin, which was locked, but not the chest - he broke open the sky-light.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

The prosecutor called for a pint of beer - he went into the taproom to light his pipe; while he was there the prisoner came to the bar, and called for three halfpenny worth of gin, which he drank and went towards where the budget was - he returned and went out, with the budget under his left arm; when the prosecutor complained, I told my husband what I had seen, and he was taken in five minutes, but the property has not been found - I had seen the prisoner several times, and am quite sure he is the man; I knew the budget - the prosecutor usually leaves it at our house after he has done work.</p>

               <p>SARAH HOW. My husband is a wine-cellar man. On the 28th of June, about eleven o'clock in the morning, I went out to market, and saw the prisoner in Whitechapel-market; the boys in the market were using her ill - I told them to go home, and asked where she lived; she said in Petticoat-lane, and that her husband was a drover - I took her into <placeName id="t18310630-242-crimeloc1273">Petticoat-lane</placeName>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutrix gave me an account of this - her eye was badly bruised and puffed out; she described the woman to me - I knew where to find her, and found her in bed about twelve o'clock that day, in a room in New-court, Wentworth-street - she had some of her things off; I found no money on her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please to call my witnesses.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM -. I keep the King of Prussia, in Petticoat-lane. The prisoner and prosecutrix came into my house on the morning this happened, about eleven o'clock- they were both a little in liquor; they called for a quartern of gin, which I served them with - after that they had a pint of beer together; I did not hear a word mentioned about a robbery - the prisoner had a basket of eels, which she was taking home to clean, (I suppose, as she sold eels;) I saw they had both had liquor enough, and would not serve them more - they had not had quite enough when they came in; they were intoxicated - they seemed very good friends; after I told them to go away the prosecutrix endeavoured to take the eels from the prisoner, and in the scuffle the prosecutrix received the blow - I got between and separated them, and got my shirt torn; I put one out at one door and the other at the other - the prisoner's husband took her home, and the prosecutrix remained at my house for half an hour - the prisoner said the man was her husband; I have occasionally seen him pass my door - they fought in my house: there was no pretence for money being taken away - she received the blow in the eye in my house.</p>
               <p>SARAH HOW. I never was in his house in my life, nor in any house with that woman - the Policeman can tell whether I was intoxicated.</p>
               <p>Witness. It was an hour and a half after it was done that the Policeman took the prisoner - when she went outside my door I heard her say she had lost 3s. 6d.; she told the officer it was 13s. 6d.</p>

            . I am a journeyman shoemaker. I had seen the prisoner in the house the first time he called; I heard of this loss, and saw him in Oxford-market - I asked how he did; he said, "Oh, how do you do? When did you see Mrs. Owen?" I said, "Not since the Sunday I saw you there;" we walked as far as far as Foley-place - he said he was going to call on a gentleman, and he should get some money, and if I would wait he would treat me; I said I could stand a glass if he would come in - he would not; I collared him, and asked where the watch was - he tore himself form me, and said, "Oh, come with me," and away he ran; I followed and caught hold of his coat - the pocket came off; he then said it was all right, that the pocket was full of duplicates, and he would give me the ticket and make it all right - I secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you first mention about his saying he would give you the ticket? A. At the office - he never mentioned the watch: I do not live with my father - he did not turn me out of doors: he quarrelled with me for keeping idle company - I left his house; he did not say I should live at home - I dropped the skirt of the prisoner's coat; I did not examine to see if there were duplicates in it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing whatever of what I am accused of - I declare I never said there were duplicates in my pocket, or that I would settle it; I told him I was known in the neighbourhood, and would go before a Magistrate with him, if he had any thing against me, but he pulled me about, and tore my coat - I ran because I should not be exposed; I went into my house, and told my wife, then came out, and went to the office - three parts of the evidence is false: when I met her in the street she asked if my name was Brown, and if I did not live with Lord Dundas - having lived with him at Lisbon, I said Yes; as to going to St. John's-wood, I was going for some work for my wife - I returned to the spot in about twenty minutes, and she was gone; being married, I thought it best to decline further visits; they thought I had a good situation, as I freely spent money with them - the first evening I went there Mrs. Owen said her husband lived on the Continent - people who live in the house can, prove no watch was ever seen on the mantel-piece - the first Sunday I went to tea there, this witness came out of Mrs. Owen's bed-room in his shirt-sleeves, and he was in: the bed-room on the first floor the same day; the evening the watch was taken there was a man in the bed-room, for there was a hat and coat there - this young woman took cups and saucers into the bed-room for two persons.</p>
               <p>MRS. OWEN. My husband is butler in a nobleman's family; there was not a soul in my place - I was sitting in a chair and laying on the bed, being ill, but the watch was in the front room - there was no hat or coat in the room; I have lodgers, but they are respectable.</p>

The two prisoners came to the White Lion public-house, called for two pints of beer, and paid for them both with farthings; several persons drank with them - they had a Scotch cap with halfpence in it, and appeared to be dividing them; our house is nearly a quarter of a mile from the prosecutor's - I was shutting up soon after, and they were then sitting on the steps of the next house, and appeared to be dividing a great quantity of halfpence.</p>

I met two men in Clare-market, who had been to sea with me; they took me to a gin-shop, gave me something to drink, and in the market I bought these books of a man standing at the corner of Houghton-street - I went home for two hours, and on coming out again offered them for sale.</p>

            . I keep a chandler's shop, in Widegate-alley, Bishopsgate-street. On the 1st of June, between nine and ten o'clock in the evening, the female<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300118"/>prisoner came and asked for half a quartern loaf - I was at the back part of the shop; my wife gave her the loaf, which came to 4d. - she offered a base shilling; my wife took it up, and said, "This is bad," and returned it to her - the prisoner put it into her mouth, and said it was bad, that she knew where she took it, and would go back, to see if they would change it; she went out, leaving the loaf behind - I followed her, and in Bishopsgate-street, she went up to the male prisoner, who was standing at the corner of Widegate-street, looking up the street, the way the woman was coming down; they joined - I was three or four yards off, and could not hear their conversation; I saw the hand of one go to the other - something appeared to pass from the woman to the woman; they then turned towards Bishopsgate church - I followed, and in the pursuit they stopped and conversed two or three times in the space of a hundred yards; they stopped again at the end of Rose-alley, and just at that time Sapwell came by - we followed them up Rose-alley, to the Rose public-house - they stopped at the door; Sapwell directly caught hold of Edwards' hand - he 
               <persName id="t18310630-255-person1849">drew</persName>
             a shilling from it, and said, "This is a bad shilling, we will take them into the house, and search them further;" I had taken the woman - we took them into a room at the Rose; Sapwell took Edwards to a table to search him - a good shilling and some coppers were found on him; Sapwell then said to the woman, "Come, let me search you;" she said she would not be searched by him, but he caught hold of her, drew her to the table, and just at the place where she stood, I saw something white - it might be two or three feet from where Edwards was searched; I got another light, stooped down, and picked up a piece of cloth; it felt heavy, and was just twisted round, not fastened - I handed it to the officer, and saw it opened; it was ten base shillings, which Sapwell took charge of.</p>

               <p>Eastbrook. Q.They were as near the young man as me? A. No; I think they were three feet from where he had been - he did not pass her; Sapwell took him to the right - if any thing had passed from her to the man, in the house, I think I must have observed it.</p>
               <p>Edwards. Q. Did you not swear before the Alderman that it was the shilling which Eastbrook had offered your wife? A. No; I said I could not tell.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q.Where were you? A. At the back of the shop; I could not see what she tendered, but heard what passed.</p>
               <p>THOMAS SAPWELL. I am a constable. I was on duty; Skinner came to me between nine and ten o'clock, and I watched the prisoners into Rose-alley - at the door of the Rose I ran up, seeing them close together, and took a counterfeit shilling from Edwards' hand; I marked it - this is it; I took them into the parlour, and on Edwards found a good shilling and 2d. or 3d. - I put it on the table, and he made a scramble for it, saying, "Don't take my money;" Eastbrook was standing just behind me - Skinner said, "Here is something down here," and picked it up - it contained ten bad shillings; I do not think there were three yards space between us all - we were pretty close together; on the way to the Compter Eastbrook said, "The shilling found in the man's hand, was the shilling which he gave to me."</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN FIELD. I am an inspector of counterfeit coin. This shilling is counterfeit, and cast from Britannia metal; the other ten are also counterfeit, and the whole eleven are cast in the same mould.</p>
               <p>Eastbrook delivered in a written defence, stating, that the male prisoner had given her the shilling to purchase him a loaf, and at the public-house had contrived to throw the 10s. down near her.</p>

            . I am a watchman of St. Andrew's. On the 8th of June, about half-past nine o'clock at night, I saw the prisoners together in Shoe-lane; the man had a child in his arms - they were both so intoxicated as not to be able to take care of it; I asked the man to deliver it to me, and I would take him to the watch-house, to protect him and the child, which he objected to, at first, but at last gave the child into my arms; a number of people collected - a woman took the child from me, to take care of it; the man resisted - I took him by the collar, and he dropped a half-crown and a shilling, which I produce; he was very near the

             - the female prisoner was about half-a-dozen paces from him; they were apart when he dropped the money - I am sure it dropped from him; he put his foot on the half-crown, but could not reach the shilling - I did not know it was bad, and wished to put it into my pocket to take care of for him, but he resisted my taking it up; I got assistance - Rentmore took charge of the woman; I saw some coin taken from the woman, but did not count it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long have you been a watchman? A.Between four and five years - there might be sixty or a hundred persons, or two hundred about - I cannot say, as I was engaged; I cannot say whether it was a fine night or not - it was not raining when he dropped the money; if it did, I do not recollect it; the lamps were lighted - I expect to be paid for attending here, but do not know how much: I have only been a witness once before - I do not know what that was about; it was concerning base coin.</p>
               <p>MR. ELLIS. Q.How far was the man from the crowd, when he dropped the money? A. The crowd had not collected till after he dropped it; there is a lamp by Messrs. Pontifex's building - I could see perfectly well.</p>

I took the female prisoner to the watch-house, and found and old stocking in her bosom, inside her gown, containing a quantity of bad coin, amounting to 7l. 10s. 6d. - I turned it out, and said it was all bad; she directly said, "I know it is all bad, and I got it all bad."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She was quite sober? A. No, she was drunk; there were about fifty persons present when I took her - she claimed the child at the watch-house,</p>

            . I am ward-beadle, of St. Andrew's. The prisoner were brought to the watch-house - I observed Boyle's breast very bulky, and told Rent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300119"/>more to search her; she resisted very much - he drew from her bosom this stocking, containing thirteen crowns, seven half-crowns, and sixty-eight shillings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you find any thing else on her? A. No; I found about 7l. 6s. in good money on the man, but no bad money.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. The whole of the money found on Boyle is counterfeit; the shilling and half-crown produced, are also counterfeits - they are all of the same metal; the halfcrown appears to be from the same mould as the others - the shillings are three different impressions.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe these two metals are different? A. They are precisely alike, but one has undergone a preparation to fit it better for circulation, to imitate money which is worn and greasy.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you search the house in Wentworth-street? A. No; I did not go in- I had not known the prisoner before; I am sure I am not mistaken in his person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. This money would have been more safe in your pocket? A. Yes; the man ran with his back towards me, but he turned his face two or three times - I did not say I could not swear to the prisoner; I said it was a very serious thing to swear to a man, but I had no doubt upon my mind - I only meant that there was a possibility of a doubt.</p>

            . On the 3rd of May I went with Kingston to No. 55, Wentworth-street - I went into the house, and inquired below who was up stairs; they said a woman who lay in, and that was all - this was about four o'clock in the afternoon; I looked through the crack of a door, and saw two persons lying in bed - I went in, turned down the bed, and found the prisoner in bed with a female - he had all his clothes and his shoes on, and so had the female; they had both been under the clothes - I brought the prisoner down stairs, and asked Kingston to look at him - the prisoner said he was in bed in consequence of his shirt being washed; he had no shirt on - I had got from Kingston a description of the man I was in search of, and the prisoner's appearance corresponded with that; I took the prisoner up to Whitechapel - I had another with me, and as we were going up the passage of the office Mr. Braduack pointed to the prisoner, and said, "That is the man;" I said, "You must be very particular, it is a very serious thing;" he walked up and down the passage two or three times, looked at the prisoner again, and said, "I am confident that is the man;" he persisted in asserting that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I dare say the gentleman described him as a man without a shirt? A. No, Sir; the prosecutor said that it was a serious thing to swear to a man, and so did I - the prisoner went with us to Whitechapel, in custody; I cannot say whether it had struck four o'clock - it was a short time after the prosecutor alleged he had lost his bundle - I searched the house, but found nothing belonging to the prosecutor; the woman who was in bed was Elizabeth Hall, I believe - she was taken and discharged.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q.Do not you think it is a long forty yards from your shop to the corner? A. I think it is about that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why did not you take any steps to take the man? A. It is a dangerous place, I might have been knocked down - I saw no one about; my life would not have been safe - if there had been any Policemen about I would have tried to have stopped him, but it would have been madness without; I think it was between two and three o'clock - there were two or three men round the gig; I knew them by sight - the first thing I saw was the man who took the bundle made some remark to the gentleman in the gig, as it stood at the Two Brewers - the streetkeeper was going by, and he ran past me; he watched the street-keeper past, and then went and took the bundle - he passed me, and ran down George-yard.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Was the gig in Brick-lane or Wentworth-street? A. The horse's head was towards Brick-lane, and the chaise in Wentworth-street - he took the bundle from behind the chaise, and ran; Hall's husband is a carpenter.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Did he not come out of George-street again? A. I did not see him - he walked gently when he took it; the gentleman called Stop that man! or Stop thief! I do not know which; I did not observe the man look round - I did not see any one go into No. 55, Wentworth-street; I do not know which is 55 - the man who took the bundle had got as far as the City of Norwich public-house when the gentleman missed it, and called out; I lodge in Montague-street.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Your money had been taken before Lattan came up? A.

               <p>Williams. I met him and three more gentlemen's servants - he came up to me, and I said "Let me alone;" he took hold of me in a very rude way - I fell down, he fell upon me, and the servants laughed at us; Lattan then came up, and said "Is there no one to take this young woman's part?" I called out Police! and the Policeman came up; the prosecutor then said he had been robbed - Lattan said, "I don't think you are robbed;" he said,"There is something chinks;" and she said, "I dare say it is what is in my handkerchief;" the officer took us to the watch-house, and asked him what he had lost - he said he could not say; Lattan said there was a half-crown, three shillings, and two sixpences in her handkerchief.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe she claimed it as her own? A. Yes; the prosecutor at first said he had been robbed of all he had got; I asked him what pieces of money they were, and he said he did not know, except one half crown; I found one half-crown, two shillings, and three sixpences<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300121"/>- I looked at the money in the street, but I did not tell him what there was; he might be two yards from me - he could not see it; Lattan all the time claimed it - Anchor did not say whether he had shillings or sixpences; he was standing when I came up to him, but he had the appearance of having been down; he said he fell in struggling to get the money from her hand - I did not observe any dirt on him; I knew Williams had been down by her hands being dirty- Lattan was asked what money she had, and she said 6s. 6d. in her handkerchief: that was after the prosecutor had said what he had lost - the inspector asked what coins they were, but he is not here; she could not tell him, but she said 6s. 6d. - there were four, five, or six persons present; Lattan had time, no doubt, to tie up the money in her handkerchief; it was full ten minutes before I went up - she must have had time to have seen what was in it.</p>
               <p>Williams. Q. Did not she say, "You will find a halfcrown piece, three shillings, and two sixpences in it," when she gave you the handkerchief? A. Yes: but there was a half-crown, two shillings, and three sixpences.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did she ask you that question? A. She did not specify the money exactly, not to my knowledge- I cannot swear it.</p>

               <p>Lattan's Defence. I had the money from a gentleman before; I then heard the cries of a female, saw Williams laying down, and the prosecutor on her - I said, "Is there no one to take the female's part?" the Policeman then came up, and the prosecutor said he had been robbed, but he did not know of what - he then said he heard something fall; I said, "Very likely you heard this;" I gave up the handkerchief, and told what money I had in it; I begged of him to go to a house which I had been to.</p>

On Sunday, the 5th of June, I went out in the afternoon, leaving the prisoner in charge, with a son of mine seven years old; I left the door which goes from the shop to the adjoining room closed, and fastened with a padlock - there was a chest of drawers in the adjoining room, which were locked; I left about a quarter before five o'clock, and returned a quarter before ten - the prisoner was then gone; the staple of the door between the shop and room was broken in two - the drawers had been forced open, and I missed some ear-rings from a cash-box in my drawer; I know there were three pairs, and I have understood from my wife there were four, also two watch-keys, and some copper in a paper.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH HIGGINS. I am a Police-constable. I received the prisoner into custody on the 10th of June - I did not say any thing to induce him to confess, but he told me he had been in the habit of meeting a sailor named Reynolds, at different times, and he had put him up to rob his master, that he had slept with the sailor that night in St. Giles, and he had carried off his waistcoat, with the ear-rings in the pocket of it - I think he said he had spent the copper; I believe he said there were 2s. worth, and a shirtcollar, and that he had sold in Petticoat-lane.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you could get me out of the scrape if I told you? A. No, I swear I did not -I asked what you had to say, and you told me that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>MR. SPICE. I left him in the house, and he had the key of the parlour to get into the passage - there was a long skewer in the shop, and I believe he broke the middle door, to get the skewer to break the drawers.</p>

On Saturday night, the 4th of June, I remember his coming to my shop for a truss of hay, about twenty minutes past eleven o'clock - he ordered it to be sent to his yard, at the Green Dragon, Worship-street; I objected to fetching it down that night, as I did not like to go up with a candle - he stopped till about twenty minutes or a quarter to twelve, as he remained to hear a woman singing; I can positively swear he was in my shop about that time - I live full two miles from the Adelphi.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What induced you to notice the time he stopped? A.Because I had just then given my man orders to shut up the shop; I am certain I am correct within five minutes.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What enables you to know when he came in? A. I know he was there full half an hour; I have a clock in the adjoining room, but it was too fast; I knew the time.</p>

            . I was examined on the part of this prosecutor, but was not before the Grand Jury; I am a carman, and live at No. 2, King's-road, Hoxton. I know the prisoner very well - I was with him on Saturday night, the 4th of June; I met him near twelve o'clock, about half way up Worship-street, and just before we got to the Baker and Basket, I saw two men with a horse and van - one was talking to the other about buying the van, but he went away just as we came up, and the prisoner asked the man what he wanted for it - I think he said 13l. or 14l.; the man who went away had a short smockfrock and trousers - the other had a smock-frock and white stockings; the man said he wanted to sell the van, and he had just parted with that man, as they could not deal - that he did not dare to take it home, fearing to have it seized for rent on the Monday morning; the prisoner ultimately agreed to purchase it for 10l.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL. Q. What did you hear the man say? A. He said he had a van to sell; I had never seen him before - they were both strangers; there was no name on the head of the van - I did not go to the off-side of it; I left them there dealing, within one hundred yards of the prisoner's yard - I told the prisoner, if I was him, I would not pay all the money till day-light; I saw no money paid - I left them walking towards his yard; there was a brown thick-looking horse in the van.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to fall in with the prisoner? A. I was going by - I thought he had come out of his own yard.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live at No. 1, Han'splace, Hoxton. On Saturday night, the 4th of June, I came out of Brick-lane into Old-street, which is threequarters of a mile from Worship-street; it was after eleven o'clock, and might be half-past - I saw two men with a van; they asked if I would buy a van - I said, No, that I had only a sovereign; they asked 13l. for it - I walked round it, and said it was not worth half the money; they said their landlord would seize it for rent on Monday, and sell it for what it would fetch.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. They were strangers to you? A. Yes; I was talking to Goddard and three or four men when they came up - I have known the prisoner five or six years; he has a stable in Worship-street, and lives at the corner of Finsbury-market - I was at Worship-street, and told young Armstrong what I had seen; he sent me into the office - I would not give more than 7l. or 8l. for the van; it was a light colour, the axletree and carriage was dark; the body was a lightish colour - not yellow nor white; it might have been yellow once, but was worn - it was a lightish yellow; I have seen a van here, but it is new done over now - I did not see the prisoner that night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is Brick-lane in the way from the Adelphi to Worship-street? A. I do not think it is the shortest way; it is out of the road - one of the men had a short frock, and long brown trousers; the other had white stockings, and high shoes - he was a stout man; there was a name on the cart, but I cannot read.</p>

            . I am a carman, and live in Europaplace, John's-row, St. Luke's. I was with Wise on Saturday night, the 4th of June, and saw two men with a van; they offered it for sale to Wise - I cannot exactly tell the time; it was ten o'clock, or between ten and eleven - I cannot be certain whether it was ten, eleven, or twelve; they said they expected an execution, and were forced to sell it to pay the rent.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How do you know it was the 4th of June? A.Because I took home bills for my work; I am not certain it was not eleven o'clock - I did not see the prisoner that night; I have known him about five or six years - there was a short punchey horse in the van, short and thick - I am sure it was not a white horse; I cannot say whether it was black - they asked him if he knew who wanted a van; he said he did not - that he had only a sovereign, if that would buy it, he had no objection; the man said he would not take less than 12l. or 14l. - I cannot read properly; I did not notice the colour of the van - it might have been black for what I know; it was not very close to me - I did not see Wise examine it much, for I was talking to Mr. Bedell, a builder, who I work for; I give receipts for money.</p>
               <p>Q. If you cannot read, how do you know the date by your bills? The man who keeps my book tells me the dates - his name is Taylor; I can tell figures - I delivered a bill to Mr. Bedell that day; I did not observe any figures on the van - I heard nothing of this till Thursday, (a month ago to-morrow,) when the gate-keeper at the gas-works said Whiting was taken up for buying a van; I said there was a van offered for sale on Saturday night - he said that was the time he bought it; I do not know that I have ever spoken to the prisoner - I was never in his house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.How far do you live from Old-street? A.About three hundred yards - I cannot say at what time I got home; I stopped and drank with Bedell and Wise, and then Wise went home - we were not many minutes at the public-house; I had been to Burke, in Cooper's-court, for some money.</p>

            . I live at No, 18, Crown-street, Soho, and keep a horse and cart; I heard Christie say he did not think it was any body who worked about the premises, or he should have known him again.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to Christie? A. No; I went to my stable about six o'clock in the morning, and saw him - I never told his father he should have 4l., 5l., or 6l., if he kept his son out of the way, nor any thing of the kind - I move furniture with my cart.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q.How far is your stable from where the van is kept? A. About the length of this Court - I do not know the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to go to Christie's father? A. Because some word was uttered under the place that was false - the prisoner's wife sent to me; I went up with them, and they told me what the business was.</p>
               <p>- CHRISTIE, SEN. I am Christie's step-father. I would not believe Isaacs on his oath; what he has stated is all false - I know his character.</p>

            . I was secretary to the Potosi La Paz, and Peruvian Mining Association, which was established in London. I have not belonged to it this four years - the object of the Association was to work mines in Peru; the capital was divided into shares, which were bought and sold in the money-market - this paper (looking at it) is a genuine share; there were printed receipts for the scrip, but this is the instrument on which divedends would be payable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q.You have neither Charter nor Act of Parliament to authorize your proceedings? A. No; the Association may consist of one thousand persons or two thousand for what I know; the office is in Great Winchester-street - the Association is governed by twelve directors, self-elected, and the money was paid to the bankers on account of the directors; the amount collected was 60,000l., as near as I can recollect - I do not think it was 100,000l.; I should say between 70,000l. and 80,000l. - the sums were subscribed in 1825; no dividend has been paid - there is no money remaining at the bankers', that I am aware of; there are deeds - I do not know where they are, as I am not now connected with the Association; I believe the shares are still circulating on the Stock Exchange - the mines are at Potosi, I understand; there was no deed of Association.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was it ever given out that there was a Charter or Act of Parliament establishing the Company? A. Never; great expence was incurred in sending out vessels - the money was entirely spent in the necessary expences of the Company; share-holders would certainly not be benefitted by fictitious shares in the market.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you the prosecutor of this indictment? A. It is not carried on at my expence - I do not know at whose expence it is done; I have heard that it is at the expence of Mr. Measam: time bargains have been done with these shares, but not on the Stock Exchange now - they were some time back; that is buying and selling a given number of shares to be taken at a stipulated future day - I am not aware of more being agreed for than can be delivered, because many bargains are almost immediately closed again, and the differences are paid; this may be called partly gambling.</p>
               <p>Q. On the day you agreed with Mr. Hayley for these shares, were you not obliged to wait some time till he could get them from other persons? A. I waited some time for him to produce them, but not long enough to constitute a time bargain - I should think any thing beyond a day would be a time bargain, but if they are delivered the day the bargain is made, I think it is a ready money transaction - time bargains are sales made for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300131"/>an account day; I agreed with a Mr. Costello for the shares - he referred me to Hayley, who was to produce a portion of them; they were delivered about four o'clock on the day I agreed for them - I swear that positively; it was a regular money transaction; I stated this at the Mansion-house - what I said was taken down; my deposition was read over to me, but all I said was not taken down.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q.Has Mr. Measam any fabricated shares in his possession? A. I have not seen any - this transaction was not a time bargain; the money was paid the same day; when I received the shares I received them as bona fide shares - I produced the cheque on Messrs. Jones and Loyd, which I paid him.</p>

            . I am a letter-press and copperplate printer, and live in the New-cut, Lambeth. I have known the defendant about two years; when I first knew him he gave the name of Smith. In March last, when I came home one day, I found him at my house - my young man had taken an order from him, and entered it in the name of Spicer and Co. - the prisoner then ordered me to engrave a plate like a copy which he had got - (looking at a share) it was as near like this as the engraver could do it; he said the former plate was lost, that Mr. Ellis, the engraver, had offended the gentlemen, and there would be a great many other things to be done - I was to engrave this as quick as I could; it had the name of Ellis, as the engraver, and was dated 1827 - I said it was copper-plate; he said Yes, but the plate was lost, and I was to do another; I got one engraved - a proof was thrown off, which I showed to him on paper at my house; he ordered one hundred to be engraved on parchment - I gave the plate, the whole hundred engravings, and the original they were copied from, all over to the defendant - I was paid 7l. for my trouble; I gave a receipt for the money, in the name of Spicer and Co., and delivered it to the defendant, as my young man entered the work to be done in that name - he made not the least objection to the receipt being in that name - (looking at nineteen impressions) I have no doubt these are all impressed from the same plate.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Have you been a speculator in these shares at all? A. No; I never saw Mr. Measam till about May, nor did my wife, to my knowledge - I was taken into custody about these plates; it was then I saw Mr. Measam - I was in custody four or five days till I could find the defendant; I was not in prison, but in a lock-up house at night, and went out with the officer in the day-time to find him - I was never in prison in my life; I was at the office about disposing of indecent prints, and paid the 20l. penalty for it - one of my apprentices was a witness against me; I have not been in trouble about any thing else - I go to Ascot races; you may have seen me there - I kept a "une deux cinq table;" I never said Mr. Measam employed me to engrave these shares -Barker, who superintends my business when I am out, was present when the defendant came; I did not say, at Unionhall, that nobody was present - he had spoken to Barber, but when I came in and took the business Barber left, and was at a little distance in the office when I took the order.</p>
               <p>Q. In the same room? No, the office is divided - there are two rooms, the press and composing-rooms; he left me with Mr. Hayley - he might have heard our conversation if he had paid attention to it; I do not know whether he did; he might have heard part of it - my wife was at home - she works in the business, and saw the defendant; I believe she was in the kitchen - she was about the premises; I cannot say whether she was in the office or not, but she saw him - she was backwards and forwards; he was dressed in a very dark olive or black surtout coat, and wore glasses - I do not know any thing about Mr. Measam.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I think I prosecuted you about the papers? A. Yes; I never saw Measam till he took me into custody in May; I never did any work for him - all the while I was in custody I was about with the officer, by direction of the Magistrate, looking for the defendant, and my wife went about at different periods; the defendant pointed out Ellis' name to me on the engraving.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Are you certain the defendant is the man? A. Certainly - he did not tell me where he lived.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you first know the defendant by the name of Hayley? A. The day he was taken he gave that name - Mr. Measam called him Hayley when he took him; I never knew him by that name before.</p>
               <p>CHARLES FREDERICK BARBER. I am journeyman to Mr. Peel. I first saw the defendant in March last - he came to the office to have a plate engraved for the Potosi Association; Mr. Peel was not at home when he came in- he showed me a copy on parchment, similar to this(looking at one); I declined giving him an estimate of the price till Mr. Peel came in, as I did not know the price of engraving - I asked if he would leave his name; he gave me Spicer and Co.; our office is in the back premises below, and as I was shewing him up stairs, I met master - the conversation between them was not exactly in my hearing, for the office where we work has a deal of bustle in it; I did not bear what passed - I saw him leave in about ten minutes; as far as I can recollect, he wore a frock coat, and wore glasses - I saw him again four or five days after, when he came to our house to see a proof of the plate; I was not present when it was shown to him, nor did he say any thing to me about it - I know the engraving had been done then; I saw him again on the Saturday in the same week, when he came to fetch them away - I think it was the same day as he saw the proof; he took away the impressions, which were on parchment, the plate, and the copy it was engraved from - I did not see him pay any thing, and did not see him again till he was apprehended; I am quite sure he is the person.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300132"/>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q.Can you give us the day of the week that he first came? A. No - I know it was Saturday that he saw the proof, as there was a chimney on fire opposite; I cannot say which house - I have no other reason - it was about four or five o'clock; I have lived with Peel about nine months - I did not notice the colour of the defendant's glasses; he had a dark coat, inclining to brown - I know his features, but did not examine him all over; I cannot say what cravat he wore - there were two more men at work in the office, about four yards from master, but you cannot hear while the press is going what persons in the counting-house are talking of, unless you chose to be inquisitive and listen; I cannot say how long these men had been in master's employ, nor recollect their names - they merely came to work a job off; there is a small partition to the counting-house, but still they might see the defendant - he did not pass them to go out; I did not ask the defendant where he lived, but it was asked, because I was desired to put down Stangate - I have the book here: I asked Mr. Peel if he had left his address - he said Stangate; master said he had told him where he lived - if he has said he did not ask him, he must have said an untruth to me, or to the gentleman who asked him, if he did: Mrs. Peel was going backwards and forwards in the office - I cannot say how near she was to him; she passed him, I believe - as far as I can recollect this was in the morning; it might be ten o'clock, or it might be three - the order was given and executed in March, but I cannot tell the day of the month.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were the two men in the office at press or composing? A.They were at press that day; it makes a great noise, and engages their attention - the counting-house is separated by a partition: the men were not in our constant employ - I saw the defendant at Unionhall, and had a doubt of him till I heard him speak, on account of his not having spectacles, but had not the least doubt then, and have none now.</p>

            . I am the wife of Mr. Peel. I saw the defendant at our house in March last, several times in in that month, and I had seen him about two years ago - he then left us the name of Smith; we then lived further up, in the same street - he came to have some printing done; I did not see him again till last March, and recognized him as the person I had seen - he came to know if my husband could engrave a plate for him, and brought a proof with him; Mr. Peel not being at home, he asked Barber if Mr. Peel could engrave a plate like that copy; he told him Yes - I saw the copy he produced; it was like this and printed on parchment - Mr. Peel met him as he was going out, in the passage; I afterwards saw him when he came to see a proof of the plate - I told him it was not ready then, and he was to come on Saturday; I know that he came on Saturday, and waited a quarter of an hour till Mr. Peel came in - I sent our lad for the proof; I took the proof from the lad who brought it, and Mr. Peel came in - I gave it to him, and he showed it to the defendant; I saw him when he came the same night and took them away - I put them up in the kitchen, and just as Mr. Peel came to the door the defendant came in and had them; my husband was taken to Union-hall on this charge, and detained six days - while he was detained I went out, by direction of the Magistrate, with Pople, the officer, to find the defendant; I went to the 'Change, and several places - I at last stationed myself on Londonbridge, and while there the defendant passed; I pointed him out to Pople, and said I was confident in my mind he was the man, but I would not swear to him till I saw him full in the face - I went up, and spoke to him; directly he saw me he put his handkerchief up to his face - I asked if his name was Thompson, or Thomas - I hardly know which, I was in such a state of agitation; it was the first name that came to my mind - he told me that was not his name; I said my name was Peel, and asked if he did not know me - he said No, he did not, he had no knowledge of me whatever; I said I was confident he did know me, for Mr. Peel had done some work for him - he said No, he did not know me, but when he first saw me he thought me very much like a servant that lived with him; I left him, and went to speak to Pople - I told him I had not had a sufficient view of his countenance, but we would watch him, see where he went to, and Mr. Peel should come and see him; we followed him up Gracechurch-street - he went up and down several courts, and when he got to the corner of Bishopsgate-street he looked round to see if I was following him; he had looked round several times before, and not wishing him to see me I went into a shop; when I came out both him and Pople were gone- I saw him before the Magistrate the same afternoon; I am confident he is the person, for I answered the door every time to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You answered the door the first time, and all? A. Yes - I think it was three times; it was not to me he spoke about the engraving - he asked me if Mr. Peel was at home; I asked him down to Barber - I cannot tell the date on which he first came; I rather think it was the beginning of March, and I think between three and four o'clock - we had dined; Barber dines with us - I think we had dined, but I do not recollect such a trifling circumstance; as near as I can recollect we had dined - I am confident he did not come so early as one o'clock; the apprentice was in the office, and so was I part of the time - I cannot say how long I staid; there was nobody else in the lower office -Barber was at work; I do not remember whether the presses were going - I paid no attention to the conversation between my husband and the defendant; I was in the office in which the presses were - my husband and Hayley were in a small place, a sort of counting-house; it is not a regular counting-house, but only some boards placed across - it is one room; I do not think any body else was at work in the office.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to call the defendant Thomas? A. I had asked the officer what I should do to see his face, but he kept his handkerchief up over his nose and mouth all the time - I do not think any body was at work at the presses when he was there, but I am in and out so many times I do not take notice; sometimes we are busy. and take extra men - my husband was once taken to Unionhall through a person informing against him; his apprentice's indentures were cancelled - I was never taken up; - yes, I was, at Union-hall.</p>
               <p>MR. BODKIN. Q. Do you mean that an officer took you into custody, or were you desired by any writing to go to Union-hall? A. I never was taken up by an officer<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300133"/>any where; a man had come into the house after this trouble of Mr. Peel's, and insulted me - he struck me, and I slapped his face, because he used improper language to me; that was the subject I went there about - I was never in custody; one of our presses makes a great noise when it is at work.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You speak of the office and counting-house - they are parted off by a board? A. Yes, as high as my shoulder - a piece is cut out, so that you can see who comes into the office; the defendant and Peel were in the counting-house, and I even with them, but not in the counting-house - it is too small to hold three; I cannot say whether Barber was in the counting-house any part of the time.</p>

            . I am an officer of Union-hall. In May last Peel was in my custody, with liberty to go out with me to look for a person supposed to have uttered a forged instrument - Mrs. Peel also accompanied me at times; Peel had described the person to me - I was on London-bridge with Mrs. Peel, when the defendant came in sight; Mrs. Peel was standing some distance from me; she ran to me, and said, "There, I think, is the man; there he goes;" I accompanied her, and followed him to about the centre of the bridge, about a hundred yards, and then she spoke to him - I did not hear what she said; he had a handkerchief holding up to his mouth, and when she spoke to him he kept it a little way off, but still kept it before his face; after she had done talking to him I followed him with her - she requested me not to lose sight of him; he went up Fish-street-hill, through White Hart-court, and several other little courts, in and out, till he came to the Cross Keys coach-yard, and into Gracechurch-street; I had him in sight the whole time - he did not call at any place, but kept looking back; he went quite out of the way - it was a bye way to get round; he looked back several times, and I suspected he saw Mrs. Peel - after he got across Cornhill into Bishopsgate-street he got a little way down, then crossed over the way - Mrs. Peel passed me, and got into a gateway; I saw the defendant go into a hosier's or draper's shop, and come out again at the same door in an instant - I saw no more of Mrs. Peel; I followed the prisoner into the Stock Exchange - the turnings he took were quite out of his way; having nobody to assist me, I went for Peel, brought him over with me, went into a court at the back of the Stock Exchange, and there Peel identified the defendant as the man - he was in the court among other persons, not alone; he said he was the man the moment that he saw him, without any doubt whatever- I took him into custody, and told him I wanted him for forgery - he said he did not understand or know any thing about it; I got into a coach with Peel, him, and two gentlemen.</p>

            . I am an agent, and deal occasionally in Mine shares; I have done a great deal in the Potosi shares. I know the defendant; he has dealt very extensively in such shares - I have got into my possession seventeen forged shares, which are here, and more than that; friends whom I have bought for have a great many more - I never saw Peel till he was in Pople's custody; I never ordered him to engrave a plate for me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You are the prosecutor of this indictment? A.Certainly; I have never been a member of the Stock Exchange, but have a clerkship in the house, and am privileged to be a member if I like; nothing has been produced from the mines - the money received by the directors has not been accounted for; I consider the shares worth something till that is done- I am not a proprietor; I am not connected with the Puno Mining Association.</p>
               <p>Q. Is not your name on this? (handing him a paper.) A. Yes, I can account for that; Puno is in South America- my name is put here by desire of the jobbers; the dealers wished me to sign them, that they might know a good from a bad one.</p>

            . I am a jobber, and dealer in foreign shares; I live in Bevis-marks. I have known the defendant two or three years - he sold me forty Potosi shares, shortly before the 7th of May; they were to be delivered to me on the 7th of May, and on the 7th of May he bought seventy of me; I have the memorandum, which I took out of the jobbing book; I had to deliver him thirty to balance - I did not deliver them, but told him to take twenty of Mr. Knight, and ten of Mr. Old; he paid Mr. Old for them, I believe; and I had to pay the difference, which was very considerable.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Has the prisoner always been a dealer in mining and speculating shares? A. Yes, very largely - I dare say he has dealt to the amount of thousands of pounds; I have dealt with him for some hundreds - mine was a time bargain; I did not deliver shares to him, but referred him to gentlemen in the market - I believe he had them; I paid him the difference in money - I do not consider it gambling.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this share? A.

            . I am a shopman to Mr. Reynold's, a pawnbroker, in High-street, Shadwell. The prisoner came to his shop on the 9th of June; she produced a duplicate of a bed, and said she wished to take it out - I got a man to take it home for her; Mrs. Rathbone, who had pawned it, came afterwards to stop it, and I produced the man who took it to the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>MRS. RATHBONE. These were all pawned in my name before I was married, and the marriage certificate has the same on it; I had only lived next door to her for three weeks - I suppose I dropped the bag in the street the night before these were taken out; here is only one duplicate of my ring, which is in my present name.</p>

On the 16th of May my copper was safe and fixed in my kitchen; I missed it about three o'clock in the afternoon - I went to Thomas Cunningham, who lives two doors off from me - he said he had seen two men with one; I went with him into a water-closet, and saw these two men beating out my copper; I know it was mine - I saw it fitted to the place again; I had seen it safe just before, and full of boiling water.</p>
               <p>Harnsworth. Q. Did you see two men beating it up? A.Burchett had it between his knees,; you struck at Cunningham, and made your escape.</p>
               <p>THOMAS CUNNINGHAM. I live two doors from the prosecutor's. I have seen Burchett about the neighbourhood frequently; I detected the prisoners in the watercloset of the Rose and Crown public-house, endeavouring to beat up the copper - Harnsworth struck at me, and escaped that time, but he was taken on the Tuesday week following; I am quite sure of his person - it is a most notorious house.</p>

               <p>JANE HELLINGS. I am the wife of John Hellings. On the 6th of June my goods were going to be seized - I went out, and had half a pint of beer; I was crying - the prisoner, who was a stranger, came and asked what was the matter; I told her - she said she would go home with me, and see me righted; I allowed her to stop all night we had some gin, and sat on the bed drinking; about ten o'clock at night, I felt my pockets going, and she walked away with them; this money was in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not give an alarm? A. I felt something snap, but was not certain it was my pocket - I did not undress all night; I saw her about two o'clock the next afternoon, and asked for my money - she said, "Come with me, I will make it all right;" I went to two houses with her - she could not raise it, and about seven I gave her in charge.</p>

On the 29th of June the prisoner came to my house with a gentleman, and had something to drink - when she was gone these articles were missed from the bar; I did not miss them till next morning - they had been two or three hours in the house, and some other persons were with them part of the time - they left about one o'clock.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300141"/>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q.What do you know the articles by? A. I have no mark, but they are like mine, and I believe them to be mine: the persons in the house seemed companions - I should think they staid two hours; they were not bad characters - there were two other females there; the prisoner and the gentleman came into the bar - the gentleman was intoxicated; I cannot say whether the prisoner was so- they had a good deal to drink, and there was a dispute about the reckoning.</p>
               <p>HENRY KEMPSTER. I am a Policeman. I found the prisoner in a lodging-house in West-street, Saffron-hill - there were two men and a female there; I said she was accused of robbing a man of 6l. - I found a sovereign in her hand; this decanter and cream-jug were found on her person - it was at four o'clock in the morning.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. We were drinking there from ten to two o'clock; the man who was with me gave me these things - we went to West-street, and there the gentleman said I had robbed him; I would have the Policeman called in.</p>

I heard of this transaction, and went to No. 12, Perkins'-rents, Westminster, on Saturday morning, the 25th, about half-past ten o'clock; the prisoners all occupy one room there, and live together - Mullins was at home; I searched a box there, and turned out a handkerchief - she said that was hers; I said, "Well, if it is, you shall have it;" I gave it her, and she put it in her bosom - I went on searching the place, and then took her to the watch-house; I found a cravat, a lace collar, and a shirt in the room, and a pair of stockings and a pocket in a box; I fetched Howells, who claimed<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300142"/>the handkerchief, which I afterwards took from her bosom; I found Wilson in St. Giles', brought him to the watch-house, and one cravat was round his neck.</p>

               <p>Wilson's Defence. On the 25th of June I left my father's house - I called on a young man to go to bathe; I saw the handkerchief laying on his chair - I asked him to lend me something to wipe myself with, and when I came out of the water he lent me this handkerchief; I was going to return it when the Policeman took me - as soon as the young man heard I was in custody he absconded, and the woman who lived with him.</p>
               <p>Mullins' Defence. The room did not belong to me; I went up when the Policeman was there, and seeing him taking the young man's things, I said, "Don't take my property away;" I did not know but it was the young man's till I got to the watch-house - I do not live with him.</p>
               <p>Richards' Defence. I was in Tothill-fields, and met a man, who asked me to lend him 2d. - I pulled out a sixpence to get change; he said he would sell me the cravat for 6d., as he wanted 6d. to get his breakfast.</p>

On the 26th of May, having dined with a friend, I was on my road home - about one o'clock in the morning, as I proceeded up Rathbone-place, I saw the prisoner before me and a man walking along with her; I overtook and passed them - they stopped at the corner of Rathboneplace, by the Percy hotel; as I passed the prisoner she looked very hard at me - I crossed the road, and she followed me; I requested her not to go with me, for she could get no advantage at all by my company, and requested her to return to her friend - she said he was no friend of hers, that she had never seen him before, and did not like him for he was putting a great many curious questions to her, and she did not wish to have any thing to say to him - she continued this sort of conversation till I got to the other side of the street; that was in crossing Charlotte-street - she wished me to go to a house with her, which I declined; she then asked me for money to carry her home in a coach - I asked where she lived; she said in Burton-crescent - I said the distance was very short, it was a fine clear night, and she had no occasion for a coach - she then became rather abusive in her language, and said I had deprived her of a friend; I reminded her that I had wished her to keep by that friend - I could not get rid of her; I cannot repeat all the conversation - she was very importunate, and to get rid of her I turned away from her, and at the moment of turning away, another female, who is here, happened to be passing; I joined her on purpose to ged rid of the prisoner, and walked a few paces with her - when the prisoner saw me join that female she ran after me, laid hold of the skirts of my coat, apparently to stop me; I put my hand round to take care of my pockets or my coat, and at that moment (I was walking alongside the other female) the prisoner put her hand over my shoulder, towards my breast - I moved my right hand to keep her away, but she repeated these efforts so frequently that I did all I could to push her away from me - I had not used sufficient force to keep her away, and therefore I laid hold of both her hands, folded them on her bosom, and gently pushed her into the street; I did it so gently as I could; I left her standing in the street, and came back to the pavement on the left side, upon which she instantly rushed towards me, and made a grasp at my breast - I had a diamond pin in my shirt, which was conspicuous; the moment she made the grasp, she withdrew a step or two -I put my hand to my breast, and found the pin was gone; I immediately charged her with robbery, and called Police! Police! a Policeman came up; I laid hold of her left hand myself immediately, and told him to lay hold of the right, which he did, and she was taken to the station-house - I did not feel satisfied with the Policeman's conduct; at the station I made a general complaint that I was robbed; Pattisson went out; the prisoner was on the point of being searched when Pattisson came in with the pin - my shirt was torn with her taking it - I had taken no description of liberty with her whatever.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You have stated very fairly that you took her by the wrist, I am sure you would not use unnecessary violence, but with as much force as you thought necessary, you removed her? A. Precisely so; she certainly appeared angry at my not acceding to her wishes - I was going home, and did not want to be troubled with any body; the last grasp she made was after I had pushed her away - I have never said I might be mistaken as to her intention; I said to Mr. Harmer that I did not wish to press hard upon her, for there was no anger in my feelings - she denied that she intended to steal the pin.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you use more violence than to keep her from your person? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q.What did you say to the other girl? A. I believe I asked where she lived, and where she was going; that was not in the prisoner's hearing - she was ten or twelve paces off: it was a still night - my object was only to get rid of the prisoner.</p>

            . I am unfortunate, but do not get my living by walking the streets. I was returning home, and heard the prosecutor and prisoner talking rather loud; I heard something about a coach, but cannot exactly recollect what - I saw the prisoner snatch at Mr. Maccallum's cravat; he pushed her away - she made a second snatch, and then he called the Policeman, who came up and took her; the Policeman told me I must go too - I heard something drop, but did not think any thing about the pin, and never saw it - they took me to the station; Pattisson afterwards called me out - I described the spot to him; he went away, and returned in about ten minutes with the pin.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before the prisoner was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300143"/>pushed away by Mr. Maccallum did you come up? A. I was passing; Mr. Maccallum said, "Are you going home?" I had not time to answer before the prisoner ran up to him- she had passed me with the prosecutor; I cannot say whether she could hear what he said to me, as she was behind me - he had left her and come up to me; she came up and gave the snatch - he took her by the hand and pushed her off the pavement; then she came and made a snatch at his cravat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not appear irritated and angry at the push off the pavement? A. She appeared angry, and was making use of very angry words.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not, in strong terms, deny indignantly that she had any intention of robbing him? A. She certainly said she was no thief - she appeared angry; a piece of his shirt was torn off.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the Policeman the prosecutor was dissatisfied with? A. I am - I do not know that I gave him any reason to be dissatisfied; I think he acted with rather unnecessary violence - as I was going up Rathbone-place I saw the prosecutor and prisoner, and hearing an altercation between them, I stopped, and saw the prosecutor push her into the road - he directly came on the pavement; I passed them, and he gave her into my custody - it was a clear still morning; I came up directly after the push, and he exclaimed, "She has stolen a diamond pin;" and gave her in charge - I saw him push her, and was near enough for her to see me, if she had looked; I was in my dress, and on duty.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mr. Maccallum followed me some distance, and asked my address, which I refused; he repeated the question - I asked why he put the question to me; he said he was very anxious to know, that he might call next day - I told him I was so situated I could not tell him; he then behaved very ill to me, indeed, turned away to another woman, and spoke to her - I turned round, took him by the coat or sleeve, and said, "You behave very unlike a gentleman," and believe I said, "You are a blackguard;" he then pushed me to the other side of the road - I thought he would have killed me, he threw me with such force into the road, and at the impulse of the moment I attempted to slap his face, or scratch it - if I could have got at it I would have done it; I declare I never saw his pin till I saw it at the station-house - he took hold of me, pulled me to the station-house, I did not know what for, but thought it was for the assault; when I got there I wept bitterly; he said, "I charge this woman with stealing a pin;" I was astonished - I was not at all anxious for his property, or any body else's; I want nothing but what is right.</p>

               <p>Robinson. Q. Did you not see me sitting in the same box as your friend? A. No: when Robinson was taken I went home - Corbyn was taken in about a quarter of an hour; I am a char-woman.</p>

On the 9th of April the prisoner came into the shop, and bought a body coat and pair of trousers, which came to 25s. - he gave me two sovereigns; my own coat was on the counter, with a pocket-book in the pocket - I went down into the kitchen to get change, which I came up and gave him; he then walked out with what he had bought under his arm, and my coat, with the pocket-book in it, on his back, leaving his old coat behind, which he had on when he came in; he had put mine on instead of his own while I was down stairs; I met him three weeks after, in the street, with my coat on - I turned round, and collared him; he said, "Oh, how do you do? I was going to bring your coat back;" I took charge of him - he had been frequently to my shop, offering half a crown for an old hat.</p>
               <p>THOMAS TILLMAN. I am the prosecutor's brother. I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner put the coat on, and put his own down, but did not know at the moment which coat he had on - the one he left behind was worth nothing; he went away with a blue coat on - my brother went to put his coat on, and could not find it.</p>

On the morning of the 17th of June I fell in with the two prisoners in Drury-lane, near Long-acre, a little before four o'clock - we went into a house in Drury-lane, and had something to drink; I had 15l. in 5l. notes, thirteen sovereigns, and two half-sovereigns - I am confident I had all this money when I met them; I at length went with them to <placeName id="t18310630-339-crimeloc1785">No. 4, Phoenix-alley Hart-street</placeName>

On the morning of the 17th of June, this day three weeks, I was out cleaning my lamps - I saw the two prisoners and another shorter person coming from Duke-street, Lincoln's-inn-fields, towards Gate-street, at a quarter-past five o'clock; I saw Booth take something, put it in her left hand, and with her right hand she threw it over the wall of a garden - I had seen the prisoners before; I told the Policeman, and by his permission I went over the wall, and found this green purse, which I have had ever since - the prosecutor claimed it.</p>

            . I am a watchman at the east-cellar of the London-docks. On the afternoon of the 25th of June I came out of the cellar, and saw the prisoners near a pipe of wine on the quay; the pipes had been set up to be repaired - Labay had a spile in his hand, ready to put into a hole which had been bored in the cask; Brenan was holding a bottle to catch the wine which was running out; when the bottle was full Lahay put the spile in - Brenan passed between me and Lahay, and put the bottle down between two casks; it contains about three quarters of a pint of port wine - I went to the gate, and reported them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q.How long have you been a watchman there? A.Seven years - the prisoners had no business to taste wine.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On the morning of the 21st of June, a little after one o'clock, I saw Holloway, (who has been tried,) in Phillips'-buildings, and watched him; he watched another constable who was on his beat in Isaac's-place, into the New-road - he stopped at the corner of Isaac's-place, and the prisoner came up and spoke to him; I followed him down Isaac's-place, and met Holloway with a sack, containing this harness - I collared him, and asked what he had; the prisoner then came up, and knocked me down; I was left insensible, and they both got away - when I came to myself I found the sack and harness by my side; I had known the prisoner for three months, and am positive he is the man - I apprehended him afterwards, and accused him of this; he said,"Stuff and nonsense, come and have a drop of gin, and let me go;" I knew him well - I have often been called into the Crown and Anchor to turn him out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. STURGEON. Q.Then you have had some scuffles with him? A. Yes: I never had a spite against him; I believe he and Holloway spoke to each other, but I was not near enough to hear - it was a nice star-light night, and there was a lamp just over; he resisted when I took him - I am quite positive of him.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How far is Salisbury-street from Chapel-street? A.Between one and two miles - my wife called at the public-house at half-past eight o'clock, and the prisoner carried my child home; I asked him and Lambert to go up and have some supper - we left the Goat about eleven; we made them a bed on the floor, and they were not out of my place till eleven o'clock next day - I have known the prisoner about twelve months - we had cold pickled pork for supper; we had had no fire for several hours; we had cold tea to drink, but no beer, for the houses were shut up - the prisoner and Lambert break fasted with us next morning; I lodge in the house; it was last Monday fortnight - I sat up till about three o'clock; I was never in custody, except for a noise in the street about four months ago - I was not detained.</p>

            . On the 20th of June I went to the Goat about six o'clock, and staid till about eleven; the prisoner and Cummings were there, and we went and helped Cummings and his wife home with their three children - he invited us to supper; we sat there till three o'clock in the morning, and had cold pork; we had beer to drink, and stopped all night - we had been at the public-house, but I had nothing but water at Cummings'; I do not know what the others had; they made up a bed in the front room, and Parkin and I slept there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q.Where do you live? A. In Milton-place. The prisoner is a carpenter.</p>
               <p>MRS. CUMMINGS. On Monday, the 20th of June, Parkin and Lambert supped at our house, and slept there; they remained there till eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time did you get home? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock; some beer was fetched from the public-house at the corner of the street for supper- I do not know who fetched it, as I was putting the children to bed in another room; I found it there when I came in, and drank some - we had no fire; I made tea about three o'clock, and lighted the fire then - there was some cold tea drank before that; they were smoking, and drinking beer.</p>

As I was coming to Bow-street, the next morning, I went by chance into the prisoner Smart's shop, in Princes-street - I showed him a pattern of some of the ornaments which I had lost, and asked if he had such goods, and if he had any lace according to the new regulation - he turned as if he was going to find the articles, then turned back, and said he had no such goods, for whatever he bought in that way he always melted it directly - he did not show me any thing then, and I went away; I went and saw McNiff, previous to the examination at Bow-street - I did not use any threat or make any promise to get him into conversation - I only said there was quite enough to convict him, as some kerseymere was found on him - in consequence of what he told me I went back to Mr. Smart's shop, with an officer, between ten and eleven o'clock the same morning - the officer went in first, and I waited about five minutes; I then went in, and Mr. Smart stated that what he had purchased he had melted down, and he gave us a bill of 1l. 17s. 6d., as a memorandum of what he had purchased that evening - he then produced this silver, which had been melted, and these other articles, which was what he stated he had purchased, and that he had not purchased any thing else that evening - this silver was then put into a bag, and taken to the office - he stated before the Magistrate that that was what he had purchased, and he had nothing else but what he had melted; the Magistrate immediately granted a search-warrant - I went with it with an officer; Mr. Smart remained at Bow-street - we then searched the premises, and in a back room behind the shop; we found a chest with a great quantity of silver in it - we pulled out a great deal of silver, and found the lace and these ornaments, which I had given to McNiff to work - I had marked them, and knew them again; McNiff had not exactly told me where these things were to be found, but he said it was in a shop near Wardour-street, going down towards the Hay-market; that answered the description of Mr. Smart's, and there I found these articles- when we found them, we produced them to Mr. Smart, and he acknowledged having purchased them of this man for 8s. - they cost me about 2s. 17s. 6d.; they were quite new- I am no judge of what would have been the worth of them to burn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Mr. Smart was not present at any conversation you had with the other prisoner? A. No; I had not been to Mr. Smart's before - he is a refiner; he says their business is to melt down silver lace - I showed him something like these ornaments, but I have not brought here what I showed to him; these which I found at his house correspond with what I showed him - these were sewn on a garment by mistake, but were never worn; they were taken off, and would be used again - I do not know what they would be worth to a refiner; I asked him whether he had any ornaments of this description, and like a star, which I made on a bit of paper- I asked if he had them to sell; I do not recollect a question being asked what they were wanted for - there was a person in the shop talking to him at the time; I do not know that these things are called lace in the trade - we call them ornaments; they are spangles, I believe - I do not know whether those he first produced are called ornaments; we do not use them - I think I went to the shop a second time about half an hour after the first - when we went back we still found him at home: the officer was in about five minutes before I went in - he was going to send his man with the things; the officer then said he would take them, and Mr. Smart said, "If you will take the things, I will come myself;" the officer said,"You must come yourself;" I think we were at Bow-street about a quarter of an hour before we went back a third time; we then left Mr. Smart at the office, but as we went back we met him in Covent-garden - I do not know whether he was on bail; I do not think he had an officer with him - I should imagine he was at large: he had an opportunity of going away - he said, when we were going back to his house, "You had better take my word, whatever was purchased was melted down:" he told us to desire his father to show us two tin boxes, and he showed us, very readily, over the place - I had not been to his house the day before; I went three times that morning - I think it might be an hour after my first calling that I went again, and he had that hour to have disposed of this property, but when the officer went it was there - I did not see his father there at first; his man was there, and he had an opportunity of telling him to get rid of the property; I have known the house for a long time - I know nothing of the parties; there had been an alteration in the military costume; we are acquainted with the costume, but I do not know that refiners know it - a man might not know whether what he bought was according to the present regulation or not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. The second time you went you brought away these two ornaments, through which stitches had been passed, but they had not been worn? A. Yes; I only asked him then if he had such things to sell - I said nothing to induce him to think I had any suspicion; the second time I went with an officer, and then he produced these silver articles, and went to Bow-street; he said these were what he had purchased the evening before, and he gave me this bill of the amount - he wanted to send his man with them; the officer said, "If you send your man I shall take them;" he said, "You shan't take them from my man, I will go and take them myself;" he did not say any thing about any chests - he said we might take his word there was nothing but what was melted; these things were found at the bottom of the chest, in the back room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You went three times to Mr. Smart's? A. Yes; and it was the first time I asked if he had any lace according to the new regulation.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. I went with Mr. Burgess to Mr. Smart's - I had not seen the other prisoner at that time; I went in before Mr. Burgess, and saw Mr. Smart there - I asked if he had bought any silver lace last night, and some ornaments belonging to a uniform coat; he called a man by the name of John, and asked him what sort of a man he bought the things of, and each of them described McNiff - I wished him to let the man come to Bow-street, to identify McNiff, and I said I wanted the property - he was weighing the ornaments, and Mr. Burgess came in; he did not state that these did not belong to him - Mr. Smart said these were the ornaments, and that the lace was melted down; he was going to give his man the ornaments, and as I wanted to take them he said he would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300149"/>go, and I said, "Very well;" - we went to Bow-street, and when we were going to execute the search-warrant, Mr. Smart wished to go, but I said he must stop - he said his father was old and nervous, and would be alarmed; I told him every thing should be done in a gentle way - he told me to tell his father there were two tin boxes he might show us, but he said it was no use to go to search, as they were burnt - I went down and saw this property taken out of a box, I think it was a tin box, but I was not near enough to see; in coming to Bow-street again, we met Mr. Smart in New-street - he turned and went to Bow-street, and was held to bail.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did the prosecutor go back to Bow-street with Mr. Smart? A. Yes - I do not know whether he was present when he was held to bail: I was in the shop, and the tin boxes were in the back room - there was nothing to hide them from my view; in my opinion they were taken from a tin box - there was a great deal of lace taken out: the question I put to Mr. Smart was, whether he had bought any lace the night before with military ornaments - he said he had, and he produced these things, I believe, or some similar - I believe he then asked the young man to come forward, and state whether lace had been bought with these ornaments, and I understood the lace was burnt, but whether it was the lace bought with these ornaments or not I do not know; he showed me something similar to this, which he called burnt - he was asked what he gave for it, and I thought it said on the bill, 1l. 17s. 6d.; if he trusted his property with me there would have been no necessity for his going to Bow-street - his father appeared a nervous old gentleman; we were afforded every facility in searching - there seemed no opposition to it; this property could have been melted down in five minutes - there was a fire and every thing backwards.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When Mr. Smart produced these articles, and showed the bill, did he tell you that he had bought other things? A. No, he did not - I understood the lace was destroyed; I did not go in to search the boxes - I did not see any deal box; there is a partition and a glass door between the shop and parlour - I had been in that room before the search, and saw the two tin boxes; I did not notice any deal box.</p>

            . I am a wool-stapler and merchant. I was at Mr. Smart's at the time of the search - I had been at Bow-street, and Mr. Burgess asked me to accompany him down - I saw this lace and property found in a box in the room adjoining the shop; I believe it was a deal box - there were some small tin boxes in the shop, but I did not notice any in the room; these articles were found in the bottom of the box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You will not swear whether there were any tin boxes in the room? A. No, I did not notice any; I will not swear whether they were found in a tin box or a wooden one - it was filled with lace; the constable, who is not here, was present -Mr. Burgess took out the things; I am not in business just at present - I am waiting the result of an appeal in the House of Lords, and some actions in the King's Bench - Mr. Smedly is my attorney.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know Mr. Smart before this? A. No, I did not; I had no quarrel with him, nor any interest to serve Mr. Burgess - I happened to hear Mr. Burgess was at Bow-street, and went in there; there were some tin boxes in the shop, which the officer took from a drawer - Mr. Smart's father was there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was the box from which these things were taken larger than the tin boxes? A.Much larger - I do not know that any one pointed out the tin boxes; I should think the box from which this property was taken was about a foot square - the tin boxes were about four or six inches.</p>
               <p>McNiff's Defence. I was very much inebriated, and in consequence of that I committed this act; Mr. Smart said, "Is this your property?" I said Yes; he said, "If it is not, I will not purchase it" - I still persisted it was, and he laid me down 8s.; he is as innocent of buying it, knowing it to be stolen, as I am guilty of the theft - I should not have done it had I not been drunk.</p>
               <p>Smart read the following Defence. I am utterly incapable of what is laid to my charge, and hosts of witnesses will tell you the same; the circumstances which have brought me into this, I would have detailed before the Magistrate, but was not allowed- we buy lace and ornaments to burn, that is, to get the silver they contain; we are not in the habit of selling them, and if any one asked if I had lace of any particular pattern, I should have answered No - on the day I bought these, several ornaments and pieces of lace had been offered, which had been refused, but about six o'clock I bought the silver ornaments of an officer's coat, and with them a piece of lace which I have since discovered had belonged to -; the late army regulations having dispensed with much of the lace formerly worn, it is very common for such articles to be offered for sale, though they had not been worn - when the prosecutor called at my house, what passed will be detailed to you; in about ten minutes after the Police-officer called, and asked if I had bought any military ornaments of a man, I showed him what I had bought at six o'clock, and gave him the weight, and the amount from the day-book - he asked me to take them to Bow-street, and I did; he asked if I should know the man - I said I did not, but he might ask my man; I went to Bow-street, and saw the man now beside me, but that was not the man I had bought these ornaments of - the lace brought with these ornaments had been burnt, as I stated; when the prosecutor and the officer asked where it was, I said burnt - you will at once perceive what lace I meant, but they who asked the question did not perceive my meaning; a search-warrant was then granted, and these things were found in an open tin box, with other pieces of lace which had been purchased, and which I had abundant time to have removed, had I been the person capable of the felony laid to my charge; all this I would have explained to Mr. Halls, but he would not allow me.</p>

            . I am foreman to Mr. Smart. I recollect these military ornaments and some silver lace being brought at the same time, by a person who is not here - I burnt it to ascertain the value and weight of it; this is the produce of it - I cannot exactly tell what it weights; my master gave 5s. 8d. an ounce for it - I do not remember how much was paid for it; I did not see McNiff come afterwards, but this lace was not brought by him - we buy to refine, not to sell in the same state we buy it; we melt it into bars.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You were present when these ornaments, and some lace which has been burnt, were brought to your shop? A. Yes; that was about five o'clock; I did not see these other things and this lace brought - we ask questions of persons who are strangers,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183106300150"/>of whom we have any suspicion; I do not know whether my master asks other persons - Mr. Smart keeps these things in a tin box in the shop till they are melted; we sometimes burn new lace and ornaments - the person we bought these ornaments and the lace which was burnt of, was a respectable tall man; I never saw him before nor since - he did not tell me where he came from; I was in the back shop - he brought an officer's belt, and I destroyed it myself.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you the only person employed at burning silver lace? A. Yes - there was a fire in the place when they came to Mr. Smart.</p>
               <p>Thirty-two witnesses gave Smart an undeniable character, several of whom being silver-refiners, valued the property at about 8s. to burn.</p>
