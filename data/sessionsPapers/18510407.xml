I sent him with an order, which I found at my. house, with orders to send a cart to Daniels and Payne's—the parties who left the letter said there would be a clerk meet the carman at the wharf, to tell him where to take it—I met Skeggs in Aldersgate-street, and pointed Brown out to him—he said he bad been to my house the night before, and wanted to know if it was come—I said, "Yes, and the man has been up here to know where he was to take it to"—he said it was to be taken to Bishopsgate-street.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at the Star Foundry, St. John-street; Hopping was in my employment, and left four or five days before the 27th Jan.—I believe this order to be his writing—I gave him no authority to write it—he had frequently written orders on my printed forms—I have missed blank printed forms from my order-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), there are two or three blank counterfoils here—this order does not fit either of those—this part is printed "Star Foundry, 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. St. John's-street, Smithfield. I will thank you to deliver to bearer as under for A. T. Batchelor"—this is the first book of the sort I have had—if an order had been sent with my authority there would be a counterfoil filled up.</p>

               <p>orders were written—I have given other orders besides those that are altered on the counterfoils—I may have given 100 orders during this year—every one that I have ordered has been executed—I had ordered ten or twelve tons of bar-iron from Messrs. Daniels and Payne previous to this—I have counterfoils of that in separate parts; it was sent for at I required it—I have written my orders on invoices since this book has been in the custody of the police—I do not remember an order for two tons of ingot copper from Mr. Bird—I think I do remember an order for a ton of spring-steel from Pace and Co., of Sheffield; it was a verbal order, which I give to the agent himself—I gave an order for a quantity of files to Henri. Fisher and Bramell, of Sheffield; that was written on a piece of note-paper, because the paper would not hold it—I gave no order to the Birmingham Cutnail Company for three tons of coals, nor for a quantity of files from Sheffield—Hopping had left my service five or six days before this order was written—he bad no settled wages; be was to be remone<lb/>rated for what he did—I did not require him wholly and solely; he was to make out a few bills, and do what was required, as my work was so dirty—be was six or seven weeks in my service, and may have received 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he may perhaps have signed twenty or thirty orders for me in his own name—he has never written his own name to orders when I have put mine—there has not been any joint order, to my memory; I will not swear either way—I do not think my name has been appended to any order with his—I was not in pecuniary difficulties while he was with me, nor am I now—I do not think he has pledged anything for me; I do not think he has pledged my watch for me; I do not know whether he has or sot—I never authorized him to do it—my watch has been out of my possession—I knew where it was—I do not recollect a wagon coming with tome spring-steel from Messrs. Daniels and Payne's, or any other place, when there was an amount of wharfage and cartage to pay upon them which I could not pay, nor did I give Hopping my watch to pledge for 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to pay the charges—I swear that—I never got him to sign a bill for me—I never asked him; I swear that—there have been no conversations between us about his signing bills for me—I did not ask him to accept a bill for me at three months for 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I know a person named M'Cabe—he vu never in the habit of getting bills discounted for me, or borrowing money for me; he frequently disposed of goods for me—I directed Hopping to draw a bill on Mr. Woodyer—I put my own name to it, I did not authorize him to do it—I endorsed it myself—I never gave Hopping authority to write to different houses, and use his own discretion in getting goods; that I swear—he has never given an order for goods without my sanction which I have afterwards received—I never told him if he could open an account for me I would pay him for it—I never sent orders to Messrs. Thompson and Foreman—I never sold iron or files, or any other property, at a considerably less price than I have paid for them. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  <hi rend="italic">had at one time held, that in a charge of this nature an assault was involved; that opinion had been overruled, but subsequently adopted. The question was, whither this was a case within the Statute. The Statute said, that where the offence charged involved an assault, then the prisoner might be found guilty. To inquire whether the offence charged, involved an assault, you must look to the language of the indictment, and to that alone; and whether this indictment did mention the word "assault," or not, did not signify, because it was clear that it need not be mentioned. The question came to this, whether in stating an the face of an indictment that a prisoner had carnal connection with a girl under ten years of age, you state that he committed an assault. Me was very much disposed to think that as connection could not take place without contact, that contact without consent amounted to an assault. A child under ten years of age was incapable of giving her consent; and if any consent were in term given, it would be wholly inoperative; he therefore thought it might be considered that an assault was involved, and that a person might be found guilty of an assault under this indictment.

                  </hi>, I am assistant to my father, a licensed victualler, of the Victory Tavern, Edmond-street, King's-cross. On 20th March about half-past ten o'clock at night, I was coming through Castle-street, the prisoner pounced upon me all of a moment, struck me with one fist under my chin, and with the other hand seized my watch and chain—I fell on the ground on my back from the blow—the watch was in my waistcoat pocket—he drew it out by the chain, which was passed through my buttonhole—I felt it drawn from me—my hat was knocked oft, and my stick knocked out of my band—I got up, left them behind me, and ran after the prisoner; I never lost sight of him—there was no one else in the street—I followed him closely—be turned a corner, but I was close to him—I pursued him to the corner of St. Martin's-lane—a young man there came up in front of him and collared him—he said, "For God's sake let me go—I gave him in custody to a policeman.</p>

On Thursday night, 20th March, a little after eleven o'clock, I was at the corner of St. Martin's-lane, with my wife and her sister—I heard a cry of "Stop thief!"—I saw the prisoner turn the corner, and the prosecutor behind him—I looked round, and saw him come across the road—I immediately darted out—he said, "For God's sake, don't stop me; let me go"—I caught hold of him, and in the struggle we both fell—I did not let him go—when he got up he said, "What business have you with me?"—I said "We will talk about that when the policeman comes up"—the prosecutor was behind me—I directly hallooed out, "Police!"—a policeman came up from the Seven Dials, and the prosecutor gave him in charge—the prosecutor's clothes were dirty all over the back when he came up.</p>

On Thursday night, 20th March, a little after eleven o'clock, I was in Seven Dials, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I went down to St. Martin's-lane—I saw a mob of persons, and the prosecutor gave the prisoner in charge, for robbing him of hit witch—the prisoner said that I ought to take him, meaning Barton, into custody, for he was as bad as him—I took him to the station—the prose<lb/>cutor's back was covered with mud, and he was without his hat—I believe he had been drinking, but he was quite aware of what he was doing, and capable of taking care of himself—people are generally confused after being knocked down—what I saw about him might arise from the blow, and not from drink.</p>

On 3rd Dec, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I left four toddy-ladles, two punch-ladles, a pepper-castor, some mustard-spoons, a cream-ewer, and a piece of silver, in the coffee-room; and some money in the bar—the kitchen window was shut, but not fastened—I missed the goods about eight o'clock next morning—the kitchen window was open—a person could get from the kitchen <hi rend="italic">to the</hi> coffee-room by a machine for taking dinners down to the coffee-room, but unless well acquainted with it he would stand a chance of striking himself—it moves by a pulley, which no one could use unless he was well acquainted with it—from the coffee-room you can get to the bar, by unlocking the door—it had been unlocked—the key was inside—nobody could open it unless he got into the coffee-room</p>

               <p>first—the keys of the drawers where the silver was kept were in a small glass in the coffee-room, on the shelf—I found the drawers open, and the keys in them, and missed the plate; also 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, which was left in the bar—I saw footmarks on the rails outside the kitchen window, and on the beds—the rails would have to be got over to get to the window—a person could get to the leads from 72, Berners-street.</p>

On the first Saturday in Dec. the prisoner came to my house, and asked if I had a room to let—I showed him the first-floor back-room, which opens on to the leads—Miss Minifie was not at home, rod the prisoner left, and came again at four o'clock, and saw her—she took him up-stairs—he did not sleep there that night—he came on the Monday evening—I went into the room on the Tuesday morning—the window-sill had then been wiped, but was still very dirty—I found a brown-paper parcel there—I opened it, it contained hay—the prisoner was gone between four and five in the morning—I did not see him again all be was at Guildhall—I saw him in a cell with four or five others, and recognized him directly.</p>

On 15th March, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoners standing together opposite Mr. Beach's shop in the Edge ware-road—I saw Thomas Smith lift this pair of overshoes off a hook in the lobby at the entrance to the shop—Hulbert was close to him, and the other two about a yard away—a female had gone into the shop just before, and not come out again—Thomas Smith gave the shoes to Hulbert, he put them under his jacket and walked away—I was in plain clothes—I ran across the road towards him, and he threw them down on the pavement—I took hold of him—he said a boy had given them to him—another constable came, and the other prisoners were apprehended.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been a greengrocer, of 71, St. George's-street. Between two and three o'clock in the night between 7th and 8th March, I was with a friend named Belsham, in Bishopsgate-street—we met two girls, who were strangers to us—we went into a public-house there, and treated them—we parted with them in Bishopsgate-street, between twelve and one; they had been in our company a quarter of an hour, at the most—we saw them again at Aldgate Church, and we went on to the Horse and Leaping-bar, Whitechapel, a night-house; my friend and the girls went in—I heard a disturbance, went in, and the girls asked me to pay for the gin—there were a number of people in the tap-room—I saw both the prisoners there—we remained there half an hour, and me,</p>

               <p>and my friend, and the two girls went into the parlour; Cannell was going in, and the landlord turned him back—I saw the other prisoner in the tap-room, but not at the time they were going into the parlour—the money with which I paid for the gin, I took out of my right-hand trowsers pocket—kept the money in a bag—there were sixty-eight or sixty-nine sovereigns in it—my other money was loose in my right-hand pocket, the bag was in my left—I had about six or seven shillings in my right-hand pocket—when we got into the parlour we sat down, and had a pot of porter, ant some meat and bread—I paid for it—I think we might have remained there about half an hour, or rather better—while we were there, I man in a light coat came in, and then the two prisoners, and another one—I did not produce any gold while I was in the parlour, nor at all while I was in company with the females, to my knowledge—it was about half-past two, as near as possible, when we left the Leaping-bar—my friend and the two girls went out first, and I followed them—I went through Spectacle-alley into Church-lane—Belsham and the two girls went on first, and I turned up John-street, which is in the same line—when I got there I stood for a time, and did not see any person; I turned round Back church-lane to a place called Williams'-rents, to make water—before I turned round, the two girls came up to me, and wanted to catch hold of my arms; I kept them off—they were waiting at the bottom of Williams'-rents, about three yards from me—I felt my pockets while I was there, and my bag was then quite safe—I was in the act of turning round when I saw the two prisoners about three yards from me—they made up to me—Cannell said, "What are you doing here? or "What are you about?—he then caught hold of me by my arms (be was at the back of me), and pressed them against my throat—then I recollect no more—when I came to my senses I found myself lying in the gutter—I have no recollection of being struck—I was bleeding from my note and forehead, under my eye, and at the back of the ear—Coglan was in front of roe, while Cannell was at the back—I did not perceive Coglan do anything more than he was in front of me, when Cannell seized bold of me—I examined my pockets immediately I got up, and both my trowsers pockets were turned inside out, and the money gone—I was confined to my bed till the following Monday, and then Kelly, the constable, came to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of Skinner's-buildings, Chelsea. On Sunday afternoon, 9th March, I was at the Castle, Broadway, Westminster, and saw the prisoners there—I drank out of a pot that was handed round, and remained there a quarter of an hour, till the house shut up for Church—the prisoners left with me—they said they knew where to take me if I would stand a pot of beer—I said I would do so—there were five of them—they took me under an archway in the next street, but could not get any—we went to a private house and got some there—we came out, and they asked me to stand some more; I would not—Leary put his hand across my breast, Glynn pulled my legs from under me and threw me down—one of them caught hold of my shoulder, and I struggled to get away—it was a drunken spree altogether, that was all I can make of it; if you think proper to forgive them I will.</p>

(these three lamps were then produced) "I cannot tell—I keep a book in which I enter the things I purchase, and there are lamps entered in that book—I cannot say if these are in the book—I purchase what comes to my hand—I did not pay him for them at all"—upon that, Mr. Alderman Humphery ordered him to be put in the dock, as a person to be charged.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable in the London Docks—the prisoner was a landing and shipping foreman there, at the West Quay. On 25th March, about twenty minutes past four o'clock, as he was passing out at the west gate, I stopped him, and said, "I want to speak to you, Barrell step this way"—I then said, "I have information you have something in your hat"—he said, "No, nonsense"—I said, "I must look," and he said, "Take it off"—I did so, and in it found 11<hi rend="italic">b.</hi> 4 ozs. of black tea (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked if he had any more—he then put his hand in hit right coat pocket and pulled out a little more—I put my hand in and pulled out 6 ozs. altogether (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I asked him to sit down, as he seemed overcome—I asked him where he got it from; he said he got it from the West Quay, under the shed—I said, "Did you get it out of a chest?—he said, "Out of a chest," and that it was sweepings—it was clean tea, free from dirt—the next morning, as soon as the Custom's locks were taken off the sheds, I went to the West Quay shed and found a chest of tea broken, and about the same quantity of tea gone from it as there it here—this is a sample from the chest (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—in my judgment they are both of the same sort.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, in the City, and live at 77, Westbourne-terrace, Hyde-park. I lived at the Albany before I was married, and the prisoner was my valet and confidential servant—he remained with me six months after I was married, and left on 20th Dec. last—on 28th Feb. I missed six old check-books and gave information to the police—I also missed two hair-brushes, three velvet caps, a pair of slippers, a pair of plated spurs, three pairs of new kid gloves, four shirt-studs, thirty-four keys, a seal, a gold puzzle, an unset diamond, a microscope and case, two pairs of breeches, a whip, four flannel shirts, and a plate with "Brettle" on it—I was with the officer who found the things in the prisoner's box, at his lodging—at the police-station, before I found them, he cried, begged for forgiveness, and said if I would not let him be locked up, he would return my check-book and all the property he had belonging to me—I have not given him any of these things—the microscope cost about forty guineas.</p>

               <p>I placed confidence in him—he lived with me about four years at the Albany—I had a very good character with him from Sir Charles Kent, who is now dead—he had to look after the plate and my clothes and to wait at table; those were his only duties—I may have sent him on confidential errands—I have often given him letters to give to ladies—I have not, to my memory, sent him to make appointments with ladies—I do not know a lady named Theobald; I did about seven years ago; she is dead; the prisoner was not with me then—as a servant, he has occasion<lb/>ally admitted women there—I never reposed any confidence in him with reference to those matters—I never requested him not to communicate facts which came to his knowledge—I was very often in the habit of having card parties, but not on Sunday evenings that I know of—I recollect a Mrs. Smith coming to my chambers while the prisoner was there; Mr. Smith came while she was there—Mrs. Smith was not put in a cup<lb/>board, she was put in an outer room—the prisoner did not have to get her away while Mr. Smith was there—this is a system of intimidation which has been pursued towards me, to keep me out of Court—I cannot put it upon any person; but the fact of Mrs. Smith being subpoenaed is sufficient to show it—they thought that now I am married I should be ashamed to face the questions of the prisoner's counsel—I know Mrs. Lock, she is my housekeeper—she is not here to intimidate me—I have not been intimidating her; I have said nothing to her—she told me the prisoner's solicitor had been trying to make her say something which was not true, which I communicated to my solicitor—I have trusted the prisoner with 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he always accounted accurately till this time—he never gave me notice to leave; I gave him notice—I have no recol<lb/>lection of his being desirous to leave me when at the Albany—I never offered him a new suit of clothes and six months' wages if he would leave roe—I turned him out of the house about 20th Dec. last, for gross imper<lb/>tinence to my wife—these are my private check-books, I do not Wish you to look inside—I drew checks whenever I had bills to pay—I cannot say whether I ever missed drawing a check for a week; without looking over them; here are three drawn in one day, two on another, one on another, and two days afterwards, another—seven of my check-books were found in the prisoner's box, the latest date in them is 25th Oct., 1850—I never gave him any check-books to destroy; I always keep them under lock and key—I never gave him anything but some old clothes and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note on the day I was married—I have not charged any other person with robbing me—I discharged my coachman because I had reason to believe he robbed me—I never said a Mr. Leek robbed me—the prisoner did not ask me to look over his things when he left; I did not say "They are all right, John"—the check-books are of great value to me as receipts.</p>

                  </hi>. I am chief clerk at an Insurance-office. I lived at the prisoner's house, 57, Beaumont-street, Marylebone, with my family, for three months—there was no male person that I was aware of in the house: but a relation of the prisoner's, a widow, did the down-stairs work—on 8th Feb. I got home to dinner about six o'clock—I remained there a very few minutes, as I bad to go out to our chambers—I returned in a quarter of an hour, and the prisoner asked me if I had seen any man going out—I said, no, I had seen no one near the house—she said as she was in the kitchen she thought she beard some one in the passage, and thought it very likely there had been a robbery committed—she said, "It is very pro<lb/>bable there is a man up-stairs now"—I desired some persons passing by to fetch the police—the prisoner said, "I will go for a policeman myself," and went outside for four or five minutes—I remained at the door the whole time, and no one passed me either way while she was gone—I saw the other woman coming down-stairs with a light in her band—she said she thought there was a man under the bed up-stairs—she seemed rather flurried; her hair was falling about—at that time the police had arrived—we immediately went up-stairs—the prisoner pointed to a cloak on the floor, and said, "There's your man"—the drawer of my daughter's dressing-case was under the cloak—the place was in disorder, and every<lb/>thing lying about—I missed articles of jewellery and wearing-apparel, and two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank-notes—my loss altogether was between 80<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 90<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at the least.</p>

M. Holmes—he did not put any name up—I did not enter into any agree<lb/>ment with him—he had a paper put up in my office, "All letters addressed to R. M. Holmes and Co., to be left with Mr. Edwards"—we had fre<lb/>quent conversation in the course of his coming to and fro, as regards busi<lb/>ness, and he said that he was about to open a sherry house; that he had a great deal of property coming to his wife, and that his uncle was con<lb/>nected with Spain, that he should only ship sherries, and he wished me to supply his customers with other articles—that was the agreement we were about to enter into, and he was to receive a commission upon them—on 22nd Feb. he said to me, "I was at Woolwich yesterday, calling on my different customers, and among others Mr. Richards, of the Castle Inn, Woolwich, do you know Mr. Richards?—I said, "Yes"—he said, Richards was a purchaser, and asked me to let him have samples to show to Mr. Richards—I let him have the samples—next day he said that he had sold Mr. Richards a pipe of the port, and a hogshead of the sherry, and wished me to take out the warrants—I did so; these are the warrants (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I endorsed them to Mr. Richards—I at the same time gave him this invoice—(<hi rend="italic">read—This was made out—Mr. W.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor in Clifford's-inn. In Oct., 1849 I had some communication with Mr. Henry Gobat, in consequence of which I ultimately saw the prisoner, and some communication took place between him, me, and Mr. Gobat—I advanced the prisoner 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and some title-deeds were deposited with me as security—a memorandum was given—there was a receipt on the back of the deeds for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a promissory-note was given for 140<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. with 5 per cent, interest, at three months—it came due in Jan. 1850—it was not paid; but I saw the prisoner and Mr. Gobat, his solicitor, in Jan., 1850; they applied for a further loan, and I said if they would give a mortgage, instead of a deposit of the deeds, I would see if I could advance them more money—I heard something respecting the prisoner, and declined to make the advance, and urged him to give the mortgage—the prisoner called on 23rd Jan., 1850, alone—he said, "I shall owe you something for the abstract I ordered you to send to Mr. Richardson's"—I said, "Yes, it was a very long abstract"—he said, "Let me know what the amount is"—I told him, and he said, "I will pay you the amount if you can give me the difference out of this little bill"—he produced this bill to me, for 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I said, "Who is this James Benjamin Parker? I do not know the acceptor"—he said, "He is a very respectable man, a corn-merchant, residing at Colchester, with whom I have had considerable dealings"—I said, "Very well, as that is the case, I will take the bill"—and I gave him a check for the difference, 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—when the bill became due in April, it was not paid; it was returned to my banker's, noted—I afterwards applied to Hankeys', where the bill was payable, and they stated they had no account—on the bill becoming due, I wrote to Colchester, to Newton, and to the acceptor, Parker; and I received my letter back from the post-office—it is directed to "J. B. Parker, corn<lb/>merchant"—I went to Colchester; I had friends there, of whom I could inquire—I went to the banker's: to the Corn Exchange: to the editor of the newspaper, and the solicitor, who all said, there was no such person there I inquired at every probable place—Newton had left—I tried to find him, and could not—when I came back to town, I continued to make exertions to find him—I did not hear of him till he was in custody, in Feb., 1851.</p>

B. Parker, corn-merchant, Col<lb/>chester, were written by Parker—I do not know his writing—I did not see Parker three different times on the day the prisoner was taken—on the face of the deeds there was a receipt for 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but Mr. Barnes, of Colchester, said they were not worth a shilling—I have not issued two writs on this bill; I have no writs on it—I know nothing of the Fingering Hoe Mills—I know the Military Mills—I do not know a person named</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Blenheim, Bond-street, Chelsea. On 19th Feb. all the prisoners were at my house—M'Nally, Dogherty, and Wooderson from about three o'clock, in and out, except Wooderson, who did not go out till six or seven o'clock—they had two or three pints of a porter—Cogan came about seven, and I do not think I saw him after half-past—I do not think I saw Wooderson there after six, but M'Nally and Dogherty remained till near half-past eleven—about seven or eight M'Nally and Dogherty, who had been out, brought in the girl White—they all came in sober, and had not been there long before they appeared to get tipsy, M'Nally, Dogherty, and Wooderson were continually sick and unwell about the room between four and six—they actually vomitted—they could not have got drunk on what they had had from me—when White was brought in she came to the bar, called for a pot of porter, and took it into the tap-room, and then began singing loudly—I told my man, she must go—she went away, and I did not see her again—she was not there above a quarter of an hour—I do not allow females in the tap-room—the cellar where I keep my best sherry is immediately under the tap-room—my attention was called to the floor next morning by the potman, and I found a hole, which had been evidently made by this poker (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was of the same size, and had been burnt through, and the board came up easily—there was no nail in it—when that was raised the wine was in view, and a man could get at it by putting his arm down about a foot or eighteen inches—I found my stock of wine in a very disturbed state, and missed about two dozen bottles, at 48<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman to Mr. Palmer. I recollect the prisoners being at my master's on 19th Feb—I took them in some beer—it did not exceed three pints—Wooderson bad been drinking when he came in, but M'Nally and Dogherty were sober—White came in the evening; she was merry, but I do not think she was drank—M'Nally and Dogherty got tipsy, and Wooderson more so—M'Nally and Dogherty were sick—about eleven I put out the lights, except ohe small one, and laid down to take a nap—M'Nally and Dogherty were then in the room, and a stranger—in about ten minutes I was disturbed by a strange noise under the seat I was lying on—I looked round and said, "What are you <hi rend="italic">chaps</hi> up to? I know there is something more than usual <hi rend="italic">up,</hi>" and I saw two wine-bottles standing on the floor, and M'Nally and Dogherty in the same box, about a yard from them—I laid down again and went to sleep, and did not wake again till twelve, when they were gone, and the bottles also—White came in the course of the evening, and commenced singing—I received directions from my master to forbid her singing, and tell her to go, as no females are allowed in the room—next morning, about ten o'clock, I found a board had been raised up, and showed it to my master—On 20th Feb. I heard Wooderson say, in the pretence of Dogherty and M'Nally, to a person not in custody, "Well, what if I did have a few bottles? I wish there was another concern to come <hi rend="italic">off</hi> to-night; who was the worse for it?</p>

I am master of Dunning's Alley Work-house, which belongs to the East London Union, and is appropriated for the reception of female paupers in that Union—the paupers dine together in the hall, at twelve o'clock—the prisoners were inmates—on 1st April Collins, Fuller, Donovan, and Dunlevy were sitting at one table, and Burchell was employed in handing the others the meat after it had been weighed—in the course of the dinner, Fuller said she would be master of the house—I do not recollect now what the others said—Burchell took a potato off the plate of a girl named Sparkes, and I think she touched her nose in so doing—I requested her to sit down, and as she was proceeding to the end of the hall, she turned, and I saw her throw the potato—it passed near my head—I suppose it was thrown at me—I called on the porter, who was present, to do his duty—a girl named Margaret Conner attempted to put Burchell out of the hall—she resisted, and the porter put her out—as soon as the door was shut, Fuller threw the contents of a pannakin of beer in my face, and Collins the contents of the salt-box—Donovan and Dunlevy each threw a plate, one of which hit me in the face, and the other one my head, of which I have the mark now—after that plates came rapidly, and pannakins from the prisoners, and I saw knives and forks falling about me—there was a great disturbance, tumult, and riot—I tried to clear the room, and several kicked me behind, but I can<lb/>not say who it was—my face was streaming with blood at the time—I got into the yard—Fuller, Donovan, Dunlevy, and I believe Collins, followed me—Fuller got hold of me by the neck-handkerchief, and tried to strangle me—the others also had hold of me—I was afterwards rescued by some of the other inmates—blood was then running off my nose and chin—I am suffering from the blows now; these plaisters are from the effects of them—I am still under medical treatment—after I was rescued, they rushed up-stairs, and destroyed 250 panes of glass—there were also five door-plates broken, and the sashes of the kitchen-window were broken by Donovan.</p>

On Sunday evening, 30th March, about seven o'clock, I saw the prisoner coming from the yard, and go out at the front-door—there is a door in the yard which leads from one yard to ano<lb/>ther, and I saw that open—I immediately ran out, and saw a horse-trough moved from its place, and placed against the wall, so that any one could get on the tiles, and my bed-room window was open—I went up to my room, and missed my watch from off the drawers, which I had seen safe there at four—I went out, found the prisoner in a turning close by, brought him back to the front of the bar, and asked what he had got in his pockets; he turned out several things, but nothing of mine—I then went in search of a person who was with him at our house—I was gone about two minutes, and brought him back (he was discharged by the Magistrate)—I kept them there while my father went for a policeman, and during that time they pulled our gas-burner down, and struck me several times; and during the striking I picked up this handkerchief, (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which is mine—a constable came and took them into custody; and while I was gone to the station, the watch was found in our passage—I bad passed through there when I went after the second man, and am quite sure it was not there then—next morning I missed a pair of boots which I had left in my room on the Sunday-morning, and found an old pair under my bed, which did not belong to me—I was going to the station, and met the constable half-way, bringing my boots; these are them <hi rend="italic">produced</hi>—a person by walking on the horse-trough, as it was placed, could get on the kitchen, and could then get in at my window—the value of the things I lost is 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Windsor-terrace, City-road. On 24th March, I was in Chiswell-street, about half-past four o'clock in the after<lb/>noon—I was looking at a placard, and felt my dress twitch—I put my hand down, and felt the little boy (Deane's) hand coming out of my pocket—I caught him by the arm, and I saw the hand of the arm that I had hold of, go into his own pocket—he struggled to get away—I then held him by the collar of his coat—Jones came and took him by one arm, and another boy took him by the other arm, and took him forcibly away from me—they got away, and ran down Whitecross-street—I ran down after them till they came to some courts and lanes, and there they dis<lb/>appeared—I had had three half-crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence in my pocket—I felt my pocket the instant the hand was withdrawn, and the money was pone—I went to the station-house, and gave information as soon as I could, and I saw Jones in custody of an officer in about a quarter of an hour afterwards; and while I was in the police-office I looked out and saw Deane opposite.</p>

I was on duty in Waterloo-place, and followed the prisoner and another person to Mr. Greenhill's, wax<lb/>chandlers, in Bury-street—I waited a minute, then went into the shop, and saw a bundle on the counter and another blue one in the scales, I asked the prisoner to let me see what the bundles contained; he said they were his perquisites—I requested to see them, and he said, "It is no matter they are my perquisites"—I told him I must see them, and took the bundle out of the scales, opened it and found it contained a quantity of scrapings, some long pieces, and several whole candles (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found in the other bundle several whole candles—Mr. Greenhill was called to the shop, and I told the prisoner he must tie them up and come with me to his master's, he did so and we went—when we got to Mr. Hoare's, the prisoner went up-stairs, and I waited in the servants' hall with the candles—in three or four minutes I was called up; Mr. Longworthy ex<lb/>amined the bundle with the long pieces, and said to the prisoner, "Oh, Thomas, these are not your property, they belong to Mr. Hoare—I have had my suspicion a long time"—the prisoner said, "I am sorry for it"—the butler gave him into my custody—I weighed the bundles at the station, and found them to be 131bs.</p>

I am butler to Mr. Hoare, of Spring-gardens, and have been in the service of the family forty years—the prisoner was under-butler thirteen months—on 8th April, about half-past ten, he asked me to allow him to go out; I told him it was very inconvenient as the family were just leaving town, and he was to be back in ten minutes—he went out, returned shortly afterwards and said to me, "I have been out for the purpose of selling my wax pieces and ends, and a policeman has stopped me, if you will say they are my perquisites the policeman will let me go"—I said I should do no such thing; "If you have taken anything improper you must stand the consequences"—I called up the policeman, he brought the things, and I took up a large piece (I think this is it), and said, "Thomas this can't be right;" and he said, "I took that out of the dining-room"—all pieces above an inch long I should consider to be Mr. Hoare's property, and I never sanctioned the prisoner taking any away above that—I picked out what I considered to be Mr. Hoare's, and there were about 13lbs. there were 31bs. of whole candles worth 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I gave the candles out to the prisoner; and I have asked him if the candles were burnt, and he has told me they were; I suspected they were not and told him to be careful, and that they were to be burned within an inch, as my bill for wax was greater than it had been for years—I keep the candles in the wine-cellar; on 24th March, I left the cellar door open; when I returned I found my drawer open and missed some candles.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an accountant, of 3, Dunster-court, I have the care of two houses. On 1st April, in the evening, I heard a noise in the first floor of No. 3, where I live—I tried the counting-house door, and found it locked—I went out, and saw the prisoner at the first-floor window attempting to escape—I said if be did, I would shoot him—he went back, and I sent for the police—he came to the window again, and jumped out into the court with a piece of iron in his hand—I tried to secure him, but he beat at my head with the iron with great violence, and ran down the court—I pursued and threw a glass bottle at him, which struck him in the back—I pursued him into Mincing-lane, and with the assistance of the police secured him without losing sight of him—he threw down a bunch of picklock keys which the policeman took, and this piece of iron, which I picked up—this key unlocks the door, we found marks of the inner door being tried to be forced—the drawers and cupboards were in a state of confusion, but nothing had been taken.</p>

Mr. Hamilton, I presume?"—I said, unfortunately for him, I was not, but was a police-sergeant—he said, "Oh, my God, I am betrayed! who has betrayed me?"—that was not said in the same tone of voice—he appeared to get better—I found this diary on the table—I told him I should take possession of it—he said, "Oh, no, don't take that," and took it up and clasped it to his bosom, saying, "Don't take that on any account; let me have it."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a bootmaker, of King-street, St. James's-square. On 21st Jan., near dusk, the prisoner Charles came and asked permission to leave an umbrella, which he did—in the course of an hour the two prisoners came, with another person, who I cannot swear to—it was not the father—Arthur said he wanted a pair of dress boots, to go to a ball in Kent—I showed him a pair—he tried them on, and asked the price—I told him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he ordered them to be packed up—I packed them up, and laid them on the cutting-board—they all three left—the prisoners came back—Charles asked me if there was anybody to mind the horse—my son went out to do so, and then Arthur came in and asked if I had another pair of boots to fit him—he tried on another pair—they did not fit him, but he said he would have them, which made me suspicious—then I measured him for another pair—Charles then took his boots off, and asked me to measure him; to do which I had to turn my back upon Arthur, and when I turned round again I missed him and the pair of boots—Charles said nothing, but we both went to the door, and Arthur and the dog-cart were both gone—Charles said, "Why, he is gone"—I said, "Yes"—I asked him the name of the young man who had gone—he said, "Lionel Douglas"—he called himself Arthur, and said they were brothers—he said he would have a bottle of polish and a brush—I said, "Being brothers, you must give me the address"—he gave it, "No. 6, Belgrave-place"—I took the boots, but could only find a Douglas at Belgrave-terrace—I did not leave the boots—I have never seen the other boots since—they have not been paid for.</p>

I recollect the prisoners coming to my father's shop the second time—Charles asked me to pack up the boots—I did so, and placed them on the cutting-board—they came a third time, and asked if there was any one to hold the horse—I said I would—when I had held it three or four minutes, Arthur came out, and brought a paper parcel, threw it under the seat, and drove away.</p>

On Sunday night, 2nd March, I was going to the warehouse about five minutes past ten o'clock—at the end of the court I saw Green's little brother; he called out—the prisoner could hear him—he said, "Halloo, <hi rend="italic">Fred!</hi>" and then whistled—when I got up the court I saw Sharp getting out of the ware-house window; Green was helping him out—Sharp jumped over the wall leading to the next court—Green went behind a door—I took hold of him, he said, "Don't, <hi rend="italic">Torn,</hi> it is not me"—his father came out, took him from me, and said, "It was not him; it was another boy, who has just run away"—the policeman came up, and he looked all over Green's father's house, but could not find anything—we then went into the warehouse, and found the iron bar had been moved, which was against the window—I had seen it safe on Saturday night—no one could have got in while the bar was there without forcing it—it was necessary to open the window to move the bar—no one goes there on Sunday—some merinos, some Orleans cloth, a pair of boots, and a piece of cotton, of my master's, had been removed—they were found in a water-butt in the court—they were safe in the warehouse on Saturday night—these are them—some images on a shelf just before the window had been turned on one side, and knocked down.</p>

On 27th March, about half-past five o'clock, I came into my shop from the back-parlour, heard a conversation, and saw the two prisoners standing by my private door, close to the side of the shop—I heard Andrews say to Watts, "You could have done it before if you liked"—they could not see me; but I was very close to them—Andrews said, "Now is your time"—I stepped back behind a loo-table, and Watts put his hand round and seized a chair—they were walking off together—I rushed out and caught Watts—there was a cry of "Stop thief!"—some gentleman caught Andrews and brought him back—there is a fore-court in front of my shop; and the private door is a considerable distance from the street.</p>

I am fourteen years old—before this rob<lb/>bery I lived with my parents in Golden-lane—I became acquainted with the prisoner about a week before I was apprehended, at Earley's public-house, in Thrall-street—on this Wednesday morning I went with him to Romford—on the same night, about nine o'clock, I was going down White-chapel with him, and we saw the woman—the prisoner said, "There is a woman, go on to her, she has got it"—<hi rend="italic">Tim</hi> Cathedy went to her, picked her pocket of the money, and ran down a lane, where the prisoner snatched the purse out of his hand, and told us to go on to his house and wait there, and when he came he told us to go home and then to the coffee-shop, and then he took us to the public-house and made us spend 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a piece—he had given us 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—he stood behind the ladies while they were buying the teapot—there was no other man with him—I know Joseph Williams, who lives down Keate-street.</p>

On 19th March, in conse<lb/>quence of something I heard, I went to the station—I found a truss of hay there, which I could swear was mine—I then examined my premises, and traced some hay from the stable in my yard, down Great Ilford-lane, I should think it might be a hundred rods, till I came to Mr. Hunsden's gate, where it had been dropped; there was a good deal of hay—Dennis has been in my service from a child almost—I cannot say whether he left me any time; he has been with me almost all his life—neither he nor Page had any business to take my hay—the place where it appeared to have come from was not locked.</p>

On 2nd April, I marked some sixpences, shillings, and seven fourpenny pieces, and gave them to Hardy, who is a customer of mine, to go to my shop—Frederick Berry was afterwards brought to me at the parlour of the Blue Boar by police<lb/>men Benton and Harvey, and I asked him if his brother had given him anything—he said he had given him nothing—he afterwards said he had given him a fourpenny-piece, which was produced, and was one of those I had marked.</p>

On Friday evening, 28th Feb., I was at the White Swan, at Deptford—the prisoner was there—we drank together—I left about nine o'clock, and walked towards home—the prisoner followed me, and all of a sudden he ran his hand into my right-hand trowsers-pocket, and then struck me a very heavy blow on the side of the head, which knocked me down on the footpath—I had sixpence in silver, and three halfpence in copper, in my pocket—I know it was safe when I was in the public-house—I had taken it out in the prisoner's presence, to pay for the beer—I was perfectly sober, and remember everything that happened—I am sure it was the prisoner who knocked me down—I got up as soon as I could, and said, "You vagabond, you have robbed me;" he said, as he ran through the railway-arch, "I have only got three halfpence"—I went to the station, and gave information.</p>

It was my duty to receive goods from Scarborough, and to check them with the way-bill—I have not the original way-bill here—I have made search for it, but have not been able to find it—I checked the parcels brought by Scarborough with a pencil—I have seen a copy of the way-bill; the bill I took in and gave to Mr. Hemmington—it would be checked by me, copied, and put on the file—it was copied in the invoice, and the invoice sent down with the goods; that is the practice—if Scarborough brought any goods on 19th Dec, 1849, I checked them.</p>

               <p>pieces of linen rough-washed, and other things—I told her it was all stolen—she said, "If it is, I don't know anything about it"—I found nine pieces of muslin—I told her they were all stolen property—she said, if they were, she knew nothing about it; Mrs. Barrett brought them to her to take care of, so that they might not be found in their house if it were searched—I came down-stairs with her again, and she said she was very sorry for what she had done, and she had not told me the truth when I first came to her—I asked her where her husband was—she said he was gone to London—she made communication to Mr. Hacton, and they went into the back-garden, and I saw Mr. Hacton come in with two soldiers' coats on his arms—I said, "These are the very things that we have been looking for"—Mrs. Evans said Mrs. Barrett had thrown them over the fence to her, and when she came and asked her for the duplicates she asked her to throw them away—I found two pairs of tan-leather gloves in the pocket of a coat that Enoch Barrett had on in his bedroom—I told him they were part of another truss that had been stolen the same night—he said he had had them of his brother—I found another pair of similar gloves in a box in his bedroom—the two pairs that were in the pocket appeared to have been worn—he said he did not know where his brother got them, but he did not believe they had been stolen; that his brother had been in the habit of coming there, and he never took notice of what he brought in; he brought them in a bag, and left them there, and he did not interfere with his brother's business; that his brother was in the habit of coming there and putting his goods down in a bag in the corner—I then returned to Mrs. Barrett and her husband—I produced these two coats to him—I said, "These are the coats I was speaking about just now, when I found this cuff in the corner"—he said, "These coats have been on my brother's bed for a long time"—they were not on the bed when I searched the house on Friday, or I should have seen them—he said, "They were there when you searched the house before"—I said, "If they had been there I should have seen them, because they are the particular things that I have been looking for"—Mrs. Barrett said she had thrown them over the garden, thinking that if they were found in their house they might get them into trouble—I found these four whistles in Enoch Barrett's pocket—they are all of different notes—I found this cord in a cupboard in the back kitchen—it has been cut at one end—this is the cord used on the sheets of the trucks—it is cut at one end and it is tarred—their sheets and ropes are all tarred—all the others are just the same as this, and bound round as this is—they fix on one end of the sheet and tie down to the truck—I asked Enoch Barrett how it came there—he said he did not know—on Saturday 15th Feb. I went with Mr. Owen to New-port Pagnell—I searched George Pearson Barrett's general-shop there, and found a great many things—this bundle of shawls and three red worsted cravats hanging up in the shop—they were new, and exactly correspond with the one I have produced—I found three dozen and one pairs of braces and seven pairs of Berlin gloves, which correspond with those I found in Albert-street—I found a packet of buttons of a similar kind to those I found at Evans's, these are marked 400, some printed cotton, with 43 1/2 stamped on them, two red worsted cravats that had been worn of the same kind, four pairs of tan-leather gloves, corresponding with what I found in Albert-street, five pairs of leather gloves in the bedroom, and</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Samuel Griffin; we live at Abbey End, Newport Pagnel. I have known George Pearson Barrett several years—he has been in the habit of frequenting Newport Pagnel for fifteen or sixteen months—he lived at a private house at Abbey End there—these things taken from the shop are such as I had seen in his window for sale—I remember Mr. Owen and Carpenter coming down—Barrett's family had removed from Abbey End to Marsh End—the house which the officers searched was the house to which they had removed—I received articles from George Pearson Barrett's wife to pawn, as near as I can recollect on six occasions—her husband has been present on some of the occasions; I cannot say how many—he has also been present when I have brought the money for the pledges, and has said that he would soon have the goods out again—I delivered the tickets to Mrs. Barrett—I pawned in my own name for Barrett.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inmate of Camberwell Workhouse. The prisoner was a nurse there—on 25th March I went into the ward where the prisoner and the children were—the deceased child, Henry Greenaway, was then suffering from diarrhoea—he was about two years old—he had been taken from his mother, in consequence of being ill—she came to see him that day—she asked the prisoner to give him some tea—she gave him a little drop, and he cried for more—she would not give him any more, but hit him a blow in the back with her double fist—the mother was not present then—the prisoner put him into bed, and he went to sleep—it was then between three and four in the afternoon (I was sent there because the other wards were so full, not as nurse)—I slept close by him at night—he was very restless, and awoke frequently—there were five children in his bed—he slept in the middle—he got out of bed and fell over two of the children, and knocked his forehead against the iron of my bedstead—I then took him from the ground—in about five minutes the prisoner came and took him—I said, "Let me have the child"—she said I should not have him, she took him from me, and threw him back to his own bed, saying, "You little villain, lie there!"—I said, "You will kill that poor</p>

               <p>importance)—he was in a state of considerable excitement and fever; the skin was very hot—there were several livid marks on the forehead and tide of the head and face—both arms were covered with bruises and livid marks—there was a contusion on the upper part of the chest on the left side, also a severe bruise on the lower part of the abdomen and the pubis, and several bruises on the anterior and internal part of both thighs—both legs were covered with livid marks, and there were some trifling bruises on the top, and a slight scratch on the back of the head, an abrasion; the skin was broken; it was not bleeding then, it might have bled—he died a short time afterwards—I made a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi> examination; the brain was healthy, but there were five or six ounces of blood extravasated on the back-part of the head—a severe blow on the front of the head would have caused that quantity of extravasated blood at the back—I do not think it would be caused by the bruises on the front of the head themselves; they teemed to be simply pinches—I think if the child had been thrown on the back of its head on a hard substance, that would account for the extravasated blood—I have seen the bolster in the workhouse—if the child was thrown with great violence upon one of them, it might perhaps account for the coagulated blood—after a shock of that kind, the child would appear drowsy and stupified—all the other parts of the body were healthy—in my judgment, the cause of death was the rupture of a blood-vessel, caused by the child being thrown violently against the bed, and striking its head against a hard substance—none of the other bruises would account for death, they might accelerate the circulation a little; that would be merely accessary.</p>

I have not a farthing about me"—I gave all the bad half-crowns to the policeman—I had marked the one that Pugh gave me on the 18th—this is it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lordship-lane, about half a mile from Dulwich. On Saturday morning, 29th March, I missed seven fowls—the footway comes right opposite my house, across the fields, from the Green-lane, about three-quarters of a mile off—my fowls were kept in a cow-house close to the house—I saw six dead fowls the same day at the station—I said there was one more missing—I returned home, and found one dead behind a truss of hay—I knew them perfectly well—I had bad some of them more than twelve months—I used to feed them occasionally—I am a licensed victualler—they are always about my premises—I saw them safe the afternoon before—they had not been locked up that sight—these are the heads; they were cut off in my presence.</p>
