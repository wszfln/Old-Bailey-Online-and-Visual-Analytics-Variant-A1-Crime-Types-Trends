               <p>Q. Did she go into the house?</p>

               <p>Q. Had you called any where going along?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No, I had not; nor spoke to any body in the street besides the prisoner.</p>

               <p>Lewis. I am sure I had it in my pocket when I first met with her. When she went from me she fell a running. I felt in my pocket, and found my large piece of money was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. In which pocket was your money?</p>
               <p>Lewis. It was in my left-hand breeches pocket, and my knee buckles in my right.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon, after you missed your money, was it that you took her?</p>
               <p>Lewis. In about three or four minutes. I found she had her hand clinch'd. She drop'd two shillings and one of my buckles on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her drop them ?</p>
               <p>Lewis. No; but she pointed to it on the ground, under her, and said, there lies your money. I took it up, and said here is not all, I have lost a piece of gold; if you'll give me that you may keep the silver. She said, she had got no gold. I call'd the watch, and he took her to the Round-house. She was searched, but nothing except two halfpence was found upon her.</p>

               <p>Q. Explain what you mean by walk.</p>
               <p>Stanmore. There are two walks, one in Southwark, and the other in the city, which are appointed to certain servants.</p>
               <p>Q. In which walk is Stevens's house?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. That is in the city walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Holmes and you in the city walk?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. No; we had no business to deliver beer to Stevens. Holmes and I took two firkins of ale, about thirteen or fourteen weeks ago, from out of our master's ale store house, from out of a tun; he carried one firkin and I the other, and put them into Stevens's cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any authority from your master so to do?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. It was between six and seven at night, after dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Stevens at the time?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. He was in the cellar along with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he know how you came by it?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. He must know how we came by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any previous discourse with him about it?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. No, I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how came you to carry it there?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. Thinking he would take it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you think so?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. Because we had heard he had taken some in before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him what it was?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. I told him it was ale, as we were taking it down the cellar stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay you for it?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. He did; he gave me five shillings for the two firkins.</p>
               <p>Q. What is that ale worth a firkin ?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. It is worth 7 s. and 6 d. a firkin.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the money?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. I gave Holmes half a crown of it. After that I was informed Holmes had swore something against me, so I went away, for five<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220004"/> weeks or more; after which I returned back, and sent my master word of it, and beg'd my liberty. I met Mr. Cox, our clerk, in Leather-Lane, and told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before you was in custody?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. It was. I had not then been charged with the offence.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Stevens a customer to Mr. Keeling?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. He was, for barrels of ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he sometimes have small beer of your master?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. Sometimes he had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay the men for the ale, or was it book'd?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. He paid the clerk for that, and he paid the men for the small beer, as they carried it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he complain of the badness of the small beer sometimes ?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. Yes, once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How much small beer did he bespeak at a time?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. One firkin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he never bespeak two at one time?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he receive these two for small beer?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. No; I told him it was ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never carry him ale to make him amends, when there has been a complaint made of the badness of the small beer?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say it was all ale, or as good as ale?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. I said it was ale.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you taste it?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he put it in the publick cellar?</p>
               <p>Stanmore. He did; he set it in one corner, and put a bag over it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Keeling. Stanmore and Holmes were partners in the small beer, as draymen. Holmes was foreman in that walk.</p>
               <p>Q. Had either of them any business to deliver beer to Stevens?</p>
               <p>Cox. No, that was the business of other servants that belong'd to the city walk; they frequently used his house, as he kept Mr. Keeling's tap-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Stevens know that Holmes and Stanmore did not belong to the walk he lives in.</p>
               <p>Cox. He certainly must know that, because he knew all our men. I heard Holmes confess before justice Welch that he took away one of the firkins of ale, and Stanmore took the other; but that he carried it no farther than Stevens's cellar door, and Stanmore took it of him, and put it into the cellar.</p>

            . The prisoner Holmes lodged with me. I perceiving him several times to be very uneasy, asked him the reason of it. He would not give me a satisfactory answer. Perceiving him one time to be more so than ordinary, I took him into another room, and asked him again. He said, he chose to leave his place. I said, why? He said, if he did not he should be ruined, for it was a practice among them to take beer out when the clerk and the rest of the people were out of the way, and to make away with it. I asked him why he did not tell his master or Mr. Cox of it? He said, he could not, and that he rather chose to go away, for they would brand him with the name of a tell-tale. Then I said I should be blameable if I did not tell, as I knew of it. He said he should be obliged to me if I would, for he could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did he say were concerned with him?</p>
               <p>Billings. He said Stanmore was concerned with him for one. I sent to the brewhouse and desired Mr. Cox to come to me. He came, to whom I related the account Holmes had told me, and so the matter came out.</p>
               <p>Holmes's Defence.</p>
               <p>I never took away any ale in my life. Please to ask Mr. Billings my character.</p>
               <p>Billings. I never heard any thing amiss of him before this.</p>
               <p>Stevens's Defence.</p>
               <p>I generally have one firkin of small beer after another, for our own use. When I have found fault with the beer the servant has put his finger into the hole, tasted it, and said it would be very good. I have sometimes thrown half a vessel away when it has been bad. I always paid half a crown for a vessel of it, and never knew that it was stolen.</p>

We went there, but there was nobody. He gave me some brandy to drink, and I was a little in liquor. I went into Mr. Priest's barn to lie, but he said he would get me a better lodging than that; so he went into Mrs. Briscoe's house, and I along with him. I had been there all day, and had gone out, but the people were walking about. Then he said, if I did not take something away he would kill me; so I continued there three days. He went out, as he said, being hungry, to get some victuals, and at that time they came and took me.</p>

Some time ago I received intelligence that he kept a girl, and had made her several presents in the linen way, to a large amount, such as gowns, ruffles, aprons, handkerchiefs, and other things, and that he had took her a lodging in the Borough, and had afterwards removed her to this side of the water, and that if I would give myself the trouble to appoint some body to dodge him of nights I should find out where his girl lived, for he always went of an evening to her as soon as the shop was shut up. I had him dodged; it was to a grocer's shop in High-street, Bloomsbury. I found there was a girl that went sometimes by his name, and sometimes by her own; and that sometimes she passed for his wife, and sometimes not. Having missed several things, and could get no intelligence what was become of them, I consulted with Mr. Fielding what was most proper to be done. I got a warrant from him, and went to this grocer's house, on Saturday the 4th of this month, in the evening. We inquired if the girl was at home. There were two constables along with me. We were directed up two pair of stairs, where we found him and his girl together drinking of tea. I had intended to have secured him at my own house that evening, but he slip'd away unknown to me. I had a warrant also to take her up. I did not immediately tell him what I came for, but look'd about, and found some furniture in the room, which I thought to be mine. Then I desired the constable to take him to the coach, and keep him in it, which we had hard by, till I had spoke to the girl. Then I told the girl that the prisoner had rob'd me of some things, and desired she would shew me what things she had got. She shew'd me a great number of things, linen to near the amount of 50 l. we took them and him away. He own'd himself guilty upon my charging him with several things, and that he had rob'd me to a considerable amount of goods, as well as money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you mention the goods laid in the indictment?</p>
               <p>Eyres. I am not certain that I mention'd them. I found every one of these things in his lodging. He call'd this his first fact, and beg'd on his knees that I would be favourable to him, and give him leave to transport himself. I carried him to my house, and insisted upon looking in his box, where I found divers goods, which he own'd he had taken, and that they were my property. He own'd the taking of others also, which he had disposed of. After this I took him to justice Fielding, and he was committed.</p>

            . I am a linen draper, and live at Brentford. I did once live with Mr. Eyres. He acquainted me he had received information that one of his servants kept a girl, to whom he had made presents to a considerable value, particularly printed cottons for gowns, and other wearing apparel, and said he should take it kind of me if I would go along with him to endeavour to take him up. We went together, with two constables, on Saturday evening, the 4th of this month, to High-street, Bloomsbury, and up two pair of stairs, at a grocer's shop, we found the prisoner and the young woman drinking tea together. After some little time, he desir'd that I and one of the constables would go down with the prisoner, and put him in the coach, while he examined the lodgings. I went, and left the prisoner in the coach, under the care of the constable, and returned to the lodging, and found the girl producing the things which Mr. Eyres has mention'd, and said the prisoner brought them there. I likewise heard Mr. Eyres say they were his property. I likewise saw Mr. Eyres's mark upon some of them, which I knew. There was a piece of draper, some cotton, a counterpane, some dimity, some Dutch linen, some muslin, and other things, which were delivered back to Mr. Eyres.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner confess any thing?</p>
               <p>Caldwell. I did. I heard him say it was the first time; he acknowledged the fact, and beg'd for mercy.</p>

               <p>Vaughan. This was in my kitchen. I know the pocket handkerchief to be one of mine, having used it many times. I went and searched her lodgings, where I found one towel and a rubber. (Produced in court.) She beg'd for mercy, and own'd she had taken them.</p>

As I live in the Borough I went to the house of Mr. Leekey, and there staid all night, with one Mr. Lambert that lives there. I went to bed with him, and the next morning I missed my watch. When I got up, about nine or ten o'clock, I inquired in the family if any body knew any thing of it. About a week afterwards another lodger in the house lost his watch, who had a warrant for the prisoner at the bar from justice Pell. I went there also. The justice shew'd me a watch, and ask'd me if it was mine. I said it was. The person that delivered it to the justice (named

            . On the 3d of January last Mr. Scot was invited by a lodger of mine to lie with him, as he was some distance from his home in the Borough. He came in about twelve o'clock, and lay with his friend Mr. Lambert. When he got up in the morning he told me he had lost his watch, and believed he had been rob'd in my house. I desired him to suspend his suspicion, and recollect himself whether he had not left it at home. The next day he came, and said he suspected the prisoner at the bar, who is a tenant at my house, on the same floor where he lay. I went into her room (her husband was not at home) ask'd her if she knew any thing of this watch, and said she was suspected of stealing it. She protested she knew nothing of it. Last Saturday Mrs. Audery, a pawnbroker, came to my house, and went to the prisoner's room, whom I ask'd if she had ever a watch pawn'd in the prisoner's name, or pawn'd by her in any other name. She said she did not know what her husband had done, but she had not took in any of her. Another man that had lost his watch in my house, about a week afterwards, went to Mrs. Audery's, where, I was afterwards informed, Mr. Scot's watch was seen. I went to Mr. Pell the justice, and got a search warrant, who sent for Mrs. Audery; she brought the watch there, and the prosecutor own'd it.</p>

               <p>John Campey. On the 12th of January, at night, I went into the house of Mrs. Morris, in Newtoner's-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it a publick or private house?</p>
               <p>Campey. A private house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Campey. No; I never saw her before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you meet with her?</p>
               <p>Campey. As I was going along in <placeName id="t17580222-11-crimeloc61">St. Giles's</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was you sober ?</p>
               <p>Campey. I was a little in liquor, and was in the room with her about twenty minutes. She went out before me, and as soon as I came out of the house I missed my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had it in that house?</p>
               <p>Campey. She told me to take it out of my fob, and put it in my waistcoat pocket, which I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say at going out of the room?</p>
               <p>Campey. She said nothing at all. I took her up on the 13th at the same house, and carried her before justice Welch, where she confessed the watch was at Mr. Watts's, in St. Giles's. Mr. Watts was sent for, and he brought the watch.</p>

            . The prosecutor sent for me on the 13th of January, and told me a person had pick'd his pocket of his watch. We went to Drury Lane, to inquire for the prisoner, and at last found her; she own'd she had taken the watch from him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watts. (The watch produced in court, and deposed to.) I had this watch delivered to me by Mr. Biggs. I have known the prisoner some time; she is a common street walker.</p>

               <p>Mr. Biggs. Some time in January I heard the prisoner had a watch to sell for a guinea, so I went to her, and asked her how she came by it. She said she found it in the Park. I knowing the woman to be of a loose behaviour stop'd it, and delivered it to Mr. Watts the constable.</p>

I said hallo I saw the prisoner come out of the coach-house, and run down the garden. He got upon a hot bed, with intent to get over the wall, but his feet<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220010"/> struck in it, so that he was obliged to roll over. I got over as soon as he, and laid hold on him. He said he would kill me, and struck me with this hammer (producing one) then I threw him, but he got up again. I threw him three times, in which time he had struck me two blows with the hammer on my head, but by the assistance of the moon I saw it and catch'd his arm, so that it only stun'd me a little. At last I got the hammer out of his hand, and said you have given me two or three blows, I'll give you two or three. So I gave him two or three hearty ones, which settled him. Then I call'd Nathan, a Jew, whose window was near us. He came with a sword to my assistance, and his wife call'd the watch, who came and took him to the watch house. I had fastened that door over night, and I found it with the lock broke, and the door forced.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this coach-house belong to the dwelling house?</p>
               <p>Wade. It is at the bottom of my father's garden. There are goods, such as beds and houshold goods in it, but it is twenty yards from the dwelling house.</p>

             the elder. It is my house that was broke open. I lock'd one lock myself over night, which I found broke open, the heads of the nails were eat off, they remained in the lock, and the points of them remained in the door to the coach house; it was an iron plate lock, with a hasp. There was another lock broke besides that; the stable and the coach-house join, there is a door out of one into the other, and they reach from one end of the garden to within twenty yards of the dwelling-house, in the same inclosure.</p>

            . Last Thursday was a month as I was in bed I heard somebody call very weakly, Nathan, Nathan, Nathan, in the back place, which is our burying ground; I am a Jew, and have the care of it; this was between one and two at night.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does your house stand?</p>
               <p>Nathan. It stands just by Mr. Wade's garden. I stept out of bed, and from a little back window I saw two men struggling in our burying ground, about six or eight yards from the wall under my window. I said what is the matter. Mr. Wade said for God's sake come down, or I shall be kill'd, for I have got a thief. My wife hearing it, call'd out thieves, murder, &amp;c. to alarm the neighbourhood. I ran down stairs, and took a sword, with nothing but my great coat on. There I found Mr. Wade, junior, upon the prisoner; he was all bloody on his forehead, with the hammer in his hand. I said to the prisoner, if you offer to stir, I'll run you through. There came in a watchman and Mr. Child. Then I said to the prisoner, how came you to come here to surprise people at this time of the night. He said I was coming to take that which was not my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr. Wade by at that time?</p>
               <p>Nathan. I believe he was not at that time, he was gone to dress himself. We took the prisoner to the watch-house, and after that to justice Bury, but he would not acknowledge any thing. As we were coming back from the justice's, he said he lay under a hay stack, and it was very damp, and he got over the wall to see for some barn or place where he might lie; but there is a shed in our place, in which he could have got to lie, without going over that wall, which is seven feet high.</p>

Soon after the prisoner Coe came, who asked me if I belong'd to the green skist. I said, yes. He said, fetch it out; those were his words: he did not say what. I did, and carried it half way to the corner of Love Lane, to an alehouse, when Coe took it. He went with me all the way, and carried it into the alehouse.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he know what it was?</p>
               <p>Hammock. I don't know that he did; he went down into the cellar, and I carried the bag after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body go with you?</p>
               <p>Hammock. No, we were there alone. He unlock'd a cupboard in the cellar, took out a pair of stilliards, and weigh'd it; it weigh'd forty-three pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him open the bag to look at it?</p>
               <p>Hammock. I am not sure. We allowed him four pounds for the bag. I know he emptied it out of the bag after he had paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to give you for it?</p>
               <p>Hammock. He was to give half a crown a pound for it, and paid for thirty nine pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay you in the cellar?</p>
               <p>Hammock. He did. Then he put it in the cupboard where he took the stilliards from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what sort of stuff it was when you took it out of the chest?</p>

               <p>Q. Had you a right to sell it?</p>
               <p>Hammock. No.</p>

               <p>Hammock. Not a word as I remember.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is it from Bear-Key to that ale-house?</p>
               <p>Hammock. It may be four or five hundred yards distance.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to row to Bear-Key ?</p>
               <p>Hammock. I was to row to some private place, and Maclockline was to have come to me again.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the prisoner to mention the word it?</p>
               <p>Hammock. Because Maclockline had sent him, and, I suppose, had told him of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you suppose so?</p>
               <p>Hammock. Because he went on shore to help me to a chap, and the prisoner came and asked me if I belong'd to the green skift.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the actual sum that you received, and in what sort of money?</p>
               <p>Hammock. Some of it was gold, but I cannot say how much it amounted to; he paid me for thirty-nine pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with it?</p>
               <p>Hammock. We did not share it till we went over the water.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you for your share?</p>
               <p>Hammock. I had 4 l or some such matter, for my share.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of you shared that?</p>
               <p>Hammock. There were but two of us that had that. We sold another parcel to the prisoner, and this money was for both parcels.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not you in the Poultry Compter?</p>
               <p>Hammock. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether there was not a person in the same compter for debt, named Ascue, at that time?</p>
               <p>Hammock. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you some conversation with him about this affair?</p>
               <p>Hammock. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether or not you told him there was a necessity for you to transport this man at the bar, or you should be transported yourself?</p>

               <p>Q. Did any others hear that as well as you?</p>
               <p>George. There were many that I believe heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he speak it publickly, or only to Coe?</p>
               <p>George. He spoke it to the whole company, not to Coe in particular,</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Coe say any thing to him about it?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220013"/>George. Coe said he would give him 2 s. and 6 d. per pound for it, and then he should get but 2 d. per pound by it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this in the publick room?</p>
               <p>George. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Hammock do with that bag which you supposed to have corn in?</p>
               <p>George. He laid it down on the ground in the tap room.</p>
               <p>Q. Privately, or in a publick manner?</p>
               <p>George. It was in the publick room.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did it lie there?</p>
               <p>George. I believe it lay there five minutes before it was taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it carried to?</p>

               <p>George. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you saw either Hammock or Coe go down into the cellar?</p>
               <p>George. No; I did not see either of them go down.</p>
               <p>Q. Do mates of Indiamen bring adventures?</p>
               <p>George. They do often; I have bought things of them myself.</p>
               <p>Q. As this was brought into the publick room, as you mention, should you have been willing to have bought it?</p>
               <p>George. I should, if I could have got my thing by it.</p>
               <p>Council for prosecution. Whether you have not, since this prosecution has been depending, declared you saw Mr. Coe light a candle, and he and Hammock go down into the cellar ?</p>

               <p>Whiteman. I am an assistant elder, and have the care of the landing and shipping of goods at Botolph-Wharf. I was ordered to go with Mr. Bean in search of some shellack, which was said to be missing out of a lighter from the Eastcourt Indiaman. On Hammock's confessing this robbery, before Mr. alderman Kite, we went, and a constable with us, to the Rose and Crown, at the corner of Love-Lane, to search for it, where we open'd a place, on the left-hand side in the cellar, and found only three or four stilliard weights. This is all I know of the matter.</p>
               <p>Q. What price did shellack bear at that time?</p>

               <p>Q. What price did it bear in November, 1756?</p>
               <p>Fidges. Some, I believe, sold for thirty pounds per hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the middling price?</p>
               <p>Fidges. There was some sold for twenty-three, twenty four, and twenty-five pounds a hundred. I bought a lot then for twenty-seven pounds, ten shillings, which is about four shillings a pound, and the finest sort is worth about four shillings and sixpence a pound. The last sale it sold from nineteen to twenty-three pounds a hundred.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you buy it before the duty is paid or after?</p>

            . I live in Swallow's-Gardens, Goodman's-Fields. I was at the Rose and Crown when Mr. Coe was in company with Lambeth and Maclockline. I saw him and two men making a bargain about something, but I did not know what it was; one of the two said he could help him to some shellack. Mr. Coe asked him how he came by it. He said he had it of a mate of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220014"/> an Indiaman. Mr. Coe asked him what he would have per pound for it. Presently in came a young fellow with some stuff in a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know that young man was you to see him?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. I believe I should.</p>
               <p>Q. Look about the court, and see if you can find him?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. (She look'd about and pitch'd upon Hammock.) I believe this is he.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. I work slop work for Mr. Bonus in Thomas Street, and was waiting there for work, as sometimes I do for an hour or two. This young man laid the bag down by the side of the table. Mr. Coe took some of it out, and look'd at it, and said half a crown a pound was the worth of it, and he would not give more. They concluded upon it for that price. Then they both of them went out, and brought in some more in a handkerchief and in their pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it weigh'd?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. I did. It was all weigh'd in that room, on the dark side of it, not that side the windows are on, with stilliards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they go down into the cellar?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. They did not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the stilliards taken from?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. I can't say that.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any other people in the room besides those you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. There were several other people. there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it weigh'd publickly?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. It was quite publick, every body might see it.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was you at that alehouse?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. I was there three or four hours. I am obliged to wait sometimes, as I work for the navy.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you there before Mr. Coe came in?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. No, he was there when I went in.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the two men you mention come in?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. They came in after I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before ?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. No, they were intire strangers to me.</p>
               <p>Q. When did Mr. Coe go away?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. He staid there all the time I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not go out of the house during the time you was there?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what the shellack weigh'd?</p>
               <p>L. Maryate. I did not see what it weigh'd.</p>
               <p>John Ascue. I saw this witness Hammock in the Poultry Compter, being an unfortunate debtor there at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live now?</p>
               <p>Ascue. I now keep the Swan alehouse at Battersea. I remember I had some conversation with him about his giving evidence against the prisoner at the bar, and upon my seeing his commitment I said to him; this is a very bad affair, which will be of a bad consequence.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he committed for?</p>
               <p>Ascue. He was committed for feloniously stealing of shellack. He said what can I do, I will sooner by half transport all the world than I will transport myself. I said in what manner did you offer it to sale, he said he had it of a mate of a ship, whose private adventure it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you he told Mr. Coe that he had it of the mate of a ship?</p>
               <p>Ascue. He said he did tell him that, and more than that he offered to lay several sums of money that he would transport Mr. Coe, and get himself off.</p>

               <p>Q. to Hammock. You hear what Ascue has sworn, what say you to it?</p>
               <p>Hammock. Upon my oath I never had that conversation with him as he has mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever talk about this affair with him?</p>
               <p>Hammock. No, I never did at all.</p>

               <p>Hammock. No, I did not; for I took it out of the chest myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever offer to lay any money about transporting the prisoner?</p>

               <p>Ascue. What I have sworn is truth. There is a gentleman here that heard him say some of the words I mention'd.</p>
               <p>Court. What is his name?</p>
               <p>Ascue. I don't know; I saw him when he was giving evidence, and knew him again.</p>
               <p>Court. Then go and lay your hand on him. (He goes down, and laid his hand on Connup.) This is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Connup. Do you recollect, this conversation?</p>
               <p>Connup. I never saw this evidence before I saw him here in my life; he must be mistaken.</p>

               <p>- Priest. I live at Brentford. On the 19th of January the prisoner at the bar brought a leaden pump, with two nossels, to my mistress to sell. She suspecting it to have been stolen, would not buy it, without he'd bring somebody to his character. He went, pretending to bring somebody, but he came no more. Then my mistress had it cried, and the prosecutor came on the Tuesday night and claim'd it.</p>

               <p>Andrew Seymore. I keep an oil shop at Ratcliff-cross. On the 14th of January the prisoner came and asked me if I would buy some Stockholm tar, which he said he would sell at 18 s. per barrel. I told him I would give him 18 s. per barrel. He brought three barrels in a cart. It appeared to be what they call plantation tar. I offered him 9 s. a barrel for it, in order to try him, suspecting he had stole it. I asked him how he came by it. He said a young man desired him to sell it for him. I stop'd it, and advertised it, by which means the right owner came to the knowledge of it, but I not having paid for it, the prisoner sued me for the money.</p>
               <p>Captain Robson. There was a quantity of tar that lay in a lighter at Iron-Gate, the property of

             and Co. Some of it being missing, upon its being advertised I went to Seymore's house and saw it; it was the same that was missing from the lighter. The prisoner was secured, and taken before justice Berry, where he confessed his taking it out of the lighter.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the confession taken in writing?</p>
               <p>Robson. It was [ Produced in court, and the hand-writing of the justice and prisoner proved. It was then read, in which the prisoner acknowledged he did steal it, and carry it to the house of Seymore, &amp;c.]</p>

               <p>Lomas. No, I have not. About the beginning of last December I employ'd the prisoner to make me six-shirts, after which I soon set out into the country, and returned in about six weeks after. Then I went to the prisoner to know if she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220017"/> made my linen. She said she had made three of them. I desired she would bring them, that I might see how they were made to sit. She seemed to tremble much, and said she could not bring them till the morrow. She not bringing them to her word. I sent my servant for them, but she was not to be found. At last she was brought. I told her I perceived by her behaviour that she had pawned them, and if she had, and would take me to the pawnbroker's, I would fetch them out, and forgive her. She took me to Mr. Brown, a pawnbroker on Snow-Hill, and asked for two shirts that she had pawn'd there, which were produced, and I took them out. Then she took me to a second pawnbroker, and asked for two more. I took them out. Then she took me to a third, and asked for one, which I took out.</p>
               <p>Q. What were they pawn'd for?</p>
               <p>Lomas. I paid, I think, three shillings for the two first, four shillings for the other two, and three shillings and six pence, or four shillings for the single one. I said, what must I do for the sixth shirt? She said, she would consider what she had done with that. I went again to Mr. Brown, and desired him to examine his books, to see what he had taken in of her, which he did, and found many things; among which were five shirts more of mine that I had missed, but have not charged her with taking them. (He produced the seventy-five yards of linen she was charged with, three pieces of twenty-five yards each. ) She had cut two of them into a variety of pieces, but one was whole, which I can swear to. She acknowledged them all to be mine.</p>

            . I rented a room of the prisoner Watson. Some time in September last I missed a large silver spoon, two pair of laced ruffles, one pair of plain, two silk handkerchiefs, one remnant of Irish cloth, one apron, a yard of lace, and a body of a shift, from out of my room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your room door lock'd ?</p>
               <p>Constantine. It was. I had no reason to suspect either of the prisoners till Duncan came on the 24th of January and told me of it. She said she had taken the goods, and would tell me where they were. She went with me to a silversmith just by Wapping Chapel, where I found the silver spoon; and then to a pawnbroker's in Nightingale-Lane, St. John's, Wapping; where she said she had pawn'd the laced ruffles for two shillings, but the pownbroker denied them. I found an apron and the yard of lace in Watson's house, upon the information of Duncan.</p>
               <p>Q. In what part of the house did you find them ?</p>
               <p>Constantine. Mrs. Watson gave me them out of her own hands. I took her before the justice, and she own'd the taking of all the things; and they both told me they had each of them had a cap made of the Irish linen, and the muslin ruffles served for borders to the caps.</p>

            . I had left some tools and things at Mr. Carey's house while I went into the country. When I returned, I missed a strong screw belonging to an engine lath, which was to fasten the bank to the bench. I was inform'd by Mr. Carey, that it was at Mr. Lloyd's, a blacksmith. I went and found it there the 9th of this month.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lloyd. I bought this screw and plate of the prisoner at the bar about the beginning of July last. I informed Mr. Carey of it, suspecting the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carey. Mr. Hopson left these things with others in my care. I put them in my garret, and they were taken away.</p>

               <p>Carey. He has lodged in my house several years, and the garret door was not always lock'd.</p>

The landlord of the house said it was too late to draw it, so I took his answer and went out. The prisoner and another woman were coming out at the same time; they laid hold of me, and forced me with them.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the other woman's name?</p>
               <p>Foster. They called her Jenny. I went with them to a private house where they lodged, at a place call'd Hog-Yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you sober?</p>
               <p>Foster. I was a little elevated.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other woman go into the room with you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Foster. She did, staid about a quarter of an hour, and then went out.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you had your watch when you went into their company?</p>
               <p>Foster. I am sure I had it at the time of my going into the house with them, for I felt it in my fob after I was in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you it in your pocket after the other woman was gone out of the room?</p>
               <p>Foster. I had, and missed it about a quarter of an hour after she was gone; I staid there all night.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to do so after you missed your watch?</p>
               <p>Foster. Because the prisoner had left me in the house with nobody but a little girl, so I staid there, and in the morning I inquired at the Three-Compasses. I was afraid I should not find the house again if I went away in the dark.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any other person come into your company, besides the prisoner, between the time the other woman went out and your missing the watch?</p>
               <p>Foster. There was nobody with me in that time but the prisoner at the bar, whom I met with at the Three-Compasses the next day, and charged her with taking my watch. She said she had pawn'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give or lend it to her?</p>
               <p>Foster. I did neither; she took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you consent to her taking it?</p>
               <p>Foster. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the value of it?</p>
               <p>Foster. It is a silver watch, value 4 l 4 s. with the silver chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the time she took it?</p>
               <p>Foster. No. I challenged her with taking it as we were on the bed, and she left me immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you leave this watch in pawn for 12 s.?</p>
               <p>Foster. No,</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you lie with me all night?</p>
               <p>Foster. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. Did not you leave it in pawn with my landlady?</p>
               <p>Foster. No; there was no landlady in the house but you. I don't know whose house it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the prisoner any thing?</p>
               <p>Foster. I gave her a shilling.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 6th of February I was sent for to the Three-Compasses, where the prosecutor charged me with the prisoner (she was charged with having his watch ) who<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220022"/> did not disown having it, but said it was in pawn, but would not say where. We courted her much to tell us where it was, but she used us with much ill manners. We took her before the justice, who asked her where she had pawn'd the watch, but she would not tell. He made her mittimus, and we were to carry her to New-Prison, Clerkenwell. When we came near the Tower Gaol she said, Constable, if you will go in here I will help the prosecutor to his watch; if he will give me a shilling. I will go and fetch it, it is but three or four doors off. I would not part from her. Then she stooped down, took it out of her stocking, near the calf of her leg, and delivered it to me. (Produced in court, and deposed to by the prosecutor.)</p>

               <p>My landlady lying in, I took care of the house. He came and asked for me, sat down on my knee, and said, Kitty, I have not seen you a good while; how do you do? He said he had no money, so he pawned his watch for twelve shillings with my landlady. We had three bottles of wine, a crown he gave me for laying with him all night, and a shilling for the bed. He had been with me three or four times before.</p>

             and my wife looking out something for the two prisoners in the shop. Cole asked for worsted blue chevron'd hose, but they could not find them. Then Cole said I am going up the market, I'll call as I come back. As soon as they were gone my man said, what have they bought. I said, nothing. Then, said he, they have stole a pair of rib'd grey hose, which lay upon a bundle, and shew'd me the bundle. I had seen them when I came into the shop, lying on the counter, right before the prisoners. At that time I did not miss<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220023"/> any thing else. My servant went after them, and brought them into the shop in about a minute or two, they having not been gone above forty or fifty yards. I charged them with robbing me of a pair of stockings, and shew'd them the place where they took them from. Mathews, otherwise Cole, denied it, and said she never did such a thing in her life. The other prisoner said nothing. I told them I'd have them search'd. I was going to turn myself about, and saw Cole drop this bundle, and these two pair of worsted stockings. (Producing a paper parcel and two pair of loose stockings.) She would have came near to the counter, but I would not let her, and she was moving towards the other end of the shop. (Mine is a long shop.)</p>
               <p>Q. How near was she when you saw the stockings and parcel to the place where you saw the stockings lying on the counter?</p>
               <p>Newton. It was about two or three yards distance. She pull'd off her capuchine, and laid it down. I saw the stockings in her hand, and the paper parcel fall down, which came to the ground first, and the stockings just after them. Then she desired to be searched. I pull'd her on one side, and took them up from under her, and said there is no occasion to search you now. for here they are.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they fall from her, or the other prisoner?</p>
               <p>Newton. The other prisoner was not near her, she was a yard or two from her. Cole then sell down on her knees, and beg'd for mercy, and said it was the first fact she ever committed. I carried them and the goods to justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the other prisoner say any thing upon your finding the stockings under Cole?</p>
               <p>Newton. She beg'd I would shew Cole mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose property is the paper parcel and stockings ?</p>
               <p>Newton. They are stockings my property, marked with my own name. The two pair of loose stockings are also my property. Justice Fielding, having knowledge of them, would not trust them to go to gaol with the constable, but sent for a file of musqueteers, saying Cole was a very dangerous person. She there intirely denied the fact.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they come back without hesitation?</p>
               <p>Newton. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so particular as to your stockings?</p>
               <p>Newton. There is my name on them, which I put on them when I send them to the trimmers.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your servant say upon this ?</p>
               <p>Newton. He said upon seeing the bundle, that is the bundle that I took down for them to look at.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not Cole been first searched before you found the bundle?</p>
               <p>Newton. It was all done in a minute. When I charged her with the fact, Cole began to shuffle her things about, and the things sell as I before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give the same account before the justice?</p>
               <p>Newton. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not she in the back room before you found the goods?</p>
               <p>Newton. No. She was to have been taken in to be searched, but upon their being found I did not take her in there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was your man at this time?</p>
               <p>Newton. He was almost at the upper end of the counter at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you declare you found these goods on the ground?</p>
               <p>Newton. I took them up from off the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you declared you believed you was mistaken, and that you thought this Cole was not the woman?</p>
               <p>Newton. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you should get a couple of Tyburn tickets if you could convict them?</p>
               <p>Newton. No, I never did. I could have had 200 l. if I would not have prosecuted.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know you could?</p>
               <p>Newton. There were people came and offered me money if I would have comply'd so to do.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were they?</p>
               <p>Newton. One was a little fellow; and one Scot came to my shop last week, who said he came from Tobin, and desired much to know if I would meet him at any house, and said, we can get you 200 l. if you will not prosecute, and said you had better not find the bill.</p>
               <p>Court. Who do you call next?</p>
               <p>Newton. I did intend to have call'd my servant Elvington, but he has absconded, and I have a warrant against him to take him up; but as one of the prisoner's friends has acquainted the court, when I knew not where to find him, that he was in the gallery, and wants him to be examined, I rather chuse that he be not examined, for I verily believe he has been bribed.</p>
               <p>Court. As he is here, we'll examine him, but not as a witness for the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>He is sworn.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to leave his service?</p>
               <p>Elvington. For a very good reason; I did not approve of his place, nor his goings on.</p>

               <p>Elvington. I did, they came in and asked for some worsted clock'd stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this?</p>
               <p>Elvington. Between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. I had been but a small time in the place, and was not very read at serving My master had been out, and my mastress came home first; immediately after he came, and I desired him to come and serve the gentlewomen himself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been servant there?</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you take down a parcel to shew them?</p>
               <p>Elvington. Yes, I did, but I did not know what was in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more lying on the counter at the time?</p>
               <p>Elvington. There were a great many more there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open any paper?</p>
               <p>Elvington. No. I did not, but there were several lay open upon the counter. When my master and mistress came in, I went back to my frame to work, at the as farther end of the shop. My master had given me a caution to be watchful when any body came in, to see that they took nothing. I saw

               <p>Elvington. This was while master was looking for the stockings she asked for. He could not find them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her touch any of the stockings?</p>
               <p>Elvington. She might touch some of them that lay on the counter. I did not see her take any in her hand.</p>

                  </persName>
             at that time?</p>
               <p>Elvington. She was standing at a distance from the counter. Master being uneasy that he could not find the stockings, pull'd down many papers, and filled the counter very full. Mrs. Cole said, we are going up the market, and when we come back may be you may find them. Then she they went both away. After they were gone, I observed a pair of grey rib'd stockings that had lain on a bundle were missing. Then I asked my master if he had shifted them, he said no. Then I said I apprehended the women had taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at one of these loose pairs?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I believe these may be them, they lay upon a bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that bundle near where Cole stood?</p>
               <p>Elvington. They were pretty near her.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the outside of this bundle. Do you remember whether this lay on the counter?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I can't really say, but I believe it might Master desired me to fetch them back. I went and desired them to come back, which they did very willingly. Then master charged them with taking a pair of stockings, and insisted upon their being searched. Immediately Ann Cole pull'd off her cloak and apron, and desired to go into the little room, to be searched. At the same time master was on the opposite side of the counter. He leap'd over the counter, and took up those stockings from behind a rail where were some old stockings to hang for a shew, and said you need not to search any farther, for I have found them again on the ground [holding the stockings up at the same time] I believe these to be the same, except he has changed them since I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts did he take them up from?</p>
               <p>Elvington. He found them behind the door, at the upper end of the shop, behind a rail that lay on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the women at the time?</p>
               <p>Elvington. They were near the door then, not a great way off.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I believe she was near a yard from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at the time ?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I was on the same side of the counter that he was on, close to the women.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the women all the time?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I did, very diligently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the stockings on the ground before your master took them up?</p>
               <p>Elvington. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see them?</p>
               <p>Elvington. When my master had them in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know that he had pick'd them up?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220025"/>Elvington. According to his own words. He said you need not search any farther, for I have found them here upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to say they were behind the rail, if you did not see them upon the ground ?</p>
               <p>Elvington. He said they lay there himself, and the rail lay near that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose stockings are these?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I believe they are my master's property. On the 10th of February I was at work in my frame. Master came, and with several protestations told me, he would prosecute the two prisoners to the utmost of his power, and desired me to do the same, saying, we shall have two Tyburn tickets, which will be worth 10 l. each, and he would give me one of them. Then he asked me if I saw the prisoner Cole drop the stockings. I said no, I did not. His answer to me was, no more did I, but sure enough they had them, and I'll prosecute them to the utmost of my power; which gave me a great concern to think he should go to Mr. Fielding, and give his evidence against them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put them on the ground?</p>
               <p>Elvington. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any body that did?</p>
               <p>Elvington. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Council for Prisoner. Did you watch the prisoners narrowly.</p>
               <p>Elvington. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When they were brought back again, what did your master say to them?</p>
               <p>Elvington. He said there are a pair of stockings missing, and my man is apprehensive you have got them, and I insist upon your being searched.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. Did you see one of the women fall on her knees.</p>
               <p>Elvington. No, I did not, neither of them. I heard my mistress say Cole did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you close to them all the time?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I was.</p>
               <p>Council for Prisoner. Did you hear Cole beg for mercy?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I heard her beg for God's sake not to be taken before a magistrate, for she had a family of children, and was a poor woman.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. You say they both came in willingly.</p>
               <p>Elvington. They did, and Cole pull'd off her apron and cloak, and threw them on the counter in the shop, and desired to go into the little room to be searched, and in a moment's time after my master found the goods upon the ground, but I can't say whether he got over the counter, or lean'd over it, to take them up.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. Do you think if the woman had drop'd the stockings as your master has related, you should have seen them fall?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I really think I should.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. When they were charged with this fact, what did the prisoners say?</p>
               <p>Elvington. They denied it absolutely.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. Did they continue to do so?</p>
               <p>Elvington. They did, I never heard them acknowledge it.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. Did you continue in the shop as long as they were there?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I did, and went with them before justice Fielding.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. Did you on the 10th of February, or any other time, hear him declare his being mistaken?</p>
               <p>Elvington. No, only he told Mr. Fielding he saw them drop, and told me he did not see them drop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to your master when they went out of the shop ?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I went to him, and said, have you shifted a pair of rib'd stockings from this place, he said no, then I said I am apprehensive those women have taken them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you apprehend so?</p>
               <p>Elvington. Because I had seen a pair of stockings lying there open, and when they were gone I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Council for prisoner. Is it not an easy matter, where there are a great number of stockings, for 2 pair to drop on the floor?</p>
               <p>Elvington. Since this has happened I have seen stockings drop on the ground by customers, unperceived by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she not mention the word fact?</p>
               <p>Elvington. No, not to my knowledge, she did not mention that word. I am sure I never heard her.</p>

            . On the 14th of this instant I went down to New-Prison along with the prosecutor, to the two prisoners at the bar. Mrs. Scot was there (she lives in the parish of St. Giles's ) who said, before the two prisoners should be hurt she could produce seventeen hundred pounds, and would spend it all.</p>
               <p>Q. to Elvington. Do you know Mrs. Scot?</p>
               <p>Elvington. My master took me to New-Prison; that was the first time I ever saw her.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen her since?</p>
               <p>Elvington. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>John Hall. Elvington lodged with me that very night that he had been with the two prisoners to Justice Fielding, and told me that he had seen one of the women drop the stockings, and that he would prosecute them along with his master.</p>
               <p>Q. to Elvington. What do you say to this ?</p>
               <p>Elvington. I never said such a thing.</p>
               <p>Cole's Defence.</p>
               <p>This pair of hose which he says he found on the ground, he found amongst the rest of the stockings lying there. When they brought me back he ask'd me if I had taken a pair of rib'd hose. I put off my cardinal and apron, untied my petticoats, as far as I could modestly, and said, what would you have me do? look among your stockings, and see if you can find them; which he did, and found them lying on the counter. The man said, here is the hose. Said the master here is another pair missing. Then I insisted on going into the room to be searched. I went to the door, and untied my petticoats, to be searched by his wife. He walked to the upper end of the counter, and said, here is a bundle of stockings and a pair of hose.</p>

            . I have been with Mr. Newton the prosecutor frequently since this affair.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>White. I am a grocer, and know the prosecutor, who lives in the passage coming up from Clare-Market; he bears but a very slender character: he attends Mr. Fielding's office, in regard to apprehending people, and I find he has received bounty-money for such. On the Monday after this affair happen'd I was in company with him, and also the next day. At the first time I heard him declare to several people in the publick room, at the Three Tuns in Clare Market, that he did not know whether he was right in the affair; but said, he should be very glad if he could have restitution for the goods he had lost.</p>
               <p>Q. On what account did he think he was not right?</p>
               <p>White. He said there were two other women there buying goods at the time, besides the two women at the bar, and he could not tell how it was; but wish'd he was not mistaken.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was present at this declaration ?</p>
               <p>White. There were several people, but I know none in particular; it is a house that I generally call to drink at when I go that way. He said he would take any thing that was offered him, if he could do it with safety, but he was under the direction of Mr. Fielding. Next day I was with him at 2 or 3 places; he said he was sorry for what he had done, but he dared not to run counter to what Mr. Fielding had ordered him to do. And at the Blakeney's-Head, near justice Fielding's, he said he had carried it on a great length, but he could do no otherwise, fearing he should lie under the displeasure of Mr. Fielding, for what reason I can't tell; there were Mr. Saunders, Mrs. Hawkins, and Mrs. Barrow by at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>White. I live in Old-street, at the corner of Brick-Lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a housekeeper?</p>
               <p>White. I am, and keep another house in Clerkenwell, in another branch of business.</p>
               <p>Q. What business is that?</p>
               <p>White. I make grease and tar for coach and cart wheels.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Newton before this?</p>
               <p>White. I never saw him in my life before I overheard his discourse at the Three Tuns, as he was forcing his discourse to people in the kitchen, not to me. Then I talk'd with him on the affair.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be in company with him at two or three places?</p>
               <p>White. Because these women were going to have a hearing at justice Fielding's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of them before?</p>
               <p>White. Cole and her husband have been acquainted with me several years; they are of good character, and I having a regard for the woman, was willing to go and hear it; it was in regard to her husband, he being a particular acquaintance. I believe he has left her support enough to carry her to her grave without doing this.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Elvington before this?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220027"/>White. I never saw him before this.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a grocer?</p>
               <p>White. About a year.</p>
               <p>Q. What was you before?</p>
               <p>White. I dealt in tar and grease some years.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in that house where you keep a grocer's shop?</p>
               <p>White. I have lived there about eight years.</p>

            . I was in company with Mr. White and Newton, at the Three Tuns, about three weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What discourse passed between them ?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. Newton said if the prisoners would satisfy him with 10 l. for the goods he had lost, he would not bring a bill against them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Newton there before or after you?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. He was in the house before I went in; they were talking about the affair, but I did not listen much about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Repeat the words you heard him say?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. He said if Cole would make him a recompence of 10 l. he would not bring a bill of indictment against her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known Cole?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. I have known her above ten years; her husband was an honourable gentleman. I am sure she was never guilty of such a thing in her life.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her general character?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. I never heard any thing but the best of characters of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where has she lived?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. In Morefields.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts ?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. Just by the square.</p>
               <p>Q. What square do you mean?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. A place of all fine houses.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at her house there?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. I have, many a time.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade is she of?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. She was a shopkeeper when I nursed her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. Above ten years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her often since?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. I have been in company with her every month.</p>
               <p>Q. When was you at her house last?</p>
               <p>E. Barrow. I have not been there these twelve months.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade did she carry on in her shop?</p>

The gentlewoman last examined was along with the prosecutor, who came, call'd me out, and said, what must I do in this affair? he can't make me prosecute unless I have a mind. I said, I wish you would speak to the other people, I know nothing of it. After that the women at the bar were committed. He has been at our house several times since, and call'd me out, to know what proposal they would make, whether they would give him any thing to make it up. I went to the woman on the first day by his direction, and said, do you think to give him any thing? sessions draws nigh. Cole said, a rogue, how can he come to me? if I had a thousand pounds, I would give him nothing. I told him what she said. Then he said, d - n her, I'll prosecute her.</p>

The boy driving very fast, the man galloped by the side of the chaise twenty yards, and when he came against the postillion he stop'd him. I was sitting on the off side. Then I saw a blue great coat sleeve, with a hand and a pistol in it, on that side on which I sat. I found that man also was craped, as the other was. He was on a grey horse. I immediately let down the glass of the chaise, knowing very well what the presenting of a pistol meant. I gave him my money in a purse, about ten or eleven guineas, and my watch, which was a gold one. Presently the man that had stop'd us came to the chaise side. Then the post boy was order'd to drive up a lane on the right hand side, going to Staines. The lane is about three quarters of a mile long. After we were near half way up it, they ordered the cha ise to stop, then they took away my two pistols, and said they were sure I had a great deal more money with me, and began to parley with me. He on the grey horse dismounted. I said in the condition I was, it would be rediculous in me to oppose them, and that I had no more that was sufficient for my travelling expences, I had a trunk with my cloaths behind the chaise, and one of them ordered my servant to give him the key of it. He opened it, and said to them, here is nothing but my master's wearing apparel. They examined it, and found it so. They asked me where I had taken the chaise, I said it was Mr. Day's at the post office. They asked me my name, I told them. Then they asked me if I was brother to a member of parliament of that name, I said no. I having notes about me, and fearing they should search me, I pull'd out about twenty or thirty shillings in silver, and said, I have got some silver if you'll have it. The man on the grey horse said he scorned to take any silver. Then I desired him to take a crown for a bowl of punch, so he took it. After that they desired me to stop a little while, or not to drive too fast. I should know my pistols again, could I see them. They were made by Freeman, his name is on them, mounted with silver screw barrels, but I never saw them since. They were with me twelve minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I can say nothing to the prisoner, having no idea of the men at all, nor even their sizes. I never saw the watch since.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Webb. We were travelling last March to Staines. Two men came up, one on a dark horse, the other on a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220029"/> grey one, one stop'd the postillion, and the other came up to the chaise; they had crape before their faces, so I could not distinguish their faces. One of them had a blue great coat, the other a light great coat. They took my master's watch and purse, and ordered the postillion to drive up a bye lane. Then one of them ask'd me for my pistols. I told him they were in the chaise. He took them. One of them said my master had more money, but my master said he had no more. I said, Gentlemen, I am but a servant, I have no money. One of them ask'd me for the key of the trunk that was behind the chaise, and bid me open it, which I did, and said there was nothing but my master's cloaths. They look'd in, but took nothing. My master pull'd some silver out, and said, Gentlemen, here it is, if you'll take some silver. One of them said he scorned to take silver. Master persuaded him to take a crown for a bowl of punch. After they had asked my master's name they went away, and ordered the postillion to drive softly. I don't know which way they went when they got into the road. I could not distinguish their faces. I know one was taller than the other.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner near twenty years. He was born at Hampton. I lived there upwards of three years. In March last, about the latter end, I and the prisoner at the bar set out from London, in order to commit robberies. His horse had been stopt before, and I being quite an unsuspected person, as he was afraid to walk the streets on another affair, I hired horses for us both. This we had agreed upon. I brought the first horse to him between seven and eight o'clock to a publick house at Marybone. He went there to wait for me, and he carried the arms, three brace of pistols. I saw him look out at the window. I went softly on, he came out, and took the horse, which was a blackish one. Then I came back to Mr. Leader's, at the bottom of Red Lion-street, Holbourn. There I took a grey horse for myself. I believe I got to the farthest sign of the Hatts in Oxford Road between ten and eleven o'clock, the prisoner was to stay for me there. I saw him, and he saw me. I call'd for some liquor at the door, and after that rode on. He soon followed me, and took me into Hounslow road. Then we agreed one should go to one inn, and the other to another. These were little inns before we came to Hounslow. I went to that nearest Hounslow. We were to wait till we found something worthy to attack. When he saw such, he was to come out, and I to mount and follow him. I sat forward, so that I could not miss seeing him as he came along. Presently came a post chaise, and soon after I saw him coming along. He passed me about ten minutes after the chaise did. Then I got my horse ready, and rode after him. We followed the chaise over Hounslow Heath. It was I believe between twelve and one o'clock when we set out from those inns. I join'd him on the Heath, and followed the chaise into Belfound-lane. Then he rode up, and ordered the postillion to stop. The gentleman in it pull'd out a small gold watch, and gave it to him. I rode up to the chaise, and demanded the gentleman's money. He gave it me in a green purse, about ten or eleven guineas, I am sure it was one of them. Then the prisoner ordered the postillion to drive up a lane on the right hand, where we ordered the gentleman to deliver the key of his trunk that was behind the chaise. There was another person in the chaise, which I found to be his servant; they got out of the chaise, and loosed the trunk from behind, but did not take it down. They unlock'd it, the prisoner dismounted to look into it; and they assured us there was nothing but wearing apparel. The prisoner asked if it was Day's chaise at Hounslow; they said it was. Then he said to the postillion, You are the sauciest fellow that travels this road. The gentleman offer'd us some silver, but that the prisoner refused. The gentleman forced a crown upon him for a bowl of punch for us to drink at night. The prosecutor is the gentleman.</p>

               <p>Q. Look about for the other?</p>
               <p>Darwell. This is the other (pointing to the servant) The gentleman desired he might have his watch and pistols again, he said the watch cost about ten guineas, and he'd pay us the value of it, as we should order. We left him, and went over Walton Bridge; we stop'd at a little house about an hour, and drank. Then we went to the King's Head at Martin, and there staid all night, and lay together in one bed. We got in there after dark. Next morning I met with

I remember there was a very fat man, a blacksmith, there at the time. This was about ten the next morning. We staid there so long, in order to wait for carriages out of town, so to go upon the Croydon road. We went away about eleven o'clock, to a publick house, a little on this side Croydon. The prisoner allowed me three guineas, or three guineas and a half for my share of the watch and pistols, and he took them with him, when he embarked on board a ship for Scotland,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220030"/> about five or six weeks after. We shared the money that we took in the purse. After the prisoner returned, he and I set out in July last, in order to commit some robberies on the Tunbridge road, and I was taken a little beyond Seven Oaks in Kent, on the road, by several people, and the next day I told Mr. Curtice some few circumstances of it.</p>

            . Darwell was in Maidstone-Gaol. I was with Mr. Fielding at Chelmsford, at the last assizes. While we were attending the trial of a man for robbing the mail, there came a letter, giving an account of a robbery committed. After that I heard Darwell was in Maidstone Gaol, where I went to see him, and take his information, concerning what houses Page used on the road; who gave me an account of many. Mr. Barnes took Page about a fortnight after this, at the Golden-Lion, by Grosvenor-Square Gate. There were three pistols loaded about him, two horse pistols and a pocket one. We found also a wig, a cockade, a powder horn full of powder, and about half a dozen balls. ( Note, Page were his own hair.) We took a book from him after we brought him to Mr. Fielding, in which is an account of all the bye roads. He said very little before justice Fielding. (The pistols produced in court.)</p>

               <p>In regard to the charge that Darwell has given against me, I really know nothing of it. I never had any connection with him in any such circumstances. I own I knew him when I was a boy at school, and had some correspondence with him some years ago; but since that I know nothing of him, and why he should place this matter to my account, I don't know. He has had access to my lodgings, and has had a long connection with Mr. Fielding from his own testimony. He is every thing that is bad and infamous, in declaring himself a highwayman. He would have given testimony against any person that he should happen to fix upon, to save his own life. He glories in his wickedness. I am much confused at this time, and can't speak so freely as I would. Under these circumstances I submit it to the gentlemen to consider of it.</p>

            , Esq; I am surveyor of his majesty's woods within the dutchy of Lancaster. About the middle of May I received his majesty's commission to cut down, and sell for his majesty's use, a large quantity of oak timber, and beech, growing on <placeName id="t17580222-29-crimeloc157">Enfield chace</placeName>

I was to pay to his majesty's use four thousand pounds neat, after deduction of charges. During the fall and after, I missed a great quantity of billet wood, so I directed my people to endeavour to detect those that stole it. About the 20th of January I received information that the prisoner at the bar had carried off an oak tree ( part of the fall) in the night. I order'd an agent of mine to go to him, to know if he had done any thing of that kind. The answer brought me was, that he had bought some chips and offal wood of the hewers, but had not carried off any thing else. At the time I received this message back, the witness, who will be next called (

            ) who was said to have help'd him to load this tree, happened to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220031"/> be at my house, and on his confirming it, I had the prisoner taken up, and carried before Mr. Fielding, on the 10th of this instant. Upon his own examination, the witness having sworn to the fact, he said in his defence, that he had bought this tree of one Andrew Tyler, a tenant of Mrs. Sambroke's, who lives about a mile or two from the chace, and that Tyler had help'd him to load it that night, and that he came very honestly by it. This he said was on the 18th of January. I asked him if he would abide by that defence, if he would, I would go over to Tyler, and bring him to town, in order to get him discharged. The prisoner said he would. I went to Tyler, who lives at a place call'd Little Heath, near Northaw Common, and upon telling him all the circumstances I have now mention'd, Mr. Tylor told me he never had any dealings with the prisoner at all, except that the prisoner mended him a plough, for which he had paid him. I then inquired at the turnpike, between Tyler's house and the chace, (where they sit up night and day) thro' which the timber must have past, if the prisoner had had it of him. The turnpike man told me, no timber whatever had gone through that turnpike towards London, for several months. On the prisoner's being re-examin'd before justice Fielding, which I believe was on the 14th of February, he said, he could not persist in his former defence, but that he had taken this tree from the chace by mistake, that he had agreed with me for a little lot of trees, and he thought this had been one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he bought any timber of you?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. He had applied to buy some, but the character of the man being bad I would not sell him any but for ready money. I never sold him any. There were some trees looked out for him, in case he could raise the money, and mark'd with the initial letters of his name. I did imagine that might have been his defence at first, so I took the trouble to go over those trees, and found them all lying on the chace. The tree that he had taken away was no part of that wood. I then took

             to the place, in order to see what tree it was. I found it was an oak tree that had been cut, part of the fall, in the midst of some bushes: the butt end of the tree was left in the ground, and the tree was carried off. I went to the prisoner's house, in order to see it, and found it within his own yard, at Whetstone, where he lives. As all the trees were mark'd with some letter of the alphabet at the bottom, I look'd there, but the bottom of it appeared to me to have been cut off, so that I could not form any judgement of it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that person that assisted him your servant, or any way employed by you?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. He was not my servant; he is a labourer, and was digging a pond at my house, near the chace, and, as I understood, the prisoner got him to assist him. I believe he thought it was the prisoner's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you sold some of these trees to Mr. Sleath?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. No, I had not; Mr. Sleath is my agent, the measurer of the king's timber.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not he measured the prisoner thirty-five small sticks?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. He had measured thirty-five sticks, which the prisoner was to have had upon his paying. for them. Mr. Sleath was the very person that advised me not to let him have it till he paid for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the tree lie open in the prisoner's yard?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. It did.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the fact was it, which you say was on the 18th of January, that you saw it there?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. I believe it was on the 14th of February.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take minutes of his examination?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the justice take it in writing?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. He could not; he is blind.</p>
               <p>Council. Justice ought to be blind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the clerk take it in writing ?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. I believe not; I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner has not an estate of his own?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. I don't know that he has.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon yourself to say that this was the tree that was carried from that place, which you, with Head, went to view; for you seem to say the mark did not appear on it when you saw it, in the prisoner's yard?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. I can't take upon me to swear it is the same that was fell'd there, but I do verily believe it to be the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any means by which you know oak timber growing on the chace, from any other timber growing in any other place?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. The oak timber we sell from the chace is not so well cut; we leave it rougher a good deal, and it was cut when the bark would not run; it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220032"/> will seldom run after the month of May. People that cut down timber chuse to have the bark run, which is very valuable. These particular trees were left with their bark on; it would not run.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear in that manner, in which you describe trees cut from the chace?</p>
               <p>Nuthell. Yes, it did; part of the bark was on it when I saw it in the prisoner's yard. People who can chuse their time of selling, don't cut down oak timber when the bark won't run, because it will pay for the charges of selling.</p>

            . On Wednesday the 18th of January, between eight and nine at night, the prisoner's lad call'd me out of my bed, and desired I would go and help the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner by at the time?</p>
               <p>Head. No. I got up, and went with the lad to the prisoner to Enfield-Chace, where he was with two horses.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you live from the chace ?</p>
               <p>Head. I live within less than half a mile of the place from where the tree lay. The tree seem'd to have been cut down some time before; it lay amongst some bushes, and he could not get it out, so I help'd him out with it. He carried it on a truck with two horses into the high road, and there I left him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say when you went to him?</p>
               <p>Head. He said he had bought the whole hill of timber, and there was never a bit there that would do but that tree.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say of whom he had bought it?</p>
               <p>Head. He did not, neither did I ask him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it lying on the same spot of ground where you shew'd Mr. Nuthell ?</p>
               <p>Head. Yes, on that very place.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Head. It was moon light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you think he was about to steal it?</p>
               <p>Head. I looked upon it to be his own tree, and that he came to fetch it away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more timbers near it?</p>
               <p>Head. There were a great many more.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you, at that time, have distinguished the mark of one tree from another?</p>
               <p>Head. No, but I took particular notice of the place where it lay.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nuthell. The timber on or near that hill I sold for above 500 l.</p>
               <p>Q. from prisoner. How far did this lie from the lot that was mark'd out for me?</p>
               <p>Mr. Nuthell. The witness Head can give no answer to that, but I can; if the court pleases, and if the prisoner thinks it will be of any service to him, I will answer it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you please.</p>
               <p>Mr. Nuthell. The small stuff that was mark'd for him, 27 of them, lay in a plain, at about thirty yards distance, drawn together, in order that he might more commodiously take them away when he had paid for them. This tree was not any part of them, but lay at some distance in the bushes, within the cover.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I bought this lot of timber of Mr. Sleath; it lies on the same plain where I am challenged; but five pieces of them lie in the thicket, and about eleven poll beyond lay this piece in a delve hole. I had two pieces lay in the thicket, about fifty polls below, which was not all drawn together. Mr. Sleath's clerk (named Ellis) measured it to me, and mark'd my own name on it.</p>

            . I have known Whight 8 or 9 years. He applied to me to accept indorsed bills, drawn by Collins, otherwise Wood, that was tried here last December Sessions (See No. 47.) and I did accept bills of my own brother, drawn upon me, and payable to Collins. Sometimes they were made payable to Collins, and sometimes to his friends in the country. Collins at that time lived at Birmingham, and a great many were drawn with fictitious names. There was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220033"/> that lived means to get bills on accepted bills to the value of I at the time that

             told me that they, meaning Collins and himself, had got a new trade, about two years and a half ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what trade it was ?</p>
               <p>Lambley. He said it was clipping 36 s. pieces and moidores. I have been present and seen them both clipping of each. I can't be positive how many time. I have seen them, it may be half a dozen, or half a score times.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain you have seen Whight clip such?</p>
               <p>Lambley. I have. He clip'd them first where they stood a little out, with a pair of taylors shears, then he smooth'd them with a small file; then he made a punch, as he told me, whereby he made a sort of a milling afterwards. I have seen the punch in Token-house-yard, where he lived, and also at Collins's lodgings in Spittle-fields, and I believe I saw it at the garden at Hoxton. There was a smaller house, where were two closets joining to the fire place, and a bench in each closet, for them to work at that sort of work; no doubt but that conveniency was built on purpose for that use. I saw Whight clip some 36 s. pieces there.</p>

               <p>Lambley. I do. I know he was Collins's agent. [He is shew'd six letters. He said five of them were Collins's hand-writing, with Whight's writing on the back of each, and the sixth was the hand-writing of Whight. Most of them were directed to

             were paid by Whight.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this pocket book (he takes it in his hand. )</p>
               <p>Lambley. I believe this is Whight's writing. Here are tools in order to carry on that trade, vices, shears, a pot, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Mr. Freewell. I am a teller at the bank, I know the prisoner's face very well, I have seen him at the bank, and have paid him money for bank notes, but can't recollect the particular species. I had a suspicion of him. The first was Mrs. Wilcox, the second was Wood, otherwise Collins, and the third the prisoner. My suspicion was founded upon a mistake made by Mrs. Wilcox, in the receipt of some ports at the bank. One of my brother tellers had paid her 100 l. instead of 90 l. on inquiring where to find her, he went to the Castle at Moorgate, and was inform'd one Whight would satisfy him about the 10 l. and I think Whight did; and after we had been at Wood's house and garden at Hoxton, I expressed my desire (to Mr. Chamberlayne, solicitor of the Mint) to go in pursuit of Whight. Mr. Kemp, I, and one of Mr. Fielding's men went and took him, at the Castle at Moorgate, on the 6th of October. I ask'd him if he lodged there, he said no, he lodged in Silver-street. We went there with him, and searched, and Mr. Kemp took out of a drawer in his bed chamber a pair of shears, and a file with gold in the teeth of it. I left Mr. Kemp with him, and went down in order to found his landlady. I got from her, that the man and his wife at the Castle at Moorgate were at Whight's lodgings the night before. I desired Mr. Kemp to go and search there, and I took the prisoner to Mr. Fielding in a coach. He was searched, and out of his pocket we took a pocket book, in which was a memorandum, fresh scratched out, it was then not dry, which I suppose he did while I was talking to his landlady. There were nine keys in his pocket (producing them) here is one of them open'd the outward door of the garden at Hoxton, another the outward door of the summer-house, another that open'd both the cupboard doors withinside, and one that open'd the very drawer under the bench upon which they work'd within that closet in a cupboard. I open'd these doors with them, and found in the last mention'd drawer scales and weights, and an iron box, wherein was a small ingot of gold and silings; there was a vice with a bit of leather in it, tinged with gold, in which I believe had been pieces of money, in order to file them. At justice Fielding's we took out of the prisoner's pocket three moidores (producing them) two of them appear to me, and I am certain of it, to be fresh clip'd, and I believe never had been in other hands. I think he is too well acquainted with money to let these pass thro' his hand, any body would see they were fresh filed, and would refuse them; there is not an edge put upon one of them, another of them has an edge put upon it, the other has been fresh filed and edg'd, and I believe will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175802220034"/> pass very well I observed to Mr. Whight the of them, and he desired me not to be too nice.</p>
               <p>M. Kemp. I am porter to his majesty's mint in the Tower. I was at the taking the prisoner up on the 6th of October, at the Castle near Moorgate. I found a three corner'd file with gold on it, two other files, and a pair of shears, stained with gold, a chest of drawers among his cloaths. When he saw me taking them up, he desired me to take no notice of them. We found upon him two moidores, which we found to be weight, they were lying then on the table; he turned to them, and said, if I would accept of that I should be welcome to it, if I would not take notice of the tools; this was in Silver-street. When he was gone to the justice's, I went back to the Castle at Moorgate, and in a de in his room I found some cupings and hg of gold, the clippings seemed to be from 30 s. pieces and guineas, but they were taken away in court after the trial of Wood, and we never heard of them since. I found also a pair of shears, and in a drawer some more tools.</p>

The prisoner sold me gold run into ingots [He reads in a book] Jan. 10, 1757, two ounces, seventeen penny weight, brought by Whight. - April 18, ten ounces, one penny weight, by Whight. - June 22, gold brought, but whether by Mr. Wood or the prisoner, I can't say. - Aug. 5, fourteen ounces, fifteen penny weight, twelve grains, by Whight. - October 4, fourteen ounces, thirteen penny weight, by Whight. I have seen him bring gold in ingots several times.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pacor. I have carried a great many bills to Whight for payment, he paid me very light money in general. I don't know that ever I received any of him but that I was obliged to weigh them. I have rejected both Portugal money and guineas. He would say he had them of a banker, and as he received them he must pass them. I have noted him for paying bad money; his money used to be so exceeding light, I really suspected him in this way.</p>

On the 14th of last month Mr. Barnard told me he had been rob'd, and that Lokin told him, one West, a neighbour of his, had call'd his maid up at two o'clock in the morning. We took West up, and before justice Fielding Lokin at first said, he heard West call the maid up; but the justice hearing the name of Lokin, he charged him with a robbery. Then Lokin said, he could give an account of this if it would save him. Then West was discharged, and Lokin committed privately. After he had given an account, against the prisoner at the bar, at night I took the prisoner, when he came to the prosecutor's house, he having appointed to meet Lokin there. And on the Sunday, in the round house, he confessed to me he did commit the robbery, and that he had broke the buckles and sold them, and had thrown the tea chest into the necessary house. He told me he got in at the window, but did not say any thing about breaking the lock.</p>

The prisoner at the bar came to me on a Sunday in the afternoon, and had a pint of beer; he call'd me to the back door, and said he had a prize, and pull'd out this watch (producing one, which was deposed to by the prosecutor.) He said he found it on Egham causeway. He wanting to borrow a crown upon it, I lent him 3 s. Both he and his brother were inlisted in my house the next morning. Then he came to me and desired I would send him a guinea on it, saying, he was to receive his advance money; and I might do as I pleased with it, so I gave him a guinea.</p>

               <p>I was going to Windsor, and took up that watch upon Egham causeway. When I came to Mr. Pettit's, house, I call'd for a pint of beer, and shew'd it him, and asked him if he would lend me 5 s. upon it. I left word that if any body should come for such a watch to let them have it for the money that I had upon it.</p>

I went there, and found it to be the same. We paid the charges, and had the horse again. The prisoner was in the Poultry Compter.

She asked me if I had any china to mend. I said no. Then she said it was a blessed moment, the first time I ever saw you, will you have your fortune told? I said, I did not want to have it told. She said she could tell me of things that would do me a great deal of good, and also to a person that had been dead a long time, to give that soul rest, and went on with a good deal of this discourse. I said I did not believe what she talk'd of. She said, it is as true as God is in Heaven, telling me of a pot, in which was 200 l. hid by that deceased person. She told me I must go down into the cellar, fetch up a bit of earth, and put it in a handkerchief, which I did. When I came up again she asked me if I had any silver in my pocket. I said, I had. She bid me pull it out, and hold it in my hand with the blessing of God. She said, she did not desire a farthing. I pull'd out a crown piece, and six shillings in silver. She said, I must put it into these things, then pull'd out a bit of earth and some black dust, put it into the handkerchief, and, as I thought, put it into my bosom; but I found afterwards, when I went to look, it was only some halfpence, and a medal piece. (Producing the medal.) She said also that the must have some of my cloaths, or else she could not recover the things, nor give the spirit rest; so I gave her a white apron, a silk handkerchief, a linen one, a cotton one, a colour'd apron, and a cap. She said she would come with them again in the evening. I never saw her afterwards, till last December, when she knock'd at my master's door again (I knew her as soon as I saw her) and ask'd me if I would buy any lace. I said, no; I did not want any. Then she ask'd me if I would have my fortune told. I said, no. She put her hand against the door, and came in; young woman, said she, and began her stuff as before. She said, have you got any halfpence in your pocket? I said, I believed I had got one halfpenny. Said she, will you trust me with it? I said, no. Have you any silver in your pocket said she? I said, I had, and pull'd out half a crown. Said she, hold it in your hand, you must fetch some dust, and I will tell you your fortune. I said, I would not fetch any. She said, then fetch some salt. Then I said, you have rob'd me before, and I will acquaint my master of it before you go out of the house. Then she made a great clamour. Our people came down, secured her, and had her committed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you deliver these things to her that you charge her with?</p>
               <p>M. Beaumont. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never propose to make this matter up with her?</p>
