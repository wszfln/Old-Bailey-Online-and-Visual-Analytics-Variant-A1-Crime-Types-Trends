               <p>What do you know of the prisoner? - I saw him guilty of a very dirty action.</p>
               <p>Begin regularly? - Last Wednesday I was at the Harlequin in Drury-lane, and had a pint of beer; the prisoner came in.</p>
               <p>At what time? - About eight o'clock, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>Did you know him before? - No, only coming up time after time bothering after me; he asked me to drink many a time.</p>
               <p>Then you knew him personally? - Yes.</p>
               <p>He came in about eight o'clock? - Yes; I was in the public tap-room at the Harlequin; he asked me to drink.</p>
               <p>Was there any body there? - Yes, there were people there; but I don't know who they were rightly; I did drink part of a pint of beer with him; then he sent for a quartern of gin; then he asked me if I would go home and eat part of a piece of turkey and a piece of goose he had got; he said, I should be welcome to eat part of it; I went home with him.</p>
               <p>Where? - In Nag's Head-court, Drury-lane; a gentleman that was there, that keeps his carriage sent for a couple of bottles of wine; there were five gentlemen there besides him.</p>
               <p>What all to sup with him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>What is the prisoner? - He washes and irons and cooks, and that for these sodomites; and picks up young fellows for them.</p>
               <p>Is he of no particular trade? - No; after the two bottles of wine were drank out, I went home about my business; they did not act any indecency then with me; the next day they came and enquired after me.</p>

Come to the time that you know any thing against the prisoner? - It was Thursday night that I saw the action; he came after me to my quarters in Exeter-street, he wanted to speak to me; I had not been in above ten minutes before I saw him; he said, a gentleman would be glad to speak to me concerning some business out of the country; accordingly I went along with him to his house; they took me up stairs; there were, I believe, about fourteen of them in all, gentlemen and gentlemen's servants together; by and by there was a rug hung up taken from a bed in the room; there was a fire-place and every thing; the rug was put up in one corner of the room; Brooks, who is a <rs id="t17761204-2-viclabel10" type="occupation">gentleman's servant</rs>

               <p>How do you know that? - I saw it; after they saw that I was for going, and they would not let me; they took the key out of the door.</p>
               <p>Did the rug continue hanging down? - One might see at one corner; and I sat against the fire-place.</p>
               <p>Was the rug quite close to the wainscoat? - No, not one side; there was an opening that one might see; it was hung over a line at one corner of the room.</p>
               <p>COURT. You must be very particular in describing what you saw? - I saw Brooks leaning his head against the wall: they had both their breeches down; he pulled out his - and put it into Brooks's - .</p>
               <p>How long had they been behind this rug before you saw this? - Not above three minutes.</p>
               <p>How long did they continue behind the rug? - Not above ten minutes, as near as I can guess.</p>
               <p>How far was you from them? - Not farther than from that gentleman (about three yards).</p>
               <p>Did you see any thing else? - I saw the nastiness about the room that came out of Burrows.</p>
               <p>Whereabouts in the room? - At the corner where they were, just behind Brooks.</p>
               <p>Afterwards they sat down and began kissing and slavering over me, and wanted to do the same with me; they began kissing me, and used me very ill; a gentleman offered me three guineas if I would go and lie with him at an inn; and afterwards he offered to make it up ten.</p>
               <p>How many were there in the room at this time? - Fourteen.</p>
               <p>Did you sit there all the time? - They would not let me go out; they said, you will be locked out; you had better, said a gentleman,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177612040005"/> lie along with me; after seeing so much clandestineness, I insisted upon going home.</p>
               <p>At what time was this, the day or night? - This was about nine o'clock at night; they kept me till between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Can you positively undertake to swear that this man's - was in Brooks's - ? - Yes, I am positive of it, because Burrows pulled off his coat.</p>
               <p>What became of their shirts? - They tucked them up.</p>
               <p>Where you sat you say you saw them behind the rug, and they were doing this for ten minutes? - In the course of ten minutes from the beginning to the end, as nigh as I could guess.</p>
               <p>Did you sit quietly upon your chair during the time? - Yes; and did not seem to see any thing; that transaction made me sick, I wanted to go, but they took the key out of the door.</p>
               <p>What position were they in to you? - I looked at them side-ways.</p>

            : upon the 22d of October I was going home and met him as I was going along.</p>
               <p>Where did you meet him? - About a hundred yards from the Hound and Hare, a public house on Hanwell-heath.</p>
               <p>What time did you meet him? - I cannot directly say, it was in the afternoon; he asked me to give him some beer, I said I thought I should not, I had not money enough to give him any; however, we went back to the public house and drank together; several people came in and drank with us, being an old neighbour; while we were drinking, I gave him a stick which I had in my hand to walk home with.</p>
               <p>Have you got it here? - Yes; this is the end of it (producing it) which he cut off while I was there, it has a particular mark on it; I gave him the stick this belongs to walk home with, he cut off this piece and threw it down by the fire-side; it lay there some time, and then a young man that was with him took it up in his hand and held it till they went out; he took the piece and Brent took the other part with him.</p>
               <p>Who is that young man? - The other prisoner.</p>
               <p>When did they leave the house? - Between ten and eleven as nigh as possible.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>What is the stick produced for? - Because I gave it him to walk home with, and it seems it was found some where about the house.</p>

             said he saw a man come up the yard; I came to the window, and in a few minutes saw a light and presently the door opened, and I saw Fennelson in his shirt; he looked out at the door as if he looked for some body, then he went in again and came out with a large lump of sugar; Lyons then appeared, and took the sugar and put it in a sack. Fennelson went in, and Lyons took the bag and went off; I gave a sign to the men to go out after him; I went out and saw a man about half way down the passage, close to the wall, endeavouring to conceal himself; I laid hold of him and the bag and brought him into the house, where we found Fennelson; we secured them and sent them to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Whether the employment of a miller in a sugar-house is not a place of the greatest trust? - No; I know no distinction, the servants are all intrusted alike.</p>
               <p>I believe in general, the people employed in sugar-houses are foreigners? - There are foreigners in sugar-houses.</p>

               <p>Whether the majority are not foreigners? - I cannot say, in our house, whether the majority is on the side of the foreigners or not, they are all, I believe, Irishmen and Dutchmen.</p>
               <p>Pray is not the yard from which you saw the sugar conveyed a common yard? - It is a yard that belongs to Mr. Blunt, other people have across to it, there is a way through it; I seized Lyons with the bag and the sugar in his hands; Fennelson put it into the bag, he appeared to let it fall.</p>

               <p>What quantity of sugar was there? - I cannot tell, I did not weigh it; I took it to be about a quarter of a hundred weight.</p>

               <p>There are a greater number of Germans at Mr. Blunt's than of any other nation?  - Yes; the most of us are Germans.</p>
               <p>Are not Germans apt to be very much offended, if any people of another nation are employed? - I never heard of that.</p>
               <p>Is the miller in a sugar-house the head servant, or a common servant? - He has his work by himself; he is to grind the sugar, and when he has done it to help the other servants.</p>
               <p>Is he not much more trusted than the common men ordinarily are? - I cannot say that; I cannot say he is any more trusted than another is.</p>
               <p>Was there ever any quarrel between him and the Germans in the house? - No; I cannot say that there was.</p>

Latham I had often observed at my shop-window, looking under it in an evening; I have taken notice of it to the women who were working in the shop, and when I have gone out of the shop-door, Latham always walked away; I often saw Kelly with Latham; I saw Latham that particular night, but did not see Kelly. Upon the 6th of November they were apprehended; as soon as I challenged some of the things as belonging to me, Latham came up to me, and desired me to be very careful what I swore to, as it might affect his life; I recollected his face instantly, and swore to his being the person I had so often seen about my shop; and said, at the same time, I believed Kelly was the other: upon searching the lodgings the next day, I am not precise as to whose lodgings they were, I understood they lived together, other trinkets and things were found, and particularly, a lock of a little boy's hair I had the misfortune to lose a few days before.</p>

               <p>You are not sure as to the person? - It was the same that robbed me; I saw him stand a good while, and demand Mr. Sawbridge's money, with many oaths; I could hear him perfectly.</p>
               <p>Had he any weapon or pistol? - He had a pistol which he presented to my face, which I suppose he presented to the chaise; I did not see it; I saw my master's hand twice out of the window, and saw him hand something to the man, but I could not see what it was; I saw him take it; and the last thing that he said was, That will do; and wished Mr. Sawbridge a good night.</p>
               <p>Was any body with your master? - There was nobody in the chaise with him.</p>

               <p>How long did he stay with the carriage? - About six minutes, while my lord gave him the watch and the money; when he had got them, he said, Good night, catch me, hang me, and be d - d.</p>
               <p>How far was Gray off at that time? - About ten yards; when he and William came up, I told him I knew the man; that I had seen him at the Assize at Maidstone; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>To GRAY. When he left Mr. Sawbridge what did you hear him say? - I heard him say, He may send after me, and pursue me, and hang me as soon as he pleases, and be d - d.</p>

               <p>What day of the month are you speaking of? - I cannot tell because I did not set it down; it was a Monday; the same day I applied to Mr. Hankins. The prisoner and two more took me down into a cellar, there was a large hole under ground, and they took the glasses and hammer-cloth out; I said I would not buy them unless they told me where they got them; they said of a coachmaker: I told them I had not money enough, but I would take some of the property and go and fetch some money; the prisoner said to me, don't stay long with the money, I have some things in pawn I want to fetch out: I went and delivered the things to a constable, and enquired among the coachmakers till I found where they were taken from.</p>

               <p>COURT. What did he mean by doing of him? - Out of his money I imagine; I told him the man had a note of his for 50 l. said he, if you can tell who that man is I will give him ten guineas for the note, for I know it is good; said he, he comes of age upon the 21st of November, if I could get two more good fellows as well as myself, I should like to stop him and scamp him of his money; we drank a pot of purl: said he, I live at No. 1, in Christopher's-alley, if you can see this man about the note, and bring him to my house, I will give him ten guineas for it; I am sure the note will be paid; we drank the pot of purl, Asher paid for it.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I was along with Mr. Johnson, coming along Chiswell-street I met Asher and another; we went to a public-house and drank a pot of purl together.</p>
               <p>What public-house was it? - The Roebuck I believe; then he talked about this Mr. Lavey who was a stranger to me; he asked him, if he did not know the father and the son; he said he knew both; he said, the son had a deal of money coming to him in a very short time; that he thought him a very foolish fellow and not capable, and did not know what to do with it when he had got it, and that if he could get a couple more men as good as himself he intended to scamp him of it.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Did you know Mr. Asher? - No; he was a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>The Roebuck you say? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Where? - In Chiswell-street.</p>
               <p>What business are you? - A taylor.</p>
               <p>How long have you known Mr. Johnson? - About two months.</p>
               <p>How long is it since you had this conversation with Asher? - About six weeks ago I take it.</p>
               <p>What did you conceive Asher meant when he talked about scamping? - I did not know the proper meaning of it; Mr. Johnson said that was to rob him.</p>
               <p>When did you ask him? - A going along.</p>
               <p>COUNSEL. Then he found it out before he got to his lawyer.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a copperplate-printer in Round-court, St. Martin's-le-grand: upon Saturday the 1th of August the prisoner applied to me for a copperplate to be engraved; he gave me directions how and in what manner I should get it done; most of the directions were in writing; these are the directions set down in his own hand-writing; he said, he wanted a promissory note plate engraved: he first said, he wanted a 10 l. and then he said, he would have a 20 l. expressed; he said, in a black ground, and white letters; he said, he wanted it in a great hurry; this was on Saturday, and he wanted it on Monday; I told him I would get it done as soon as possible; he wanted it on very fine thin paper; he cut the size in paper; as soon as I got it I carried it to Mr. Terry the engraver, and gave him the directions I had received; I gave him the same paper the prisoner gave me; he called upon me again about it several times.</p>
               <p>From the Prisoner. Mr. Long, where do you live? - In Round-court, St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. What county? - The county of Middlesex.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. In the liberty of Westminster? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I did not say, don't offend the imitation of bank notes? - I don't remember that.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you shew me some of Mr. Sayre's bills, and I said I would not have them like that; I would have it in bold German text: was not you yourself taken up on this affair? - Certainly I was.</p>
               <p>GARNETT TERRY sworn.</p>
               <p>I am an engraver in Paternoster-row: Mr. Long came to me to desire me to engrave a plate, he gave me the directions in writing; (the directions and plate were shewn the witness) that is the plate, and those are the directions I received.</p>
               <p>Is that plate engraved for white letters on a black ground? - It will print so.</p>
               <p>You engraved it in Paternoster-row? - Yes, on the 17th of August.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Whether I ever gave you any order? - Never; I never saw you till you was in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If Mr. Long had it executed in any other place, am I answerable for a trespass in the city of London? Mr. Terry had no orders from me; I have been detained four months and never admitted to trial; I have obtained the high favour this day to be tried; I am not guilty now of what is laid to my charge, tho'I have been confined four months; I ordered a black letter in bold German text.</p>
               <p>To TERRY. Was it completed before he was in custody? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have no witnesses, nor Mr. Long<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177612040040"/> had none, there was none by; you have only his ipse dixit for it.</p>
