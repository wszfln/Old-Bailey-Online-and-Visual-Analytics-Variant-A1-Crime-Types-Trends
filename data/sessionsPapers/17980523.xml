               <p>Q. When the watchman took the prisoner, were you sure he was one of the men that robbed you? - A. Yes; he was carried to the watch-house, but was not searched; the next day, before the Magistrate, he was searched, and a knife and sixpence found upon him; the knife was a crooked one.</p>

Then I turned round, and saw a man run across the road, and go into the Leaping-bar public-house; I told the prosecutor he had better go in and see if that was the man; he went into the passage, and he came out, and said, that is the man, I will take my oath to him; the prisoner had not got into the house then, I went in and took him by the collar, and told him he had robbed a man, and he must go with me; he said, no, I have not robbed a man; I said, the prosecutor says you robbed him, and drew a knife upon him; oh, says he, then hang me at once.

               <p>Prisoner's defence.

               <p>Q. (To Ward.) Did you observe whether either of the persons that robbed you had a hat on? - A. The prisoner had no hat.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The prosecutor came to me in Newgate, on Friday, and said, if I would give him a guinea, he would make it up.</p>
               <p>Ward. No, he offered me a guinea, and I said, I could not do it.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Did the prisoner appear to be in liquor at the time of the robbery? - A. He did not.</p>

               <p>Q. What was Murray in Newgate for? - A. For a felony. The prisoner's wife came to my house five or six times, and said she would give me a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask to see the prisoner? - A. No, I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you hear any particular observations made use of to the prisoner? - A. No, not particularly; he said, he would get on as well as he could, and see if he could not carry it to the warehouse.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I never saw him before that day; I saw him in Duke's place, shewing some olives in a bottle as a sample, I think about nine or ten weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you treat with him yourself about the olives? - A. He told me he had fourteen gallons of them; he asked me eighteen-pence a gallon. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230008"/>told him I would go and look at them; he took me to the Magpye, in Aldersgate-street, and I bought them, I gave him a guinea for the half-barrel.</p>
               <p>Q. You took them home? - A. Yes; he put them into a coach, and I went home with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Does he live in that public-house? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more olives there but that half-barrel? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you? - A. A dealer in fish, and damaged pickles.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these damaged pickles? - A. I do not know, I sold them for three shilling and four-pence a gallon; I sold the cask for nine-pence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So, my friend, I make you out to be a pickle - had you any knowledge of the prisoner at all before this transaction? - A. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. And where may you have the happiness to live-in Duke's-place? - A. I sell things there, different sorts of things that I can get a shilling by.</p>
               <p>Q. Honestly if you can - but if not what then? - A. I do not understand olives.</p>
               <p>Q. Duke's-place is pretty much frequented, is it not, by persons of your fraternity? - A. I do not know particularly, I cannot answer that; I have bought them as good for nine-pence a gallon before now, in the wholesale warehouses.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there is nothing to lead you to recollect this circumstance more than any other? - A. I thought I would do the most I could.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect, after the prisoner was apprehended, having any conversation with him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hold out any inducement to him to confess himself guilty, or any threat? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What was communicated to you by the prisoner was communicated by you to the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And was not that taken down in writing? - I cannot say whether it was or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that or not form a part of the examination? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear it did not? - A. It is impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to the conversation you are about to relate, what did you say to the prisoner at the bar? - A. He said he was brought up by one of the people, he did not know what for. I asked the man in the interim, whether he had been for an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner hear that? - A. It is most likely he must.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp contended that desiring an officer to be sent for, ought to be consirued into a threat, and that therefore evidence ought not to be given of what was said by the prisoner after.</p>
               <p>Court. Merely sending for a constable is a regular part of the business, and if that was to be the case, no conversation, after a prosecution was commenced, could be given in evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Was any body present at the time of the conversation but you and the prisoner? - A. Yes, Mr. Prandit, the warehouseman.</p>
               <p>Q. Now relate the conversation? - A. He said, he could not tell what it could be for, unless it was for a half barrel of olives he took from the Custom quay, put into a cart, and then upon his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any other olives upon the Custom-house quay at that time, but your own? - A. No other in the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else to you? - A. He said, when he had it on his back, he attempted to proceed to our warehouse, he was stopped in Thames-street by some carts, and was under the necessity of going up one of the lanes, he thought, Harp-lane, and in coming across one of the cross lanes, he met with an accident, the barrel sell from his back, and being a poor man, and fearful of the damage, he ran away and left it; and he repeated it over several times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of the olives you had lost afterwards? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge whether the prisoner at the bar was employed by you? - A. Not that I know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Has Mr. Johnson any partner? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the prisoner was employed by any body else under you, you cannot tell? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot undertake to swear, of your own knowledge, that you have had any loss? - A. The quantity was landed right with the lighter bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the lighter bill here? - A. No, it is not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. What other warehousemen have you? - A. White and Hull.</p>
               <p>Q. And White is not here? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I live at No. 4, Crown-court: Mr. Freeland lives at the corner next door but one; I saw the prisoner at Mr. Freeland's house the evening before the robbery; and on the Tuesday evening I was going to Mr. Brookes's, in East-Smithfield, for some leather to bind shoes, and I saw the prisoner in East-Smithfield, counting money in the street, a good step from Mr. Freeland's; he had this bundle slung upon his arm; I asked him if he did not lodge at Mr. Freeland's; he said, no, he did not lodge there, but he knew Mr. Freeland very well; I asked him if he would not go with me to Mr. Freeland's, for they had been robbed; I had heard so about half an hour before; I was next to the wall then; and he was next to the pavement; I went to the other side of him; I laid hold of his jacket, and then he pushed me in the side, and run away.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take hold of his jacket? - A. They said it was him that had robbed Mr. Freeland; I called out for assistance, and nobody would assist me, and then a butcher's boy stopped him, but who the boy was I do not know; then I got hold of him, and he went with me to Mr. Freeland's house; then the officer took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. He was strong enough to have pushed you away, was not he? - A. Yes, but he did not do it.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the bundle? - A. He carried it on his arm till he came to the office at Mr. Freeland's house, and then he dropped it at Mr. Freeland's door, outside, the officer took it up; I have had it ever since. (Produces it).</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say how he came by the things? - A. I did not hear him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the men? - A. Yes, one was named Astbury, and the other Martin; they came into the room with a candle, and began to curse the girl that was in bed with me, and one of the men struck her; I got up in the bed and asked what was the matter; upon that,

               <p>Q. Do you know any thing more about the watch? - A. Nothing more than these two women were nearest to it when the light was struck out; I missed it directly.</p>


               <p>Q. What was your watch worth? - A. I gave four pounds ten for it; I have never found my watch since. The next morning I had them taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search their lodgings? - A. No; the officer did that.</p>

               <p>Q. How long has she lived with you? - A. Ever since I have been from sea, except the first week.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man? - A. No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not these men abuse her as you say, and was not the cause of their abusing the woman, because she had gone to live with you a black man, and had deserted one of them? - A. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not state that at the office, to the Magistrate? - A. No, I never knew she kept company with the man in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never said so? - A. No, I never did, because I could not say that that I never saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mason apprehended in her own lodgings the next day? - A. Mr. Brown took her.</p>
               <p>Q. The other prisoner was taken near the Public-Office? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she not there for the purpose of exhibiting a complaint against you for the assault she alledged you had committed against her? - A. I was in at Mr. Staples's office at the time, and I do not know rightly whereabouts they took her.</p>
               <p>Q. you missed your watch at the time the candle was gone out? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave an alarm, and said you had lost your watch? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. After that, the prisoner, Mason, brought a light up, did not she? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Consequently you had an opportunity of examining whether it was gone or not? - A. How could I when I was alone, and all these people beating me.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When the candle was brought up, was the watch there? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. How long have you been from sea? - A. Between eight and nine weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this is an indictment for a burglary, and that there is a reward of forty pounds for each of these women? - A. I do not know what the law is.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear you have never heard there is a reward of forty pounds on conviction for a burglary? - A. Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not sent to the prisoners, and said, that if they would give you six or seven guineas, you would not go on with the prosecution, because you knew they had not taken the watch? - A. No, I never did. Mr. Nixon has been with me, and offered me a great deal of money; I said, I would not, because it is against the King and country to do so; it is in the hands of the law now.</p>

While he was eating, I had occasion to answer the bell several times, nobody but myself being in the kitchen at that time; I did not miss the fork that night, he stopped about an hour. The next morning I missed the fork, I enquired amongst my fellow servants, they did not know any thing about it; the prisoner had told me that he would be the next morning at a public-house, the corner of Quebec-street, to give me more information concerning this situation; missing the fork I went to meet him, but he did not come to the time appointed; I saw no more of him till evening; after dinner I met him in Portland place, I told him we had missed such a thing, and he strongly denied having it; I asked him if he would go with me to the butler, and satisfy him that he had not it; he said he would after he had been to Upper Harley-street; he went there, the person was not at home; then he would not go with me, he said, he had got to go to Upper Grosvenor-street, the person was not at home there; and then he would not go; then we went to Curzon-street, May-fair, and then I got him to go with me; he would not go in then, he said, I might send the butler out to him, for he would not go in; I went, and in the mean time he ran away, and I saw no more of him till the fifth of May, when he was brought to Marlborough-street Office.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM FOX sworn. - I am a dealer in silver: The prisoner came to me on Friday evening, the 4th of May, and asked me if I bought old silver, to which I replied in the affirmative; he then produced some part of a fork; I suspected it was stole; I asked him how he got it; he told me it was his own, that he was a servant out of place, that he had received it of another gentleman's servant to sell; I told him, that was not likely, and begged him to tell me the truth; he said, if I must have the truth, he found it in Wimpole-street; I told him, I did not believe either of his stories. I sent for an officer, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Clarke. I cannot swear positively to the fork, I can produce another like it, they were both made by one maker; I bought a fork in the room of it, which cost me twenty-seven shillings.</p>

I stopped at the Red-cow, a little farther on, where I met with the Bow-street patrol, and I described the tall man to the patrol; I took but little notice of the short one, my attention was fixed on the tall one; upon my description he was taken; I saw the tall man again at Bow-street on the Tuesday following, this was Saturday; he was dressed in a dark coloured coat, I do not know whether it was black or blue, and a black handkerchief round his neck; the moon shone very bright so that I saw his face perfectly distinct, he had a round hat on, not of a very good shape; the prisoner at the bar is the tall man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about his person? - A. Not the least; the moon shone so bright that I could see his face very distinctly; I am sure he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at Bow-street, was he in the same dress that you had seen him before? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there nothing else besides his face, and figure, that you can swear to? - A. Nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of your property? - A. No; he was taken from the description I gave of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a house - are you a master engraver? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him at Bow street who was there first, you or the prisoner? - A. I was there about five or six minutes before the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him was he brought to the bar? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he brought with any body else? - A. Yes, with two others.</p>
               <p>Q. You were there for the purpose of seeing him? - A. Yes; the officer had called upon me in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all brought up in irons? - A. No, none of them.</p>
               <p>Q. But they were brought up as prisoners? - A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand, when they were brought, that you were to select a man out of those three? - A. Yes, if it was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were to look at those three men to see which of them was the man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And did you immediately fix upon the prisoner? - A. I did, in my mind, but I was not asked any questions till they were all examined; as soon as Mr. Bond, as I believe it was, put the question to me, I immediately said the prisoner was one of the two men that stopped me.</p>

               <p>Q. (To Stowe.) Look at that stick? - A. I cannot swear to the stick; it was under the other man's coat that I saw it, it was a short thick stick; I only saw the end of it as he stopped to search me.</p>

             sworn. - I keep the inn, and am book-keeper to Messrs. Whitmarsh and Company: I know no further of the box than has been related to your Lordship; in fact, I never saw the box at all till after this transaction.</p>
               <p>Bishop. This is the same box; when the goods are unloaded from the waggon, they are placed at the warehouse door, and it is my business to call the goods over; I had called them over, and here is my mark that I had put upon it, one shilling carriage; the box had come from Taunton to London.</p>
               <p>Q. What does it contain? - A. It was opened at the Mansion-House; it contains some country pork, a few apples, and a book.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Who is the waggoner of that waggon? - A.

             sworn. - I am a watchman to Messrs. Wood and Company's coal-wharf, at the bottom of Northumberland-street; I have known the prisoner at the bar for several years: On the 11th of May, about five in the afternoon, I saw them shove a peter-boat, which is the property of Griffin; they put this peter-boat out from York-buildings; they shoved the peter-boat to the Black-lion causeway, that goes up to Charles-court, where they both reside; Griffin went up the court, and shortly returned with a basket; they both rowed down the river together. I went over to inform Mr. Butt, the officer, and desired him and Richardson to watch their return; and we went about twelve o'clock, that was the time of the return of the tide; I waited for them till they returned, about one o'clock in the night, as near as I can tell; we all three of us were close upon the stairs, waiting for them; they came to the back of the Black lion public-house, adjoining to the stairs where we were; and they put out some deals from the boat, and then they put their boat back again to the upper side of the causeway, and put this basket, with a chain,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230019"/>out upon the causeway that I was going down; then they put their boat back, and fastened it close to a house built upon a barge; then they returned to the basket, and both stood by it for some little time; then Jones came up to the foot of the stairs apparently to see if the way was clear; I suspected he saw us there; he looked and said, a hoy! a hoy! I then said, lay hold of him, Richardson then laid hold of him; Mr. Butt and I immeditely jumped up and secured Griffin and the basket; immediately as we went down to the basket, Butt said to Griffin, what have you got here; Griffin said, a basket of chains; he asked him where he got it; he said, he got it out of Mr. Bailey's sailing boat, Jones was within hearing at the same time, in custody of Richardson; he said, he was going to carry it ashore for safety; he said, he had the care of Mr. Bailey's boat; we secured them in the watch-house; and the next day, Mr. Bailey came to the watch-house, and asked Griffin what brought him there; Griffin said, it was for a piece of chain that he had found; Mr. Bailey asked him again, how he came by the chain, and he told him that one of their anchors run foul of it; Mr. Bailey said, he had no chains.</p>
               <p>Q. In point of fact, had their boat any anchor? - A. No, nor grapling, nor any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Mr. Hillier, the prosecutor? - A. Yes, I shewed him the chain, it has been in my possession ever since. (Produces the chain.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Hillier. I am sure it is my property.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it? - A. About twenty-five shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Under forty shillings? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>- RICHARDSON sworn. - I was present when the prisoners were detected; I laid hold of one of them, and secured him. The account they gave of it was exactly what the last witness has stated</p>
               <p>Prisoner Jones's defence. We were plied by a West-country barge, to tow her up to Putney, we agreed for five shillings; and then rowed back home. I never saw the basket nor chain either till Mr. Went brought it upon his shoulder, in the basket, to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Griffin's defence. I went with Jones up to Putney; I never saw the basket or the chain either.</p>

As soon as I came out, he begged I would speak to Mr. Wagstaff to forgive him; I told him, I should leave it to Mr. Wagstaff to do as he pleased; I had seen the breeches piece in the shop while he was there. I found upon him the breeches piece and a white marcella waistcoat piece.(

               <p>Q. Had you given her any money? - A. No; I asked her what she would have, and she made a demand of half-a-guinea; after that, I said, it won't do; I went down stairs, and went home, but I was so intoxicated I could not find my way to the house again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, while you were in the room, pull out your money? - A. I did not; I had my hand in my pocket when I paid my reckoning at the public-house door, and the notes were then in my left-hand breeches pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen them? - A. About six o'clock in the evening, in Smithfield; there were two five pound Bank-notes, one two, and one one; I have never seen them again. On the Tuesday after I got information where she lodged, I went to the house, and found her up stairs, in the same apartments; I knew the apartments again, and I knew the prisoner again; I sent for an officer, and she was taken to Hatton-garden.</p>

               <p>Q. How does the sand-bin stand? - A. It is like a bench, and he fell with his left side against it; the prisoner then said, d-n your eyes, you old b-r, I will jump upon your breast-bone; and then we got him into the bar as soon as we could.</p>

             sworn. - I am an apothecary: I was called up about three o'clock on Sunday morning, the 6th of May, to the deceased; I found him lying on his back, in great agony of pain; I examined, and found two of his ribs were broken.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he die of that accident? - A. His breathing was very bad; I bled him, in hopes that might relieve him; in the morning I found it had not relieved him; I suppose, from his age, his lungs were unsound; he had had a cough sometime before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you clear that he died of that accident? - A. I have great reason to suppose he died from that accident.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he then sensible that his last hour was approaching? - A. Yes, very sensible; I asked him how it happened, and he said, the prisoner had got a pint of beer, and had drank part of it, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230023"/>filled his pot out of another man's pot that was standing by his; the deceased said, you have taken another man's beer, that is not your beer; upon that, the deceased went to lay hold of the pot, to fill the other man's pot up again, they spilled part of the beer in the scuffle to get it away, and the prisoner threw the remainder at him, he pushed him over the breast, and he fell upon the sand-bin upon his side, and that he had broke two or three of his ribs, he believed, which will be the occasion of my death, says he, that I shall never be able to come down stairs any more; that is all that I know.</p>

             sworn. - On Wednesday the 25th of April I saw the prisoner and another standing looking in at the shop window of Mrs. Clark for some time; the prisoner then ventured into the passage; the other remained at the shop window; he came out again; he then went into the passage a second time, and unhooked a gown; he looked at two or three, but he took one down which hung upon a nail; he wrapped it up in as small a compass as he could, and put it under his left arm under his coat, and went off with it; I immediately ran out of doors without a hat to pursue him, which I did; I first crossed the way to tell Mrs. Clark of it; I laid hold of him fast by the collar, and brought him back to Mrs. Clark's house, and there I took the gown from him.</p>

               <p>Court. (To Mrs. Clark.) Q. You saw Mr. Ashley come back with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him take the gown from him? - A. Yes; I know it is mine by the print.</p>
               <p>- GIBBONS sworn. - (Produces the gown.) I received it from Mr. Ashley.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Clark. I believe this is the gown; I had hung it in the passage that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it being your gown? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. As I was going along the street, I saw this gown lying at the side of the door, right under the window; I took it, rolled it up, and put it under my coat, and that gentleman came and took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Ashley). Did he pick it up from the ground? - A. He unhooked it from a nail; it was his second attempt.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a very good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure there were two guineas in it after you had said the other guinea down upon the table? - A. Yes; I said to Smith, now I have got you, you have robbed me, and I will have you confined, and then Robinson ran away immediately; I took Smith back to the George, where we had been drinking before, and sent for a constable; the patrol and constable came, their names are Woodley and Evans, I gave them charge of Smith, and he was taken to St. James's watch-house, and the next morning to the Magistrate; I gave a description of the other two, and they have been taken since; I knew them again perfectly well.</p>

After Smith was taken to the watch-house, I went in quest of them, with the countryman, on Tuesday afternoon, to several places, to see if I could find them; I went to several public-houses, but could not find them that day; I could not find them on the Wednesday; the Monday following after that, I saw them both at the watch-house, Woodley, the constable, had got them as his prisoners; I asked him, what have you got these two men for, I wanted them myself; why, says he, for robbing a man of a pocket-book and two five puonds notes; says I, what are you going to do with them; he said, to take them to the Magistrate's; says I, do you think they will go with you quietly alone without their hands being tied; and he said, I believe they are; their hands were tied, and they were taken before Mr. Conant, at Marlborough-street and as soon as the countryman saw them, he said they were the men.</p>

I attend the mails; this countryman came up with the Oxford mail, very much in liquor, on the 21st of April; he was so much in liquor that he fell off the top of the coach; I went and got him a bed at the request of the coachman; he laid a bed till ten o'clock, he got up, and said he was very well, he should have some breakfast; and he wanted to go to different parts of the town, to buy an organ, and I shewed him into Cheapside and Holborn; he could not find one for his price; we came back to th Three Kings, and there was Robinson, and a man they call Fred, and the countryman, all playing at cards, and drinking and tossing; he went away after that, with a strange man, a barber, to see for an organ, for an hour and a quarter; then they agreed to go to the George, in the Haymarket; what I had I paid for myself; the countryman pulled out a guinea, and Fred. the man that is not here, that Wild is here for, went out to get change; I never saw Robinson before in my life; I had seen Fred. twice before; then he said, he would go and look for his guinea, he pulled out his purse, and stood by the door sometime with his purse in his hand; Robinson and he went to see after the guinea, and I followed them behind, I am lame; I heard them talking about his having lsot his purse. Just as we got to the corner of Orange-street, there was a light in a shop window, and there was the purse on the ground, I showed it to him, and then he said, there was a guinea gone out of it, and Robinson ran away, and he took hold of me, and said, he would have me.</p>
               <p>Robinson's defence. I was drinking along with Fred. at the Three Kings. and we were drinking and playing at cards, and tossing, when the countryman and Smith came in; he lost five shillings at cards, and then he took us to the Geroge where we got drinking again; and he took out a guinea to pay for what we had had, and Fred. ran away with it.(One of the Jury said, be was a near neighbour, and that the George was an in famous house)</p>

               <p>Court. Q. How far does she live from Mr. Holcomb's? - A. Not further than that wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did not you take her into custody? - A. I had not such a thought of it; I had no thoughts of law.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go to the Public-office the next day? - A. Yes; when I was fetched.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it since you had seen the prisoner before? - A. I often see her as I pass.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you out so late at night? - A. I was about my own business.</p>
               <p>Q. What business might you have been out upon? - A. My husband is a labouring man, and I had no money till I got his wages, and I went out to market.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever lodged with the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lived upon very good terms? - A. Always; till I gave her warning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it ever happen that she summoned you before a Magistrate? - A. Yes; for three broken panes of glass.</p>
               <p>Q. You had a little dispute about that, I believe? - A. Very little, for I never had much talk with her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she ever summon you for any thing else? - A. Yes, for a stove-brush; but that I knew nothing of.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were very angry with her for that? - A. I had no spite against her.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she ever summoned you for rent? - A. I owed her none.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you lived with her? - A. Thirteen months; I was to pay her twenty pence a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you paid her all that? - A. I sent her the keys and the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that she did not summon you for rent? - A. She did not.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer of Shadwell: I was employed to apprehend Mrs. Glave, at her house in Glasshouse-fields; she absconded; I saw her husband on the Monday, the 23d, I told him it would be as well for her to come up in the morning, the 24th, and he told me that she should; instead of that, Mr. Haines and I, and another officer, got up early in the morning, and waited for the house being open, with a search warrant; that was about seven o'clock; the prisoner was there; and while we were there, the husband came in, I asked him to open a chest that was in the room; I asked him what was in it, he told me there was nothing but feathers; in searching, I found this looking-glass; and here is a sample of the feathers; (producing them); I found two or three duplicates upon her, and two duplicates she threw down upon the floor; I picked them up, and it contains a bed-tick pawned for five shillings, in a different name to that she goes by; she said she bought it of a Jew in Rosemary-lane, she gave six shillings for it; the pawnbroker is here; she told me she had had this glass for a good while.</p>

               <p>Q. How many feathers might there be? - A. They were three or four inches deep.</p>

             sworn. - I know the prisoner at the bar: I live at Mr. Dexter's, a pawnbroker, in Whitechapel-road; she pledged with me a bed-tick for five shillings, on the 23d of April. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that duplicate? - A. That is my writing, I gave it her; she pledged it in the name of Astor.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. That is her maiden name.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Stone.) Can you undertake to swear that that is the tick of a bed that was in Mr. Holcomb's house? - A. I lay upon the bed near three weeks, and I made it every night, and have no doubt but it is the same bed; I have not the least doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the glass? - A. No; I cannot say about the glass.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You are servant to Mr. Holcomb? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were before the Magistrate? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not you examined about the identity of some bed-curtains that were produced? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not undertake to say that these bed-curtains were in the house? - A. I said they were like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say they were the curtains that were in the house, till the person came forward, and proved that they were in his possession? - A. I never said any thing but that they were like them.</p>
               <p>Q. The curtains hung round the bed, and of course, you had a better opportunity of being acquainted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230027"/> with them than you could have of the tick? - A. No, I cannot say that I had; only in regard to the pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. And you made no observation upon the bed, but when you were making it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There are many qualities and sizes of ticking? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not think you are as likely to be mistaken in the one as in the other? - A. I have no doubt it is the same tick.</p>


               <p>The prisoner left her defence to her Counsel.</p>
               <p>One of the Jury. Q. I wish to know by what particular mark you can distinguish that bed-tick from another of the same size and stripe? - A. There is an addition made to it in widening it, and also a very remarkable seam.</p>
               <p>Jury. Nine bed-ticks out of ten are made in the same way; that is not an addition, but the way in which they are usually made.</p>

               <p>Q. You cannot swear positively to them? - A. Yes, I can; by their being my own manufacture, and by the make and shape of them; and there were some pieces that were broke from what was left in the cask, which tallied exactly; the moment I saw it, I said, this comes out of such a cask; we have lost a great deal of late.

             sworn. - On the 17th of this month, Mr. Kent came to the Shadwell-office, and got a warrant; I went to the prisoner's house, and was directed to the upper story, I went up, and there was a woman there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner acknowledge that they were his lodgings? - A. He told me they were; in the afternoon, after he was in custody, in that room, I found this property, this bag was lying in the room, and this pearl-ash, in this cloth, lying on the bag, (produces them); I asked his wife to open a trunk, and she gave me the key out of her pocket, I found nothing else; I took the prisoner in the evening working at a rope-ground, at Stepney; I took him to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Mr. Kent.) Was not he in your service at that time? - A. In the morning he was, but had absented.</p>
               <p>Rogers. The prisoner said, that the former foreman had given him little quantities of pearl-ash for his own use, and he thought he had a right to take them, because the other foreman had given them to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. He said, the apartments you were at were his? - A. Yes; I pointed out the garrets and asked if they were his; and he said, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say whether he had apartments in the house, or that the apartments you were in were his? - A. He said, the garrets, were his; the doors were both open.</p>
               <p>Q. There were other lodgers in the house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He said, he thought he had a right to take some, because the former foreman had permitted it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to him, did you not tell<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230028"/>him it was a trifling thing, and he had better tell the truth? - A. By no means, I would not say such a thing.</p>

             sworn. - I was with Rogers, that is all I know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Silverwood.) Look at these pearl-ashes, can you undertake to swear that those are part of Mr. Kent's property? - A. It is impossible, the air has taken them; I could have sworn to them at the time that they came out of a Russia butt that held about eleven hundred weight.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear that the ashes brought from the prisoner's to Mr. Kent's were his ashes? - A. I have no doubt of it; when I put them together they tallied exactly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kent. The officer was present when they were compared.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Rogers.) Did you see them compared? - A. Yes; Mr. Kent put them together, and they seemed to match exactly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have lived with Mr. Kent about six months; a fellow-servant told me it was very common for the men to have a little pearl-ash for their own use; Mr. Silverwood and I have had words several times; those were not my lodgings that these ashes were found in.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Mr. Kent.) Q. Did you ever give them leave to take any little quantity for their own use? - A. Never in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know if any mark was made upon it? - A. I did not see it made, but Armstrong shewed me the mark upon it, before I went to Mrs. Carlton's; the officer searched me before I went; when I went in Mrs. Carlton was in bed; she asked me how much I wanted, I told her half-a-crown's worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or she say of what? - A. No. She gave me seven pieces, bad shillings, and I gave her the half-crown that Mr. Armstrong gave me; there was another woman in the room, and Mrs. Carlton gave her the half-crown to get her an ounce of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230030"/>tea, and I staid in the house till she came back with the tea; when I came away, I carried the bad money to Mr. Clarke, the officer.</p>
               <p>Q. From what place did she give you this bad money? - A. From a comb-box under the bolster.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see that woman any more that day? - A. Yes, at Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. Were you an acquaintance of the prisoner? - A. No, I never saw her before.</p>
               <p>Q. You know this Court? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You have been here before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You are in the same trade as you were before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were here a Sessions or two ago, were you not? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the Jury would not believe you, and the prisoner was acquitted? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You did it merely to assist the public, in detecting a bad offender? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And that is as true as all the rest you have swore? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What trade do you follow besides that of an informer? - A. I go out a chairing.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not earn any great deal? - A. One shilling a day.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you have given up for the good of the public, six days work-merely for the good of the public? - A. I have sworn the truth.</p>
               <p>Q. The officers searched you, they did not put their hands in your bosom, or any other place that would not have been decent, where you might have had shillings? - A. They could feel whether I had any without putting their hands inside my bosom.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know she was very ill at the time? - A. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What other woman was in the room at the time? - A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was sick in bed? - A. She was in bed.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave the other woman half-a-crown to get some gin to enliven your spirits? - A. No such thing, I gave it to Mrs. Carlton, and she sent out for some tea.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did not you give it her, and desire her to send for some gin? - A. She brought in some gin with the tea.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of seven pieces, you have been in the copper trade, I suppose you know five shilling's worth of halfpence wrapped up are called pieces? - A. No, I do not know that.</p>
               <p>Q. And though you were a stranger to her, she carried on this traffic, and you were also treated with gin into the bargain, besides having seven shillings for half-a-crown? - A. No, she did not treat me with gin.</p>
               <p>Q. You sat down on the beside by the prisoner? - A. Yes, while she gave me the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the officers take the other woman? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. They would not have this woman, though they could, to corroborate your honest story? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say you will swear that you did not take in these seven bad shillings with you, and that this is not a trick to get something for your lost time? - A. I did not.</p>

             sworn. - On Saturday, the 28th of April, I gave Mrs. Mulberry a half-crown piece to purchase some bad money, which half-crown I marked with a pin in the form of an A on the woman side. I pulled Mrs. Mulberry's shoes off, and searched her stockings, her pockets, and her bosom, and she had no money about her; I went to the room, in company with the other officers, where I found Mrs. Carlton and another woman, Mrs. Carlton then was near the side of the bed; on the bolster of that bed stood this little comb-case, which, when I took it, I found eleven counterfeit shillings in it, which are here, (produces them). Mrs. Carlton being taken into custody, I went, with the woman that was in the room with Mrs. Carlton, to Mr. Ward's, and there I saw a half-crown that he had from that woman; I desired him to keep it, I took his address. The prisoner was taken before the Alderman, and committed.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You searched her thoroughly? - A. As far as decency would permit, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that women very commonly carry their money in little bags inside their bosoms? - A. No; I have searched many, and never found such a thing.</p>

               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Do you mean to swear that that is your saw, merely because it is of your sharping - do you sharpen differently from any body else? - A. There is a great deal of difference in sharpening, the same as difference in hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Because it is done in a more bungling way than common, perhaps? - A. I do not know but it is.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I keep the White Horse inn, Cripplegate: The Carlisle waggon came to our inn on the 15th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any waggon and package marked M. No. 77? - A. Yes; I observed that the bale had been cut open on one side.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the bale complete? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did it weight when it arrived? - A. About an hundred and three quarters; I followed the man to Mr. Morson's, and saw the bale counted out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards receive that which was supposed to make up the other quantity? - A. Yes; from the constable, about two in the afternoon of the same day, fifty-five pieces, which made up the quantity corresponding with the waybill.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have these fifty-five pieces been since? - A. They were sealed up by the constable, and have been in my possession ever since, under lock and key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Who was it brought them to the inn? - A. They came in a cart to our inn.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the driver of that cart? - A. I do not know; it was a cart the waggoner was obliged to hire a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. The waggoner, of course, knew him? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore we might have seen him here, if your waggoner had given him information where he was to be had? - A. He is not here.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did he drive this cart with the property? - A. Eighteen or nineteen miles; he took the cart about eleven or twelve o'clock the evening before, and arrived about eight at night.</p>
               <p>Q. But you did not ask the name of the man who actually drove, and have not him here to-day? - A. The carter is that kind of young man, that I do not think he could know any thing about it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. He is not here? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a waggoner: I had the charge of Messrs. Jacksons' waggon, at Fairburn, in Yorkshire.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing any package in your waggon, marked M. No. 77? - A. Perfectly well.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your waggon pretty well loaded? - A. It was over-loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see that package last? - A. I saw it at Hatfield Wood-side, in Hertfordshire, about eighteen miles from London; that was about four in the afternoon; I got two horses of the land lord, and unloaded this package, with others, the waggon being over-loaded, and put them into a cart; the waggon went first, and the cart followed it; we set off from Hatfield Wood-side exactly at twelve o'clock; I went with the waggon and the cart both as far as Potter's-bar, about fourteen miles from London; at Potter's bar I got into the waggon.</p>
               <p>Q. Who took care of the cart? - A. A man that I employ, of the name of Eccles; the cart was drove by a man employed by the landlord to drive the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the packages in the cart secured? - A. Tied round with a rope. When I got within about a quarter of a mile of the high-stone, I heard that there had been a loss; in consequence of that, I got out of the waggon, and went to the cart; I found the rope cut, and the tarpaulin cut; then I examined, and missed a quantity of prints out of the bale.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it out of that bale marked M. No. 77? A. Yes, it was; I immediately got upon my poney, and rode back; when I got a little way, I met a man with a hay-cart; in consequence of what I heard from him, I proceeded down a road called the Chase-road, and saw a fresh track of wheels that had turned down that way, near Galley-corner; I cannot say whether it is in Middlesex or Herts; when I had got about a quarter of a mile down the Chase-road, I met the tall man at the bar (Barnett) in a brown coat, I wished him a good morning, and gave him the time of the morning, and he did me the same; when I got further on, I found another waggon; and, by information, I pursued the track till I got almost to Southgate; at the end of Southgate, there is a little lane upon the right hand, I perceived the fresh track go down that lane; I then rode to Mr. Day's house, about four hundred yards from the lane, and called him up, and told him what I had observed, and then I went and called up Sayer the constable; then we returned to the bye-road, where<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230034"/>I had seen the track go down, and when I got there, we saw a cart and horse stand within the brick fields; in consequence of what the landlord said, I jumped over the paling, and went into the brick fields, I saw Brown, the prisoner, covering some straw upon the property; as soon as he saw me, he made the best of his way to his cart and horse, which stood just by; I went into the shed where the goods laid, I lifted up the straw, and saw the prints lie; I immediately went to Brown, and caught him by the collar; I asked him if he knew what laid under that straw, he said, no, he did not; I told him I would learn him to know before I had done with him. He rather refused to be held by me, and wished I would let him go; I told him I would not, for he had robbed me of my property, and he was my prisoner; this was about four o'clock, as near as I can guess. He said, the cart and horses were his, and insisted upon my letting him take them away; after some little hesitation, he got away, and made his escape; I ran after him, and he jumped over the hedge into the high-road again. I told him he might run as he would, for he was guilty, I had got his horse and cart, and I would have him, let the consequence be what it would. He returned back, and I took him to the horse and cart again, and, with a little conversation, he asked me what I would have to make it up with him; I told him I did not know, if he would go to the public-house, Mr. Day's, I would talk with him about it; he hesitated a minute or two, and looked down the road, and saw the prisoner Barnett coming up, and he shouted to him to come to his assistance; he said, here, here; before he could come up, the constable and a young man came up, then I gave the constable charge of him; before the constable could get hold of him, he ran away again, and we caught him again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear whether Barnett said any thing? - A. He seemed to make a push for it just at the first, but the constable came up, and took charge of Brown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the place where you saw Brown covering over these things with straw? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pieces of cotton did you find there? - A. Fifty-five.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing there besides the pieces of cotton? - A. There was a sack laid by the side of them, and there were the cushions belonging to Brown's cart.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of those pieces of cotton? - A. As soon as the men were in custody, I fetched baskets, and took them to Day's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they such as a man could carry? - A. Not in that situation; a man might carry them if they were done up tight, they took me three turns.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. The first time you had any suspicion that you had lost any property, was near <placeName id="t17980523-41-crimeloc224">Potters-bar</placeName>

               <p>Q. The carter's name you do not know? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw nothing of Brown at all at Potters-bar? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. And how far is Potters'-bar from where you found these things in the brick field? - A. I suppose it may be three miles, or near four.</p>
               <p>Q. And any body might have taken them from Potters-bar, and taken them to Brown, at South-gate? - A. It might be so, but they were very handy if they did.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. After you had got Brown in custody, you saw Barnett coming along the road? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. At some distance? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you say Brown called for assistance, he only called out, here, here? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then hearing the cry of here, here, you thought Barnett quickened his pace? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Barnett in the field with him, or with the goods? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him near the goods till after he was called to by you and Brown? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Knowlys. I live at Southgate, I keep the Crown: I was called up by the last witness, on the 15th of May; in consequence of that, I went with him into a brick-field, about four or five hundred yards above my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the road through which you went leading any where else? - A. Only leading into the same fields beside the brick fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner, Brown? - A. Yes, he was employed in the brick field by a Mr. Kingston, who has a contract for making bricks; I went into the field, and as I was going up the road, I saw the prisoner Brown's cart; and as soon as I got into the field, I saw the prisoner and his cart standing by a kind of shed used for putting in sand; the waggoner went just before me into the shed, and I followed him; as soon as he got in, he lifted up some straw, and there were some pieces of cotton; the waggoner came out, and said, he must take care of him; Brown said, for what; he said, those were his goods that he had lost; Brown said, he knew nothing about the goods; the waggoner endeavoured to lay hold of him, and he ran round the cart two or three times; Brown soon after made a run up the field into the road, and the waggoner after him; I took the waggoner's poney and rode round into the road to meet him, and stopped him; the waggoner then took hold of him, and brought him down towards the cart; Brown asked me, up in the road, if I could lend him 5l.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230035"/>Q. Did Brown explain what he wanted you to lend him five pounds for? - A. No; I told him I I had no money that I could lend; and immediately after came up one of the men, Nicholls, and laid hold of Brown, and took him down to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that that cart and horse was Brown's? - A. It was a cart and horse that Brown has often come to my house in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the place where the pieces of cotton were found? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else there besides the cotton? - A. No, I did not. The cotton was conveyed to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the other prisoner, Barnett? - A. I did not see him till after he was taken by the constable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You say you knew Brown before? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you know that he was concerned in a contract for bricks with Mr. Kingston? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore it was not at all unusual to find him in his brick field? - A. It was a place he had a right to go to.</p>
               <p>Q. And he went backwards and forwards whenever he pleased, in order to inspect the workmen? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you told my learned friend, it was the waggoner that lifted up the straw, and discovered the goods? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you are correct in so stating it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Brown was not covering them up when you came up? - A. No, I was rather behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Brown, when you came up, allow that they might be his goods, but he knew nothing at all about them? - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. It is a pretty large brick field? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About what hour in the morning? - A. About four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. When these goods might be put under the straw I should think you will not swear? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it unusual for Brown to come into the field with a horse and cart? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long a time Brown had to fulfil his contract with Kingston? - A. No.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable at Southgate: I was called upon by the waggoner, Green, about a quarter after four in the morning; I got up and called assistance; I was ordered to take up a man with a pig tail and a brown coat, and a sore hand, if I met such a man; I went up the road, and Mr. Day was coming running for me to make all the haste I could; then I went into the brick field to follow him, there stood Mr. Brown's cart, and Mr. Brown by the side of it; as soon as Mr. Brown saw me coming, and another with me, he took to his heels and ran away as fast as he could, Brown knew me before; then two of my men ran after him over the field, and then he got over into the road, and Mr. Day was there, and they had some consultation together, then my man went up and secured Brown; the other man, Barnett, was just by, walking down the road for Southgate, as unconcerned as could be; then the waggoner bid me take his horse and ride after him to take him; I got on the horse, and took one of my sons with me, I rode part of the way, and got off the horse, and ran after him, and told him he was ordered to come back, he came back with me directly without any interruption; then we had got them both at the Crown door, and they sat down on a bench that was there; then Mr. Brown wanted to get up to speak to Mr. Day, I bid my lad release his collar for him to speak to Mr. Day, and he took to his heels and ran round the corner of Mr. Day's house; and as soon as Brown started to run away, the other started to run the other way; but my brother was coming over the road and picked up a butcher's knife, and he happened to lay hold of Barnett, and brought him back; I sent for a pair of handcuffs and handcuffed them together; I heard Brown say, several times, that he had no money in his pocket, and he dare say Mr. Day would lend him five guineas to give the waggoner; then I took them into the house, and searched Barnett first, I found nothing in his pocket at all; then I searched Brown, and found the tin plate of his cart in his pocket, with his name, and the words "a taxed cart" wrote upon it; then I went to the cart, and there was a brown coat in the cart, and a sack; the seat of the cart was taken out, and was not there at all; the cushions of the cart laid where the property was; then I brought the coat, and neither of them would own it; when I went before the Justice Mr. Brown recollected and said it was his coat.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. How do you know it was half past three? - A. By our own clock in the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Then, if he had gone from Tottenham to Galley-corner, and back again to the brick field, that would have been twelve miles? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Barnett. I had been to St. Alban's to see an aunt, and when I got there I found she was dead; I did not want to stay, I wanted to go to Blackwall; I enquired if there were any coaches going to town, I could not hear of any, and I set off towards Blackwall to go to Southgate, through Highgate and that way, the nighest way to Blackwall; I had every opportunity of getting away, if I had been guilty, when I was called to by the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Green.) You said that Brown shouted to Barnett, which way was Barnett then going? - A. Towards London.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence, as read by Mr. Shelton. I have pleaded not guilty to this indictment, because I look upon it, when a man has once been discharged by the due course of Law, for an offence, he has no right to be apprehended again for it. In the latter end of January last, I was apprehended on suspicion of stealing a watch, and was taken before Serjeant Kirby, Esq. at the Police-office, Queen-square, and ordered for further examination; on Thursday, when I came there, there were all these people against me that are here now; and when I saw that, I told the Magistrate I should wish to speak to him in private; the Justice and I, and one of the officers, went up stairs into a room; I told the Justice if he would admit me an evidence for the Crown, and dismiss the business that I was there for then, together with the affair with which I am charged now, I would make a free confession of a great number of footpad robberies, and burglaries, and tell where they were to be found. Mr. Kirby told me if I really did that, and he should find that the account that I gave of burglaries and robberies done by myself, with two others, in Kent and Surry, was true, I should be admitted an evidence for the Crown. I was committed, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230038"/>the two men were taken, and one was fully committed to the Kingston Assizes for a highway robbery, and another for a burglary, and I was admitted evidence for the Crown; these people now against me were dismissed by Mr. Kirby, who told them I had turned evidence against two other men, upon condition of my being pardoned for this; I was concerned alone in this. I remained in jail till I was taken down to Kingston, I gave evidence against them, I was discharged, and was at home with my friend for three weeks, till having occasion to go to Westminster, the constable came into the room and apprehended me for this robbery; he then told me I must go before a Magistrate, and though it was close to the office at Westminster he would not take me there, because he knew Mr. Kirby could not commit me for it; he took me to Sir

            , of the name of John, brought me a pair of frames of pier glasses, saying they were to be re-gilt, he said he had brought them from Mr. Tunstall; I asked him which Tunstall; and he said, George Tunstall; he said, the frames were to be new gilt, but they were not to be put in hand till his master called; about three hours after the prisoner called respecting these frames, about four o'clock in the afternoon; he said, he had called about gilding these frames; I shewed him the frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they the same frames which the porter had brought? - A. Yes; I told him the frames were hardly worth gilding, because they were old, and the pattern old-fashioned, and he had better<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230039"/>have new frames; he then desired me to go to his house and look at the plates, the plates of glass belonging to the frames, I was to look at the glasses; there was a fault in one of them, from the quicksilver being rubbed off it. I saw the porter again, he took up these plates standing behind some furniture, at the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with them? - A. One plate I received from the prisoner, the other plate he brought himself; I had them both.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you make any alteration in them at all? - A. I put the frames to them, I did nothing to the glasses, they remained just as they were.</p>
               <p>Q. From any thing that you had heard, did you know any thing respecting these frames? A. I suspected the prisoner, and immediately applied to Messrs. Robins, and I was informed that they had lost some property, different glasses, -</p>
               <p>Q. Did you shew them this property? - A. I desired them immediately to go to my house, and I would shew them the glasses I had in my possession.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see Tunstall? - A. I saw Tunstall the same evening, he called at my house, and he asked me about those glasses, the attorney was with him; I told them the circumstance, that Mr. Robins had claimed the glasses.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Tunstall make any reply to you? - A. He said he had bought the glasses in Bedfordbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say of whom he bought them? - A. He did not; he said he would immediately go to Messrs. Robins, from my house, from whom the glasses had been stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you what he would do when he found Messrs. Robins? - A. I cannot recollect any thing that he said particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you you recollect what day of the month it was when you saw the prisoner in company with his attorney? - A. I think it was the Wednesday following the 3d or 4th of January, it was the same day the search-warrant was granted; I think it was either Wednesday or Thursday, but I am sure it was in the middle of the week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the search-warrant executed? - A. Yes; I was in company with Mr. Robins and the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. And for fear you should not know the glasses again, he pointed out the slaws that was in them? - A. He desired me to go to his house to observe this mark, and he desired me to make a new pair of frames for them of the pattern he had seen.</p>
               <p>Q. A report had gone about that some things of Messrs. Robins were stolen two or three days before the search-warrant was executed? - A.

            : It was upon the 20th or 21st of December, I sold the furniture and effects of Mr. Honeywood.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time of the sale, were the goods laid in the indictment, the glasses, and three pair of curtains, in the sale? - A. Yes; the glasses were the property of Mr. Honeymood, the curtains the property of other persons; the curtains were bought by a Mr. Clarkson.</p>
               <p>Had the pier glasses, or curtains, been sold? - A. The curtains had been sold, with other things, to Mr. Clarkson, but the glasses had not. Mr. Clarkson desired me to take care of them, and he would fetch them away when convenient.</p>

               <p>Q. Did Mr. Clarkson pay for them? - A. We did not charge them in his account as they were lost.</p>
               <p>Q. You had been told by Kitely that the things were stolen? - A. I had; when we discovered the property had been lost, I went to Bow-street to take advice what was best to be done.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. When was that? - A. I believe it was on the Friday or Saturday morning. I published a hand-bill, describing the property.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advertise the prisoner, or give any description of him? - A. No, only the property; we did not suspect any particular person at that time. A few days after that, the last witness, Mr. Reeves, called at my house, and described the property he had in his possession; I went to Mr. Reeves's house myself, together with my brother, and he shewed us the glasses; I was very positive to the frames, but the glasses I was not. I enquired of Mr. Reeves who he had received these glasses from; I then went to Bow-street and took out a search-warrant, and we then went to the prisoner's house.</p>
               <p>Q. What happened when you got there - was the prisoner in the way? - A. No, he was not; there was a woman that called herself Mrs. Tunstall;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230040"/> I enquired for Mr. Tunstall, and they told me he was not at home; before I went up stairs, I discovered some dimity upon a bed in the shop, which I immediately suspected to be part of the curtains.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you suspect it? - A. Being the same dimity, and having made the curtains.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the state of curtains, or bed-furniture? - A. It appeared as if intended for bed-furniture, the top part of the curtain had been cut off so as to make valance for a bed. The officer took the property away, it has been in my possession ever since, I cannot tell the exact quantity. I asked Mrs. Tunstall where Mr. Tunstall was; she said, he was not in the way, but he should call upon me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jackson. Q. Did Mr. Tunstall call upon you? - A. I never saw him till I saw him at Bow-street, about the 16th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had left Tunstall's house, and had taken away the dimity furniture, what step did you next take? - A. I waited a day or two before I took any other step, thinking Tunstall would call upon me, according to the promise made by his wife; he not coming forward, I was advised to advertise him, and offer a reward for his apprehension, which accordingly I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that advertisement contain his personal description? - A. It did; we described his person as well as we could. (The advertisement produced.)</p>
               <p>Q. After this advertisement of the 10th of January, what steps did you take? - A. I of course ordered the officer to watch him; I went there repeatedly, and walked up and down before his house, and never could see him; I also made enquiries among the neighbours, but could not gain any intelligence; I continued that vigilance up to the time he was apprehended, which was on the 16th of May.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. I understand the dimity was on a bed in the shop? - A. Yes; and I believe there was a woman at work upon it. (The property produced.)</p>
               <p>Reeves. This is the property I got from the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Mr. Robins. That is my property.</p>
               <p>Kitely. That is the property I missed out of Mr. Honeywood's house.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Robins.) Is that the property you found laying on the bed in the prisoner's shop? - A. It is; it is my property.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. (To Mr. Robins.) I understand, Mr. Robins, that those curtains which you now undertake to swear to be your's, are not in the state they were formerly? - A. They are not; they were festoon curtains.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you undertake to swear that those are your curtains? - A. Yes, I do; I made those curtains originally, they were a drawing-room suit of furniture; the chairs and sopha were sold to a gentleman I know, and I sent and borrowed a cover of the chairs, and it is the same dimity.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, have you any difficulty in knowing that it is your property? - A. Not in the least.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. Q. (To Kitely.) Did you ever see this dimity before? - A. To the best of my knowledge I saw it in window-curtains at Mr. Honeywood's; I really believe it is the same dimity.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Lockhart. Q. Did you carry any pier glasses to Mr. Reeves, the gilder, from the prisoner? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect when that was? - A. I cannot tell the exact day; it was drawing to the latter end of December, it might be about the 27th or 28th; I did not take any notice of the frames.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where your master was about the 12th of January? - A. I saw my master several times in January, at different places, but I don't know where he was upon the 12th; I believe he was in Bishopsgate church-yard the 15th or 16th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing there? - A. I went for the purpose of doing some business about a chest of drawers, which he thought he could fell to a friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he was the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th of January? - A. Several times I saw him in Great Queen-street, Drury-lane; I met him there upon some business.</p>
               <p>Q. From the 12th of January to the latter end of January, did you see him in his own shop? - A. He has let me in on a morning; I have seen him twice in his shop in the middle of the day; soon after one o'clock, he was in the yard, and came out of the yard into the shop; I conducted his business from the 12th of January to the end; he was a good deal in the country, in order to seek after the men from whom he had bought the glasses; he might be gone about eighteen or nineteen days.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, where was he all February? - A. In February I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he live? - A. He lived in Featherstone-street; but he came home, or near home, and sent to me every day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was all the month of February looking after these men he had bought the glasses of? - A. I don't know where he was all the month; the fact was, he was not willing to come forward, till he could find the men, in order to clear himself. I was not with him all the month of March, but I saw him seven or eight times;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179805230041"/>he was at his own house about the 13th or 14th of March, and let me in; it was in the morning, about six o'clock, a little after six; he had not discovered the men at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. In the month of April, did you see him? - A. I saw him every evening in Newton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him in his shop during that month? - A. I saw him one Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw him in the open day? - A. Never, but once or twice.</p>
               <p>Q. His shop is an open shop? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>I believe it is the custom of brokers to walk to and fro before the shop? - A. Some do, and some do not; it is the custom in Castle-street, but my master never did it in his life.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. knowlys. Q I believe, in point of fact, those gentlemen called you forwards as a witness at Bow-street? - A. Yes; and bound me over to attend here as a witness.</p>
               <p>Q. What questions did they ask you there? - A. They asked me of whom my master bought these glasses; I told them he bought them of two men, who came up to the shop, and asked him if he wanted to buy a pair of glasses; they said they came from Bedfordbury; my master told them if they brought the glasses he would look at them, and if he liked them he would buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master agree to buy them? - A. Yes; he gave ten guineas for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell this at Bow-street? - A. Yes, I did; I saw the money paid upon the hob of a stove; I went to Bedfordbury.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you, upon your oath, has not your master taken great pains to discover those persons he bought those glasses of? - A. I am sure he has; he gave me directions to look after these people.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were those glasses exposed in the open shop for sale, before they were sent to Reeves's? - A. They were a day or two in the shop, till I took them to Reeves's.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. Q. Where did the glasses stand? - A. The glasses stood up upon the first pair of stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they stand before or behind any thing? - A. They stood behind a frame, where all the glasses stood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark when he bought the glasses of the two men? - A. No. it was drawing towards dark; I never saw the two men before.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Did your master ask where they had got them from? - A. Yes; they told him they were to be sold for rent for their landlord, and they were at Bedfordbury, the other side of Covent Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the number? - A. No; it is pretty near the Scotch Arms.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go into the house? - A. No, I did not; the men brought the glasses, and my master gave ten guineas for them; I should not have given so much for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at those glasses - upon your oath, did you ever know a broker give ten guineas for such glasses before? - A. If they were as good a pair as these, I have known them sold at a sale to a broker to sell again, and I think he would get a profit upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. How much? - A. According to the customer; we would willingly get a guinea by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you could sell them for eleven guineas? - A. With a little repair. I went to Bedfordbury afterwards, in search of the men, but the house was shut up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever go to Messrs. Robins, and tell them where your master got those glasses? - A. Yes; that very night the search-warrant was granted, I saw Mr. John Robins and his brother at Mr. Reeves's house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lockhart. Q. (To Mr. Robins.) In your opinion, what would a broker give for such a pair of glasses? - A. No broker would give above seven guineas for them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q (To Mr. Robins) Do you mean to say, that glasses of that size have not been sold for twelve guineas? - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that glasses of that size have not been sold for twelve guineas? - A. I mean to swear they never were worth twelve guineas; I don't think they would fetch ten guineas; I should have been very glad to have sold them for eight.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Reeves.) Do you not think they would have sold for twelve guineas? - A. They must have been sold for more than they were worth then.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. In the state they were sent to you by the prisoner, what would you have given for them? - A. I would not have given above six guineas for them.</p>


               <p>Court. Q. What would a broker have given fo them? - A. Six or seven guineas.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his Counsel, and called ten witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know, of your own knowledge, whose house it was? - A. No. I undrest and went to bed with her between eleven and twelve o'clock; I was not in bed above an hour, but I had fell fast asleep; I had two guineas and four half guineas, and I tied it up in my fob pocket. I looked at my money when I undressed; she told me there was no occasion for me to look at my money, for it would be perfectly safe; and then she locked the door. There was a man, who slept in the next room, knocked against the wainscot, and told me, my wife was gone, and to look at my money; I looked for my money, and the fob was cut out of the breeches, and the money gone, and she too; I immediately called the watchman, and he came up with a light, and examined the bed, but could not find any thing; the watchman and I went down stairs in search of the prisoner, and found her next door but one; we searched her, but could not find any other money but what I gave her, that was three shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you sober enough to know that it was the same woman? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose company did you find her? - A. There was a man and some women in the room with her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you know her by? - A. By a stain in her face; I am positive she is the same person.</p>

             sworn. - I am a watchman: About a quarter after eleven, the prisoner and the prosecutor were coming up Field-lane, and he asked me if I would call him up, to go with the Exeter coach; he asked me if I would have any thing to drink, and we went into a house the corner of Chick-lane, and had a glass of rum a piece, then we parted; I saw him go with the prisoner to her lodgings. About twelve, a man called the prisoner down stairs, and she came down stairs almost naked; I said to her, if you are going to have another man, how am I to call that man in the morning; and I desired her to go in doors, and she would not; she went along with the man that called her out to the next door but one; about a quarter of an hour after that, the landlord called to me for a light, and said, there was a man robbed in the house; the prosecutor called to me, and I took him to the next door but one; I searched the bed, but could not find any thing. I then took her into custody, and carried her to the watch-house; the officer of the night searched her, but there was nothing found upon her but three shillings and sixpence.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prosecutor's breeches? - A. Yes; he told me where they were cut.</p>
               <p>Q. Q. Do you know who keeps this house? - A. Yes, Mr. Cook, a shoe-maker.</p>
               <p>Q. What is his Christian name? - A. I believe John, I am not quite sure.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you ever know me charged with any thing of the kind before? - A. Never; she was always very quiet when she walked along the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you sent for a constable, or after? - A. Before; the prisoner, John Wild, said he knew nothing at all of the matter, and went very calm to the public-house, where I found Robinson and the constable; the two prisoners consulted each other, Wild said he was innocent of it, and knew nothing at all of it. Robinson offered me any satisfaction; he said he was going into the cavalry, and was to have thirty guineas bounty, and I should have satisfaction out of that; they were then taken before a Magistrate.</p>

             I never saw before that evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners, are you sure you saw those two men on the night that was mentioned? - A. Yes, I am sure of it; this was on the Friday evening, and on the Saturday evening, I saw both of them in Coventry-street, just upon the spot where I saw Wild the night before Mr. Webley had asked me to go out to see for them.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Webley.) You told me you were knocked down? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had you felt your pocket-book in your pocket? - A. Not five minutes; it was in my inside coat pocket, the right-hand side.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you put the notes into it? - A. The same day I took them in Bond-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in the same pocket with your handkerchief? - A. No, my handkerchief was outside.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you at all tell when the pocket-book and the handkerchief went? - A. I cannot say; I am convinced that it went when I was down, for the prisoner, Robinson, laid upon me some time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was Wild doing at that time? - A. Wild persuaded him not to hurt me, his friend he called me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wild help you up? - A. No, he did not; I turned the other over as soon as I could; I felt myself in danger, and thought I must help myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be? - A. I suppose about three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you perfectly sober? - A. Yes; I knew them again as soon as I saw them.</p>
               <p>Larner. He was very much in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Webley.) You hear what the girl says, were you in liquor? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Have you any reason to suppose the prisoners knew of your having the Bank-notes about you? - A. No; on the contrary I said I had no money.</p>
               <p>Larner. He was in liquor; he said he had no money about him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wild. Did not Webley say he had no money, and offered you his watch to have connections with you? - A. He offered me his watch, but I refused it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Where was that? - A. At the public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he offer you his watch for? - A. To stay out with me all night; but I knew he was a married man, and had a large family, and I was a married woman, and he knew it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that before the two prisoners? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Robinson. Did not Webley tell you he did not miss his pocket-book till he got home? - A. He told me he missed his property when he got home; and that some time before he had the misfortune to think he had lost a note, and some time after he found it in a place where his wife had put it; that she had taken it out of his pocket when he was intoxicated with liquor, and he thought he had lost it by being in bad company.</p>
               <p>Wild's defence. I parted with this man in Sydney's-alley, and then I parted with Robinson; I met the prosecutor again, talking to a woman, I asked him if he was not gone home, he said, no; I said, if he would give me leave, I would see him home, as he was very much intoxicated; we were going through a court I met Robinson, and he run against him, and he fell down, and then he got up, and struck Robinson, and then run away.</p>
               <p>Robinson's defence. The prosecutor was so very much intoxicated, that the landlord of the house would not let him have any more; I happened to meet this gentleman, and I happened to touch him, and he was so very much intoxicated that a very little thing would make him fall; he did fall several times; the next day the woman said that he had been after us; we told her we would go and clear up the point; I went up to see for him; I met with him; he offered to treat me with a pint of beer, and when I went into the house with him, he charged a constable with me; he said if we would give him eight pounds, he would make it up; I told him I was going into the horse cavalry, and I would sooner give him money than he should send me to prison.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Robinson. He wanted eight pounds before I offered him any thing.</p>
               <p>Webley. I did; but it was in order to make him acknowledge the robbery.</p>
