               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186502270004"/>
               <p>B."—there was some discussion—the question was gone into on the summons, and an affidavit read in answer—Mr. Baron Bramwell then ordered the de<lb/>fendant to be sworn, and he was sworn—the clerk who was opposing the summons asked him, showing him this affidavit, whether the contents of that affidavit were true—he said, "Yes"—his Lordship then asked the clerk who was attending the summons if he had anything to say—he said, "No, I have not;—I can't say anything if be still persists in saying that is true"—Mr. Baron Bramwell then said, 'This becomes a very serious matter; just pay attention to me;'and he began to cross-examine the prisoner—he said, 'Where did you serve the defendant? did you serve him personally?"—he said, 'Yes, I did"—he asked him whore—he said, "In the hall"—"At what time?"—'About twenty minutes to 12"—his Lordship then said, 'I can't help it, if he still persists in saying his statement is true; you know what remedy you have got"—his Lordship asked, 'Are you sure you did not give it to a lady,' or "a female?"—he said, 'No,' but I believe after-wards he was going to say that he did—what he did say, was, 'No, I am quite sure; 'he was about to say something else, but his Lordship did not seem to go further into it, and he did not finish the sentence he was about to make.</p>

               <p>(<hi rend="italic">A joint affidavit of Rev.

Mr. Spurrell stated that he was in Mr. Hooper's company during the whole of the day in question, and that no writ was served upon him in his presence.</hi>)</p>

               <p>reside at Oaklands-house, Kingsdown, Kent, about ten miles from Dartford—a gentleman named Spurrell resides in my house—I had accepted a bill for the accommodation of a relation of mine—I remember the 10th October last—I left my house between 9 and 10 that morning, to dine with Mr. Spurrell's father, at Dartford—Mr. Spurrell was with me—we drove there in a light trap—I drove first to Farningham, which is about four and a half miles—I stopped there, and had the horse shod, and called on Dr. Ashurst—that was about a quarter to 11—I was not there five minutes; I merely told him to draw out a bill, which I would pay him on my return—I then drove to Dartford, to Mr. Gibson's—I arrived there at a quarter to 12—I stayed there perhaps five or ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour—I then drove to Mr. Spurrell, senior—Mr. Spurrell, junior, left me at Mr. Gibson's, to send the ostler to take the trap back—I remained at Mr. Spurrell's till 5 o'clock in the evening—I dined there—we dined about half-past 1—I did not leave Mr. Spurrell's premises till 5 o'clock; I might have walked in his garden—Mr. Spurrell, junior, came to his father's house about half an hour after I was there—he dined with us—I did not see Mr. Gibson again that evening; I saw his nephew—I saw Mr. Fooks that afternoon at Mr. Spurrell's—I arrived at home between 8 and 9 that night; young Mr. Spurrell returned with me—during the whole of that day I did not see the prisoner—I never saw him till I saw him at Judge's Chambers; I think, the last day in November—he never placed in my hands that day, or at any other time, the copy of a writ—there is a lady residing in my house named Margaret Godfrey; she is a relation of mine—as I was at supper that night, she handed me a sealed envelope—I do not know what has become of that, envelope—I opened it as I was getting into bed—it contained a copy of a writ in "Eve v. Hooper"—I believe this produced to be the paper—I sent it to my brother next morning—on 23d November, an officer of the Sheriff of Kent came to my house—I paid him a part, and gave security for the rest—I had heard that the matter was settled.—on 10th October, I called at Mr. Ashurst's as I returned in the evening to pay his bill, and his housekeeper handed me this paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—on 28th November, I attended at the Judges' Chambers before Mr. Baron Bramwell—the de<lb/>fendant was not there; at least, I did not see him—the matter was adjourned till 30th November, that he might be present—on 30th November, I again attended before the same Judge—I heard the Judge say it was a serious matter; he cautioned the boy as to what he said, and then asked him if he had seen me, and he swore that he had seen me in my hall at Kingsdown, at twenty or twenty-five minutes to 12 o'clock—the Judge asked him if I was in the room, and he pointed me out.</p>

Q.</hi> Have you any cure? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not at present—the last I had was about four years ago—that was at Kingsdown, where I reside—it was a curacy—the Rev. Samuel Dewey is the incumbent—I gave up the curacy, because he came into residence—the Bishop did not interfere at all; he interfered so far, that he kept me there three years, by arrangement with Mr. Dewey—I was obliged to bring an action against Mr. Dewey, and it was settled, and I remained there three years longer in consequence—the action was for defamation of character, and for an illegal distress—they were both Settled—it was about something I did not like, and which was not true, about a female servant—I had the curacy for three years after that, by the Bishop's sanction—I had a distress made upon me about three years ago—that was not an illegal one—I paid that; there were no others, that I know of; I am quite sure of it; nor any more actions—my brother,</p>

               <p>Charles Hooper, is an attorney in town—there had been other accommo<lb/>dation-bills between my brother and myself before this, some time ago—it was to my brother that I sent this writ—I sent it the next morning, the 11th; I am certain of that; I sent it in a letter—I dare say my brother is here—I have not got the letter that I sent him—I can't say whether he has it; I have not inquired, or told him to try to find it—I did receive the writ on 10th October, but not from this boy—I told the Judge at chambers I had received it from Miss Godfrey; I swear that; I believe I did—I don't know that I said it to the Judge particularly, but I always admitted that I had received it from Miss Godfrey—I can't say that I said it in the presence of the Judge; I can't remember; I certainly never concealed it from any one—when I said in the affidavit that no writ or other process was served on me, I meant personally—I did not tell the Judge that I meant personally; the Judge would not allow me to speak to him; he would hardly hear me open my mouth—I did not know that the Judge would not set aside the order unless I had told him I had not received the writ—my attorney, Mr. Soper, was there with me—I believe he made my affidavit—no, I don't think he did; I think my brother did—he knew that I had received the writ that day; he must have known it, because I wrote to him, and sent it to him—my brother also made an affidavit—I have looked for the envelope in which the writ was inclosed, but I could not find it, and I could not distinguish it if I found it—I suppose it was addressed to me; I don't remember—I looked carefully for it—I don't suppose my cousin has; she would know nothing about it—I can't say when I told Mr. Spurrell that I had been served with the writ; certainly not till after I had been to the Judge's chambers—I don't think I mentioned the subject to a soul in the house—I took two little pigs to Mr. Spurrell's on that day—I gave them to Hilder, the gardener.</p>

I appre<lb/>hend that the judgment so signed, and which is intended to be set aside by Has process, is essential in this case, and should be produced. If there were no such judgment there would be no jurisdiction on the part of the Judge in Chambers—there would be no jurisdiction to issue the summons until there was a, judgment signed, and therefore that judgment ought to be produced.</hi>

'pointing to what was on his head—Hunt replied, 'A cheese"—the constable said, 'Where are you going to take it to?"—Hunt replied, 'To Friar-street, Blackfriars"—the constable said, 'Where did you get it from?"—he said, "From the Underground Railway"—they were both taken into custody—I carried the cheese to Bow-lane Police-station.</p>

               <p>threw himself down in a doorway—I saw Pratt stoop down to raise him up—I stopped the horse and cab and went to his assistance—I then perceived that his coat was saturated with blood, and blood was running down by the side of his face—the prisoner's face was also bloody—I said to Pratt, "Good God where is all that blood from"—he said, "I don't know whether it is from him or from me"—I did not see anything in the prisoner's band at that time, he was so violent—I held him down until after I thought his temper was cooled, I then asked him if he would go to the station quietly, and he said he would go with me, but he would not go with Pratt—I then directed Pratt to take the horse and cab up to the station and I would endeavour to get the prisoner there myself—he went for a few steps with me—at that time Baker, No. 122, came up and caught hold of him on the left side—the prisoner then commenced kicking Baker on the legs—he raised his right hand and I saw that he had this knife in his hand (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), there was blood on the knife—I noticed that at the time—I called Baker's attention to the knife, we took it from him and took him to the station—I then examined Pratt and found he was wounded just above the ear.</p>

I am house-surgeon at Charing Cross Hospital—on the morning of 1st January I was called up to attend to Pratt the constable—I found him suffering from a wound near the right ear, about a quarter of an inch in length, it was a wound that a knife would inflict—I saw the knife at the police-court—there was a good deal of bleeding—he has recovered from that wound—he had an abrasion on one of his legs, the skin was taken off—it afterwards turned out to be a serious wound—he came into the hospital some few days after the injury was inflicted and he has been there since—he is now confined to his bed with that wound—the skin was taken off about the size of a florin—I can't give any opinion how long he will be there, it may be for some long time yet—it came to a very large wound afterwards.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Horseferry<lb/>branch-road—I am in my 82nd year—I am a messenger in the employ of Ricketts, Smith and Co., coal merchants—they have places in the Horseferry-road, in Mile End and in the Commercial-road—on Wednesday evening, 21st December, about six o'clock I was carrying a leather-bag containing 63<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I left Mile End about ten minutes to six to bring the money to the Commercial-road—a lad named Stevens went with me and saw me safe as far as the corner of the Horse<lb/>ferrry-banch-road—I walked as straight as I could come from Mile End to that place—it is about a mile and a quarter I should think—I was in the habit of taking money every evening—I have been accustomed to go the same route at times for the last three or four years—when I got about thirty yards from the Horseferry-road, within twenty yards of the counting-house, I heard some persons behind me—they put something wet over my face, pulled me back, threw me down and then kicked me—the bag was torn from me—I had got my umbrella through the handle of it—they tore that away when I was on the ground, and I saw one of them run across the Commer<lb/>cial-road with it—I called, 'Murder!' and "Stop thief!' and followed him as close as I could—when I got within a few yards of him, he got in amongst a mob of people who were singing—just before he got on to the kerb I was within ten yards of him—the string of the bag hung at his leg and I caught his side face, and I believe it to be the prisoner Coster—I am quite certain of it—I had known him before—he has worked for the firm as coal-porter—I have no doubt at all about his being the man—I saw the girl Smith standing amongst the people and 1 asked her which way the man went with the leather-bag—she said, "That way"—pointing in the contrary way to which the man ran—I do not recognise either of the other prisoners—there</p>

               <p>were certainly two men attacked me—one held me and put the treacle on my face and the other pulled the bag from me—I saw nothing more of the bag that night.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What was this substance that was put on your face? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rag and treacle—it was put right over my eyes—I was walking on the pavement close to the fence—I did not hear them coming behind, being a little deaf—the treacle was damp—I suppose I wiped my eyes when I got up—I did not stop to use a pocket-handkerchief—I could see my way across the road—I saw the man going across the road quite plain—I fetch the money every night from one office to the other—the amount varied—I have known Coster a twelvemonth perhaps—the bag was heavy, there were 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of copper tied up in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packets, and about 58<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—the string that was tied to the bag hung at the man's legs, and he could not run very fast—I lost him in the crowd—I know which way he went, because afterwards I turned round and saw two people running up the road—I gave information to the police that very night—I did not say anything about Coster that night—I said I had been robbed and they sent a private policeman home with me—I did not say a word about Coster being the man at the station, but when the policeman came home with me I did—I told my wife and she told him—my wife is not here—I did not say anything at the station about suspecting Coster—I did not wish to tell anybody, in the presence of a lot of people, because it would prevent his being taken—I thought we should find him the next morning—I was excited and very angry at being knocked down—I and the policeman went down the York-road together to see if we could find any one—the policeman asked me if I could form an idea of the man, and I said to my wife, "Mother, I think it is that <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> who stood about here lame"—I told the policeman who Coster was—I did not know anybody else—I might have said when I was first examined that I was not quite certain about Coster—I am quite certain about him now—the reason I have not mentioned it so many times is because I have always been afraid of being knocked about by the other coal-porters, his friends.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a letter-carrier at Harrow—the prisoner was the principal letter-carrier there—I remember the mid-day mail arriving on 16th January, soon after two—the prisoner was absent that day and I had to take his duty—this letter was sorted to me—I was a Stranger on the prisoner's walk—I took the letter out for delivery, but could not find the person—I took it back to the office and gave it to the next man who was going out oil that delivery, I think it was Blake, to take it out on trial, as we did not know where to deliver it—the letter was then perfectly safe, fastened up.</p>

I am a letter-carrier at Harrow—I remember Wise giving me a letter on 16th or 17th January—I think this is the letter, but 1 could not say—I never took it out"; if we have a difficulty in finding the person to whom a letter is addressed, it is taken back to the office and placed in the hands of the charge-taker the head letter-carrier, that was the pri<lb/>soner; whatever he thinks proper is done with it—if it cannot be delivered the last that had it out writes upon it and hands it to the charge-taker, and it is sent back to the dead-office; that is what I have always understood—I did not give it to the prisoner.</p>

I am a dairyman, of 13, Regent-streel, Limehouse-causeway—on the evening of 3d February I went to bed about ten o'clock—the house was safe as usual—I did not myself see that the windows were down; I should have noticed if they had been open—there was no fastening to the windows; they were merely shut down—about eleven o'clock I was disturbed by the girl screaming out that there was some one in the house—I directly jumped out of bed and began to dress Myself and got a light, and presently the prisoner spoke and said, "All right, Mr. Sharpley, it is only me, I will explain it, have merely got in for a night's lodging"—I did not know him, it appears that he knew me: I know some member of his family—I opened my bedroom door and he was there—he had come down stairs—he began to explain himself—he said he thought it was an empty house, and he had got in at the staircase-window for the purpose of a night's lodging—he said he had shut the window after him, and it was shut—I found no property disturbed—the prisoner was quite sober—I did not notice whether the staircase-window was shut when I went to bed, it is a sash-window—the servant is not here.</p>

About half-past 1 o'clock on the morning of 19th January, I was on duty in the Bethnal-green-road, and met the three prisoners at the corner of White-street—I requested them to move on, not liking their appearance—Dougall said, 'I am going, 'and went on—from the way the others moved I suspected something—there was some ground glass on one side, and clear glass on the other, where a fire-engine is kept, and the lamp shone through the clear glass right on their faces—I went down White-street, and when at the corner of Sale-street, I saw them walk back across the road—I went into Abbey-street, took off my light, and saw the two women standing side by side against the door of Mr. Hall, the jeweller, 63, Bethnal-green-road—I ran, and when within a few yards of them, one of the women said, <hi rend="italic">"Blind me here is a slop"</hi> which is a nick-name for a policeman—I could not see the man, but he jumped up and ran across the road—I could not then say that he was the same man as I had seen before, but after he moved I could see that his dress was the same as that of the man I had spoken to before, but I could not see his face—I took the two women in custody, and sprang my rattle, but it broke—this was on the morning of Friday the 20th—I saw the man again on the Wednesday following at Worship-street in a room with several other prisoners, and inquired who had him in custody—when I had taken the women to the station I called the prosecutor up, and examined the house door—I found seven dents just by the lock, which seemed to have been made by an in<lb/>strument which my brother constable found—we had heard something drop—(<hi rend="italic">An iron holdfast produced</hi>)—I have compared this with the marks, and found they fit exactly.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Benjamin Wybrow, a chair-maker, of 8, Kingsland-road—on the night of the 3rd of February, about a quarter-past 8, as near as I can remember, the two prisoners came into our shop together—they stood side by side—Wright asked to look at some chairs—I showed them to him as they stood—he would not let me move away—he looked at those that stood in front of him—I was from five to seven minutes showing them the chairs—I had a reasonable opportunity of looking at the men—I always look at people when I am serving them—after Wright had examined the chairs, Levi held one up in his hand—Wright said to me, "Have you any cheaper"—I said "Oh, yes"—I was going to get the cheaper pattern and he said, 'Oh, no, there is no occasion for that, we will send a young woman to-morrow to look at them and buy for her<lb/>self—then Levi said, "Yes, we will send a young woman to-morrow to look and buy for herself"—they then moved to go away—I felt in my pocket and found my purse was gone—I had felt it safe in my pocket just as they</p>

               <p>were coming in at the door; I was then placing it in my pocket—when I found my purse was gone, Levi had got down the two steps from the shop, but Wright had scarcely got down when I missed it—I instantly exclaimed, "You rascal, you have got my purse"—I seized Wright by the coat just as he got down the steps, but he was too strong for me and got away—they both ran up the Kingsland-road—Wright turned towards Hackney-road, and Levi crossed the road to a cab-stand into Shoreditch—my husband was in the back part of the shop at the time they were there, and my two daughters were looking at them through the parlour door; I saw them there—I saw Wright again about five minutes after, when he was in custody—I preferred the charge against Wright at the station-house, and was returning towards my own home and met Levi just this side of the station-house, not far from it—he then had another coat on over the one he had on when he was in my shop—my daughter was with me—I got in front of Levi, and said to her, "That is the other man"—I looked him well over to make myself certain he was the man—I noticed his general appearance, and I was confident he was the man, and then a constable came and took him into custody—I had never any doubt about his being the man from the first moment I saw him, and I knew his voice—I heard him speak in the shop, and when he spoke in the station-house that quite confirmed me.</p>

I am the husband of the last witness—on the night of 3rd February, about a quarter or twenty minutes past eight I came into my shop, when two men were there—I had an opportunity of observing those two men—the prisoners are the men—they were looking at some chairs my wife was showing them—I remained in the shop some time, and I went down stairs again—soon after I heard my wife call out, "They have robbed me, they have stolen my purse"—I instantly came up stairs and pursued, but did not see them then—I afterwards saw Wright, about 100 yards from my shop—my daughter Elizabeth had hold of him—I seized him by the coat-collar and said, 'You rascal, you have robbed my wife of her purse"—he said, 'Now, governor, hear me, I know where the purse is, and if you will come with me I will get it for you"—I said, 'I won't do so,' and called "Police" as loud as I could—a man had got hold of him then—he was surrounded by a mob—I caught hold of him, and he became very restive—he asked me once or twice to let him go, and I would not, and some one called out, "Slip your coat, slip your coat"—I found then we were surrounded by a great many persons of this kind—in trying to slip his coat it came open—I still held on fast, and the coat tore in my hands—it was torn almost to ribbons in trying to get it off—I then seized him by the back of the cravat, that gave way and I lost my hold again—I then seized him by the neck, and he got ray finger in his mouth, bit it right across, and made a large wound—I still struggled with him—I should think it was five or six minutes before a policeman came—some people in the mob pulled me by the legs away from Wright—the policeman came up and I said, "There he is, there he is, take him quick or else he will escape, 'and be took him—I have not the slightest doubt about the prisoners being the persons who came into the shop.</p>

We changed the note and divided the money. We parted there, as I had some friends living in London. I went to Dept-ford and Greenwich, went into a shop for some cough-drops, and tendered this shilling. I did not know it was bad till the woman said so. I gave her another. I put it into my pocket, intending to destroy it I then went to get some tobacco, and was given in charge. This man is an entire stranger to me, and all that he has been saying about me is false.</p>

I live at 12, St. George's-road, Commercial-road, Peck<lb/>ham, and am a tailor's foreman—my house is in the parish of St. Giles, Camberwell—on the evening of 9th January, I went to bed at quarter-past 12 o'clock; the house was then secure—the front parlour-door was fastened by a catch—I was called up from 2 o'clock to a quarter-past and on coming down found that the house had been entered by the parlour window—I missed two coats, a pair of sugar-tongs, two spoons, and a bird from a cage—this coat (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) belongs to my boy; he was wearing it the day pre<lb/>viously—it is my own manufacture, and I know it well—the value of the property I lost is between 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

Do not take that; for I bought it, and paid for it"—the female prisoner said, "Yes, that is my little boy's coat. I bought it, and paid for it, and can show the receipt"—I examined the prosecutor's house, and found that some sharp instruments had been put between the sashes, and the catch had been forced back—I found this knife in the younger male prisoner's pocket, which the elder said was his; it has "J. J. W." on the handle—here are some notches in it—a knife like this, if used between the sashes of the window, would open the catch—the mark on the sash was just about the width of this knife.</p>
