On Sunday night, the 26th of October, I went out about ten o'clock, returned in forty minutes, and about twelve missed these two great coats out of the surgery; I had seen them safe at nine o'clock. The persons had got over the wall, unbolted the gate, and forced open the door of the surgery, which is part of the house; they had forced the spring of the lock back - it is a common spring lock, and goes very hard; I am sure it was fastened, but it had not been locked inside - it was not double locked, but I am sure the bolt had caught; it could not be pushed open. I saw my coats again on the Tuesday, cut up - (looks at them;) I know them well, they are both mine; I have had them about a year and a half; one cost four guineas, and the other five. Compton had been in my service, and was discharged on the Saturday night previous, for being drunk - he drove me. Denton lives at Southgate.</p>

            . I live at Southgate. I stopped at the Thatched House with Burgess, on Monday morning, about eleven o'clock - the prisoners came up in a cart together, and stopped to give the horse some hay - I believe it was Denton's cart; he called for a pint of beer. An old clothes man came by; Compton said to Denton, "Go and sell him those two coats;" Denton called the man to him, and pulled the coats out of the cart; they were like those produced. He asked 2 l. for them - the man did not buy them; they were put into the cart again. Compton was a very little way from the Jew. Denton came to me and said, "If you hear any alarm about those coats, don't take any notice about it, the coats belong to Dr. Hammond." Compton could hear what he said. I was getting my horse ready, another clothes man came by - Denton offered them to him in Compton's presence, and after that he offered them to the pot-boy of the Thatched House; he tried one on, but did not buy it. I went away, and they drove off before me, towards Southgate. Denton knew me before very well.</p>

            . I am a horse-patrol of Bow-street. On the 31st of October, Clarkson called on me to assist in taking the prisoners before the Magistrate. While he went with Denton for the coats, Compton was in my custody - I neither threatened or promised him; he said, "Where is Denton gone?" I said to fetch the coats - he said, "If Denton is admitted to see the Magistrate, I hope I shall, I have something to state, and will state it to you" - he said that on the morning of the 26th of October, he was in company with Denton, and again in the latter part of the day, and they agreed to go together to Dr. Hammond's to take his fowls - they waited at Denton's house till between ten and eleven o'clock, when a stranger to him came in and agreed with Denton to go with them, and between eleven and twelve o'clock all three proceeded to Dr. Hammond's house. Compton knowing the premises, he got over the wall, unfastened the gate, and let in the stranger. Denton remained at the gate to look out; they proceeded to the fowl-house. Compton broke open the out-house where the fowls are kept, and gave them to the stranger, who wrung their necks, and put them into a sack; they then came to the surgery, got in there, and took two coats - that he got the door open; he did not say whether by force or not, and as they came out of the gate, Denton said, "Here comes the patrol," and they waited on the premises till he had passed, and then proceeded. Denton left the gate, and they got to his house with the fowls and coats, and found him at home; they then agreed to go to the Cherry-tree, which they did, and stole some fowls, carried them to Denton's, killed them there, and took them to market next morning, but Compton said he never received any benefit from them.

            . I am a patrol, and was present when Compton made this statement - it was quite voluntarily.</p>
               <p>MR. HAMMOND. My fowl-house was broken open that night, and ten fowls and a cock stolen - the neck of one was left behind, and there were marks of blood about, as if they had been killed. Compton had lived six weeks with me, and often took these coats into the surgery. The lock was broken off the fowl-house door, and the stable lock thrown into the path; the fowl-house is at the back of the stable. The coats cost nine guineas together, and had not been much worn; they are worth two guineas each - it is a spring lock, and will not keep open, it opens by a handle outside. We found it shut after the robbery.</p>
               <p>COMPTON'S Defence. The fowls are kept in an open shed; it is not locked up.</p>
               <p>DENTON'S Defence. On Sunday morning Compton came to me, and asked me to give him a ride to town - I said as he was out of place I would; he asked what time I should start in the morning; I said about half-past four or five o'clock - he asked if he might sit up in my house all night, till I started, which I agreed to. I had lent my cart, and as it was not brought home, at twelve o'clock, I went as far as my brother's stable to see if I could see the man coming with it. I was not nearer to the prosecutor stable than that, and at that time the young man came into my place, and in the morning I went to fetch my cart, and during that time the bundle Compton had was put into one of my flats, and afterwards put into my cart by Compton. I knew nothing of it till we got to the Four Swans, Bishopsgate, where Compton took his bundle and bag out, and went away with a friend of his, (who we met there,) and agreed to meet me at the Angel, public-house, Islington, at half-past ten o'clock - he came about eleven with one of the bundles, which he had taken out of the cart, and offered the two coats for sale there. I did not know who they belonged to till we got to the Thatched House. A Jew went by; he told me to offer them for sale to him, which I did before these two men, who I knew well. He saw me talking to Hale, and asked if I knew him; I said Yes, and then he told me whose the coats were, and I told Hale, fearing I should get into a mess about it; we drove on. He took his coats out, and left me.</p>

On the 21st of March, about a quarter to nine o'clock in the evening, I went up to my drawing-room - this clock then stood on a slab on the stair-case, and was not fixed. It was about twenty feet from the door, which was fastened, for I tried the door as I came out of the parlour, having lost two great coats from the passage shortly before. It has a spring lock, and cannot be opened outside but by force. I was alarmed soon after, and the clock was gone - I went and found the door ajar. I bought the clock of Captain Hall's executors, with the lease of the premises, three years ago, and gave ten guineas for it. Since it was stolen the maker's name has been erased, and a new top put on, and new handles; but I know it by the minute hand, which I had bent, and tried to straighten myself. I missed it on the 21st of March, and found it on the 15th of October.</p>

The handles are now altered, and Pettigrell and Duterell our names are erased, and that of Grant inserted; I can see where it has been scratched out, and the handles are new.

On the Saturday week, before the 1st of July, he came to me, and said his things were going to be seized for rent, and asked if I would buy a clock, and knowing him so long, I said he might bring it on trial for a week, which he did in about ten minutes - the price was 7 l. 17 s., and on the 1st of July, he called; I said I would keep it, and paid him - he gave me a receipt - he said he bought it at Robinson's rooms, of a young man who was going from town.</p>

On the 10th of November, a little after eight o'clock in the morning, I was coming down the lane opposite the warehouse, and saw him come out of the door with a bag on his shoulder, and throw it into a light cart which stood at the door; it immediately drove away, rather quick. I could not see the driver for the angle of the lane. I went and told my father, who is also in Mr. Taylor's employ. Mr. Taylor was informed of it when he came to town; the prisoner was called into the counting-house, and Mr. Taylor charged him with it - he strongly denied it two or three times, but afterwards said it was true, and that one Jones, who was at the door knew all about it - Jones was once in our employ; he would not tell us who drove the cart.

            . I am a constable. On the 5th of November, between one and two o'clock I was in St. Martin's-le-Grand, and at the corner observed the prisoner and two others lifting this package on a post; the prisoner took it on his back, and went a few yards down St. Martin's-le-Grand. I went up and said, "You have got a very heavy load, what does it contain?" (the others had gone down Newgate-street) - he said he did not know; I asked if he had a bill of parcels; he said No, that he was going to Gray's Inn-lane with it, and brought it from Mr. Cowley's in Lombard-street - I said if he was a regular porter he would have a knot; he said he would go with me to where he brought it from. I found the direction was covered with mud, but could see the name Dudley, London. I left it in a shop, and took him to the prosecutor's, which is about twenty-eight yards from the spot - he then said he had done it from distress.</p>

I went home, and told my father, and then came to Smithfield - I got to Smithfield on the 7th, about two o'clock in the afternoon, and found her in the market, with a bridle on; the saddle was left in the stable. A chimney sweeper was in possession of the mare; it is worth 17 l. I got an officer - the prisoner came out of a public-house, and the officer took him. I had seen him at Burnham the day before; he examined the mare's mouth as she stood in the stable. He asked where the mare came from I think, but am sure he said something about her. I am certain of him.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 7th of November, about three o'clock in the afternoon. I saw Dancer in Smithfield - he pointed the mare out; a chimney sweeper had possession of her. I went up and stopped him - he said it belonged to a person in the public-house. I sent Harker to the public-house with him while I held the mare - the prisoner was brought out, and caught hold of the mare, and said, "This is my property, take it from me who dare." I secured him. Dancer swore positively to it - the prisoner said something about it. I searched him, and found a spur in his pocket.</p>

I rode it up and down; Turnpenny came and asked how I came by it - I told him who gave me leave to ride it, and went with Harker to the public-house; the prisoner was brought out - he put his hand on the mare, and said it was his property.

I was to have met Gamble and her friend there at six o'clock - she is a woman of pleasure. I had a glass of grog at one o'clock. Bluegate-fields is about three-quarters of a mile from the house. I felt the watch go, saw it in his hand, and made a grasp at it. I was rather intoxicated.</p>

             that night, at ten o'clock, at the Standard - I went there with a female; I had promised to meet him there at six o'clock. We stopped there about half an hour, and had a pint of beer, which I paid for. I saw the prisoner there; I did not know him before - he was in company with four more. I could not get Newton away, and I went and spoke to the watchman to help me out of the house with him - he was not much in liquor, but the prisoner and his companions wanted him to stop there with them. I went to sit down by him, and they shoved me out of the seat, and said I did not belong to him, and they would not let him go. When I got the watchman, he came away with me - the prisoner and two more helped him out of the door. Newton, I, and the young woman went away together, and they all five followed us, and one of them said if I did not let the man go, he would knock me down. When we got to my door, the prisoner shoved Newton back against the wall, and took the watch out of his pocket with his right hand, and as he was getting it out he put his thumb up to my throat, and almost throttled me. He gave the watch to one of his companions, and then ran away - I ran after them, calling Stop thief! Newton also ran. The prisoner was stopped, but he got out of my sight for a short time; I am sure he is the man who took the watch. I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you quite sure you never saw him before - A. Never. I was never at the Standard but once before. My friend is an unfortunate woman, and lived in the same house, but not in the same room. The prosecutor was a little in liquor, but not much; he was not tipsy. The prisoner pushed him in the breast with his left hand, and took the watch with the right, and at that time put his left hand to my throat; there is a gaslight at the door. I am certain of his person. Newton took his watch out at the public-house to see the time, and I saw his seal hanging out in the street; it is a silver<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030009"/>watch - I had often seen it - he had two seals and a key. Betsey Harris is the female who was with me; she was not bound over to attend here - she went before the Magistrate, but was not called. She went home last Monday to her mother's, who is very ill. Newton set up in my room all night, and did not go to bed.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 17th of November, I was stationed in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell, and about the middle of New Gravel-lane, I heard the rattle spring, between eleven and twelve o'clock - I listened, heard it a second and third time, and heard a call of Stop thief! it came down the lane from towards me. I stopped under the gas lamp, and saw five men running towards my beat; I stepped into the middle of the road, and drew my stick ready to receive them - three ran on the left side, and two on the right; I collared the first who came up - he said, "I have not done it, that is the one who has done it," pointing to the prisoner. I directly let go of him, and laid hold of the prisoner, but still called Stop thief! after the others. The prisoner said, "I have not done it, the man you have let go has done it;" I said, "Somebody has done it, and I shall secure you right or wrong." The first person who came up was Gamble, the witness - she said, "Watchman, what have you got him?" I said, "Is this the man;" she said, "Yes, that is the man who robbed him, I will swear." The prisoner did not say a word. I searched him, but found nothing. Newton came up next, and said he was the man who had stolen his watch, and gave him in charge. The prisoner seemed out of breath.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You saw five persons in the road, at that time you saw none in pursuit - A. No; none of them were in sight at the time. Newton appeared tipsy, but I cannot say, for I was so flurried, having so many round me, but he appeared very intoxicated.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after you stopped the prisoner did Gamble come up - A. About two minutes. I stopped him six or seven hundred yards from Bluegate-fields. I did not know the charge against him till Newton came up.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am wholly innocent.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Honeysuckle-court, Moor-lane, Fore-street, and am foreman to Mr. White, horse-slaughterer, of Sharp's-alley, Cow-cross. On Tuesday, the 4th of November, about four o'clock in the afternoon, the prisoner came to me there with several other boys; he had a poney, and asked if I would buy it; I said, Yes, and asked what he wanted for it - he said 15 s. I said I should give but 12 s., as it was so small; he said that was too little, but he supposed I must have it. I questioned him where he came from, and who he was - he gave me a name, which I do not recollect, but it was not Fairchild - he said it was his father's horse; I asked where his father lived; he said, "In Middle-street, Cloth-fair." I asked why his father wanted it killed - he said it was a very old horse, his father had had it ten years, and had no further occasion for it. I said we were very particular in buying horses, and should like to see his father, and would go to him with him, which he consented to very readily. I set off with him, leaving the horse in our slaughter-house, and when I came to Middle-street, the landlady came to the door of the house he said he lived in - I asked if she knew anything of him; she said No - he was present with the other boys. I then suspected him, and asked if any of the neighbours knew him - he said nobody knew him there. I asked if he was known at any public-house; he said No. I said, "You young rascal, you have stolen it I am certain" - he firmly stood by me, but at last ran from me, saying he would fetch his father. It was about four o'clock. I ran back towards the slaughter-house, and met my fellow-servant, who had the keys; the poney remained in the slaughter-house. I found out that evening where he lived, went there, and saw his aunt - but did not see him again till he was apprehended in Bartholomew-close, on the Thursday evening. I shewed the same poney to the prosecutor on Saturday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BERNARD. Q. Several other boys were in his company - A. Yes; he was the only one who spoke; 15 s. was more than its value to slaughter. One of the boys is named Crockett - the prisoner might have said his name was Crockett; he did not say it was Crockett's horse.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. (The witness appeared perfectly to understand the nature of an oath.) I live with my parents, in Little Bartholomew-close - my father is a traveller, and is now in Scotland. I have known the prisoner about six weeks; he lives in Great Bartholomew-close. One Tuesday, early in the last month, he came to me when I was at play in Bartholomew-close with one Drysdale, about half-past ten o'clock in the morning, and asked me to go with him to fetch one of his master's horses home - that Mr. Sadler was his master, and the horse was at grass on Kennington-common, and if I would go with him I should ride it all the way home - he said he was going to bring it home to have its tail cut. I and Drysdale went with him to Kennington-common; he took us there, and caught a little black horse; he tried to catch another at first, but could not - there were three in the field; he said he would bring<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030010"/>home two, as both were to have their tails cut; it was then about half-past two o'clock. I and Drysdale rode it all the way home, by turns, and when he got into Bartholomew-close he said it was his father's horse, and he was going to sell it - that his father said it was past work. He took it to Cow-cross; we both went with him - he asked Fuller 15 s. for it. Fuller said Bartholomew-close was in his way home, and he would see his father; he was to give 12 s. for it. I went to a house where the prisoner said his father lived with Fuller - he took him to a wrong house, and Fuller went to stop the horse that nobody should have it, and the prisoner went away, and told me afterwards that he went to Cow-cross to get it back, but the man would not let him have it - he said, "I got there before the man did, but they would not let me have it back - I will go and fetch my father;" he ran away, and I did not see him again till he was taken; this was when I was playing with Drysdale.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Your father is much absent from home - A. Yes. I go on errands for my mother; she does not let me play in the street often. I had been on an errand, and was playing when he came to me. I saw him again about five o'clock, when I was playing - I had been on an errand, and came out to play without my mother's leave. I got acquainted with him by playing about the close. He did not mention the name of Stone to me; he had a halter to fetch the horse with - it was a black horse. I was with him when he offered to sell it, and rode it about the close. I did not know where he lived. I never said it was my father's.</p>

            . I am twelve years old. (This witness, being questioned, appeared sensible of the obligation of an oath.) I had known the prisoner about a month - I became acquainted with him in Little Bartholomew-close, and have known Crockett about a year. On Tuesday, the 4th of November, he came to me and Crockett, and asked us to go with him to fetch one of his master's horses, and he would give us a ride all the way home - that he was going to Vauxhall-common to fetch it to have his tail cropped; he had a rope. We went with him to Vauxhall-common, and caught the horse; it was a little black one - we tried to catch another grey one, but could not; he said, "Catch the little one if you can, I may as well take that home too." We brought the one home, and rode it by turns to Bartholomew-close, rode it about there, and took it into Aldersgate-street; the prisoner told us to ride it about and he would come to us directly; he went to Sadler's yard, leaving us riding it up and down the street - he returned in about five minutes, and said he should take it to the knocker's. We went to Ford's, Cow-cross; Crockett rode it, and the prisoner asked if they would buy the horse, and wanted 25 s.; the man asked whose it was; he said it was his father's - he told him to send his father with it. He then led it away to White's, next door, and asked 15 s. for it; Fuller asked whose it was; he said his father's, and he wished it killed. Fuller asked where he lived - he said at the top of Middle-street - 12 s. was agreed upon, and he said he would go with him, and pay his father, and when we got to the top of Middle-street, he said he lived there, but his father and mother were out. A woman came down and said they did not live there - Fuller let him go, and he went away. I saw him again in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he said he was going home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you often played with Crockett in the Close - A. We generally played about there, and had been playing about an hour when the prisoner came up; he said nothing about having a letter to take from Stone.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the object of catching the second horse that you might both have a ride - A. Yes. We rode it about. He said his master was Mr. Sadler, stable-keeper, Aldersgate-street; he told me to ride it up and down while he went in there. He left the same horse at Fuller's, as he brought from the common.</p>

On the 10th of November, between one and two o'clock, I put thirty-one sovereigns and a half into a box, in the back room, on the ground floor - I put them into the box in the presence of the prisoner, who lodged in the house. I went out at two o'clock; he asked how long I should be gone; I said not a great while. I returned between three and four o'clock - I had left the door locked, and found it so, but the back room window was open. A person in the yard could open it, and get in. Two large boxes were moved off the top of that the money was in, the box broken open, and the money gone; I had locked it and had the key in my pocket. I did not see him again till he was taken. I did not expect that he was going to leave - he had lived there four months, and slept in this back room, which we rented - he had new clothes on when he was taken. I had left nobody in my apartment.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there not people up stairs - A. There might be. Anybody in the yard could open the window. He owed me 1 l. 11 s. 6 d., for rent, at 2 s. a week. I had asked him for it, but he could not pay me.</p>

When he saw me come in, he hung down his head, took up his hat, and was going away - I put my hand on him, and said he could not go, for he was accused of robbing Connor; he denied it. I called the landlord, and asked where I could get a constable - he said at Crouch-end; I went there, returned, and he was gone. I found him at Hatton-garden next day.</p>

            . I keep the Archway-tavern. On the 11th of November, Hickey and the prisoner were there. Hickey went for an officer, leaving the prisoner in my house. Several men promised to take care of him, but let him go - he had had a pint of beer, which he paid for in silver, and had a quantity of silver in his pocket. When I heard he was gone, I sent my brother after him; he brought him back. I was endeavouring to put him into the back parlour out of the way of some labouring men, who abused me very much, and threatened to break my windows. I was obliged to let him go, but sent a man to watch him - he ran as hard as he could a little distance - then went through a gate out of the road. I went in search of him with the officer, and found him in Maiden-lane, about three o'clock that day, in the road, asking a man about a coach - we took him to the watch-house. I saw him searched; twenty-nine sovereigns and some silver were found in his left hand breeches pocket; in a small pocket-book.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. How long did I stay in your house after being charged with this - A. I suppose half an hour from first to last. I told him if he was an honest man he had better stand his ground. Maiden-lane is about a mile from my house; he had left my house an hour and a half, and had crossed the fields,</p>

On the 2d of November, between seven and eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came to my house, with a party of eight or ten, to practice ringing the bells, which are my property. The prisoner asked for them two or three times - they continued ringing for two or three hours, and when they were gone I missed the bells; some went out at the front, and the others the back way. I took the bells with the lease of the house. I value them at 3 l.</p>

On Sunday evening, the 2d of November, I was at the Ship; the prisoner was there, with three more; others were there, but not in his company; his party had the bells brought in, and used them - I left them there, and on Monday, the 10th, I went and found the prisoner at work in Gravel-lane, and said," I suppose you know what I am come about; the landlord of the Ship has lost his bells." I asked where they were; he said he believed they were in pawn; he took me to two or three pawnbrokers' shops in Gray's Inn-lane, and at Kendrew's we found them.</p>

            . I live in Crown-street, nearly opposite Pitt's shop. On the 15th of November, about half past five o'clock in the evening, I heard somebody say, "that man is after stealing the carpet." I went up to my first-floor window, and saw three men loitering about Pitt's shop, and presently saw a man in a light coat cross towards the shop; he walked about for a few minutes; one of the others went into the shop, and came out without anything; the prisoner then went in, and brought out a roll of carpet. I ran down, and out at the door, but before I could get round the corner, he turned into Wilson-street. A man said he had got the carpet; being dark I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030012"/>could not see the man, though I heard his voice, and saw the shadow of a man run round; he was brought back in a moment; the other man is not here.

The gas threw a good light upon him. I had a full view of his person and face. I lost sight of him in the pursuit, and fell down. There was scarcely any one in the street.</p>

On the 19th of November, between twelve and one o'clock in the day, I was in the shop, and saw the prisoner, who is a stranger, coming from up stairs, and go into the street. Knowing I had left the first floor door open, I ran up, and missed five table spoons off the dining-table, where they were ten minutes before. I came down, and called my brother to go after her with me. I pointed her out to him, and said she had stolen the spoons. He overtook her, and when I got up, she was delivering the five spoons to him out of her shawl or apron. She was taken to the watch-house. My brother gave them to my husband.</p>

I was stopped by a crowd of people, and could not proceed, and in less than a minute there was as great a crowd behind as before me. My daughter, who was with me, called out, and thinking to keep the crowd from her, I turned round, and almost immediately somebody called out to her, "Don't faint!" I could not turn about the pressure was so great. I put my arms up, and about two yards off I saw the prisoner's face to my face; he was pressing with great violence, calling out something which I could not distinguish. I said, "For God's sake don't press!" and the more I begged him, the more he pressed. I suspected nothing, but the moment he came up to me his hand was at my pocket. I felt my watch go, and saw his arm go from me. I directly caught hold of his jacket, and said, "You have stolen my watch." He said, "Don't tear my clothes." I held him till the constable took him; and have not found my watch. Somebody said in his hearing, he has given it into another hand.</p>

I saw his hand go by that man towards Mr. Drewell's breeches pocket, as I thought, and at that moment a strong crowd carried me fifty yards away, and in half an hour I found him in custody. Several gentlemen said in his presence that they saw it pass from his hand to another.</p>

The prisoner came to lodge with us about January; her husband came in the evening - they had the first floor, furnished, at 10 s. a week. He lived with her but a short time, and then went to Whitecross-street Prison, and then she moved into the second floor back room. This furniture was in that room. She afterwards moved into the lower room, and left in two or three months. She was charged with the robbery before she left, and apprehended.</p>

I had had it seven years; it cost me 5 l. at a sale - I pawned it last winter for 5 l.; I believe it worth that. I have pawned it for that more than once. About seven o'clock in the evening. I came home - my wife came to the gate with the lantern to light me with the horse, and during that time some one must have jumped over the rails, and stolen it. As soon as she brought me the light, she turned back and went in. She was not out of the house five minutes - a child five years old was left in the room where the clock was. My wife let me in at the bottom of the garden, which is at the back of the house. A person must have got over the fence, and got in at the front door, for the gate was locked. I know the prisoner by sight; he was not in the habit of coming to the house.

On a Friday night, two or three weeks before I went to Worship-street, which was two or three weeks ago, about seven o'clock, I saw him with a clock - he was going away from Matthews's; three more boys were with him; he was going towards the Robin Hood, which is near Matthews's; I am sure it was him. I did not speak to him - he had nothing over the clock - it was Matthews's, for I had seen it before a good many times. It was dark, but there is a gas-light by the Robin Hood.

            . I am eleven years old. I was at play with Brown, on a Friday night, not long ago, (five or six weeks ago, I think.) I know it was on a Friday, because I carry pots about on Fridays. I know the prisoner by having seen him several times before. I saw him between six and seven o'clock, with three more boys - it was nearer seven than six. I saw him hang a clock on Matthews's gate, while he got over the gate out of the garden, and then ran away towards the Whitmore's Head, public-house, with it under his arm, and went by the Robin Hood. I know it was Matthews's clock, because I have often seen it before.</p>

I was by the Robin Hood, with Brown and saw him run by the Robin Hood with Matthews's clock under his arm. I did not see him get over the rails. I knew it to be Matthews's, because I had often seen it before. Three more young chaps were with him. They said. "Mind you do not drop it."

             re-examined. Matthews never said a word to me. When I saw the prisoner go by with the clock, I hallooed Stop thief! and ran after him as far as the Robin Hood. I live behind the Robin Hood. I saw him down by Matthews's rails; he ran towards the Whitmore's Head. I then ran back, and told Matthews that some boys had been taking his clock away. He asked if I should know them. I said, Yes. I did not mention who it was; I only knew his name by what the other boys used to call him - Chummy. I told him what he was called. Gray went to him with me.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. What kind of a clock was it - A. An eight-day clock, on a stand. I had seen it three or four times in Matthews's house; it was a brass and mahogany case, with a glass door.</p>

               <p>Q. What connection had you with Woolf - A. None at all; not with Matthews, before that. I was walking up and down with an officer of Kingsgate-street Court, when they came up and asked about Woolf. I was then by the cottages, where the prisoner resided.</p>

On Friday afternoon, about half-past three o'clock, I saw him and another man go down the yard, very much in liquor, He went into his own house, and in a very short time I heard screams of murder coming from his house, and saw him throwing his furniture out of his window. The neighbours went to him, and said, "You foolish man, what makes you break your furniture?" He then came down into the yard with his waistcoat and coat off, and challenged the whole of the yard to fight. He then went in, and began throwing his furniture out again, and breaking it; then came down, pulled his shirt off, and challenged the people to fight. He went up stairs, and was there half an hour; then came up the yard with his clothes on, and a weapon over his shoulder. He came up about four yards from my house, stopped all of a sudden, and flung the thing with great violence. It hit the post; glanced to the child, and immediately the child fell as if killed with a shot. He used both hands to throw it. If it had not been for the post, it must have severed the boy's head from his body. It struck him just over the right temple. I ran out, and he said to me, "Penen, what have I done?" I said, "You villain, you have murdered the child, go along with me." He said he would go any where, and made no resistance. I saw the child afterwards; it was John Dunbar; he was in a most shocking state.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. He flung it with violence against the post - A. Yes; and from the post it glanced to the boy. The women in the yard had said, "Let us take him, and fling him in a blanket." That was half an hour before. There were still boys and women in the yard in different directions. The post was nearly in a straight line with the child. The weapon came in contact with the post as soon as it left his hand, as the post was not above three yards from him. He bears the character of a humane person towards children.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What sort of a weapon was it - A. The broken part of mahogany table, four or five inches wide, and about two feet long. I had not seen Dunbar before he was struck.</p>
               <p>Q. If it had not struck the post it would have gone clear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030017"/>of the child - A. No, my Lord, the boy stood rather on one side of the post, about a yard from it. I cannot say whether he aimed at the child. He was just coming out of No. 3, when he received the blow. If the post had not been in the way, it would have gone straight on.</p>

            , I live in Sand-yard. On Friday afternoon, about five o'clock, I saw a number of persons collected, and saw Shuter in his shirt-sleeves, quarrelling with a number of low women who inhabit the yard. They were remonstrating with him in their way, but it was more irritation. I went up stairs, and heard somebody call out, "Bring a blanket, and we will loss him if he comes out again." I went down afterwards, and saw him coming up the yard with part of a mahogany table over his shoulder about an inch thick. A man said to him, "What do you mean to do with that piece of wood, give it to me." He said No; if he saw his wife, he would knock it about her head. He took and threw it. This little boy stood near a door, and two others stood near; a little girl stood behind Dunbar, who fell also. I heard the blow, but whether it was striking the boy or the post I did not know. The women began to scream, every one thinking it was their own child. They seized, but could not hold him. He began to get collected, and Penen collared him. The child's name is

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Great Bath-street. I first saw the deceased on Saturday evening, about nine o'clock, at No. 1, Sand-yard. I had his head shaved, and then found a considerable tumefaction over the left hemisphere of the brain, and considerable injury done to the skull. He died next night, I opened his head on Monday, and found a fracture five inches and a half long in the principal side-bone of the skull, and another fracture commencing along the same bone, and across the whole forehead. I found three-fourths of an ounce of extravasated blood on the dura mater, which was caused by external violence, which no doubt occasioned his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you think there were two blows, or that one blow occasioned both fractures - A. I should think there must have been two blows; but an uneven piece of wood might have produced more violence on one part than the other.</p>

            . I have known them all for years. We first met between six and seven o'clock in the evening. I generally go out with them on a Sunday evening, but it was by accident that we all met. White and I had been together all the afternoon, at the King's Head and the Wellington, public-houses. We then went to the Duchess of York. White went home to tea, leaving me there. We had a pint of porter each at the King's Head, and a pint of purl between us at the Wellington. I had a pint of beer at the Duchess of York. Thomas came in and drank with me. Nailer came in soon after. White returned, and we all went to the Fox, public-house, about seven o'clock, and had a glass of gin and water between us. We were rather drunk when we left the Fox. It was then about nine o'clock. We then went to the Duke of York, public-house, and had four glasses of gin and water; I do not think we had more. We then came on towards home. It was about ten o'clock. All four left together, and were a little groggy, but knew what we were about, and could walk. When we got to the corner of the <placeName id="t18231203-34-crimeloc184">Duke of York</placeName>

I thought it was done in a joke, and asked him for it, thinking he might break the glass. He put his hand to one of the others, but which I cannot say, or whether he gave it him. I asked him for them. He took no notice, but walked on. The tobacco dropped out of my pipe; and they shoved me down and took my money from me. We had then got about seventy yards from the Duke of York. I cannot say which of them pushed me down. I was stooping, but did not fall, for they shoved me down, and my money was taken out of my pocket as I laid on my back. They then let me get up. It was dark; there were no lamps. I cannot say who took my money. They used no violence; more than one of them took it, but I cannot say whether all three took it. They were all on the spot. I was not kept down above a minute. I thought it a joke, and followed them on a good way, but made no alarm. I came up to them, and asked for the money. They kept laughing, and said, "All stuff!" I said, it was no use playing their jokes in that manner. I left them in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes, and went home. They said they should go to Islington. Whether it was a joke or not I cannot say. I said, "You may as well give me my money;" but they went on by the Rosemary Branch without answering me. I passed Thomas on Monday night, in Shoreditch, as I was going to the Office, but did not speak to him. I have not seen White since. I have not got my watch, pin, or money since.</p>

I had three boxes in the attic, containing this property; it was all safe on Saturday the 15th of November, in the morning - I missed them at eleven at night - I told the patrol, who got out of the window, and immediately under the window, outside the house, found a hammer, which exactly fitted the marks on the window which had been broken open - the house must have been entered that way - my boxes were found in the next house (which the prisoner had the care of for Mr. Bagshaw), broken open, and every thing of value taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Does Jones reside on the premises - A. Yes; she is the lessee - nobody slept in the adjoining house; it is used by Bagshaw to deposit vases in.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was on duty at twelve o'clock at night, and heard of this robbery. I went to the next house, knocked at the door for some time, and the prisoner let me in; he said he was in care of the house; I told him the next house had been robbed, and I must search that house: he appeared confused; I asked if any person was in the house with him; he said there was a boy, who he hired about a fortnight before, and he believed he could find that boy by going with us to his house; and then said he thought he could not find the house. We proceeded to search; he took a candle, and went on before us up stairs, and on the landing place in the attic floor are two closets - he opened one, and said, "Gentlemen, I suppose that is what you are looking for;" and there were the three boxes. I searched all over the house, and could find nobody but him - there were other empty houses in that range of buildings - the trapdoor of this house was shut - but I do not know whether it was bolted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you mention to the Magistrate about his being confused - A. No. The prosecutor accompanied me over the house. A boy was afterwards apprehended and discharged.</p>

            . I received the prisoner in charge at the watch-house, and produce the hammer, which I received from the prosecutor. I compared it with the marks on the window, and found it corresponded. The prisoner had a bundle. I asked why he had his things tied up; he said, because he was going to leave the premises to-morrow. There was a piece of Indian ink in the bundle. I asked if Mr. Bagshaw knew he was going to leave; he said, he had no occasion to let him know.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was anything said about the Indian ink before the Magistrate - A. Yes; he said he used it to practice drawing - he is a painter. I took Warne next morning by his information.</p>

            . I am shop-boy at the house in Regent-street. I left there a little before five o'clock on the day of the robbery, and went to a public-house in Leicester-square with the prisoner; staid three-quarters of an hour, and then went away. When I went to dinner, he told me to bring a hammer, to open some casks which had come out of the country. I did so; and a porter was there who opened the casks with it. I thought he might want it again, and did not carry it back. It is my father's, and is the one produced. I was to have gone on Monday, as usual. I was not in Regent-street after five o'clock. I did not go into Jones's house. The prisoner told me, in the course of the week, that he meant to leave on that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did the porter leave - A. He and the prisoner left together at five o'clock, and went to the public-house. He did not desire me to leave the hammer. I told him I was going to move to No. 42, Monmouth-street, and he wrote it down. He was employed to paint this house. He kept the key, but I did not know that he slept there. He lodged at the Sun, public-house, in Haydon-street. I never knew him stay all night. There was no bed there.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW to DOYLE. Q. Did not you see a light in the shop when you knocked at the door - A. I saw a glimmer of light before I knocked, but it was three or four minutes before anybody came. He had a candle and fire in the parlour behind the shop, and said he had slept there two or three nights on some saw-dust, which was scattered about the shop. He was dressed when he let me in.</p>
               <p>MR. IVYLEAFE. Here is the hammer I found on the parapet. I cannot swear to this Indian ink, I had several pieces in my box, and some of this size. Nothing but papers were left in my box.</p>
               <p>The prisoner, in a long defence, stated, that he was going to leave the house next morning, and was sitting up for the purpose of writing letters and arranging accounts; that he had slept there several nights, by laying sacks on the saw-dust. The reason of his not opening the door immediately, was on account of having put a desk against the room-door to barricade it, and he had to move it before he could get out.</p>

After he had been at work on it, I had it removed into a back room, opened the bottom, and found the lead work was either cut or broken, and a hole made through it sufficient to get tea out, and a vacant space, so that some had been stolen; he was brought into the room, and told that he was suspected of having tea about him; he said he had not - I said I must search him - he took off his hat, and had none there. French told him he must strip, and on unbuttoning his pantaloons, I found about 14 ozs. of tea, in two large pockets, which came round him in front, and hung between his legs, so that no suspicion will arise from the appearance - it would not be noticed in rubbing him down at the gate. The hole was made by design.</p>

            . I am an assistant elder. On the 17th of November, I brought the prisoner into the room. We took the bottom off the chest, and a place was broken in the lead work inside, but the wooden bottom was perfectly sound; I had seen it before the prisoner worked on it - no tea could run out; the bottom must have been taken off to make the hole in the lead. I told the prisoner I suspected he had tea about him; he said, "Indeed, Mr. French, I have not," and pulled off his hat and shoes. I said he must strip; he let his pantaloons down - Glass laid hold of them, and said, "Here is the tea." I turned it out of his pockets, which were large, and hung so that nobody could feel it in rubbing him down - he is a tailor by trade. There were 17 ozs. of tea, and about that quantity was missing from the chest. It was of the same quality.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 25th of October, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was in Bishopsgate-street, and observed a hackney chariot, it turned up Devonshire-street, into Devonshire-square, and drove to the archway, leading to Cutler-street and Still-alley, and stopped there - the first man who got out of the chariot looked at me, and ran away. I put my hand into the chariot, felt something in the bottom, and saw another person sitting in the chariot - got in, and seized him; it was the prisoner. I found these four reams of paper in the chariot, and ordered the coachman to drive to the Mansion House. The prisoner resisted, which made us get out of the chariot, but I got him in again - he said he knew nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What made you suspect anything wrong - A. It leads to a bad neighbourhood, and there was nobody on the coach-box, except the driver - the prisoner resisted, and I tied his hands together. I am sure he did not come from the coach-box, and then into the coach.</p>
               <p>MR. BARNES. This is the paper, and has the Excise mark, No. 132. 157. 158. and 156.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I hired this coach - a man was riding on the box, who ran away. I did not know the paper was in the coach.</p>

I went over to my neighbour Johnson, to ask his opinion of it, and in consequence of what passed, I had him apprehended. I did not part with the note, till I gave it to Roberts the officer.

            . I am a linen-draper, and live in the Minories. On the 27th of October, Mr. Minton brought me a note for my opinion; (looking at one,) this is it - he shewed it to me. I gave it him again, and in five or ten minutes went over to Minton; he shewed it me again, and said in the prisoner's presence, that he was the person who gave him the note. I took it, and asked the prisoner his name and address, which I wrote on it, "William Hay, No. 3, Middle-street, Cloth-fair, I. J., 27 - 10 - 23." I remained there till Roberts, the officer came and took him and the note. The officer had been sent for before he gave the address.</p>
               <p>MR. MINTON re-examined. I did not part with the note till I gave it to Johnson; it was the same I received from the prisoner. I had sent for an officer before he gave his address, but I do not think that he knew it, as I am certain nothing passed on the subject. Johnson came to my shop about ten minutes after I returned. I cannot say what made the prisoner remain so long in my shop. When I dealt with him, he lodged at a chandler's shop in Watling-street; I never knew him live in Middle-street.</p>

On the 22d of October, he came to the house; I had not seen him for a year and a half, but he had been at the house one since that time, and owed us 4 s. 9 d. On the 22d of October, he came, and asked how much he owed, as he was come to pay it - I said 4 s. 9 d.; he put down a 5 l. note. My mother looked at it in my presence, and said she could not see the water-mark very plain; he then said he had it from his father in the country, and would put his address on it, which he did - this is it (looks at it;) he has written J. Hay, Tiverton, in my presence; we kept it till we heard it was forged, and then delivered it to Bennett. I marked it in front "Mr. Hay, 22 - 10 - 23" at the time. I gave him four sovereigns and 15 s. 3 d. I did not know where he lived.</p>

            . I am cashier at the Bank. The note purporting to be signed by me is not my signature. It is dated the 2d of August, 1821. I was ill at that time for three months, with a bilious fever.</p>
               <p>(The note was here put in and read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence, written. I was out of work a considerable time, and not being able to make good my payments, and having sold or pledged all my clothes, I had no means left, being entirely destitute of friends; my father (my only friend) having left England some time, and is now in America. Having no person whatever to apply for the smallest assistance, and destitute and discharged from my lodgings, consequently driven to horror and the most wretched despair, I at length made application to my parish, St. Botolph, Aldgate, when they scrupled to relieve me; saying, I was a good workman and a young man, therefore I must go and get employment; but, alas! could not. They at length, by a repeated application, assisted with three separate sums of 2 s., 1 s., and 2 s., in nearly the space of three months, after which refused to do anything further. I then wrote to the Lord Mayor; but when I went to the Mansion House, the officers extremely ill-treated me - turned me out of the Office; neither would give my letter to his Lordship. With grief, anguish, and terrific despair, I went mournfully through the streets, not knowing what to do, being entirely without money - food I had not tasted for about three or four days. Having no place to retire or lay myself down to rest for sometimes three nights, during a week at a stretch; subject to the extreme severity of all weathers; and walking the streets all night much reduced me in health, and my clothes became almost indecent for me to appear in the day time, therefore masters would not give me work; on account of which, the violent struggles I had with my feelings became overpowered, through the innumerable difficulties I had experienced in my situation of poverty and distress; but still endeavouring to cherish my unblemished reputation against the powerful reproaches of a sinful world with a degree of Christian patience, supported by fortitude, as I was on the precipice of ruin. Yet, under all my calamities, I was at intervals cheered by the faint promises masters gave me, of giving me work on a future day; hoping, ere long, that the smiles of fortune would again prosper me, though slowly advancing. At last, walking the streets all night, as usual, I was going through Fleet-market, where the shambles are covered, I observed some paper under one of the butcher's blocks, and when I went and picked it up, &amp; to my utter astonishment were the notes in question.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030023"/>My mind being greatly exalted at the idea of meeting such good fortune in the extremity of deep distress, I naturally, with gratitude, went to those persons first that gave me credit, and paid them as much as I could conveniently part with, not in the slightest degree suspecting the notes forgeries on the Bank; but, on the contrary, after having received the change (being no judge of them), I certainly conceived them to be genuine, and legal currency. I therefore wish earnestly and conscientiously to appeal to you, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, for one moment to allow the dictates of your own refined consciences to take their judgment-seats within your own breasts, to discriminate and, without prejudice, to investigate, whether, had I known these notes to have been forgeries, I should have presumptuously gone and offered payment of my debts to persons whom I have connection, and almost daily intercourse with. Doubtless, in such case, would I not immediately be pursuing an ignominious death, and inflicting upon myself the justice and extreme penalty of the law. Again, I wish to appeal to my Lord and honourable Gentlemen, the privilege of saying, could you suppose I should presume to be so ungrateful even to try to impose on those individuals, after having tendered me so many charitable services; on the contrary, it may be clearly visible I did not hesitate a single moment, from the strong impulse of motives of gratitude, but actually went, and certainly deviated not from the straight course of rectitude, to pay an honourable debt; in order that, should I ever require credit at any future period, I might obtain the same. Perhaps the question may now be asked, When I found these notes, why did I not advertise them? My reply is, that having suffered such excruciating pangs of hunger, and the terrific scenes of the inclemency of all weathers, caused me to transgress from discovering them. But had I been in circumstances above want, or even in work, I certainly should not have hesitated in immediately advertising, and should have given them up to whomsoever might have claimed them. The knowledge the whole of the gentlemen I changed the notes with have of my character, will bear the most penetrating scrutiny. The affliction I have already undergone, through my being within the walls of a prison, as I never was confined, or did anything to cause confinement, during the whole course of my life, has made a deep incision on my mind, that it will take long are it is healed.</p>

            . I am a labourer at Edmonton. About two o'clock on Monday morning, the 10th of November, I was on duty as private watchman to Mr. Knight, at Edmonton - it was a dark dull morning - I observed a man driving what appeared to me to be a cow, very fast by my box. I spoke to him - he gave no answer. I went after him, and came up to the cow standing in the road alone. I went a little further, told the watchman, and the cow and man passed us - we followed - he and the cow were standing in the road. I said, "Halloo, my friend; where are you going to drive that cow?" He said, "To Smithfield." I asked where he brought her from? he said from Bury-street. I told the watchman to put up his lantern - I looked the man in the face, and knew him perfectly well - it was the prisoner. I said I knew him, that it was all right, and left him. I do not think that he keeps cows. He returned presently, running the cow back again - went a little way down the road, and passed us a third time, and went down a bye lane leading to Church-street - I did not particularly notice the cow.</p>

He made no answer, but I took notice of the beast - it had two white spots under the horns, and a white stripe all down the back, red sides, white on the lower part of the tail and hock.

I returned about twelve o'clock, the door was as I had left it. I went out again at half-past two o'clock - returned at six o'clock, and about eight o'clock I went to the closet, found it still locked, the box was shut, but the money gone; the note was a Gravesend one. I immediately charged the prisoner with the robbery; she denied it. I had her apprehended, but nothing was found on her. We received the 10 l. note on Wednesday in a letter from the others prisoner.

One Tuesday evening, between eight and nine o'clock, Ann Hyder Clay's husband called on me and gave me a note to take to his mother (the other prisoner), which I did; it was wrapped in the leaf of a Bible, he told me to give his kind love with it, and say he was going into the country, and had sent her a 10 l. note. I took it to her next morning between nine and ten o'clock. She told me if I saw him to tell him to be off as quick as he could into the country, for they were after him. He had nine sovereigns, which he said he received from the country. The mother lived in Cooper's-place, Newport-market.</p>

I said I was certain he had; she repeatedly denied it. I said he had been seen up stairs. She then said he had been in the sitting-room, but not in the bed-room. Next morning at nine o'clock I went to fetch her from the watch-house, and on our way towards the elder prisoner's house, I told her I had found that her husband and her had been in the bed-room together; she then said they had. We met the elder prisoner, who wished me to go to a public house while she fetched the younger prisoner's sister, which I did; she returned, and soon after went in search of her again till nearly twelve o'clock - the sister never came, and I took the younger prisoner to Bow-street, and in consequence of information, I went to Hiverson's, and about nine o'clock, that night, met the elder prisoner, near her own house, and asked if she had seen her son; she said not - I asked if she had received some of the stolen money from him; she said No. I took her up to her own apartment, and told her I was confident she had received it - she repeatedly denied it. I said I knew she had the 10 l. note, for I had the girl in custody who brought it to her; she then said, "I did have it, and have sent it to Mr. Byrn." As I took her to the watch-house, I said, "You had the 10 l. note in your possession all the time you were with me this morning, why did not you deliver it up?" she said she was afraid, she did not know what to do, she did it for the best.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. What servants have you - A. An elderly lady, who keeps two servants; her grand-daughter and her governess were in the house at the time. I was not alarmed at all that night.</p>

            . I am sergeant of the early watch. On the 21st of November, between eight and nine o'clock at night, I came into Manchester-street, and saw a man going into No. 28, very quietly - he entered the house, but I did not see him open the door. I crossed over -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030025"/>found it was not shut - I pressed it, and found a resistance from within, and saw the reflection of a light over the door, which soon disappeared. I said, "I beg pardon, it is the watchman," and the door was immediately closed. I stepped a few paces back, and in two minutes the prisoner Rodham came out, followed by Nignag, who I tried to seize, but he ran away - I sprang my rattle and pursued - I lost sight of Rodham, but never recollect losing sight of Nignag till he was taken by a watchman in East-street. Rodham was taken before - they both ran in the same direction. I am positive of them both from their dress, but not from their features - they had the same coloured clothes on as now, but Nignag's coat was buttoned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you tell at that time of night whether a man had a brown or black coat on - A. They wore dark clothes.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I was in East-street - heard a rattle sprung, and met Rodham running as hard as he could towards me from Manchester-street; Nignag was close behind him - I seized Rodham - saw him put his right hand into his breeches pocket and throw something away which sounded like iron - this was opposite to No. 7, as near as I can state. I sung out "This man has thrown something away - I hope if any one finds it, they will give it to me;" and a boy afterwards brought me a skeleton key.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there not a great many people running - A. Yes. The boy gave me the key, between nine and ten o'clock. I took him two streets from the prosecutor's house - there are two turnings into East-street; what he threw away, fell on the foot-path, as near No. 7, as I could tell - several people were pursuing, but they were foremost.</p>
               <p>Q. If the boy had not found the key, could you have said where it dropped - A. Yes. I am sure it was between Nos. 7 and 13.</p>

I followed them to the corner of Manchester-street - returned home, stood at the door some time, and as I went to the Cock, public-house, I kicked against a key, and picked it up, about No. 7, East-street, on the footpath, about two yards from where I first saw the man in custody.</p>

            's hands, and Hurd gave him twenty shillings, on behalf of Turner; they were to fight for the deposit. Turner stripped off his coat and handkerchief; the deceased did the same; they shook hands. Carroll said, "We will bear no animosity after the fight is over, but be good friends." They then fought for near fifty minutes; Carroll got a blow under the ear. Jones was Carroll's second, and Smith, Turner's. I did not see the blows inflicted. A brick-maker, and another young man, also took part, in seconding. Smith and Jones were not holding Carroll when he received the blow; he was carried off the ground by the brick-makers; we took him to the Whitmore's Head, public-house, where two medical men saw him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Carroll was a taller man than Turner - A. Yes; he had the best of it, and knocked Turner down several times. Smith and Jones were among the bye-standers, but seeing them fighting, picked them up. I did not hear them encourage the fight; they acted as seconds. I saw nothing unfair.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long were they permitted to fight - A. Fifty minutes; they were very much exhausted. Jones wished to put an end to the fight a quarter of an hour before it ended. Smith said they had better leave off, but they persisted in fighting. Carroll said he would be carried off the ground before he gave in. I did not express a wish<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030026"/>for them to leave off; there were a great many brick-makers there, and I was afraid to interfere. I knew of the fight before Carroll called for me. I was present three weeks before, when there was a quarrel. I took Carroll to his house, in Baker's-buildings, Old Bethlem - Dr. Read saw him.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Jewin-street. I saw Carroll at his father's house, on the morning of the 27th; he was insensible, and afterwards died. I examined his head - his death was occasioned by an effusion of blood on the head, produced by external violence. The muscles of the head were very much contused - I thought it must have been produced by repeated blows. I removed three ounces of coagulated blood from the brain; he lived a month and two days after it happened. His death must have arisen from violence of the blows in the fight.</p>

I found the sovereigns in her right stocking; she was rather intoxicated, and said it served him right, he ought to have paid like a gentleman. As I took her to the Compter, she said she was a fool not to have swallowed them. She was drunk then.</p>

            . I was employed on these premises. On the 12th of November, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came and paid a few shillings which he owed me. He then insisted on standing treat. He sent for two pots of ale. Other men were there. I do not think he drank a drop himself. He then sent for half a pint of gin, and drank some of that. My tea came; I offered him some; he took about half of it - then said he wanted an ironing-board, and one he would have; I then thought of an old deal board, which I recommended to him, and said that he might have that as it was an old cast off painted board. It was then half-past seven o'clock. He wished us good night, and went away. I and Preston went home, and was sent for in about ten minutes by Mr. Astor, and missed a piece of mahogany from four pieces, which were safe in the workshop at four o'clock in the afternoon.

I had six silver tea, two desert, and two table spoons, which were only occasionally in use. The prisoner's wife managed the concerns of the house. In consequence of something which occurred, I had the prisoner apprehended on the 5th of November. I had him apprehended by Lee; his desk was opened, and among other duplicates found, there was one for these spoons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You lived once on Ludgate-hill - A. Yes. I knew the prisoner but a short time before he came to live with me. My shop-bills have the name of Vipond only on them.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this card. (handing it.) Have you ever seen such a one before - A. Yes. It says, "J. Shields, 2, Hatton-garden." I knew that he issued such cards; he was never a partner. I swear, that he had no interest in the business; his salary did not depend on the trade done. I sleep at Hatton-garden myself, and go to see my family occasionally. There is a female servant; the prisoner's wife hired her, and pays her; but I pay them again; she is my servant. His wife provides the meals, but at my expense. I never held out to any body that the prisoner was a partner. I may have paid for printing the last thousand cards that were printed - "R. Shields, linen-draper, 2, Hatton-garden."</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been straightened a good deal for money - A. No. I can get as much credit as I want.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not been denied credit, unless Shields guaranted payment - A. Never, to my knowledge. I know Marshall, never asked him for credit - the prisoner has bought goods without my direction.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, do not you know, that when<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030029"/>bills have been coming due, that goods have been sent to the pawnbrokers, to raise the money, to keep up the credit of your house - A. Never; and if I had known it, that man should not have remained a moment in my house. I never knew of such things being done. I never knew Mr. Hall refuse to leave goods at my house. I paid him for every thing as it came. I was a witness in this court, two or three times before 1811, but not since; mine is a tally-shop. I never take duplicates in payment for goods. I was never at the pawnbroker's; he left one of his cards with the pawnbroker, though he pawned the goods in another name.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did the prisoner keep your books - A. Yes. Here is an account of sales made out by him, and here is an invoice in his writing, made out on the very day he was taken; it is headed, "Mrs. Brown, to 
               <persName id="t18231203-56-person603">

            ." He never pretended to call himself interested in the business. Here is his cash-account, made up to the 4th of September. When I first saw these cards, I shewed my disapprobation of it; it might be a month or two, after I commenced business; he said he had them done, to bring his own customers to the shop; he had himself been in business. There is no item in the cash-book of payment for them. I should not object to have paid for them; but never knew they were to be printed.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he taken credit for his salary in the cash-book - A. He has debited himself for various sums.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Here is an entry in the cash-book of 2 l. 10 s., paid to Hall, on the 24th of October. Does it appear how he got the money - A. Certainly not; but on that day he gives credit for money received, and carries a balance forward of 13 l. 0 s. 10 d. from the day before; the payments are not so much as the receipts; the balance was in his possession.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Up to what date is the cash-book balanced - A. The 4th of November; it is then exactly balanced. I told him there should be 4 l. left, and he has written, "There ought to have been 4 l. in hand; it is supposed a payment must have been made, and not entered."</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. In your return of assessed taxes, do you include the prisoner as a servant - A. Certainly I do.</p>

            . I am an officer of Hatton-garden. On the 5th of November, I was at Mr. Vipond's, when the prisoner's desk was opened by a smith; some duplicates were found in it, which I produce; there was a small box in the desk, which Mr. Vipond did not wish to be broken open. The key of the desk, and this box, were found on the prisoner; the duplicate of the spoons was never in my possession.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Previous to opening this desk, had the prisoner been apprehended - A. No. He was not present when the lock of the desk was picked. I have twenty-seven duplicates, which Mr. Vipond did not claim.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Skinner-street. To the best of my recollection, I received these spoons of the prisoner, on the 25th of October, in the name of James, for 2 l.; they are worth 50 s.; he left no card with me on this occasion; but when some shawls were pawned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you be certain that he pawned them - A. I will not swear it. I have every reason to believe that he is the person. I did not know his name. I did not take the shawls in, when the card was left. I did not know Vipond's house, or any of his men. People often pawn in other names, without any bad intention.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I do assert, that I never was his servant; we began business on the 1st of July. I was to bring the connexion, manage the business; and proved to him, that I could raise a connexion to raise 1000 l. a-year; he was to bring 500 l. and I 500 l. If we did not agree, the debts due were to be paid, and the residue divided; we were not to draw above 50 s. a-week from the trade; but it was never considered, that was to be my wages. I have rose a business of about 1000 l. a-year; all the goods that were pawned, were to keep up a good name, not having money; and he was so often out of town. I have advanced above 100 l. Mr. Vipond's name being bad in the City, he could not get credit from more than two houses; and I was obliged to pay money for goods; among other things, to Hall and Sons, for hats; they would not trust him a 14 s. hat. As to the balance of cash, it was in his own hands, and not mine; he could never make out his cash-account. When there was no money, I was obliged to pawn goods, and he knew it; he knew I had the cards, for he said to the printer,</p>
               <p>"Send Shields 1000 hand-bills." This accusation is for nothing else, than to get me out of the business, I have raised, and kept Vipond in it. I was to have a half of the business, or the cards would never have been laying on his counter for six months.</p>
               <p>MR. VIPOND re-examined. (Looking at a card.) I saw a card like this before he came to live with me. I knew they were circulated. The agreement was, that he should introduce his customers to the house, and I had this printed for the purpose. When I engaged him, he said he had nothing but what he stood upright in. I was obliged to lend him money before he could come. My cards and bills are headed "G. Vipond" only; no others were used in the shop by my authority.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you see the cards which you did not authorise the delivery of - A. Yes, when they were delivered at my house. No cards were used in the shop, by my permission, but mine. The first card of his was used before he joined me, to bring his customers to the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he bring a cart load of furniture to your house when he came - A. No; he brought a few plates. The furniture is mine; he paid for it, as my servant, with my property: it is charged in the book.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Vipond's employ. I came at the same time as the prisoner. Mr. Vipond then slept on the floor, in the parlour. The shop opened in a few days, I saw the cards stating that Shields' business would be carried on there. I believe they were circulated. Mr. Vipond must have seen them, for I have delivered them several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030030"/>times to customers. There appeared a scarcity of money at times, for I have asked Shields for money, and could not get it. He has paid me in Mr. Vipond's presence. Mr. Vipond took his meals with him. I do not board in the house. I know goods have been pawned out of the shop; I have pawned some spoons by Shields's order. Some silk was pawned once, and I fetched it out. It was put into the stock again. Shields said they must go to make up a bill. I cannot say whether Mr. Vipond ever knew of it. He often left town, but was not absent long. I should imagine he must have known it. The prisoner certainly had an interest in the business; he conducted himself as master, and Mr. Vipond treated him as such. I believe he paid the shopmen every week.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. He acted as confidential man - A. Yes; the business was carried on in Mr. Vipond's name. I believe I pawned some linen by the prisoner's order, and fetched it out again.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. When these pledges were made, what became of the money - A. Mr. Vipond was in the country at the time. Shields said there was a bill due, and he did not know where to find the money. Mr. Vipond was acquainted with it when he returned, and that we had to borrow the money; but I do not know whether he knew it was on a pledge.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How do you know Mr. Vipond was informed money had been borrowed - A. I heard Shields say he had borrowed money on three or four pieces of linen, to make up the bill; this was four or five months ago. It was 3 l. 10 s., which I had received on the linen. I have pawned things twice: I pawned the spoons eight or ten months ago, in Houndsditch, for 30 s. or 50 s. I gave the money to Shields. I have dined there at times; I then dined at the same table as Mr. Vipond.</p>

            . I live in Catherine-street, Commercial-road. Shields was formerly in my service. I sold some goods to Mr. Vipond upon Shields's guarantee. I would not have left them without Shields making himself answerable; he verbally undertook to pay for them; they amounted to 30 l. I sold him some blankets in August, which come to about 16 l. Shields said he would see me paid.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. The order for the goods came from Shields - A. Yes. I saw Mr. Vipond when I called, but he did not interfere. Mr. Vipond applied to me for goods last Friday week; I was aware of this transaction, and refused him credit.</p>

            . I came to live with Mr. Vipond in May last. Shields generally paid the money. His wife lived in the house. The maid-servant treated her as mistress. Mr. Vipond treated Shields as his equal; cards were distributed publicly, stating that Shields would carry on his business at Hatton-garden. We treated Shields as master. I know some woollen cloth was pawned, to pay Hall for hats, as they had once refused to leave a hat without payment: it was about 3 l., I believe. Mr. Vipond did not know it.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did Shields tell you all this - A. He employed me to pawn them for that purpose about October, and I saw the very money paid from the till.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is an entry in the cash-book of 3 l. paid Hall for hats - is there any credit given for the money raised - A. The balance here is 3 l. 10 s.</p>

I never authorized him to pawn any goods for me, nor ever knew that he did. I have his cash-book made up to the 4th of November - there is no entry of any sum of money received for the goods stated in the indictment - he made the cash-book up on the 5th of November, at my request. I said "Is everything included?" He said "Yes; everything." I counted what money I had in my pocket, and said, "You cannot be correct, as I am 4 l. short." He then wrote the memorandum of it. I was once told, on my return from the country, that 12 l. 13 s. had been borrowed from a friend to pay a bill - he never intimated that it was a pledge. I made no reply - he was to pay it out of my property. On the 5th of November his desk was opened - Read took what duplicates were in the small box, and Lee those in the desk - they led me to different pawnbrokers, who are here - he has not given credit in the book for any of these articles.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Gray's Inn-lane. On the 19th of July two pieces of Irish were pawned with me in the name of Hughes, by the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You knew the prisoner very well - A. Yes; I knew his name, and where he lived, for I had his card, which he gave me at a former transaction. I put H on the ticket, for housekeeper. I did not know that Mr. Vipond occupied the house.</p>
               <p>MR. VIPOND. This is my linen - I was not in want of money in July - I have frequently lent the prisoner's brother-in-law money, and the prisoner knew that - I lent him 40 l. about that time. Since I have been in Hatton-garden I have never been in want of money - I have had 100 l. in my pocket for months together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did you ever fail in trade - A. Yes, in 1820. I had prosecuted one Oldfield about that time, for keeping a gaming-house.</p>
               <p>Q. At which you had been a player - A. Never in my life - I do not know whether he was ever brought up for judgment - I left it with my solicitor. A servant of mine had squandered my money there, and so I prosecuted him.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you know that Oldfield was never brought up for judgment, and that the Attorney-General has himself interfered to bring him up - A. I do not know it - I never attempted to have him brought up - I was never informed of any goods being pawned.</p>
               <p>Q. Here is an entry of 34 l. on the 21st of July, what means had he of receiving that sum - A. It appears by<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030031"/>the book to be received by the collectors out of doors from 260 people. I have no petty cash books; his wife keeps a house-keeping book; there are no credit entries in it. I heard Marshall examined in the last case. I never applied to him for goods till after the prisoner was apprehended. The prisoner bought the blankets for me, and the invoice was made in my name; if he became responsible, it is without my knowledge; I paid for them. My private mark is on this linen. I never sell whole pieces of this quality; my stock was taken some time in July.</p>
               <p>NICHOLLS re-examined. I have some cloth pawned for 1 l., and a remnant of cloth and kerseymere for 3 l. I gave the persons the duplicates produced.</p>

            . I am a pawn-broker and live in Holborn-row. On the 9th of November 1822, two scarfs were pawned in the name of Jones for 2 l. On the 14th of June 1823, a piece of linen for 30 s., and two pieces on the same day for 2 l., in the name of Jackson, and on the 27th of September, eighteen yards of silk for 25 s., and fourteen yards for 20 s.; and on the 13th of August, thirteen yards of cotten for 16 s.; the corresponding duplicates are here.</p>
               <p>MR. VIPOND. These articles are mine, and have my private mark on them; the stock was taken by the prisoner, and the account left in his hands to be cast up; he has never returned it to me; if they had been sold, they should be entered in a book. I find two pieces of silk corresponding in length with hese, which are entered in a fictitious name.</p>
               <p>Q. Could all these goods go out of your stock without your knowledge - A. Yes, because they were taken at different times. I missed the twenty shawls, and asked him for them; he said they were gone upon approbation to Mr. Evans, his brother-in-law, they are entered on approbation to Evans.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a situation of two hundred guineas a year, and left it to go with him. We had fifty interviews; he always said I was to have half the business: he did not wish my name to appear, as I had take the benefit of the Insolvent Act; he said he had plenty of money to live on, and would go down and live with his family. On the 4th of November he laid a trap for me; he said he wished me to balance the cash; he always had the balance in his own hands. I had none, he is indebted to me above 100 l. for money paid on the partnership account; he has kept the book from me for the purpose of getting me out of this comfortable business.</p>

On Wednesday evening last, a little before nine o'clock, I was walking in Fleet-street, between the Bolt-in-Tun and Fleet-market, at a slow pace, and met the prisoner; he gave me a daring and unusual look as he passed. I turned round, and observed him following me; he tapped me on the shoulder, and said he was in great want of money, would I assist him - I said I did not consider him an object of charity, and would give him nothing - he kept by my side till I got to the end of Fleet-street, talking all the way. I said several times if he did not go about his business, I would give him in charge. I was just turning the corner into <placeName id="t18231203-59-crimeloc317">Bridge-street</placeName>

I did not see the watchman, but saw the waterman at a short distance, and desired him to call the watch, and the instant I said so, he let go of my collar, and gave me a violent blow with his fist on the head (I feel the effects of it now); at that moment, as he was going to repeat the blow, two watchmen came up, and seized him, and said they had seen what had passed.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was walking on the opposite side of Ludgate-hill; I looked in at a shop, and the gentleman was looking in at the shop; he came and pushed up against me - I came away to the bottom of the street, went into Bridge-street, and the gentleman followed; he came up alongside of me, and asked if I had lately come out of the country - I said I had been up here about ten weeks, but had been in London before. I turned up the first turning on the right, to go towards the Temple - he followed me. I told him I was going to a house to see a young man, who had worked in Deptford Dock-yard; he asked if it was convenient for him to go with me - I said it was not convenient to take a stranger, for I knew very little of the man. He came on a little further, and asked if I had got work or not; I said I had had a bad leg, and was not able to do much work, and was rather short. We came to the house; he followed me up three pair of stairs - the young man was not there, but a man sat there nearly tipsy - I believe his name is Butler; we came down again, and before we came to Fleet-street, I asked him to recommend me to work, or help me to a trifle - he said he had no money whatever about him, but if I would go with him to a friend's house in Fleet-street, he would try and borrow a few shillings; we walked to the bottom of Fleet-street; I said, "If your friend lives here, now is your time, if you will let me have it;" he said if I did not go away, he would charge the watch with me - I said he had not behaved like a gentleman, that I had met with some of his kind before, and did not think him any better than he ought to be - he began calling me a rascal, and said, "There is a great many of your sort about, you want to extort money from me." I said the actions he used were not like a man, and he deserved a lick on the head, and struck him.</p>

Coates hit Herman over the elbow, and said, "Come along." They went up to the gentlemen. I saw Herman put his hand through Coates's arm, into the gentleman's pocket - Coates spread his frock as wide as he could, to hide Herman's hand, and in about two minutes, I saw Coates shove something into his coat. I immediately hallooed out Stop him! and put my child out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030033"/>arms, but it screamed so; I returned and lost them, and in about twenty minutes, I saw them again in Fleet-street. A gentleman passed with his handkerchief hanging a little out, and in a minute it was gone. I gave my child to a woman, and followed them, but lost them again, and next night, when I was on duty, I took them in Shoe-lane</p>

I had bought them all within six weeks, and gave above 13 l. for the set; it had been very little used.</p>

            . I live at Wotten. On the 30th of September, I went to the prisoner's house at Edgeware, about eight o'clock in the evening, and asked if he knew my son George; he said he did not, and afterwards that he did. I asked if he had bought any harness of him; he said at first, No and afterwards, that he had, and had bursed it, for fear it should be found out; he did not say where. I asked if he had paid my son any money on account of it; he at first said No, and then, that he had given him 9 s. towards 30 s. for it. I asked him to pay me the rest; he said he could not, but would give me 5 s. towards it - then said he would give me half a sovereign, and then 15 s., and would pay the whole next morning, by nine o'clock, if I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030034"/>would meet him at his own house. I did not go, and have not seen him since.</p>

            . I am gardener to the prosecutor. On the 30th of September I went with Wadworth to the prisoner. Warrell's wife asked them to go to the back-room with her, which they did. They all three came out; and Wadworth asked me to go into the room with them, which I did; he, the prisoner, and his wife, were present. Wadworth read a letter to him from his son, who was in Newgate at the time. He read a bill for the harness to him, and that he had paid 9 s. out of 30 s., which the prisoner owned, and said he had buried it, but did not say where.</p>

            . I am constable of Great Stanmore. I was coming from Guildhall, and met the prisoner at the Green Man, at Paddington, and secured him. I asked about the harness belonging to Mr. Hanworth. He said he never had any harness in his life but one set, which he had from Newhill. I asked what made him go away; he said he went down to Stafford, to see his wife's friends, and had only been in town one night, and was going to see his wife. He afterwards said he would tell the truth, that he did buy it, and gave 13 s. 4 d. for it, and sold it for 17 s. 6 d. He did not say what harness it was, but I mentioned Mr. Hanworth to him. He afterwards said he did not buy it all; that Wadworth owed him money for eating and drinking, when he kept a cook-shop, and he brought the harness there and left it; after Wadworth was in prison, he sold it to pay what he owed him. He afterwards said he never bought it, but Wadworth buried it in his garden; he lived at Edgware, and did keep a cook-shop. I said Wadworth could not bury it, for he was in prison; he said it was buried in his garden, and might be rotten for what he knew.</p>

On the 13th of September, I lost this property, and several other things, out of two boxes in the back parlour, which is used as a bed-room; the door was broken open; they were safe the night before Watkins slept there: the staple of the padlock was drawn. I went to Bow-street, and upon returning, Watkins had come home and gave me a hat, which I took to the Marquis of Granby, public-house, in Chandos-street, and sent a man in with the hat. The prisoner, Brown, came out with a paper cap on; I told him I wanted him; he immediately ran out, and went a back way right through the house; I followed, but he outran me. I got a search-warrant, and went with Stevens to Dodd's room, and found a pair of sheets.</p>

            . I am a patrol. On the 13th of September I went with a search warrant, and accompanied Mrs. Mills to No. 14 Vine-street, Lincoln's Inn, in consequence of information, and was directed to the front attic, and on the landing, near the door, I found a bed and one pair of sheets, and in the room another pair of sheets laying loose, not on the bed; Mills claimed them. On the 26th of October I apprehended Dodd in the same room; two women were with him; he sat by the fire holding the frying-pan. I spoke to the women, he immediately held his head down. I could not see his face for ten minutes, and as he would not turn it towards me, I touched him and said, "Dodd, I am come for you, I suppose you know what it is for," he said, "Yes; I intended giving myself up in a few days," and that he knew nothing of the robbery.

I have seen it on his head several times at the Marquis of Granby; I am certain it is his by a round patch on it. I apprehended him on the 24th of October leaning against a post at the corner of the Seven-dials; I said "Jack, where have you been all this time;" he made some mumbling answer; I collared him, and found seven keys, a crow-bar, and knife in his pocket, and a bag in his hat; one is a padlock key, the others are common ones, but the ward of one is forced off.</p>

On the 14th I apprehended the prisoner at the White Horse, public-house, in Chiswell-street; he said voluntarily, that on the morning his master gave him the money, he met one Vibrant (who had been a schoolfellow of his), who took the money from him, and they went to High-street, St. Giles's, and at a clothes-shop bought some clothes for 2 l. 3 s.; that Vibrant changed the 10 l. note, received the change, and took him to Twickenham; hired a room for a week, and after being there two days, Vibrant left him and came to town, with 6 l. or 7 l. of the money; that he had none of the money, and sold his waistcoat that day - he had none on. Vibrant is in custody. I have reason to believe that the prisoner sent somebody to let me know where he was.</p>

            . I am thirteen years old, and live in Lamb-alley, Sun-street; my father is a weaver - I am an errand-boy. About twenty minutes to six o'clock on this night I saw Burrell in his cart; the three prisoners stood on the pavement; Cox went across the road, behind the cart, peeped at the bundle, and came back; he went up again, jumped up behind the cart, took the bundle out, and went up Acorn-street with the other prisoners - I believe he gave it to Fenner, as I saw him come back with Leeds without it. I went behind the cart and said, "Master, you are robbed;" he stopped, got out, and ran up Acorn-street - I stopped by the cart; then ran into Acorn-street, and saw him holding Cox; he let go of him; I said, "Master, that is the man who robbed you;" he then ran away. I went to Worship-street in the cart, and saw the prisoners taken close by the George, public-house, in Angel-alley, which is near Acorn-street.

On the 25th of July, the prisoner rang the bell, and asked if my master was at home - I said No; he said he had brought two quarts of palm oil, to go into the country; he gave me a receipt out of his pocket-book, and said it came to 3 s. 6 d. I said Mrs. Hester was not at home, if he would call again - he said he could not, because he came from the Strand. I borrowed 3 s. 6 d. of the landlady, and paid him. I cannot read writing. I left the paper up stairs with the bottle. This was ten minutes before one o'clock; two children were in the room, but I remained with them. My mistress came home at one, and took up the same paper as he gave me. I saw the prisoner again on the day he was apprehended, and am sure of him.</p>

I had found this receipt on coming home on the 25th of July; it was under a jar on the table - I locked it up in my drawer, and did not give it to my husband till the examination; that produced is it.

I could trace the poultry by footmarks and feathers within three hundred yards of the prisoner's house, at the Four Old-way, Enfield. I got a constable, and on returning met the prisoner; he had corded breeches on, and the knees were dirty with clay - the soil near the house is clay. The constable took him; he said he knew nothing about it. I found in the brook near our premises, the marks of corded breeches on the clay soil, about ten o'clock in the morning.

            . On the morning of the 23d of November, I searched the prisoner's house, but found nothing. When the prisoner was taken, he was dressed in corded breeches. I saw the marks of a person's knee on the clay soil of the bank - they exactly corresponded with the prisoner's breeches - there were footmarks - one person had been there with his shoes off, for there were toe-marks - turkey feathers were strewed about all the way, from the brook to the hen-house. I searched the prisoner, and found a snare in his pockets. I went to Mr. Raikes' park in the evening, and found a quantity of turkeys, two ducks, and two snares, exactly like that found on the prisoner.</p>

I went to the Crown, public-house, and met my brother, went with him to East Barnet - we went home - he went to bed. I sat in the house - went out again, to see a young man, who was out, so I took three pints of beer home, and supped - went to my bed, and gave my brother some.</p>

I think he did it to get her out of the shop, but not to injure her.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030039"/>I thought she was hurt, but not injured - she lay some time, when two men came out of the shop, and dragged her across the street.

I was opposite, and saw her go into the shop - she stayed there five minutes - whether she was talking to Barker, or the figure, I cannot say.

            . I live at Ratcliffe-cross. I saw the deceased on the ground. Barker was inside his shop - the woman was not crying. I went to her and said "Good-woman, get up," she said, "I cannot, for my leg is smashed." I said, "Nonsense, get up, and go home" - she said, "I cannot, for the man has smashed my leg." Two of Barker's men came out, and said, "Where is your home," he said, "Heaven, when I get there," - they said, "We will take you there" - they took her up, and the blood issued from her leg. Spooner, the beadle, met her, they said they were going to take her to Market-hill, till she was sober - he said, "Take her to the wooden-bridge," which they did; it is just by. Spooner fetched a medical man - she was taken to the Hospital.</p>

About a fortnight before this occurred, there was a party of people at the Bird-cage, public-house, jumping in sacks - my brother and his companions came there - the prisoners were there. George went to my brother, and took a sack which laid by his side and said it was his; my brother said it was not; there was a quarrel about it, and Fawcett said, " My George shall fight you for a leg of mutton and trimmings." One shilling was put down by each party to bind the fight - they were to stake the money on the Wednesday following to make up the mutton. My brother did not go on the Wednesday to put down his stake, and it was fixed for Saturday night - he did not go then, and on Sunday night George came to the public-house next door to where we live, and asked my brother if it was to be a fight or not? - He said he did not care, if anybody liked to put down the money for them. It was then to be a sovereign instead of the mutton. Five shillings were put down by my brother, I believe; and on the Monday they met at the Pitt's Head Yard, Lucas-street - my brother was there - the prisoners came down about two o'clock, and the rest of the money was put down. They began to fight in a <placeName id="t18231203-81-crimeloc435">field in Bow parish</placeName>

A constable came into the ring and interfered, but was driven out by Martin and Fawcett - a ring was formed by the people - my brother was knocked down, and could not come to time again. The seconds remained there all the time encouraging them. Martin ran after the officer, and said if he did not get out of the ring he would knock his b - y head off. My brother was laid on a table in the tea-ground - then taken into a room, where he laid about twenty minutes, and died. The seconds came to him there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your brother was taller and stronger than George - A. No; George was rather the tallest.

               <p>Q. When the dispute happened about the sacks, did not Fawcett say, "Tom, I'll have nothing to do with your fighting at all, and will not have you fight." - A. No; he encouraged it, and assisted by giving rum to Martin and George. Somebody gave my brother rum.</p>
               <p>JUROR. Q. In what respect did Fawcett resist the constable's authority - A. He ran after him with a stick in his hand, and said, "Go out of the ring, you have no business with it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDEROAST. Q.Were you at the Pitt's Head when the money was put down - A. Yes; Barnes and Collins were there - they did not endeavour to settle it without fighting. George said he did not want to fight, but his master wished him. When my brother entered the ring, he said, if he was beaten he would be carried out.</p>

They had about twenty rounds, and after that I saw nobody interfere; the deceased fell backward on his head at the last round but one, and when they took him up the last time his legs gave way under him - I went away.</p>

            . I am a constable. I was going to Old Ford, and saw seven or eight hundred people on the field, and saw Gibson on the ground, and his seconds throwing water over him. I advised him to leave off. He said, "No, I think of my sovereign; I will sooner die than lose the money." I went into the ring after two more rounds, and tried to get him away, but Martin said he would cut my b - y head off if I did not go out of the ring, and ran after me. Not having my authority with me, and there being so many thieves about, I was afraid to interfere.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Fawcett say he would do anything to you - A. He pointed his stick at me, and told me to go out of the ring, and said he would break my b - y nose if I did not, or something of that sort. He did not know me to be a constable,</p>

            . I am mother of the deceased. I went to Fawcett on the morning they were going to fight, and said I was come to ask him to prevent it - he said he should do no such thing, for if he did then, it would come on at another time, and he should fight the d - d young rascal, and he would back him for a sovereign - (George was present) - and he said after it was over he would find a man to do his work for three weeks, if it was necessary. I left him, but returned, and told him, I thought George did not want to fight. He said, "Go along, you d - d old b - h." This was at ten or eleven o'clock in the morning. My son was nineteen years old.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had there been any quarrel between Fawcett and your husband - A. Not that I know of. I never said I would transport the old villain, or that I would be revenged on him. I said I blamed Fawcett, and no one else.</p>

            . I am a watchmaker. I saw the crowd - the fight had began - I saw them fighting very hard, and I got into the ring at last, and saw Martin and a young man in a white hat second Gibson. Fawcett had a stick in his hand, and a lemon, and at times held the bottle - a man appeared to interfere, but I could not hear what he said. I got pushed about, and at last saw Gibson fall backward on his head. There was a round after that, and he then appeared quite senseless. About five or six rounds before the last, Gibson wished to leave off - I saw Fawcett and the rest of the seconds trying to make him fight again - he appeared trying to get off his second's knee - they seemed to try to keep him up, and make him go on again, and, about that time, the constable went into the ring.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you mean to say, that Fawcett attempted to prevent Gibson giving in, when he was on the other side - A. He went to him - this was a quarter of an hour before the fight ended. I was in the ring, with the mob at the time, I heard the deceased say, long before it ended, "I am all right now."</p>

            . I live at the Bird Cage, Bethnal Green, and saw the fight. Fawcett was not active, but quit the reverse - he walked round the ring, but as to doing anything more, I never saw him, I never heard him say a word about continuing the fight. One Chapman was time-keeper. Gibson's brother said, "Try another round."</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What time of the battle was that - A. About three-quarters of an hour after it began. Fawcett had a stick in his hand at first, but Wilson took it from him; he uses a walking-stick. I did not see a lemon in his hand, or give any drink to the parties, but will not swear, that he did not. I heard Fawcett say, at his own house, that he would have nothing to do with it.</p>

            , of No. 59, Montague-square. On Saturday, November 22, about five o'clock, I was standing at the door; the watchman was calling five o'clock; and said he saw something laying across the road, and picked up a brown bag, tied round with a cord. He untied the cord, and in it was a bundle, tied up in a shawl or handkerchief; he said he would take it to the watch-house, and if I heard any inquiry, I was to direct them there. I believe the prisoner to be the <rs id="t18231203-86-deflabel463" type="occupation">watchman</rs>

            . I am serjeant of the watch of Mary-le-bone. On the evening in question, at five o'clock, I placed the prisoner as watchman in Montague-square, and on my different visits to him, till twelve o'clock, he reported that all was right, and at twelve he reported the same at the watch-house. On the following evening, at a quarter to eight o'clock, I visited him, and he reported. that on the evening before, about five o'clock, he picked up a bag, with some old clothes in it. I said, he had not acted by orders, in not telling me yesterday. He said he had done wrong; that he picked it up in the presence of Allpress, and gave it to some man, apparently a carter, who had come and claimed it shortly after he picked it up. I asked why he did not report it to me last night; he said he was sorry for it, and should know better in future.</p>

            . I am an officer. Between five and six o'clock on Sunday evening, I went to the prisoner; he said he had picked up a bundle on Saturday, and kept it in his box a short time, when a carman came to him, and said he had lost one from his cart, and he gave it to him - that the carman said it was dirty linen, and feeling it soft, he made no further inquiry. I asked if nobody else had inquired for it - he said "Yes, a tall gentleman, with mustachios" but having then given it away, he said he had not seen it: and after that he said, his reason for denying it to Mr. Dana was, because Mr. Dana's time did not agree with the time he found it. I asked how long had elapsed between the carman and Mr. Dana coming for it - he said, "Not above a minute," and that he thought it of no use to pursue the carman.</p>
               <p>MR. DANA. My bundle was in a brown bag; when I returned with the gig, I inquired of all the watchmen about it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I found it, and shewed it to the servant; in about ten minutes a carter came and owned it said it was dirty linen, and I gave it to him; I never emptied the bag.</p>

            . I am a boot-closer, and work for Mr. Golding, of Long-lane. On the 4th of December, I was drinking at the Sun and Punch Bowl, public-house, with Moore and Pestel, and about twelve o'clock the other prisoners came in; we all sat drinking, and in the course of the afternoon Pestel proposed to me and Moore, to take away the till, which we agreed to. Moore kept Mrs. Norris in conversation while Pestel took the till - I was in the tap-room at the time. We agreed to meet in Old-street; I went, and Pestel was not there. I went again, and found him there - he gave me some books to destroy, and some keys. I destroyed them, returned, and found Moore in his company - we divided the money. I had 5 s. for my share. We went to another house, and drank there.</p>

I shewed it to my wife, and kept it separate - on the following Sunday he came again, and asked the price of a hand of pork; my wife asked him 6 1/2 d. I offered it him at 6 d.; he put down a half-crown - my wife took it up and said it was bad; I said I suspected so - he immediately took it up, and walked out with it. I followed, and about six doors off he dropped the half-crown down the area of an empty house. Taylor got the key of the house, and afterwards produced it to me; it is very bright, but is dated 1819. The pork came to 1 s. 4 d.</p>

The prisoner came into the shop, about three o'clock in the afternoon, of the 25th of October, and asked for change for a sovereign, and desired me to select all the thick edged shillings and sixpences, and all the large old halfpence. I selected some, and laid them aside on the counter, in two parcels of twenty-four shillings; it was two shillings, and the rest sixpences; some copper was also on the counter, in three parcels - while I turned my head to the window, to speak to somebody, I missed a parcel of silver, and said, "Where is the other parcel of silver" - he said, "Perhaps you have put it into the till, with the halfpence." I looked, and they were not there. I told him so, and said, there was nobody else in the shop, and he must have taken them - he made some excuse to go out, I followed him, and called for Crane, my neighbour, who came and detained him, and all the silver I missed, was found in his pocket, with some halfpence.</p>

            . I was fetched, and secured the prisoner; the prosecutrix said, he had taken a parcel of silver off the counter - he said he had not, but if he had, he had probably put it into his pocket by mistake. I said, if you have got it, give it up - he said, I "have not got it," and put his hand into his right hand pocket, took out some halfpence, and five sixpences, and placed them down to nineteen sixpences which were on the counter, and said, "Now, all is right" - she had said, she had missed twenty-four shillings. I said, "Give up the rest," and put my hand into his pocket, took out a quantity of halfpence and silver - there were twenty-five sixpences, and two shillings, including the five he took out himself. Mr. Valentine came in - he said, "I'll give you 1 s., and this man 2 s. 6 d., to let me go." Seven shillings more were found on him, but no sovereign.</p>

On the 6th of November, about a quarter past eight o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to the shop window, with another boy. I had seen them looking in at the window - they stopped there for two minutes, then went on, and in a few minutes I received information, and came outside, and there was a broken square of glass, with a cap drawn through. I took it away, came to the door and in about five minutes, they came by again. I seized the prisoner, took him into the shop, and asked him where the gloves were, which had been in the window - he denied all knowledge of the cap or gloves - turned out his pockets, and there was nothing in them. I told him to pull of his hat, which he did very slowly, and the gloves were in it: they are my masters, and have the shop-mark on them, and were on the cap in the window.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I never touched the gloves - the other boy dropped them, and I picked them up, and was coming back.</p>

On the 10th of November, I saw the prisoner in Piccadilly, between twelve and one o'clock, with a bundle under his arm - he asked me to give him something to drink - I said I had no money - he said he had something that would make money; that he had bought a jacket, and would either pawn or sell it; he offered it for sale in the tap-room - nobody would buy it; he asked me to help him strip off the lace, which I did, and went with him to a house in Princes-street; he waited outside while I went in to sell it. I came out, gave him the money, and he said he had sold the coat for 1 s.</p>

This flannel was tied to the door-post, and is worth 7 l. - it was safe half an hour before I missed it - I immediately ran round the corner, looked up Warwick-street, and saw Daly running with it, half way up the street; it was a very large roll; I ran and got before him, turned round to take him, and he threw it in my face. I called Stop thief! and a gentleman secured him. Sambourn came up with a stick, and kept striking the gentleman, and said, "Let him alone, let him alone." I did not see Reedy.</p>

               <p>Q. Did he sell it - A. I do not know, for I went into the shop, and left him with my husband; I found it in the shop afterwards. The officer came and searched the house next morning, and found it.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man come in - A. Yes; but I went into the parlour. He spoke to my husband - I only went into the shop to throw some dirty water into the street. I was taken on Friday, but did not go to the office that day. I have not seen my husband since, nor heard of him.</p>
               <p>Q. They took you up for receiving it, I suppose - A. They said they took me for finding the property in the house. I cannot recollect whether either of the prisoners brought the flannel.</p>

            . I am constable of St. James's. On Thursday, the 20th of November, I received Daly and Sambourn in charge, with a roll of flannel; and about half-past eight that evening, Reedy came to the watch-house to enquire for the other prisoners, and called one of them Roberts. Having heard that there were two rolls of flannel taken, I secured him, and found 23 s. 6 d. on him. I asked him several questions - he sent me to different places in Mary-le-bone, where he said he had got the money, but I found it was false, and in the morning I told him it was very wrong to send me to so many places. I neither threatened nor promised him. He said Sambourn had given him a roll of flannel, and he took it to Crown-street, to a Jew's shop, and that was the money he received for it. I went to Phillips's shop - they refused to let me search without a warrant. I got one, and found a small piece of flannel (which had been cut off the roll) under the water-butt, quite wet, and the roll was up stairs. Phillips has absconded.</p>

Roberts was not there; and hearing some men were in the watch-house, I went there to ask for Roberts, and was detained.</p>

I saw the prisoner go to Ludgator's back door and try the latch; he left it and came back, as the prosecutor's boy was coming out, and watched the boy, to see which way he went, and then went inside.

On the 18th of November, about half-past twelve o'clock in the day, I saw the prisoners, on different sides of the way, in the Strand, each carrying a basket, which seemed heavy. I secured Curtis with his basket full of lead, and asked how he came by it - he said he had collected it about the country. Wotten took Curtis, and on the way to the office he denied all knowledge of Blackman; but at the office they gave their addresses both at one place, at Hammersmith. The lead weighed 105 lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were they together when Curtis denied knowing the other - A. Yes. They got into conversation at the office.</p>

They lived in North-street, Globe-lane; they owed me some money, and brought my wife a duplicate; I was not present, but when I came home I found a duplicate of two blankets and a counterpane; I went to the prisoner's lodgings, and told her I would have nothing to do with the duplicate, but would keep it till they paid me; there was only one blanket in pawn instead of two, as the ticket stated. I asked him to go with me to the pawnbroker's to rectify it; he said he was too ill. I gave Lee the duplicate.</p>

On the 24th of November, Venney brought home a pair of boots - I found fault with them - he felt offended, because I would not give him more work - words occurred, and I said I was told that he came to me for no good. He said if I would go out with him, he would tell me something. I went backwards for my hat, and Simcock was at work in the next room. I said, "John, let us go and clear this matter up." We went to Mr. Sheath's, and found a pair of my boots. Venney said Simcock got them out of the shop, gave them to him, and he sold them to Sheath, and took two pairs to London. Simcock made no answer to it all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate that he denied it - A. No; at that moment he did not deny it - I never heard him deny it.</p>
               <p>Q. You state in your deposition "Venney accused John of taking two pairs to London, which he denied" - A. Yes; that was a week afterwards. I said, if he returned to work and behaved well, I would take no notice of it, and the matter rested for a week.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did not Simcock insist on going before the Magistrate - A. He did not insist. I offered to give up his time - he said he would not take it, for he would make me pay for it yet. We were always quarrelling - I never heard him deny it. He said I had not learnt him his business. Venney was never in the shop without my being present.</p>

I first saw the prisoners, in company with another, in King-street, Holborn, and followed them to Regent-street; they passed Mr. Graham's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030050"/>shop several times, at last Thomas went up, stepped in at the door, and laid hold of the stuffs, the pile fell, he crossed over, and Griffiths laid hold of him.

I saw Thomas take the stuffs from the door; he ran over towards me - I laid hold of him with three pieces under his arm; he dropped them, got away, and ran down Conduit-street. A man ran out of a shop, and took him - Wilson was with him. I watched them all the way; he stood a few yards from the door, with a bag, ready to receive them.

            . I am a coach-painter, and live at Kensington. About twelve o'clock on the night in question, I was coming home towards Love-lane, and in the fields by Cromwell House (I and four more were together), just on this side of the house we met Overend, and five yards further up came Skinner, very fast; Overend had a bundle in his arms; they passed us; I followed them; Overend got into a ditch, and Skinner ran against a bar. I followed Overend and caught him - he was throwing the things away as he went along; I picked up part of them, and saw Skinner secured before I followed Overend.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live in Broad-street, St. Giles's. On the 7th of September, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was called down, and found the prisoner in my shop; he produced three books for sale; I asked if they were his - he said Yes; that he bought one at Cheltenham for 12 s. I asked him the titles of them - he gave rather an incorrect account. I asked if there was anybody near who I could send to, to say they were his - he said his mother lived at Bayswater. I told him to go behind the counter, while I sent for an officer; he behaved in a most violent manner - got to the door three times, and seized the books. Several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030052"/>bad characters were round the shop. I took him out, and met Bartlett, who took him.</p>

On the 21st of November I went out, returned about half-past four o'clock, and was in my private passage coming into the shop, and saw Fagan come out with a hat in his hand. I saw Marney inside the shop. I called to Fagan, and asked where he was going with the hat - he said, "I have bought it at that shop" - I said, I had my doubts about it, took it from him, and he ran away. I secured him, and asked if he knew the man in the shop - he said No. I took him into the shop - a mob collected; I saw Marney among them, and charged him with having been in the shop; he said he went in to buy a hat-band. I asked him how much he had to buy it - he said a penny. I desired him to come into the shop, which he did, and said he had no knowledge of Fagan. I got the constable, who took them; he broke from the officer afterwards.</p>

            . I am a constable. I received the prisoners in charge at the shop; and at seven o'clock I was taking them before the Magistrate, handcuffed, and when we came to High-street there was a whistle, and three young lads came up to them, whispered, and ran on; and when we came opposite to the Black Horse, public-house, High-street, Fagan slipped out of his handcuff, and ran into the Black Horse, and Marney ran up the street - I followed, and overtook him.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw Marney running with the handcuff hanging to his hand - I seized and took him to the office. He denied all knowledge of Fagan, but I have frequently seen them together; and, after the examination, Marney had a cut in his hand. I said, "That looks as if you had put your hand through a pane of glass." Fagan said "No, it was not; for I was in his company last night, and he tried to steal a beef-steak off a man's plate, and got cut."</p>

               <p>FAGAN'S Defence. I had been to buy a cap, and saw this hat laying on the step - picked it up, and a man stood next door, and said it must belong to the hatter. I was turning back to take it into the shop, and was knocked down.</p>
               <p>MARNEY'S Defence. My hat being too large, for want of a hatband, I went to buy one. This hat laid on the step, and I told the girl of it - came out, and the gentleman asked me to walk in.</p>

I ran down into Vauxhall-road, and saw two persons running, pursued, and came up with them in Pear-street, and took one, which was the prisoner - he had ran a quarter of a mile. I took him back; a man said "That is the man, I swear to him;" he denied it. This linen was missing.</p>

I said, "Halloo, young men, what are you doing?" - he threw the things down; I picked them up, threw them into the shop, and gave an alarm. Werndley pursued, and brought the prisoner back.

I saw Cowdray drive his waggon up to within three yards from the window - his horses were taken out and put to bait, and in a short time I saw Wheeler peep round the corner of the yard, look round two or three times, and then saw him bring a sack nearly full of corn from the yard, and put it into Cowdray's waggon - it was a covered waggon - directly it was placed there, Cowdray came from the bar door, called "Charles." Wheeler answered - Cowdray asked him if the corn was put up? He said "Yes." His man, and Collins, a boy, were present. Collins was holding a lantern to Cowdray, who said "Is all right? - put the horses to;" which was done. Cowdray then came along by the side of the window where we were, with some silver, and asked Wheeler what it was? - I did not hear his answer, but saw Cowdray count 6 s. into his hand, or it might be more - one of them said to Wheeler, "We must have something to drink out of this." He immediately ran and fetched a cup of liquor, and all four drank together, and the waggon went off. Daffarn and I had part of a granary between us in this yard - I had no oats there. I noticed a particular mark on the sack which was mine. I followed the waggon, and stopped it at Staines, having got a warrant. I told Cowdray he must stop, for I wanted a sack of corn which he had in his waggon - he said he had no sack of corn in the waggon - he said he had only a small parcel of his own. I said I wanted the sack he had from Wheeler, of Bedfont - he made no answer. I got into the waggon, and took the sack out of the front of it. I said, "This is the sack I wanted." He then said he bought it of Wheeler, the hostler, and paid 9 s. for it. I gave him in charge, and sealed the sack up. There were four bushes in it. It is worth 12 s. or 12 s. 6 d. I returned and took Wheeler. I have been in the corn trade twenty years. I have compared a sample from the sack with that in Daffarn's granary - I have no doubt of their being from the same bulk - it is hedge-grown - the ends of the oats are very green, and some are black.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was not a lad named T. Collins in your employ - A. Yes; I have not brought him here; he was examined before the Magistrate - I thought he was the biggest rogue, and therefore have not brought him here. Wheeler said he had borrowed the sack of Collins - he had the care of the sacks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. They had a lantern; what time was it - A. Between five and six o'clock - the landlord was out with the prisoners while they were drinking - he is not here.</p>

            . I was with Monk watching them - we were within four yards of the waggon, and saw Wheeler come up with a sack - (he came out of the yard apparently,) and put it in at the front of the waggon - nobody was present then - he went into the yard, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour Cowdray came between the window and the waggon, and paid him between 6 s. and 9 s. in silver - the four drank some gin amongst them. Cowdray went on with the waggon - I kept in sight of him all the way; he did not stop till we stopped him at Staines. Monk got into the waggon, and said, "This belongs to me." It was taken into the public house, and contained four bushels of oats - it appeared full.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Cowdray was not present when it was put into the waggon - A. No, I did not see him with Wheeler till afterwards - he paid the money openly - our window was open, but there was no light in the room - they could not see us.</p>

            . My house is close to the Bell, inn. Monk and Mills were watching at my window up stairs - it is about the height of the tilt of this waggon. I was down stairs with a candle in the window, at work - I heard Cowdray call out "Charles, here is some beans for you." Charles went to the waggon and took them out, and soon after he pased with something on his back.</p>

            . I am a dress-maker; the prisoner had been out of place three days, and lodged with me. On the 1st of December we had been to a party, and were going home about eleven o'clock, and as we passed the Blue Posts, the two witnesses were at the door; one of them, and I believe both, caught hold of the prisoner and asked her in, to have half a pint of gin; I wished her not to go - she did not at first, but they caught hold of her and forced her in, and used very ill language at the door. The prisoner then called for half a pint of gin - both the witnesses partook of it: they stood outside the bar; and they called for another half-pint - I drank none of it. There was a quarrel in the tap-room; Hall and Probin were very much intoxicated, and could scarcely walk - the prisoner was only a little so. The patrol came in, and turned these three women out of the bar (Hall, Probin, and the prisoner); the prisoner had gone into the bar with them in consequence of the quarrel - they were asked in by the waiter - he officiated as landlord; it was the witness, Richard Hall.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went out, what was done? - A. Two men caught hold of the prisoner, and brought her back. I did not go back with her, for the door was shut - I went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live - A. At No. 20, Lower George-street, Sloane-square; we had been to an Irish club, at a public-house in Brewer-street - it was a dance; a man was going over to Ireland; each person pays a shilling, to help him over; I am an Irishwoman. The prisoner had lived servant with Mrs. Coles, in the neighbourhood. She did not tell me what money she had.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did she not say she only had 18 d. - A. No. She mentioned something about it at the watch-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030056"/>door. I said I did not think she had much money - I did not know how much she had. She was charged with stealing money. She had not got as far as the door, when the man laid hold of her and pulled her back; she was not out of the house.</p>

               <p>COURT to BEAUMONT. Q. Now you have heard this - do you mean to say it is false - A. It is false. She had not got out of the house. It was not that man who took her - it was two young men. I did not hear her cry Murder! I was forced out, and cannot say whether she did or not. There was a scream of some kind, but I do not know which of the women it was - it did not sound like Murder. There were above twenty people in the passage - the house was full of people.</p>

This money was in a basin in my clothes-box; the prisoner called a little after nine o'clock on Sunday morning, about some glazing he was to do for me. I was in bed, and my wife getting breakfast ready; I invited him to take breakfast - he consented. My wife went to the public-house to fetch him a glass of rum; a man came in for some money; my wife opened the box in the prisoner's presence, and gave him 12 s.; she sat down to make the toast; the prisoner sat opposite to her, and said he should like a relish; she gave him a herring to toast; he sent her out to fetch him two eggs; he then went to the box, opened it, and put his hand in; his back was towards me. I heard money rattle, jumped out of bed, and caught hold of his hand in the box, and said, "Are you going to rob me?" He pretended it was a joke. I said, "You have robbed me - and insist on your giving me what money you have taken." He denied having any; I said he should not leave. He gave me a shilling. I told him to go out of the room, and never come in again. My wife came in as soon as he was gone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Was there not a little girl in the room - A. No. I have a daughter, but she is servant to a lodger. She never told me she was in the room, and was sure the prisoner did not go to the box. When the person came for some money, the prisoner went to fetch him some gin; he returned and said. "They will not trust me," and I gave him sixpence to fetch it. He was taken on the Monday week following.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not say he would not leave the house till he had his rule - A. He had it back. I found it on my bed. I did not know where he lived. My child came to the door just as he came back. I did not know that he had taken more than the shilling.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. He was stupidly drunk on the bed, with his coat and hat on; when his wife went out, as she had refused to give him money for drink, he said to me, "Nunn, go to the box and get me a shilling;" which I did, and laid it on his bolster. I said, "You had better put it away, or you will get me into disgrace." He started out of bed, and charged me with stealing it out of his box. I called him a scoundrel, and said I would not stop in his house. I went out and told the neighbours, who came round. I remained there till Mrs. Elton returned, and told her her husband was a scoundrel and vagabond - that I would have struck him, if he had not been older than me, and I must have my rule; he took it from under his bolster, and she handed it out to me.</p>

I saw Pasby throw away a handkerchief, containing two table cloths; they ran further, and threw away a frock and waistcoat, which was picked up, and given to me - the other got away. I told them they had stolen the things; Pasby said he picked them up in the lane, and that Thickett had given him a tablecloth. He claimed the handkerchief the tablecloths were wrapped in.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was fetched, and questioned the servants about the notes, and on examining the prisoner's box, I found the articles stated in the indictment - she denied all knowledge of them - she unlocked the box herself. I found a piece of silk pinned under her gown; she unpinned it, and threw it down. I took it up, and she insisted on it that she never had it about her, and that none of the things were Mrs. Byrne's - that she picked the ring up in the passage - the child had the eye-glass to play with, and she put it into her box.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Saturday, the 1st of November, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I was in Featherstone-street, St. Luke's, and saw the prisoner, with another - the prisoner had the coat under his arm, tied in the handkerchief. He made a signal on seeing me. I let them go on to Old-street, then laid hold of the prisoner, and asked what he had got - he said a great coat, which a man in Smithfield gave him to take to the Angel at Islington. I asked if any name was on it - he said "Yes, W. Palmer." I found that name on both coat and handkerchief. I advertised it, and the prosecutor claimed it. The prisoner said at the Office, that one Jones gave it to him to carry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You never went to the Angel about it - A. No. He was three-quarters of a mile from Mr. Palmer's, going towards Islington.</p>

             in Smithfield, with a bundle under his arm - he got the prisoner to carry it - he gave it to him at a public house, at the corner of Grub-street, to carry to the Peacock, public house.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Who is Jones - A. A kind of horse-dealer. I knew him at Birmingham - the bundle was in a kind of yellow handkerchief. It was not opened - it was about three o'clock or a quarter past. I did not know the prisoner before.</p>


               <p>Q. Why was the prisoner to take it to Islington - A. I do not know - he and Jones shook hands together. I do not know how long they had been acquainted. The prisoner said he could not stop, he had to go to Islington. Jones replied, "Why you might as well save me this journey, and leave this for Mr. so and so, and if he is not there, leave it at the bar." He said something about the name being inside the bundle.</p>

In July last I bought a pump of the prisoner; he put it into a well for me, and I paid him for it; and on the 17th of November, about eight o'clock in the morning. I missed it, and found a walking-stick by the well, which I believe to be the prisoner's. I had seen him with one like it many times. I found the pump in Brown's manufactory afterwards. The prisoner was taken up that night. I told him he must be an infamous scoundrel to serve me so. He said he did it out of distress - that he had seven children, and his wife had just lain in.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutors. On the 17th of November, about half-past eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner three doors from the shop with this coat under his arm. I ran in and asked the shopman about it - I then ran after him, calling Stop thief! He ran a little distance, and then dropped it, and was secured without my losing sight of him. I picked it up.</p>

            . We live in Mincing-lane. On the 12th of November, in the morning, I went with my sister to the Horse and Groom, public-house, Theobald's-road, to call on Thornborough. He came in while we were there. Jones sat there. We had a pint of beer, and in half an hour went to the <placeName id="t18231203-168-crimeloc906">Three Canns, public-house, Laystall-street</placeName>

As we were going out, the landlord said, "There is some bread and cheese to pay for;" and having no money, I gave him my bundle, containing these things, to keep till we returned, as my sister had money. We went to the wake. Thornborough left us two hours, and then returned to the wake with two pots of beer, and my parcel. I opened it, and missed the bombazeen and linen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not you order your sister to pawn the things to get some porter at the wake - A. No. I am married.</p>
               <p>Q. The bill of parcels for these things is made out to Mrs. Lee - A. I was living with Mrs. Lee at the time. I did not call myself Lee before the Magistrate. I do not know where my sister is. - I did not authorise her to pawn them.</p>

               <p>ASBURY'S Defence. When I came home on Monday. I went into my brother's room, which is next to mine. I saw Groves, Aldridge, and a young woman there, and the box on the bed. He said it was a box he got from his brother, and asked me to carry it up to the room for him, while he got the key. We both sleep together. I carried<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030063"/>it up - he opened it, and gave Aldrige a comb. I asked where he got it - he said from his brother, and laughed, and gave me several things, which I gave the young women.</p>

Johnson wished a woman to search him, and the woman found this opera glass and weights in a large pocket which she had before her. She said the weights were brought from the East Indies by her brother, and the opera glass was her own, and she was going to sell it. Lawson said they did belong to her, and that she knew her brother gave them to her.</p>

On Saturday morning the officer brought it to me - I had not missed it; it has my master's crest on it. I never saw Gent at the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. He was not in the house on Sunday - A. Not that I recollect; he might have been there. I tied my linen up myself, and am certain the skewer was not among it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Cotterell, pawnbroker, Oxford-street. On Thursday, the 27th of November, Herbert brought this skewer for sale, about half-past seven o'clock - it is worth a guinea. He said it was his own - I asked how he came by it; he said he found it in a hackney coach that afternoon, that he was waterman at a stand, and gave his name as Thompson, No. 24, Mary-le-bone-lane - that his coach put up at Willis's, High-street. I kept the skewer; I did not tell him my suspicions, but desired him to call next morning - he did not call till half-past five o'clock; Gent was then with him; I said, "I was just thinking about you, I am going about the skewer" - he said, "Can't you settle it now, I am in a great hurry, and have come a long way." I said I had not made enquiry yet, and asked how far he had come - he said, from No. 24, King-street, and that he was a coachman, and drove No. 42, and Gates, of Cumberland-mews, was the owner of the coach. I said he had given a false address, and gave him in charge. Gent began to be very insolent to the officer, and said he was with him when he found it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take down the conversation - A. I took down the address he gave. If the shop had not been full, I should have given him in charge the first time he came.</p>

I always<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030064"/>took his linen out of the drawer myself, and the skewer was among it - the pantry is always open. I intended to take it back, but being in liquor, I asked the pawnbroker the value of it, and told him to take care of it, and I would call to-morrow for it. I took Gent to clear it up. I said, "I shall make an excuse, and say I found it in a coach;" he said he would say the same.</p>

Sheen was set to watch; and on Tuesday, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I came out and saw some men lurking about - they spoke to each other and went away, and in about twenty minutes I heard Stapleton was taken.

            . I am a farrier, and live in Church-street. On the evening of the 21st of October, I saw two men (not the prisoners) lurking about these premises - I watched them from half-past six till twenty minutes to eight o'clock. Sheen came up. I went with him to the shed, and found Stapleton laying under a cart, on the premises. The gate had been padlocked - they could creep under the gate into the yard - the lead was just by him, and inside the shed I found a coat, which I am positive belonged to the prisoner Robins - I have seen him wear it - I knew both the prisoners before.</p>

On the 26th of November, in the morning, I was in the work-shop; he said there was a knock at the door - he went and opened it. I said I did not hear a knock; he said somebody wanted to speak to him round the corner. I went to the door, but could see nobody; he went home soon after, telling me he had to meet a young woman to go to his sister's in Chandos-street. I followed him, missed him suddenly, and on returning met him in Broadway, Westminster, and followed him to No. 8, Grenville-street, Somer's-town, having learnt that Bolton, a brush-maker, lived there; I went home, and missed three gross and a dozen brush handles. I went to Bolton that night - the prisoner did not come to work afterwards, and on Friday, I took him at his lodging - he denied the charge.

            . I am a pawnbroker, and live in Whitecross-street. About half-past seven o'clock in the evening of the 17th of November, the prisoners came to pawn this dress - Flannagan gave it to me, and the other took the money. I heard it was stolen. On the 2d of December, Flannagan came to pawn two articles, and I detained her - she said a girl named Betsey gave her the dress to pawn. I knew her before, and did not think her the thief. She asked Butterworth what name it was to be pawned in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You knew Flannagan - A. Yes; she appeared to come to shew Butterworth the shop; she asked her if 7 s. would do for it, and Butterworth took the money.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the 4th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, I met the prisoners and another boy in Hackney-road, coming from Hackney. Leary had a bag across his shoulder, and asked if I would buy some shoes. I said I would look at them;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182312030068"/>he had these shoes and a brush - I asked how he came by them - he said it did not matter to me - I said I suspected he had stolen them, and secured them. Colony said he would go and fetch his father, for he knew where he got them. Leary said he could fetch his father - the other escaped; they said they lived in Kingsland-road, and would shew me where they got them: they wanted to turn up Haggerston-lane - I said this was not the way they came, and at last they said they brought them from Hackney.</p>

I stopped him, and asked where he got them. He said from a street just by, and was taking them to his master, Barker, of Saffron-hill. I went to Barker, returned, and told him Barker had sent him for none. He then said the man gave them to him to carry.</p>

I then heard him come down again - he crossed the yard to the same place, stood with the door half open, peeping out. I was at the window, and saw him come out to the end of the yard, and snatch at this shirt - he got it off the line the second time. I ran across the room, intending to stop him, but being ill, I had not strength enough to get down, and he went out.</p>

On the 4th of December, between twelve and one o'clock, I came down into the kitchen, and saw the prisoner going out of the kitchen - he was a stranger. I went to him, he asked if I wanted to buy scowering-paper? The area-gate was locked upon him - he came down to ask me to let him out, and by that time I had missed the spoons and a silver knife from the kitchen closet. I said he had been into the kitchen - he said he had not, and offered to strip himself. I told him to go into the kitchen; he then knelt down, and said if I would not send for an officer he would tell me where the property was; he took me to the coal-cellar, and shewed me an iron spoon and a desert knife - the rest are still missing.</p>
