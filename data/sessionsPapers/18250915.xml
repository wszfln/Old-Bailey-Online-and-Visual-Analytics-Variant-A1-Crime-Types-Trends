I was alarmed at four o'clock in the morning, by the watchman; I got up, and went down. My house was under repair; the prisoners lived next door, at No. 19: I have a parlour behind my shop - it is separated from the shop by a door, which I locked that night, and had the key in my bed-room. Upon getting up I found my shop rifled. I lost nearly one hundred yards of broad cloth, and other property - in value above 100 l. in all, and have recovered all but about 40 l. worth. I received information from the watchman, and placed people to watch the back and front of the prisoner's house. I received information from my son, Philip, which led me to suspect the prisoners. I went to Queen-square a little before six o'clock - Pace returned with me, and examined my premises; we got a search-warrant, and searched the elder prisoner's premises, and in the cellar found in a large grape jar some black silk twist, and four remnants of cloth, containing nine or ten yards in all - in another part of the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150004"/>cellar I found some of the property in a sack, and the rest tied in bundles; part of them have been returned to me: Woodbury has had possession of the rest. The elder prisoner had called at my house two or three days previous to the robbery; I was at the door as he passed, and he said, "Mr. Woolf, you are having a grand alteration made here;" I asked him to walk in to look at it, which he did; and the afternoon before the robbery he came in and went back, and asked the workmen to lend him a screw-driver. About five o'clock on the morning of the robbery I saw him looking out of his window - it might be ten minutes past five; the alarm had then been given. The elder prisoner is a carpenter - his son lives with him. There is a cow-house behind my house; the loft window of which looks into my yard. My shop ticket still remained on the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How long have you lived there? A. Twelve months. I believe he has lived there seven years - one Ratcliff lodged with him. I saw Ratcliff looking out of window at half-past five o'clock; I do not know whether he had his shirt sleeves up - I believe they were. I searched the premises about eleven o'clock; the elder prisoner and his wife were there: I told him what we came about; he said we might search, but should find nothing. When we asked for a light one was brought. Pace asked him to go into the cellar with us, which he did, and was then taken into custody; his son was taken soon after.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The door between the shop and parlour was broken open - but how did the persons get into your house? A. The box of the lock of the parlour door was wrenched; the back of my house was quite open to the yard, as an alteration was being made; any one in the yard could come into the parlour without obstruction, and a ladder had been put down from the window of the hay-loft of the cow-house into the yard.</p>

I went to the bay-loft window, which looks into Woolf's yard, and saw the ladder there - any one could get down by the ladder from the window into the yard. I found a piece of shalloon on the floor of the loft; I also found some remnants of kerseymere and other things in the loft; Mr. Woolf took them.

            . I am a watchman. Plunkett gave me information on the morning of the 24th of June; I went to Mr. Woolf's, and alarmed him. At half-past one o'clock that morning I saw two persons, seventeen or eighteen years old, come out of Hop-gardens - I knew one very well; his name is Reedy. I did not particularly notice the other; it was not day-light: I did not speak to them, not suspecting them; the cow-house is in Hop-gardens. About ten minutes afterwards I went to this spot again, as the lamps had not been lighted that night, and I saw another young man going out of Hop-gardens into St. Martin's-lane - I took it to be the younger prisoner, and knowing that he kept company with the others, I thought they had been together; I believe it to have been him. I went and tried the cow-house door several times - it was all fast at three o'clock, which was the last time I tried it. I could not see into Woolf's yard. When I called four o'clock a milkman called to me, saying there had been a robbery, and shewed me the cow-house. I called Woolf, and went into the cow-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was not one of the lads named Roody? A. Reedy or Roody, as I have heard - I knew him by sight, and knew they kept company with the younger prisoner. I have driven them off my beat several times.</p>

About half-past ten o'clock that morning I saw Woolf's son taking candles into Rippen's house, to search, and knowing where young Rippen worked, I went to him, and said, "Bill, what have you been about, they are searching your father's place?" he said, "Are they?" and scratched his head; I said they were: he said he thought how it would be. I asked him if John Reedy, John Flannergin, and Davy were in the robbery; he said they were, and told me to go up and see how it went on, and then to come and let him know. I then left him, went home, and told my mother of it. I then went down to young Rippen, and found him in custody of Woolf's son.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then he told you who committed the robbery, and that he knew nothing of it? A. Yes. I knew him very well, and the others by sight.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. On the morning of the 24th of June Mr. Woolf came to my house - I went with him, and found his shop in confusion - the parlour was under repair, and open to the yard. I examined the door between the parlour and shop very minutely; the box which holds the catch of the lock had been forced aside. I found a chisel on the bench in the parlour; it exactly corresponded with the marks. I then went into the yard, and found that a ladder was let down from the hay-loft window of the cow-house, as if the parties had got in that way. I found there was a vacancy over the cow-house door in Hop-gardens; it is a yard and a quarter long, and fifteen inches wide, sufficient for a person to enter. I desired Rottenbury to examine the back of Woolf's premises in Hop-gardens, and placed Woolf's son to look after Rippen's house while we went for a search-warrant - I went to Rippen's house with Woodbury, about a quarter past eleven o'clock; Rippen, sen. and his wife were at home: I read the warrant to him; he said he knew nothing about it, and it was very strange Mr. Woolf should suspect him. We proceeded to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150005"/>search the house; we searched the parlour floor, and then asked for a light to go down stairs; young Woolf fetched a light from his father's: Woodbury took it into the cellar; Rippen and his wife remained with me in the parlour - and in half a minute Woodbury hallooed out, "Pace, it is all right." I then took Rippen and his wife down stairs, and saw Woodbury pull some silk twist and cloth out of the jar. I handcuffed Rippen in the cellar, and in a recess in the cellar, between the front vault and a kind of back kitchen, he found the rest of the property - it was in a very dirty hole. We sent young Woolf and Woodbury to apprehend young Rippen, in consequence of information. We brought the property up stairs, and Mr. Woolf claimed it; we took it to the office, with the prisoners: the Magistrate ordered Mr. Woolf to have most of it back, and Woodbury has had the rest ever since.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not appear astonished at the charge? A. He certainly did; he did not object at all to my searching, but declared most solemnly that he knew nothing about it, both before and after it was found; he appeared much agitated: both he and his wife offered every facility to the search.</p>

            . I produce the property. I and Pace have had the key of the room at the office, where it has been ever since it was found; it was tied in bundles. Mr. Woolf's marks are on it now.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You found some of the property in a jar? A. Yes; there was a little barley: there were fowls in the yard. I suppose it was to feed them. I found the rest of the goods in a recess at the foot of the stairs - the recess has a door to it; it could not be seen without opening the door: the jar had a lid on.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Could the stolen property be conveyed into the recess without being taken through the prisoners' house? A. There is an area at the back of the house; it could be conveyed through there into the cellar.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. On the morning of the 24th of June I was sent by my father to watch the back of Rippen's premises; it was as soon as the alarm was given, a little after four o'clock - it was quite day-light. I saw Rippen, sen. look out of the staircase window; he was dressed, but without his coat, and had his shirt sleeves up; I think he saw me. I was there when the watchman was calling five o'clock; I then heard a man and woman talking in a kind of back kitchen, on their ground floor, on a level with the pavement; I heard a female voice say, "They are on the watch now," and heard the man distinctly say, "D - n their eyes, let them watch - we have got it safe enough here." I had never talked to Rippen, sen., except saying, "Good morning," or so. I have often heard him talking to his children, and was familiar with his voice; I really believe it was his voice. I told my father immediately.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were you when you saw him at the window? A. In Hop-gardens; his house is at the corner of Hop-gardens; I was standing there when I began to hear the conversation, but went near to listen. I was walking up and down, a yard or two front his house - he has no yard; there was nothing between my house and his. We were not on terms of intimacy - I have heard him speaking to his family. They talked loud enough for any one to hear.</p>

            . I am governor of Tothill-fields Bridewell. The prisoners were committed there on the 24th of June. On the 1st of July Mr. Markham, the committing Magistrate, sent word that young Rippen might have a sheet of paper, and on the 2d of July he applied for one - I went to him; he had pen and paper: I left him entirely to himself: I neither threatened or promised him any thing. He returned this written paper to me (looking at it;) I am certain this is it: I saw him writing, and after he had done he delivered it to me.</p>

            , and a lad they call Dave - they asked me to go to a public-house in Chandos-street, and have something to drink; I said I could not go: they asked me to lend them some halfpence - I told them I had none. I gave them a silver sixpence, and they gave me threepence out, and then they went away. At eleven o'clock I went to bed, and about half-past twelve I heard somebody knocking at the shutters, calling Bill - I answered, "Who's there?" and John Reedy said, "It is me, I want you, come out." I got up, and went out - they told me they were going to rob Mr. Woolf's; they asked me to come with them, and I went; they went away, and came again at two o'clock, when Dave got into the cow-house, through a hole over the door, and unfastened the door - they went in. We all went up into the loft, and John Flanergin John Reedy, and Dave all went into the yard of Mr. Woolf's house; I stopped in the loft: they brought the cloth into the loft, and all came up. They said that the cow-man would soon be there, and asked me to let them put it into my father's kitchen while they fetched a coach to put it in - I said, very well, and left them in the cow-house I went in doors, and John Reedy took down one of the kitchen shutters, and shoved it in the window. They did not come for it, so I put it into the cellar, and I have not seen them since. I can tell where they live, but do not know the names of the streets.</p>

            . On the 23d of June I lodged in the prisoner Rippen's house - I am a silversmith. On the morning of the robbery I got up early, being very busy; I got up about a quarter past four o'clock: my journeyman called me up. I dressed myself; I live on the first floor. I keep a shop over the kitchen, and a sleeping room in front; I had no coat on, and think my shirt sleeves were turned up. I looked out of my workshop window, and saw one or two of Mr. Woolf's sons - young Rippen slept in the parlour below, and the father and mother at the top of the house. I went into the front room at intervals, seeing persons watching the house; I was at home<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150006"/>till nine o'clock; I looked out of the stair-case window also. Old Rippen might come down stairs without my hearing him - I met him on the stairs about a quarter before or a quarter past six o'clock, coming down from his bed-room; there are other lodgers. I had not seen or heard of him till I met him on the stairs.</p>
               <p>PHILIP WOOLF re-examined. I am quite positive that old Rippen is the man whom I saw looking out of window - it was just before the watchman called five o'clock. I know the last witness by sight.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What window was it? A. The stair-case window, which looks into Hop-gardens. I did not see the last witness looking out of his window, to the best of my knowledge, but there are two windows looking into Hop-gardens, his and the stair-case. I only saw him at the stair-case window.</p>
               <p>HENRY RATCLIFF re-examined. I did not see Rippen at the window that morning. I saw Philip Woolf several times when I was looking out of each window, both at the back and front of the house.</p>

On Tuesday, the 12th of July, when I got up in the morning I left my watch under my pillow; it is gold, and cost me eight guineas about a fortnight before. I missed it about half-past eleven o'clock, when I went to look for it, it was gone, and my bed was made - I am sure I left it under my pillow. The prisoner was a servant in the house, and made the beds. I went and asked her in about five minutes if she had seen any thing of it - she said she had not.</p>

            . I am usher at Westminster school, and know that Mr. Grant's house is in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. A little before ten o'clock on Wednesday, the 13th of July, I heard of this loss, and at twelve o'clock I was present when the prisoner's box was searched; she had the key, and unlocked it herself, and began to take the things out - it seemed to contain nothing but rags, a bundle of which she put under her arm; one of the servants who stood by, said, "We had better open that bundle, Sir;" she took it from under her arm, and the watch fell out on the ground; she at first denied all knowledge of it. I neither threatened or promised her any thing; she at last fell on her knees, and said if I would let her go she would leave town, and never come again. When she found I had sent for a constable, she said, "I suppose the devil prompted me to take it." I kept it in my possession till I gave it to the constable.</p>

On the 22d of July, about half-past ten o'clock, the prisoners came into the shop - Godfrey asked if I had a silver watch to sell; I said Mr. Tupman would be down directly, and wished them to wait for him to serve them; he had gone up to shew the lodgings to a gentleman: they waited. I went on with my work at the end of the counter; they stood talking together. I heard a rustling over the glass-case, and turned round once or twice, and saw them leaning over the glass-case on the counter. I saw them both tapping on the counter, and saying, "This is a fine thing," and "That is pretty" - apparently to divert my attention. Mr. Tupman came down, and they asked him for a gold hunter - he said he had none to sell, and they went out of the shop, and before they passed the window I turned round, looked on the counter, and observed two brooches, which had been taken out of the glass-case - I made some remark to Mr. Tupman; he looked into the glass-case, and missed this property. The prisoners had not completely passed the window at that time. I ran out after them, and on looking down the first turning the street-keeper beckoned to me; I did not overtake them. I missed a gold snuffbox, worth twelve guineas, a gold engine-turned case and dial, and a gold French watch worth 5 l. or 6 l., which I had seen laying on the glass-case not half a minute before the prisoners came in. All of them being the largest articles I had observed them; I do not know the value of the case and dial: my eyes were occasionally off them when I was at work. I never saw them doing any thing, but the last time I looked at them I thought I heard something<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150007"/>drop. The glass-case has no fastening, and can easily be lifted up</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At what time did you breakfast? A. About eight o'clock - I have my breakfast at the back of the shop. I kept my eyes upon them after I heard something fall. I had never seen them before. I saw them in custody at Bow-street that evening.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. The gentleman did not take the lodging? A. No. I saw the goods after he left the shop; no other person was in the shop while they were there. I had not left the shop all that morning, and do not recollect any other persons calling that morning. I am the only shopman.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The gentleman who looked at the lodgings had been in the shop? A. Yes, my Lord, but he did not come into the shop after going up stairs; I am certain that I saw them safe after he had left the shop. I saw the prisoners at the office that afternoon; they were then both in different dresses.</p>
               <p>JAMES JEREMIAH TUPMAN. I keep this shop, and occupy the house: it is in the parish of St. George, Bloomsbury. On the 22d of July I came down, and saw the prisoners in the shop - I never saw them before, but am certain of their persons; I had been shewing the upper part to a person, whom I let out at the private door, and then came into the shop at the front door. Godfrey asked if I had a second-hand gold hunter; I met him full in the face; I said, "No, I have not;" as they passed the window going out, my young man said something - I immediately saw two gold brooches laying on the counter, near the glass-case - I pushed away a book which I had left over the glass-case, and immediately missed this property, which cost me about 26 l. 16 s.; it was there two or three minutes before, when I left the shop. The gentleman who came about the lodging was not near the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. When you came down stairs you found two persons there? A. Yes. The counter runs along the shop. I am positive of their persons. I have recovered none of the property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You never saw them before? A. Never. My house is three doors from George-street - I am rated in St. George's parish.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Can you take upon yourself to swear that your house is not in St. Giles's? A. Only that I am rated in the books of St. George's; I pay rates to St. George's. The collector receives for both parishes.</p>

I was down stairs about twelve o'clock, directing the wine-merchant's men where to put the wine, and observed a man walk out of the pantry, with a bundle in his arm - I asked what he wanted; he said he came after a groom's place; I asked why he went into the pantry - he said he did not go in, he only knocked at the door; he then put down the bundle outside the pantry window, in the area, and went away up the area steps; the servant fetched me the bundle - it was not out of my sight: it contained a silver coffee biggin. The wine merchant's boy came into the area, and I sent him in pursuit, and the servants also followed.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Window, and had the care of the plate. I know the coffee biggin perfectly well, and saw it in the pantry closet on the morning in question. On the alarm being given I went to the closet, and missed the biggen and milk-pot, which I had seen safe not ten minutes before. I then went after the prisoner down Bernard-street; he came running down Wilmot-street: he saw me running without a bonnet, and ran quicker. I called Stop thief! he threw down the milk-pot in the area of No. 9. Grenville-street, and was stopped and given into custody. I am sure he is the man - he was never out of my sight; I saw the milk-pot thrown down: he pushed it through the iron railing, and dropped it.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 13th of July, at a quarter past three o'clock in the morning, I was at the end of Portman-street and Portman-square - it was quite light. I observed two men coming out of Bryanstone-street; the prisoner was one of them, and had the clock in his hands; I let them pass, and perceived them hasten their pace - I followed, and came up to the other man, who called out, "Jack." The prisoner, who was forward carrying the clock, came back - I asked where they were going with that property; they said to the White Horse cellar, Piccadilly; I said I considered the property stolen, and they must go to the watch-house - the other man said he would not, and that he would fetch his master - he had some things, which he threw down, and walked away. I directly seized the prisoner, and took him to the watch-house. He said he met a man in Oxford-road, who asked him to carry the clock. When I had discovered where the robbery happened I asked how he could say he got it in Oxford-road - he denied saying so, and said something about the neighbouring streets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say Edgware-road? A. No, he did not mention the name of any street - the other man was about eight yards behind him - he set the clock down - I waited a quarter of an hour for the other man to come back.</p>

I did not observe whether they had any thing, and cannot say whether the prisoner was one of them. I came to the bottom of the street, and a watchman made some inquiries - I gave him information, and found the prosecutor's drawing-room window over the street door, open - I think he could not have entered without a ladder.</p>

            . I am warder of the bridge. On the 19th of July I saw Mr. Ram get out of his carriage with his lady - the corner of his handkerchief hung out of his pocket. He proceeded about fourteen yards on the bridge, then returned: I did not then see his handkerchief, but on turning round I saw the prisoner shuffling a yellow handkerchief into his bosom: I laid hold of him and asked how he came by it? He said it was his own: I called to Mr. Ram, who claimed it. The prisoner then said he had picked it up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell Mr. Ram that his handkerchief hung out? A. No; only the corner was out - the prisoner was not two yards from him.</p>

               <p>JOHN SALMON. I called nobody a liar - a woman said that he had picked it up - I asked her to go before the Lord Mayor, but she did not - somebody said she was a liar; it might have dropped without my perceiving it.</p>

In September last we had a variety of Exchequer bills - it was his duty to carry them to the Exchequer office, for the purpose of exchanging them and receiving the interest - we usually receive notice from the Exchequer to collect the bills advertised to be paid off - Mr. Christmas was then directed to select them, and make out a list of them from the different accounts of Exchequer bills, and take that account, with the bills, to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150009"/>the Exchequer office - they were delivered to him in September last for this purpose - he left our employ on the 18th of June last.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. I presume a number of these Exchequer bills are deposited at your house merely as security? A. Some are ours, and some are merely for safe custody - many of them belong to our customers - by referring to the entries we can tell which are ours; he has been in our house several years - I had no suspicion of him - I sent for him after he left us, and he came two or three times; he came on the very day he was taken.</p>
               <p>HUGH RICHARD HOARE. I am the last witness' nephew, and am engaged in the house, but am not a partner. In September last I looked out the Exchequer bills of September, 1823, and delivered them to the prisoner - it was his business to take an account of them, and carry them to the Exchequer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You took no account of them? A. No, I only handed all the bills of September 1823, out to him to get exchanged for others.</p>

Somerset-house, and produce a list of Exchequer bills delivered into the Exchequer bill office, and sent to our office - they are Exchequer bills of 1823, held by Messrs. Hoares - the amount of two lists which I have is 475,400 l. - they are numbered - the lists specify the numbers - the lists are sent to our office annually - we examine them and compare the old bills with them.</p>
               <p>HENRY MERRICK HOARE, ESQ. The words "new bills and interest," at the bottom of this list is in the handwriting of the prisoner, and here is written at the back of it, in his hand-writing, "Received, 22d of September. 1824, of the paymaster of Exchequer bills, the principal and interest of the Exchequer bills within specified;" then follows a list of the new bills, the number and amount of each, and the words "Received the within bills;" and a demand for the new bills is in the prisoner's writing - the whole of the list of the old bills, with the receipts, are in his writing - all the writing except the numbers of the new bills, are in his hand-writing - the receipt for the new bills is his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to HOMER SNELGAR. Q. Did you compare the old bills with the numbers? A. I believe they have not been examined yet - we have the old bills sent with the list; I believe they have not been examined yet - the account was only delivered the beginning of this year - me amount of principal is 475,400 l., and interest 14262 l.; here is a list at the back, of the number, and amounts of the new bills, issued for them, not giving the particular numbers but how many of each amount.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. Is the receipt for the principal and interest of the old bills? A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What is the memorandum at the bottom of the paper, stating the amount, &amp;c. of the new bills? A. It means that the party applied for new bills, but we have nothing to do with that; here is a memorandum at back denoting that the holder received new bills of the same amount for old ones.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose I had three 1000 l. old Exchequer bills, if I wished six of 500 l. for them, could I have them? A.

On the 22d of September, 1824, I paid the prisoner an Exchequer draft of 14,262 l., and another draft of 35 l. 6 s. 8 d. I find that amount at the back of this cheque - it was on account of Messrs.

               <p>Q. What does the name Christian, on the back of this mean? A. I have written the name Christian for Christmas, but I knew him very well; I read the name on the draft as Christian.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Did you see him write his name on the draft? A. No, but I saw him come from the desk with it. I never knew but two instances in which the person receiving the money did not write his name on the cheque for the sake of reference if necessary; bankers' clerks do it as a matter of course, and if a stranger comes we ask him to do it. I cannot be certain that the prisoner is the person to whom I paid it, but I should pay it to nobody who did not answer to the name.</p>

            . I am pay clerk at the Bank of England. On the 22d of September, 1824, a note ticket,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150010"/>drawn by Whiting, was presented by the bearer Christmas - I cannot swear that the prisoner is the person; I paid the ticket, and when delivering it I ask the person's name, and if he had not answered to the name of Christmas I should not have paid it. I read the name as Christmas: I always knew the prisoner by that name. I paid him fourteen notes of 100 l. each. I took a memorandum of it from our books made by a clerk under my direction at the time. When the ticket is presented I give it to my companion, who enters it and passes it to me - I call over to him the notes which I pay - he enters them in the book and I check them - he calls them over to me as a double check; the notes are paid in regular numbers - if I say fourteen of 1000 l. he says, perhaps, 64 to 76, 1000 l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are the notes entered one by one? A. No, my Lord, the books are printed to correspond with the numbers - we pay them in following numbers; if a mistake was made we should discover it in the next entry - in this case Numbers 6483 to 6496, dated the 1st of September, 1824, were paid.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Without reference to your memorandum can you, from memory, state what notes were paid? A. No. The regular course of cashing this cheque for a banker would be to give him fourteen of 1000 l., one of 200 l., and three of 30 l., unless it was desired in a different manner.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you recollect the prisoner himself coming for this money? A. No, but I have every reason to believe so. I should not pay it to any person unless I thought they came from Messrs. Hoares: I have known him some years, and knew his name.</p>

            . I am cashier to Messrs. Hoares. I have the book containing an account of the Exchequer bills of the 22d September, 1824; it is the book in which they are entered before they are entered in the Exchequer bill ledger: here is an account of the new bills brought back for the old ones - the account of the old bills is in the prisoner's writing; the entry is "Exchequer bills, dated 20th of September, 1823, paid off 20th of September, 1824;" the total amount entered by him is 474,400 l. Here is the dividend book, in which the bills paid off are entered - the new bills are entered into the Exchequer bill ledger; they are distributed into a variety of accounts in the other book.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you an account in the prisoner's hand-writing, in which he gives credit for the total amount of principal and interest received for these bills? A. Yes, here is an account in his writing of the old bills, and each person is debited for the new bills on the other side; the amount of debits for new bills is 474,400 l.; the amount he credits for principal and interest is 488,632 l.; the difference, 14,232 l. is the interest. He has entered 1000 l. short in bills and 30 l. short in interest. Here is Miss Wood's Exchequer bill account; there was in her account an old Exchequer bill of 1000 l. No. 10,588; it is marked in the prisoner's hand-writing as having been paid off to the 20th of September, 1824, and her account is not credited for any new bill in the room of it - the interest on that bill is exactly 30 l.; if it had been paid off she would have had credit for 1030 l., principal and interest; it was the prisoner's business to give her credit for that amount - she is not credited for principal or interest.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it customary when a draft on the Bank is received from the paymaster of the Exchequer, to carry that draft for payment on the same day? A. Certainly not - he ought to have brought this draft to the banking-house, and another clerk would have to take it to the Bank the next day. There are two clerks named Ryder and Lee; one of whom would have to receive it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Are all the pages in that book in the prisoner's writing? A. Yes. - The entry of the old bill on Miss Wood's account is dated the 22d of September, 1823. If it had been delivered to her there would be written against it, delivered on such a day, but he has written against it, "paid off on the 20th of September, 1824;" he should have entered a new bill on the credit side. If she had received the bill she must have given an order for the delivery of it; if it had been paid off in money the cash would have been carried to her general account, which is not here. I never quarrelled with the prisoner. I never write for newspapers.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this paper, is it your writing? A. Yes; I do know that I wrote any more of that sort - I might have written two, but will swear I did not write three. I sent one to the Times newspaper - I sent them no other communication, and know of none being sent; that was sent to a newspaper-office. I sent a notice to the Herald also, and I went to the Times office; I had some conversation with the publisher, but cannot say whether I left one there - I called no where else. I thought it so black against him that the public ought to know it.</p>
               <p>Q. You sent this notice to the papers, "Mr. Christmas, for robbing Messrs. Hoares, will be publicly examined at Bow-street, this evening?" A. Yes, that is it. I was not directed by any of our firm to do so; I expect no advancement by his fall. I said nothing at the Times-office but that he would be examined that night. I never furnished materials for any of the articles which appeared there.</p>
               <p>Q. The interest entered in the book tallies with the principal sum entered? A. Yes. The entry is made on the 22d of September, the day on which they were paid off - the interest is added to the principal, to make the two sums tally - there is 1000 l. principal, and 30 l. interest omitted; but here is a list in his hand-writing, in which he enters both those sums. This particular bill is entered there; here is a list of Exchequer bills, which should tally with the other, but it does not. The first amounts to 475,400 l.; it is a rough copy, made out from the bill-book. In the other list the bill, No. 10,588, is omitted.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. Q. Where does that list come from? A. From the banking-house; the casting up makes the amount 474,400 l, and interest 14,232 l.; but it is cast wrong - 1000 l. principal and 30 l. interest; although there is but two items to cast up: if the bill had been paid off the money would be entered; this bill is not entered to her account any where.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. On your solemn oath are not the figures 474,700 in another person's writing? A. They are very like his figures.</p>
               <p>Q. They are one of the two sums which would make the 475,400 l.? A. Yes. I can swear to all the rest of the figures.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Here is 474,700 l. - have you any doubt of the figure 7 being in his writing? A. I cannot swear to that particular line being his, but to all the rest - the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150011"/>casting up is in his writing, and that is where the inaccuracy lies. Both the totals of principal and interest are his writing.</p>

            . I am a clerk in the banking-house. I have examined the Exchequer bills with the prisoner's list. I have examined all the books, and find all the bills correspond, except ten of 100 l.; they make 474,400 l., but it should be 475,400 l. to tally with the old bills. The 1000 l. bills tally; the deficiency is in ten of 100 l.</p>
               <p>Q. You could not tell the number of each bill? A. Not as to the actual number, but I compare the number of bills belonging to different people with the new bills, and find ten of 100 l. short. I have compared to see if the new bills tally with the old ones; the entries in the accounts are the prisoner's writing: the new bills are certainly every one entered in his writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me the names of any person in whose account the deficiency will appear? A. I can mention them if obliged, but had rather not.</p>

               <p>Q. Well, point out the accounts, and do not read the names? A. Here is one, it is Miss Wood's - 1000 l. is deficient. I will state others without mentioning names; here is an account, in which the old bills were, four of 1000 l., three of 500 l., five of 200 l., and sixteen of 100 l.; in return for them there should be the same number and amount - instead of which I find five of 1000 l.; three of 500 l., five of 200 l., but only six of 100 l.; there is the same sum in total: this is in his hand-writing.</p>

               <p>MR. LAW. Q. There is a deficiency of 1000 l. in Miss Wood's account? A. Yes, and the actual deficiency is in ten bills of 100 l.</p>

            . I am a stock-broker. On the 22d of June I received from the prisoner, and sold for him three Exchequer bills of 100 l., dated the 20th of September, 1824. On the 25th of June I sold three 100 l., of the same date, and on the 14th of July four more of the same amount and date.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you money transactions with him to a considerable amount? A. Yes, many thousands; he acted as agent for people - he did not state for whom he sold those bills.</p>
               <p>MR. MELMOTH re-examined. Q. Will you refer to the clearing book - are there any entries of the prisoner's, of notes paid in on the 22d of September, 1824? A. I find an entry amounting to 13065 l. 6 s. 8 d.; it is paid in two notes of 30 l. each among others.</p>
               <p>MR. SERGEANT BOSANQUET. My Lord, we will give up the charge of embezzling the 30 l.</p>
               <p>The prisoner being called upon for his Defence, entered into a long detail, desiring the Jury to banish from their minds any prejudice which they might have received from the statements in the public press - stated that his character was unimpeachable, and that he was high in the confidence of his employers after he left them, and contended that had he been guilty of the charge he should not have left, as while he continued in their employ detection would have been impossible; but entered into no explanation of the facts deposed to.</p>
               <p>MR. HOARE re-examined. I am certain it is not our practice for any draft of the Exchequer Bill office to be presented at the Bank on the day it is dated.</p>

On the 10th of April, about half-past twelve o'clock at night, I saw the prisoner and another (who was tried last Sessions) going down Compton-place; the other man had the harness on his back, and the prisoner said, "Watchman, never mind, it is all right - the man is in the street who gave us the harness to carry;" he then went away, and said he would fetch the man, but did not return. I secured the other man. I have known the prisoner from a child.</p>

            . I am a headborough. I was with Gordon at the prisoner's house, about eleven o'clock; Gordon said he had lost some fowls, and they were in that place; the chickens were running in the yard; the prisoner was then up stairs, but he came down, and either I or the prosecutor said they were his fowls - he said he had bought them that morning about ten o'clock; I then went up stairs, and when I was coming down again he met me, and said, "You had no right to go up stairs without a warrant;" I said as part of the property was found I would go. Gordon, the officer, and myself, then went up again to the dormer, and the officer found the cock in a bag: I inquired who he bought the fowls of; he said of Smith, the dog fancier, or stealer, I do not know which, I think fancier; I said, "Where does he live?" he said "In Cherry-tree-alley;" I went there with another man, and found Smith; I brought him some distance, and he begged of me to loose his hands, which I did; he then drew a knife and rushed at me; I seized him by the throat, and made him drop the knife; he then said "Go to the Benbow public-house," and about thirty persons came round me and knocked me about; he got away.</p>

Yes, when I saw them from the window, but when I had got the officer the hen was gone; I asked the prisoner about the hen, and said Mrs. Pearl saw you take the hen away; he said "I have no hen belonging to this brood;" he then opened a cupboard in his room and said, "Is this your hen?" I said "No, it is not;" I afterwards saw my own hen brought down from the loft, with the wing partly plucked. I lost four fowls in all, but only three were found.</p>

There were only two fowls found.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150013"/>Smith came to my house and asked me to buy some fowls, for which I gave him 5 s. 6 d.; there were two dead fowls and nine chickens. I took the hens into the loft, and laid them down on some straw; the officer came about a quarter before eleven o'clock, and I said I bought them of Smith. The prosecutor first said a fowl that was there was his, and then he said it was not.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper of St. Pancras. I saw the prisoner on Sunday morning, the 28th of August, a little before me, with a bag on his shoulder, and two umbrellas under his coat. I followed him to Buckingham-street, and then stopped him; he went with me as far as Fitzroy-street; he then said he was very sick, and begged me to let him lean against a post, which I did; he then snatched the staff from my hand, and broke the strap from my wrist; he struck me on the head, and on several other parts; I called to a man named Jones to come, but the prisoner kicked him, and he went away; I then saw one of the patrol, and called to him; he refused to come, but at last he came, and the prisoner was secured; these brushes fell out of the prisoner's pocket in the scuffle; the other property was found in the bag.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had been down to Battle-bridge, and as I was returning a man said to me, "Young man, do you want a job?" I said, on Monday morning I should. He said, "If you come to the Adam and Eve public-house, at five o'clock to-morrow morning, I will take you to my master's." I went about six o'clock, and did not find him. I was returning home, and in Tottenham-court-road a man met me with a kind of shooting-jacket on, and he said, "Have you a mind to earn 1 s. 6 d.; take this bag to the Buffalo's Head, in the New-road, I shall be there by the time you get there." Soon afterwards I was stopped by the officer, and made no resistance.</p>

            . I am in the service of Sir George Beaumont. On Sunday morning, the 17th of July, my master gave me information; I saw the prisoner near us; he was running very fast; I followed him, and before I came up with him he had run round some carriages, and had been stopped; he was then speaking to another man; I collared him, and said, I believed he had something that did not belong to him. I am certain he said he had not. I said I believed he had, and, after some little hesitation, he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out this box, and gave it to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were there more carriages<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150014"/>than one there? A. There was only one which he ran round. When I came up to him he was speaking to another man, and, I believe, he was about to give the box to him. He hesitated at first, but, upon my repeating the question, he gave up the box, and after some little resistance he accompanied me to Sir George Beaumont. He said at first, that after having given up the box he ought to be allowed to go. The person he was speaking to went away.</p>
               <p>SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT. This is my box. I missed it, as my servant has stated, from my right-hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Had you been to church. A. Yes. I had used the box but the minute before. The prisoner was brought back to me, and went to my house. He might tell me that he had picked it up and presented it to some person as an owner, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were there some persons pressing on you? A. Yes; my arms were pinioned to my side. As soon as they were gone I missed my snuff-box. I cannot swear that the prisoner was one of the persons; but I pointed with my hand to a person who was running, for my servant to follow.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was passing up St. George-street, and at the corner of Maddox-street I saw the snuffbox laying; I took it up, and followed a person who I supposed had dropped it; the servant came up and said, "Have you not something that does not belong to you?" I said, in the hurry of the moment, "No;" but when he repeated the question I offered it to him. I afterwards advertised for the person who saw me pick it up, and he is here.</p>

I cannot be positive to the person of the prisoner, but I believe it was him. There was a carriage passing at the time. I did not notice what the person did with it. I was going to Earl Carter's. I have no acquaintance with the prisoner; but I attended in consequence of an advertisement.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Will you swear that the prisoner is the person you saw pick up the snuff-box? A. I cannot say positively that he is, but he is like him in size and appearance - I did not observe what sort of box it was, but I think it was like the one produced - I did not see the person run, nor hear him speak a word - I did not see the pursuit of any person - nor Sir George Beaumont and his lady - I was not the person to whom the box was offered.</p>
               <p>SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT re-examined. Q. Are you quite sure the box could not have come out of your pocket without being taken? A. No; I think it was impossible, and the passing of the persons was so regular that it could not have been jostled out but by those persons who pressed me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Has not your master a great many bridles? A. Yes; I am positive to this - there are other bridles like it in the harness room, but this has been champed by the horse.

            . I went to Mr. Jessop's yard, to get a horse on a Saturday - I saw the prisoner there, whom I had known for six or seven years - he asked me if I wanted to buy a saddle and a bridle; I said I would look at them; I then said I would have the curb and saddle, but not the bridle - he said he wanted 50 s. for the curb and saddle, and I agreed to have them; a young man, who was there, said, if I had not had them he would. I took the saddle and curb home, and on the Monday evening my man told me that a bridle had been brought to my stable; I went to the prisoner on the following Saturday, and said heard they had been stolen; he said the saddle was his own, and the bridle he had bought of Williams, and he would go and tell Mr. Jessop of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do not persons in the line of business that the prisoner is, often buy and sell articles of this description? A. Yes, they do.</p>

Williams then went past the house, and seemed to look if any one was coming out; Lessin then went in and came out in about ten minutes with something in the left side of his coat - he ran down Duke-street, and Williams immediately followed him; I rang the bell and told the lady I suspected all was not right, and asked if she missed any thing. I afterwards went with the officer to seek for Williams, whom I had described. I had not taken particular notice of Lessin, but I believe he is the person.</p>

In about half an hour I was desired to go up again, in consequence of my mistress coming home. I got the boy to go up stairs with me - we found the prisoner there, and some things were removed from the bed, where I had laid them about three o'clock. I saw the prisoner again when he came down stairs, and asked him what he had been doing - he said, looking for his comrade.</p>

The prisoner was in our service about three months - this kerseymere is our property; I know it by the colour, the selvidge, and the quality. On the 1st of August I gave directions to William Maton to measure eight or ten yards of cloth, and send it for the prisoner to cut: when it came down there was about two yards or two yards and a quarter, missing; but I was not then at home. On the 12th of August there were two yards more missing from a piece which Maton had measured by my orders the day before: I then called the prisoner and asked him about it, and he confessed that he had taken the cloth out in his hat, and said it was the first he had taken: this piece of cloth was found in his drawer in his room. He is married and has three children - he had a good character.</p>

The prisoner was certainly near enough to me to have done it, but I cannot swear that he did. I then saw the watch fall on the stairs - it was parted from the chain - I took it up and seized a person who was near me, but I saw that was not the person who I thought had robbed me. I then saw the prisoner making his escape - I pursued and saw him run down Strand-lane - I took him, in company with a friend, and while I had him by the collar a person in the crowd gave me my seals.</p>

            . I am a labourer. On the 15th of August I saw Mr. Selby, between six and seven o'clock, while I was standing on the steps, at the bottom of Strand-lane; I heard the cry of Stop thief! and saw the prisoner running towards me in great agitation: he tried to pass me but I stopped him, and he threw a chain and seal from his left hand behind him - they were given to Mr. Selby, who claimed them as his. The prisoner was taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This prisoner had been in your house some time? A. Yes, but he was kept at a distance - he tried to intrude his conversation upon me with vindictive motives against others; I know a gentleman of the name of Rumball - the prisoner came to me from his service, in a destitute state; I gave him livery, but I did not make him any other presents. I was unwell in the year 1823, and, in consequence of seeing an advertisement in the Papers, I went to a medical gentleman's house for retirement, and finding it a delightful situation, I made a temporary residence there; but I was in a state of recollection during that period. I will swear I never gave him these books and bottles. I did not, at Mrs. Willoughby's house, claim two bottles as mine which turned out to be hers. I saw a handkerchief there which I said might have been mine, as it was a new one. I had given him old handkerchiefs, but it is not likely I had given him a new one - but when Mrs. Willoughby said it was her's, I said, "Very well." I had never given him any books or wine in my life. I did not claim two bottles at Mrs. Willoughby's house - I said "These are my bottles I think;" that is all: the prisoner was not appointed to attend me in my confinement, nor was there any person set over me when I was in that unfortunate illness. I behaved generously to him, but did not give him any thing besides clothes and pocket handkerchiefs. I paid some debts out of his wages - I missed several of these books about two months ago, when I was looking for "Ash, on Mineral Waters;" I cannot tell how long before I had seen that book safe, but it was found at the Rectory-house - I did not claim other property which was not mine - I pointed out things which I supposed were mine, but when they were claimed by other persons I did not take them away - I was in Mr. Rumball's house, but I was not in such a state of mind as to forget what I gave, or what I said.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can the prisoner read French? A. No; some of those books are French: here are some old volumes of history, and I do not give odd volumes away, and leave my sets incomplete. When I lived in the physician's house in 1823, the prisoner was his stable-keeper - he was turned out of that service, and I took him in and gave him 9 l. a year.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody - he took me to the Old Church-house, at Stanmore-marsh - I searched the parlour first; he said he believed Mrs. Willoughby was in the house: I found six bottles, which Colonel Roberts said were his property, and he had some at home which would match with them - I asked Mrs. Willoughby where she got them; she said from her son, in London; I said, "You may as well tell the truth" - she then made no answer, but the prisoner said, "It is no use saying any thing about it - I brought them." I then went up stairs, and found those books, which he said the Colonel gave him; I said, "Did the Colonel give you these pickles too" - the Colonel replied that he never did; there were some other articles there, but the Colonel would not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What were the other articles which the Colonel claimed? A. There was a silk handkerchief which he thought was his, but Mrs. Willoughby said it was her husband's. I do not believe he claimed any bottles that were not his.</p>

            . I have been employed by the prosecutor as his professional adviser, for about two years.

            . I am a medical man. -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150020"/>The prosecutor applied to me in 1823, in consequence of an advertisement which I inserted in the papers - he was with me about twelve months - he was a short time under some restraint in a strait waistcoat; I believe twice, for a week each time - he had occasional aberations, not quite so violent. The prisoner was the principal person I had to assist me. It is customary for persons in the situation in which the Colonel was, to be sometimes extremely kind, and sometimes the reverse. I certainly never turned the prisoner out of my house so destitute that he had need of clothes - he left me of his own accord, without notice. - His dress was not such as any gentleman need have been ashamed of seeing him in his house. I believe the Colonel had given him a pair of boots while he was in my service. I should not be surprised at persons who have been in such a situation as the Colonel, being subject to occasional excesses of kindness and unkindness.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did not the prosecutor come voluntarily to your house in consequence of an advertisement? A. Yes, he did. I considered him sane about two months before he left me - I had called in another medical gentleman to give his opinion as to the state of his mind, who agreed with me that he was sane. He would sometimes drink a little too much, and be a little violent. I have had opportunities of seeing him since he left my house, in consequence of his raising persecution against me. This letter is my writing (looking at it.) but I do not know whether I wrote it before the prisoner left me to go into the Colonel's service or not. I believe I still owe the Colonel some money - he was to be with me at ninety guineas a year, and it was raised to one hundred, including washing, and I do not consider it was too much, because during part of the time he was very violent. Part of the time he was with me his friends paid me, but when he got better I considered him capable of managing his own affairs. I received at one time, I think, 50 l. from him, and a day or two before he left me he offered me another sum of money, which I would not accept of, and he was offended with me for it; the prisoner had a good situation with me. I wrote these words in that letter, that</p>
               <p>"I would not suffer Colonel Roberts to be ignorant that Edward was a deserter of the worst description," and I repeat them now. I do not know whether the Colonel is likely to do things and forget them - he would while he was in my house. I have seen nothing to day which indicates a want of memory.</p>

I gave her two half crowns,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150021"/>and buttoned my pocket again; after we had been on the bed together about two minutes, I felt her hand about my pocket, but I could not tell whether it was inside or out; as soon as she had got it, we heard a knock at the door, she said "I have got a friend with me;" there was another knock, and she got up and went away - I missed my money immediately. I saw her again in about a fortnight, and can swear to her. I went to Lambeth-street Office, and gave information - the money could not have fallen from my pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. What did you come to town for? A. To get money. I was sober - there were no other girls with her.</p>

I believe Collins addressed me first, in a great many flattering words, and then each of them took hold of my arms - they kept hold of me till they had cut away my pocket with 16 s. in it - they took my gloves, snuff box and handkerchief. I cried for the watchman, but they got away; as soon as I got out of the court, I found a patrol, and went with him and the watchman; we found them in Fetter-lane, Holborn. 5 s. 6 d. was found on Collins, and a pen knife and 2 1/2 d. on Brown.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where did you lose this 16 s.? A. In Fox-court, Gray's Inn-lane. I had slept the night before in Haughton-street. I had not been drunk. I had only had a little porter - they were found about twenty minutes after, but none of the property was found on them. I knew them by having seen them many times before in Holborn of an evening.</p>

I gave information to Cousins; he was not taken till the 19th of August. I had left him alone in the shew room for two minutes.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you ever paid me any money for my service? A. No; I took him in great distress, and clothed him from head to foot - I had known him twelve years. When the officer brought him to me, he fell on his knees and hoped I would forgive him. I said "What have you done with the money you robbed me of;" he said "Oh I lost it just after I went out."</p>

            . I am an officer. Mr. Pite gave me information of the robbery. I was looking for the prisoner till the 19th of August, when I found him in a public-house in White Hart-yard - he came down stairs. I said "How do you do, I believe I am addressing Mr. T. Pickett;" he said "No. my name is Gray, I am not the person you take me to be." I said "I know you very well, you must go with me to Mr. Pite, in Holborn;" he immediately sunk on his knee, and said "For God's sake don't take me there; if you do, I am a dead man." I took him to Mr. Pite; he begged for mercy, and said he had lost the money soon after he had taken it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Having made up my mind to plead guilty, I have not sought for witnesses to character.</p>

On the 9th of July, at half-past twelve o'clock, I went out with my husband's dinner; I locked the room door and had the key in my pocket; I returned in an hour, found the door still locked, but the property gone. On the 14th I was going out and met the prisoner (who is a stranger) with another person, they passed my door, and went into a barber's shop; the prisoner had my shawl on, but I was not then quite certain, of it being mine, and did not like to stop them. I followed them to Smithfield, then stopped and asked her to let me look at the shawl, which she did; it was mine, and I gave her in charge; she said she bought it on the afternoon I lost it, of a woman in the street, who was in distress: the young person who was with her, had my bundle handkerchief in her hand, she threw it down and ran away - the bundle contained bacon.</p>

I had seen her at Mrs. Corkery's before that and she was very ill - she said she was bad, her head was very bad - the clergyman, who was in the room, said she was deranged; there was nothing to make me think so; she told me something which I afterwards mentioned to Welch, and told him that she had said she wanted to go back and live at Mrs. Corkery's, for she did not like to live there, for she was jealous of Nell Lyons: he said there was no notice to be taken of what she said, for she did not know what she was saying, this was on Tuesday - on the Friday I heard she was dead; I went to Turnstile, between one and two o'clock, and saw her in bed, dead; Mrs. Corkery and Nell Lyons were there; I helped Mrs. Corkery to wash the body, and when I went to the head I found a cut; I asked Lyons how it happened, she said, she had fallen down stairs on Sunday night; I said I would not wash her any further till I saw Welch - I wanted her to move her head on the pillow, she kept her hand on the head, and said it would do very well as it was - I asked why she kept her hand there, she said she was purging out of her mouth the day before - I sent her for Welch, he came; I asked him how it happened; he said that he was drunk on Sunday night, that she had gone down stairs, and he was carrying her up again, when she put her feet on the stairs, and fell back on the tiles which were laying on one side of the door. After this I washed and cleaned her, cut off a good deal of her hair, and said I would go to the searchers and give an alarm; when I cut off her hair, I observed a bit of lint in the cut, which was at the back of her head, and her hair was bloody - I examined the bed and there was a little blood, which Lyons said proceeded from her head when she was brought up stairs - there was a little flour shook on her head; I fetched the searchers and was there next morning when they came; Lyons was present but not Welch; they asked Lyons what was her illness? she said she had been ill a good while, but she did not know what was the matter with her: she took off her cap, but did not shew the cut - I went home soon after. Welsh did not ask me to the funeral, but I went to walk after it; she was going to be buried on the Sunday; I went there on Sunday and saw the body in the coffin, the prisoners were present - Kennedy, who was there went to the body, put his finger on the cut, and said it should not be buried that day - Welch said, he had no business to prevent his burying his wife, Kennedy fetched the beadle. When I saw the deceased on the Tuesday, she was speechless.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. They had lived very happy together? A. Yes; her maiden name was Mary Connell: it is not the custom in Ireland to bury married women by their maiden names, that I know - they often use their maiden names after marriage. I believe she has had two children; she never complained to me of any particular suffering at their birth. When she said she was jealous of Lyons, I think she was flighty; they bury the day after the death happens in Ireland, but that is not observed here. I was not surprised at not being invited - it is common to follow without - she always went by the name of Welch in England.</p>

            . I live in Church-street, St. Giles's, and know Welch - he lodged with his wife at my house for twelve months; they lived happily together. Lyons came to lodge with them about March last; they lived with me in my room, in the same room as me; they all three slept in the same bed. I and my husband slept in a bed in the same room: they moved from my house to Turnstile; I called there on the Sunday before his wife died: she had come to see me about a fortnight before that, and appeared very ill, and was not in good spirits; I thought her wrong in her head. On the Sunday before she died I and my husband met Welch in Bloomsbury, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon - we knew she was ill, and he asked us to go and see her - we went: she was sitting up in bed, and appeared better than when I last saw her; she said she was better: I do not know whether Welch was present - he was not sober when he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150023"/>met us. Lyons let us in, and went up to the room with us. Mrs. Welch said somebody had stolen her gown and cloak, and if I would send my girl with some of my clothes she would come and see me next day - she had told me when she was out of her mind that she was jealous of Nell Lyons and her husband - they were both present then. She said on Sunday that she had something to tell me - she did not appear very steady then. I left her about six o'clock that afternoon - Welch and Lyons were then in the room; she did not complain of any injury then. On the Tuesday following, which was the 28th of June, Welch called on me, about eleven o'clock that morning, and said his wife was very ill, and that he had brought the clergyman to prepare her; he asked me to go and see her. I and Donovan went between one and two o'clock - she was then in bed, and speechless; Lyons was in the room: Donovan told me to lift her up on the holster; I felt a handkerchief or something about her head; I asked Lyons what it was - sh said it was a handkerchief about her head, because her head had been light; she said nothing about any cut or accident then. On Friday, the 1st of July, Welch came to me, and said his wife was almost dead - in consequence of which I went about twelve o'clock, and found her very bad; she could not be worse: both the prisoners were there. She opened her eyes, and looked at me, but neither spoke or moved. I was there when she died between one and two o'clock - Welch was not then in the room; I sent for him - he came. I think he then had on a fustian jacket, and was in his working dress. I told him his wife was dead, and I wished Mrs. Donovan to be present when I washed the body - he said I could do it myself; Lyons was in the room: Donovan came up in the mean time, and helped me to wash the body. Donovan found out a cut - Welch had told me before that he was tipsy on the Sunday night, and was stretched on the bed - that she went down stairs, and Lyons called to him; he went down after her, and caught her by the body to bring her up - that she put her foot against the stairs, and fell back, with her head against the tiles, and so got that injury on the head.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Donovan point out a spot of blood on the deceased's neck? A. Yes, and on the bolster - it was a mark of blood; Lyons said Mrs. Welch had purged that blood out of her mouth. I saw some tiles on the stair-case on Tuesday - I do not know whether any were broken. - Lyons's hand was on the back of the deceased's head when we were washing the body. I wanted to wash her face - Donovan told me to turn the body to wash her neck; Lyons said there was no occasion for that. Donovan turned the body on the side, and found the cut. Before that it lay on its back. Donovan called out that the woman was murdered, and immediately fainted in a chair. I saw the cut very plain; there was blood about it: Donovan cut off some of the hair - it was bloody. I said I would do no more till the searchers were sent for. Donovan and I went for them - they did not come till eleven o'clock next day (Friday) - he was at work. I was in the room on Sunday, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon. Kennedy prevented the funeral.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know from Welch or Lyons that she had met with an accident, till you discovered it on Friday? A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Welch was an affectionate husband? A. Yes. I had every opportunity of observing his conduct - he was a good kind husband - he always spoke feelingly of her, and when she died he did the same - Poor women in Ireland go by their maiden names after marriage. I was with her about six months ago, when she had a dead child - she was very delicate; no violence was used to produce the birth: she was very ill afterwards. I know of nothing that caused her illness; her conduct was not such as to need control.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. Did she always go by the name of Welch? A. Yes. I saw her four or five times after she left Church-street - she had not lost her senses before she left me.</p>

            . On Sunday, the 26th of June, between three and four o'clock, I was in Welch's company - he was in liquor, but not very drunk; he came into Corkery's room, where I was, and asked me to go out and take a pot of beer; I went with him - we drank together. I asked how his wife was - he said she was very bad, and asked me to go and see her; we met Mrs. Corkery, and all went together - she was in bed; we got there between five and six o'clock, I think; she was very ill indeed. I saw Lyons there; Welch came away with me - he said that they three, meaning himself, wife, and Lyons, were sleeping in one bed, and that he thought Lyons was with child - I did not ask him by whom; I partly judged it was by him, from their sleeping together. I was there on Saturday at the wake - the prisoners and a woman were there. Welch told me that he and she were walking down stairs, and she was very drunk, fell, and was hurt; I think this was before she died, but cannot say - I think it was at the wake.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Welch did not say she was with child by him? A. No. He did not mention about her falling till Saturday. I was not with him above five minutes on Monday.</p>

            . I am a journeyman carpenter, and work for Mr. Thomas, with Welch, who lived in this house, which Mr. Thomas was repairing: he lived there with his sister, as he called his wife; and Lyons staid there with them. On Tuesday, the 28th of January, he came into the shop to me and asked if I should be afraid to go and see a sick person - I said no - I went up stairs with him to the top room, and there saw the woman whom he had described as his sister, laying on her back in bed. I should have thought at first that she was dead: he took hold of her left hand, which was closed, and pulled it open - it closed again of itself, which satisfied me she was not dead; I asked if he had any medical assistance - he said Mr. Thomas's doctor had attended her - he had told me, on a former occasion, that Mr. Thomas had let him have money, with which he had sent his wife to Ireland - he gave me no account of her illness - Mr. Thomas came to the house that morning - I told him I had been up by Welsh's desire; I afterwards saw Welch, and said I had told Mr. Thomas about his wife being ill - he said he had mentioned it himself, and he thought his master would call and see her: the house was under repair, and there were tiles at the foot of the stairs. On the Friday morning master's apprentice brought a basket for Welch to take somewhere, and while the apprentice was talking to me Lyons came down, and said, "Go and fetch Welch, for she is gone." I supposed by that she was dead; the apprentice went - Welch came soon after and went up immediately, and in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150024"/>about half an hour I heard a noise, which I supposed to be in their room - Welch came down afterwards, and I questioned him what the noise was up stairs - he said they had found a scratch on her pate, and the people up-stairs were talking of sending for a beadle - that he was searching about and the people asked him what he was looking for, and he said for a paper, which contained flour, which he had got to stop the blood; he told me that day, that on the Sunday he got more to drink than usual, and had laid himself down on the bed - his cousin Lyons awoke him, and said she had put on his coat, and gone down stairs - that he went after her, and in bringing her up in his arms she put her foot on the third stair, and shoved them both backward - she fell against some tiles, which caused the scratch on her pate. I examined the tiles on the Thursday after her death, but could observe no blood on them, nor about the stairs - some were broken: he said his sister had spoken to him that very morning, and said she wished him to follow her to the grave as chief mourner, and to bury her in St. Giles's church-yard, as her husband was away, he was the only friend she had: I asked him if she was a married woman - he said yes, and had parted from her husband through some differences.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not know whether she was his wife or not? A. No; I used to ask Lyons of a morning how Welch's sister was. Some of the tiles might have been removed before I examined them.</p>

            . My uncle, Steward, keeps the Ship, wine vaults, in Little Turnstile. Welch had his beer from our house - Lyon lived with him and his sister, as I always called her. I went over for the pots, two or three times in the week she died - she was very ill when I saw her - I was there on the Thursday, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the day before her death - she was then sitting on something behind the door, and appeared very ill; I asked how she was - she answered me very faintly, "Very ill, indeed;" she was sitting alone; I observed no blood about her - Lyons was there - I met Welch that afternoon, and asked him if it was not his wife who was up stairs ill - he said no, that his wife was at Reading, very ill. A week before that I had occasion to go up to the room, the deceased was there alone - just as she was beginning to tell me something Lyon came in and the deceased said hush.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had said very little to her? A. No; she said she had something to mention and begged I would not mention it again. Welch has described her as his sister ever since he has been at the house.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Thomas. On the 1st of July Welch came to the house, I had met him on the Monday; he said he was going to ask his master's leave to go home as his sister was taken very ill after breakfast; that before breakfast she was quite well, and said to him "I think we may part with our cousin, as I am now quite recovered; when you can give her a trifle, I think you may let her go."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what happened to her after breakfast? A. He said it was one of her fits which she had been subject to; he had said she had scratched herself in her fits and hit herself, but did not say where; he told me on the following morning that he had had a doctor to her, but the doctor said it was too late for him, he could not save her - he came on Friday the 1st of July; he took a piece of paper out of his pocket, and asked me to give him some flour to stop the bleeding of the scratches - this was before twelve o'clock in the morning. I am sure he called them scratches, and in the course of the week he said there was a scratch about her temple, and the other on the cheek. I gave him about a tea-spoon full of flour, which he said would be enough; he never described her illness in any other way to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long before her death had he told you she was his sister? A. He always said so. I never heard her called Mrs. Welch.</p>

            . I am a painter, employed by Mr. Thomas, and work with Welch; he told me his wife was at Reading - this was while he lived in Turnstile; at another time he told me she was gone to Ireland, and when she returned he would give me some whiskey. I understood from him, that one of the women who lived with him was his sister, and the other his cousin; he came to me on Friday morning, the 1st of July, at Southampton-row, where I was working - I think it was between nine and ten o'clock in the morning - he was much agitated. I asked him to get me some turpentine; he said hastily, "Say nothing, oh! I am maddened! maddened! distressed and mad." I said, "What is the matter;" he said "She is gone," I said "What, your sister?" he said Yes; and seemed in a most agitated state; he put his hand to his head, as if he was in pain. I asked if he had a coffin for her, he said "No, master will see to that, he is very good to me."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he describe the manner of her dying? A. He said she was frightened, for she seemed to spring up in her bed, and look at him, and he could not bear to stand to see her; that she said in her illness, that no person should follow her but himself, and she wished to be buried in St. Giles's church-yard; that he would bury her on Sunday, and have her screwed down as soon as possible, for poor creature she would not keep - she was not fit to be seen.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he his working dress on that morning? A. He had a clean grey coat on, which I had never seen before; he usually wore a fustian or blue jacket - a circumstance occurred in my business, which makes me certain that this passed before eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How do you know that? A. I had a particular piece of work to do, and was to be at my master's house as soon as I finished it, and was there before eleven o'clock. He expressed sorrow and was crying a little.</p>

            . I am a builder. The prisoner was labourer to the carpenters. I had an empty house in Turnstile, and put him to live there to save his rent - he bore a very good character - he came to work for me in July, 1824. I then understood him to be married, and living with his wife. About Christmas he told me one of his children were scalded to death, which caused his wife to be seriously ill, and made her subject to fits; that the doctor said she must go into the country. I advanced him 2 l. to take her, and he told me she was gone - this was at the end of March; he went to Turnstile soon after Midsummer, and I understood from him that his sister and cousin lived with him there. On the Sunday after<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150025"/>her death, he was apprehended, and confessed to me then that she was his wife. On the Monday before that, I asked him how his sister was - he said very ill, and that last night she had received a slight accident - I asked him the nature of it, he said he had laid himself on his bed, and his cousin awoke him, and told him she had gone down stairs, he followed her, and got to her just before she got to the street door, took her round the waist, and was carrying her up; when they got about the fourth or fifth step, she put out her feet, and by a sudden spring threw them both down - that she struck her feet against the sash, and bounded over the bannisters, and fell on some stones at the bottom. I am sure he said sash, and I think stones or tiles. I asked if she had hurt herself; he said she had a slight scratch on the head, pointing his finger to his head; he wished me particularly to go and see her, but I did not. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of the day she died. I saw him in my yard; he said his sister was gone at last, and that she would have gone half an hour before, but she had waited to see him, to give directions about her funeral; that she wished to be buried very plain, and only him to follow. I saw him again that evening; he said, now his sister was gone, he must see about a lodging, and what was he to do about the bedstead, meaning one I had given him. I said "Sleep on it to be sure;" he said he would not sleep on it again for 50 l. Mr. Blair is my doctor - I never sent him to attend her.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not you object to sleep on the bed on which a person had died? A. I told him I should not mind it, but I know he was rather timid.</p>

            . I keep the Black Horse public-house. The witness Donovan is my sister. On Sunday, in consequence of what she said, I went to the house where the deceased lay. I found the corpse in the coffin - they were going to bury it - the room was full of people. I said I should look at the body. I pushed the coffin lid aside - Lyons was in the room but not Welch. I lifted up the head, and my hand sunk into a large cut in the back, cap and all, and when I took my hand out it was quite bloody - I shewed it to the people, and forbid the funeral. Welch came into the room - I asked how that happened; he at first said I had no occasion to interfere with his wife, what was his wife to me. I said there was visibly something wrong - he said, what was that to me. I forbid the undertaker to bury: he said he would if the husband ordered him. Welch said, she slipped down at the bottom step of the stairs. I went with the beadle next morning, and examined the stairs carefully, but could not find the least appearance of blood. I looked at the sacking of the bed on Monday - it was stained with blood, and had some flour over it - there was blood on the bed and bolster, and on the boards of the room - the bolster was very bloody; there was an appearance of flour on the bed, but not on the bolster; a cap was very bloody, also a jacket had blood on the sleeve.</p>

            . I am a beadle. On Sunday, the 3d of July, I went to this house. I told Welch we had heard the woman was murdered, and I must stop the funeral, and take him into custody. I said the corpse should not be taken out of the house till it was examined by a medical gentleman; his master came afterwards. I examined the body; Lyons was present when I discovered the wound. I took Welch to the watch-house; he told me she had fallen down stairs. At the watch-house I asked why he had not sent for a doctor. He said, "I don't know what is the reason, but I did not do it." I afterwards took Lyons. I examined the stair-case minutely, but found no marks of blood there; there was blood under the bed, and a large quantity in the centre of the bed; the blood mark on the floor was exactly under that, and the sacking was also stained with blood; the floor appeared to have been washed to get out the blood, and there was flour on the floor; the stain on the bolster, had nothing to do with the other part of the bed. I found a jacket between the bolster and ticking - the back of it was stained with blood; there was none on the sleeves; there were two caps and a handkerchief stained all over with blood, and an old cloth in the cupboard was stained with blood; it appeared to have been used as an apron; I found it in the cupboard, with shavings on the top of it; I found an old hatchet in the cellar of the house, and an iron hammer under the shavings with the cloth; there was no blood on them; I produce the cloth, sacking, &amp;c.</p>

I have no recollection of attending his wife; if I had I should have remembered it. He never called on me to attend her. I have attended several of Mr. Thomas's men. I remember his speaking to me of a woman having received an injury on the head, but he did not request me to attend her, and I did not.</p>

There was a wound on the back of the head, about two inches long, it appeared a recent wound. I examined it more particularly the same evening with Mr. Paty. There was an extensive fracture of the skull, which commenced at the left ear, and extended right across the head, and terminated in the base of the skull, on the opposite side; a small branch of the same fracture extended backward; this fracture was in addition to the wound. The wound appeared a clean incision, as if cut with a sharp instrument. I think this axe could have inflicted it. A fall down three or four stairs could not have done it. A blow with the axe, if given with force, would have caused the fracture. It did not come in contact with the brain. There was an artery of the membrane of the brain ruptured by the bone, which was driven in. There had been an effusion of about four ounces of blood from the artery. I found it between the skull and dura mater.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150026"/>Q. Could you judge how long before death these wounds had been inflicted? A. I do not think the wound could have been inflicted more than twenty-four hours before death; I think so from the appearance of the wound; the injury of the head altogether was the cause of her death. I opened the body; there was no appearance of disease elsewhere, except a disorder of the bowels, but not such as to cause death; blood must have flowed from the wound immediately it was inflicted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the wound could not be caused by a fall down three or four steps; would not that depend on the nature of what the head came in contact with? A. That would make a difference.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If she had fallen down the whole stair-case would that have caused the wound? A. If she had fallen on any thing sharp; the edge of a common tile could not have caused it; a sharp slate tile would.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Might not the fracture have been caused by falling against the post of a bed? A. No; a fall from a great height might do it certainly; the membrane was naturally very strong.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK. Q. From the appearance of the wound, could it have been inflicted by a fall on the Sunday before death? A. I think not. I have it proved by a witness that she was seen sitting up without assistance. In my judgment the injury must have happened after that.</p>

            . I have heard Mr. Tweddale examined. I assisted him in dissecting the body. I differ from him in one respect. I think it possible for a woman to have had intervals of sensibility - that she might have sat up and talked - but it entirely depends upon whether the blood effused slowly or quickly, and I think there must have been two blows or falls to have inflicted the incised wound and fracture.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Could you, from external appearances, judge that there had been more than one blow? A. Yes; the incised wound was a clean cut, and on introducing my finger I did not find the fracture corresponding - it was two inches beyond it, from which I conclude there must have been two blows. I think the fracture might have existed on the Sunday, but not the incision.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at any part of the skull, where you saw the mark of a bruise where the fracture had been made? A. The extravasation of blood had taken place, and there was some external appearances of a blow corresponding with the fracture; the fracture of itself was sufficient to cause death; the incised wound was not sufficient I think.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If any other partner had occasion to sleep in town, he would sleep there? A. No; the house is made over to me in the articles of partnership - none of the trade servants sleep there; one of the partners may have slept there once within the last ten years, but it was by invitation; they have no right to sleep there. I remember Mr. James Randall sleeping there, when I invited him to dinner.</p>

            . I live at No. 6, Queenhithe, with my mother. On the 6th of July, I saw all the three prisoners pass my mother's door; the house is two or three yards from the corner which turns round to where the prosecutor's house is; it was six o'clock in the evening as near as I can judge: I saw them pass the door where I stood; one of them had a chest of tea on his back; that was Frederick Williams (pointing him out,); they came in a direction from the prosecutor's house; I followed them to Mr. Riley's, the Blue Last public-house, Distaff-lane, and saw Frederick and Henry go into the house; Frederick still had the chest, and Henry carried his hat; Michael crossed the road, and I directly went and gave information to Jackson, the officer, who lives close by; before I came out of Jackson's, Michael and Frederick were gone; Henry ran a little distance and was taken. Mrs. Coesar, who lives two doors from me, came out and joined me in the pursuit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know any of their names before that day? A. Yes, I knew the Christian names; Henry and Frederick went into the public-house; I do not know whether they are related - when I came from the officer's, Henry stood opposite to the public-house - the other two had gone away; Henry had come out of the public-house and stood opposite. I swear that he was with them carrying Frederick's hat in his hand - the public-house is about as far as from here to St. Paul's church-yard; I get my living by servitude; I had just left my place; I knew them all personally.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had no quarrel with Frederick? A. No, no quarrel - if he chose to abuse me I could not help it; I do not think such characters worth quarrelling with - he has abused me several times, but I never quarrelled with him; I did not answer him.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you get your living, when out of service? A. I was with my mother who keeps a mangle.</p>
               <p>Q. The words you had were entirely on the prisoner's side - were they before this charge? A. Yes; I was not at all angry; after I left my situation, I thought no more about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you leave in consequence of the dispute? A. I left when I found what characters frequented the house; it was at Mr. Dyson's, a public-house; I took the place not knowing what a set used the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a little chastity quarrel? A. He thought proper to abuse me; I thought it best not to answer him; I took no notice of him - it happened twice.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after that did you discover the tea on his back? A. I believe it was three months after - I frequently saw him in the day time. I do not now know what he quarrelled with me about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Do you know Michael? A. I know them all by serving them with liquor at the bar, nothing more; there was nothing to hinder Michael from going into the public-house, except that I think he saw me - he saw me going and might suspect that I was going for the officers, and he could beckon the others out, which he did, and they came out.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not full time to go into the house? A. Yes, if he chose; I brought the officer in about a minute after I saw them go into the public-house - the one who carried the hat had the same opportunity of seeing me as Michael, but the one with the chest had not; I told Coesar of it before I went to the officer; she lives next door to me; I told her of it as I passed her door behind them; she and I followed them to the public-house, and then I went to the officer; they could have heard me acquaint her, and I have no doubt but they did, for two of them looked back, the one with the chest could not look back - they went into the public-house after I called her.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to Coesar? A. As I was standing at the door seeing the men pass, I gave the alarm, having known them before. I said to Coesar that I thought those men who had gone on with that chest, had not got it honestly, and we followed them: Coesar was in her front room - she could see them pass; she heard me speaking, and came out; I directly told her and we followed them - I spoke loud enough for her to hear me in her parlour - I do not know whether she heard the words, but she heard me speaking; the prisoners heard me - I have no doubt every one in the street must have heard me - no one was passing at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were you speaking to then? A. I stood at the door and said so - my mother's is next door but one to Coesar's - the men had just turned the corner - the place was so public they could not get rid of the chest without going into the public-house - for though no one was in our street, they turned into Fish-street, and there are all shops there. Coesar is a married woman - my mother and her's live in one house, and she herself keeps the house next door but one, but her mother lives in my mother's house; Coesar's husband lives with her and was at home, but did not come out. I am acquainted with Coesar, she did not know the prisoners before, that I know of - she never told me she was acquainted with them or any of them - when I called, she said we will follow them and see where they take it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did not you at the time let Coesar know that they were the William's? A. I mentioned their names to her at the time - she did not give me to understand that she knew who they were before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say that you saw Michael speak to the other two persons? A. I saw him beckon them out - I might not have told the Magistrate so - I do not recollect whether I mentioned it or not - I never saw either of them speaking to Coesar - I told her they were men whom I had served many times with liquor - I do not know now that she was acquainted with either of them.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. You have no doubt of their persons? A. Not the least; Coesar took notice of them.</p>

            . I know the last witness, and live two doors from her. My husband is a lighterman. On the 6th of July, about six o'clock in the evening, we saw three men come by the door with a chest of tea - I was sitting in my own house at tea - Ketling came up as far as our door - I was coming out and asked her if she knew where those men had got that tea - she mentioned all three of their names - I did not know them - she said she did not know where they got it; I said "We will follow them to see where they take it;" we did so - they went up Bread-street-hill, when the short one (Michael) parted from the others and went up the church-yard - he had his arm in a sling - I was not acquainted with him; the other<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150028"/>two went up the hill, and turned up Fish-street - one carrying the hat and the other the tea - they went to the Blue Last and beckoned to the other prisoners, who joined them again, and the two went into the Blue Last; the short one stood on the opposite side - he crossed once and beckoned the two others out - they had not then been there more than three minutes; I was standing at the corner of Distaff-lane - he crossed the way on the same side as the Blue Lasts - the other, who I supposed to be the man who carried the tea, came out without it, but his apron, which he had on before, was off, and the other one came out - the one who carried the tea walked away without turning his face to me; the other one, when he came out walked about the door, and wiped his face - the other two walked away; the second one who came out, staid till the last witness went to Jackson; I remained at the corner - she came back with Jackson; he then crossed over and walked swiftly away, and I saw Jackson running, and then he ran and stopped short, by the pump; he returned back, and appeared to ask the mob what was the matter - I said "that is the man," and he was taken - he was the one who carried the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Which was the man who remained behind? A. That is him, Henry - he carried the hat - I first heard his name was Henry when he passed the door. I had no acquaintance with any of them before - I swear that.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you when you first heard of this? A. Sitting in my own place. I saw them pass my door - I live close up in the corner; Henry was coming towards us when he was taken - Jackson was with us - I said "That is one of them;" there might be more persons call out besides me, as a good many people had assembled by that time; I do not know whether the last witness called out that he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where do you live? A. At No. 8, Naked Boy-alley. Ketling's house is not in the alley - I live two doors from her; I was at tea in a lower room adjoining the street - I came to the door, seeing a genteel dressed man run up the place with a hat in his hand, as if to see if it was a thoroughfare - my husband was at tea with me, and saw me go out - he did not leave the table.</p>
               <p>Q. You were astonished at seeing the man pass? A. No, not till I saw the tea chest pass, I then came out - I did not tell my husband why I went. It was more than half an hour before I returned - he was not there when I came back. When I got out I first saw Henry, who carried the hat, then the one with the tea - I do not know his name; I then saw the other with his arm in a sling, and an umbrella in his hand. I never saw either of them before to my knowledge - I did not know the one who had his arm in a sling.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, for fear of a mistake, his name is Michael - do you persist in saying you never saw him before that night? A. Not to my knowledge. When I came to the door Ketling came up - she had got to my door at the time - I had not heard her saying any thing - it was not her voice that brought me out - the first thing I said to her was to ask if she knew where the tea came from; I do not think that she spoke to me first; she said she did not know, but she knew the three persons who were carrying it, and mentioned all their three names directly - I said "We will follow and see where they go." I knew Ketling by her living in an apartment two doors from me - her mother, whose name is Johnson, lives there, and my mother also lives in the same house; it might be ten minutes after I came out before Michael went away. The officer lives close by.</p>

            . I keep the Blue Lasts, Distaff-lane. On the 6th of July, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner Henry came to my house - I do not know either of the others - he came with another who I cannot speak to - I was at tea in the bar - something came lumping into the passage, I looked, and it was a chest of tea - they had a glass of gin each at the bar, and did not remain more than five minues - only while they drank it - they went out, leaving this chest of tea behind.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did any body else come to your house about the same time. A. Not a creature came to the bar but them. Jackson apprehended Henry and brought him by my house - he asked if I knew him - I said he was the person - he denied it; Jackson took him away with the tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Which carried the tea you do not know? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the other man give Henry a glass of gin, saying it was for his trouble in carrying the load? A. I heard nothing of the sort - each drank a glass and went away; Henry did not go out till there was a noise about the tea - he then walked off about twenty paces, and then ran. I went to the door.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Could you see whether either of the two had his arm in a sling? A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL BUDD. I was in Distaff-lane on the evening of the 6th of July, and saw Jackson. I saw the prisoner Henry standing at the door of the Blue Last, public-house; he walked from the door, and afterwards ran away into Friday-street; I ran after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. He was doing nothing? A. He was walking alongside another who was carrying a chest of tea. I saw the tea go out of their hands into the door of the public-house - he took it off the man's shoulder, and helped him to pitch it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the other invite him to take a glass of gin for his trouble? A. No. I saw him go to the bar.</p>

            , and live in Benbow's-rent. I have known Henry Williams eight years, as a boot and shoe-maker. The witness Ketling was in my room on the 4th of May; I know she had quarrelled with the prisoner Frederick: she said she would have her revenge on him, and should like to see him hung, and if she had her will she would hang him, for revenge was sweet - she said that three or four times in my room.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you to recollect that it was the 4th of May? A. Because it was exactly a month before my child died, which was on the 4th of June. I told Frederick's wife of this, and was subpoened here.</p>

I was then taken back a few yards, and the handkerchief was on the ground.</p>

Yes; I had been drinking a little more than usual, and had gone to bed to make me better. I had had four glasses of sherry, and my beer, that was all. I asked the prisoner next day how much I had paid him, but it was merely to find out where I had lost the money - he had not been many weeks with me.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer. I was at the pay table, and sat on the left hand of Jordan. I saw him lay down two sovereigns, the prisoner took them up in five or six minutes, and put them into his pocket; he then came and sat down on the left hand of me at the lower end of the room. Mr. Jordan afterwards said to me, "Have I done paying;" I said, "I don't know indeed;" he then looked round, and said "O there is Adcock, I have not paid him;" he then paid him 1 l. 5 s.; the prisoner then got up and said "Who is clerk?" I said "There is no clerk;" he then laid down 6 d. and went away. I did not know but what the sovereigns had been his own, as he was task master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Jordan appear to be sober? A. I cannot upon my oath say he was sober. I never had any difference with the prisoner about a plumb-bob. I said it was in the building. I never said I would be up with him. I was present when he was asked to compromise this business the next morning, but he said No.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JORDAN re-examined. Q. Did you offer to compromise the matter with him the next morning? A. Yes; I said if he would return them, or confess that he took them, I would compromise the matter, but he said he knew nothing about them. I told him that Simpson and Inwood saw him take them; he said "I believe Simpson and Inwood had the money;" and Simpson said "If you don't prosecute him I will."</p>

            . I am a carter. I was at the pay-table, and received my money that night. I saw the prisoner take up the two sovereigns into his hand - I did not see what he did with them. I staid there some time, and saw him afterwards receive his wages. I did not say anything about what I had seen, because I did not know whether they were his right or not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not Jordan pay all that was paid at that table? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not appear very odd that Adcock should take the money from off the table? A. I did not know anything about the business. I told Mr. Jordan after he had done paying the men, that I had noticed three payments; he had paid three sovereigns to a carpenter, and two sovereigns to a plasterer; that I saw Adcock take the two sovereigns from the table, and that after that he had paid him 1 l. 5 s. I did not hear him say "O there is Adcock, I have not paid him." I was present on the Monday morning, but I did not hear the prisoner say "I am innocent, if any one took the money, it was you or Simpson." I did not hear Simpson say "If Mr. Jordon does not prosecute you, I will, for saying that," - it was not said in my presence. I heard Mr. Jordan say, that if he confessed he had taken the money, he would take it any way, and let him go free; they were together after I was there, and I dare say Adcock was at large all that day.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Where did the prosecutor sit, at the table? A. About the middle. Adcock was not sitting at all when he took the two sovereigns - he was standing opposite to Mr. Jordan. I was next but one to Mr. Jordan on his right hand, and Simpson was next to him on his left - it was a long table about ten feet long.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell Mr. Jordan that Adcock had taken the two sovereigns? A. Because I did not know but it was his right.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM JORDAN re-examined. Q. Where did you sit at the table? A. On one side of it, and the men were in different directions about me. Adcock stood before me, and I said "There's the man I like, because he has been at work this week." I had taken four sovereigns out of my pocket, and had to pay a plasterer 3 l., and I said "Perhaps a pound's worth of silver would be of use to you?" I gave him two sovereigns and a pound in silver, and laid down the other two sovereigns on the table close by my right hand. I cannot recollect who sat next to me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What time was the compromise offered to him? A. On the Monday morning about six or seven o'clock - it might be later - I cannot tell exactly; he went to work on the following morning.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM SIMPSON re-examined. Q. What sort of a table was it you were at? A. It was a long table - Mr. Jordan sat on one side of it. I was next to him on his left hand, and the prisoner stood opposite him when he took the sovereigns, and then he went and sat at the end. I saw Jordan put down the sovereigns nearer to the prisoner than to himself. At the time he laid down the money, he said, "That is the man I like;" the prisoner took up the money.</p>

            . I lived at Mrs. Brittle's. On Sunday morning, the 14th of August, I was in the backyard about twenty minutes past one o'clock. I saw a man come down stairs with a collar in his left hand, and a flute in his right. Schwartz followed him down stairs, and Sanders came after him with a bag of harness, which I saw at the mouth of the bag. Schwartz took the bag, and went away with the man who had the collar.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you lived there? A. About three years. I had no quarrel with Sanders. I have always said the mouth of the bag was open. I get my living by mending a few shoes, or selling fruit at the market.</p>

            . I am an officer. I heard of this on Sunday evening, and from the description of the persons, I went to the prisoners' lodgings on Monday morning, between three and four oclock. I found Sanders on the bed with a woman - he had his clothes on, and two women and another man were in another bed - I took them all to the office, and they were examined. When I went in, this piece of wax candle was burning. I found this looking-glass, these keys, a vice, a file, and some other tools, and phosphorus box without a cork. I afterwards had this cork given to me by the servant, it fits the box exactly. On Sanders I found this handkerchief round his neck, a broken padlock, and this book, which Rawlinson claims; about ten o'clock that morning, Schwartz came to him with a mug of tea, and I took him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How many persons were there in the room? A. Two men and three women; I saw a young woman named Webster there - she did not tell me then that these articles did not belong to them, but she has said so since.</p>
               <p>THOMAS RAWLINSON re-examined. Q. Can you swear to these candles? A. No; but I left some candles of this description in the lamps on the Saturday night - this glass and neckcloth are my own - I have not seen the harness nor the lamps since.</p>
               <p>JOHN CONRAD HOPKE. I heard of this on the Sunday morning - this handkerchief is one of twelve which I gave to my servant; I believe the mark has been picked out out of it.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave Schwartz a good character.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to search the prisoner's lodging - I found him and his mother there; I asked if he had robbed his master, he said he had not: I found three keys on him, and this cane was in a drawer - he said, a boy who had lived at Mr. Robinson's before him, gave it to him - and his mother said he had brought it home a long time before and given it to his father. I then asked if they had any other rooms; she said they had a room up stairs - I went up and saw a box which the prisoner said had been his at Mr. Robinson's - he unlocked it, and I found in it some duplicates, which he said related to his own property.</p>

I went on Monday morning, and gave what description I could of their dress, but I had not seen their faces. I could not swear that the prisoner is the man who had the top boots on, but he is like him.</p>

            . I am a waterman. I was standing at my own door, No. 5, Providence-street, Commercial-road, on Saturday week; the prisoner came by with three or four birds in a cage, one of them was a goldfinch; I bought one of the canary birds of him, for 2 s. 6 d.</p>

I said I would give him 1 l. for them, but he would not take it. I then borrowed 1 s. of a lodger to pay the money.</p>

            , a coachman. I have heard what the last witness has stated - it is true - I lent the prisoner 1 s.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you come down? A. Yes, and saw the prisoner give the money, and also saw the man give him the three canaries, the goldfinch, the cage, and the boots; he is a dealer - he buys clothes for his mother, and brother in the country. I did not see him try the boots on.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a man was it who sold them? A. He was a shortish man with a fustian jacket and velveteen trousers. The prisoner owns the house, and I have lodged there about two months. My husband is a groom, but generally follows the coach business. On the Saturday night the prisoner came home soon, and went to bed, as far as I can recollect, about ten o'clock, and was in bed at half-past seven the next morning. He occupies the two parlours and the kitchen. I believe the birds all died on the Saturday - he has borrowed money of me several times.</p>
               <p>CHARLES STEVENS. I have heard what my wife has stated - it is true - I saw all this transaction - the man had a fustian jacket on, but I do not know what trousers - I am not aware whether the prisoner has any top boots or not.</p>
               <p>ELIZABETH PERRING re-examined. Q. Are you a regular servant to the prisoner? A. Yes; I saw the bargain - it was a man with a fustian jacket on - I never saw my master make a bargain before - he does sometimes wear top boots.</p>

The prisoner came to our house, to hire lodgings, on the 14th of July - she was to give me two guineas and a half a week, and to take them for herself, her husband, and her brother, who was a foreigner; she came the next day, and desired me to get her a dinner and some wine, and then tea, which I did - she said she would pay me the next morning, as she had only a 5 l. Marlborough note, and a 35 l. cheque - she then desired me to get her some more tea and sugar, and asked me to lend her a sovereign, which I did not do. While I went out in the evening she went away - she had locked the drawers, and taken the keys - she had not put the tea in the caddy, but had taken it away, with a napkin which I had lent her. I do not know whether the napkin was to be considered as part of the furniture.</p>

            . I am a broker. I sold this truck to Mr. Barnett - I bought it of the prisoner near the beginning of the year - he brought it to my door while I was out - he then offered it to a number of persons, and they brought him to me; thinking he had not got it fairly, we took him to the Magistrate, who committed him - but they could not find an owner; after he had been in custody for a fortnight, he came to me again, and I bought it of him - it was not long after the beginning of the year; I bought it for 11 s. and sold it for 30 s.</p>

            . I am a broker. About five or six months ago, the prisoner offered to sell me two or three trucks; I knew Barnett had bought some trucks of him, and I said to Mr. Gold "We may get into trouble, for I don't think he gets them honestly." I did not buy the first he brought, but he brought one a week or two ago - I then went to my next door neighbour, and we followed him, and when he got to Mitchell-street, I saw him offering<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150035"/>it to another broker; I took hold of it and said "You are in a great hurry to sell this - whose is it?" he said it was his own; I then said "Did you not sell a truck to Mr. Gold?" I then took him to Mr. Gold, and said "Is this the man?" he said "He is;" I then asked the prisoner where he lived; he said in Great or Little Cutler's-street; - we went there and found it was so. Gold fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>The prisoner put in a written defence, stating, that he had bought the truck in Smithfield.</p>

            . I have worked with the prisoner. - On the 19th of August I was walking up Plough-yard, and saw him come out of Mr. Gardener's warehouse, with a bag on his back, similar to this. There was another man with him, who is in Mr. Gardener's employ. The prisoner went up King's Head-court; the other man locked the door, and went the contrary way; the prisoner went towards Red Lion-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not say you thought the bag contained shoes? A. Yes, I did, because they are allowed to be taken away by Mr. Gardener.</p>

I found him in Harley Mews. I asked if he had not slept at the Black Horse the last night; he said No; he had just come from the country. I said he certainly was the man - he said No, I was mistaken. I took him to the landlord, and asked him if that was not the person - he said it was; he still denied it - the landlord said he would send for a constable; the prisoner then took off his hat and gave the shirt out, and said "Now you have got your property, I hope you will let me go." I said I had lost a pair of stockings - he said he had not got them; he shewed something out of his pockets, and said that was all he had got, but I saw there was something in his breast pocket. I tapped on that pocket, and said, "What is in there;" he then took out a pair of stockings, and said "Now you have got all your property, let me go, I did it through distress."</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had a shirt which I brought from Woolwich and Greenwich in my hat. I met an old mate, and we had some grog - to the best of my knowledge my own shirt was in my hat when I slept at the house. I do not know of any one having changed the shirt, and I thought it was my own. I had plenty of time to have been miles off, or to have disposed of it in different ways. I had been suffering some months with a rheumatic fever, and the reason I gave up the article was, that rather than be locked up in a prison, or a watch-house, which I never was, I would have given up every thing.</p>

            . I took the prisoner into custody on the 6th of August, and found the truck at Neeres's door; I asked the prisoner how he got it - he said, his father died about six months before and left it to him; I then went with him to his lodgings - the woman there said that she gave him leave to put a truck in there the night before, but she did not know whose it was; I then made him draw the truck to a cooper's, and we put it up there and went to the Magistrate's - he was committed for a week; I afterwards saw written in pencil in front of the truck, "Bates, Borough;" and by that means I found the owner; I shewed it to Bates, who claimed it.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BATES re-examined. Q. Did you see your truck before the Magistrates? A. Yes, I knew it to be mine, because I made it myself; I had seen the pencil mark on it when it was in my possession, but do not know who wrote it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought it on Friday in Smithfield, for 25 s. I had the address of the man of whom I bought it, but since I have been apprehended he has gone away.</p>

               <p>Q. When he took the keys, did he not say, I will see which I like best, and I will pay you for it. A. Yes, he took the keys out of the shop - he did not say he would see which would do and return the other; he took them up in a very curious manner - I asked him if he was going to pay for them; he said, "Oh dear, no! I am going to look at the watches in the window."</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the old watch? A. He took it off the counter again.</p>

He came about five or six times to pay the money; I never saw him any where else to my knowledge; I believe I charged him 30 s. or 35 s. for the old watch. I kept the property till the payments were made.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Does it stand to reason that I should go and purchase the watch for 2 l. 11 s., and then wish to exchange? I asked what he would charge for mending it, and he said 4 s. 6 d.; I said, it was a great deal; I then asked him if he would make an exchange; and he said he would - I looked at one at 3 l. 18 s.; I thought it too much - I then asked to look at some watch keys: he shewed me some which I did not like - I then looked at some more, but it was not likely, that I should take two keys out of a shop.</p>

I saw the prisoner and another person in a garden adjoining the prosecutor's - one of them had a bundle in his arm, but I am not certain which; for as soon as they saw me they both ran off - they left the bundle in Mr. Saul's garden - I saw the prisoner's back, so as to know him again - they got over a fence and a gate - the other got over it, but the prisoner broke it down - I was not then above three feet from him - I had kept my eye on him from the first moment I saw him till he got to the gate, except in going round a corner - I opened a gate which led into East-street, and saw him running very fast - Adams stopped him - we took him to the watch-house, and I took the watchman to the place where I first saw him, where we found the bundle which is here produced - it appeared to be the same which I had seen the man first carrying.</p>

Shortly after I heard a bell ring in the back kitchen - I went to answer the bell, and saw the prisoner with six other men - I was ordered to fetch a pot of half-and-half - when I took that in I saw the prisoner take up an empty basket, and go out - his companions asked him why he did not stay - he said he would be back presently - he afterwards came to me at the bar for some paper, which he said Mrs. Lea sent him for - I afterwards saw him near the skittle-ground, with the basket in his hand.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home, and intended to settle the account with master, but he was out. I tendered my mistress the money, which she took, and then returned it, and desired me to keep it till I saw my master. I went out to get some refreshment, and with the labour of the night, and the heat of the day, I fell asleep. When I awoke I missed the money, and did not like to go back without it.</p>

I am sure the prisoner is the man who knocked me down - he was a stranger to me; when the other man ran away I picked up my cap, and ran after the prisoner; as both ran away; I called "Stop thief!" but nobody stopped him; I caught him myself, and he knocked me down twice after that - I had the marks on me for weeks after; I secured him at last, and gave him to an officer. I have not recovered my money.</p>

Yes - I had 2 l. in my pocket when I left the Docks at two o'clock - I received 1 l. from my master that morning. I had not drank much - I called at the Brown Bear, and had four or five pots of beer among three or four of my shipmates, and some spirits - we were there from two till near six o'clock - it was close by the London-dock gate - Marsh and Smith were with me - I left John Cane at the Brown Bear - I went to no other house. I saw the prisoner knock my hat off, and saw him take the money - I was capable of running after him - I caught him in the alley - I did not meet him - I followed and took him, without losing sight of him - he was not more than two rods from me.</p>

While we were talking together, the prisoner came up the the court, knocked her down, and kicked her - I did not hear her say a word - she had her hand in her pocket to give some money to my child to get the victuals from the bakehouse; and he knocked her down with his fist, and kicked her with his legs several times while she was down - he kicked her in several parts about her body, side, and thighs; persons began to collect, and as soon as she recovered herself, she got up and ran into a chandler's shop at the corner of the court; he dragged her out by the hair of her head and her handkerchief, knocked her down again, and jumped upon her twice - the mob collected, and I saw no more - whether he dragged her down the court or what I cannot say. I stood at the top of the court, and said</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect his complaining of her not getting the supper? A. No; she was giving my girl the money to pay the baker, when he came up. I did not hear him speak to her, nor she to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did she not say to him "You may kiss my head?" A. Oh dear No. He kicked her, the first time he knocked her down. I was perfectly sober, and she seemed quite sensible.</p>

            . My husband is a chimney-sweeper. I was in White Hart-court, and saw Sullivan run into the chandler's-shop after his wife - he kicked her in the shop, and pulled her out by her hair, drew her down the steps by her hair, then pulled her all along the court, and dashed her in-doors like a dog, into the room where they live. I did not see him strike her till he got her in; he then fastened the door, and broke the chair all to pieces over her - he was beating her with the chair till he broke it; he struck her eight or nine times with the chair - it was not a heavy one - every body was afraid to go near him; she was laying down all this time, and all her senses were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you see all this? A. I followed him and said "Con govern your passion;" he said "I will serve you the same." I peeped through the key-hole of the room-door, and saw him beating her with the chair - the room door opens into the court. While I was looking through the key-hole, I saw him tie a handkerchief round her throat - he tried to choak her, as it appeared to me; he said at Hatton garden, that when he got out, he would cut me with a knife.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know Mrs. Meltis? A. Yes; I had been selling cucumbers that night, and was quite sober; he kicked her when she was going into the shop; the house is in a broad paved court; he said the first person he caught near him he would murder - he would not let any body go in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where did he strike her with the chair? A. About her back and sides - his face was turned towards the door - he had a waistcoat with sleeves on. I did not see the chair fall on her head at all.</p>

About half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was serving two customers - the deceased came forcing into my shop apparently terrified, and before I got a sight of her the prisoner fetched her back by force, but I could not see how, and in about half a minute I heard a scuffling under my window. I went out and saw the deceased laying on the pavement - the prisoner stamping his feet on her rather than kicking her - I saw that repeated several times; her head lay towards my window, and her feet towards the curb stone; he took her up in his arms, and I saw no more - my shop is next door to the court where they live; she appeared to have no senses left, when he took her up - he stamped on her about the middle of her body, but not all on one place.</p>

I was just at the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150042"/>door - I saw nobody else there - the door was shut; he came and opened it, and went in alone - I went away.

            . I am a surgeon, and live in Cow-cross-street. I was called in to see the deceased on Wednesday, the 3d of August, twenty-four hours after the injury - I found her laying in a most wretched state, perfectly insensible; when I felt her extremities she did not appear to feel at all; I proceeded to bleed her arm, but without success. I afterwards opened an artery, and got about three ounces of blood - I took her some medicine, and with difficulty got two spoonsfull down. I had a blister applied all over her head, and mustard poulticies to her feet; her disease being an oppression of the brain. I was convinced she could not live - she was perfectly sensible all the time, and on Thursday she died. I opened her, and found several bruises under the scalp, very well marked indeed, particularly on the left side of the head - the bruises were inflicted by blows of considerable violence; they were very black, and very extensive. A person being dragged along the pavement would not produce them, but a fall would. I found four ounces of extravasated blood on the left hemisphere of the brain. I ascribe her death to the extravasation, which was caused by the violence on the head - that certainly produced her death; her chest and abdomen were perfectly healthy: there were several bruises on her body and legs, but not sufficient to cause death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Might not the extravasation proceed from other causes? A. The bruises could not. I have in some cases of apoplexy seen extravasated blood, but not so great a quantity - but here there was no cause for apoplexy; there was no fracture: the bruises without the extravasation would not produce death. I saw the prisoner - he paid me 2 s. 6 d. for attending her, and said he would pay me any charge when he received his money. I said she would not survive; he said he was very sorry, and exhibited extreme anxiety. It is not improbable that the edge of stone steps would produce such appearances, except that there was no cut.</p>

There were a great many persons round; I understood two women had been fighting; a girl, who they called Scotchey, was laying on the pavement, quite drunk - it was dark. I saw the blow given, and Gray fall; what happened before that I do not know. The prisoner kicked at him three times while he was on the ground, but whether his feet reached him I cannot be certain - he turned over on his left side, on his hands, got up, and walked away, with his two hands on the bottom part of his stomach, in a leaning position. As he passed my window I saw him bleeding from his face - my husband asked if he was hurt; he returned no answer.</p>

            . I am house surgeon of St. George's Hospital. The deceased was brought in about eleven o'clock on Monday morning, and complained of a stoppage of his urine; he said it was occasioned by a blow he had received the night before - there was every appearance of external violence. I considered him in danger; he was there till Thursday, the 21st, when he died. I opened his body, and found the urinary canal ruptured - mortification had ensued, which caused his death; there was no appearance of previous indisposition; it was certainly a recent complaint. I should suppose great violence must have caused it - there was no external wound; it might arise from a blow or kick.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Falling against any very hard substance might occasion it? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am ward-beadle of Walbrook, and know Mr. Simpson's house. On the 2d of September, a little before two o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner and another man running along George-street - the prisoner was carrying this piece of cloth, which hung loosely under his arm - this arose my suspicion - I followed, and overtook him with it at the back of the Mansion-house - the other escaped - I asked the prisoner how he came by it - he said a man gave it to him in the street; and said, "Don't hurt a poor fellow" - that is all he said then - I took it from him - he gave it up readily - I took him to the watch-house, and after locking him up opened the cloth, and found the end with the ticket in it, with the name of Marsham on it - I inquired and found a wholesale dealer of that name in Ironmonger-lane - they directed me to Mr. Simpson, who claimed it at the watch-house - when Mr. Simpson came to the watch-house, nothing was said to induce the prisoner to say any thing - he said a person had requested him to take it from Lombard-street towards Temple-bar, and would pay him for it, and I think he said a shilling - he mentioned no house that he was to take it to, but described the person as a man rather tall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say this before Mr. Simpson? A. Yes; he had as good an opportunity of hearing it as me - he said instantly, that another person gave it to him - he must have come through a public street from Mr. Simpson's to get to George-street - he carried it openly - his carrying it that way and running made me suspect him - he said instantly that another man gave it to him.</p>
               <p>EDWARD SIMPSON. He said at the watch-house that some man employed him to carry it to Temple-bar - he gave the account the constable has mentioned.</p>

"Halloo Joe! what are you doing there?" he made no answer, but ran towards the door - on going to the till, I found it half open and the box gone - I had not put it there two minutes before; I ran out, crying Stop thief! but did not tell him till Thursday night, when he came out of Mr. Clark's, opposite - he drew back on seeing me, and got to the corner, running as hard as he could - I followed; he stopped in the archway in the market - two others who were with him, stood looking at me, they at last ran off, he was stopped by the watchman - there was no stranger in the house but him - I charged him with it: he said, I was going to swear his life away.</p>

I kept my eye on them, and, just opposite to Bread-street, I saw the other one take the handkerchief out of Mr. Wilkinson's pocket, and immediately give it to the prisoner, who put it inside his bosom, closed his coat, and crossed over to go down Friday-street - the other went strait by the prosecutor; I caught hold of the prisoner in the middle of the road, and in the scuffle the handkerchief fell down between our feet - the other ran off - he gave no account how he got it.</p>

I then pursued through some courts, and found him in Little Chapple-street, and found 10 s. on him in silver, and 2 s. 9 1/2 d. in copper.

I went down stairs, and found Wharf in the kitchen or parlour, but I did not say any thing about my loss - I staid in the house till morning. I then saw Wharf again, and asked her where the purse was - she said she had not seen it. I said "Where is the 10 l. note;" she said she had not seen a 10 l. note for some time. I afterwards saw Garratt. I did not ask her about the note in the house, but I asked her out of doors - she said she had not seen it. I afterwards made inquiries if two such women had changed a note, and Mr. Fletcher said he had changed it for them.</p>

            . I am a patrol. The prisoner Turner was given into my custody by Hart, on the 30th of August<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150048"/>- I took her to the watch-house, and asked her name - she said Ann Turner, but she was better known by the name of Ann Jones. I found the watch at the pawnbroker's, and then took Jones; I questioned Turner about being with Hart; she denied being with him, and said she knew nothing about the watch, but afterwards, at Queen-square, she said he gave it to her.</p>

I stopped him with this bundle under his arm, and asked what it was. He said "Unmade slops for my mother." I asked where she lived - he said up this way. When I got about half way up Blue-coat-fields, he said he was sorry he had told me a lie - that he bought it of a man for two shillings.</p>

               <p>GEORGE HALL re-examined. Q. Had you lent the prisoner your books? A. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many years have you known the prisoner? A. Seven or eight years; we have been on terms of intimacy; he has had books of all sorts of me from time to time.</p>

I said, "No, I will not, I will stand my ground" - I have every reason to believe that the son robbed his mother himself as I have heard them say that they have not bought any thing themselves.</p>

I recollect the prosecutor coming with a bundle, tied in a blue spotted handkerchief - he kept it in his hand nearly all the time he was there - he spoke to an acquaintance, and laid down the bundle on the table to have some oysters. As I was going into the tap-room, I met the prisoner going out with the bundle, but I did not know, but that she was a friend of his - he said to me in a minute or two, "Where is the bundle;" I said, "That woman who has been drinking here, took it" - he then went away - the prisoner returned in a few minutes without a bundle, and I detained her.</p>

I knew nothing of it for a week afterwards, when I was going out, and my landlady called me back, and said "You did not send the sheets." I said they were returned, and she said they were not.

               <p>RICHARD HOUSEMAN. I am married. On the 6th of September, I had been out taking supper, and was returning home at past one o'clock. I met the prisoner near <placeName id="t18250915-127-crimeloc690">Chiswell-street</placeName>

I then put my hand into my waistcoat pocket, and missed a sovereign which I had had there. I then felt in my trousers pocket, and missed a crown piece. I said "You have robbed me;" she said she had not - the watchman was near, and I gave charge of her; she said, in the presence of the watchman, that she had no such thing as a crown about her - she was searched, and a sovereign and some shillings were found, but not the crown piece.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. I met this gentleman in Featherstone-street; he spoke to me first - I then walked towards my own home, and had got the length of two streets - I then heard him walking after me, and some one said, "Stop a bit." I then turned round, and he said I had taken his money; I only said the money I had about me was my own. I did not say I had not a sovereign. Witness. You said several times you had no sovereign at all.</p>

I went up one pair of stairs; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150053"/>took my watch out, and laid it on the table. When I had been in the room about a quarter of an hour she moved from one side of the room to the table, and put the candle out - she pretended to go down to light it, and I went after her, and found her on the stairs, with the watch in her hand. I suspected that she had got my brooch as well; I alarmed the landlady, and gave her in charge; she was taken to the watch-house, but nothing was found upon her.</p>

We went on the bed together, and in four or five minutes, she got up and ran down stairs. I had before that, paid her 1 s. for the room. I got up and went down stairs. I crossed the road, and waited there some minutes; a woman came and asked me if I had lost any thing - I said "My money;" she asked if I had lost anything else. I then found my pocket-book was gone - she said "Come over, and perhaps I may find it." I then crossed over to the house where I had been, and saw a woman going up stairs with the book under her apron; she got to the top, and threw the book down.

On the 12th of August, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, I met the prisoner in a public-house in the Broadway, Westminster; she came in several times, and asked me to go with her to another house in Tothil-street - I was not over drunk. I went with her to that house, and then to another, which she said was her lodging; but when we got there, a woman came and demanded 1 s. for the use of the room, which I paid her; she then asked for some liquor, and I gave her another 1 s., but had no change from it. I then gave her 2 s. I had three sovereigns and 10 s., which I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150054"/>told in her presence, and put them into a bag, which I put in my left-hand trouser's pocket. I had some more loose silver in my pockets. I took off my trowsers, doubled them up, and put them under my pillow - she said "You need not be so careful, you will not be robbed here." I put a chair against the door, as the lock did not fasten well. I fell asleep, and was awoke by her hand being in my pocket - my money was gone, but my purse was left; she then went down stairs, and I should have followed, but I was naked - she was dressed different to what she was before. I got up and put my clothes on, and went to Mr. Hayne's, to buy some tools - he is a constable; he sent me to another constable, who went with me and took the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Why did not you seize her with her hand in your pocket? A. I had not time, she was too quick for me. I do not know whether she opened the door and any other person came into the room. I had been in company with two or three women and a man, who said he was a carpenter - he said to me, "Halloo! old mate, come and treat us. I gave them a pint of gin altogether.</p>

On Sunday night I heard a noise in the street; I came down, and this witness and another ushered the prisoner into the house; he said, "You shall not search me - you are no officer;" I said, "Then I am, I will search you," and in his small-clothes I found this handkerchief. I called on Mr. Riley the same night, who claimed it.</p>

On the Saturday following he came with a black girl, and another woman - he said he wanted to treat his wife with a beaver bonnet, and a fine feather in it; I objected to let him have it, but I was prevailed on to do so by my daughter; he said the ship would be paid off on the Monday, and he would come and pay for the hat and bonnet; he got to the window, and was pulling some of the travelling caps about, and put some of them upon his head; I then saw him lean against the counter, buttoning his jacket. As soon as they went out of the shop I followed - they went into a chandler's-shop at the corner of Little Union-street - I then crossed the way, and peeped in at the window; I saw him with a travelling cap on his head, which I had been shewing to a gentleman an hour before. When they came out I followed them to a house in Little Union-street. The next morning I went to the Lord Exmouth, public-house, where he said he boarded, but he was not there. I then took an officer to No. 3, Little Union-street, where he found the cap and the prisoner. I waited for them at the chandler's-shop, where I had seen him the night before; he had left his hat at that house. I am positive the cap is mine - I made it myself.</p>

I apprehended the prisoner - I asked him, what he had done with the shawl, the umbrella, and the tea - he said, he had not taken them, but upon taking him to the watch-house, he said, he had taken the umbrella and shawl, but the tea he knew nothing about - he had taken them out of vexation - when he was before the Magistrate, he said, he had been robbed of half a sovereign: on the following morning, he sent for a person, and told me to go with him to his room, and there I should find the umbrella and the duplicate of the shawl.</p>

I then asked him, if he intended to stop all night - he said Yes; and he would give me a sovereign for the night. I asked him several times for it, but he did not give it to me. I said, if he would give me leave, I would go and get some supper. I put a shawl on, and went out of the room for about five or ten minutes; when I returned, I saw a drawer open, which had been shut when I went out, and some duplicates which had been in a little box in that drawer lying on the floor; there had been in that box a crown piece, a half crown, two shillings, and a sixpence I first picked up my duplicates, and then looked for the money, which was gone. The landlady found some duplicates under the pillow, and under the bed she found the box empty. I had seen the box safe a short time before; when I undressed myself I put the pins on the top of it, which is a pincushion. I had then opened the box, and saw the money all right; my landlady went down and brought up the watchman, who asked me if I would give the man in charge - I said I would; he said he was willing to go, but not till a watchman came to take him. I saw him searched, and a crown, a half-crown, three shillings, and a sixpence taken from him, which were in his left-hand trousers' pocket, and some halfpence in his coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Had you taken the box out to put the pins in the cushion? A. Yes; he said that if I wanted him searched a watchman should be sent for - I had named the money I had lost before I saw it taken out of his pocket - the landlady came up stairs - I asked him for the sovereign several times - I did not go out to get another woman to come and make this charge - I was taken, and searched about a felony, the next night, but it was not true - the man has found his property since - I never went by the name of Wood nor Young, nor any name but my own.</p>

            . I was night officer. I have brought the little box and the money. The prisoner gave no account of how much money he had. I particularly asked him if the girl had seen what money he had - he said No. I then said to the girl, "What money have you lost?" and she told me. I found a crown, a half crown, three shillings and sixpence, and some halfpence, in his pockets; and in his other trousers' pocket I found a small chain and three keys.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The major part of what has been said is false; this female accosted me, and asked me to treat her, which I told her I had not the least objection to. I put my hand into my pocket, and took out all the money I had, and gave half-a-crown to the servant, and the servant went to get some liquor. The prosecutrix drank some, and then went out of the room for about twenty minutes, and then she and two other females came up and accused me of the robbery.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODRICK to SARAH BROWN. Q. Upon your oath did not this gentleman take the money out of his waistcoat pocket; and among that was a crown, a half-crown, and the silver? A. No, he did not. There was no other girl in the room - the girl who fetched the liquor came to the door - the landlady opened the street door, and I took the light from the foot of the stairs - he did not take any money out of his waistcoat pocket - he only took out the half crown, and I think that was from his trousers' pocket - I was not out of the room more than five minutes - the prisoner saw the box found under the bed, but he did not know that the landlady was gone for the watchman</p>
               <p>MR. WINCH. I am an attorney. The prisoner has been clerk to me about six months. On the Saturday night I had paid him the balance of his wages - he was to return me 12 s. on the Monday, as I am security for a suit of cloaths for him.</p>

               <p>One of the papers was here read - it was a letter, addressed to "Mr. Thompson, coal-merchant and brewer, Northampton," and signed William Oglivie, stating, that understanding Mr. Thompson was in want of the loan of 500 l. the writer would discount his promissory notes, of 250 l. each, at six and twelve months date, payable to order, at 5 per cent. discount, and 2 s. 6 d. commission; and desiring to direct to him at the Ram Inn, Smithfield.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Ram-inn, Smithfield. The prisoner was at my house once or twice in April last - I saw him there in a room with Mr. Thompson - it was on a Friday in April; the prisoner had left his card at our house, in the name of Oglivie, and said he had a letter coming from a person, and would I take it in for him. One came, addressed to Mr. Oglivie, at the Ram-Inn, Smithfield, and he took it; this was about a fortnight before I saw him with Thompson; several other letters came in the same name, from Ireland and Scotland, as appeared by the post-marks; he had them all: I did not see him open them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did he say more than this to you, "If any letters come in the name of Oglivie, please to take them in?" A. It was to that purpose - he left a card, which I supposed was his own. I did not find that his name was not Oglivie till after I came here, and heard him plead to the name of Wilson.</p>
               <p>Q. You only thought his name was Oglivie from his leaving that card? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. State what he did about that card? - A. He brought a card, and said, "I have taken the liberty of having a letter addressed, for me, or to me, to your house - will you take it in?" I said certainly, and next day one came - he called the same morning, and took it.</p>

Yes; a gentleman calling himself Moss was there, disputing with Mr. Thompson about possession of the bill; Mr. Isaacs, and a person named Creed, were also there; Mr. Isaacs said Mr. Thompson came there under pretence of taking the bill up, and then put it into his pocket; Mr. Thompson had possession of it when I got there; Mr. Isaacs wished me to take Mr. Thompson in charge, but I did not attempt to do so; he consented to leave the bill in my hands till it was decided; one of Mr. Isaacs's clerks came for me.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did not Thompson consent immediately that it should be in your custody till this trial? A. Yes; he said it was not his hand-writing; that he was not the acceptor of the bill.</p>

            . (looking at one of the letters produced). I received this from the watch-house-keeper of Bunhill-row. I then went to No. 7, Lloyd's-row, and found a bundle of papers in the first room, on the right. This paper (looking at it) was among them: -</p>
               <p>(Letter read.)</p>
               <p>MY DEAR ANN. - I am in custody at Bunhill-row watch-house; let him know by seven o'clock in the morning, or to night, to send Mr. Harmer to me, as I go to Worship-street by ten o'clock - hide my papers. I am in good spirits. Bring me a shirt and stockings by nine o'clock; say to the landlady I am arrested for putting my name to a bill, to oblige a friend - shew this to him., and he will send some one to me with some money.</p>
               <p>To Mrs. Williams, No. 7, Lloyd's-row, Sadler's Wells.</p>
               <p>The paper found at Lloyd's-row, was directed on the back,</p>
               <p>"Mr. Shannon," dated</p>
               <p>"9th June, 1825," contained a list of various bills, amounting in all to 1100 l.; the one in question being among them, and under the list was written as follows. "I have received the above bills from F. Wilson, for which I have given him 50 l. on account, and it is expressly understood between us, that he is to receive a quarter of whatever I recover on them."</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. CREED. Q. What had you to do in this business? A. Mr. Coles being in town, and having had a bill got from him, I went as his friend. I was not employed by any one. I went to search the lodging, and found this paper - no officer was with us. Mr. Coles, my father, and one Cleaveland went with me; he is clerk to Messrs, Cox and Co. army agents.</p>
               <p>Q. Do all these gentlemen happen to form members of a society? A. We do; we belong to the society of Guardians, for the protection of trade - it was established before I was born. Messrs. Foss and Sons are the attornies.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Foss has nothing to do with the society who set this prosecution on foot? A. No; Mr. Matthews is their attorney. That society has nothing to do with the one Mr. Foss belongs to. I did not know Coles till about a fortnight before I went there. I am a member of another society like Mr. Foss's, and so is my father.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. In consequence of Coles complaining to you, did you go there in search of a bill? A. I did; we found his bill there - his name is at the head of this list.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you go to Messrs. Esdaile's, to stop payment of this bill? A. No; Thompson made some application to my father about the bill, and I believe my my father went to Messrs. Esdaile's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not tell your father to stop payment of the bill, because he had been swindled out of it? A. I never heard him tell him so. I know that he said it was a forgery. I think he said the amount was 150 l.; but he understood there were others - he explained to me that the bills were drawn, I think at the Ram Inn, and Mr. Cooper wished him to accept them, but he declined. I do not know how he gained information of the forgery, or how he knew they were made payable at Messrs. Esdaile's.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. What did he state about the bills? A. He said he met Cooper by appointment - that Cooper drew them, and wished him to accept them, which he declined, for, as Cooper was to send the bills into Scotland to be discounted, and as he was a stranger there, they might be sent there without his acceptance, on his (Cooper's) responsibility, and if Cooper would bring the money down to him, at Northampton, he would pay his expenses.</p>
               <p>Q. You mention the name of Cooper; was that the name Thompson knew him by? A. No, he knew him as Oglivie. I call him Cooper, because he was apprehended by that name. We did not discover till afterwards, that Cooper and Oglivie were the same persons. Thompson said he knew him as Oglivie, and he drew the bills as Wilson - it excited his suspicion, and I believe was one reason why he refused to accept.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did Thompson explain how Wilson could get the bills discounted in Scotland without being accepted? A. If the money was got he was to accept them.</p>

            . I keep the Fox and Anchor public-house, Charter-house-lane. Mr. Thompson, of Nottingham, generally comes to my house when he is in town. I first knew him about March or April last. I saw him there, in company with the prisoner, about the beginning of April. I think they came in to my front room, which I call the tap-room; they had some conversation; they came again together in two or three days, had some conversation, and went into my back parlour; they desired<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150060"/>some ham for lunch, which I fetched them, from Charterhouse-street, and after some conversation they desired that some bill stamps should be sent for; I cannot say what the amount was - it was two or three; my little boy fetched them; I took them into the back room myself, and put them on the table; Thompson asked for a pen and ink, which I took into the room; the prisoner wrote on the stamps, and I had occasion to withdraw from the room, to go to the table in the yard, close to the parlour window, which was open, to wash my hands, and saw the prisoner writing on the stamps; after washing my hands I had occasion to go into the room; I believe they then asked for more ale; I took it in, and while I was in the room I saw Thompson writing across one of the stamps; what he wrote I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, did you write a letter to Mr. Thompson on the 4th of June? A. I have written a letter or two to him, and received this letter (one before produced) in answer to mine of the 4th of June; I answered it by post; (looking at another) this was also written to me; I saw him afterwards, and conversed with him about the contents; I have seen him write myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look at this bill - do you believe what is written across it to be his hand-writing? A. I really do - I have not the least doubt of it. I saw him at my house last Saturday week - I think he said to me that it was a hard case to loose so much money - that he did not wish to hang the prisoner if he could get his acceptances back - that there was one coming due in October - he wished me to endeavour to get them if I could - I said I did not know how to proceed in it - I had nothing more to do with it.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Now, take care, did he say "acceptances or bills?" A. I cannot take upon myself to say which.</p>
               <p>Q. To the private room of your house there is a window, which was open, and you could see what passed? A. I saw a great part of it - I did not pretend to wish to know about it - I am quite certain the prisoner wrote on the stamps - I do not know his hand-writing - I never saw him till about a month previous to his coming with Mr. Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. You have sworn they were there on two occasions, one of which was two or three days after the other? A. As near as I can recollect - it might be more - I did not make a minute of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you recollect the bread and cheese one day, and the ham the other? A. Because I have frequently seen Thompson - he has dined with me when I have had roast beef - I was once one of the Fancy - I was called St. Davis when I was on the list - I did not put my head through the window - I did not wish to see what was going on, or I could have looked more minutely - I always knew the prisoner by the name of Wilson.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You went yourself to fetch the ham? A. Yes, that makes me remember it - I have left off fighting about a year and a half - I went to shew Thompson the way to Worship-street - he stated that he had to charge the prisoner with getting either bills or acceptances from him in a manner that was not proper - I cannot say what were his words.</p>

            . I am the holder of this bill - I received it from Shannon - I presented it for payment at Sir James Esdaile's, and then put it into Mr. Isaacs's hands - a gentleman calling himself Wright, but who I found afterwards was Creed, called at my house with Mr. Thompson, and proposed an arrangement to pay the bill, saying that Thompson was defrauded out of the acceptance - I told him it laid in my solicitor's hands, and we three went to Mr. Isaacs - Thompson said he was defrauded out of the bill, and Creed asked Mr. Isaacs if he had any objection to shew the bill - it was shewn to Mr. Creed, who handed it over to Thompson, who walked up to Mr. Creed and said, "Have you your barnacles?" or something of that sort - Creed said he knew nothing about that, and then Thompson put the bill into his pocket - Mr. Isaacs protested against it, and said he should certainly give him in charge unless he gave it up - Forrester was sent for - Creed proposed that Forrester should take charge of it, and they then said it was a forgery - Thompson said it was hard that he should have to pay them - I said</p>

            . I am an attorney, and was instructed by Mr. Moss to apply for payment of this bill - there have been no proceedings taken yet. While I was in possession of it Mr. Thompson called on me, in company with Mr. Moss, and a person calling himself Wright; Mr. Moss said they had called to propose some arrangement; one of them asked if less than the whole amount would be taken; the answer was, that it could not be done without the consent of Shannon, an indorser; something was said about time; Mr. Creed requested a sight of the bill; I called to the outer office for the bill, and put it into Creed's hands; he looked at it for a short period, and handed it to Mr. Thompson, who pretended to be looking for something, and asked Creed if he had his barnacles about him (I should have mentioned that he said he had been tricked out of this and other bills); he then folded up the bill, grasped it very tight, and said, "This is a forgery; I shall keep this bill;" I said I could not allow that, but, if he wished it for the purposes of justice, I should produce it at any time; he insisted upon holding it, and I sent for Forrester.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and know Thompson well. I have seen him write five or six times. To the best of my belief the acceptance on this bill is his writing. I have very little doubt of it. I should not have objected to take it as his acceptance.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. When did you first give information that you knew any thing of his hand-writing? A. I am assistant to a Sheriff's officer; an attorney at Northampton knew I had had business with Thompson; that is the way they found me out; the last time I saw him write was about two months ago, at his own house.</p>

               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What attorney at Northampton applied to you about this? A. Mr. Jay's clerk; he sent to me on Tuesday to know what I knew, and subpoenaed me directly; they applied to my master first, and sent to me as the person who knew the hand-writing; I have seen him sign his name two or three times; I only saw him scribbling two months ago.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was the reason of his scribbling? A. He was making a bill, which he had referred to his son to finish; we had arrested him, and there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150061"/>a bill between the plaintiff and him; I asked for it; he began to scribble.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that scribbling at all like this acceptance? A. Not at all.</p>
               <p>- DAVIS. I am the wife of Cyrus Davis. Thompson came twice to our house with Wilson. I remember the second time; bill stamps were sent for - I think it was two - they were in a little back parlour adjoining the bar - Thompson called for pen and ink - a window looks from that room into the yard - I have seen Thompson write several times, and swear that the acceptance on this bill is his writing.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How often have you seen him write? A. Five or six times - in March, April, and May last - he made no difficulty at writing - my little boy fetched the stamps.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Is there by the window looking into the yard a place to wash hands? A. There is a table at the window - my husband washes his hands there.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were you in the parlour while these persons were there? A. Part of the time - the window was open all day - I have received letters from Thompson, and he has afterwards asked me if I had received them - he wrote to us, stating that there was ale at the wharf for us - we bought ale of him.</p>

             (aged nine years, upon being questioned, appeared to understand the obligation of an oath). I saw the prisoner at my father's house with a stout fat gentleman named Thompson - my father or mother sent me for some stamps, which I fetched from the second house opposite - I fetched two - they were small pieces of paper - I laid them on the table in the little parlour at the back of the bar.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Was the prisoner very much at your house? A. I do not know; I often saw him there, and knew him by the name of Wilson. I do not know when I went for the stamps - it is not very lately.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you recollect what sort of stamps you asked for? A. No: I do not know how much money I had.</p>
               <p>COURT to JONES. Q. How long have you known Thompson? A. For six or seven years - he carries on a large business in bricks, malt, &amp;c.; his sons, I believe, manage the business for him.</p>

               <p>THOMAS SMITH. On the 3d of July, when we came opposite to <placeName id="t18250915-149-crimeloc804">Hickman's gate</placeName>

I had my jacket taken from my back, my hat from my head, and 11 s. from my breeches' pocket - I was knocked down on the ground - I had seen both the prisoners before on that day, and am certain of them; I do not know who took my property, but only them were round me just at the time I missed it - I was not stunned - I felt them take my jacket off, and felt a hand in my pocket, which they turned inside out - there were several people about when I got up, but when my property was taken I only saw the prisoners - Ledger and Foster afterwards came to my assistance. Kelly was afterwards brought down to me to the Swan.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. When did you first go to the Swan? A. About half-past six o'clock in the morning, and left in about an hour - I went there afterwards about five or six o'clock and remained till half-past ten: it was Sunday, and we had not been hay-making that day. I remember seeing Kelly by the Swan that afternoon, - not in the house - I had no words with any body at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say you would have the blood of an Irishman that night? A. No; I cannot swear who took my jacket - I do not know whether my hat fell off or not - I was sober. I saw Sullivan next morning, but did not say I had lost my jacket and hat, and wished I could find them - I said I had lost them, but did not tell him to go and find them - he did not tell me he had seen a strange man run away with my hat - there was no quarrel at the Swan while I was there - I sat in the garden having my porter - Sullivan offered to come as a witness for me, next morning, but as I did not want one he has come against me.</p>

I found Smith laying on the grass bleeding - he had no jacket on; he asked me to go and look at James - we were taking him to the Swan, and met the patrol - it was dark.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to interfere? A. I was going home with Ledger, and heard persons quarrelling half a mile before we got up to them. Smith and James were laying on the field. I think seven men were taken that night on suspicion.</p>

I went and found him laying by the road-side, took him to the Swan, and from information I received from Smith, I went to the out-buildings of Mr. Barnes' premises, and apprehended seven persons - Kelly was one of them; he came off the hay-rick, and I collared him; and seeing a scar on his face, I asked what he had done with the coat - he said he knew where it was; he would not tell me then, but would in the morning.</p>

When I got to the rick, the patrol asked Kelly where the coat was; he said he knew, and would tell in the morning - this was not Smith's jacket; he said there had been a quarrel in the road, and he was there, and after a little hesitation took us to where the coat was.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose these men were gone to rest in the rick? A. No; Kelly was employed as a watchman to guard the rick.

            . I am a labourer. I was at the Swan on the 3d of July, and shaved the two prosecutors; they were both intoxicated; and in the afternoon Fitzgerald was in the parlour - two men and six women were in their company; the prosecutors sat outside - the window was lifted up, and Thomas Smith asked Fitzgerald for a light - he handed him one two or three times; he asked for another, and Fitzgerald said he would be his servant no longer; he then made a blow at Fitzgerald, who put up his hand and stopped it, and about seven o'clock Kelly came into the tap-room with two women, and were drinking a pot of beer; and between ten and eleven o'clock at night, on dispersing, about three or four hundred yards from the house - I was in the road - the two prosecutors went towards the fence, and got two pieces of pailing, crossed over the road, and both hit Fitzgerald; he hit Smith again. Several of my countrymen were near - Kelly wanted to make peace between them, and the prosecutors knocked him down. I called Kelly to me, and while we were in conversation Smith pulled off his coat, threw it into the road, and hit Fitzgerald, who struck him again. I told Kelly he was a man of family, and to have nothing to do with the row, which he accordingly did. Fitzgerald went towards his barn where he slept. A man named Callaghan seized a piece of fence, and knocked Smith down, and one Banks knocked Field down - there was then a general fight between them and the Irish. After the row Smith said he missed his coat, and told me to go and look for it.</p>

I collared Maulden, and caught the handkerchief in the act of falling from his person. I called to the gentleman, who turned round; I shewed him the handkerchief, and told him to secure Hawkins, who had got before him, close by his side; he laid hold of him, brought him to me, and wished me to return the handkerchief, and let them go; I desired him in the King's name to assist me with them to the Compter, but he did not, and has not attended. I do not know his name or residence.</p>

I was in Fleet-street, and saw Hawkins draw a handkerchief from a gentleman's pocket, roll it up, and throw it to another. I do not know the gentleman's name or residence. I afterwards saw Jackson scuffling with Maulden, to get him secured, and saw the handkerchief drop from him. Hawkins escaped, and ran up Shoe-lane, but was taken shortly after. I saw him in custody next day, and am certain of his person.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 30th of August Jackson described a man to me. I went to several houses that night, and found Hawkins at the Coopers' Arms, public-house, West-street, Smithfield, about eleven o'clock at night - it is a very bad house. He denied the charge, but said he was in Fleet-street.</p>
               <p>MAULDEN'S Defence. I was in Fleet-street between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, and kicked against this handkerchief - I picked it up, and put it inside my jacket - Jackson laid hold of me; I opened my jacket to give it to him, and it fell down. I never saw the other prisoner before.</p>
               <p>HAWKINS' Defence (written.) I was passing through Fleet-street between five and six o'clock, on my way to Covent Garden, with my donkey, and heard a cry of Stop thief! turned round, and Jackson accosted me, and said I was his prisoner - that he saw me pick a gentleman's pocket; I said he must be mistaken - the gentleman said he had lost nothing, and advised him to let us go; the persons assembled at last rescued me, and being convinced of my innocence I never avoided apprehension. It must be perfectly obvious to you that I am labouring under a deformity, and have lost the use of my limbs.</p>

I found two keys, wrapped up in a child's frock, between the bed and the sacking - the small key opens the till, and the large one opens the passage door at the foot of the stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you searched the place before you found them? A. Yes, at seven o'clock in the morning - the man was then in bed on the floor. I searched the clothes, and the sacking of the bedstead; but the keys were not there then.</p>

            . The prisoner was in my employ, and left me in the month of July - he had been round on the day he left me to my customers to receive money - he did not account for any money he had received of Mrs. Williams - he came home that evening and put the basket in, and went to a public-house - I went after him and said, "John, will you come and stir the sponge" - he said "Not before eight o'clock." I met him on the following evening between nine and ten, in the Borough. There was 5 s. 4 1/2 d. found on him, which I believe the officer gave him again.</p>

He, in the first instance, denied it, but when the officer began to search him for some of the articles, he pulled out some others, and said he was very sorry, and could not tell what he had taken it for - I think he said he had some trifling debt he wanted to pay.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did he not say there was a Mrs. Davis, to whom he owed 5 s., and she had kept his hat and he wanted to redeem it? A. I believe he did. I have known him some time, and he has conducted himself well.</p>

            . I am an officer. About three o'clock on the 17th of August I was in Drury-lane; the prisoner was pointed out to me by a shop-keeper - I followed, and saw her stop at Mr. Gammage's shop; she then went into a passage next door to his house, and I saw something in her apron. I went, and asked her what she had got - she said, nothing, but I found this bacon upon her - she begged I would not take her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This man saw a woman give me the bacon; he owes me a spite, because I would not give him liquor.</p>
               <p>Witness. There was no woman with her.</p>

In about a fortnight, I asked him for the sheets, and said I would give him a clean pair - he said they were not dirty, but if I wished for them, he would give them to me in the course of the day; he went away, and did not return. Five days afterwards I opened the door, and found the sheets and pillow gone. I met him two days afterwards in Ratcliff-highway, and asked him what he had done with them; he said he had taken them to his bake-house, as it was too far for him to come home to sleep; but he would bring them to me. I met him a second time and he told me the same. I met him a third time, and he said he would bring them in the course of that day. I asked if he had pawned them, and said, if he would give me the ticket, I would get them out; he went into a passion, and asked what I meant.</p>

I then went into my shop, and found there was no half crown in my till. I asked the prisoner if he had taken any money - he said No. The next morning I got Pound, the street-keeper, and gave the prisoner into custody.

            . I am a pawnbroker. The prisoner came to our shop, in Duke-street, Manchester-square, about half-past two o'clock, and brought a whittle - she wanted 3 s. upon it; in folding it up I saw a ticket on the corner; I then asked if it was her own - she said Yes, she had had it two months; she caught hold of the mark, and tore it in two; I then asked her where she had stolen it from: she said from the linen-draper's below: I went there, but they had not lost one. I came back, and the people in our shop had got the mark from her, and I found it was Mr. Gofton's.</p>

The pipes are very tender, if a little thing touches them, they break in half, and being called out frequently at night, I got those things to do what was necessary - they were given to me by a person named Jones, who is now dead, to prevent the gas smelling in the street. Being in some distress at home, in consequence of a child dying, and my wife being but four weeks out of her confinement, I had not returned them, but I told them where I got them, and gave them up.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Graham and Stocks. On the morning of the 7th of September, about half-past seven o'clock, the prosecutor and the officer, came to our house and described the watch, seal, and key; about nine o'clock I went in to breakfast, and Mr. Stocks came in and asked me if I thought this was the watch; I said I thought it was; I went out and went to Timbrell; he said he thought it was; I then ran home; I said, "Who gave this watch?" the prisoner Smith said he did, and that it was his brother's, who lived in Oxford-road; I asked him if he had any seal or key belonging to it, as it was going, and lately would up; he said he had not. The officer came in and I gave him in custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he appear in great trepidation? A. No, not at all - he was not so much confused as I was.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>PRICE'S Defence. I picked up this man between ten and eleven o'clock, very much intoxicated, and then he left three other women - he took me to a booth in the fair, and shewed me a person who, he said, was his brother; he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150074"/>took the watch from his pocket, in Oxford-street, and wound it up, and then gave it into my hand; I went with him to the stable, and I told him I could not stop all night. When I came away I could not awake him, but I came down stairs with the watch.</p>
               <p>SMITH'S Defence. I am perfectly innocent of the crime. I have known this female six months and have gone backwards and forwards to her apartment; on the evening of the 6th of September, I had been at work, I went to the Fair, and drank a little freely; in coming home I suppose I sat down at the step of a door in Bloomsbury, and dropped asleep; when I awoke I went to the prisoner's lodgings; her door was not locked; I went in; she came home in the morning, and said she had been with a gentleman who had entrusted her with this watch, and she was to pawn it and return him the duplicate.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CLAPP re-examined. Q. You had been at the Fair drinking? A. Yes, I had been there four or five hours - I had only had two small glasses of gin and a little beer: I am no drinker. Upon my oath I did not pull out this watch in the street - there was another girl with the prisoner, and she fared with us - she went with us to Regent-street - there were some other young girls in the Fair whom I did not know.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did any thing pass between you as to what you were to pay her? A. No, I had done no more than treated her - I should have paid her in the morning - I meant to have got up and gone home with her.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave Smith an excellent character.</p>

I told the prisoner I had lost my stockings, and said, "As I am going out, have the goodness to let me find them in their place when I come home;" she made no answer, but went out of the room. I returned home, and did not find them; next day I missed other things. I then asked the cook in the prisoner's presence, if she would have the goodness to let me look into her box, which she immediately opened. I then said to the prisoner "Will you open yours?" she did so - the cook then gave me a bag, which she said was the prisoner's. I was about to open it, but she snatched it out of my hand, put her hand into it and took something out, which she put behind her into the box. I looked to see what it was, and it was a yard of muslin, and my stockings, with the marks picked out.</p>

The muslin had been in the drawer, and the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150075"/>stockings likewise. I sent for an officer, and had her taken.

            . I am the prosecutor's wife. On the 1st of July he bought this cheese - it came home about eight o'clock, was in the shop at ten, and a few minutes afterwards I saw the prisoner Robinson turn out of the shop door; I first looked for my weights, but they were all right. I then missed the cheese - it weighed 15 lbs, at first, but I had cut a quarter of a pound off it; I looked about, but could not see any one; I saw it at Lambeth-street the next day - I knew it by a particular mark which I had cut.</p>

            . On Friday, the 1st of July, about half-past ten o'clock at night, I saw Harris with the cheese under his arm, and the other prisoner with him; they were about three hundred yards from Davis' house - after they had passed me a few yards they began to run - I pursued Harris, and took him with the cheese. I said to him, "Is that your brother?" he said it was; I told him to call him - he did, and he came back; I took them into custody, and went round the next morning. I found Davis had lost the cheese.</p>

               <p>EDWARD RAYMENT. I live with my mother, Sarah Rayment, who is a widow, and keeps a public-house - it is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch - she pays the rent and taxes. On the 23d of July, about half-past five o'clock in the afternoon, I went up stairs to brush the billiard-table, and in about half an hour the prisoner and three others came in together. I put the brushes away, and took a pair of boots into the next room. I had laid my watch on a table on the left hand side of the room - the prisoner sat himself down by the side of that table. I then went into the next room with the boots, returned in about two minutes, and immediately missed the watch - the prisoner was also absent. I spoke to the others, and sent for two officers - Gleed came, and in about twenty minutes he brought the prisoner back. He came running up stairs into the billiard-room, and said "What is the matter?" I said "You know very well - I have lost my watch, and you are the person who has got it." He denied all knowledge of it several times, and at last one of his companions spoke to him in Hebrew, and then said in English, "You had better give it up, for you will get us all into trouble." I said he had better give it to me, or they would all be obliged to go to the Office. The prisoner came to me in a few minutes and said, if I would not trouble him with the law, he would produce the property. I said all I wanted was my property. He said I should have it, if Gleed would go with him and fetch it - Gleed went and brought it back - he was detained - the watch is gold, and worth 10 l. alone.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Did you not go up to him and say I know it is a joke? A. No - I said at first to the persons in the room, if that they had taken it in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150076"/>a joke I did not allow such liberties - the prisoner was not there then - when I spoke of a joke I thought one of them might have had it in his pocket - I found that the prisoner lived about half-a-mile off.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was sent for, and searched the three persons in the room. I found nothing about them. I then went down stairs, and met the prisoner coming into the door of the house. I went up stairs with him, and Rayment said, "I think you have got my watch;" he said he had not; I only heard him say that once. The other three talked with him in Hebrew. Rayment then said, "All I want is my property, for I think it might be done in a lark." The prisoner said, "Gleed, if you will go with me I will give you the watch."</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing about not being prosecuted? A. Not in my hearing - I was on the other side of the room, which is large.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you brought him into the room, had you said something very unpleasant had occurred about a watch? A. Yes; and then he said he knew nothing about it; the prosecutor said he must be the person, for nobody else had left the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at your deposition before the Magistrate - you said there "He still denied any knowledge of it?" A. That in the room; he denied it at first in the street; I did not know that what he said in the street was evidence. I have been an officer twenty-six years. One of the Jews said to him, "You must be the man, for nobody else has left the room." They said they would not be charged with things they were innocent of. He said "Gleed, if you will go home with me into Cox-square, Petticoat-lane, I will give you the watch;" and when I got near the square, he asked me to lend him my pocket handkerchief. He went into his house, and came out with it in a handkerchief, and gave it to me, saying, "This is the watch, Gleed, that I took off the table of Mr. Rayment's house; I thought some gentlemen had been playing at billiards, and had left it on the table; I did not take it with an intention to steal it."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. As long as you treated it seriously he was not willing to communicate about it - but directly Rayment said he only wanted the property, he proposed to deliver it up? A. Yes.</p>

            . I am headborough of St. Luke's. I accompanied Gleed to the Wellington public-house, in Shoreditch - the prisoner ran up into the billiard-room - Gleed has stated what he said - I only heard him deny all knowledge of it once - I was not with him in the street - he said he took it out of a lark - it is a large room, I was against the door - they were talking together on the other side of the room.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When I entered the room the watch lay on the table - the three persons knew I had it, and I was only down stairs - the moment I went up I said "Here is the watch; I did not know who it belonged to - I took it out of a joke" - he told the Magistrate he believed it was a joke - the moment I heard it owned, I said I had got it, and would produce it. I have been to that house for three years.</p>
               <p>EDWARD RAYMENT. I never saw him before.</p>

On Sunday, the 31st of July, between six and seven o'clock in the morning, I was at the stair case window, and saw him go down the yard into the dye-house - he came back, up the yard, and, as I supposed, went into the warehouse - he had business in the dye-house, but not in the warehouse. I went down stairs and found the warehouse door nearly closed, and him inside - he seemed rather alarmed at seeing me; I said "Wynn, what are you doing here?" he answered</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Sir;" I said "You have no business here; I am sure you are doing something which you ought not;" he said "No, Sir." I observed that his hands were all over annatto, and said "Where is that annatto which you have taken out of the cask?" there was a cask of it in the warehouse - he said "Here it is;" pointing behind him; I said "Hand it over to me;" he handed the parcel to me - I went out of the warehouse, and remonstrated with him on his conduct - he walked down the yard - I said "Don't think to escape, for you shall not:" he said "No, Sir;" I turned round to speak to the servant girl, who stood in the passage - he ran down the yard, and got over the gate - I went to the front door - he was running along the street - I called Stop him! - a man ran and brought him back to me - I gave him in charge. The parcel of annatto was in the warehouse - it had been taken out of the cask, and wrapped in paper - it weighed 9 lbs., and cost me 3 s. 6 d. a pound - he said it was his first offence. I was in the warehouse the night before, it was not taken out of the cask then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. How long has he lived with you? A. Since May, 1821, and was one of my best workmen - the parcel of annatto was on a cask in the warehouse - he had been in the dye-house, but had not performed his duty there. I have two boys in the warehouse - they leave at eight o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near was the annatto cask from the parcel? A. It was on a cask close to it.</p>

On the 28th of July, about eight o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoners two or three times - my apprentice pointed them out to me, as they passed my window. I gave directions to my workmen, in the back shop, to be on the alert; and very soon after, I saw them cross on the opposite side of the way, and soon after Bullock placed himself in front of the square of glass, which was broken before - it was cracked in three directions - the piece was not out; it was sufficiently secure to keep together, unless force was used. Samuel then came up, and placed himself in front of the window, near the door. Bullock immediately put his hand under his apron, and I saw him cutting the putty from the glass. After he had been at work some time, he forced the glass in with his hands still under his apron. Salmon then came alongside him, and Bullock put his hand through the aperture which had been made, and took out six pairs of spectacles, which lay in a little tray; they both turned from the window, and were moving off very gently - they were close together. Samuel concealed Bullock from persons who were passing; they went from the window. I went out and laid hold of Bullock with the spectacles in his hand. I then laid hold of Samuel, who was separating from him - my men came out. I came to the warehouse, searched Bullock, and found a piece of wire bent at each end on him - Samuel had nothing - the spectacles cost me 46 s. Bullock reached his arm half into the shop to get them.</p>

            . I am apprentice to the prosecutor. I was in the back shop, and saw the prisoners at the window. I saw Samuel by the door, and Bullock by the glass, which I afterwards perceived was cracked. A man came to the door, and wished to speak to my master. I came into the front shop to call my master down, and opened the door to let the man in - he came in. I then saw the prisoners walk from the window. I called my master, and while he was coming down stairs, I looked at the window where Bullock had been, and found it had been cracked. I had opened the shutters about a quarter past six o'clock - it was safe then. I pointed them out to my master standing on the opposite side of the way, and saw no more of them till he had secured them, when I assisted in taking them to the watch-house. I saw Bullock drop the spectacles on the stones, after my master had secured them - Goddard picked them up.</p>

            . I am in Mr. Richardson's employ. On the 28th of July, I was in the kitchen under the shop window, and saw the prisoners talking by the shop. I looked up to watch, and in a few minutes they came up to the window, placed themselves there and said "Now look out, look out;" the other prisoner replied "It is all right, go on." I then thought it time to go up. I spoke to my master, who stood in the passage, then went round the back way, and met my master, who went out in front - I met him with the prisoners. Bullock said "We have done nothing." I saw him drop the spectacles from his right hand on the ground - I picked them up, followed him to the watch-house, and gave them to my master.</p>

On the 14th of July, about the middle of the day, the prisoner came there to hire a horse; he said he wanted it for a few hours ride, to go to Poplar, for which he paid me 8 s. 9 d. It was a grey gelding, with a bridle and saddle, and worth twenty or thirty guineas - he took it away. I did not observe which way he rode, he said he should be back in a few hours, but he did not return. I saw the horse again on the 2d or 3d of August, and had seen him at his mother's a day or two before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. His mother is a lady living at Camden-town? A. Yes; he is eighteen or nineteen years old; his sister had been a pupil of ours - she met with an accident; he came to the school afterwards, and got acquainted with my father; he took the remainder of her lessons. I went with my father on the 2d of August to his mother's, but I remained outside on horseback; my father sent me for an officer. I then went in and saw the prisoner; I believe he had told my father that he had rode the horse to Windsor.</p>

            . I am a coach-master at Windsor. On the 15th of July, I saw the prisoner at Windsor, riding up and down the town on a grey pony. I told my porter if that gentleman should pass, and should like to sell his pony, I should like to buy it. I went to my farm, which is a little way out of Windsor, and when I returned next night my porter spoke to me, and in a few minutes the prisoner came into my office; the porter said, that was the gentleman who wished to sell his pony. I accompanied him down to the Swan Inn, had it out of the stable; the bridle and saddle were put on. I rode it up the town, and on returning asked him the price of it; he said his father had given 20 l. for it, but as it was not able to carry him, it was for sale, he asked 14 l. or 15 l. for it; it had two broken knees, and was rather lame - I offered 10 l.; he said he could not think of taking that; we went on to the Swan, he at last said he wanted money, and I should have it. I rode it home, and said I should send the money down to Lillywhite, the landlord, who would pay him, as he owed them a bill. I asked his address, he gave his father's address, Mr. Charles Stirling. I have lost the direction; I sent it up by one of our coachmen, and have not seen it since. I sent the money about nine o'clock that evening (Saturday), sent to town next morning, and found the address correct.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BOLLAND. Q. You are a coach-master? A. Yes, I am in partnership with Mr. Lillywhite,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150078"/>who keeps the Swan; the prisoner did not apply to me to sell it; I did not hear of his having been robbed by some women - I think his bill was about 2 l.</p>

I live with Mr. Thumwood - he told me, if the prisoner wished to sell the pony, he should like to buy it - this was on Friday - I said nothing to the prisoner about it, but on Saturday he came to the office, and asked me at what time the coaches went to London - I said, at six o'clock, nine, three, and five, and that the fare was, 4 s. outside, and 7 s. in - to the best of my recollection, he said, "I was very tipsy last night." I said, "Yes, Sir, I saw you were, the back of your coat was very dusty, and I thought you had had a fall;" he said, yes, he had a violent fall; I said, "I thought you were out of your mind" - he then said, the pony did not exactly suit him, it was not big enough, he thought he should sell it, and have a bigger, which would suit him better. I said, "If you wish to sell it, I have no doubt my master will buy it;" I do not recollect that I had said a word about my master buying it before - he offered it for sale first; I asked the price, he said, about 14 l. for the saddle, bridle, and pony, and that he gave 20 l. for it - he did not say he would call again in the evening, but he did come, and my master that evening gave me ten sovereigns to take to the Swan, to pay for it - I understood my master was to pay the prisoner, which I did, and got a receipt signed C. Sterling.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Can you swear, whether you was the first person to offer to buy the horse, or he to sell it? A. I never mentioned a word about buying it, till he said he would sell it - our coach office is at the Swan - I did not know that the horse was detained, but I thought the young man was short of money - I had seen him just before dusk, riding to and fro in the town - many people thought him mad - he did not tell me he had been robbed.</p>
               <p>JAMES MARTIN, SEN. I have seen the horse in the possession of Thumwood it is mine - I did not see the prisoner from the 14th of July to the 2d of August, when I saw him at his mother's house, No. 47, Park-street, Camden-town - I myself did not know him before - his sister had been a pupil of mine in July, 1824; I did not know where she lived: after the horse was lost, I received two letters, I believe both came from the prisoner - I have lost one, the officer has the other, it is signed, "Anonymous." I went to his mother's house on the 2d of August, and saw Miss Sterling; I told her the purport of my visit, and she fainted away - I called the landlady of the house to her, she recovered a little, and went up stairs, and fainted again on the stairs - the prisoner came down, and I asked if his name was Charles Sterling, he said, Yes - he then walked into the parlour, and sat down - I asked if he hired a horse at my school on the 14th of July last; he said he did; I asked what he had done with it - he said, he had sold it to Mr. Thumwood, coach proprietor of Windsor - I produced the letter, and asked if he had written it - he said, he did - I inquired how I could receive the horse back; he said, he could not tell, but he would remunerate me for the loss at some future period - he would not state exactly what period, but said he should be in possession of money at some other time - I asked if he had any friend who would come forward to guarantee the payment - he said not - I then said, I could not suffer myself to be robbed with impunity, and must give him in charge; my son fetched an officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you never attend the prisoner at the school? A. No. The letter has the Camden-town post-mark upon it. I went to the post-office, and they told me where they lived. My impression is, that he did not intend to steal it, from the penitence and reflection he seemed to have - I really think that to be the case.</p>
               <p>The letter was here read, as follows: -</p>
               <p>SIR - Your generosity and forbearance towards an unfortunate young man, shall ever be remembered with veneration and gratitude by me. - He has entrusted me with a secret, on which his life depends. Think me not presumptions when I address you a few words on his behalf; he has a mother and a sister, both of them are so honourable, and so fond of him, that were they acquainted with the capital deed he has been guilty of, they would not survive it, I am sure, at the utmost, more than a month - the rest of his family are of the most respectable; and of high rank, both in the Army and Navy, I urge this not in palliation of the crime he has been guilty of, but that you may be induced to spare the feelings of his poor family, by whose exposure and ultimate consequences of the law, they would be involved in misery and despair. He has been driven headlong to commit a crime, at which he now shudders, and recoils back with horror; his conscience gives him such true agony, that I am fearful he will soon labour under an abjuration of intellect - As you are a good man, and a charitable man, forbear the prosecution and exposure for a season. Though I am poor at present, still I hope it will soon be in my power to make you ample compensation for the loss you have sustained by him. Although I am urging a powerful request, yet the case is of such a momentous nature - the fate of three persons are involved in it - the mother, sister, and brother; if the latter were exposed, the two former would certainly fall victims; and, it is for their sakes more than for his own that he now appeals for your clemency and charity, by the practice of which virtues in this instance you will hereafter meet with an equivocal reward. For God's sake treat not this supplication lightly, but exercise your goodness; and as to the loss, if money can cancel it, although, as I said before, I am poor at present, and not able to remunerate you according to your deserts, yet, as soon as it is in my power to do you justice, depend on it I will not fail in the full achievement of my promise.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the testimony, and are best able to judge of the case. I can say with a clear conscience I never intended to steal it; I did not say I was going to Poplar - it is a mistake. I had not the slightest idea of committing a crime at the time; when at Windsor I was unfortunately deprived of what money I had; fell into the company of women of a low description, and was robbed of my money. I had none to defray my bill, and did not know what to do. I should have returned to London immediately if I had had a few shillings. I inquired the fare to town, and should have gone to town and told Mr. Martin immediately, but having no money I could not; and as the offer was made me I sold it, without thinking of the criminality. I returned to town directly, and told a friend of it; he said I had been guilty of a felony, and after a fortnight elapsed, I wrote a letter, as if from a friend.</p>

On the 8th of August, between three and four o'clock, the prisoner knocked at the door - I opened it, and asked what he wanted; he gave no answer, but pushed himself into the back-room; I stopped him, and asked what he wanted; he said, "I want to know the rent of your shop;" there was a bill up to let it: I said 4 s. a week. He asked me to lend him a rule, cane, or string, to measure the place; I said I had none: he said, "You can find a bit of string somewhere or other I should think." I went to the cupboard, but could find none, and while I was there he said, "Never mind, I will go home and fetch some." I turned my eye up to the mantel-shelf, where the watch had hung, and it was gone. I ran after him, and before he had got half way along the passage I saw the chain hanging out of his hand; I called out Stop thief! nobody heard me, and he got away, but was brought back in less than an hour, by my sister, who was out when he came. I saw it safe a few minutes before he came - I am certain he is the man.</p>

I saw a crowd about my house as I came home, and saw my sister crying; she described the prisoner's person and dress to me - I saw him in less than three quarters of an hour, going towards town, from Islington, with another boy; I did not know him before. I went to several people to lay hold of him, but at last took him myself - I told him he had been in my house, and stolen a watch; he asked what time of day it was, and told me not to catch hold of him - he turned back with me; he and the other lad abused me very much: he said he would punish me for taking hold of him. He had a bundle of matches in one hand, and ballads in the other - he gave them to the other lad; he then took off his hat, and gave him a small parcel about the size of my fist, out of it. I met Cope in a few minutes, and gave him in charge. My sister said he was dressed in a light jacket, nankeen trousers, with a pink stripe in it, and a broken hat - he was dressed so.</p>

On Saturday evening, about seven o'clock, I settled his wages with him; he went out of the shop, not having finished his work, and did not return, I did not miss this property till I found him at Guildhall, with it, and have no doubt of it being mine, though I cannot find a deficiency in my stock. I was fetched to town, and found all the prisoners in custody at Guildhall, with the property - it is worth 7 l.</p>

            . I am Mr. Constable's apprentice. - Clayton worked for him. On the Friday before he went he asked me if I would write a direction for him, and I think I saw that direction on a box at Guilhall.</p>
               <p>Q. You must know your own writing? A. Yes; but at the time I wrote it I was tipsy. I believe it to be mine, it is to the same purport as I wrote. I went to London after my master; the property appeared very much like my master's; but hats in that state are alike - he did not come to work after Saturday. I saw him off for London at eleven o'clock on Saturday night by the coach - he had nothing with him, but his bundle, which I fetched from his washerwoman. I did not see the direction put on the box; he told me he wanted to send a parcel to his wife, and to direct it to James Turner. I said "Why direct it to him?" he said he wanted him to take it to his wife. I wrote the direction as he desired me.</p>

            . I am proprietor of the White Horse Inn, Cripplegate. This box arrived there on Tuesday, the 9th of August, about eight o'clock in the morning; and that morning, the prisoners Turner and Walduck called to inquire after it. Clayton waited outside while they came down the yard. I suspected them the moment I saw them, and said "Call tomorrow morning, and then the waggon will be in;" they all went off in company. I then had the box opened, and found it contained unfinished hats - some of them marked "C." I got Herdsfield to attend, and next morning Walduck came and said he had called for a box in the name of Turner. I asked if his name was Turner - he said Yes. I asked if he could identify the box by the direction, or any key - he said No; but he could tell the contents. I asked what they were - he said "Hats." I said "Mind what you are about, I am a very particular man - is your name Turner?" he said it was. I then called Herdsfield, who took him - he then said his name was not Turner, that he was only sent by another person, who was waiting in the tap-room. I went into the tap-room, and found the other two prisoners there - they were secured, and the box taken before the Alderman.</p>

I said it could not arrive till next day - the other prisoners stood at his elbow. I saw them all three next day - Walduck came first for the box, which was directed to be left till called for, in the name of J. Turner.

He said, "Are you an officer from London." I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150081"/>said, "I am an officer, but not from London, and that I took him for robbing his master" - (he was passing by the name of Smith, and told me his name was not Richards.) I cautioned him to say nothing, but he said, "I shall feel relief in stating to you the whole transaction;" he stated the kindness of his employer, and the bad company he had been led into, and said he was extremely sorry, and asked what would be the end of it? but he wished to unburthen his mind; that he had robbed his master, and whether he said it was under 100 l. or 120 l., I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Horsemonger-lane Prison, July 18, 1825.</p>
               <p>DEAR HENRY, - This comes with all my kind love to you. I hope you are well: since the unfortunate day I left, your house is in my sight; and when I was in it I little thought it would be my doom to be one of them; but I hope you have never stopped out one night since. If I had my time to come over again I would never stop out another night: there would be a difference in my character; but it is now too late for me to repent, for I am sure Mr. Wilson will prosecute to the utmost extent of the law: why should he not, because I have robbed him of money to a great extent: but if I should not be prosecuted I shall pay him by instalments. I have had several fits since I was taken, but am happy to what I was before I was taken. For God's sake I hope they will not prosecute for my family sake, for I am the first who was ever inside a prison. The portion is bread and water, but I cannot smell it - the very sight makes my blood turn again; but I don't want, thank God; but I ought not to mention his name. If I had taken my dear grandmother's advice, and that gentleman, whom I have robbed to that great extent, I should be as happy as the day is long, but now to be shut within a cell, fast bolted up, and high walls well secured, and when I saw Mr. Willson and Mr. Davis, I never felt such a sensation before; I sweat blood from the arm-pits. I wish I could recall my time again and alter my conduct, and if I should get off, that will be a warning to me, and I will warrant you I would never do what is wrong again. If you will call on me between twelve and two o'clock, or write to me, and tell me whether he intends to prosecute. I desire, Henry, don't look at my spelling, for I have been in such a dreadful sensation.</p>

             by sight, that is all. On the 20th of April a barge of slates, called duchesses, arrived at my wharf - they were mine - I told the prisoner to send two loads of them to the Penitentiary, but had not directed him to dispose of any others to any person, and certainly not to Haskins.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you allow the prisoner to sell any slates for you? A. At one time I allowed him to sell a sort called waste, but no others; there was a pass-book kept, in which he furnished me with an account of what he sold; he always had a desire to sell slates, but I forbid him; he had paid me money for some which he had sold, perhaps two days before he was taken: there never was a meeting for the purpose of settling this business, and there was never a balance of 30 l. due to me from him - I have an entry in my book, on the 23d of June, when he paid me some money. He lived in a house of mine on the wharf - I lived at a distance; if a person came to give orders they made inquiries of him; he generally settled with me on a Saturday evening, for the slates he sold - there were some deficiencies, but I did not think it worth while to discharge him for them, being an old servant.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Had he at any time after, no authority from you to sell valuable slates, by the cart load? A. No never - there is no entry of a cart load of slates sold by him in his book - there is no entry of two cart loads sold to Haskins. I did not find it out till July - this little book is the prisoner's wife's writing - he cannot write himself. I have had no meeting with him or his wife, in which it was stated that if 30 l. was paid, the business should be settled.</p>

The prisoner gave me orders, at six o'clock next morning, to load the cart with two loads of slates, which I was to carry to the Vauxhall-road, about a quarter of a mile beyond the Penitentiary - he said I should meet Mr. Haskins there, and that the slates were for him. I met him, and he told me to put the slates down by the side of Mr. Westmacott's wall, near the iron foundry. I took them at two separate times, in Mr. Struthers' cart. Haskins gave me 5 s. a load for taking them - I do not generally receive so much; I never gave my master information about it till I had been examined. I had told the prisoner I thought matters were not going on right, and it would be found out: he said it will make no odds to you.</p>

            . I am a slater, in the employ of Mr. Struthers. I saw these Duchess slates in the wharf, but did not see them come. I saw two loads taken by Webb past the Penitentiary - the prisoner was standing by when they were loaded; there were two loads ordered by my master the night before, to be taken to the Penitentiary, but these were taken beyond it.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner on the 30th of June, and was present at the examination before the Magistrate. I heard a paper read to the prisoner - he cannot write, nor read writing himself -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150082"/>it was signed by Mr. Wyat. When I took the prisoner, I told him I wanted him about some slates; as we were going down Millbank-row, I thought he would have fainted. I said "Fear, what is the matter?" he said "I feel I have done wrong about the slates, and if I had hearkened to my wife I should not have done it." When he was before the Magistrate, what he said was taken down, and read over to him; but I do not recollect what he said. I apprehended Haskins and Brandon or the 30th of June. I took them before the Magistrate, and they were examined at night; they promised to be there the next day, but they got away, and I could not find them since.</p>
               <p>MR. STRUTHERS re-examined. Q. After the prisoner had been apprehended, did he say any thing to you? A. Yes; I asked Webb, in his presence, if he did not take two loads of Duchesses out of the yard; he said he did. I then asked Fear if that was true; he said it was, and he was very sorry he had done wrong.</p>

I received information that she was lodging with one Cox (who had been occasionally employed by me), in Earl-street, Edgware-road. I had considered Cox as married - I went there between six and seven o'clock the next morning, and saw a coach at the door, with the prisoner's boxes in it: I told the coachman not to stir till I had got an officer - I then got Hewitt and Morris; we went up into the room and found Cox, Isted, and Waters, drinking some spirits, which appeared to be rum and gin: I saw some property there which I knew to be mine - the prisoner's boxes were then searched, and thirty yards of ribbon, a locket, a necklace, with a basket attached to it, and some gimp, which I believe to be mine, were found - I had not given them to her - I had seen the gimp, the Friday before the Monday on which she left me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you give Isted warning? A. Yes, she had been taken to Bow-street, but not on this charge, on the 26th. When she left me, I searched her boxes, but found nothing of mine - I have given the servants a present of a bit of ribbon on my birth day, but I never gave them any ornaments, or any thing improper for them to wear - I did not wish that after all, Isted and Waters should remain in my service - Waters left me the same night; it was the officer who searched the boxes, and an officious person, named Cox.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did that officious person, Cox, search the boxes before they left your house? A. Yes, I had a charge against my coachman at Bow-street; in consequence of what I there heard, I turned Isted and Waters away that night; I had given my servants two yards of ribbon on my birth day, but I never gave them thirty yards alike - the boxes were searched, just before they left, on the top of the stairs - Waters had given me warning two or three days before - I am sure the prisoner did not give me warning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where was she when you searched? A. In custody at Mary-le-bone-office. I did not tell her I had found these things - they were produced to her at the office; I had not seen any list given by Miss Kidney.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was she present when these things were produced before the Magistrate? A. Yes, between two and three o'clock, on the 26th of July - I had told her I had got the key, and was going to search her box - it was at her second examination, these things were produced - I think she said Miss Kidney had given them to her, alluding particularly to the ribbon.</p>
               <p>MISS KIDNEY re-examined. Q. When did the prisoner leave you? A.

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. The lady searched the prisoner's box - there were some beads found in a small box in the large one, these appear to me to be them. I asked Miss Kidney if they were her's - she said she had given them to Phillis - there was a locket found which Miss Kidney saw. I had a list of articles on the 27th of July, which she said she had lost - I attended at the office, and gave evidence.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150083"/>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did Miss Kidney, on the 22d, make a complaint of what had been lost? A. Yes, and I took Isted upon the 23d, but none of the property was then found - there was a complaint against this lady's coachman before that - I went round with the list to the pawnbrokers, but could not find any of the property - some beads were returned to the prisoner at the Office, but I do not know whether they were the beads I found in the box - there was a locket found by me on the 22d - that I swear - I was called as a witness by the prisoner, and gave my evidence.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Do you, or do you not believe, that those are the beads and the locket you saw in the box? A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>- BROWN. I am a married woman. I know Miss Kidney. I was her servant, I think in the year 1814 or 1815. I have been to her house to see her while Isted was there. I was there when Isted's box was searched, but I have no recollection of the day. I believe the coachman was then in custody. I saw a little box taken out of the large one, which had in it a little blue necklace. I think I should know it if I saw it, but I do not think this is it. I think they were larger beads, and only two rows of them - the officer shewed them to Miss Kidney. There were some ribbons found, and two white gowns, and one blue muslin, with imitation lace flounces. Miss Kidney said she had given them to her. She then returned to the parlour and said to me, "See what I have given these girls." When I lived with Miss Kidney she was very much given to drink, particularly at night - I think she is very treacherous. She has asked me, since the prisoners have been in custody, if I could tell her any thing against them, and she would give me an anodyne necklace. Mr. Butler and Miss Cressy were present when she said that. I never heard her say whether Phillis had given her warning or not.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When this servant had left, did not Miss Kidney send for you to assist her? A. Yes; she asked me if the girls owed me any thing; I said Yes, a sovereign for some shoes my husband had made; she said I might not see them again, but I begged her not to trouble herself about it. I saw a necklace found, but not a locket. I saw this broad bit of ribbon found, but not the narrow - the only thing I can swear to is this broad ribbon. Miss Kidney had all the things shewn to her, and very readily disclaimed them all. I have heard her give these girls the best of characters.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. I ask you, whether this search was not while the prisoners and Taylor were in the house? A. Yes; I cannot swear to this narrow ribbon, nor do I think any one could.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where do you live? A. At Chiswick - I was subpoenaed to attend. I had called at the Asylum where I was brought up, and the gentleman there told me Miss Kidney had left word for me to call upon her - she should be glad to see me. I went to her house in the morning, and stayed till the evening. I believe the girls were going to leave, to be married, and it looked to me like a bit of spite. I think it was about eleven o'clock in the morning when the box was searched. I was up stairs in Miss Kidney's room, and the box was there. I had not heard before that Taylor had been sent for. No one desired me to be present to see what was in the box.</p>

            . I remember Signor Spagnoletti coming to give me a lesson in music on the day of the drawing room, the 8th of June; he left his pencil-case behind him, which I understood to be gold. Mr. Harrison called afterwards, and wanted a pencil - I saw him use this. Isted then dressed me to go to Court - the prisoner and

             were there; Isted and Waters then went out, and when I went away I saw the pencil-case there, and I desired Isted to take particular care of it - when I returned I missed it, and said to them all three, "Have you seen it?" they all denied it, and Cox said, what business should she have up in the drawing-room. On the following morning Signor Spagnoletti called, and we could not find the case. I do not know that Cox's husband had been at my house that day; he had been there once, but I refused his coming again.</p>

            . In the course of a second search at the house of Cox, about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 26th of July, I found this pencil-case in a jar by the side of the mantel-piece; Cox was not there, but her husband was.</p>
               <p>ERNESTO DIANA DOMENICA SPAGNOLETTI. This is my pencil-case - I left it upon the piano-forte at Miss Kidney's, on the morning of the 8th of June; I think I called a day or two afterwards - Miss Kidney is mistaken in saying it was the next day: we could not find it. I gave a guinea for it - I bought it because it belonged to poor Naldi.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Can you swear to it? A. Yes, by a mark I made upon it.</p>
               <p>MICHAEL MORRIS re-examined. Q. Were you at the Office when the pencil-case was mentioned to the prisoner? A. Yes, and I think it was the last prisoner who said that was the case which was left in the drawing-room.</p>

On the morning of the 11th of July, I missed a pair of trousers from a glass case; there was a jacket there, and another pair of trousers were put in the place of those which were taken. I called Southam, the prisoner, and the servant girl, and said "Here is the old work going on again, and I am determined to discover who is the person;" they all denied knowing you thing of them. Southam proposed to have an officer to have them all searched; the prisoner then went to the other shop at Shadwell. I said, "We will have an officer," I went for him, and sent the servant to fetch the prisoner back. When I returned, Southam stated, that the prisoner asked where I was gone, and the moment he told him he ran into the yard, and Southam found the trousers, in the prisoner's presence, down the necessary; the prisoner cried, and said, "O my father." I think these trousers are mine, but my servant can speak more positively.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any mark on them? A. No; the prisoner was with me two or three years - he was sometimes at my other shop - I considered that he had a good character - my apprentice had absconded long before this - I had not a very good opinion of him.</p>
               <p>HENRY SOUTHAM re-examined. Q. Did Mr. Hart swear to this property at the office? A. I believe he did, but I was out of the office at the time.</p>

The prisoner came in on the night of the 31st of July, and called for some porter; he asked if he could not sit down, and I directed him to the club-room; he stopped about half an hour. I saw him come along the passage, and go towards the door; my daughter cried out, "Mother, we are robbed;" I called Stop thief! he went out, and she followed him; he came back in a few minutes, with his hat in his hand, and said, "Are you the landlady?" I said, Yes. He then said, "I have got some property of your's, which I will give you;" I said, "My husband is not at home - I will not take it till an officer comes."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Did you see him go out before your daughter cried Stop thief? A. Yes - I saw him come and put a glass down, and while he was doing it my daughter cried out, "Mother, we are robbed" - he was not at all in liquor.</p>

            . I saw the prisoner sitting in the club-room, with a glass of porter before him. I afterwards saw him in the little parlour adjoining the club-room - there was no one there but him. There is a little cupboard on the right-hand side, in which the china is kept - I am certain it was locked at four o'clock in the afternoon; I found it open - the lock had been picked. After the prisoner was gone I went into the parlour, and he came out; he said nothing to me, but went into the club-room again, and put down two punch bowls, which he had taken out of the cupboard. I asked him what he was going to do; he said he wanted to go to the bar to get a glass of ale - he went to the bar, put the glass down, and went out of the house, and I went after him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not he say when you stopped him, "I am taking these things for a frolic?" A. No - he said, "What do you want with me? you have nothing to do with the house;" I said, "Have not I?" he then came back.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ on the 18th of July - I had previously employed him, when in Whitecross-street - on his coming out of there he came to me, and asked for work, and said if I would allow him to take the wood to his lodgings he could do more work, as he could get up at four o'clock in the morning. I gave him eighty-three feet of Cuba and Honduras wood; of what we generally call a peacock mottle - it was a log which had been opened under peculiar circumstances; he was to make it into Trafalgar nail-over chairs.

I know the prisoner well: I have looked at these chairs particularly, and if I had known I should have been called on to-day, I believe I could have brought a piece of wood from which the top of this chair has been made. I was present at the prisoner's house, when these things<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150086"/>were making, and he said to me "You see your stuff comes in useful now;" I said "What is this?" he said, "It is some wood of which I made some chairs for you some years ago. I made a couch," said he, "last week, and could not sell it, so I am making up these things, which are sure to sell, to get money." My wood was Cuba wood, and so is this; there is a resemblance between the chairs and this piece of wood produced, but I do not think it is the same: it would be a waste of Cuba wood to buy it to make these chairs of - but odd bits are used for them - workmen do sometimes keep small pieces which we call offal wood - we are not all so stingy as some people are.</p>

               <p>Prisoner.

I and two other persons were going across some fields; I had occasion to get over a hedge and saw this hod with a knife sticking in it; one of my companions said we will take it down the town, and if none of the bricklayers own it, we will sell it for a little beer; there were four bricklayers, and they did not own it; we then took it to the Rochester Castle public-house, and a carpenter came in and said "I have to make the top of a hod for a young man, and if you take it to him I think he will buy it of you.</p>

            . I am constable of Clerkenwell. I went with Miss Ross to the prisoner's lodgings, on the 20th of August, about eight o'clock, in the evening, at No. 8, Woodbridge-street; I found her at home, and told her I wanted her for a felony - and Miss Ross told her, she was suspected of taking some coppers from her room; she then kneeled down at the foot of the bed, and began to pull some Gilberts about, and said, "You see I have got none." I then took her back to the room, and in the very same spot in which she had kneeled down, I found 3 s. in copper-pennies, and 3 d. on her shelf.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not she say she was saving up 9 s., to pay her rent? A. Not then - but she did on the Monday morning.</p>
               <p>HARRIET ROSS re-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you at the office? A. Yes. Dymock's father said, his son had not a right memory, and did not wish him to be examined.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been with a bushel of apples, and had not sold them all.</p>

I then searched him, and found these shoes in his hat - he was very much in liquor.</p>

I have lived in that neighbourhood a year and a half.</p>

I saw the necklace round the child's neck; she took the child, and went out for a bottle of water - she staid about ten minutes, and then returned without the child; I asked where the child was, and she said she had not been with her - I looked out at the door, and saw the child without her beads; I said, "Oh! good God, Sarah, where's the child's beads?" she said she knew nothing about them. I then went about the neighbourhood - she went with me, and asked if any one had seen them, and she told me when I went home that I had better not say anything about them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Do you mean to swear to the man? A. I am convinced it is him, but still from caution, I do not swear to him - it was dark, but there were lamps, and I was near to one of them - I only saw him for a minute or two by the light of the lamps. I do not think I am mistaken with respect to this man - I could know him for seven years afterwards - I had supped with a friend, that evening, after I came off a journey from Bristol - I was not intoxicated - I had taken three or four glasses of white wine.</p>

I went to my desk, and took out of my pocket 1 l. 9 s. 6 d. in silver, which I put into a bag in a little drawer in the desk. I locked it, and went out. I returned about four o'clock, and found a letter from Worcester. I went to put it into my desk, and found it broken open. I called my head ostler and the prisoner, and asked if they had been out - they said No. I then sent for a gentleman, who advised me to wait till the evening. The prisoner was the last man who went out that night, and I stopped him. I said "You are the man who robbed me a fortnight ago; for which I discharged a young man;" he then began crying. I said "Where your coat?" he took it down, and in the pocket of it I found the bag with the 1 l. 9 s. 6 d.</p>

            . I am groom to Charles John Howard, commonly called Viscount Andover, son of Lord Suffolk. I remember these articles being packed up to be sent by Lord Suffolk's waggon; it was going near Malmsbury, in Wilts; it would go by Hyde-park-corner, down to Uxbridge; I delivered the portmanteau to Harrax, valet to Lord Andover; it contained the articles stated in the indictment; it left town on the 5th of July, and I saw the articles on the 6th in London; I followed the waggon, and overtook it about five miles on the other side of Maidenhead; the driver had not missed them.</p>

I asked them what they would take me to town for - I said I would give them 1 s., and they said jump up; when we got to Mitcham-street, two of them got down, leaving me and another to mind the cart; they said they should soon come back; they asked me to put the tickets into my pocket as we came through the turnpikes.</p>

I had a cane of satin of one hundred and thirty yards - I had cut off a number of yards at a time, as my master wanted it. On Wednesday, the 12th of July, I cut off ten yards, and left a remnant of seven or eight yards in the loom. I then took home the work, and returned in two or three hours. My master had not given me any shute, and I made a holiday that day and the next; and on the Friday morning I went to work, and found it rolled up in a different manner - I rolled it down again, while the prisoner was out, and found the mark which had been on my work was gone - some had been cut off. I went to a pawnbroker's, and found a yard or a little better.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going along the Quadrant; - this man said he saw me come out of the shop - if so why not take me before I got round the corner.</p>
               <p>RICHARD THOMPSON. I was so struck that I could not take him before.</p>

When I got up in the morning, I found the first floor window open; I had fastened it the night before: I missed the plate as stated in the indictment, out of the closet, mistress's watch from her drawer, a gold chain, tortoiseshell combs, nineteen handkerchiefs, four rings, and several other things.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CULL. I am a constable of Mary-le-bone. On the 12th of September, about a quarter past six o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in Lisson-grove, north, with a bundle under his left arm, and a red shawl swinging in his right hand; I ran after him, and got just before him about two yards, turned back and asked him what he had got there? he looked me very hard in the face, and said "What is that to you?" and made round a wall; I ran and collared him, took him to a public-house, searched him, and in the shawl were two large table and four tea spoons; I took him up stairs, searched the bundle, and found five combs, a silk handkerchief, nineteen white pocket-handkerchiefs, a pair of silk stockings, two white dresses, two silk dresses, a cruet and stand, and three salt spoons - the purses, some trinkets, and a gold watch and chain, were in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. After he was taken to the watch-house did not a person come and say they had seen a man come out of this house? A. No - When I asked where he got them he would not tell me; I shewed him my staff. I never heard him give any account of them, except telling the Magistrate that he pulled them out of a ditch. I met him in the public road, going towards the New-road. I found a miniature painting upon him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I arose at half-past five o'clock in the morning, and was walking in the Regent's-park before breakfast, intending to breakfast with my sister, at Bayswater. My attention was attracted by the bundle and articles in a ditch; I collected them together to take to the office to be claimed, when I was arrested by this man, in a rough manner, saying, "What have you there?" I said, "What is that to you?" judging from his appearance that he might be concerned in the robbery; he took me to the watch-house, and in three quarters of an hour a labourer was brought from the grove, to see if I was the person who had been seen coming out of this house - he said it was a much taller and stouter man; and in the lock-up room, in the presence of four people, one of the men said, I was a likely man to run; I applied to the witness to know if I had attempted to run; he said, No, but told the Magistrate I had turned round to attempt an escape. At the second examination the Magistrate spoke to him about this, and he said I had not run.</p>

The prisoners then came up behind me - Lynch took from my pocket a silk handkerchief, and gave it to the other prisoner, who put it under his coat. I collared Lynch, and said to him, "You villain, you have robbed me." Frewin ran into the crowd, I ran after him, and got hold of the tail of another man's coat - it rent the coat from top to bottom; and while holding the man's coat tail, I received a blow on the side of my face, or a kick - it stunned me; I fell on the pavement, and was taken into the shop of Mr. Saunders; the prisoners were gone then. When I first saw them at the corner of Gray's-inn-lane, they were with fifteen or sixteen others; I did not observe whether any of the others crossed; but I took particular notice of the prisoners, because they watched me, and I thought were after my watch, which I tucked up. I am sure Lynch is the person who took my handkerchief and gave it to Frewin. Lynch was taken in about five minutes, while I was in the shop, and Frewin about seven o'clock that evening. I knew them both, and pointed them out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen them before? A. Never; I felt Lynch's hand in my pocket, and saw my handkerchief in his hand; I was watching them for five minutes before it was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How came you to take hold of the tail of another man's coat? A. He ran into the crowd - they all three went together - I could not get through the crowd - I was too ill at the first examination to give my evidence - I did not hesitate for a moment to identify Frewin - I believe he had a blue coat on, but am not positive - my attention was taken up with his person - I did not speak to any woman - I called Stop thief! and the thief was stopped.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long had you an opportunity of seeing him by Gray's-inn-lane? A. For five minutes.</p>

            . I was standing in Baldwin's-gardens, on the 6th of July, about half-past six o'clock in the evening, and saw a young man run by me as hard as he could, and in a few minutes heard a call of Stop him! Stop thief! I and my nephew, Cambray, followed him - Cambray ran fastest, and caught him just as he ran into a house - I got up, and am sure he is the same person who was running - it was Lynch. I took him towards Holborn, where the hue and cry proceeded from, and in going along he said he had got money in his pocket, and would give it all to me if I would let him go - I said No, and asked what it was for - he said for an attempt to pick a pocket of a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were any other persons running? A. A good many were running after him, joining in the cry.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 6th of July I was at the office, and saw Frewin there. He called through the partition of the lock-up place, and said "Lynch, how do you get on?" Lynch said "I have not been up yet." I told Read, who secured him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Are you sure he used the name of Lynch? A. I am - I was six or seven yards behind him - he applied his mouth to a hole in the partition, and said so.</p>

            . I sell articles in the street. On the 6th of July, from five to nine o'clock, I was in Holborn; about five, as I came towards the Bar on the north side, I observed a man with a blue coat, fair complexion, and sandy hair, standing at the corner of Gloster-court, Holborn-bars; and as I drew on to Gray's-inn-gate, I stopped to speak to a person, and in a few minutes I turned round and observed the same young man struggling with Mr. Oram, with a silk handkerchief in his hand - it was not either of the prisoners. I have come here at the request of Frewin's mother - neither of them are the man.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you observe if any person had his coat torn? A. Yes; I saw that person run down Holborn afterwards - he is the man I saw with the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a crowd when he was struggling with Oram? A. Not at that time - they struggled in the centre of the street - there were persons on each side, whose attention was attracted - Oram and the man were struggling opposite Gray's-inn-gate, on the road - there was not a soul about them. I live in Bishop's-head-court, Gray's-inn-lane - I had come from Brook-street - I did not know Frewin before.</p>
               <p>- BUSHBY. I am the last witness's wife. On the 6th of July, a little before six o'clock, I was in Holborn - I saw a gentleman and a young man wrestling in the middle of the road; the young man had a silk handkerchief in his hand; he had a blue coat, light waistcoat, full face, light sandy hair, and was very fair, and sun freckled in the face; it was neither of the prisoners - the gentleman laid hold of the young man's coat, and in struggling he threw the handkerchief into the road; the gentleman tore his coat completely up to the collar.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Your husband did not offer any assistance? A. Yes, and the young man was taken - he asked to speak to the gentleman in the shop, and said, "Sir, you have no business to detain me;" he said, "Let us speak to the gentleman, and we will make it up;" he put his foot on the step of the door, turned out, and the people called Stop thief! the mob ran after him, and my husband followed. Lynch was then taken, and the crowd said he was not the man.</p>

I was called up to his room in four or five minutes, and when I went up I found the officer and one of our porters in the room; the officer had the watch; I saw him find the chain, seal, and key in one of the prisoner's pockets, and the opera-glass in the other.</p>

John Baptiste Pagliano. - Slade and Rudolph are the porters; they do not sit up at night; Louis, the water, sat up that night. I think the porter was not in the room the first time we searched; the officer could not have searched thoroughly; it was myself who suggested his going in again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done at the first search? A. Clements took hold of the coat; whether he put his hands into the pockets I do not know - I believe he felt the pantaloon pockets - whether he examined the bed I cannot say.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the prisoner any boxes in the room? A. No. The prisoner was up each time, and had his trousers on - he was washing himself the first time; his coat was upon a chair.</p>

            . I am a constable. On the morning of the 20th of August, I was fetched - I searched the two porters' rooms and their persons first, and all over the lower part of the house - after that, I went into the prisoner's room, he was up and partly dressed; Mr. Pagliano said, "Sir, there has a disagreeable circumstances occurred; there has been a robbery committed in the house;" the prisoner said, "I am very willing to go to Bow-street;" I turned down the bed clothes, could see nothing - I stooped down, felt in his coat pockets - I put my hand inside the pocket, and found nothing - I went out of the room with Mr. Pagliano, talked together, and not being<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150095"/>satisfied, I went into the room again; the porter went in with me - I had not left the room three minutes, and did not go from the bed-room door - no body could have entered without my seeing them - I went in first, the porter came in, and put his back against the door - I took the bed clothes off singly, and shook them, and between the second and third mattress, I found this gold watch - I asked the prisoner, if it was his, he said, No; his coat hung on the door where I had hung it before - I stroked it down outside, and found a hard substance in one of the pockets - I turned it up, and found the corner of the pocket tied up outside with a bit of tape - I untied it, and found the opera glass - I found the corner of the other pocket tied very tight, and there found the gold chain, seal, and key - I searched his breeches, pocket, and found three sovereigns, and some other money - I asked what he had done with the other three sovereigns, as the gentleman had lost six - he said, he dropped the other three going up stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you keep yourself in sight of the bed-room from the time of the first search to the second? A. I did - Mr. Pagliano did not stay with me - I told him to send one of his porters up - the porters could not have any thing about them when I searched them - he only stood by the door, to prevent his going out; he did not touch the bed - nobody was in the room the first time, but I and Mr. Pagliano.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the loss of the property - I gave my coat out to the porter to brush - he brought it up, and came into my room about six o'clock in the morning - the money found on me is my own.</p>
               <p>CHARLES PAGLIANO re-examined. The person who set up at night is not here - it would be either Slade or Rudolph's duty to brush the prisoner's clothes - Slade had to go to the Custom-house, that morning - he was before the Magistrate, but not examined.</p>

On the 17th of August, I received sixty sovereigns; I paid away thirty-four or thirty-five, and had the rest in a Scotch plaid bag, in my pocket; I was a little fresh in liquor, but perfectly sensible. On leaving the East India-house I went along Whitechapel, and bought two neats' feet and a calf's foot, which I put into a bundle handkerchief, and carried in my hand; I walked down Church-lane, and in turning the corner into Cable-street, my hat was taken from my head by a woman - it was about two o'clock in the afternoon; I called out "You hussy, bring me my hat;" I had never seen her before - she said nothing - I followed her up <placeName id="t18250915-257-crimeloc1379">Cable-court</placeName>

I think they said it was between three and four o'clock, when I came to my senses. I am sure my bag and money were safe when I was dragged into the house. I had made a purchase just before - I saw my bundle at the watch-house, with the handkerchief, and neat's feet in it. I am certain of the prisoners' persons - all of them. Holland had a hairy cap on, but in the course of the scuffle he appeared in a red cap, which he had on under the hairy one - I cannot swear which of the women took my hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Who had you drank with? A. A man named Farrier, in Little-Bell-alley, about half-past eleven o'clock. I drank part of two bottles of ale with him and another - I had a glass of gin and water; that is all I had that day; it was called Scotch ale - it made me a little fresh. I did not see three women till I got to the house - I was dragged in instantly,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150096"/>and was no sooner in than down - I resisted being dragged in at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Why not call for assistance? A. It is nothing but a den of thieves - I have discovered that since; it is about thirty yards from the main street - I could not have been heard - I was not half a minute at the door, before I was pulled in. I was terrified, but not so much as some people might be - I held the door-post as long as I could; I had no opportunity of seeing either of the prisoners, after I was pulled down; I am positive to all their persons.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you an opportunity of seeing them, while they were pulling you? A. I had - several times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. After drinking with the person, did you call elsewhere? A. Yes, at three places - but had nothing to drink.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HOLLAND. When the handkerchief was at the office, it was not torn. Witness. I produced it at the office torn in this state.</p>

            . I live in Cable-place, Cable-street; this place is called Cable-tier, or Long-alley - it is six or seven yards from the alley, to the top of Cable-court. On the 17th of August, near four o'clock in the afternoon, I saw Holland, and three girls going down the court - I knew two of them - they came out of Cable-tier - I saw no more of them after they went out to the main street. I saw Smith, who goes by the name of Kit Lips and Hall, who goes by the name of Davis, and another young woman, whose face I did not see; I heard Holland say to them, "Get on, or go on," he used an improper word, and said, "Get on, let the **** lay;" or something of that sort. Mrs. M'Ardell, came round the corner in a quarter of an hour, or ten minutes - and in consequence of what she said, I opened my yard-door, and went out into the waste ground, and there saw Randall lying on his back - a bundle lay at the back of his head in a belcher handkerchief quite torn, with cowheels, or neat's-feet, and cucumbers - his hat was nearly off his head - he was a few yards from the door of No. 21. I have frequently seen Smith, Holland and Hill, going in and out there. I always knew Hill, by the name of Davis. Randall lay there sometimes. A man of colour fetched Jackson from the watch-house; he appeared quite insensible, there was no movement in him. I know nothing of Edwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There were cucumbers in the bundle? A. Yes. I did not open it, but saw them.</p>

            . I live in Cable-court, and am married. I have seen all the prisoners, at the house where this happened - I do not know who lives in it. On the 17th of August, between two and three o'clock, I saw Edwards take Randall's hat off - she was at the top of the court. Randall was just at the end of the court, ten or twelve yards from the street; he followed her, and I saw him go into the house after his hat. I saw the three female prisoners go in at the door before him - and I saw him walk in. I stood at my door, which is three or four houses off, for more than half an hour, before I saw the three women go out of the court. I saw nobody with them - I then went by the door, and saw the prosecutor laying on his back on the ground in the room; I looked in, and saw Holland trying to lift him up - I said, "Dan, can't you lift him up?" He said, "Hold your tongue, he will get up by and by, let him be," or something of that sort. I went home, and afterwards saw Randall laying on the waste, at the back of my house; he was five or six yards from their house - and while he lay there, I saw Holland moving his things out of his own into another house. I am certain of the prisoners' persons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tell the Magistrate, you could not tell whether Hill or Smith, were two of the women? A. I do not know the names they go by - but they are the three women. I did not hear any noise in the house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Randall was ten or twelve yards inside the court when his hat was taken off; not in the main street? A. No, not in the street, there was no man with the three women when they passed me - they had time to go into the main street before Holland joined them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many rooms does the house consist of? A. I do not know - the room and street doors were open when I passed.</p>

            . I am married, and live in Cable-court, Cable-street. Holland lives at No. 21, Cable-court. On the 17th of August, between three and four o'clock, I went to the back of my house to take an apron in, and saw Randall laying at the bottom of the ground, near No. 21. I went to Mrs. M'Ardell, she came, and looked at him - he seemed dead. I saw Holland come out of the back door of No. 21, and drop a bundle near Randall's head - he went into one of the back doors again. I did not know Randall, and did not see further into it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not take the pains to see whether he was alive or dead? A. No.</p>

            . I keep a mangle in Cable-place. I and Hill went into the waste behind the house, and saw the prosecutor laying on his back, with one arm out of his coat. Holland came and put a bundle down about a yard from Randall, who was insensible. We made an alarm after Holland was gone, and the people came. I have known Holland three or four years, and I believe he lives in the court, but I do not know at what number - I have seen him lately at No. 21 - he has no family, but a parcel of women live there - the female prisoners live in the court, in different places I believe - I saw them up and down the court - I do not remember seeing Holland that day, except at that time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. On your making an alarm were you instantly attended to? A. Yes, persons came out of their back doors; the court is long, and goes sideways; I do not think a person calling out would be heard in the main street.</p>

Next morning, about three o'clock, I apprehended Edwards, and asked her how long she had left Cable-court; she said she had left it two or three months; I took her in Blue-gate-fields; I asked the landlady, in her presence, how long she had been there; she said not more than a fortnight, if so long.</p>

I was walking down Holborn and Chancery-lane; I turned towards Temple-bar; this gentleman knocked me down, and said I had picked a gentleman's pocket; I had never seen the handkerchief; and in ten minutes he brought this young man up, and said he was with me.</p>

               <p>MARGARET FURLONGER. I am a widow. The prisoner is my nephew, and visited me. On the 14th of July, a little girl came to me with a note, and I gave her this watch to deliver to my daughter; I found it in possession of a pawnbroker; the chain was not on it then. I live in Great New-street. I believe the letter to be the prisoner's writing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you read it you thought it your daughter's writing? A. Yes; I have received letters from the prisoner; I did not suspect it when I read it, but it is spelt the same as letters he has written to me. I apprehended him next day, and he confessed writing it.</p>

I know the prisoner; my father used to bring him to our house - he gave me this letter, and told me to say it had come from Mrs. Furlonger, at the White Swan; and told me to take it to Mrs. Furlonger, of Great New-street - which I did; she gave me the watch - he stopped at a public-house, near the house, and I gave him the watch - he gave me nothing - next day I was asked about it, and told how I got the note.</p>

               <p>"DEAR MOTHER, - I should be obliged if you will send Furlonger's watch; he has sent to me to get it repaired against he comes home; there is something the matter with yours - it don't go, but he will have it repaired before he brings it to you. He is very well, and sends his love - hopes this will find you well, as it leaves us at present. Please to send the watch by bearer.</p>

               <p>MRS. FURLONGER. The watch was my son's - he had mine, and I had his - he was gone to France, and we had changed watches. I thought by this letter that he wanted it back.</p>

               <p>CHARLES MUNNS. On the 28th of July, I was in Sydney's-alley. The officer came and asked me if I had had any thing taken from my pocket. I felt, and missed my handkerchief from my right-hand coat pocket. I had it about three minutes before - here it is; they had the prisoners in custody with it.</p>

            . About half-past eight o'clock on the evening of the 28th of July, I saw the prisoners in the courts leading from Leicester-fields to St. Martin's-lane, following a gentleman; the prosecutor came by, and they pressed up against him. I saw Cowden do something, and then put something into his breeches and go away - they then took to the left hand, and the prosecutor the right. I sent Reardon to tell the prosecutor, and took the prisoners into a public-house. I then took off Griffin's hat and found the handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Prisoner GRIFFIN. Q. I was not in company with Cowden? A. Yes, you was for a quarter of an hour backwards and forwards through the courts. I had seen them in Long-acre before they saw the prosecutor.</p>

I did not see them do any thing; but I saw them leave him at the end of the alley, and they turned off to Bear-street. I then went and told the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COWDEN'S Defence. I was coming from work. I saw something on the ground, and kicked it before me. I then took it up, and saw it was a handkerchief. I met this young man at the corner of Bear-street, talking to a woman - I shewed it to him, and he said he would give me a pot of beer for it.</p>
               <p>GRIFFIN'S Defence. I live in Stephen-street, Tottenham-court-road. I met a young woman, and stood talking to her at the corner of Bear-street; the prisoner came to me, and said he had found this handkerchief, which he would sell.

Harmer was in my employ, and Carter was there occasionally - in consequence of information, I went into my wash-house, and found some bottles which had recently had spirits in them - I left them there, and on the morning of the 29th, I saw Harmer and my son go down stairs - I followed them, and saw Harmer go back to the wash-house - I then heard Carter ask my son where Stephen was; he said, he was out backwards - I looked out at a window, and saw the two prisoners go out; I went down and looked about, and found a bottle of gin in the copper-hole - I went and asked my son, if Carter was gone - Carter heard me, and said, No, and asked me for a glass of gin, which I served him with - I then went and asked Harmer what was the cause of the bottle of gin being in the copper-hole - he said, he was very sorry for what he had done, but he had admitted Carter to sleep there, in consequence of his being locked out from home, and that Carter had gone into the bar, and drawn the spirits. I asked him if he knew of any more being concealed, he declared, he did not - but I looked about, and under some water-butts, and some saw-dust, I found six bottles more of gin, and three of rum - Harmer was present, and declared, in the most positive terms, that he knew not how they got there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. All you know of Carter is, that he went into the wash-house; and then called for a glass of gin? A. Yes, and all the rest I heard from the other prisoner in Carter's absence - I believe I had other lodgers in the house - Harmer and my son slept together, but my son is not here - I perhaps might have played at skittles with one of the prisoners for a pot of beer.</p>
               <p>MR. CRESWELL. Q. How many bottles did you put there to wash? A. I suppose about thirty - I suppose ten or twelve were left.</p>

I found the two brooches in the inside pocket of his coat.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I went into a house in the Seven Dials, where I met with this man; he asked me to go with him; I went and lived with him three days; he told me if I would live with him he would support me like a lady. On the evening in question he asked me to assist him down St. Martin's-lane; as we were going along he said he was about to take a room in King-street, Drury-lane; I told him I had an objection to that, and it was my intention to return to my brother, who is a Justice of the Peace in Dumfries; he went to a public-house, leaving me his basket to make what I could of it, and to get a yard of muslin, which I wanted; I waited from half-past seven o'clock till half-past nine; I then went home and told my landlady that I had got permission to dispose of the things; but on Saturday last the prosecutor came to the house and said he had got a letter from my husband, and he asked me to go home with him; I said I had no wish to live with him; he said "D - nation to my soul, I will either hang you or transport you;" he went out and got a constable.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM DRURY re-examined. Q. Had you ever lived with the prisoner? A. No, I never had any thing to do with her in my life; she came to my place one night about a fortnight before; I and my comrade gave her a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you ever permit her to raise any money upon your cucumbers or basket? A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell her you would be revenged on her, and transport her or hang her? A. No.</p>

            , who works in the gas-works, went with me on the evening of Monday week, the 12th of September, about twelve o'clock, I had missed my clock from my room that day - my son was with me, and directed me to the house - the door was open, and Watts was at home - I said "Ma'am, do you know this boy?" she denied knowing him - I asked her son, who was in the room, if he knew him - he said he did - I said to Watts you must know my boy, as he has been here selling a clock this afternoon - she said she did not know him. Welsh said, "Mistress, here's the boy's father who owns the clock: we don't want to hurt you nor the boy; all we want is the clock; and here is the three shillings for you which you gave for it." She said to my son, "You bad boy, you are not trusty, to come into my house after you have robbed your father; you told me you had picked up the clock over the water, on a gentleman's steps; did you not say so?" - he said he did. Welsh then said, "Mistress, give us the clock, we don't want to hurt you." She then asked if I would take payment for it till the next morning, and she would return it, as it was not then in the house, and asked if thirty shillings would do till she sent the clock home. The boy had said before, in her presence, that she had given him three shillings for it. I said I would not leave the house till I got the clock, or she sent for an officer to take me up. She then whispered to her own boy, and he said would not two pounds do till I got the clock back again. I said I would take no money; I wanted nothing but the clock. She then told the girl to bring a pen and ink for me to write the number of my house, and she would send the clock home next day. She then laid down sixpence for a pot of beer to treat us. My wife then came, and brought the watchman to take my boy and her. She said to my wife, "Go home, woman; and your clock is at home before you." I told her to go home, as we had made it up, and I expected to have the clock every moment. As we were going out she came and took hold of my arm, and said she was a lone woman, and begged me not to hurt her, and she would send it home the next morning. She whispered to Welsh to make it up with me - she then went away, and I thought she was going to fetch the clock. I remained there till after eleven o'clock, when my wife and another woman came to call me, but the prisoner did not return. Her boy asked leave to go out to look for her, and he did not return. The next morning my wife went to see if she could get the clock - the prisoner said she knew nothing about it - she did not buy it. She was taken into custody. I have never seen the clock since.</p>

When the boy came to offer the clock, my mother asked him where he got it - he said he picked it up by the Marshgate; she said if he had stolen it from any body, she would have nothing to do with it - she asked him that several times; she said clocks were plentiful, and cheap enough, but she would not mind giving him 3 s. for it - she was very ill at the time, and could not get up - the other boy did not come in. I saw him at the door, but my mother did not turn him out - I will swear that - it was the boy's uncle who sent for the porter - it was my mother's 6 d. which she put upon the table to pay for some cheese for supper; my mother did not say to them, that if 2 l. would do, she would give it them. Sullivan said he would make it up for 5 l. My mother did not offer a sovereign and 10 s., she had not a sovereign about her. I heard of the man kissing my mother, and wanting to sleep with her, and I was quite shocked at it. I do not know what my mother usually buys. I was at home at the time. I had left my service at a public-house, and was at home, but I do not know what became of the clock.</p>

I believe I was up last on the night of the 3d of August - I was as late as a quarter before twelve o'clock; the house was then secure every where, and my property was safe. My servant was up first next morning; one of my lodgers came and told me that my house had been broken open in the night. I came down and found the back door leading from the garden broken open - I believe it had been secure when I went to bed. I missed some spoons, some knives and forks, a tea-pot, a jug, and an apron, of my own property; two shoes and a desk, the servant's property, and two boots of Mr. Fairless, and one shirt of Mr. Matthews - that part of the property which was not my own, I do not know the value of. I afterwards saw the spoons shewn to me by the officers. I never saw either of the prisoners till they were before the Magistrate.</p>

I cannot say how the back door had been opened - it had been fastened with bolts the night before, when I went to bed; but it was open when I got up - the front kitchen shutters were open, and one of the windows thrown up. I missed the property which my mistress has described. I did not find any phosphorous, but found some matches which were not there when I went to bed - they appeared to have been lighted - some of them I swept up, and others I have taken care of. I am sure I fastened all the doors when I went to bed - the desk which I lost was worth about 1 l.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. I heard of this transaction about half-past five o'clock on the morning of the 4th of August. I went in company with Yates to a house in Higham's-buildings, Bluecoat-fields, and saw the prisoner Barton in bed undressed - two more men were lying on the bed dressed. The two men walked out of the room; and Ravenor who was also in the room followed them. Yates followed Ravenor and brought him back to me with his hat in his hand - he had hardly left the room a moment. I put my hand in the hat, and found a silver table-spoon, a tea, and salt spoon, and part of a metal spoon. I then searched him and found in his pocket a bunch of phosphorous matches. I asked him how he came by the property - he said he found it in Stepney-fields. Barton said "Here's a pretty job you've done for me." I asked Barton if he lodged there - he said Yes, and paid 8 d. a night for his bed. Yates then examined Barton farther.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CRESWELL. Q. What kind of a morning was it? A. It was light. I do not know whether it had been raining in the course of the night - it was dry when I saw the prisoners. Barton was undressed - the others went away.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went to the place in question, between five and six o'clock in the morning with Gray. I saw the persons in the room, and knowing two of them in particular I said "Gray its not all right;" I then saw a pair of women's shoes under the bed. The other two, whom I knew, then walked out - Ravenor followed them, and I said to Gray "I think there's something in that boy's hat," for I heard something chink. I then went after him, and took hold of his hat, and two silver spoons dropped out of it. I took him back to Gray, who took the rest of the property. I then searched the bed, and found an apron on the top of it, which has been identified. I then asked Barton what he had got in his pocket - he said, nothing he was afraid of. I searched his pockets, but found nothing relating to this. I asked how he came possessed of the shoes, and he said Ravenor put them under the bed.</p>

               <p>RAVENOR'S Defence. As I was going over Stepney-fields, I saw a bundle lay, and I took it up and opened it. I found the matches, these spoons, and an apron. Two boys called out, "That is ours." I said it was not theirs or it would not have laid there - they followed me, and I went to ask Barton to let me in, as it rained very fast.</p>

I saw her that morning, about nine o'clock, and asked her what she had done with the trousers and cap, which she took from my room. She at first said, she had not seen them; and then said, she had sold them. I said, if she would tell me where she sold them, I would not hurt her; she then said she had pawned them.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the examination taken down? A. No. This was when she was first charged with the offence - neither of the clerks were in the office at the time. In consequence of what she said I went to Mrs. Monck's, No. 77, Monmouth-street; I there found two pairs of stockings, and two pieces of flannel; I then went to Mrs. Winter's, and got a waistcoat and a shirt.

I had a time-keeper on the mantle piece - it was safe when I went out at six o'clock, in the evening of the 5th of September - I returned soon after one, and it was gone - a pane of glass was broken in the upper sash, fronting the fastening of the window - I know it was fastened when we went out, as my wife went to fasten it. I went on Hawkins' bed along with him, because there were two women in the house, who could not go to bed - I was sober - when we had been on the bed about three quarters of an hour, we heard a knock; he got up and went down - I do not know any thing else.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you go to amuse yourself at Bartholomew-fair? A. Yes; my wife is not here - the prisoner lived in the house with me, and he was at the fair, but I did not see him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not go away from the house? A. Yes, because I refused to let him in - I did not agree with him to come again the next day, but he said, he should call - he was sober, and so was I - I had had something to drink, he did not tell me he had been home tipsy, and had taken the time-piece in mistake, and was going to put it back again.</p>

On the 31st of August I had a black gelding, which I turned out in the Port Meadow - there were many other horses there, and I took particular notice of the marks on my gelding, that I might know him again. On the 2d of September I went to get it, and could not find it any where. I went in search of it for two days, and then heard that two suspicious characters had gone to Uxbridge. I saw an account in the paper, and went to Uxbridge on the 9th. I found my horse in the stable of the George Inn, and took him back. I did not see the prisoners till I got to Bow-street.</p>

            . I am a constable of Uxbridge. On the 2d of September, in consequence of information, I went to the George Inn, Uxbridge, and saw two horses standing in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150107"/>the yard - one was a black one. I asked the hostler where the man was who belonged to them - he said in the tap. I went to the tap with the man who gave me the information, and found the two prisoners there. I asked the price of the grey horse; May said 4 l. I asked if he would go in harness - he said Yes, he had worked him at Thane for four years. I then asked the price of the two horses together, and May said 14 l. I said "Let us go and look at them;" May, the man who gave me the information, and I, went to look at them. I said the black horse looks as if he had lain at grass. He said "Yes, I took him out this morning at four o'clock." I then went to Moore, who was in the house, and asked him how far they had ridden the horses - he said from this side Thane. I said, "Then you have been travelling all night - what time did you set off - at nine o'clock?" - he said Yes. I said, "Was it dark?" - he said Yes. I then went to the door and called May in, and said "I will see if I can deal with you." He came in - I said I had strong suspicions of their being stolen, and I should take them into custody, and detain the horses. I searched May, and found nothing on him - I found on Moore three spoons. I took them before the Magistrate at Hillingdon. Mr. Bowell saw the horses in my presence - the black one he saw was the one they had attempted to sell me. While they were in custody Moore said he knew nothing of the horses, but he was coming along, and that May asked him to have a ride.</p>

            , who had the horses with them. I intended to have come by the waggon to London, to get advice for my arm and leg, but I came with them; and just before we got to Uxbridge, they said they were authorised to sell the horses for 14 l. or 15 l., but they would not turn 14 l. away. Mr. Ingram saw the two men I had them from.</p>

I and my wife went out to market, about half past four o'clock, in the morning of the 2d of August - I left a widow woman, her son, and my child at home - I returned about a quarter before eight, but my wife remained at the market - I got the key into the lock, and opened the street door, but could not get it out again - I sent for a smith, who took the lock off, and got it out - I opened the front of the house, and took in some things off a waggon; my little girl went into the room, to put some play things on a shelf - she then came to me, and gave me information; I went into the room and found a small mahogany chest of child's drawers gone, which had in them some beads, some fishing tackle, and seven sovereigns, and some silver, and a pocket-book which had been locked in one of the drawers - I had seen the money and the pocket book safe the night before, but did not count it - it was safe that morning, before we went out, when my wife took some money to go to market with - I heard it chink in the drawer, but did not see it - I then missed some birds, and in a short time afterwards, a sieve of white currants. I sent my little girl to tell my wife, who came home and opened the large drawers, and found that they had been opened, and some things taken out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When did you see the prisoner in custody? A. I think about three weeks afterwards.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far were you from him? A.

On the 21st of August, I went, in company with Foster, and apprehended Robinson, in New Gravel-lane; there was a woman there, whom he called his wife - he said he wanted to go and speak to her - I saw him hand something to her - Foster immediately caught hold of her hand, and found it was three keys - I found thirteen duplicates, which she said, were her property, and a ticket amongst them of a pair of trousers; I asked her if they were her's;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150108"/>she said, they belong to a young man who had left them there; Robinson said, "Yes, they belong to an acquaintance of ours;" there was also a duplicate for a silk handkerchief, they were both in the name of Robinson - I then went to Coldecott's house, in Wentworth-street, and found a small chest of drawers in her room - I asked who they belonged to, she said to her - she opened the top drawer, and took something out to put it into her pocket - I took it from her, and found it was some fishing tackle, which she said a person had left there - I found some little beads in the drawers, and some duplicates in the name of Robinson.</p>

            . I was with the other officer. I saw Robinson, and said, "I want you;" he said, "Will you allow me to go up and speak to my wife?" he went up, and I heard something chink as he was giving it to his wife; I took hold of her hand, and found three keys in it - she said, "Do not hurt my child" - I said I would not.

               <p>JOSEPH JOHN HARRAD re-examined. Q. What size was the chest of drawers? A. About a foot high. There were two bird cages and a sieve of currants stolen - I do not think they would all go in one bag, or that one man could have carried them.</p>
               <p>ROBINSON'S Defence. A young man was taken in company with me, who was. I believe, a nephew of the prosecutor - he was suspected of robbing his uncle; after the second examination they had him out privately, to see what they could make of him, and promised him his liberty. The prosecutor told him he was his uncle, and if he told where the property was he would not give charge of him; we were then remanded, and the young man's mother went to the grandfather, and they made up among their friends 21 l., and gave it to the prosecutor, not to say any thing against the young man. When we went up again Lady Minto, as she is generally called, came up half tipsy, and said she knew I was the person, because I was so very much pock-marked - the Magistrate asked if there was any charge against the young man - they said, No, and he was discharged.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH JOHN HARRAD re-examined. Q. Was there any other person taken up? A. Yes: a young man named Goat; my sister married his father's brother - he was taken up on suspicion of robbing me, but I do not know where he is now; I have seen him since - he passed the door on the Saturday following; there was no such thing as any money made up. I do not know who took him up.</p>
               <p>COLDECOTT'S Defence. I keep a lodging-house, and used to buy bones and rags, and who comes in or out I do not know. The chest of drawers was brought in for 2 s. - 8 d. of the money was for an old man's bed, and 1 s. 4 d. I let them have.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Robinson a good character.</p>

On the 1st of September I went out and left the door ajar, and the gate of the front garden open; I went to the next house but one, and returned in about three minutes; I met the prisoner in the passage coming from the parlour - I asked him what he wanted - he asked me the way to Somers' Town; I asked if he went in to ask his way to Somers' Town - he gave me no answer, but ran away directly - I gave an alarm and so did my mistress.

            . I am a coal-merchant, and live in the Hampstead-road. I was in Arlington-street, and saw the prisoner running towards me - he then turned off, and ran towards the brick-fields. I pursued, and said to the brickmaker's who had caught hold of him - "Don't hurt him; let us go before a Justice;" the prisoner said, he had thrown down the time-piece; a boy picked it up, and gave it to me. I then asked him where the watch was - he said, he had thrown that away. I said, "I will not take your word;" I put my hand into his pocket, and found it there - the officer afterwards took it out.</p>

I had seen the prisoner two or three times near the window, before he took the lace; as soon as he had got it he ran off - I pursued him. I took him after he had got round two or three turnings - he immediately took a bitter oath, that he had not seen the lace, nor any thing of it, or any thing else, nor touched it. I then received a blow from some person, and the prisoner got away; I followed him to two public-houses. When he got to the second house, I sent for an officer - but he was not in the way. I then went back to the prosecutor's house, and took him, and Locke the officer, to the public-house where I left the prisoner - but he was gone. Locke took us to the house in Bridgewater-square - we met the prisoner and some others coming out - they all ran away - but the prisoner fell down, and was taken; he then confessed that had taken the lace, and sold it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 10th of August, I took Wilking into custody in Mr. Dale's kitchen, and asked what she had done with a table-cloth, if she had pawned it - she said No; but her mother had, and she believed it was at Mr. Aaron's, in Houndsditch. I went there with Mr. Dale, and found it - Bliss is her mother. I went to her house two or three times before she came home, and saw another daughter of her's who gave me a pocket-book, containing forty or fifty duplicates of property, which Mr. Dale identified. I took Bliss about four o'clock, and charged her with pawning property of Mr. Dale's; she said she was very sorry - she had done it through distress, and meant to redeem them again. I searched her, and found another pocket-book, with eight or nine more duplicates of Mr. Dale's property.</p>

            . I was attending Lord Westmoreland. His Lordship came out about half-past twelve o'clock - he came from the front door towards the gate; when I got to the gate I observed two carriages jammed together, in the gateway - an officer was called for - one came through the gate - he went to the front of the horse, with his staff in his hand, and desired both the coachmen to move back from the gate; he then took hold of the reins, and put them back. I cannot say whether he took hold of the reins of one or both carriages - one of them gave way, the other advanced on, rather furiously, at a fast trot; I did not see the coachman do any thing - there was hardly room to get out of the way, as the carriages came on in that way - I went with my back close against the wall - the carriage passed close by me, and struck the officer, who was on the right, and he fell; I went to his assistance, and found his leg broken - he was taken to St. George's hospital - the carriage passed within three or four inches of my feet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. The officer's right-hand, with his staff, would be in the direction of the carriage on the left of the gateway? A. Yes; I cannot say which carriage backed; if his staff was in his right-hand his left would be at liberty to seize the reins. I moved to the right hand going in - there are two gateways - this is the western one. I heard no intimation of the accident given to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Suppose the man, who backed, had been in the right line with a string of carriages behind, could he get back without endangering the carriage? A. I cannot say; I did not see the officer cling to the carriage pole.</p>

            . I am porter to Lord George Cavendish. On the 23d of May, between twelve and one o'clock at night, I saw two carriages in the middle gateway, which is the general entrance - there are three gates only - two were opened that night - the center is westward of the other - the two carriages were jammed together, and the coachmen were flogging their horses.</p>
               <p>Q. Were both flogging their horses or only one? A. I cannot say, but I observed the horses flogged - Lord Westmoreland came out, and desired the assistance of an officer, who tried to force them back - he tried to persuade them to go back to Picadilly - I did not exactly notice what he said - I saw him go towards the carriage, and persuade them to come in one at a time; one backed, the other came in with a rush, the officer was forced down - I stood at the end of the gate, the officer was down a little beyond where I stood four or five yards from the gate - I did not particularly notice in what way he fell; he was in front and fell; the carriage wheel went over him in a moment - it was Dawkins, whom Lord Westmoreland called up - I did not leave the gate to go up to him - I afterwards saw him taken away on a shutter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You did not go out to see the line of carriages? A. Yes; this was the proper gate to enter; I found two in possession of the gateway, one made way which liberated the other, and it came in and drove the officer on, he was down in a moment, he fell four or five yards from where the carriages were entangled.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the horses went forward of their own accord, on feeling themselves at liberty, you cannot say? A. No; it was certainly an accident.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What occasioned the accident? A. I do not know; I did not see him hang by the reins or the pole - I cannot say whether the horses forced him forward; he fell a little way beyond where I was - whether he held by the people or reins, I cannot say.</p>

I addressed them in a loud tone, saying,"For shame - you cannot both get in together;" I then exclaimed much louder, "You scoundrels - you will spoil your master's horses and carriages too." I was disregarded; or possibly not heard; they persevered in whipping, though they could not stir. I was very much cheered by the people, saying, "Bravo, Sir - we want some such as you;" I then exclaimed, "Constable - officer." Some one within the yard, whom I could not see, but took for an officer, called out "Put back, stand back" - both carriages then backed a little; one of the drivers renewed his whipping, and darted in furiously; I then heard a cry of, "A man knocked down, run over." The multitude closed on the gate-way, and prevented my seeing what had happened. I passed on, and further I depose not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You are a clergyman, and aware that this is a charge of murder? A. Yes. I was a voluntary evidence before the Coroner. I was returning from dining in Burlington-street. There might be one or two hundred carriages; they were not in a line: both the men whipped furiously up together. There was no line within my view.</p>
               <p>Q. That you swear - I give you notice there are two or three witnesses to contradict you? A. There was no line near the gate - none within my view - there were carriages behind these two, but not very close; they were so close as to preclude my venturing to pass behind them, for fear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150112"/>of being run over - there was a continuation of carriages, reaching to St. James's, but not in a straight line - I cannot say which carriage had the priority - both drove up together - I was standing on the side of them, not within the gate-way - I think the horses had got within - the wheels were locked.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how could you see them whip their horses with the wall on your side? A. It was very light, moonlight. I was between the fore and hind wheel, on the side next the Arcade. I could see the coachmen, for they stood up to whip; the wall is too high to see over; one carriage put back, and the moment there was room for one, he whipped his horses and darted in.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see them whipping distinctly? A. I did; I did not think he could have got in, the other backed so little; one backed more than the other, which admitted the other to dart in; there was room for one to back.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing that both backed a little to get disentangled, was it not the most prudent course for one to go forward? A. I suppose when one found room he should have gone forward, and did so.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had not driven furiously, and gone in without whipping, was it not proper for him to go in? A. Yes, according to my judgment - no foot passenger could pass till he had gone in.</p>

            . I am an officer of Marlborough-street. I was on duty on this night, at Lord George Cavendish's, to preserve order with the carriages. I heard a noise between twelve and one o'clock, and went down to the centre gate, where Dawkins lay with his back against the wall, and his leg broken - he was on the left side of the gate going out. I went with him to St. George's Hospital, and next morning went to Lady Lambert's stables and apprehended the prisoner. I told him I had a warrant against him for running over a man at Burlington-house last night. He said he recollected driving against a man, but had no idea that the wheel ran over him. I told him the man's leg was broken, and he was in the hospital - he said he was extremely sorry to hear it. The carriages should have been stationed with their horses' heads towards Hyde-park, and not to come in till called - that is always the regulation in that place.</p>

Nicholas Dawkins was my brother; he was fifty-five years old - he was an officer of Marlborough-street; I visited him daily in St. George's Hospital - I believe he lived nearly twelve weeks - he said, full two months before he died, that he knew he must go, and that he was a murdered man. The night before he died, he said he must go, that it was all dicky with him - that if the coachman had pulled up in a proper manner, he might not have been run over, if he had not whipped on so; he said so a fortnight before he died, and the night before also - he was aware that he should not recover - he said he went down by Lord Westmoreland's order, to avoid the carriages coming in in that manner - that he got them to back a little, and Lady Lambert's carriage whipped on - that he laid hold of the pole and reins, and down he fell, and the fore and hind wheels went over his legs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At one time the surgeons considered him out of danger? A. I understood so - he died of a fever.</p>

In May last, I remember Dawkins being brought to the hospital; he had received a compound fracture in the right leg; he was attended to immediately, and went on favourably till the 3d of June, when he was attacked with erysipelas, caused by the fracture; it extended up the leg and thigh, and terminated in the formation of an abscess, which was opened, as occasion required - there was a great discharge - his constitution suffered very much - he died on the 11th of August.

               <p>CATHERINE SWEENEY. I am the wife of John Sweeney, and knew the prisoner before she was a year old.

I was coming home, and met the prisoner with

            ; she asked me to go and drink a pot of beer - I said I would not. I had left my husband in the public-house; she and the two men wanted me to go and have the beer; I refused, and Brown said I must go, and put his hand round me - I said I must go home. The prisoner came and put her hand under my arm, and said I must go; I went with her - she took me across the road, out of my own road, and by the water; she wanted me to go into a public-house; I said, "Goggen, I won't go into the public-house to night;" she said, "We shall both get home sooner by going this road than the other, because we can cross the fields" - she went to a public-house, and called for a pot of beer at the door - it was refused her, as she owed for some. I said, "Goggen, you have had too much liquor" - upon which she struck me a blow in the face; she turned round to the two men, who were standing behind us, and talked to them - I heard them whispering, thought there was something bad going on, and went away, and when I got into the fields Goggen called me, and said she would be with me; I waited in the field for her till she came to me - the two men came after her - she turned and talked to them - I ran away, and the first words she said were, "There, she is gone;" then the three followed me. I was knocked down by Brown - he fell himself at the same time - I was not long enough with them to know whether he was drunk or not; I was sober. I got up; I had the key of the street door in my hand, and when he came close to me to catch hold of me, I struck him in the face with the key - I got up before him; he caught hold of my pocket, tore my gown, and took the key of my box and two sovereigns out of my pocket - Sullivan came directly, and took my shawl; he whipped it off, and took it to Goggen, who stood about three yards off.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you try to prevent his taking it? A. No; I did not see him till he pulled it off - because I was struggling with Brown. Goggen said to Sullivan, "D - n you, why don't you take the gold ring off her finger" - he came back, and knocked me down - and took the ring and beat me; I was more than half dead - he left me there. I would rather have lost the last drop of my blood, than he should have the ring. I resisted, and would not let him have it until he knocked me down, and took it and the key of the door away - all this was in the field. I went back to a man named Charley Brian. I was more than a quarter of a mile from home, and thirty or forty yards from the public-house. I went to Brian, he was in bed. Next morning I went to Goggen's house, and asked what was the reason she took and robbed me, along with two men, and why she went drinking with men, whom she did not know; she said, she would drink a pot of beer with any one who would pay for it. She said she did not know the men, but I have since found out that they lodged with her. She sent for me the same evening, and said she would give me my property up before to-morrow evening - but did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this, had you told her she had better confess? A. I do not know what I told her - I was really out of my mind - I was three weeks in bed - I have found none of the property. I advised her twenty times over to give up the property, and if not, I would make her. I told her to give me my own, and bring the robbers up - she said she would not give Pat Brown up, if she was twelve months in Newgate. I said, if she did not give the property up, I would put her where she would not get out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. What business is your husband? A. A poor labouring man; he worked at the gas-works, or wherever he could get work. I go out with apples and fish.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of night was this? A. Between eleven and twelve o'clock; the public-house, is the Eeel-pie-house by the canal, in the Merchants'-field - if I had screamed out, nobody could have heard me. I did scream and call murder. I knew the prisoner, but did not know where she lived. I went to her at six o'clock the next morning; a neighbour told me where she lived. I went to Lambeth-street about three days after, and had a warrant for Brown and Sullivan as well, but they were not taken. I had known them for two years, they are bricklayer's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150114"/>labourers. I went before the Justice, who dismissed the charge - I did not speak much against the woman, because she had promised me my property. She took my shawl, and I told her to give it me up, when I went in the morning. I went to Hicks's-hall, and preferred this bill, and then had her taken again, as the Justice told me to indict her.

I did not see Brown. I left them talking to her at the corner of the street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At what time of night did your wife come home? A. Not till seven o'clock in the morning; she said she was robbed by Goggen, Brown and Sullivan; that the prisoner decoyed her out of her way - it happened in the centre of a field, which is a thoroughfare - there are no watchmen; she could not be heard if she called out - the place is noted for robberies.</p>

On the 27th of July, at six o'clock in the morning, I came down stairs, and found the shop door open - it was fastened the night before. I could not find him in the house. I had seen him go to bed the night before; he usually opened the shutters, which was not done. I missed this property, and found the watch in pawn. I waited at Mr. Laws, West-street, Smithfield, from seven o'clock till half-past five, when the prisoner came in with a bundle. I asked what he had done with the property he had taken - he did not tell me; he had got my hat on, and had left his own behind. I said he was not going out till the officer came; he went backward to the privy for ten minutes, and was just coming out when the officer came, and found on him, a pair of trousers, two aprons in a bundle, and a half handkerchief in his pocket - a duplicate was found in the privy.</p>

I said - "You have got some very nice pigs there;" he said<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150116"/>Yes. I went and informed the officer, and returned to the pen with him, and asked the prisoner what he wanted for the pigs; he said 5 l., or guineas, I do not know which. I offered 4 l. He said he could take no such money, for they cost him more. I then gave charge of him. He said he had bought them at Brentford, and did not take sufficient notice of the person to describe him; they looked very thin, but were not much altered.</p>

He said there was another person with him, who saw him buy them.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On the morning of the 3d of September, I saw the desk, about eight o'clock, standing on a table in the front parlour, and a bird-organ standing on it; about one o'clock, I was cleaning the passage on my knees, and saw a man go out of the door and along the garden towards the Thames; he walked across the Green, and got to the path - he had on a black coat and dark trousers; he was about the size of Croft. I did not see any other person about the premises; soon afterwards, in consequence of what my mistress said, I went to the parlour, and found the door bolted on the inside; I got in at the window, which looks towards the garden; I found the little organ standing on a chair by the window, and the desk gone; I gave an alarm to Brown, who lives next door, and then went over to the counting-house to my master.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. How far was the person from you when you first saw him? A. I do not think he was more than twenty yards. I think it was a black coat he had on - I only saw one person.</p>

            . I am in the employ of Messrs. Cook and Co. the distillers. On the 3d of September, I went to dinner at one o'clock; I passed the door of Mr. Biggerstaff - I saw the two prisoners near there; Croft had a black coat on, and some crape on his hat: he had dark cord trousers on; he was sitting on the rails at the front of the house, and Sullivan was by him, with his hands full of apples; he had a blue jacket and trousers, and a seal skin cap; they had a piece of green baize by the side of them, but no desk; I went back in about twenty minutes; I met the two prisoner's again, and Sullivan had a desk on his shoulders, half covered with green baize, but I could see all the back part of it; it shut up in three pieces, and was bound round with brass, and had a brass handle at the end; neither of them spoke to me; they were coming towards Westminster; I saw Mr. Biggerstaff directly afterwards - he said he had lost a writing desk - I told him what I had seen.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you stop them to examine the desk? A. No; but I could see very plainly that it shut up in three pieces. I stopped and looked at it; Mr. Bickerstaff had not told me that it shut up in three pieces, till I told him what I had seen; I saw the end of it, and half way along it - I did not stop it because I had no knowledge of whose it was.</p>

            . I live at No. 3, Vauxhall-road, with Mr. Kendall, an oil and colourman. I was going to Mr. Smith's, on the bank, on the 3d of September, and saw the prisoners at Johnson's-place, about half-past one o'clock, about a quarter of a mile from Mr. Biggerstaff's - they were going towards the Vauxhall-road, in the way to Westminster. I knew Sullivan - he had a small mahogany desk on his shoulder - the green baize had slipped off it, and hung on his shoulder - the desk was partly open - it had bits of brass round the corners. I did not say any thing to him, as he was on the other side - he had a young<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150117"/>man by his side, and I thought he was carrying the desk for him - I cannot say who it was, as I did not take notice - they turned round by Mr. Lewis', the market gardener's - he put the desk down on the ground, and covered the green baize over it again - when I got to Mr. Royal's, the boat-builder's, a man made some inquiries about it, and I stated what I had seen. Some person came to my house the same afternoon, and I went to Queen-square. Sullivan had a blue jacket and trousers on, and a seal-skin cap. I saw him again at the watch-house on Sunday morning - he then had a long white coat on, and an old hat. I went to Queen-square to give evidence on the Saturday afterwards. A strange young man came up to me and talked with me; and Sullivan came and said he would give me a shilling if I would say it was not him.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I apprehended Croft on Saturday night, the 3d of September, in Peter-street - he was then dressed in a blue coat and dark trousers. I found this bit of crape in the crown of his hat, folded up, and pinned with black pins. I have seen him wear black crape on his hat of the same width as this. I asked him where he had been all day, and he said at his mother's. I asked where that was - he said at No. 52, Duck-lane. I went there, but could not learn that he had been there. I afterwards asked if he knew Sullivan - he said he did not. About one o'clock on Sunday I apprehended Sullivan, secreting himself in Mr. Sullivan's premises, the boat-builder, at Millbank - he had got over the garden pales, and was behind some articles on the premises. I asked if he knew George Croft - he said No, he did not. I asked him again, and he admitted that he did know him, but had not seen him for three months. Sullivan had the same coat on then as he has now, and a black hat. I knew both the prisoners before. I found at Croft's lodgings a letter signed "George Croft." A girl of the name of

I told him not to let any thing go off the premises on any account, as I would prosecute the first person I found taking any thing, having been a loser before. I had occasion to take the prisoner before a Justice, for leaving his work (I think on the 1st of September) and after that some discoveries were made. I had had no suspicion of him before. I had had things hinted to me, but I did not know the person.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had not the young man been some time in your employ? A. Yes - he employed a person under him, whom he turned away, but I did not oblige him to do so; I believe he did so by keeping part of his money back - he told me he turned him away because he was not able to earn the money he charged me for him. I had not requested two men to take the prisoner's place, and said I would turn him away before I had him before a Magistrate - I there charged him with leaving his work; the case was heard by the Magistrate - I believe it was not dismissed. Mr. Twyford asked me, when I went again, whether I would go into the higher charge. I swear I never heard the Magistrate say "I don't like your turning round in this manner, and preferring another charge when you find the first won't do." I saw Mr. Harmer there. The prisoner went to Clerkenwell for some days, and was then admitted to bail. When I went to make the first charge against him I did not know of this. I think he left my service on the 29th of August, and I think I made the charge on the 2d of September, but I cannot be certain, unless I had my book here. John Provan had left my service about three weeks before Russell did. I did not state at the office that Provan had told me Russell had robbed me - I said he had hinted that some one was robbing me, and I thought it was Russell.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you employ Provan, or did Russell? A. He did; I had nothing to do with him at all, but to pay him his bills. I had no distinct information as to carry conviction home to the prisoner, before I took him to the Magistrate. I gave directions to have my property better watched, and it was after that I received this information. Kearney is the person I set to watch.</p>

I saw the prisoner and the apprentice take away fifteen or sixteen of the mitre strings of the stair-case, at breakfast time, one day in August last, but I cannot recollect when. I sat on the bench, eating my breakfast at the time, but I did not say any thing, as I thought they were fire wood. On the next day, which was a Wednesday, Mr. Trott sent me to work in Aldermanbury.

I told him I meant that nothing should be taken away, and I would prosecute him as well as another who took it.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JOSEPH CLIMPSON. Q. Were these little bits of any use but as fire-wood? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Were they not of use to Mr. Trott? A. Yes, as fire-wood. I would not give a halfpenny for three of them. I never saw the prisoner do it but once; there was no person present but him and me.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the evening of the 22d of July I saw the three prisoners in company in Leadenhall-street. I followed them to Mr. Kipling's shop. Butler had this bag in his hand. When they got to the corner of Queen-street they remained there some time - then went up Bow-lane and returned, and went into a shop three or four doors before they came to Mr. Kipling's. They then looked at another shop - a boy came out and looked at them. Butler and Kemp then went into Mr. Kipling's shop. Sullivan took the stockings from the door, and put them into the bag, which he rolled up under his arm, and crossed the road - I followed, and took him - I got assistance to secure him, while I took the other two.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you go into the other shop which they went into? A. Yes, and they had bought there a pair of stockings. which they paid for - I searched Kemp and Butler, and found the stockings.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN'S Defence. I was going to Fleet-market to meet my brother. I saw this parcel of stockings lying on the ground. I took them up, and put them into my bag. The officer came and took me. I had never seen them others before.</p>
               <p>KEMP'S Defence. I met Butler, he said he was going to buy stockings, and asked me to go with him, which I did; he gave two shillings and sixpence for them. When we came out, I said, "You want a pair of braces, you have forgotten them;" we then went into this shop to buy them, and gave one shilling for them; while we were there the gentleman came and took us.</p>
               <p>BUTLER'S Defence. I met Kemp at the corner of Castle-street, Whitechapel. I said I was going to buy stockings and braces. I went and bought the stockings, but forgot the braces till I got out of the shop. I then went into Mr. Kipling's to buy them, and was taken - but I know not for what.</p>

I was going out about six o'clock, and asked her to go up stairs; she said I will do no harm in your room. I went out, and returned in three quarters of an hour. I found the place stripped of every thing. I have seen some of the things since, and some of them are here now. I did not see the prisoner for twelve months - she then came down to Billingsgate.

I was in that slope on the 4th of July, about a quarter past four o'clock. I could see plainly into the stable - there was nobody there but the prisoner. I saw him go to the mare next but one to the window, and put the handle of the fork up and down in her body for a few minutes; he then went to the one next the window, which was lying down; he hit her, and made her get up; he then poked the handle of the fork up her body, and did it up and down.

            , while the prisoner was doing it, and he saw it; there was a lad named Davis there sweeping the steps, and Ray went and told him - he came, and saw what was doing; soon after Davis's mother called him away, and Ray went away too. I stood in the ride, and saw the prisoner do the same then to a black mare; he came up and went to a privy, and then went away out of the ride. I went down to the stable in about half an hour afterwards, while the farrier was there. I saw the stall where the mare was which he had first served so - it was lying down, and its tongue hanging out. I saw the second mare sweating very much.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRENDERGAST. Q. Had you not been there, and been told to go out? A. Yes, the foreman told me to go out. The prisoner did not whip me on the Sunday before - we did not say that in consequence of his whipping us we would have something done to him. I know it was the handle of a fork, because I saw the iron in his hand. The stable is dark, and I was at the top of the hill, a great deal higher than the prisoner. As you go down there is a grating in the floor of the coach-house. I have never seen candles used there in the day-time. I saw him poke the handle first into one, and then into another horse. It is a street where many people are passing - we did not speak to any people, but told Davis of it, and he would not believe it - this was while it was doing. I did not tell any person he was killing the horses - I did not know he was hurting them. I mean to say, upon my oath, that it went into the horses - it did not go under them - they were standing with their tails nearest to me - I did not see any blood come from them - I was too far off to see that - it went in at the back of the horses. I told

             was doing something to the horses. I did not say he was running the fork into them, because I did not know he was hurting them - I thought he was doing them good - we did not call on any one to stop it.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Could you see the people go by in the street? A. No, not till I got to the top of the hill.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did you tell Thomas Davis? A. It was Charles Ray that told him first. I said "Here is Short doing something to the horses," and he said "Gee up."</p>
               <p>CHARLES RAY. My father is a watchmaker. On the day in question I went to the cistern to get a drop of water - it is opposite to the slope of the stable. Windsor called me to see what the man was doing. I went to the top of the ride, but did not go down. I plainly saw the prisoner in the act of pushing the handle of the fork into the body of the mare, which was second from the window. He had hold of one prong in one hand, and his other hand was on the handle, and he worked it backwards and forwards. I do not know how long he was with that mare. He then went to another mare next the window, and worked the fork backwards and forwards in her body - I am sure the handle of the fork was in the body of the mares. There was a boy of the name of John Davis sweeping the stairs, and I beckoned to him to come and see it - there was a man who asked what we wanted. I and

             went and told Thomas Davis what we saw - he was busy, and did not pay particular attention to it - he said "The fork, is he?" and went on with his work. I went and looked a bit longer, and then went home. I did not see any one else in the stable.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Windsor go to Thomas Davis? A. I do not know; I saw him standing at the top - I had seen the prisoner two or three days before; I was going to the cistern on the Sunday before, and he gave me a thump with a broom, but did not hurt me; I did not tell the people, who were going by, because I did not exactly know whether it was cruel or not, or I would. I mean, upon my oath, to say, I did not know that he must be injuring the horses; I told Thomas Davis "Here is Short putting the handle of the fork into the mare's body;" he said "Sure," and went on with his work; I did not call out to the prisoner; the stable is not very dark - it is light enough to see what any one is doing; I do not know of candles being used there in the day time; the light comes from two windows in the street, and some grating in the coach-house; I was the length of the stable from the light; there was no conversation between me and the other boys as to what we saw him doing; I am sure it went into the mare's body, under the tail; I was not there when he went away; I left Windsor and Davis there - I went home but did not tell any one about it.</p>
               <p>JOHN DAVIS. I am sixteen years of age next July. I was at the Bull and Mouth, sweeping down the steps facing the Oxonian stables; Charles Ray called me - I went just to the beginning of the stable, and saw James Short with a pitch-fork in his hand, which he was forcing backward<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150122"/>and forward into the mare's body, which was the second from the window; we all came away together, and then went down again in about a minute; I saw my father there, when I came up a second time, cleaning a horse in the yard; the two boys came with me, and Charles Ray went and told my father - he called me to prove what he said.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did not you think he was hurting the horses? A. No, we came up and laughed at it; I did not call to any one to stop it; I did not tell my father but the boys, Charles Ray and Joseph Windsor, told him. I do not know whether they went separately to him - my mother called me to go to my place.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DAVIS. I am hostler at the Bull and Mouth. I was working in what is called the ride, over the Oxonian stable; my son and Ray came to me, and said something, but I did not go down to the stable then; I went in about an hour, when the farrier's man said something to me. I saw a mare lying dead in the second stall from the window, and the next one to her, under the window, was in a dangerous state; I took her out of the stable to Mr. Surman's; she was in a great perspiration; it is light enough in the stable to see without candles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. A. Do you know the grating? A. Yes, it is not far from the place where the mares stood; I should think the face of a man could be seen distinctly from there - the stable is rather dark at all times - a candle is used sometimes in dark foggy days in the winter; a person could have seen a man at the distance of the end of the stable, in fine weather. I was told of it by two boys, but not by Windsor; Ray said the man was using the fork about the mare's body, but I did not believe it; he made me understand that the handle of the fork was in the mare's body.</p>

            . I am one of the foremen of the stables. The proprietor is Mr. Edward Shearman. I went down into the Oxonian stables, and met the mare coming up in great agony; I found in the further stall but one, a mare lying dead; I do not think the two could be replaced for less than seventy guineas. I ordered them all up, as I thought it might be from heat; I went for Mr. Surman, our veterinery surgeon; he attended the mare, which was alive, but it died in about an hour - I saw a great quantity of blood.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had not the prisoner returned himself to the stable? A. No. The constable came and took the fork from the stable; I know it to be Mr. Sherman's. It had been used by the prisoner; the handle appeared as if it had been wiped; the prisoner was generally away from two o'clock until about six, but that depends on circumstances.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DAVIS re-examined. Q. Did you see the prisoner about the stable, at the time you received the information? A. No; not until the alarm was given about the death of the first mare. I had seen him in the morning, and again in the evening after he was taken; I do not know whether he had returned to the stable or not.</p>

            . I am hostler at the Bull and Mouth. On this afternoon I went for the prisoner, about five o'clock, in consequence of what was said about the horses. I found him on the bed at his lodgings, in Golden-lion-court. I said, "James Short, do you know one of your horses is dead?" He said, "You do not stand that, do you." I said, "It is very true." He said "It cannot be, surely, can it?" I then came out, and never saw him after I left the room; he did not appear to be drunk. I went to let him know of it as an old servant; no one sent me - he is generally away from the stables from two to six o'clock.</p>

            . I am a veterinary surgeon, and am employed at the Bull and Mouth. In the month of July, a blind mare was brought to my shop - I was not there at the time - she died in about an hour in great agony. I then saw another mare which was dead - I opened them, and found the bladders of each of them divided, and the urethra much inflamed, which no doubt would have been produced, by putting the handle of a fork up the urethra. It was from no disease, it must have been done by mechanical means - there was a great deal of blood inside.</p>

            . I am a constable. I took the prisoner into custody on the 8th of July, between five and and six o'clock. When he was at the Compter, I found one of his shoes with the upper leather all bloody. I found a pitchfork in Mr. Stubbings's room, the handle was to a certain length stained with blood, but it had been wiped.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. When Beteridge came to me, I got up and went down to the stable. I saw Stubbings there. I went immediately to the mare, and would not believe any thing of the kind; I put my hand on her, and during her plunging about, some of the blood came on my shoe. I knew nothing of it until I got to the court, and then one of the book-keepers was taking down the names - he looked down and said, "What is that on your shoe?" He took it off - and that was the way it came so. The stable was always open - any person might have gone in, there is no door to it. I never had a blemish in my character.</p>
               <p>Three witnesses gave the prisoner a good character.</p>

Last Thursday night I was down in the cellar with three of our men - we heard some one in the shop; I went up, and found the prisoner, who was a stranger; he had got the roll of floor cloth from the place where it was, and removed it about half a yard - he was endeavouring to put it on his shoulder; I closed the gate which had been left open, and asked what he was going to do; he then begged hard for mercy, and said he had come from Birmingham, and left his parents.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Might he not as well have thought of putting St. Paul's upon his shoulder. A. I should think not quite; he said, before the Magistrate, that he came by the desire of a friend, to make a purchase of some floor cloth; the roll consisted of twenty-seven yards - he was endeavouring very hard to get it on his shoulder; it is a load for any person, it weighs about one hundred pounds - it would have been madness for him to have attempted to carry it.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in the cellar? A. About a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes - it was safe when I went down, and when I came up, he was attempting to put it on his shoulder.</p>

               <p>THOMAS BARKER re-examined. Q. Did not the prisoner state, when the charge was made, that he wished to be taken to a friend, for whom he had looked at this oilcloth? A. No, at that shop, he said nothing, but when we got to Mr. Mitchell's, he said he hoped he would forgive him, and he wished to speak to him in private, but Mr. Mitchell said, "What you have to say, say;" he then said, I have been obliged to abscond from my friends at Birmingham, through having a bad disorder, and I wanted to get something that I might go home to them."</p>

On the 22d of July, about two o'clock in the afternoon, I saw the prisoner with two other men about the house, and sometimes at the corner of Basinghall-street - I continued to watch them till about five o'clock, I was then about to leave the shop to go to the parlour, when I turned my head and saw the prisoner taking the cotton - I lost six pieces; I ran into the street, and saw him endeavouring to cover it with his apron - he turned up Moor-lane; I afterwards saw a gown on the back of the woman he lives with, made of some of the same cotton - he was taken on the 2d of August - when he committed the robbery, he had a fustian coat like a shooting jacket on, and a leather apron with a bib to it. I had observed him about the house previously to that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. Were there not three who engaged your attention? A. Yes, the other two had blue coats on. I particularly observed the prisoner - he was dressed different to the others. I have not said that the gown I have seen is not to be bought in a shop in London. We buy our cottons in Queen-street, and I do not know how many thousand pieces of the same cotton<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150124"/>may be sold. I was the only person in the shop that day, and was not out the whole afternoon. I was watching the shop, as I have been robbed four times since Christmas, in a very audacious manner. I did not see the prisoner have a double-barrelled gun and a little pointer with him. We have not tried to make up this matter. I have not seen him but in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you correct in stating that you had seen the prisoner, and two others about your house in the course of that day? A. Yes - I said when the prisoner was taken up that he was the man.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. On the day of the robbery I was at work with my father. Her husband stated at the office that he had lost three pieces, and she comes and states she lost six - it is not likely I could steal one hundred and sixty-eight yards of cotton and run away with it.</p>
               <p>CATHERINE BATES. The property was taken as near five o'clock as possible, on the 22d of July. I did not see the man who took it till he was apprehended - the apron was not then produced.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How was the cotton taken? A. He came into the shop, and took it from a pile at the right hand of the shop - they were tied flat and close in different ties, squeezed tight on one another.</p>

The prisoner came to our shop about four o'clock in the afternoon of the 22d of July - there was another woman with her - they wanted a waistcoat pattern; the other woman went to the outside of the window, and pointed to some which I shewed them. I then missed a piece of kerseymere from the counter, which had been lying about half way on it. I do not think the prisoner moved from the counter while the other went out. I felt timid, and did not say any thing to them; they went out of the shop without buying any thing, and I followed; they got to a turning, and I saw the piece of kerseymere at the bottom of the prisoner's gown. I caught hold of her with one hand, and drew it from her; she said "I picked it up." - I was very much confused, and do not know whether I said any thing to her or not.</p>

When we got to the shop, the lady was playing with an infant on the floor - my child was cross, and the young child on the floor attracted my attention, and I played with the two children. In the mean time I suppose it was the other young woman who took the piece; the lady pursued us, and the young woman dropped the parcel at our feet.

            . I am the prosecutrix's daughter. I had cut off some linen for my brother's shirts; I do not know what quantity, but I saw that some had been cut off, by its being cut and folded differently to the way I left it - I then looked for a pin which I had left in it, for the length of the sleeves - that was gone, and a corner was cut off; there were about three yards of the cloth gone. My mother then inquired of the prisoner, and the other servant, who both denied it; my mother then said, "To end all dispute, you had better produce your boxes;" the other servant opened her's first, and then the prisoner opened her's and took the piece of cloth in her hand; my mother said, "What is that?" the prisoner said it was not ours, an Irish woman, a friend of her's, had brought it to her, but she could not tell her name, nor where she lived. I found it was the piece which had the pin in it, and I am certain by the length and width of the sleeves that it had been cut from the piece which I had left.</p>

I was on duty and heard a talking down the court - not quarrelling; I went to see what was the matter, and saw the prosecutor there, and the prisoner had hold of his waistcoat which was wide open - he had a bundle in his hand - I told them to go on about their business - I did not know what was in the bundle - I took the prosecutor to the watch-house - he then told me of the girl having robbed him; I pursued her and brought her in - the prosecutor had been drinking but knew what he was about - she said she had but 9 d., but the officer found 2 s. up in a corner.</p>

I said to the prisoner,"Why the deuce do you push so?" He made no answer - he was pushing very hard - my basket was pushed down by my side - I still held it - they left me. I immediately missed my purse with its contents from the basket - it could not have got out, without being taken out. I ran after the prisoner directly, he turned the corner of Union-street. I laid hold of him, and said "You villian! you have robbed me of my purse." - He had got about six yards from me. He said, "You have mistaken me?" He took his hat off, and wished his eyes might roll out into his hat, if he had taken it. I said "It is of no use young man making such oaths, for I am sure you are one of those who robbed me." He said, "He had not got my purse." I said, if not, his companion had. I gave him in charge. One of his companions ran on before him.</p>

            . I am a labourer to the East India Company. I was in Church-lane, and saw the prisoner coming towards me in a great bustle. I had a bag under my arm - he nearly pushed me off the curb-stones. - I turned round, and saw him forcibly pressing this woman against the shop window. I am certain he is the person. On my looking that way, the prisoner and another came from the woman - but the prisoner was the only man I saw about her - they came walking along very fast, and presently the prosecutrix said to the other "Go it." Immediately after that, the prisoner come after them - the other ran away as fast as he could. She caught hold of the prisoner's coat, and said, "Stop him! you villain you have robbed me." He denied it. I said, "You are one of the party." I saw you hustling her against the shop window. He took off his hat, and wished his eyes might drop out into it, if he knew any thing of the other man; he was secured, he could not have got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He made no attempt to get away? A. No, I never took my eye off him till the prosecutrix took hold of him, and did not see him give any thing to any body; he was the only person I saw near her, his back was towards me - nothing was found on him; I was three or four yards from the woman - plenty of people were passing - he ran about six yards before she seized him.</p>

On the 16th of July, between eight and nine o'clock at night, the prisoner and several others were in my tap-room - several bricklayers and labourers were there - one of them made a complaint - the prisoner at that time had his head down on his hat, apparently asleep; I roused him, and told him a man had lost his handkerchief, and they had seen him take it; I insisted on having it - he said, he had not got it; one of the labourers said, he thought he had given it to another man - I insisted on his leaving - he got further on to the box - I went to turn him out by force, and he struck me. I struck him again - my wife and servants came and moved the table from the box, and I lifted him out of the box - he stood up in the middle of the room; I changed my hand, and caught him by the left hand collar with my right hand, to lead him to the door - he instantly threw himself down on his back, and began hitting me; I stood over him, holding his collar; I did not know that he had a knife, but he stabbed me three times in my arm - people called out, "He is killing you, he is stabbing you;" I then saw the blood running from my arm; I let go of him, and went to the doctor's - he was not sober, but knew what he was about.</p>

On the 12th of September, about seven o'clock at night, he went out, and said he was going for a candlestick; they were kept in an another house; he came home about twenty or ten minutes before ten o'clock. I opened the door to him - he came up stairs, and sat down - he then went down - called the dog down stairs, and went out with it; he stopped out about five minutes - I opened the door to him; I did not see the dog come in with him, for the light went out. I had not seen the dog go out, but I did not see it after he called it down, till half-past eight o'clock the next morning - it then came up the court - it was outside the house. I fastened the shutters before he came in; Beechey was in master's employ, and held me a light while I fastened them. I went up stairs to bed, and fell asleep while Samuel Crook was undressing himself, and cannot say when he came to bed - but when I awoke in the morning he was in bed. It was twenty minutes before seven o'clock when I went down stairs, he was then in bed - I was the first person down stairs. I found the warehouse door wide open - it had been locked the night before, and the key left in a room under where we slept, in a table-drawer near the window. I had put both the warehouse key and the key of the door facing it there - the back door was open - but not the street door. I ran up, and called out "Samuel - all the house is wide open;" he asked if it was true? I said "It was" - and he said he should have all the blame of it. He put on his stockings and trousers, and came down with me. I found the counter-doors open, and a piece of umbrella silk laid on it; the slides of the counter had been broken open - and the desk also. I told him I thought he had taken the dog out, and if he had not taken it out, it would not have been done. The dog used to sleep by the warehouse-door, or up stairs; he said he had not taken it out; that it went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Whether the dog went out with him or not you cannot tell? A. No; we generally go to bed about ten or eleven o'clock - we both went up to bed together, and he brought the light down - one of us always bring the light down. I was undressed and in bed before he came up again - he sat on the bed, and began to pull off his clothes - we both slept in the same bed. I did not awake till morning, and then got up directly. I found him in bed when I awoke, and had not felt him get out in the night. We work in the bed-room in the day time making silk; any person belonging to the house goes in and out of the room in the day time.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. Did you hear him call the dog down as he went out? A. Yes; he was not in the habit of calling it down. I generally took the light down, but he said he would take it down that night. I said I would take it; he said No - he would take it. I had it in my hand to take down - he took it out of my hand.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Were you going to take it down before he was undressed? A. Yes; he was making the bed, and when the bed is made, the light is taken down. I never knew the dog absent on any other night; I saw it come in next morning at the back door, which was open an hour after I got up. I locked the warehouse door, just at dusk; the dog was in doors then - the key was up stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You found the back door open; the dog might have gone out there in the night if it was open? A. Yes.</p>

            , we live at No. 22, White's-row, on the second floor. On the Friday morning before the robbery, a little after seven o'clock, I opened the street door, and saw the prisoners William and Samuel Crook - they came in and followed me up stairs; one of them knocked at Mason's door, and called Ned - he was let in, and when the door was unfastened I went up to my own apartment, and soon after heard a Christian name called, but what I do not know. I looked into the street out of the window, and saw Samuel Crook come from the step of the street door, and stand under the window. William Crook soon after came from the door, and joined him; and soon after Mason came up fastened his neck handkerchief round his neck, and all three went away together - I watched them altogether as far as I could see. On Monday night, the officers came to the house and took Mason, and part of the property. Barrs, the officer, told me to mind the door of Mason's room. I went down to the street door, then returned with a candle in my hand, and was going to close Mason's door, and saw William Crook sitting in the room. I said "Oh! there you are, are you." I then double locked the door on him, and told Barrs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the Crooks before? A. I had repeatedly seen them, but not to know their names. Mason is a <rs id="t18250915-344-deflabel1853" type="occupation">braca maker</rs>

               <p>HECTOR CABKETT. About eight o'clock on the Friday morning, previous to this robbery, I saw the prisoner, Samuel Crook, in fustian jacket, with a roll of black silk; he went up stairs, and came down in about two minutes without it.</p>

            . I am inspector of the watch, and live in Fashion-street, Spitalfields. On the Monday, the night of the robbery, about a quarter past twelve o'clock, I and Barrs were in White's-row; I observed two men coming down White's-row; they passed the door, talking, then returned, and went into the house - it is where Carkett lodges. I went into the house, knocked at the door, and was answered by the female prisoner; I said, there were two men come into that house; she said there was not. I said I was confident of it - that I had seen one of them come out again, and there must be one there then; I asked her for a light - she assisted me in searching the lower part of the house; I found nobody there. Barrs was stationed there - he called me, and said there was a man coming out of the first floor window. I ran to the door, and saw a man getting in at the window - I believe it to be the prisoner Mason - we ran up to the first floor room; the window of which room I had seen the person at, and Mason stood there with the female prisoner - I laid hold of Mason. Barrs found some silk on the bed, and the moment it was found the female prisoner ran down, and escaped. I followed her - she was taken, and brought back. Next morning I went to Mr. Waterlow's premises, and examined the three outer doors - none of them appeared to have any marks of outward violence, nor inside, not on the doors - two of the slides under the counter, and a writing-desk, all had marks of violence on them - there were only two slides with locks, and they had marks of violence upon them; the two locks secured the whole four slides. I questioned Mr. Waterlow, and Samuel Crook was produced to me - I thought by his appearance he was the man I had seen go out of the house, in White's-row, and who had gone in with the other - he had neither coat nor hat on - I wished him to put them on; he went up, and did so. My opinion was then stronger that he was the person I had seen; I do not swear positively to him. I went up stairs to his room, and found a piece of iron behind his bed - I applied it to the marks upon the desk and slides - they corresponded particularly on the slides. I also found a pair of dirty shoes in his room - I asked him who they belonged to; he said they were not his, and afterwards that some person had given them to him; I found the jacket produced in the room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What do you call that iron? A. I do not know what to call it - it is not a crow-bar; it is common for thieves to enter premises by false keys. I saw nobody let the men into the house in White's-row - the door was open - it was a quarter or twenty minutes past twelve o'clock at night. I was about twenty yards from them; I had never seen Samuel Crook before: there is a gas-light over the door. I am not positive of him; I am not certain whether the one who came out was the one who went in.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS to JOHN CHAPPELL. Q. Did you see him clean his shoes when he came in that night? A. No; I saw the shoes there in the morning, when the bed was turned up.</p>

            . I am an inspector of the watch, and was with Almond. I observed a man standing over the rail of the sewer, which was open - he went away. I was stationed at the door of this house afterwards - when Almond was going up stairs, I observed the prisoner Mason coming out of the first floor window - I had a good view of him by the gas light, and am certain he is the man - I called Almond down; Mason then went at the window again, and broke a square of glass; I ran up and collared him in the room; Almond came and laid hold of him - I turned my head aside, and under the counterpane of the bed, I found a bundle of silk - took it to the watch-house, the prosecutors have since seen it and claimed it - the female prisoner ran away, but was taken, both were taken to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150129"/>watch-house - I returned to the house with a watchman, found the room door double locked - Mrs. Carkett unlocked it, and I found William Crook inside - I searched under the bed, and found seven more pieces of silk in a sheet - Crook was about three yards from me - he must have been under the bed, when we were taking Mason; there was no other hiding place. I went to the premises, no violence had been used to the outside of the doors - the desk and slides had been forced open, the iron corresponded with the marks on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose you searched Mason's room, to see if any other man was concealed? A. After we took Crook, I did, but not at first; I had seen a man resembling Samuel Crook about the house by the sewer, but will not swear to him - I have had the care of the silk ever since, and have brought it here.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know Mr. Waterlow's house? A. Yes, it is in the parish of Christ-church, Middlesex, commonly called Spitalfields - Christ-church, Middlesex. is the correct name - I know of no other Christ-church, in Middlesex.</p>

On this Monday night I slept out of town, and I returned about half-past nine o'clock, next morning - I had left fifteen shillings in my writing desk - that was gone - I missed seven hundred and sixty-eight yards of silk altogether, worth 150 l., and found the whole of it at the watch-house; it belongs to me and my partner - in consequence of what was told me, I called Samuel Crook down, and gave him in charge - I saw his hat on the table in the room under where he sleeps, near the window - the keys are kept in that table drawer - he had no business with the keys - he takes his supper in that room, they sup about twelve o'clock - the whole of the silk is mine, every piece is worth more than 40 s. - there are fourteen pieces, seven in each parcel - I know some by my private mark, some by the border and figure - they are worth from 8 l. to 12 l. a piece.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is your father alive? A. Yes, he has no concern in the business - Mr. Sawyer lives some where at Islington - I pay rent and taxes; we have only been in business nine months - I shall have to make a charge for the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. His hat might be in that room every night? A. He supped there - the table is not the place for his hat - the servant brought the keys to me. I have no doubt but they were found in the table drawer - I never saw his hat there before; I returned on Tuesday morning; I had left town about four o'clock on Monday afternoon.</p>

               <p>MR. WATERLOW. This iron instrument is mine, it was used in the silk trade four years ago, but never at this house - the slides under the counter, where we kept the silk was broken open - there are bolts to the ware-house door, back and front, but no locks - they were all inside fastening - there is a lock to the street door, but not to the back door, that bolt is inside - the wash-house opens into the passage.</p>

On the 1st of August, about half-past one o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed - it was moon-light, or it would have been dark. I got up, and found a ladder which is kept at the farther end of the yard placed under Mrs. Short's window - it was at the other end of the yard the night before.</p>
               <p>MARIA SHORT. I am a widow, and lodge at Mrs. Green's, on the first floor. On the 1st of August, about twelve o'clock, I went to bed. I shut the window down, and put a gimblet into it, but whether it caught the outer sash or not I cannot say, but am certain it was quite shut down. I went to sleep, and was alarmed about half-past one - it was moon-light - I could see my black petticoat on the floor - I was laying on my right side, with my baby sucking at my left breast, and on opening my eyes I saw a man reaching inside the window. I saw him take some of my clothes out of my box - the window was open, and he was leaning within it - both his arms were in the room. I was so alarmed I could not call out - I endeavoured to kick my eldest boy, who laid at the foot of the bed, but could not awake him - he took the clothes out of my box, and threw them out of the window - after that I heard the window above stairs open - the man was then within my window - I then saw him go gradually down - I got out of bed, and gave an alarm - Mrs. Barns gave the first alarm. I went into the yard, and found the ladder under my window. I had seen him going down the ladder, and Mrs. Barns said, "There is a man in the yard." I noticed that he had a dark coat on, but cannot swear to his person. I first saw him in the yard, and afterwards saw him get over the wall into the field. I missed the articles stated in the indictment (enumerating them). I gave information of the robbery next morning, and went into the taproom of the Red Lion public-house, and saw a man sitting down with a yellow silk handkerchief round his neck. I came out, and said I was sure he was the man who had robbed me. I felt certain of it, by the appearance of his coat - it was a particularly long coat, and came down to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150130"/>the calves of his legs - I noticed it as he stood in the yard, before he went to the wall - I thought it exactly like the coat, and consider that the handkerchief was mine, and one which I had lost that night. I am certain the prisoner is the man I saw in the public-house. I went down to the office, and met Foster, the officer. He went with me to the Red Lion, but he was gone then. I found him by the turnpike-gate, and pointed him out to Foster, who went up to him. He was taken to the Black Dog public-house, and my handkerchief taken off his neck by Foster. The prisoner Gale came into the public-house, and he said to her, "I believe all is right." Foster told Lea to follow her home. I followed her, and went up to her room. Lea let down the bed, and I found some of my flannel - it was a petticoat, partly made, and some calico - a child's tippet, and my purse, was found in her pocket. I had seen no woman about the house. Gale solemnly declared she knew nothing of the robbery, and said her husband gave her the purse.</p>

            . I lodge in the room over Mrs. Short. On the 1st of August, about twelve o'clock at night, I opened my window, and heard the church clock strike twelve. After that, not finding myself very well, I struck a light, put it out again, and tried to go to sleep, but could not rest. I got up and opened my window again, and thought it was break of day, it was such a very moonlight night. The watchman called half-past one when I opened the window. I saw a man in the yard, and saw him go to climb over the wall - I gave an alarm of Thieves. He had on a dark coat, which seemed to hang low, and to be full behind, but it was not a great coat. He had a high crowned hat, which was narrower down at the brim.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 2d of August, in consequence of information, I went to look for Clark, and found him by Mile-end turnpike; I asked where he was on Monday night - he said at home - I asked what time he was at home; he said he could not say to an hour; I asked where he got the handkerchief which was round his neck - he said he bought it yesterday morning in Petticoat-lane for 1 s. 6 d. - I said he must go into the public-house, for I wished to search him; we went backward, into the parlour - I saw both his hands up to his neck, and when we got to the parlour door, he threw the handkerchief off his neck into the parlour, and said, "Go in there, and I will be with you directly - I want to go backward." I said "No, you must go in now;" he had the door half open - I called him: he said, "Let me go; I am taken very bad;" I took him into the parlour, and told Mrs. Short to look at the handkerchief; she exclaimed "That is my handkerchief, and what my husband wore when he died?" she nearly went into a fit; he said "Be quiet, my good woman, I dare say all things will be right;" I searched him and found a key, which, he said, was the key of his door; I asked where he lived; he said at No. 23, Easterfield-street, Stepney; I then went back into the yard with him, returned to the parlour, gave the key to Lea, and told him to go and search there. I took Clark to the office, and as I took him through the passages of the public-house, Gale stood there; he said something to her, and then said "It is all right;" I took him to the office; Lea brought Gale and some property there - the prosecutrix's house is in the parish of St. Dunstan's, Stepney.</p>

            . On the 2d of August, between ten and eleven o'clock, in the morning, I saw Clark; Gale came running into the passage of the public-house, and said, "Where is my husband?" Foster took Clark away, but before he went they whispered together; Gale crossed over the road; Short and I followed her to No. 23, Easter-field-street, Stepney; she went up, opened the door, and Short claimed some calico which laid on a chair there, and between the mattress and bed I found some flannel, which she claimed, and, between the bed and sacking, some more flannel; and a tippet in the room; and in Gale's pocket, I found a purse - she said Clark gave it to her.</p>

            . I am a carter. On the morning of the 28th of July, I saw the two prisoners and another woman at the corner of Beer-lane, Thames-street, near Barker's, they were looking at a shilling - I saw O'Connell go into Barker's with a milk pot in her hand, and afterwards saw her looking after one of the others - I assisted in securing the prisoners.</p>
               <p>MR. FIELD. These three shillings are counterfeit, and of the same die, merely washed.</p>
               <p>ROACH's Defence. I gave him 1 s., which he put into the till.</p>
               <p>O'CONNELL's Defence. I was taken ill - she gave me 1 s. to get some peppermint.</p>

On Saturday, the 20th of August, about a quarter past five o'clock, I was sitting in the counting-house - there was one young man left to attend the warehouse, while the rest were at tea; he came to the counting-house to speak to me, and while he was there, I saw a man enter the warehouse, and take eight cloth jackets, which I had just laid out with forty-four others - he made off with them - they cost us 1 l. each. I saw four of them again at the Mansion-house on the Monday following.</p>

            . I am an officer. I saw the prisoner on the 20th of August, about five or six o'clock in the evening, with another person, about three minutes walk from Mr. Early's shop. The prisoner had these four jackets tied up in a handkerchief - his companion got away. I asked the prisoner what he had got - he said some jackets, which were his property, and he had brought them from some vessel, which he named. I afterwards heard that Mr. Early had lost them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Does Mr. Watson live in that house in the winter? A. Yes, it is his dwelling-house - he was not there that night; he sleeps in the country in the summer time.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LESTER. I went to the shop about a quarter before eight o'clock on the morning of Saturday, the 23d of July; I took down the shutters, and carried them into a little court that leads into Ironmonger-lane. While I was so doing, the prisoner Barnett came and asked me the way to the back of the Bank. I told him I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150133"/>know what Bank he meant - I had then about three shutters to take down. When I took down the last shutter, he asked me where Threadneedle-street was - he then asked me for London-wall, then shewed me a note, and asked me again for several places, and then for Threadneedle-street again; he then went away, and turned to the right-hand, to the best of my recollection. I then went and got a broom to sweep the shop. When my brother came about nine o'clock, he missed the clock from off the counter. I had not noticed it that morning, but I had the night before - I then went up stairs and got my breakfast. At the time Barnett spoke to me, I saw a man at the corner of the shop, at the top of the passage, with a sailor's jacket on - it was neither of the prisoners; he was standing in the corner as I thought, to prevent my going up, while Barnett was engaging my attention. I have not seen that man since - I did not see any other man. Barnett was with me about three or four minutes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you ever seen Barnett before? A. No; I saw him again when he was taken up, which was some weeks afterwards. I have not been talking this business over with any one. I am not certain which way he went, but think he turned to the right. I did not stand watching the man - I was putting up the shutters, and happened to turn my eye round and saw him. I was at the Mansion House, and I there said positively that it was Barnett who occupied my attention in the court. I have no doubt of him now. That court leads into Ironmonger-lane.</p>

            . I am the wife of Mr. Irwin, a warehouseman - we live in King-street, opposite to Mr. Watson's shop. A little before eight o'clock, on the morning of the 23d of July, I was looking out at the window for my husband, and saw four men about Mr. Watson's - I am certain the three prisoners were there - I saw them for about five minutes - I saw Barnett talking to the boy in the passage - I saw Ward and the other at the window, and Copas standing a little back from the house - I saw Ward go to the court, while the boy was taking down the shutters - when he had took down the shutters, he went into the shop - Ward immediately went into the shop close at his heels, and brought out the clock - Ward and the other one then went away, turning towards Bucklersbury - the other man had his handkerchief in his hand - I do not know what then became of the other two - they might have been there for all I know. I am quite sure of the three prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I suppose you gave an alarm immediately? A. No, I did not for some time, till I saw my husband - it did not strike me at the moment - I told my husband as soon as he came home - Barnett was at the corner of the court, and I was at the opposite side of the street - it might occupy about two or three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the men their hats on? A. I think they had - I am positive they are the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. At your first examination did you speak to any of them positively? A. At my first examination I did not know where to find any of the parties, but when I knew where to look for them I cast my eye upon that man, and said "I am sure that is the man who was talking to the boy; and I think I have some recollection of the man in the middle."</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath did you pretend to swear to Ward the first time? A. As soon as I saw him I did. I told Mr. Watson about the robbery afterwards, I suspected that they had stolen the clock, and I told my husband of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you suspect any thing before your husband came home? A. Yes, I did, but I did not like to leave my house, having a good deal of property in it. The first time I saw Ward I spoke to his being one of them. I swore to Barnett when I knew where to look for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you mean to abide by the answer you gave me before; that you had so much property in your own house that you was afraid to give an alarm? A. I was so timid I was afraid to give an alarm.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign your examination each day? A. No, only on the second - I was not asked to sign it the first time. I said at the first examination that Barnett was the man who detained the boy, and afterwards I swore to Ward.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him before? A. No, not till that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you not looking at four different persons? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And do you mean to say that, before an individual or two were pointed out to you, that you said "these are the persons;" they were looking into the shop, were not their backs towards you? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. If you saw there were four person there, how is it you can not recollect the faces of more than you do? A. Because my attention was more directed to Barnett.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see the man when he was speaking to the boy - was his back to him and his face to you? A. No, he was looking about the street part of the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How soon afterwards did your husband come home? A. In about ten minutes; he looked for Mr. Watson immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of the men were in custody at the Mansion House the first time? A. Only two; on the second examination<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150134"/>the three prisoners were in custody - I then pointed out Ward.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You say you saw Ward come out with the clock? A. Yes, he was close behind the boy when he went into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. What space of time might elapse between Ward's going in and his coming out? A. Not an instant scarcely.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that you did not know or suspect that any robbery was being committed? A. Not, till my husband came home, and I told him. When I first went to the Mansion House I saw Barnett and Copas - they were standing before the Lord Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a great crowd? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pick them out from the crowd? A. Yes; the first examination was about a fortnight or three weeks before the second.</p>
               <p>Q. Who directed your attention to that part of the room where the prisoner's were? A. No one pointed them out to me, but when they were brought before the Lord Mayor, I knew the two prisoners, and said, that was the man who was talking to the man in the passage, and Copas was the other - when I knew where to look for them, I knew them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen them before they were brought before the Lord Mayor? A. No, not before they were charged before the Lord Mayor - on the second examination, I saw Ward, and knew him.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined on the first day? A. No, pointed out Barnett to Mr. Watson.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any oath administered to you on the first day? A. Yes, he asked me, if there was any body there that I knew; I said, No; but afterwards, when I saw them standing before the Lord Mayor, I told Mr. Watson that they were the men - the Lord Mayor said almost directly, they had better be remanded.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH LESTER re-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Where had you to go when you had taken down the shutters to get your broom? A. Through the shop along a passage to the pump, which leads down stairs into the kitchen - I was not aware that any body followed me into the shop.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When Barnett was speaking to you, had he his face towards you? A. Yes; I was in the court, leading down to Ironmonger-lane - I could not see this lady at the window in the court, nor she me - but the man was standing near the end of the court.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARD WATSON. My house is in the parish of St. Martin's, Ironmonger-lane - the clock was on the counter, within two yards of the door - I was present at the first examination; the prisoners were remanded, because one of the parties was not taken - Mrs. Irwin pointed out Barnett and Copas.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had Mrs. Irwin any question proposed to her at the first examination? A. She was told to look round and see if there was any body there she knew - Barnett was then about three yards from her - she said, there was not any one she could particularize - they were standing before the Lord Mayor at the time.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What lead her to discover the men afterwards? A. The second witness (Lester), being called, she recognized them, and said, "Oh! these are the men" - I several times attempted to get it heard before the Lord Mayor, but it was postponed to get the other persons.</p>

            . I am a carpenter, and live in Black Lion-square. I know the prisoners. On the 23d of July, about eight o'clock in the morning, I was going down Bucklersbury, and saw Barnett and a man (not here now) together; the absent man had a clock, and a handkerchief tied over the face, which was carried towards him - they were close by the Hope eating-house; knowing them I went into the Green Man, public-house, and inquired if Watts, the officer, was there, and they went on to Size-lane; I could not get an officer. I came out again, and saw the other person with the clock; they went on towards the Mansion House; I ran on to the Mansion House, to try to get an officer, but I could not; I lost sight of them at the end of Bucklersbury - it was then half-past eight o'clock. I then went to the Mansion House again, and gave information to Drinkwater, the officer. On the Saturday following I was in Leadenhall-street, and saw Barnett, Ward, and the man not here, all coming towards the Mansion House; I ran to the Rose and Crown public-house for an officer - I got Mr. Brown and another, and we came running after them, as far as the Mansion House, but they had got away again; after this I heard of their being in custody - I went to the Mansion House, and saw Hesketh, the officer, with Barnett and Copas outside the house. I knew them to be the same men, and told Hesketh so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Have you seen the clock since? A. No; it was brass inlaid.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. What part of it did the handkerchief cover? - A. Only over the top.</p>

            . I apprehended Barnett and Copas on Saturday, the 6th of August, in Bishopsgate-street. I had had information of Mr. Watson's robbery, and took them to Bishopsgate watch-house, and afterwards to the Mansion House. Kingsbury came and said he knew them.</p>
               <p>BARNETT'S Defence. I know nothing of the robbery.</p>
               <p>COPAS' Defence. I was at work at the time - I am a <rs id="t18250915-354-deflabel1923" type="occupation">bricklayer</rs>

               <p>WARD'S Defence. As I was going down Whitechapel-road Mr. Lea met me, and told me he wanted me for a crime that he knew I was innocent of. I went to Lambeth-street, and when I had been there about an hour and a half, Mr. Watson and that woman, who looked through the window came, and they neither of them said they knew me; and after the woman had been there half an hour she said she thought I was the person.</p>
               <p>JURY to KINGSBURY. Q. Did you know the persons of the prisoners before that morning? A. Yes, perfectly well. Barnett and the one not in custody had the clock, but Copas had nothing; they were all four there, but on different sides of the way.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he in your employ? A. Yes; he lived twice with me - the first time for about five years; the last time he came to me in great distress, being out of work, and I said I would give him 10 s. a week, and the moment he could suit himself better he could leave. He is not a good workman - he was to go on errends; the second time he worked as a clicker - I give my other clickers 24 s. or 25 s, a week.</p>

I took the prisoner into my employ in May last, in consequence of having a good opinion of him. I was to give him 50 l. a-year, and to find a lodging in my warehouse for himself and family. I left town on the 12th of August, and left fifty bundles of worsted in my warehouse; when I had been absent a little time I received a letter, and returned to town. I went to my warehouse, but the prisoner was not there. I saw him on the afternoon of the 20th, and asked him what worsted had been sent out in my absence. He said none. I missed a considerable quantity. I went home, and the key of the warehouse was sent me the following evening about seven o'clock. I went next morning, and found the prisoner, his wife and child were gone away. There were several boxes left belonging to him - they were opened, and some papers found in his desk were open, and this paper was found in it - reads "Messrs, Block and Son, Dr. to - ." as if it were the beginning of an invoice. I afterwards saw Mr. Block, who shewed me this paper in the prisoner's hand-writing. I caused a search to be made, and found him on the Thursday evening following, in the Edward-road; he ran away - I set up a hue and cry, and he was taken - here is a sample of worsted which was found in his box.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. From what part of the kingdom did the prisoner come? A. From Birmingham - about two years ago - he had been in good circumstances - his wife is related to mine; I had perfect confidence in him - my suspicions were excited by the letter I had received - when I returned the prisoner was there - I did not use any harsh expressions to him - when he went he left his desk open, and his boxes locked - he had no business to deal for any other person. I cannot swear the worsted - all I can say is, that this is like some I had in my possession, and which other persons must have likewise. The property is my own, and is regularly consigned to me by invoice.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Has your worsted any particular number? A. Yes; this is No. 12 slack worsted - the bulk of my worsted is on the ground floor, to which the prisoner had access - when I returned there were twenty-six bundles missing.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Block. The prisoner was the man who brought the worsted to my masters.</p>
               <p>JAMES CASTLE. I live at No. 7, Bull's-head-court. About nine o'clock in the morning of the 17th or 18th of August, I saw a light cart, painted green, draw up to the door of No. 1, and sixteen or eighteen brown paper parcels were tossed into it, two at a time. I have seen the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150137"/>bundles that remain at the prosecutor's warehouse, and they seem exactly like those.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARLOW re-examined. Q. Had the prisoner any authority to sell goods for you? A. Yes; if application was made to him, but he was not to make application. My price at that time was 2 s. 8 d. per lb. I had no other clerk nor porter.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the return of Mr. Barlow from Halifax, he accused me of stealing worsted; I distinctly denied it, and said "The quantity of worsted is the same as you left it," which it certainly was - many words arose out of it, and he said, "I am desired by my employers to discharge you instantly - however painful to my feelings I must instantly discharge you;" "I am sorry, Sir," said I "but I dare say I can find other employment." I was taken five days afterwards, in the Edgware-road, where my wife was about to open a little shop; I took the key over to him myself; it was not a clandestine departure. - A good deal has been said about my boxes; when I was taken the prosecutor said, "Do you know any thing of any cutlery" - I said, "My boxes are all there, search my papers, my pocket-books, and every thing for proofs (if you can find them) of my infidelity" - there was not a lock on any box. A good deal has been said about a bit of worsted being found in my desk - these samples were about the warehouse, and I was in the habit of shewing them - it might have been in my pocket; because five individuals had applied for samples, which I had shewn them - it might have been in some of my apartments, but it was not in my boxes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM BARTON re-examined. Q. How long was it before you left that you saw these fifty bundles of worsted? A. On the morning I left (the 12th of August) - on my return I discharged the prisoner, on my own authority - I never said that any persons had directed me to discharge him. On the Thursday after he left he sent a note to me, with a cart, and desired the goods that were left might be given up to him; and the carter told me, with a great deal of reluctance, that he was not to go to a house, but to meet the prisoner in the Edgware-road, opposite the New-road, Paddington; I went there, and met him. I did not know of any house being taken.</p>

I saw the prisoner there, but did not see him do any thing; there were four or five boys together, and I saw one of them take the handkerchief from Mr. Mullett's pocket, but I cannot swear that it was the prisoner; about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour afterwards, a gentleman came and gave a handkerchief into my hands; I did not know that it was the handkerchief taken from Mr. Mullett; I seized the prisoner, because I thought he was the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150138"/>one who took the handkerchief; I saw him near him; I seized the prisoner at the time it was drawn; I signed this deposition at the Mansion House (looking at it); I did swear that the prisoner was the person, but I was sick, and had not been in such a situation before; I did not know what I was about; but, my Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I did wrong, and I am very sorry; I have seen the person since who did take it - it was not the prisoner; the reason I swore at the Mansion House that it was him, was I thought it was him, but now I cannot say, (from there being a crowd at the time of the robbery,) that it was him; I have since seen the person who I can swear committed the robbery, and I cannot now take upon me to swear against the prisoner.</p>

            . I went to Mr. Govan's on the 28th of July; I searched the prisoner, and found five sovereigns in the button-hole of his jacket - he began to cry and said, it was part of Mr. Dallimore's bill - there was no guinea found on him.</p>
               <p>ROBERT GOVAN re-examined. Q. Had you asked the prisoner on the 27th of July, if he had received Mr. Dallimore's bill? A. Yes, and he said No, he paid me 6 s. 8 d. that day, which was all - I went on the 28th to inquire and found it had been paid.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police Surveyor. I was on duty about two o'clock in the morning of the 28th of August, and heard a call for the police from the Sarah and Mary. I went on board, and found the prisoner in custody of the crew. I took him, but only found a small piece of money on him - he had no hat on; I asked him where it was, one of the ship's company took up a hat from the deck, and said "Here is a hat;" the prisoner at first said it was his; but I looked into it, and found this watch - then he said it was not his. I put it on his head, and said "It is your's no doubt." I took him in the police-boat, and asked where he got the hat; he said he bought it on shore for 1 s. 6 d. I then said "Where did you get the watch?" he said I should hear about that next morning. I then called to the people on board the vessels in that tier, and said, if any person had lost a watch, they might apply to the office - the Times was one of the vessels. The prisoner then said, he had taken it from one of the vessels - he had only come out of prison on the Thursday, and he must go there again. I asked him how he found it in the dark; he said he heard the b - y thing tick, and took it through distress.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was three months in the House of Correction. I applied to the Prussian Consul, and he said "You have been in confinement, and shall go there again;" So I was obliged to go on board the ship, and take this watch to support me.</p>

            . I am an apprentice to Mr. Reeve, the pawnbroker. On the 22d of August, between seven and eight o'clock in the morning, the prisoner came to our shop, and offered these two hats, which I have had in my care ever since. I saw the name of Oakey and Co. inside and asked how he got them; he said his father worked for Mr. Oakey, and desired him to pawn them - I kept the hats and sent him to fetch his father - but no person came.</p>

I made a bit of a stop to ease myself, and three women went before me - they were Gainsford, Porter, and one who is not taken. I went on, and the one who is not here said "Come old fellow, are you not going to have sixpennyworth to night." I said "It is a pity but you had sixpennyworth at the tread-mill." I turned my head, and saw Thompson and Brooks coming after me; they immediately struck me, knocked my hat over my eyes, and knocked me down, and began to ill-use me in a most cruel manner; one of them said "Cut the b - 's ear off, and frisk him;" they took my watch from my pocket, and 2 s. 1 d. from my right-hand waistcoat pocket. I knocked down Porter, and the one who is not here, and got the watch from them; they ran away into Little Moorfields - I followed, and said, I should detain them till I got assistance to take them. The whole five then immediately beset me, and ill-used me again. After I had been knocked about in a most horrid manner, and a great many persons collected, an officer came named Herbert. I asked him to take them into custody; he said he had nothing to do with it, I must go about my business, or he would take me - they all burst out laughing. In about half an hour, I got the assistance of some friends, and found an officer named Payne; he took the girl who is not here, searched her, and let her go. I then went to Cripplegate watch-house, and the constable sent an officer with me. I found Gainsford and Thompson in Little Moorfields; we took them to the watch-house, went out again, and found Porter, who ran away, and got in between the two horses of a hackney coach; we took her, and the next evening, I took Brooks in Little Moorfields. I asked her where she was going - she said, "To take a walk." I said, if she would go with me to the corner of Moor-lane, I would talk about that. I then gave charge of her.</p>

The prosecutor came and stated he had been robbed of his watch, and he had spoken to some officer, who would not assist him. I went with him to Little Moorfields, and we saw Gainsford. I told her I had a charge of felony against her; I told her to walk before me. I went down Little Moorfields, and there I took Thompson; I took them to the watch-house. When we were walking to Guildhall from the Compter, Gainsford and Brooks said they knew something about it. They said the prosecutor had asked a woman named Place to go down the alley for sixpence, which he gave her, but before she would go down she would spend it in gin, that as soon as she had drank the gin she would not comply with his wishes, and he struck her a violent blow, which caused her to cry Murder! and the others went up and assisted her; they admitted having struck him, but as to robbing him they denied it.</p>

            . I live at Southampton, and have been a cabinet-maker.

            . I live at No. 35, New Union-street, Moorfields, in the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, in the City. I knew the prisoner by the name of J. Cooper; he lodged with us in May last - he paid 5 s. down; I asked him for a reference, but he said if he paid the money down it would be sufficient, as he came from the country. A great many letters came to him in the name of "John Cooper, Esq.," and he opened them. I have frequently seen him write; these letters are his writing and this note, except the signature, "Robert Coles" - he was occupying our front room, on the first floor, when he was apprehended, and had been there about four months.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who do you live with? A. My grandmother. He occupied our room as a counting-house - he did not sleep there; he had a clerk there; I cannot swear to any particular letter which I saw him open; he has frequently shown me the difference of the clerk's hand-writing and his. I do not know of any letter he received so as to specify them; these two letters are written by the prisoner - he differs in his hand-writing; some of his papers were taken at our house - whether these were or not I cannot tell. I often took in letters of the postman for him; they were taken to his room; and he has opened them before me.</p>

            . I am watch-house-keeper, and know the prisoner - I saw him write this letter while he was in custody at the watch-house; he asked me to get it delivered according to the address "Mr. Williams, No. 8, Lloyd's-row, Sadler's Wells." I sent for Bee an officer, and gave it to him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you always take this manly course with letters? A. No; it is very rare that we have letters, but I generally see them. I made no mark on this letter, but it appears to be the same.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COLES re-examined. Q. Was this letter produced to you when the prisoner was arrested? A. The watch-house keeper read it at Bunhill-row - I went to the place described; the landlady shewed us which was Mr. Williams's room. I found my own letters and bills there; the letters had been addressed to "No. 35, New Union-street."</p>

               <p>RNBERT COLES re-examined. Q. Did you, in consequence of this letter of the 11th of May, send any bill? A. Yes; a bill for 350 l., which I have not been able to find. I sent it in consequence of my belief that what was stated in this letter was correct. I received another letter, stating the form of that note was not correct, and I sent a second note on the 29th of May, for 350 l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you ever get it into your possession again till the prisoner was taken up? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was not that letter sent back to you by the post? A. No; it never came to my hands.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How many letters of your's did you find? A. Two. I sent three or four. I sent the last letter to the same direction as the other. I sent it by post, and paid the postage. It was never transmitted to me again; in consequence of the first letter, I sent the first note, and in consequence of another letter, I sent a second note on the 29th of May; I never received one shilling for either of them, nor had a word of explanation until the prisoner was taken up. I had him apprehended, and saw at Lloyd's-row the list of bills, and my letters,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182509150142"/>which had been addressed to New Union-street, and a vast number of papers beside. I sent my last bill on the 29th of May - came to town the 14th of June - and took the prisoner on the 15th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. I have not worked at any trade for some years. I have some houses, and live upon my property. I made a tea-chest last year. I did keep a shop, but am in no way of business now. I employ myself in working sometimes. I have nothing to do with farming, but like many others, I wanted accommodation for a short time. I have eight or nine houses, some of them are freehold - they let for about 150 l. a year. I did apply for money for this note - but if I had applied to my friends I might have borrowed it. I was in London the latter end of April, but had not negotiated a loan then. I never applied to a person named Coster to raise money - nor ever had any thing to do with the raising of money till I received the letter from the prisoner - nor ever saw him until he was in custody. I received an annonymous letter, in consequence of which I came to town, and called on Mr. Whitty, in the Temple, and on Messrs. Spinks and Brundett. I went to Abchurch-lane, and called at Mr. Cardale's office, by Mr. Creed's direction. I never saw Mr. Creed until I came to town. I had seen a prospectus about a society for the protection of trade. I went to Mr. Creed, on Tuesday the 14th of June. I had received the letter on Tuesday the 12th. I took the prisoner in Finsbury-square. I sent my first note in a letter to him. I have never had any money demanded from me, by virtue of that note. I transmitted a letter containing my second, on the 20th of May, and came up to town on the 13th of June. I found the note at the prisoner's lodgings.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You received your anonymous letter and came to town, and saw Mr. Creed at Mr. Cardale's office, and went and discovered these things? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you go to Mr. Spinks, in consequence of the letter you received from London? A. Yes; I applied to a solicitor in Southampton, and he gave me a letter to Brundett and Spinks.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you discontinued your acquaintance with him? A. Yes, since the month of February last; from that time I have known nothing more of him than his being here; when I speak of him as in connexion with Coster, I mean he was employed by Coster; since then he may have gone into business, which I have not known; he arrested me in the month of May, and he had been bail for me on some occasions before.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. You had not parted upon bad terms? A. No, I had no quarrel with him.</p>

               <p>I have been informed, you require an advance of 500 l.; if this is correct, as I have an unlimited discount at a Scotch Bank, I will cash your acceptances, or promissory notes for the above, or any other sum; at three or six months, charging five per cent, interest, and 2 s. 6 d. for commission; and I will also undertake to renew the same as they become due, upon receiving ten days' notice, that I may have time by receiving others to provide for the first - you may rely upon honour and secrecy.</p>

               <p>SIR;</p>
               <p>Unless I am in possession of your promissory notes, at least ten days, I cannot hand you the proceeds, as I before stated. I discount with a country bank; you will not be running the slightest risk in sending it to me direct, as I must indorse it myself, before I cash it - I will enclose you a Bank of England post bill for the amount, after deducting interest and commission.</p>
               <p>JOHN COOPER.</p>

               <p>May 28, 1825.</p>
               <p>SIR;</p>
               <p>I received your letter, but the bill is of no use, in consequence of a mistake in the drawing of it; I now send you a copy, and be careful to make it correct; you must make it payable in London, where your banker's, at Southampton, make their country notes payable, and when it is due, by paying the money into the Southampton bank, they will send it to the London bankers to pay it.</p>

            . I have known the prisoner by the name of Frederick Wilson. He lodged with me at No. 25, John's-row, St. Luke's. He first rented a front room furnished, at five shillings and sixpence per week, and afterwards took the floor at eight shillings. He always slept there, and kept very good hours. I saw a gentleman twice who came to visit him, and gave his name Coster. I did not think he was in circumstances of affluence - when he first came, I took him to be a lawyer's clerk - he had no servant - he had a wife and two children - his circumstances seemed to improve while he was there - I have lent him a few shillings at times.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long was he with you? A. He came a month before Christmas, and left on the 18th of April.</p>
               <p>ROBERT COLES re-examined. Q. Will you look at this printed letter, and tell me whether you had writter a letter to which this was reply? A. Yes I had, which I addressed to "Stewart and Co.;" I think I did address a letter to Coster, in Staining-lane. I did not receive any letter from Coster, signed "Coster;" it was some considerable time afterwards before I received a letter from the prisoner - I think it was in April or March that I wrote to Stewart.</p>
