               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of either of the Prisoners that are here?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I saw Clay the Day that he was taken, and Mathews I saw the 23d of November.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against them?</p>
               <p>Hillier. My House was broke open the 6th of June, at Night. I went to Bed about Ten o'Clock, and about Two the Watchman called me up, and I found the House was robbed.</p>
               <p>Q. What Part of the House was broke open?</p>
               <p>Hillier. They opened the Shutter, and cut out a Square of Glass; then they put in their Hands, and opened the Casement. It was pulled to when I came down, but not fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to Bed, did you see the Window fast?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Yes, my Lord, I went last to Bed, as I always do.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your Family?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I have a Wife and three Children, the eldest about Thirteen</p>
               <p>Q. What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I lost a Cotton Gown, three Shirts, two Shifts, one Table-Cloth, two Aprons.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were all these Things?</p>
               <p>Hillier. In the Kitchen, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What besides?</p>
               <p>Hillier. A Pair of Worsted Stockings, two Handkerchiefs, four Brass Candlesticks, two Pewter Dishes, six Plates, one Pepper-Box, a Skimmer, and a Gun. I have the Gun in Court. I was told the Gun was in Chancery Lane; afterwards I heard it was at Mr Body's, at the Mulberry-Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. How came the Gun at Bridewell?</p>
               <p>Hillier. I cannot tell</p>
               <p>Q. Who delivered it to you?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Mr Body.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does he live?</p>
               <p>Hillier. At the Mulberry Garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you at first see the Gun?</p>
               <p>Hillier. In Bridewell</p>
               <p>Q. What became of it afterwards?</p>
               <p>Hillier. Body had it, and has brought it into Court.</p>
               <p>Q. What particular Marks has it?</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050004"/>Hillier there is a Name upon the Lock, but I never observed it; but as it is grafted, I know it is my own.</p>

               <p>Hillier. I do not know of any Thing else, but what Collet told me, my Lord. When I saw Mathews on Sunday was Sev'night, he offered to make me Satisfaction for my Loss, if I would not appear against him.</p>

            . What do you say of this Matter?</p>
               <p>Collet. My Lord, Clay and Mathews were with me to break the House open the 6th of June last, between Twelve and Two in the Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose House open?</p>
               <p>Collet. Mr Hillier's.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it broke open?</p>
               <p>Collet. Clay turned the Pn round, and the Key dropped out; then Clay opened the Shutter, and cut the Lead away to take a Pain of Glass out; then he opened the Casement, and then opened the Door, and let us all in, Mathews and I, and Mecum that was cast the last Sessions. Then we took a Parcel of Linnen, Shirts and Shifts, Pewter and Brass, and a Gun.</p>
               <p>Court. One Man could not carry all these Things.</p>
               <p>Collet. There were four of us, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you carry the Things?</p>
               <p>Collet. They were carried into the Minories, to the Place where I lived, and the next Day Mathews carried them to sell, all to the Gun, and went away with the Money, and did not return for three or four Days. I cannot say what he sold them for.</p>
               <p>Court. So it was not shared?</p>
               <p>Collet. He kept it all to himself.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mathews do in the House?</p>
               <p>Collet. Mathews helped to take the Things away.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the Gun?</p>
               <p>Collet. The

            . Mr. Collet's supposed Wife desired me to go to see the Prisoner, and I heard Collet say, he wished the Prisoner at the Bar (meaning Mathews) at Hell before he had been took, for he believed he was about to hang an innocent Man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it that he told you this?</p>
               <p>Sealey. As I was sitting in New Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Sealey. I live in Half-moon Court.</p>
               <p>Collet. My Lord, she went to lay with Mathews several Times in the Prison.</p>
               <p>Q. to - Cordozo. How long have you known the Prisoner Mathews?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050005"/>Cordozo. When I knew him first, it was about the 30th of June, the Prisoner lodged with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Cordozo. In Hounsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your House furnished with?</p>
               <p>Cordozo. With Furniture, as other Houses are.</p>
               <p>Q. How ca me you to let him Lodgings?</p>
               <p>Cordozo. A Neighbour desired me.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business did he follow then?</p>
               <p>Cordozo. I never saw him in any Business, but in a Sea-faring Dress. He use to make trading Voyages as far as I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you ever desired to set the Prisoner? Was you ever desired or directed to watch that Man upon any Occasion?</p>
               <p>Cordozo. For the setting Part, I do not know any Thing of it; indeed I was to send a Man to him; but to say I knew of his returning from Transportation, I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether any Person directed or advised you to assist them in taking Mathews? I will make you answer me yea or no.</p>
               <p>Cordozo. I was sent in that Shape, it is true. I was to send a Man to him at an Inn.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he to be taken for?</p>
               <p>Cordozo. Nothing but for returning from Transportation. [This Witness had before very much prevaricated in his Evidence, and was sharply reproved by the Court.]</p>

               <p>Starky. This Boy (the Prisoner) came into my Shop about Candle-light, and another Boy came presently after him; they asked for out of the Way Handkerchiefs; I am often attacked by them. I immediately suspected that they were Thieves. They asked for blue Birds-Eyes Handkerchiefs, which, perhaps, are not to be found in one Shop in fifty. They commonly ask for something that would puzzle our. They staid a little while, then went to the Door; and I stepped to the Door, upon the Rails I had some Handkerchiefs, and I immediately missed a Piece. One of the Boys being gone, I laid hold of the Prisoner, but he had not the Handkerchiefs. The Prisoner said, he knew nothing of it himself, but the Boy that was with him was whistling in the Street, and he would go after him; but I said I would secure him.</p>

The Boy cried, I asked him if he had any Money to buy Silk Handkerchiefs; he said he had not, but the other had, which he had received for his Week's Work: So he says to me, they are whistling in the Street, if you will go with me, I will take them both.

               <p>Q. Do you know the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Neal. My Lord, I never saw him before he was taken. I missed the Watch the 20th of September, pretty early in the Morning: I had lost the outside Case two Days before. It was a Watch that I had to repair; after I had repaired the Watch, in the Intrim, on Saturday Morning, the Watch that belonged to the same Case, I missed; looking at the Window, I saw a Corner of the Glass cut out, where there was about Room to take the Watch out, with which I concluded the Watch was gone by the same Hand that stole the Case. I thought it was not prudent to advertise it directly. I have often observed, when Watches are lost and advertised, without no Questions asked, they are seldom heard of, and I thought it would look like hiding Theft; for that Reason I determined to wait a-while. I waited ten or twelve Days, when one Mr King, Constable in Bartholomew-lane, called upon me, to know if I had not lost a Watch. He said, if you can go over the Way with me, and drink a Glass, I can tell you something about it. He then told me he had taken up a little Boy, one Mr Lane, and he would make no Scruple to tell the whole Affair. When I came, the little Boy told me he was sorry he had said so much, but he would not say any more. He told me what he had said to Mr King, I might make what Use I would of it, he had said one

Then I applied to Mr Gardner (from whom they had taken the Gold Watch) first for his right Name, and whether he could give me any Information about it. In a few Days afterwards, Mr Gardner saw the Prisoner go by, and took him: and I do not remember that he pretended, from first to last, to deny it. The next Day we went to the Lord-Mayor, and his Lordship remembered him as soon as he saw him, that it was the same Boy as was before him for Mr Gardner's Gold Watch, and that was tried the Sessions before last. The Boy turns to me and says, he need not be surprized, I have been tried since that at Kingston Assizes. Upon this my Lord granted a Warrant for

            . The Prisoner at the Bar made a great Noise at my Door, the 14th Day of November at Night. I live the very next Door to this Gentleman, the Witness. My Boy heard some-body make a Noise at the Door; he went down and opened the Door, and the Prisoner asked if Mr Rigby was at Home, the Boy answered yes; he said, call him down then, then my Boy called me down, as I was coming down Stairs, the Prisoner said, Is not your Name Mr Rigby, says he, I am come to be taken Measure of by you for a Suit of Cloaths; I said, where do you lodge? he said, I lodge at the next Door, meaning the Prosecutor's House; I said, have you got the Cloth to make the Cloaths? he said no, but he should have it by nine o'Clock in the Morning; I said it would be Time enough to measure him then, but he would not let me rest till I had done it; he said he would send the Cloth to that Gentleman's at the Tavern, at nine o'Clock in the Morning, but he would not let me rest till I had measured him, and then he would not let me rest unless I would take a Tankard of Beer with him at the next Door, so I went into the Gentleman's House, and would have sat down in the Kitchen, but he would not sit there, but forced himself into the Bar; so the Gentlemen were talking about foreign Coin, &amp;c. and he talked with them while we were drinking the Tankard of Beer. I thought it long, it was my Bed-time, and I would go home. I left him in the Bar with the four Gentlemen; about half an Hour after I was gone to Bed, either this Gentleman came himself, or sent some of his Servants to my Door, and said I had brought a Man there that stole his Tankard. True, I did go in with the Man, but he said he lodged there. I never saw him before he knocked at the Door. I imagined that my Neighbour had sent me a Customer.</p>

            . I am a Peruke-maker, my Lord, the Prisoner came into my Shop, my Servant called me up (I was below Stairs); the Prisoner said he wanted to bespeak a Wig of me. I looked at the Man, and I did not think he was a Person that wanted a Wig. He said he belonged to a Privateer, that he was just come home, and he was going to receive 70 l. behind the Exchange; but seeing the Man so shabby, and I thought a little in Liquor, I did not regard what he said, but wanted to get rid of him, and looked to see that he should not take any Thing from me. At last he says, I will speak with you; he said, it is a sad Thing for a Man to be in Distress; I said it was impossible that he should be in Distress, that was going to receive so much Money so soon. He desired me to lend him a Couple of Shillings; he pressed me very much, but I let him have nothing. I asked him his Name, and he gave me his Name in Writing, that it was Captain

               <p>Interpreter. He says he saw them before they robbed him, but he has got his Things again.</p>
               <p>Q. In what Manner did they rob him?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. She took the Watch out of his Pocket, the tallest of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did one of them rob him of both Watch and Hanger?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The tallest robbed him first of the Watch, and the other of the Hanger.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him, if he knew when they did it, and whether he saw them do it?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. Yes, my Lord, he did see it when she first took it out of his Pocket. Then she played<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050009"/> with it, then went down Stairs; then the other came up Stairs, and took the Hanger from him.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he in Company with them?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. They pick'd him up, and carried him to their Lodgings, then shut the Door upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them pick'd him up?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The tallest pick'd him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him how he came by his Things again?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He went down Stairs, then they denied i t; then they throwed him down upon the Floor; then he insisted upon having his Things again; then there came a Matter of four of them, and opened the Door; then they offered him the Hanger, but he would not take the Hanger without the Watch.</p>
               <p>Court. I hope he will keep better Company.</p>
               <p>To the Prisoner. Would you have him asked any Questions?</p>

Buckley said she would fetch the Man that owned it, when I would not lend her any Thing upon it without; she at first brought in a tall Irishman, to whom she said it belonged.

               <p>Q. Will you ask this Witness any Questions? he swears that both of you came together to pawn this Watch.

             being a Foreigner, answered by an Interpreter.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether he was robbed, and when?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The 24th of November, at One o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was he when he was robbed?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. By <placeName id="t17461205-9-crimeloc37">the Bagnio in Long-acre, near St Martin's-lane</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17461205-9-crimeloc37" type="placeName"

               <p>Court. Ask him to give an Account of the Manner how he was robbed?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The Man that robbed him, seized him behind, threw him down flat upon his Back, and kneeled upon him; then the Man robbed him, laid hold of his Sword, he forced the Sword out of his Hand, and broke his little Finger in the first Joint.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he take any Thing else from him?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He took his Hat and Wig, and robbed him of 4 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him if there was any more than one?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He says only one. When the Man forced the Sword out of his Hand, he took hold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050010"/> of the Man by the Coat, and felt a Leather Apron.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it dark or not?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. It was a little Moon-light.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether he distinguished the Face of the Person that robbed him?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. Yes, my Lord, the Person that robbed him had one of his Cheeks swelled that Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he observe any Thing else by which he knew the Person?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He had a light coloured Great-coat on.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him the Reason why he says the Prisoner at the Bar is the Man?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He says he is he.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he do upon this, did he tell it to any body? How came he to find out the Person?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He pursued him till he was taken that same Night.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether he kept Sight of the Thief?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. Yes, he kept Sight of him till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he take him?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He cannot positively say as to the Place, but he thinks about thirty or forty Steps.</p>
               <p>Q. Which Way did the Man run?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He run from him down St Martin's-lane. He says he does not know the Name of the Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Which Side of St Martin's was it? Ask him, whether the Man that robbed went towards Newport-street, or the other Way? Did the Prisoner meet him, or overtake him?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He came behind him he says, the Prisoner ran the same Way that went to his House.</p>
               <p>Court. Then when he was robbed, and the Man was running away, he followed him?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He cried out continually during the Time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body assist him?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. Mr Webb.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Council for the Prisoner. Please to ask him how he could see the Prisoner, when he was assaulted behind? How could he discern his Countenance, when he was down on the Ground?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He observed his Countenance while he was upon him, and when he had hold of his Sword, and he (the Prisoner) offered to stab him with his Sword, and he took hold of the Prisoner's Leather Apron, and he cried for Mercy, Mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether he was fuddled, or sober?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He had drank, but he was in a Condition of observing every Thing.</p>
               <p>Council. I would ask him, whether he did not draw his Sword upon the Man first?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He had no Time to do it before the Person seized him.</p>
               <p>Council. The Question I would put is, Whether the Prosecutor had not Conversation with a French Woman before the Justice, and said, he would never have prosecuted this Man, unless he had been hurt in his Finger, or whether he declared that he was robbed?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. The young Woman which speaks French, spake to him at the Justice's, and he told that this Man was drunk, the Man that attacked him, and knew not what he was about; that it was pity, and it would hurt the Man considerably; and the Justice asked him whether he would prosecute; to which he answered, as the Man had wounded him, and so hurt him, he positively declared before the Justice, he was obliged in Honour and Conscience to take the Law.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr Webb. Did you see this Mitchel that Night?</p>
               <p>Webb. As I was passing Long-Acre, going to Lincoln's-Inn, I did not take it to be past 12 o'Clock. I was going the other Side of the Bagnio; I had past about sixty Yards towards Lincoln's-Inn; that I heard several Voices of disorderly people (that put me upon my Guard) then it ceased all at once; presently after I heard a cry of Watch, Watch, upon which I went back, in order to give what Assistance I could to the Person distressed. I had not gone above twenty or thirty Yards, but I met the Prisoner at the Bar come running towards me, (there was a little Moon) as soon as he perceived me, he endeavoured to cross the Way to avoid me; upon which I run up to him, and seized him, and held him; and in a little Time two of the Watch came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other Person near him?</p>
               <p>Webb. No, my Lord, the Watch came up in about ten or twelve Seconds; and Mr Mitchel, who had told me that he was robbed. He had on neither Hat, Wig, nor Sword, and seemed to have been down in the Dirt. The Moment he came up, we shewed him the Man, and as soon as I could make him understand that he saw the Man, he said that Man had robbed him; and I asked him whether he would charge the Watch with him, and he said he would.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all you know; had the Prisoner any Sword or Goods with him?</p>
               <p>Webb. When he was stopped, Sir, and the Watchman came up, I observed a Hat upon the Prisoner's Head, that seemed to me to be a very good one; I ordered the Watchman to take it off, and found a Ticket at the Side of it; and I desired the Prisoner to give an Account of the Ticket; while he was doing this, one of the Watchmen picked up a Hat behind<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050011"/> the Prisoner, which proved to be Mr Mitchel's Hat.</p>
               <p>Court. Very near to him?</p>
               <p>Webb. Close behind him; and as I was going back to the Watch-house, we had not turned above ten or fifteen Yards behind the Place where I stopped him; that I pick'd up the Sword.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pick'd up the Hat?</p>
               <p>Webb. The Watchman.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask Mr Mitchel if that is the Hat he lost that Night?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Webb, Did you take so much Notice of the Person as to know whether he had Leather Apron?</p>
               <p>Webb. Yes, Sir, and a Great-coat of a light Colour, as Mr Mitchel has described.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you see, Sir, any Hat dropped?</p>
               <p>Webb. No, Sir.</p>

Mr Mitchel said he was robbed of his Hat, Wig, and Sword; the Gentleman's Hat was picked up at his (the Prisoner's) feet behind him; and about seven Doors Length there lay the Sword, without any Scabbard; and as I was going along, I picked up the Wig two or three Doors from the Bagnio.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Hannon. We felt about the outside of his Coat, but found no Weapon, nor any thing about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the Prisoner the Person Mr Webb seized when you came up?</p>
               <p>Hannon. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the Prosecutor say how much Money he was robbed of.</p>
               <p>Hannon. About 4 s. 6 d.</p>

            . Give an Account of what you know of this Matter.</p>
               <p>Jones. I was at my proper Stand in the Acre. I heard two Men coming along; I thought they had been both fuddled; and one of them fell down as I took it be, and there was a Bustle some time; then they started up, and the Gentleman that came after me, called out Watch! and I saw a Man run the other Side of the Way. I cried out stop him, and pursued after him, and the Gentleman stopped him.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. What have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am a Cabinet-maker by Trade, I live next Door to the Crown Ale house, the Left hand Side as you go up Drury-lane. I went to see a Friend home that had come to see me and my Mother, and I drank at the Nag's-head in Hedge-lane. I being much fuddled, I would not go home till I had drank with her there. As I sat, I had three Pints of Beer. I met with another Neighbour, and would make her drink. I went in again, and had a Pot of Beer, and half a Pint of Gin; so I desired the Man of the House, as he had a Rabbet in the Cellar, I desired to have it; so I was so fuddled, that in catching the Rabbet, I fell upon my Face. My Mother sent the Maid for me to fetch me home, but I would not go, but went a Ramble, and got as far as St James's House. I went into a publick House to make Enquiry after a young Man of my Acquaintance; the Man told me, he was upon Guard that Day. I went and asked where he was, so we went into a Cellar by St James's Gate, where I staid some time, and my Friend's Wife and I came home together; so coming up Long-acre, this Gentleman he comes after us; this Gentleman Mitchel shoved us both against the Wall: So I says to him, is not the Street wide enough? I d - d him, and said, is not the Street wide enough? So I laid hold of him, he drew his Sword, and I shoved him into the Dirt, and threw his Sword into the Street, and went about my Business, and the Woman she was frightened, and was the first Person that screamed out Watch.</p>

               <p>Fullam. I know nothing of the Robbery; but Mr Welch told me she had a Gown out of the House.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you any Discourse with the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Fullam. I think it was in May last. I happened to meet the Prisoner coming under Aldersgate; Welch had complained to me that my friend had robbed him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Discourse with the Prisoner when you met her?</p>
               <p>Fullam. Yes, my Lord, I met her under Aldersgate, and she stopped me, and desired I would make it up with Welch, and she would give me the Price of a Suit of Cloaths.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say to her first?</p>
               <p>

               <p>Q. Have you any thing to say against her, with respect to the Fact for which she is indicted?</p>
               <p>Foy. I being a Servant with this Woman, Mrs Welch, I have been on and off with her five or six Times.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you live with her in April last?</p>
               <p>Foy. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you come to her?</p>
               <p>Foy. In May.</p>
               <p>Court. Why then you could not be with her in April.</p>
               <p>Foy. In March, I should say, I came to her.</p>
               <p>[Here this Witness was very much in and out, with respect to the Time: at first she said she came to her Mistress in May, then finding that overshot the Time of this Fact, then said it was in March; at first she said the latter End of March, then eight or nine Days in March.]</p>
               <p>Q. to Foy. What happened in April?</p>
               <p>Foy. It was on a Saturday, Mistress and Master was out in the Market; this Woman she comes up Stairs to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she do then?</p>
               <p>Foy. She came up, and sat down by the Fire; she asked me to drink part of a Dram, I told her I would not; she then asked me to drink part of a Pot of Beer.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time did she come to you?</p>
               <p>Foy. She came up between eight and nine at Night, and asked me to take a Dram, or a drink of Beer, and gave me Three-pence out of her Pocket, then I went for the Beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you bring it back?</p>
               <p>Foy. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you drink together?</p>
               <p>Foy. No, Sir, as I came up Stairs, there was a long Room, where they coined Half-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What, did your Mistress coin there?</p>
               <p>Foy. No, Sir, they coined Half-pence there formerly. As I went down Stairs, there stood two Women at the Door; I had no suspicion of them. I have seen the Prisoner come sometimes to my Master, there was two Women at the Door; and when I came up, the Door of the long Room was open, the Prisoner got the Bundle in her Lap; the Room had a Padlock upon it.</p>
               <p>[The Witness goes on to relate a Story full of Contradiction; she says the Room was always kept locked, that she did not know what was in it. First she said it was an empty Room, then she could not tell, then there were live Fowls in it, then dead Fowls; then, when questioned upon that, said there were both live and dead Fowls there, and a large Number of Rabbet Skins hung round the Room, and a great deal of her Mistress's Cloaths.]</p>

When Henderson was committed to the Gate-house, the Prisoner (Poulter) was Turnkey, there was a Box that was ordered to be searched for at the Wife's Lodgings of the Footman, who has suffered. Poulter (the Prisoner) was sent to bring this Box; when the Box was examined, there was these Things missing that had been lost, the Rings mentioned in the Indictment, and the Pearl Necklace. This Poulter (the Prisoner) if our Instructions are true, charged the Colonel with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050015"/> secreting these Goods. It is surprizing, that a Reflection of this Kind should be cast upon the Colonel, when at the same Time this Man had the Goods in his Possession.

               <p>Q. Had you any Dealings with him at any Time? What did you buy of him?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. Forty-nine Pearls, and three Diamond Rings.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you buy them?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. I bought them the latter End of October. One of the Rings he insisted upon having again, he said it was a Family-Ring. I bought two Diamonds of him, and one Socket, out of which the Diamond was taken. The Ring that he insisted upon having again, I put a Crystal in, and sent it to him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for them?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. I gave him 25 l. for the two Rings, and one Diamond.</p>
               <p>Q. What can you sell the Diamonds to a Gentleman for?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. For about 30 Guineas, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you buy any Thing else of him?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. Yes, I bought forty-nine Pearls.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you give for these?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. 4 s. 6 d. a-piece.</p>
               <p>Q. What are they worth to be sold to a Gentleman for his Lady?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. I take them to be worth 6 or 7 s. or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you an Account how he came by them?</p>
               <p>Hendrick. I had an unhappy Brother-in-law in the Gate-house at that Time; he sent me a Letter, that there was a Gentleman had some Diamonds and Pearls to sell. When I came, I said to my unhappy Brother, Who is the Gentleman? And he said, it was the Turnkey; I said, I did not care to buy of such People; he said I might, for he gave great Security, and he had married a Wife with a Fortune, and they were to take a great Inn, and they had bought fourteen Beds already, and had a Mind to part with these Things. At first he shew'd me a single Diamond; so says he, if you come in a Day or two, I shall have one bigger. Accordingly I came in a Day or two, so then he shewed me all the three, and he said one of them was a Family-Ring, that he must not part with that.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any Thing of the Woman?</p>

The Man wanted a Letter to be wrote to some Friend; whilst the Letter was writing, he asked me if I saw Mrs Poulter go out To-day dressed; I said what was she dressed in, and he spoke of the Rings; I said, that was no new Thing.

               <p>Callow. My Lord, I believe they are?</p>
               <p>Q. Is that Woman, the Prisoner, reputed to be Poulter's Wife.</p>
               <p>Callow. Yes, my Lord, she goes for his Wife; but several Women have come and claimed him for their Husband besides her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, please to ask her what that Prisoner's Name was.</p>
               <p>Callow. He is gone beyond Sea, I cannot tell his Name, but the Woman has frequently wore these things; he has often beat her for wearing them; she wore them, and has washed her Hands in them; she has threatned him, that she could swear a Smack of Robbery against him, as she used to term it.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prisoner. First in Point of Law I would submit to your Lordship, how far the Evidence can affect the Prisoner, as to make him accessory to this Felony, as receiving them, knowing them to be stolen. The Gentlemen, in the opening of the Matter, they have been pleased to say, that there were two Ingredients that went to this Matter, to induce the Court to believe the Prisoner knew these things to be stolen - The first is charging Sir

As to one Part, we shall only observe that the Prisoner went with the Constable to take care of Henderson, as he was his Prisoner, the Constable went with him, and brought the Box corded before the Justice. The Prisoner further urges in his Favour, to shew his Innocency, that he did not know these things to be stolen; that from the first Time he found the things, she wore them constantly.</p>

Henderson confessed that he had stolen them, and that the little Box was put into the great Box.

             had?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Yes, my Lord. I went into the Prisoner's House on Monday, I think about three Weeks ago.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day, or the Night?</p>
               <p>Wilson. About 12 o'Clock in the Day, and she was at Dinner. I brought her some Cloaths to wash of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you wash your own Cloaths?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, my Lord; when I came in, she desired me to dine with her, but I refused, but she desired I would; so I sat down, so in comes a Woman that she called Mrs Stiff; it was that Woman that gave her these Things to pawn. I do not know that these are they, but Mrs Stiff desired her to pawn half a Dozen of Spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them?</p>
               <p>Wilson. No, my Lord, I did not see them, she pulled them out of her Bosom; she said they were Salt-Shovels. I was for going away, but she desired I might stay till she returned; when she came back, she said the Things were stopp'd, she carried them she said to one Mrs Stringer. The Prisoner desired she would go along with her to Mrs Stringer, and let her know how she came by them. Mrs Stiff was very angry that they should stop the Things, and asked Mrs Burn if she knew any Ill of her; Mrs Burn said, no; with that she went out and said, she would fetch the Person she had them of, and would come back again and fetch them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Mrs Stiff?</p>
               <p>Wilson. That I cannot tell, my Lord; I staid almost an Hour, and the Woman did not return.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you so to remember this Woman's Name?</p>
               <p>Wilson. Mrs Burn came to me again, and said she had been looking for her; Mrs Stringer told me in her Shop, that she knew Mrs Burn to be an honest Woman, and she would not stop her, but desired she might see and get the Person that gave her the Shovels. I returned and told Mrs Burn what she said; that is all I know of the Matter.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050022"/>Q. Where were the Hats when you lost them?</p>
               <p>Harris. The Prisoner at the Bar came to my House in Butcher hall lane, to bring him a Sample of Hats to the South Sea Coffee-house; accordingly I went with them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Prisoner before?</p>
               <p>Harris. I never saw him before that Time. As I went into the Coffee House, there was a Gentleman that saw me go in. I stopp'd to the Door to have some Conversation with him, and I left the Hats upon the Table in the Coffee-house, with this Man, the Prisoner. I saw him come out with them in his Hand, as I stood at the Door talking I did not go after him - I did not suspect him - I thought he was going to shew them to some Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after you brought the Hats to the Coffee house that he came out with them?</p>
               <p>Harris. About three or four Minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you that you did not ask him what he was about to do with them?</p>
               <p>Harris. I had no Suspicion he was so handsomely dress'd, with a laced Waistcoat, and handsome Wigg, &amp;c I stayed three or four Hours, but he did not return I enquired of the Coffee-house People, and they knew nothing of him; and I heard afterwards at the Exchange, that he was gone to Holland, he was dress'd in a laced Waistcoat, and Spencer Wig, and a good Coat, and a laced Hat</p>
               <p>Q. Had you never seen him before?</p>
               <p>Harris. No; I went to several, and enquired if they knew of one Samson Hendrick. About six Weeks ago I was enquiring after him; and I heard he used a House in Covent Garden, I think they call it Lady Mordington's, a Gaming house; I went there, and there I found him, so I spoke to him; he said if I would go down Stairs he would talk with me; he came down and spoke to me; he said if you will stay a little, a Friend and I will come and speak to you. I went to get a Constable, the mean Time he got away, and was stopp'd by a Chairman; and when I came back, the Man told me he was before the Justice, the Justice committed him for further Examination the next Day, the next Day I appeared, he said he was very sorry, but he was in Liquor the Night before, and he did not know me. He said he had a Suit of Cloaths in Pawn, and a laced Hat, or a Coat and a laced Hat in Pawn, for two Guineas; he would give me that if I would not prosecute him. I told him I would not do any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain of the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Harris. Yes, my Lord, I am sure he is the same Person.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. Have you any Questions to ask?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I was brought before Justice Burdus the 27th of October, and I was committed for further Examination the 23 d. This is the Man that brought the Order from the Justice, to bring me before his Worship. At the Corner of the Street, says he, Mr Hendrick, Is it not better to make up this Affair? There was another Fellow with him at the same Time, says he, I have no more Remark to hang a Jew than a common Dog in the Street. Says he, if you will give me a Guinea, I will go and tell the Justice I do not know you. I said I tell you what I will do, seeing you are determined to prosecute me right or wrong, I says I will give you my Cloaths, and go home naked: he says, send away to your Friends and get a Guinea, and I will not prosecute you. In the Morning he told the Justice, he could not swear to the Prisoner; at the Evening, the Justice on that Account was for discharging me; he said, pay do not, I have look'd at him again, and I will now swear to him. The Prisoner, for the Truth of his Affections in Part, referred the Court to Justice Burdus's Clerk, who was present.</p>
               <p>Q. to - Brogdon. Do you remember this Matter of the Prisoner's being brought before Mr Burdus?</p>
               <p>Brogdon. When the Prosecutor gave his first Information, he pretended first, that he delivered these Goods to the Man, afterwards the Man run away with them, and he did not see him; then afterwards he said, he turned his Back, and the Hats were gone. He was asked if there was no body else, then he said there were many; then he said, that he saw him go out, afterwards he wanted to get Money of him to make it up. I heard him speak backward and forwards, and desired him to go and make it up afterwards. He came the next Time again, and said he could not believe that he was the Man; then he talked again, that the Man had confessed at St Martin's, that he did the Robbery, therefore he insisted upon the Prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. Where have you been for two or three Years past?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, I have not been out of England since I was six Years old: my Business is in Exchange-Alley, I use Exchange Alley daily. I can prove it that I have been every Day in the City or out of the City.</p>
               <p>Q. to Harris What do you say to the Account Mr Brogdon gives? He says you were in half a dozen Stories.</p>
               <p>Harris. I insisted at first that he was the Person.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoner. What Prison was you in?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. At the Gate house, my Lord.</p>

            . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Parry. I have seen him two or three Times. I saw him when he was confined in Newgate; he was under an Arrest, in an Action of Debt.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Sum he owed?</p>
               <p>Parry. About 40 l. and the Gentlewoman (his Creditor) Mrs Portland, she had committed the Management of that Affair to me; to offer me some Satisfaction, he sent me several Messages, he desired me very much to come to him, by the Letter, telling me he had something to offer that might be satisfactory; at length I did go to him, then it was he offered me this Note; he offerrd it as a collateral Security; he said he had no Money to pay the Debt, or any Part of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you received it of him?</p>
               <p>Parry. Yes, Sir, he gave me this Note as a collateral Security for the Use of Mrs Portland.</p>
               <p>Q. What Conversation had you upon the Note?</p>
               <p>Parry. I hesitated a little at first about the taking it, not that I suspected a Forgery; but because the Drawer of the Note, and the Endorser, were both utterly Strangers to me. I knew nothing of either of them. I thought that it might be worth nothing, therefore I did not know whether it might be any Security at all or no. I asked him if it was a Note that he had fairly come by, or something to that Purpose; he told me it was; then I expressed my Doubt, as not knowing the Drawer, or the Endorser; at Length I did agree to take the Note, not in any great Confidence of recovering any Money upon it. I looked upon the Debt as desperate, and I thought I might as well take that as his own Security. He told me that Baptita Zannier was Purveyor to the British Forces abroad, and there was Money due to him from the Government. I did not accept of the Note as Payment, nor would I be liable to raise Money by it.</p>
               <p>Q How long was it after the Note was given to you, that you took his Bond?</p>
               <p>Parry I believe about two or three Days, he was discharged upon giving the Bond.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire any thing after the Endorser?</p>
               <p>Parry. No, I did not, because I expected so little from the Note.</p>
               <p>Council for the Defendant. Sir, I think when you had Discourse with De la Fountain, that you had no Suspicion of it's being forged?</p>
               <p>Parry. I asked him if it was a fair and honest Note; he said it was. He said that he had it from Mrs

               <p>Ryley. Yes, very well, I have received near an 100 Letters from him, so that I believe 'tis not his Hand writing, neither is it spelled as he commonly spells his Name. I believe this Note is an Attempt to counterfeit his writing, but not his writing.</p>
               <p>Court Give the Reason why you believe that 'tis not his Hand.</p>
               <p>Ryley. The cut of the Letters is not so stiff as his real Hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the only Reason why you think that 'tis not his Hand-writing, because 'tis not so stiff?</p>
               <p>Ryley. The Letters are straighter wrote than those he writes; he writes in an outlandish Hand, but writes it very well.</p>

               <p>- Lameneer. [ Answers by an Interpreter.] Ask him if he ever saw Zannier write?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How often?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. Very often.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you believe this to be the writing of Zannier?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. I can't absolutely say whether it is his signing or not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe it to be his writing?</p>
               <p>Interpreter. He says there is a great Appearance, but he can't absolutely affirm it.</p>
               <p>Q. Ask him whether he believes that to be his Hand, or he believes that it is not his Hand?</p>

               <p>Interpreter. He cannot testify the one nor the other.</p>

               <p>Interpreter. Many Times. I have seen him write often.</p>

               <p>Interpreter. He believes that to be of his signing.</p>
               <p>Court. Ask him this Question, Whether he believes that to be Zannier's Hand writing or not?</p>

            . Did you ever see this Zannier write?</p>
               <p>Daniel. I have seen him write very often, both abroad and in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe, Sir, this Note to be the writing of Zannier or not? [This old Gentleman looked very carefully over the Note, then the Question was put to him again.] Well, Sir, can you form any Judgment?</p>
               <p>Daniel. I believe it is Zannier's Hand disguised; the first Part is altered, the latter Part grows more fluently, and more like his Hand, when I compare it with a Letter from him; besides I have heard frequently that he writes his Name, when it is of no Import, then he writes only his Sirname; and when he writes his Sirname, then he abridges Batist, and at Length Baptista.</p>
               <p>Q. Sir, I ask you whether or know you do believe that 'tis Zannier's, or 'tis not?</p>
               <p>Daniel. My Lord, I do believe it is, though I believe 'tis disguised in Part.</p>
               <p>Q. Let me know your Reason why you think it disguised?</p>
               <p>Daniel. The first Part seems to be writ steadily, and with a Design to alter his Hand; then when he goes to the latter End, then he comes more freely.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason can you give why he should disguise his Hand?</p>
               <p>Daniel. I will give you my Opinion about it; I know the Man so well, as perhaps most do, he has been a Cheat in every Thing; he is a Man of a bad Character, and may be capable of counterfeiting and disguising his own Hand.</p>

               <p>Q. Upon what Account did you go with her to Newgate?</p>
               <p>Stephens. She called at my House, and she desired me to go a little Way with her to see a Friend in Distress; so I waited on her, and went with her to Newgate, and it was to Captain De la Fountain.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it you saw her do in Newgate?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I saw her endorse the Backside of the Note, and give it to the Prisoner at the Bar, and said in broken English, I give you this to get your Discharge, and this Note is as good as the Bank. That is all that I know of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Money?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Two hundred and twenty Pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. For what Purpose was it that she endorsed or gave the Note to Mr. De la Fountain? I suppose it was in a friendly Manner, as he was an Acquaintance of her's for some Years. Was there an Intimacy and Friendship between De la Fountain and Legrand?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Yes, she was a foreigner, she lodged at my House for two Months in Queen-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where she is now?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I heard that she was gone to France.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen Mr De la Fountain before you went to Newgate?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Never in my Life</p>
               <p>Q. What Business did Mrs Legrand follow?</p>
               <p>Stephens. She appeared as a Gentlewoman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her in Company with Zannier?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Mrs Legrand any thing to supply Zannier for this Note?</p>
               <p>Stephens. She had no Goods or Business at all; I never saw Zannier.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you live?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I live at No. 3. in Prescot-street; I am Partner with my Brother.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. Stephens, you told us before, you lived at Bull-Wharf in Thames-Street, had two or three Houses of your own, that you let two, and lodged with the other Tenant youself. Now let us know the Names of your Tenants.</p>
               <p>Stephens. Phillips and Sharp.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of your Tenants did you lodge with?</p>
               <p>Stephens. At the hither one.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050027"/>Q. What is his Name?</p>
               <p>Stephens. I told you Phillips.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you receive the last Rent?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Why I have sold them; I have employed threescore Men for three Years together in Fleet street.</p>
               <p>Council Canst tell me any of the Names of the Parish-Officers that you paid your Taxes to? What is the Minister's Name of the Parish? Tell me the Name of any one Person that was a Parish-Officer while thou hadst these House, before thou soldest them? What Rent did they pay?</p>
               <p>Stephens. One went at 16 l. and the other at 7.</p>
               <p>Council. Who were Tenants of those Houses?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Phillips is one, and Sharp the other. My Father left them to me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell the three for?</p>
               <p>Stephens. Sharp gave me 70 l. for the three.</p>
               <p>Council. Where did you live when Mrs Legrand lodged with you?</p>
               <p>Stephens. At the Corner where my Father did.</p>
               <p>Council for the Prosecution. If such Doctrines and Evidences had not been advanced, that I never heard before, I should have no Occasion to give you any Trouble. It is an amazing Thing to me, that in proving the Hand now before you, which is wrote more regular and large than any one that has been produced, &amp;c. The learned Gentleman says, he thinks it is his Hand-writing disguised, because the End looks as if it were real, and the Beginning and Middle bad. Would not the Party, would he not have taken care that it should have been written proper? The Bond and Powers that are produced, they are as convincing Evidence, that it cannot be his real Hand; they are not spelt the same, not turned the same. It shews the Man wrote an even, regular Hand in general; and how he could be induced to write so now, is very strange. This wicked Witness you have called up, how, when the Man has prevaricated as he has done, whether he is a Man to be credited or no? The last Time he was examined here, it was enquired where he lived; he then gave an Account it was at Bull-Wharf; there was no such Person ever there, Landlord or Tenant. What do they make further? why, that Mrs Legrand, the French Gentlewoman, came into Newgate, and this Fellow is so hard as to say, he saw the Woman write the Name Legrand while she was in Newgate. These Gentlemen are more fortunate than other People, that Ladies should be so much in Love with them. I do not know any thing so charming they could see in his Face, to induce them to do such Favours as these. Our Inquiry is after Truth. I desire nothing that may bear hard against him.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the Place they met you?</p>
               <p>Todd. In Compton-street, they followed me all up the Street.</p>
               <p>Q. Which of them?</p>
               <p>Todd. That Soldier with the Handkerchief about his Head (Wilkins)</p>
               <p>Q. Well, what did he do?</p>
               <p>Todd. He followed me up Compton-street; now and then he gave me a Jobb with a Stick, and he waited for the other to come to him several Times, and called him.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say?</p>
               <p>Todd. I think he called him Tom, then they went and stood at the Watch-house at the End of Wood's-Close; he stood there and called for the other, then they both came up and stood under the Golden Fleece Window, and there was another Gentleman that was coming to London, or going to Islington, and he went into my Lord Cobham's; so these Soldiers they went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050028"/> and stood at the Turk's-head Field gate; I saw them stand there, and I turned again, and as I was turning back again, the Soldier he run after me, he with an Handkerchief about his Head ( Wilkins ) he ran after me, and overtook me, and throwed me down, and took the Things from me.</p>
               <p>Q. What Things?</p>
               <p>Todd. The scarlet Gown, and Snuff coloured Breeches, and another wrapped up in a Cloth Bag, they took and slung them into the Ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all the Things?</p>
               <p>Todd. And a coloured Handkerchief, they flung them into the Ditch, and afterwards jump'd in, and took them out, and away they run.</p>
               <p>Court. You say but one took away the Things from you?</p>
               <p>Todd. It was he with the Handkerchief slung them into the Ditch, then jump'd in and took them out, and ran away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any more than one?</p>
               <p>Todd. There was two at the Turk's-head Gate, but there was but one that meddled with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you when they met with you?</p>
               <p>Todd. I was under the Turk's head Window, they stood both together at the Field-gate when I saw them; but whether the other Man went away, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. But as it was dark, how do you know they are them?</p>
               <p>Todd. By their Tallness they are the same.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see them afterwards? You saw the Soldier jump into the Ditch, and took up the Bundle that he took from you, and run away Now go on: What followed after this? Do you live at Islington?</p>
               <p>Todd. Yes, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Was no body with you?</p>
               <p>Todd. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an Account when these Men run away. What did you do?</p>
               <p>Todd. Sir, I cried out Murder! stop Thieves! I ran down as far as the Turnpike, and the Turnpike-man catched the Soldier.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed after this?</p>
               <p>Todd. The other Soldier was catched, (he with the Handkerchief about his Head) and swore that I was his Sister.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do after this, you say both the Soldiers were taken? What became of them?</p>
               <p>Todd. Sir, they were catched, and I went before the Justice that Night, and the Justice was not at Home I believe; and I went before the Justice the next Morning, the Gentlemen went with me.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not very dark between six and seven o'Clock?</p>
               <p>Todd. I could see their Cloaths, but I did not mind their Faces.</p>
               <p>Court. You say there was but one that meddled with you?</p>
               <p>Todd. No, and he had his Hair on then.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that's the Soldier?</p>
               <p>Todd. He has cut his Hair off. I look'd at him as I was on the Ground, and cried out Murder. I was frightened; I was afraid they were about to kill me.</p>

            , otherwise Roberson, take the Bundle from underneath the Girl as she lay upon the Ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the Man before?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that's the Man?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. Yes, my Lord, I am sure that is him that has the Handkerchief about his Head. After he had robbed the Girl, he run into the Road; I pursued him with the Bundle under his Arm, down to the Turnpike and back again, almost to the Place where he committed the Robbery, then he dropped the Bundle in the Road, thinking that I might stop to take it up, but I let it lay, and pursued him. Just as he was entering into Wood's Close Field, I, with the Assistance of another Gentleman, took him and carried him into my Lord Cobham's, which is a Publick-house; we were there about five or six Minutes, and he went out along with the Constable, and shewed him were he dropped the things; the Bundle lay where he dropped it. The other Prisoner, Cobb, he came in, alledging that Wilkins was drunk, and he said the Girl was his Sister, and that he had been beating of her, because she would not do as he would have her. Then, my Lord, we asked Wilkins if he knew this Cobb, he said no, he did not know him; and we asked Cobb whether he knew Wilkins, he said yes, he had known him two or three Years, and had been in his Company a great many Times. So, my Lord, we searched Cobb, and took an Hanger away from him; that is all, my Lord, I know of the Affair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cobb at any Time before he came into the House?</p>
               <p>Vaughan. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Prisoners. Will either of you ask this Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050029"/>Cobb. He never saw me before I came into that House.</p>
               <p>Court. Well, he does not say that he did.</p>
               <p>- Barnes. As I was coming to Town the 25th of October.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with Vaughan?</p>
               <p>Barnes. Yes, about the Distance of three Yards before we came to my Lord Cobham's, I saw the Prisoner with the Handkerchief about his Head, take the Bundle from under the Girl, and immediately he jumped into the Ditch, and then into the Road, and made towards the Turnpike; Mr Vau ghan after him directly to the Road; and I went towards the Turnpike. Just about the Place where he took it from the Girl, there he dropped it; he turned to the Right, near Wood's Close, and Vaughan took hold of the Flap of his Coat: the Noise of the Girl alarmed the House, and Mr Hayward came out of the House, upon that he collared him, and Vaughan said this is he. Hayward said, You Villain, how could you serve the Child so? says Wilkins, be a Friend to me, and I will tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the Child?</p>
               <p>Barnes. The Girl stood under the Window when I left her; when Wilkins said, be a Friend to me, Hayward said we will, if you will shew us the things, with that he went out, and showed him; with that the other Prisoner, Cobb, came in, and said the Prisoner Wilkins was in Liquor, let him go about his Business. Some other Gentlemen in the House said, How should you know he was in Liquor, unless you were an Accomplice with him? They insisted upon his being secured as well as the other. The other Prisoner (Cobb) stood about the Distance of a Yard and a half from the Girl, when the Prisoner Wilkins took the things from her, but I did not see him do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you know it was he?</p>
               <p>Barnes. My Lord, I never lost Sight of him.</p>
               <p>Court. You have told us that you know Wilkins, but how did you know the other Prisoner Cobb?</p>
               <p>Barnes. I can't swear to his Face. He had a great blue Coat on; and the Person that came in, that said Wilkins was in Liquor, I can take upon me to swear, that that is the Person that stood up against the House. Then we had them before a Magistrate, and there was an Hanger found upon Cobb.</p>

               <p>Hayward. I was at the House of Mr Taunton's, at my Lord Cobham's Head, on Saturday the 25th of October last, where I heard an Out cry of Murder repeated two or three Times; immediately after added, Stop Thief. There were several Gentlemen in the Room. I said, Gentlemen, will no-body go to the Assistance of this Person?</p>
               <p>Q. What was the cry?</p>
               <p>Hayward. The Voice of a Girl. I said, Will none of you go to the Assistance of this Person? Upon which Mr Greenwood, the Constable, immediately turned out of the Door along with me; when we came out, there was a Person running up the Road, crying Stop him, Stop him, this is one; upon which I ran up the Causeway; this Mr Vaughan pursued him, and brought him as it were into my Arms. I saw the Girl. I said, You sorry Villain, how could you meddle with this Child? Where are the things you have taken from her? Upon which I led him into the House, and I told him, if he would tell me where the things were that he had taken from the Child, he should go about his Business; he then, my Lord, begged that I would stand his Friend, and if I would, he would go and shew me where the things were; upon which I led him out by the Collar, and he went across the Way into the high Road, and there the Bundle lay; and I took it up, and we brought him back into the House; as I was bringing him into the House, the Prisoner, Cobb, was standing under the Window; and he says to me, let the Fellow go, for he is in Liquor, he is fuddled, and said that the Girl was his Sister, and because the little B - h would not do as he would have her, he had pushed her down, and that was all, so desired that I would let him go; so we charged the Constable with them both, and we went before the Justice the next Morning; the Night when we went to the Justice's, he was not in the Way; I sent to one of the Under-keepers of Bridewell, and he asked if we had search'd them, we said no; upon which we searched them and found the Hanger.</p>

Please you, my Lord, I was going from Islington, and was very much in Liquor, and meeting this Girl in the Causeway, I pushed this Girl down, and the Bundle falls into the Ditch; then she cried out, stop Thief; then there was some Gentlemen coming along, and they laid hold of me and said, this is the Man.</p>

               <p>Cobb. My Lord, as I was getting up on Saturday Morning, this young Fellow says to me, will you take a Walk? I goes with him to Islington, and we spent some Time playing two or three Games at Cards.</p>
               <p>Court. If I understand you right, you and your Comrade had been playing at Cards about three; but when did you Part?</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any thing further to say? Will you call any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Cobb. When my Comrade was taken, I heard a Disturbance; I goes into the Yard, and that little Man with a black Wig he catches me by the Collar, and said I was one of his Confederates; whereupon he takes my Hanger from my Side, and my Stick out of my Hand.</p>
               <p>Court. Here is one of the Witnesses saw you standing within a Yard and half of the other Prisoner, when the Bundle was taken from the Girl. Have you any Witnesses?</p>
               <p>Court. Hayward, do you observe what Cobb said, that Wilkins (the Prisoner) was in Liquor? What did you observe of it?</p>
               <p>Hayward. The young Fellow appeared to me to be in Liquor, he begged that I would be a Friend to him, that he never did any such Thing before, but the other Prisoner (Cobb) put him upon it. This is going farther than I did before.</p>

               <p>Q. What Lodgings did you let her?</p>
               <p>Reddish. A Two-Pair of Stairs Room, backward, at two Shillings a Week.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it furnished?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she give you no Notice of going?</p>
               <p>Reddish. No, my Lord, she left my Lodgings the 25th of November, I had a Suspicion she had taken out my things before I took her up. I found a Pair of Blankets, a Pillow, a Pair of Sheets, and a Looking Glass, gone at the Time that I took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose Goods were all these?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Mine, my Lord. Last Monday I missed two Curtains, they were Cheeny.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say when you took her?</p>
               <p>Reddish. When I went before the Justice, she said, if you will have Mercy on me, I will tell you of your things. I said, Mrs Lever you have used me barbarously before, for I have lost a great many things since you have come into my House.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was her Husband?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Her Husband has been there, I think I have seen him, but I never saw him there but once.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him there?</p>
               <p>Reddish. I believe about three or four Months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any thing more to say?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Here is a Paper she gave me as a Direction where she had pawned them; but after I was gone, she said I should not find them there; when I went to the Pawnbroker, he said he could not tell if there was any such things, she must come herself.</p>
               <p>Court. Prisoner, will you ask her any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She lays more to my Charge than I am guilty of. Her Husband broke open the Door upon me - I never left her Lodgings.</p>

             and the Constable; and before the Justice, she (the Prisoner) confessed she had pawned the Blankets for 8 s. the Pillow for 1 s. and Looking-glass for 1 s. and the Pair of Sheets for 2 s. with that the Prisoner at the Bar said to Mr Reddish, you have Children of your own, take Compassion on me, and I'll tell you where the things are; if you will go to the Golden-Ball there you will find these things. I went with Mrs Reddish to that Pawnbroker, but could not find them; we came back again to the Prisoner to know why she had made such a Fool of her: she said they were pawned to another Woman, and she would not tell her without giving her a Discharge.</p>
               <p>Q. to Reddish. Were all these things in your Room?</p>
               <p>Reddish. Yes, my Lord; the same night the Prisoner was taken up, I was with her Husband, I told him the Prisoner at the Bar was about to be sent to Newgate; he said he was sorry for it.</p>

               <p>Archer. I had a Trunk stood in my Room, and I found my Trunk broke open the 25th of May; I went before Justice De Veil, and got a Warrant, and searched her Trunk, and found the Gold Ring, a Silver Girdle-buckle, one Yard of Holland, two Yards of Lace, a Cap, a Pair of Stockings, some yellow Silk, four or five Pair of white Stockings, about an Ounce of Silk, and a Frock; all these were in the Trunk, the Sheets were not, my Lord; the Sheets she had made off, I got this Silk I found upon her, and this Pair of Stockings, and this is my Callico she had made into a Frock for her Child. She had broke open the Box three or four Months before; I being a Servant, she got to the Constable before me, and got her Discharge; and Yesterday was three Weeks I got a Warrant and took her up; I found this the 26th of May, I found that Frock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it in a Frock when you lost it?</p>

            , my Lord, it was in loose Callico, the Prisoner had wore it two or three Months before I knew any thing of the Matter - This she had left in the Trunk. About March last I went to take out something I wanted, which was a Piece of Holland;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050034"/> when I went to put the Key into the Trunk, I said I was hurt. She goes by several Names.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you live?</p>
               <p>Archer. I lived with Mr South, a Brewer; the Room she was in was my Room, that I had let to her for ten Months.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you observe your Trunk was first broke open?</p>
               <p>Archer. As near as I can remember, it was in March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any Thing upon the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Archer. I found the Ring upon her in her Box in my Room, this Frock, this Silk, and Stockings; which, when I claimed, she said they were her Husband's.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss the Callico?</p>
               <p>Archer. It was the 25th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you not to take her up before November ? You say you did not take her up again till November.</p>
               <p>Archer. No, my Lord, by reason I was in Place, and could not have Time to attend such a troublesome Affair.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has she been committed?</p>
               <p>Archer. I think the 14th of November.</p>
               <p>Q to the Prisoner. Would you have me ask the Witness any Questions?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My Lord, she says she found that in the Room in my Box; my Lord, I had no Box there.</p>
               <p>Q. to Archer. The Box that you found the Things in, was it the Prisoner's?</p>
               <p>Archer. She borrowed it of one Mary - .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that Person might not put the Things in?</p>
               <p>Archer. My Lord, if she can prove that; my Lord, when the Constable was there, she threatened me, and asked how I dared to take her Box, and threatened to hit me a Slap in the Face.</p>

The Prisoner told my Wife, that she was a Wet-nurse, that her Husband had took the Child she had put to nurse out, and would not let her know where it was. All that she wanted of him, was to know where the Child was; she told him, if he would allow her 4 s a Week, which he then gave to another, she would not trouble him any more. Her Husband comes the next Morning, and asked if the Prisoner was come there, and said, when she comes, I must beg of you to stop her, because I have got three or four Persons to swear a Robbery against her; he said, a d - d B - h, if I can get her hanged or transported, she cannot trouble me any more.</p>

               <p>Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner at the Bar?</p>
               <p>Mott. My Lord, she lodged at our House, and lodging at our House, she seemed to be frightened one Night, and desired I might lie with her; so she got into Bed, I got into Bed first - I got into Bed, and laid next to the Wall; so she said to me, let us take away the Sheet, I always do in cold Weather, because the Cold should not come to my Feet. The next Morning I goes into my Father's Room to lock the Door where my Mother lay; when she came down Stairs, she desired me to lock her Door, next Door to her's. Mother called me down Stairs to the Shop, and Mother being busy, this Prisoner got up in the Morning, and desired my Mother to let me go with her to an Aunt of her's. My Mother asked her to drink a Dish of Coffee, she said she was in a Hurry.</p>

               <p>Mott. My Lord, I believe it was before eight.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you go with her?</p>
               <p>Mott. She went through Courts and Places I did not know where; she had me to an Alehouse, and called for a Pint of Drink, and said she would come to me presently; then she comes back again, and said, she had been at her Aunt's. She asked if I would drink a Glass of Wine; I would have went with her to her Aunt's, she said her Aunt was coming there to be merry.</p>

I staid there three or four Hours, and I went home and told my Father how she had served me; when I came home, my Father got a Ladder, and got in at the Window. My Father did not open the Casement till the Evening; she was with Child then.</p>
               <p>Court. It was pretty early for you to know that she was with Child then. Well, what then?</p>

So he went home with her about a 11 o'Clock, yesterday was three Weeks; the next Morning he asked if she was come there, I said no, so he said when she came, he desired I would stop her; he said if he could but hang her or transport her, he should get rid of her, so I desired that he would get out of the House, we did not desire such Company. It has cost me near 3 l. purely to serve the Woman, as we believe it to be a Prosecution set on Foot by the Malice and Wickedness of her Husband.</p>

            . My Lord, I have lived in this House, that is, Mrs Rawlins's, since March last, this Woman that keeps the House, is a very unfortunate Woman, and often out of her Senses, and often intoxicated with Liquor; she has often pressed me to buy her Goods, I always refused, and said I would not do it unless she would bring her Friends; her Sister in Tavistock street with her Friends, they desired I would take these Goods into my own Hands. I have advanced some little Matters from Time to Time merely out of Compassion to her, and I have supported her from my own Table. About the 22d of October, a Lawyer and the Prisoner (Goff) comes to the House, pretending to have an Execution; the Lawyer comes bullying into the the House, Sir, says he, if you will give me to much Money, you shall have these Goods, for I have an Execution, and I have brought an Appraiser. Though he had no Execution, yet be disturbed and frightened us; he rushes in with these Prisoners, and demands the Goods away; he came in in the most audacious Manner with inexcreable Oaths, the Woman, Mrs Rawlins, comes to me and says, for the Sake of God release me out of the Hands of these Villains! He says to her, You old B - h I spoke to God Almighty this Morning, and he said he never made you. I never heard such Profaneness in all my Life; at last, Sir, says he, pay me 20 l. and you shall have the Goods; upon this the Woman begged and prayed, and said, these are a Pack of Thieves and Rogues; says she, for God's Sake take the Goods, and pay their Demands; I paid him five Guineas, and Goff (the Prisoner) started up and said, I must have three Guineas, she owes me three Guineas in going of Errands for her, &amp;c. She hauls out and said, he is a Rogue, and has lived upon me, and I do not owe him any thing. After the Lawyer had made a Bill of Sale to me, and I had paid Part of the Money, we went abroad to spend the Day; upon our Return, Goff and Oldfield (the Prisoners) had taken Possession of the House, and swearing I should not come in, unless I would pay them 15 l. I applied to the Civil Magistrate, I got a Warrant; the Constable said, you had as good go to the Officer of the Guard, and get a File of Musqueteers, which I did, and forced open the Street door, and these two Fellows (the Prisoners) bounced out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174612050039"/> my Bed, I went up Stairs, and I saw Mr Storaca's Door broke open, and he said he had lost six Guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. to - . Are you an Attorney?</p>
               <p>- . Yes; Mr M Allester sent for me, in order to advise with me what to do upon the Lawyer's coming in the Manner he has represented it; I, in the first Place, advised him to have nothing to do with it. but Mrs Rawlins advised him to take it upon himself; upon which there was an Agreement made: But besides the Money that the Lawyer had paid on Mrs Rawlins's Account, he set up another Demand for Business done. I asked him for a Bill, but he said he would lump it, and did behave, I must own, in a most extraordinary Way that ever I saw in my Life. At the same Time these Things were executed, the Key was delivered by the Lawyer to Mr Mc Allester, by Mrs Rawlins's Direction.</p>
               <p>Q. to the Lawyer. How came all this seizing of Goods?</p>
               <p>Lawyer. Mrs Rawlins applied to me some Time before October last, in order to sue Mr Mc Allester and Storaca, she said she was in barbarous Hands, several Times she had applied to Mr Mc Allester, and he said he could not pay her. This Mr Mc Allester pretends to say, that he is an Attorney, I said to him, do not enter into a Law-suit; I sent to him to come to me, he came to my Apartment, and he said to me, pray do not distress me; I said any Time before Term would do for me. Says Mrs Rawlins, I am very uneasy Mc Allester shuffles with me, I am under some Danger of their moving some of their Goods, and it appeared that they had moved off some of them; upon that, the Goods were to be appraised, and I was to advance some Money to pay her Landlord; upon that, the 17th of October, they were appraised ( Mr Mc Allester thinking himself greatly injured, that he should lose his Character in England, as well as he had in Ireland) the Landlord came and seized on Saturday Night, this Mr Goff, the Prisoner at the Bar, was sent to me by the Direction of Mrs Rawlins, and told me the Goods were seized; accordingly, on the Evening of that Day, on the 19th I believe it was, I paid the Rent and Charges of that Distress, which came to 14 l. 7 s. 10 d. besides other Charges, as eating and drinking at the Hollander, Carlisle street; accordingly I paid it, and took the Men out of the Possession. Mrs Rawlins came to me the Monday following, says she, Mr Mc Allester has not paid me; I wrote a Letter to him, and told him if he did not pay the Money, I would sue him; then he told me he had a Receipt in full of Mrs Rawlins, I went and asked Mrs Rawlins, and she said she did not give him a Receipt in full; I said, knowing the Person, it might be of bad Consequences and Arrest, Mrs Rawlins said he has paid me but one Guinea, and I have not given him a Receipt in full.</p>
               <p>Court. I want to know why the 22d of October, when you was to receive the Money for the Arrest, you put these People into Possession? Why, after this Agreement that was made, did these two Men go in and nail up the Doors again? To this there was no satisfactory Answer given. This Gentleman hath said a very strange Expression against this poor Woman. You seem, Sir, to have great Choice of Words, I desire you would not make use of such any more. It is grieving to see such Oppression to those that cannot help themselves. Whether Mc Allester or the Lawyer was most her Friend, or whether it would not have been better for her if she had not been acquainted with either of them.

            . What did you lose?</p>
               <p>Brown. Seven Yards of Camblet, that was cut out of my Loom; I found my Shop broke open, I got Mr Gold to go with me to seek after the Prisoner: I suspected the Prisoner, and I went after him, he had told me where he lodged; - I went after him to a Place called King-street at Hoxton. As I was passing he spoke to me first, and I laid hold of him by the Collar, and said, you are the Man that I wanted, I have a Suspicion that you have robbed me; as I had hold of him, I desired Mr Gold to observe, that he threw nothing of his Pocket; the Prisoner pulled a Shuttle out of his Pocket, and I took hold of it, and it is the same Shuttle I lost out of my House, and there was a Pair of Pickers picked up by Gold.</p>
               <p>Q. to - Brown. Do you understand the Nature of an Oath? Have you learned your Catechism?</p>
               <p>Brown, the Father, answers, That his Son was not Book-learned.</p>
               <p>Court. What is the Reason you do not teach your Children their Catechism, &amp;c. The Neglect of Childrens Education, is the Occasion of half our Business here.</p>
               <p>Brown. My Lord, my Father went out about four o'Clock the 7th of September, about five o'Clock I locked the Shop door, and brought the Key down, and put it in the Kitchen Window.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you locked the Kitchen-Door?</p>

Yes, my Lord; I then carried the Key of the Kitchen to my Father, and came home with him about eight o'Clock, and as I went to Bed, I found the Door broke open; I called to my Father to come up, but he did not come at the first, and I said, For God's Sake come up, for the Door is broke open! When my Father came up, we missed the two Shuttles, and a Pair of Pickers, and the Camblet taken out of the Loom.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any body else left in the House?</p>
               <p>Brown. The outward Door was left upon the Latch for Gold to come in, that lodged in the House.</p>

            . As I came Home at Night, between eight and nine o'Clock. I was gone up to Bed; I hears the Boy cry out Father! Father! pray come up, for the Door is broke open; so he desired I would go with him to see after the Prisoner. We went up to Hoxton to enquire where he lodged; as we were near Hoxton square, there we met the Prisoner, he spoke first to us, and said I hope no Harm: then Mr Brown said, you are the Man I want, and took hold of him by the Collar, and Brown desired I would look after him, to see that he did not pull any thing out of his Pocket. I saw him take the Shuttle out of his Left-hand Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Gold. So Mr Brown took hold of it with his Right-Hand; then we went about 20 Yards, and there was a Pair of Pickers thrown down; but when he threw them down, I cannot say. I picked them up, and Mr Brown said he could swear that that they were his Pickers. The Stuff was delivered to the Constable by

               <p>Prisoner. I worked at his House for about a Week. I went to see for other Work, for fear that should be gone; coming along Spital Fields, I kick'd a Sort of a Bundle before me, and picked it up, and brought it Home to my Lodgings; this Mr Brown, I told him where I lodged. I got to Hoxton, and I did not know him. I was a little in Liquor, so he carried me to the Watch house, the next Morning to the Constable's House; carrying me to the Constable's, he would have made it up with my Mother for 30 s. at last he fell down to 20 s. so she would have gave him 15 s. if she sold her Bed from under her.</p>
