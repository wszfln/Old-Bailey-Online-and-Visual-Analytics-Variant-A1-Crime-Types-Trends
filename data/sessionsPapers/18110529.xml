               <p>Q. In Norton-street you had a sale of books - A. I had, in August last.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any of them books remain unsold - A. Yes, they did, and they remained in the care of the prisoner. There was a quantity of paper brought in for the purpose of papering the house while he was there; the house at that time was under repair.</p>
               <p>Q. After the books were placed under his care did you miss any of them - A. I did. From information I told the prisoner he must either submit to have his lodgings searched, or go to Bow-street; he said search his lodgings; I went with the prisoner to his lodgings, accompanied with a cabinet maker in my employ. I searched his lodgings, we found several quantities of printed paper, and some printed borderings, and there were also some boxes covered with the same kind of paper. On the 5th of January I searched his lodgings again, Humphreys the officer was with me, we found the door fast, the officer looked through the key hole, he saw a man there, and demanded entrance; upon that the door was opened, the prisoner was there, and another man; there were two books found in the room under the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the two books that you found under the bed left under the care of the prisoner in your house in Norton-street - A. Yes, they were.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had this man been in your employ - A. From the month of 
               <persName id="t18110529-1-person54">August.</persName>
             I gave him two pounds nine shillings a week for the greater part of the time he was there.</p>
               <p>CHARLES HUMPHREYS. I am an officer. I accompanied Mr. Gibbons to search the prisoner's room on the floor, under the bed. I found these two books, I shewed them to Mr. Gibbons in the prisoner's presence; Mr. Gibbons said they were his; the prisoner said I had throwed the books there; I had not; then he said Mr. Gibbons did. Mr. Gibbons could not, he was at the other part of the room at the time. These are the books, they have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

On Monday the 6th of this month, I was on duty at the gate, between three and four o'clock in the afternoon I saw the two prisoners, they were coming towards the gate, they were walking together; they turned under a shed opposite No. 1, from that shed they could get to another; I followed them and found them under No. 11, when I came up to them they were about ten yards apart; I first seized Thompson. I felt at his coat pocket, and I felt something like coffee; I told him to stand there, and not to throw any thing away. He wanted me to let him go and to say nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the two prisoners were two <rs id="t18110529-3-deflabel13" type="occupation">Excise officer</rs>

                        targets="t18110529-3-defend60 t18110529-3-deflabel13"/>s - A. I did. I then quitted Thompson and went after Thacker.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had stopped Thompson what became of Thacker - A. He quitted the shed and got on board a ship discharging at No. 11, I followed him on board the ship, I left Thompson in the shed, and told him to stay there; he could not get out of the dock at that time. When I got up to Thacker I felt something in his coat pocket, which felt like coffee; I told him to come along with me, which he did. I brought him back to the shed where Thompson was; I took them both into one of the dock offices; I searched them both one after the other; Yardley, another constable was present. I searched Thacker first, I found a quantity of coffee in a handkerchief in his hat. This is the handkerchief and the coffee; I found part of the coffee in his coat pockets; I have put it altogether in the handkerchief; there is here what I found in the handkerchief, and I have added to it what I found in his pockets; I then searched Thompson, I found a quantity of coffee in a handkerchief in his hat, and coffee loose in both his pockets, the quantity was about six pounds. I asked Thompson how he came by it, Thacker was in the same room, he informed me that he got it from a vessel, down below, forward. I then took them to the police office.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find in your way that one of them had a knife - A. Yes, Thacker; this is it, it is a common knife.</p>
               <p>Q. The next morning did you go on board a schooner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290004"/>of the name of Madorosa - A. Yes. I had learned then that was the ship on board which they were stationed, she was lying afloat in the West India Import Dock, she had not commenced the discharge of her cargo.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down to that part of the schooner which Thompson described below, forward - A. I did; that is in the forescuttle.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel about and discover whether any coffee had been disturbed there - A. I did. There is no light permitted to be there. I found a board had been wrenched at the upper part of the bulk head. The bulk head is the partition that separates the cargo from the men's birth.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this board sufficiently open for you to put your hand in - A. It was, and when I put my hand in it found its way to a in a hole bag of coffee. I took a sample of that coffee, this is it; it appears to correspond with that found on the persons of the prisoners. The fore-scuttle was afterwards locked up until the commencement of the discharge of the cargo, which was on the 14th of May. I had chalked two bags through the hole. I attended the discharge of the cargo until they came to them bags. One bag that I had marked is marked I. S. I. 43; the other bag is marked I. S. I. 22. Both the bags appeared to be cut; the bag that I put my hand into was No. 43, and there appeared to be taken out of the bag, No. 43, from eighteen to twenty pound; and the bag No. 22, appeared to me that it would hold fourteen or fifteen pounds to fill it, it was a damaged bag; I took both the bags away, and have had them in my custody ever since, and what I took from the prisoner I have had in my custody ever since. At the police office the prisoner said it was given him by the mariners. This is the bag 43, there is a cut about eight inches, and this bag 22, there is a cut twelve inches.</p>

            . I am a constable of the London dock. On Sunday I perceived the two prisoners walking on the north Quays of the London dock, they were directly opposite No. 1, warehouse; I suspected they had something in their hats by their walk; I followed them up to the gate and stopped Smith; I asked him what he had got in his hat, he told me nothing at all; I took his hat off, and found concealed in the crown of his hat this brass sheave. The gate-keeper stopped Pipi, we searched him, and found one sheave in his hat. I then took them to the police office. After I returned to the Dock I knew the Prince of Wales came into the Dock the day before, and the head of the pins corresponded in colour with the blocks, and the blocks were without sheaves. I looked inside of the blocks, and the verdigrease corresponded exactly with that on the sheaves, they fitted exactly. I then informed the captain of it.</p>

            . I went out of the privy, I saw him take a gown out of the window in the housekeepers room; I immediately collared him and I took him into the kitchen; he pulled out a lace muslin cloak, the property of Mrs. Lowndes; he dropped the gown directly I took him in the area. These things have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>ANN WESTROP. Q On the 21st of May you were housekeeper to Mr. Lowndes - A. Yes When I went into the room I found the things missing; this gown is mine, it was in my room on the chair when I left the room. This muslin cloak is Mr. Lowndes's; these are the two pin-cushion covers, and this cloak is mine.</p>

               <p>Q. Before you went to bed did you lock up your house - A. Yes, it was all fastened, doors and windows. I then went to bed and went to sleep; I was awaked in the morning by Knowles. I immediately came down, he told me my window was open; this was between four and five; it was light; my doors were all fast; as I left them; there was a piece cut out of the shutter of the window of the foreroom that communicated with the street. The sash was propped up with the piece of wood that was cut out of the sash. I missed all the linen that was in the room, all the linen that is now produced in the bundle. It was quite light when I got up.</p>

            . I am a constable of Isleworth. I was called up by the prosecutrix, I immediately went to her house, it was between four and five o'clock; I saw that the window had been cut. I returned to Hounslow and wrote a letter to Mr. Smith the police officer, desiring him to come immediately; Smith came about two or three o'clock, and in consequence of suspicion, I went to Newton's house with Smith. Newton lives in the town, on Isleworth side, better than a mile from the prosecutrix, We apprehended Simmonds and Andrews in the street, about five or six hundred yards from Newton's house. I apprehended Andrews, he ran away from Smith; Smith laid hold of him by the collar, he struck Smith, Smith catched the bundle off his shoulder, and he ran away; I catched him, and Smith searched him, and took a pistol out of Andrews pocket; the pistol was loaded with powder and shots; he likewise took a powder flask from his pocket, and a little bag which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290006"/>contained some slugs, and likewise a knife, and there was a crape found. I did not see Simmonds apprehended, I saw him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any bundle found upon him - A. I saw them both with their bundles before we apprehended either Simmonds or Andrews. On Simmonds was found a large crooked knife, and a crape. After that we went to Newton's house; Smith I believe told him that we were come to search his house; he changed very white and trembled; I stood over him while Smith searched the house, he found several articles in the house that had been stolen from Mrs. White's house. We took Newton in custody, and at Bow-street they were examined and committed. The The first that Smith laid hold of in Newton's house, he asked me if I knew any thing of them. I said, yes, they are my boys stockings.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street office. In consequence of application by the last witness on the 18th of April I went down to Hounslow; I got there about half past three or near four o'clock, I went to Newton's house, I saw Andrews open the door, and Simmonds I saw just behind him; I went over the way and told Cook that I had some suspicion. Cook sent Mortimer over the way to watch the house, in about five minutes Mortimer came back and called Cook; I was standing at the public-house door when he came back about fifty yards off; I looked on the opposite side of the way, I saw two men going down with bundles, I did not see where they came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were the two men - A. Andrews and Simmonds, the same men which I had seen in the house. Upon my seeing them, I instantly ran of the opposite side of the way, and Mr. Cook along with me, crossed over and met them; I catched hold of Andrews at first by the collar; I conceived I had got him, but the moment I had got hold of him he hit me with his fist on the face; he gave me a second blow, and knocked me up against the wall, and ran away; he was then apprehended by Cook; I never let go the bundle that Andrews had; this is it. Simmonds likewise had a bundle, this was Simmonds's bundle. We then took them into a public-house; upon Andrews I found this pistol, it was loaded then; this is the charge that was in it; there was powder and slugs in it; I took from him a powder horn, a knife, and some crape, and a pair of pincers, in a small bag of square slugs. On Simmonds I found a small gardeners knife, and a gimblet, and this crape was in the lining of his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you gone down in the course of the day to the prosecutrix's house - A. I did, I saw the breaking, this knife might have done it; it appeared to have been cut with a knife. Immediately I had secured Simmonds and Andrews I went to Newton's house, Cook went with me. Newton was sitting in the front room when I went in, I told him I was come to search his house, the first things that I took up was a child's pair of trowsers; they were in the front room, and several other things that Mr. Cook knew to be his property. I then went into the back room, Newton's wife was there, she went up against a window; I asked her what she was at, she said, nothing. I took two handkerchiefs from her hand, they belong to Mrs. White; under some straw I found two flat irons belonging to Mrs. White; the things have been in my custody ever since.</p>
               <p>JOHN MORTIMER. I am a constable of Hesson. By the orders of Mr. Cook I watched Newton's house, I saw Andrews come out first, and look about him; he went in again, and in about five minutes Andrews and Simmonds both came out with bundles upon their shoulders. Andrews was taken by Mr. Cook. I apprehended Simmonds, I saw them searched afterwards, and the things found.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. All these things were in my house. I have seen them all. I never made any estimate of their value.</p>
               <p>Andrews' Defence. I know myself innocent of stealing the property. I went to Hesson fair; I was coming home, we lit of these things in a ditch.</p>
               <p>Simmond's Defence. The same.</p>
               <p>Newton's Defence. They were left at my house while I was out with my fish.</p>

We took all three of them to a public-house, Archer was taken into the side parlour, the other two were taken into the tap-room; Kennedy searched Archer, and when I came into the parlour I saw a quantity of copper in Kennedy's possession; I asked Archer how he came by the copper. Kennedy and Gleed were present at the time; he said he had taken it from his mother; he afterwards said that Beazely had told him to go, and shove the door of the turnpike house in, and on the window he would find the copper; he said he had told Beazeley he was afraid to do that, Beazeley then told him to shove the window back, and take the halfpence out, which he did.</p>

            . I am a police officer of Worship-street. On this evening I was with Armstrong near the turnpike gate, I did not see Kemlin until Armstrong saw him. I heard a whistle, that whistle was answered by another whistle; I was about twenty or thirty yards from the turnpike gate; I saw them when they were apprehended, they appeared to be conversing together, and Kemlin ran away; as soon as Armstrong came up, he, in the first instance, stopped Archer, and put him up against the wall; I took hold of Archer, Kemlin ran away; Rice, Armstrong, and Gleed pursued him; I took Archer into the Swan public-house; before we got into the Swan Rice came up with Kemlin, we took them all into the Swan public-house, I searched Archer, in his hat I found these two handkerchiefs, in one of the handkerchiefs there were twenty-three penny pieces, in his right hand coat pocket I found twenty-nine pieces, and in his waistcoat pocket I found one penny-piece, and three halfpence. I then asked him where he got these penny pieces, he told me that he had them from his mother to carry to his grandmother at Newington. I told him from the circumstance of his having some in his hat I told him I did not believe him. I desired him to sit down. In about a quarter of an hour the turnpike man Rogers came in; he said the window of the toll-house was shoved open, and four shillings in penny pieces were taken out.</p>

            . I am an officer. On this evening I was in company with my brother officer I first observed Kemlin about four or five yards from the turnpike and I saw the two prisoners walking together on the road, from the toll-house, and Kemlin was on the path, they walked twenty or thirty yards, and then they joined, and they all conversed together about ten or a dozen yards; Armstrong stopped them, the moment he stopped the prisoner, Kemlin ran away, I ran after him about forty or fifty yards, and overtook him; I asked him what made him run away, he said he had been fighting with somebody in the road, and he was afraid it was the same party that came after him. I searched Kemlin, I found twopence halfpenny upon him in halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Rogers. All that you lost was in penny pieces - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Rice. I saw Archer searched, I saw the things found in the manner described by Kennedy. I heard him say that Beazeley had been down in the morning to the toll-house, and asked him if he would be in a good thing, and he went along with them. Beazeley persuaded him to break the toll-house open, but he was afraid to go in at the door; he pushed the window back and got out the penny-pieces; he cried very much, and said he was very sorry, and that he had been over persuaded by Beazeley.</p>

            . I am a brick-maker. I have known both the prisoners at the bar for about five or six years. On the 12th of May I was coming along the fields with my brother, about half past six in the evening, I met Beazeley, he asked me if I would take a walk round the Cat and Mutton field. I left my brother and went with him; we met Archer; Beazeley and Archer asked me if I would take a walk to Shoreditch; I went with them. We walked up Shoreditch and came back again towards Kingsland-road turnpike; Beazeley said, would I go to Kingland. This I suppose was a little after eight o'clock. We went as far as the King's Arms public-house, Kingsland, we had a pot of beer there between us three; then Beazeley and Archer came towards the turnpike. I went over the road. I returned to them. Beazely told Archer to get some money out of the turnpike house; Archer went to the turnpike-house, and got some penny-pieces out; I heard the window go back. He afterwards told me he took them out. Then we came on towards London again, and just as I got up to them, them gentlemen came up and took hold of me; I thought it was somebody else, I ran away.</p>
               <p>Q.Do you recollect whether you made any noise before them gentlemen came up - A. Yes, I whistled, and called Bill; that whistle was answered, I cannot say by whom.</p>
               <p>The prisoners said nothing in their defence; Beazeley called three witnesses, who said they never knew any harm of them.</p>

I only saw at that time five china figures, a hanging book shelf, and two prints, all of which I knew to be my property. I went to Dalston and took an officer with me, and took the prisoner into custody; the officer told him that he had taken him in custody for robbing his master, and that his brother was in custody, and that we had found the articles, in the indictment, upon which he made a full confession of taking the whole; he recapitulated all the articles, and mentioned the different times he had taken them. A chest of drawers he had taken about a twelvemonth ago. I found the chest of drawers at his brother's lodgings, they are my property.</p>

            . I am a potter in these gentlemen's employ. On the 2nd of April I was in the pottery. I saw a load of straw brought to my master's stables by a man of the name of Livermore; the straw was received by Harris and Farrow; I saw Farrow put two parcels of hay into the cart. Harris was looking towards the wheel-wrights shop, apparently as if to look out to observe whether any one saw it. Harris put a bit of straw over the hay.</p>

            . I am a chaff cutter in the employ of the prosecutor. On the 3d of April Livermore brought a load of straw to the stables; Harris and I agreed to let him have a truss of clover hay of Mr. Hope's; I went into the loft, and put a truss of hay down in two parts. Harris looked about the yard to see if any body saw us. Harris then put a truss of straw into the cart to take to Mr. Vigne's stable, for his nag to lye upon; he never sprinkled any over the hay; he chucked it in any how. Harris went up the hill with the cart, and Livermore; I followed a few minutes after. When the cart got from Mr. Vigne's I saw him take the straw out of the cart, and the cart went on. I went into the public house, and Harris came to me; he told me that the man had given him a shilling to spend for the straw, and one shilling and three-pence for the hay, that was two shillings and three-pence all together.</p>
               <p>Q. You were charged and taken up upon this and was admitted an evidence - A. Yes.</p>

On Saturday morning I met her in Ratcliffe Highway. I took her and had her searched. I found nothing upon her, I brought her to the Compter, there the officer searched her. He found a one pound note in the toe of her shoe, and a small broach in her pocket, which I knew to be mine; the officer found the duplicate of a tablecloth, not marked.

            . I am an officer. The prisoner was brought to me at the Compter. I found this one pound note in the toe of her shoe, and this broach in her pocket, and the duplicate of a tablecloth. I said, you made haste in spending the eighteen or twenty pounds; no, she said, there was only one single ten pound note in the drawer, and that she fetched her things out of pawn with it, and this one pound note is what she got in change for the ten pound note.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My husband was serving his Majesty on board a man-of-war. He came home about three months back; I received thirty-one pounds, and my having a child to maintain; I went to service in order to save as much of the money as I could untill my husband came home, and during the time I was in service my mistress employed me to watch the workmen, suspecting that the platsterers robbed the house; and my master I met, he charged me with having robbed him of a ten pound note, and a five pound note; during the time I was in their service I returned a note to my mistress that dropped out of her pocket. I always acted with the strictest honesty and integrity.</p>

               <p>Q. What might be the value of it - A. One hundred and forty-nine pounds is the exact sum it cost me; I sent him to the Castle Inn, supposing that the Macclesfield waggon went from thence, which was not the case. The waggon not going from thence he brought it back again to my house, and laid it down in the passage while he went to the back part of the premises to enquire from whence it did go, which I understand is in Basinghall-street, and before he got back again into the passage the parcel was gone. I saw the parcel again before the Lord Mayor, and swore to it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Will you favour me with the name of your partner - A. I have no partner.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts is this passage - A. There are two entrances into my house, a private one, and the other adjoining the house, both are part of the house, and under the same roof. Before I made the alteration it was the only door by which you could enter.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290010"/>Q. It is not the common entrance to your dwelling-house - A. No, it is not; it is only the entrance to my warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Does any body sleep in that part of the warehouse - A. A man sleeps in the warehouse. You go into the open air from the warehouse before you get to the dwelling-house. The passage leads into the yard.</p>
               <p>COURT. It is the lower part of the house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you have made a separate door, with out going into your dwelling-house - A. Yes. It is in the parish of St. Albans, Wood-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You are the occupier of the whole house - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Did you deliver the parcel yourself to the boy. It is not likely that I did. The parcel was laying to go to such a place. He knew his business. I suppose he took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him bring it back - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that is what you heard from somebody else - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM CAROL. I am fourteen years old next October. On Saturday, April the 6th, at half past six o'clock in the evening, I met the prisoner at the bar with a bag on his shoulder in Aldermanbury postern, Cripplegate; knowing him to be a bad character I stopped him and laid hold of him by the collar; he instantly shoved the bag off his shoulders, as if he would shove it upon me, and rushed out of my hands. I holloaed out stop thief, and pursued him. Two or three people attempted to stop him that broke him from running so fast. I overtook him and brought him to where he had throwed the bag. He was not out of my sight at all. I brought him back to the property, it laid in the road. I left the property and followed him about twenty or thirty yards. I took him and the bag to the sign of the White Horse, Cripplegate-buildings. I marked two letters or the bag, A. H. and left it in the care of Mr. Henshaw, that keeps the White Horse public-house. I took the prisoner to the Compter, and when I came back to take the property away Mr. Henshaw told me somebody had been after it. This is the wrapper, the Alderman desired me to give it up the silk.</p>
               <p>Mr. Reynolds. Did you go straight on or turn the corner when you pursued the prisoner - A. It was in Aldermanbury, all the way along.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course you had no time to observe where the parcel was - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of the parcel - A. Yes, I ran after the man, but when I ran after the man I turned round and saw the parcel.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. to Mr. Maddick. Look at that wrapper - A. I know it to be my wrapper, which contained one hundred and forty-nine pounds weight of silk; these directions were to the wrapper; I cut the wrapper open, and saw it was my silk. The alderman gave me my silk back again, and ordered me to produce the wrapper here.</p>
               <p>The prisoner left his defence to his counsel.</p>

               <p>RICHARD TAYLOR. I am a soldier in the 2nd regiment of Tower Hamlet militia. On the 6th of April; between seven and eight o'clock, I was going to Leadenhall for half a pound of cheese, I was going along Gracechurch-street, I saw the prisoner look at a coat hung out at a door for sale; I saw another with him, I thought he wanted to take it; I walked down Gracechurch-street after him; he went to the shop of Mr. Willatts; he walked by several times, and looked in; when he found an opportunity he snatched down a parasol; I followed him; he ran up a court right fronting Fen Church; I lost sight of him a little while; knowing him by a brown coat that he had got on I went up to him; I said, what have you got here; I saw a bulk under his coat; he made no answer. The other ran away; he wrestled with me a bit; something dropped; I cannot say what it was. I held him and Mr. Willatts saw the parasol.</p>

            , White Conduit-house and the Barley-Mow, Frog Lane.</p>

               <p>Q.Had you respectfully three apartments for you - A. Hudson was a shopkeeper at the time I had lodgings, I believe the prisoner either lodged with his mother or had private lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you occasionally meet at your lodging for the discussion of this plan - A. We were careful not to have any conversation before a fourth person, therefore it was never carried on at any apartments that I had, we used to meet at places were we could have a box to ourselves. It was at last agreed that a forgery should be committed upon the dividend warrant office by filling up four blank dividend printed warrants which was to be brought by the prisoner at the bar and some of the Bank ink on account of its black colour. After the warrants were filled up Hudson was to procure a young man to present them at the proper office in the Bank for payment.</p>
               <p>Q. What sum of money was it proposed to be raised by this means - A. Hudson proposed at least ten thousand pounds, the prisoner objected to the largeness of it, saying that an application for so great a sum would cause the person who applied to be sent to the principal in the office, which principal was most likely acquainted with the names of persons holding large stocks in the three per cents.</p>

               <p>Q. What did he then propose - A. Not a greater amount than two thousand four hundred and thirty pounds should be presented, which sum was filled up.</p>
               <p>Q. That plan was adopted, how did he plan that it should be executed - A. By putting in a fictious name upon a person who had no stock. Then it was proposed to put in a clergymans name because many of them were large stockholders.</p>
               <p>Q. How was this to be carried into execution - A. After this was filled up, a young man was to be procured who was to carry it to the proper office which was done. The young man on being procured was to present this and I was to be behind to see that the money was received.</p>
               <p>Q. How were you to guard against the person who did present it not being detected - A. It was proposed that all sum of that amount would be paid without any objected.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any question before the business was finished how it was to be settled - A. By Hudson reving 500 l. And the remainder between Armitage and myself.</p>
               <p>Q. What were you to do besides being behind the young man to see the money paid - A. To pass the notes and I was to fill up the warrant, Hudson having been in the Bank his hand-writing would be known he thought he should be suspected; I was to fill them up and my principal business was to dispose of the notes afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he in consequence of this agreement bring some dividend warrants and some ink - A. He brought six.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the reason of bringing six when there was only four to be made - A. For fear of miscalculation, the two were to guard against an accident.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you in consequence or that fill up these four papers - A. I did fill up these four, I did an except the bottom signature, that is Hudson's to them all William Birt attorney.</p>
               <p>Q.Before you got to the Bank did the prisoner give you any information respecting that office in which<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290012"/>he was stationed - A. He did, he stated that very day which was the first day of payment.</p>
               <p>Q. What date was this - A. I am not certain it was early in July 1809, he stated to me that very day, the day before it was intended to apply for the money, that very day a young man had been appointed to the dividend office to pay the warrants, and that he sat at his left and he had to superintend him, that it would be proper that the application should be made to this young man for the payment of them, because of he having the superintendance to guard against a discovery. He said he had on that day early in the morning received two thousand pounds which he had no occasion for them that day.</p>
               <p>Q. This was in the afternoon of the day after the hours of the Bank that you had this conversation with him - A. It was, that he had early in the morning received two thousand pound notes, that he had no occasison for them that day, that he would very likely the next day have the two same or two others of the same amount.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hudson procure a young man - A. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What character did Hudson assume for the purpose of hiring the young man - A. The name of Birt, stockbroker.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that of your own knowledge - A. I know that he had the clerk, I do not know what name he went by.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you after this conversation go to the Bank at the same time the young man went to receive the money with the warrants - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave the warrants to the young man - A. Hudson.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you know that - A. Yes I do, I saw him give them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. With what directions did the young man go to the Bank - A. He was taken into the office by Hudson; his master carried him into the office with the papers in the common way of stockbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the warrant office - A. Into the pay office.</p>
               <p>Q. The young man knew nothing from you of this transaction did he - A. Nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the directions that were given him, and see him follow these directions - A. I did, he went to this young man of the left of Armitage the new Bank clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. The brokers clerk went to the new clerk in the Bank, you saw him on the left of Armitage - A. Yes and placed myself immediately behind this clerk.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it early in the morning - A. About half past eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Armitage been apprised that it was to be done that morning - A. It was settled to be done that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between Armitage and you - A. I moved my hat for Armitage to know me, he knew my business, and that it was settled I should be there the preceeding evening. After waiting some time as the office was thronged the young man put the warrants down before Mr. Mills, the clerk Mills took them up, and asked him how he would have them, meaning in what notes; he had been desired to say the shortest way for I am agoing to take them to our bankers directly. The clerk looked over his money; Armitage was close to his elbow, and the clerk Mills said to Armitage, have you got two one thousand pound notes; He said he had, and produced them, they were given by Armitage to the clerk Mills, and Mr. Mills took the number of the notes, these two one thousand and four one hundred pounds; he then gave to Hudson's young man a twenty and a ten, making together two thousand four hundred and thirty pounds. The young man had been desired by Hudson to come to him at the Bank coffee-house, and if he was not there to wait for him because was there any discovery made I was to have apprized him. He waited for me under the Royal Exchange.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw it all done, you went and informed him that it was all right, and then you went with him to the coffee-house - A. Yes, but I staid out side of the coffee-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw him go in the coffee-house, how soon did he join you - A. In less than five minutes, he gave me the two one thousand pound notes and told me to go to the Bank directly and change them. I by direction wrote Hammersly upon one of the notes; it was mutually agreed by us before to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that note is that the one - A. Yes, the word Hammersley is my own hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. Then did you get your two thousand pound notes broke into smaller sums - A. Into one hundred and fifty tens, and one hundred fives, and while I was waiting in the cashiers office for change, Armitage came out of his own office into the cashers office and saw that I received the change, that there was no doubt there, he did nothing more than look on; I got my change and went away and met Hudson; Armitage went back to his office.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after that did you meet Armitage - A. About four five or six in the afternoon of the same day he came to my lodgings in Princes Square, Kennington.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you had them lodgings at that time - A. Not much more than a week or nine days.</p>
               <p>Q. By whose advice had you changed your lodgings - A. By the advice of Hudson and Armitage.</p>
               <p>Q. What reason did Armitage or Hudson assign to you for your changing your lodging - A. Because that was a part of the town I never resided in, and of course was not known.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to your lodgings that afternoon, what then - A We rode out together in a chaise me and Armitage we went down the Croydon Road, drank a bottle of wine and returned home to my lodgings. I gave Armitage fifty notes of ten pounds each, and fifty of five pound each and many others of one's two's but the exact amount I could not tell on that night; and the night after made up the amount of a thousand pounds what I gave him, these were the notes that I received at the cashiers office and I had changed some to get smaller notes.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you employ any body else to exchange any for you - A. Not the first day, On the Monday early in the morning, Kezia Willis went out with me to break the larger notes; we went to many of the shops at the west-end of the Town, as many as we<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290013"/>could; we got rid of as much as we could in the course of that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you had your own share - A. Yes, and I paid Hudson his share, excepting thirty-five pounds; I paid him four hundred and sixty-five pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any alteration made to the notes - A. Where an ought could be made into a six or a nine, it was done, and a one into a seven or a four, it was done, but no additional figures.</p>
               <p>Q.Well, sir, this business being so settled as you made alterations was there any application of the ink - A. We made use of the bank ink.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that one of the notes that you so altered - A. It appears like our alterations.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this before you were apprehended - A. About thirteen months.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you intercourse in the mean time of seeing Armitage and Hudson - A. Yes, constantly in the habit of seeing them. I was taken up about the 4th or 5th of August, 1810.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Kezia Willis taken into custody too - A. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of Folkard - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with him - A. Not many months.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a common acquaintance between you and the prisoner - A. He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, before you were taken in custody know that the prisoner was acquainted with Folkard - A. We have been in company together upon excursions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Do you mean parties of pleasure - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. And Folkard knew Willis too - A. Yes, we were often in the habit of riding out together.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he soon informed that you were in custody - A. Very soon; he visited me; not he himself, but a friend of his, sent by him, came to see me the first week of my confinement.</p>
               <p>Q. Look in that dividend warrant you hold in your hand, there is a hole in the middle of it - A. There is; it was not there when presented; one name I recollect, that is, Hoffman. I see now the letters, Hoff.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was any clerk in the bank of the name of Hoffman - A. Indirectly I did, that made me recollect the name.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt of the name of the person who signed for the bank, his name was Hoffman - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any warrants of the bank to fill them up by - A. Yes, two bona fide warrants; he said he had paid for them himself, and therefore had brought them to me for patterns. They were for the purpose of copying the clerks names, whose signature they had, and the manner of filling up.</p>
               <p>Q. You, as near as you could, imitated the writing of the clerks - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Hoffman is one of these names - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. And therefore you made it as much like Hoffman's signature as you could - A. Yes, and G. Taylor, I made that like G. Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the two warrants which he brought you as patterns - A. They were returned to him.</p>

               <p>Q. Does this tend to criminate yourself - A. It does.</p>
               <p>Q. You have undergone many adventures not connected with this business, have not you been apprehended upon many other charges than this - A. I have, twice in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. But any where else - A. Then I object; I decline answering the question whether I dealt in annuities; because I might criminate myself; it might lead on to other questions.</p>
               <p>COURT. Were you concerned in annuities - A. I have been.</p>
               <p>Mr. Serjeant Ruff. Have you been concerned in annuities - A. I have, only one transaction of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Only one single transaction - A. Only one.</p>

               <p>COURT. Do you apprehend that your going by any title of honour do you think your answering that question it would tend to criminate yourself - A. I think it will.</p>

               <p>Mr. Serjeant Ruff. Did you ever call yourself, or go by the name of Lord Percy - A. I shall not answer it without my lord commands me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you have told me when the period of your first apprehension was, when was the second apprehension - A. About the year 1803.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what charge were you apprehended then Mr. Roberts - A. I negotiated a bill which a gentleman had stolen from his purse, or had lost it.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the charge made against you to cause that apprehension - A. It was merely the payment of the bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were you first acquainted with, Hudson or the prisoner Armitage - A. I was acquainted with Hudson first. Hudson was a clerk in the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is it since you saw Hudson - A. I suppose it is five months.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the charge made against you, which occasioned you to be in the House of Correction, Cold Bath Fields - A. I never saw a copy of my commitment.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have no notion - A. I have a notion, I was examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a forgery - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. More than one - A. It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a distinct charge made against you for a forgery, and was not a charge made against<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290015"/>you for stealing - A. There was a charge against me for things that were found upon my person, they were exchequer bills.</p>
               <p>Q. And the charge was, that these exchequer bills which were found in your pocket were stolen - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course that was a distinct charge from the other charge - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you charged with having stolen any other things besides these exchequer securities - A. I cannot answer the question. There was another charge made against me, but I believe abandoned; it was entered into, but not continued.</p>
               <p>Q. What other things were found upon you besides exchequer bills - A. Two bank post-bills.</p>
               <p>Q. They were also made a subject of charge - A. They were entered into. I was not detained upon any of these things.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, sir, it was not untill you made your escape from the House of Correction, Cold Bath Fields, that you told the story that you have today - A. It was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Is that writing extant now - A. I cannot tell, I never kept a copy; it was sent to the Governor of the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. You had taken no step to disclose this previous to your being taken - A. None, whatever.</p>
               <p>Q. And then for the first time you told the story that you have told to-day - A. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your reason for doing that - A. An innate love of justice, and a desire to make as much reparation as possible.</p>
               <p>Q. That is what you mean now to state as one great motive for your discovery, upon your oath was it that - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a person of the name of 
               <persName id="t18110529-18-person191">Clarke</persName>

             that Mr. Armitage was as innocent as a child unborn, and that you did it all yourself - A. That is quite impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you state to Clarke that Hudson and you alone did this, and that Armitage was totally innocent - A. That never took place; I will swear it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if you did not say this to Clarke then you did not say any thing about being hanged yourself, did you - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know such a person as Clarke - A. I do; and I swear that I never uttered such words to Clarke, nor to any person whatever.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Who is this man of the name of Clarke - A. I know a man of the name of Clarke, a butcher at Newington; he was in the habit of coming into Newgate very often.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether he was an acquaintance of the prisoner - A. I believe they were acquainted; Clarke kept a public house where Armitage was in the habit of going as well as me, but not lately. It is four years back since he had a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you at the time that you wrote the narrative that you sent to the Governor of the bank - A. In Newgate.</p>

               <p>Q. What is the number of the note that you issued of twenty pounds value - A.2005, it is altered to 2695, the alteration is visible.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the number of the ten pound note - A.3613, it is altered into 3643, that alteration is visible, I have not the least doubt that is the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the warrant, you see there is a hole in it, was it in that state when you paid it - A. Certainly not, it has been punched out, I am certain the warrant appeared whole and perfect when paid, they were canceled in this manner at the time, we have altered our mode since.</p>

               <p>Q. While he has been in one prison, and you in another you have been allowed to go and see him - A. Once a week, and sometimes more, since I have been with Mr. Adkins in the House of Correction, which is ten weeks.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted you thought you were in a serious situation - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you thought it better that any body else should be hanged than you - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And you hope to save yourself from all punishment by giving the evidence that you now give - A. I told the truth, it is so.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. How soon after you were in custody did you make your solicitation to the solicitor of the bank - A. In about eight or nine days after I was first apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he in his own office in the bank - A. In the dividend warrant office; I went early, he was at his desk.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you communicate to Mr. Armitage - A. I told him that Mrs. Roberts intended to involve him and his brother in the forgery. I always understood she was Roberts's wife.

               <p>Q. Try - what do you think you said - A. I said it was an unfortunate circumstance, what steps did he mean to take; he talked of surrendering himself, and his friend as well as myself advised him not in the present state of the business.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect making any observations to him upon his telling you this - A. I told him it was a strange thing, it was throwing himself upon my mercy, He said he had no friend that he could confide in, and therefore he had sent for me to consult with him what was the best steps to take.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you any other friendship with him than in the company of Roberts - A. None, whatever; he said he should come to town that evening. He did not say afterwards exactly what steps he should take.</p>

               <p>Q. You kept this, you did not deliver this to Roberts - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe about this time that this paper was delivered to you he had broke out of prison - A. Yes, and on that day I received this paper from Armitage Roberts was re-apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoner afterwards until he was apprehended in the country - A. I never saw him until this morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Because he thought you were an honest man, and a friend, he thought he would trust you upon a common, and he told you all you have related - You had a communication with the girl in prison - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. I dare say that you, as an honest man, to whom another in distress would look, you went immediately and gave information to the bank - You went to the solicitor of the bank and communicated what you understood - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not the duty of an honest man so to have done - A. It might; I did not communicate it to the Solicitor of the Bank, nor to any body else.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was that - A. I cannot answer you. It is six or seven months ago; that pleasure was blendid with business at the same time.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do not you like to answer the question - A. Because it might tend to criminate myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body desire you to give that answer - A. No; I do not chuse to answer, because it might tend to convict myself, or to involve me in some difficulty.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told me that it is about seven months ago that you went with this party of pleasure blendid with business, I now ask you again where that was - A. I do not chuse to tell you.</p>
               <p>Q. I insist upon an answer, and appeal to his lordship - A. We went to Birmingham.</p>

               <p>Q. You say you went to Birmingham - A. We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you whether he and you went on the same business - A. I do not know what business he went on, I know my own.</p>

Yes, On the 13th of August I was employed to print hand-bills by the Solicitor of the bank; on that night I sent off bills to Harwich, Dover, Bristol, Holyhead, and Yarmouth, by the Mail, and to other places; and the hand-bills were ordered to be posted in every one of these places. This is the fifty guineas one, after that it was encreased to the sum of one hundred guineas, and then to three hundred guineas. I then sent two hundred to them by every mail-coach in England. This is the three hundred guineas bill.</p>
               <p>(The dividend warrant read.)</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My lord, and gentlemen of the jury - I am totally innocent of the charge for which I am accused. The characters of the persons that are brought against me are such that nobody could believe; they are of that description of people that would do an injury to any one by way of saving themselves. My reason of going away I can explain; Mr. Folkard came to me and said that Roberts meaned to hang me and my brother John; he said, if you stay your place will be forfeited; I went away, believing that if I was accused by such a man my situation would be forfeited, therefore I waited for the advice of a friend, who persuaded me, as I was away, to keep away, until I heard the charge. With regard to my accompts I left them correct; I had notes to a large amount, I had frequently larger amounts in my care than all the clerks in the office; I had thirty thousand pounds in my care, as my books will prove. I have been in the bank seven or eight years, and never the smallest imputation against me in the world. I wish to state with regard to my lending Mr. 
               <persName id="t18110529-18-person220">Mills</persName>
             the two thousand pound notes, that is as common an occurence as any in the office, it is done two or three times a day. The person that gives out the notes comes round the office and says, those who have got large notes lend to the other clerks who may want them. And with regard to Roberts's saying I had a thousand pounds of him, had it been so it is very odd that no notes have been traced to me. When my house was searched no notes were found, nor when I was taken and searched was any notes found upon me. Roberts has been connected with Hudson and Cook, both have been clerks in the bank. They both being bad men knew every thing of the bank business; and with respect to the warrants and receipts they might have been got by any clerk in the bank; and with regard to the letter to Roberts I can account for that, I certainly owed him seventeen pounds, which is the money mentioned there; and I mentioned there of what his wife said of me; I wished to know what his wife had accused me off; and with regard to this Folkard and Roberts their words cannot be taken.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he so in August last - A. He was; he was in the one and two pound note office.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he employed in the dividend office under any department, and under what letter - A. He was called in to assist in our office, that is, the Imperial office, in July, 1810, about the 9th or 10th, the first day of the payment of dividends.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he remain there until the month of August - A. Until this was discovered he did; he did remain till August.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the letter under which he paid - A. No particular letter; he had the whole of the books of the Imperial Annuity, there being but a small number of dividend warrants in that stock to be paid.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the charge over the books for the purpose of paying - A. He had access to the books, and to the dividend warrants.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the prisoners duty to pay dividend warrants - A. It was, and in the letter F among all the rest.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the care of the drawer containing the warrants - A. Not particularly; he had access to the drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you got the dividend book - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Turn to the dividend book, and look at the signature of A. Fraser, from 1806, to May 1810 inclusive - A. Here they all are.</p>
               <p>Q. Now looking at the different enteries of A. Fraser tell me whose hand-writing you believe it to be - A. I believe it to be the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that in all - A. I mean that in all.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said before that you had seen the prisoner write often - A. Yes, often; he came to our office to assist us.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you were in the same office with him - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Take these dividend warrants in your hand, and looking at the signature. A. Fraser, tell me whose hand-writing you believe it to be - A. I believe them to be the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. You see a signature of G. Thomas to these receipts - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q.Whose hand-writing do you believe them to be - A. The prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe it is the practice of the bank to have the books locked up - A. Yes, very often.</p>
               <p>Q. And are the dividend warrants also locked up after the business of the day - A. They are.</p>
               <p>Q. So they remain locked up and secured till the next day - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You are permanently stationed in the Imperial office - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You are one of the stated clerks of that office - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. You are one of the established clerks of that office - A. I am,</p>
               <p>Q. And the prisoner was, as it were, lent to your office, during the increase of business for a time - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in your office - A. Six or seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. During these times how many clerks were there in the office during the whole time - A. Six in the whole.</p>
               <p>Q. Each of them I take it for granted, had access to the books, and to the drawer for delivering warrants - A. Certainly.</p>
               <p>Q. When was your attention first called to these warrants - A. In January last.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said, Mr. Marston, the signature of A. Fraser, is the prisoner's hand-writing; I beg leave to ask you whether you made up that belief from the inspection of the writing, or from something that you have heard from other persons, or both together - A. I have made up my opinion from the whole examination of the warrants, and of the books and bank notes, and an odd letter or two that I have seen; from a comparison of all these things I have made up my mind.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing, before you had heard of this business, I had come to you and presented to you that; supposing you had not heard anything on the subject, could you have said that A. Fraser is Mr. Thomas's hand-writing - A. I dare say not.</p>
               <p>Q. These warrants were shewn to you in January last - A. I saw some one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon their being suspected that there was a forgery committed - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner was then, in January, a clerk in the bank - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. And he continued so until April - A. He continued so until he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not in last month that he was apprehended - A. Thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore he continued a clerk in the bank for four months after this was shewn to you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Take this into your hand, attend to what I say to you. I put into your hand the dividend warrant, looking at the signature of this, and refering to nothing but your memory of the prisoner's handwriting, referring to that, and that alone, do you believe it to be his figures, disregarding all the circumstances which combining lead to an opinion, does the characters alone impress a belief that it is Mr. Thomas's hand-writing - A. My belief is that it is his hand-writing, and that belief is founded on these two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290024"/>things - the general character of his hand-writing, and on the resemblance of one letter to other letters; comparing one letter with another I believe it is his handwriting.</p>
               <p>Q. If I was to cut off the signature A. Fraser, and give you this piece of paper, does your memory of his characters enable you to say it is his hand-writing - A. I can speak to one letter in particular, the letter F in Fraser, and the letter T in Thomas, his own name.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the capital F in Fraser, and the capital T in Thomas bears such a resemblance that you believe it is his - A. I do.</p>

               <p>Q. I take it for granted that the most thing that you saw him write was his own signature - A. I have seen him write his own name more than any thing else.</p>
               <p>Q. His duty principally in your office was to witness the proprietor's stock in the dividend warrants with his own name - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore the characters, C. Thomas, were the characters that you were most used to - A.Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore looking at C. Thomas, it strikes you so that you believe it to be his writing - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Now look in the dividend book, and look in August 1810, now considering nothing but that which is under you eye; A. Fraser, whose writing do you believe that to be - A. I believe it to be the prisoner's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe so from your former acquaintance with his characters of writing - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And from the impression that the character's have made upon your mind - A. Exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. And you have the same impression upon all the others that you have looked at - A. Exactly.</p>

               <p>Q. Looking at that, and it being your course of writing the name of the person of whom you received it, can you say from whom you received it - A. I can say that I received it of some person belonging to Mr. Rogers's family; I put such memorandums on the notes for my own security; I can say no further than that I received that note of some person in Mr. Rogers's family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Have you any person to assist in your shop - A. Only my wife.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow. Now, my lord, I give you the numbers of some of the notes; I will take the first three notes that were paid to Rogers - No. 6092, 6094, 6095, dated 23d of July, 1810; these are bank notes of two pound each, issued by Mr. Tatam, that came to Mr. Rogers.

             to change is one of those that Mr. Tatam paid in satisfaction of the forged receipt, the number of that bank is 5475, that is one of the eight ten pounds, dated 23d of July, 1810; I now produce twenty bank notes of five pound each, dated 25th of July, 1810, which will be found to be part of that sum that Mr. Tatam issued in part of that payment; upon which there is writing to as to prove that they passed through the prisoner's hands, 6994, I will give you this number first, a five pound note, dated 25th of July, 1810.</p>

               <p>Q. to Mr. Rogers. Look at that, is there any writing were you believe to be the writing of the prisoner's - A. Yes, there is the name of Mrs. Edwards.</p>
               <p>Q. The next 6995, look and see whether there is any writing of the prisoner's upon that - A. There is an initial, I; I believe that to be the prisoner's hand writing.</p>
               <p>Q. No 6995 - A. That is the same, and 6994, that is the same; another letter I; they have all the same I in the same place in the note, in the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290026"/>face of the note towards the right-hand corner, at the top.</p>
               <p>COURT. If some of these will not do nothing will turn upon the number.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They are twenty of the twenty-four, between 6977 and 7000. Now I out into the hand of the witness a ten pound bank note, No. 5474, dated 23d of July, 1810; Mr. Rogers look at the back of it, and see whether George Symes, and the address is the hand-writing of any person you know - A. Yes, it is the prisoner's.</p>

               <p>Q. Now there is another ten pound with the initial I, No. 5500, 23d of July, 1810 - A. That is the same as the former, with the letter I, of the prisoner's hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Marston. Look at the word, I Solomon, and say whose writing you believe it to be - A. I cannot speak to it.</p>
               <p>Q. I will just shew you the three notes that were paid to Rogers, whose do you believe that writing to be - A. I am positive to one of them; the word Bishopsgate, is the prisoner's hand-writing, and I believe the others very much resembles the prisoner's writing; I believe they are the prisoner's writing, they are the three that were issued to Mr. Rogers.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. You found your belief principally by comparison, do you not - A. I do.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. With respect to the word Bishopsgate-street, is that stated with comparison - A. It is stated with comparison with the transfer book; that and other books I have compared.</p>

            . I was house-surgeon at Westminster Infirmary. On Sunday the 26th of August Martha Birt was brought to the Westminster Hospital as a casualty; I saw her on the Monday morning, she had received a wound on the upper lip, which had divided it, and which had been dressed on the day proceding by a surgeon in attendance. The upper jaw was not injured in the least; I perceived no other injury. I was informed that she was in a state of intoxication when brought to the hospital; there did not appear any injury but the one on her lip. She was admitted an out-patient, and came to the hospital as directed for six or seven days; an inflammation having attacked the place, spreading towards the head, it was judged proper to make her an in-patient.</p>
               <p>Q. The inflammation attacked what place - A.About the lip, and it did spread generally over the face, and head, and then from certain symptoms it was considered to extend to the brain; she had a violent pain in her head, with blood-shot eyes, it was considered of having attacked the brain; six or seven days previous to her death she became delirious, in which state she continued attended with a sympathetic fever until the 26th of September, and that day she died. The lips of the wound, when first brought to the hospital were put in amputation, and retained there with a silver pin and ligature; the lip was nearly healed on the fourth day subsequent to the receipt of the injury; it was about this time the inflammation, which was of the erysipelas kind, appeared, though it was too slight to occasion a disunion of the edges of the wound; however, it extended gradually all over the face and head, and finally it appeared to have attacked the membranes of the brain, which, with the accompanying sympathetic sever terminated her existence. Early on the morning, the day after her death, I opened her head, I found the membranes covering the brain, much inflamed evidently with the vessels loaded with blood, a serum and lymph coagulated upon the membranes, and between them. No injury had been received at any part of the body. The liver was much diseased, which I imputed to her intemperance of drinking spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, having told us this poor woman's complaints, what in your opinion was the cause of her death - A. I have no doubt her death is to be ascribed to the inflammation of the brain.</p>
               <p>Q. And by what, in your judgment was that inflammation caused - A. I think from the wound. I think she inflammation was caused from the local injury, because it first shewed itself in that part. But I should wish to observe that inflammation was very likely to come on in a constitution like hers, without any wound - in a constitution injured by drinking spirits.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any means of knowing whether she was conformable to your rules and directions - A. I believe she had not; when she came she always had the appearance of having drank spirits, and in examining the lip I perceived her breath smell of gin.</p>
               <p>Q. Under these circumstances are you able to say whether that inflammation was brought on by the wound or by her intemperance - A. I conceived the wound of such a trivial nature that I should not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290028"/>hesitate much of having one in my own lip. Where there is a local injury, however slight, the inflammation will seize that part first. I do not say so in a good constitution, but in a bad one, injured by drinking and unwholesome food, and in an unhealthy atmosphere; it was not a wound the least in the world, in my opinion, to occasion death. It has been said that the wound was inflicted by a hammer, I much doubt it.</p>

             I was surgeon that week. I remember the case perfectly well, I remember seeing her, she appeared to me to be a person addicted to drinking spirituous liquors to excess, of consequence she seemed to have an unfound and bad liver, especially liable to a disease called Erysipelas, that is, St. Anthony's Fire, which is considered as a constitutional disorder, spreading itself without limits, unlike other inflammations which stop at certain periods. When I saw 
               <persName id="t18110529-25-person277">
                  Martha

                  </persName>
             about the second day after the reception into the hospital, I saw symptoms of that disorder all over her head and face, the marks of St. Anthony's Fire distinctly so, there being a continuity of the membranes of the head on the outside of the head with those inside. We always expect Erysipelas of the head, it spread in this manner; - the wound that was received upon the lip was not upon a vital part, even the thin bone of the upper jaw was not shattered, which is thin and cancellated; I considered the wound by no means a mortal wound, but that the subsequent disease was a dangerous disease, to wit, the Erysipelas. I directed the body to be examined but was not present.</p>
               <p>Q I will now ask you, sir, whether, from the account you have heard Mr Downing give, you think the injury she received was the cause of her death - A. Any less injury, bleeding, or the pricking of a pin I think simply; the wound on the lip produced the Erysipelas, or it might have arisen spontaneous, but as we traced it from the wound we ascribe that as the cause of it; I consider that was the producing cause.</p>
               <p>Mr. Downing. I think there must be a mistake about the hammer producing the injury of the lip, if I had cut it with a knife it could not have been more smooth; I saw it within forty-eight hours after the receipt of the injury. If it had been cut by the edge of a hammer it must have injured the gum or teeth; a slight blow will knock the front teeth out; I saw no injury of the gum. I never heard her complain of ill-treatment from any person whatever. She complained of a fall.</p>

            . I am a watchman. At ten o'clock I heard a person call watch, I went to him. As I was going up the court I saw two girls running, the prisoner said, run Jane, run. The prosecutor gave me charge of the prisoner, he said she had picked his pocket of a watch, and gave it to another, who had run away. I took her to the watchhouse.</p>
               <p>Mr. Challenor. Did the prosecutor appear to you to be sober - A. He appeared to have been drinking. He appeared to be sensible.</p>

               <persName id="t18110529-26-person281">Jane</persName>
             I met the prosecutor, he took Jane and me to a house in Southampton-buildings, after that he took us three times into the wine vaults facing Gray's Inn-lane, and when he came out he was hugging and kissing Jane; she and another ran from him; he said he had lost his watch; he detained me until I told him where they lived, I could not. I was searched, nothing was found on me. He was very much intoxicated in liquor.</p>

As soon as I had finished these words, I felt something come round me on my right hand side and I felt my watch go out of my pocket. I put my hand down and found it was gone. I looked round, and saw the prisoner close by my side. I went to catch hold of him, he made a small circle from my reach, ran up Sweet Apple Court, and went through a passage into Dunning's Alley, that is the only time I lost sight of him. He went across that alley as if to go through another passage, he then turned a little to the left and was taken by the watchman. I am sure he is the same man, I was close to him all the while.

He said it was on a dunghill in Dunnings Alley. I took him and led him to Dunnings Alley and searched about there a long time, we could find nothing there; he said he was sure it must be there, because he heard the girls throw it away, and then I took him to the Compter.</p>

            . It was near upon one o'clock that I went out of my place to get a pint of beer for dinner. I live in Long-alley; our back door, which lodgers go in at, is in Hand-alley. When I came back with the beer, the door was pushed to, the door is never pushed to, because it is very dark; I pushed it open, and a genteel woman came from behind the door. I did not observe her at the time having any child by her; I passed her, I got up three stairs, I heard her say come Billy, she took this child up in her arms, I turned round, I saw the frock was intirely untied behind, and one of the childs arms intirely bare; she turned round to me with this child in her arms, she said I beg your pardon Ma'am, let me tie this child's frock, the child has piddled itself, seeing her a genteel woman I went up stairs, and said nothing. It was a coloured frock.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, is that the woman. - A. As soon as my husband had gone from dinner I went down stairs, the neighbours said do you know this child, it is drove out of your passage. I said I saw this child in a genteel woman's arms, she said she was going to turn the frock; aye, said they, she has turned it quite off. I am positive the prisoner is the woman, and I am positive of the child.</p>

               <p>Q.(to prosecutrix) Is that your child. - A. Yes, and this is my frock, here is a piece of it, I am sure it is my frock that the child had on that day.</p>

               <p>Q. On the 23d of April last how many watches had you in the house. - A. I had three, but she only took two.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the house were these watches in. - A. The silver watch with the gold chain and gold seals were hanging up against the window frame where I work, the other watch I do not know where it hung that afternoon, it commonly hanged against a screw by the fire-place in our bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a watch was that. - A. It was a silver watch with a brass cap, it had a scarlet ribbon and a gold seal.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you last see these watches. - A. On Tuesday the 23d of April, I last see my watch in the room where I work, I had been to work there about an hour and a half before I missed it. I cannot say particularly when I see the watch in my bed-room.</p>
               <p>Q. You rent the whole house. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MRS. GOOZEE. Q. You are the wife of the last witness. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing these watches on the 23d of April. - A. I hung my watch with the scarlet ribbon and one seal by the fire-place, it was a watch that I generally wore, it hung up there in the morning, I went out about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before that had you seen it. - A. The moment before I went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see your husband's watch in his room, did you. - A. No, that was two pair of stairs higher than mine.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss the watch. - A. As soon as I returned, near eight o'clock at night. The prisoner slept in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you. - A. Not above three weeks I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you receive any character with her. - A. My father was overseer of the parish, and most of the commissioners knew her, my husband knew her from a baby. I took her by the recommendation of the commissioners, most of them knew her. She applied for relief. I went immediately and searched after my watch to a great many pawnbrokers, at Mr. Matthew's in the Minories I found the watch with the gold chain and seals. I went to Mr. Hill and Sowerby's, Rosemary Lane, and there I found the watch with the scarlet ribbon and seals. He produced two gowns, I knew them immediately. I found these two gowns missing, and also a gown that I had on before I went out. I missed a guinea that was in my drawer in my bed-room, and the gowns were in another drawer. I missed seven pence in halfpence, a cap trimmed with a broad lace, a tablecloth, and nine napkins. The pawnbrokers have them here.</p>

            . Q.Do you know where Mrs. Pasley lives. - A. Yes, her house is in St. Martins-court. On Thursday night, April the 25th, about half-past eight, or between that and nine, I observed two men standing near about the middle of Mrs. Pasleys window, outside in the court. I observed that Mangham had his right hand, with the flap of his coat up to cover the glass, and his left hand was in the hole in the glass case, the show-glass which comes outside of the window.</p>
               <p>Q. Does this show-glass stand in the shop. - A. No, it is outside of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you get at what is within that shew-glass, unless you break the show-glass, without going into the shop. - A. No, the shew-glass draws into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. But you could not get at that without breaking the show-glass or going into the shop. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there were two men standing there. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know them again. - A. Yes, both of them. I went by the shop door. Taylor was one of the persons that was standing close to the shop window, nearest to me, and Mangham was the other, he looked very hard at me.</p>
               <p>Q. You say there was another person with Taylor, was that Mangham. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the person that was with Taylor was Mangham. - A. When I was looking at Taylor, I was astonished at them, I cried out; Mangham turned round, and looked very hard at me: I am sure one of the persons I saw at the window was Mangham, there was a lamp just above his face that shewed a very great light, it hung over the shew-glass, and, by the help of that light, I saw his face perfectly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lay hold of either of the persons. - A. I intended as Mangham was the last of them to seize him, he made off,

               <p>Mr. Ryenolds. Q. Be so kind as to tell me what you are. - A. I am an apprentice to Mr. Bicknell, a printer.</p>
               <p>Q.Will you condescend to tell me what brought you through this passage that night. - A. Certainly, Sir; I was going home, I intended to call at my brother's in Marshall street. I was coming past, it was in the middle of the court, the narrow part of the court goes into the square.</p>
               <p>Q. How long were you there observing these men. - A. About a minute, before I seized Taylor.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the whole observation you made before Taylor went off was about a minute. - A. Taylor did not go off, it was Mangham.</p>

               <p>Q. What day was the 17th of May, - A. A Friday, I had occasion to go out that evening about half past eight my husband went with me, I left the prisoner in the house and five young women some of them are my apprentices, before I went out I went down stairs and gave her directions. The things that I missed were up stairs all but the tea spoons those were below.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the silver tea spoons down below. - A. I had not seen them after tea time.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return that evening. - A. About a quarter before eleven.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you supped. - A. No, I rang the bell for the prisoner to bring the supper up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen the prisoner before you went out. - A. Yes, I spoke to her the last thing. There is a second door that opens to the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. There is first an outer door than there is an inner door that leads into the passage. - A. Yes, I went in at the outer door to the inner door, I am not quite certain whether the outer door was shut or not, the inner door leads to the kitchen stairs and to the other stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. The inner door to the passage is parallel to the street door. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you say you think one or the other of these doors were shut. - A. Yes, I believe it was the outer door, and the inner door shuts with a latch.</p>
               <p>Q. The outer door I suppose has a spring lock, - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you rung your bell for the prisoner to bring the supper. - A. Yes, she did not come, I then went and called her, she did not answer, I then asked the young people in the work room if they knew where she was, they told me they knew nothing of her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the work room up stairs. - A. No, on the ground floor within the second door, I sent one of my young people to see if she was up stairs, I found she was gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Then your suspicion was raised and you looked about to see what you had lost, what did you lose. - A. I went into the kitchen first, I lost five silver tea spoons, her own clothes were taken out of the box and the box left, I then went up stairs into my own bed room, I missed two clothes bags full of dirty linnen, the bags contained shirts, gowns, petticoats, shifts, stockings, neck and pocket handkerchiefs and night caps, and various other things, the bags were gone as well as the articles, I missed several necklaces, ear rings and finger rings, beads and bracelets and a variety of little articles; these were in a little drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose generally during the hours of the day you keep the outer door open so as to admit your customers, you only keep the inner door shut. - A. Yes, we generally keep the outer door open untill the close of the day and then shut it.</p>
               <p>Q. At half past eight when you went out was it dark. - A. It was scarcely dark but very near.</p>
               <p>Q. You have spoken to a great number of articles do you think a young woman like her is able to carry off that quantity. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the prisoner had any person to follow her. - A. She had not while with me, she had been only four days in the house. I had a very good character with her.</p>
               <p>Q. After discovering this loss when did you first hear of these things again. - A. On the following morning about eleven o'clock an officer from Bow-street came to me, his name is Salmon, he asked me if I had lost a servant and any property, I told him I had, he told me that he had her and the property in custody. An officer afterwards came from Marlborough-street and said she was taken there. I went to Marlborough-street and saw the prisoner and saw the articles and swore to them. I saw all that I lost as far as I know, they were in a bag, except the trinkets which were tied up in an apron or a handkerchief.</p>

I never saw her before that night, the prisoner now at the bar is the person, when she first came to my house I was two doors off, she had not been in my house above two or three minutes when the maid came to me and asked me if I would take a pair of stockings in for a bed for the prisoner, in consequence of that I went home and saw the prisoner there sitting down just inside of the door, she had three bundles with her, I asked her where she came from, she said she came from Hertfordshire, she had travelled up that day from Uxbridge and that she was very tired, I asked her if she had any friends in London, she said, no. I asked her what brought her to London, she said to look for a service; then my servant said to the prisoner I think I know you young woman, she said no; yes my servant replied about twelve or fourteen months ago you took a pair of stockings away from my master, Mr. Dillon, that I had to pay for, the prisoner denied it, then I said if you have been a thief I must see what you have got in these bundles. I then opened this bundle, she said they were her own. I turned out of a dark cotton clothes bag the contents, a great many dresses, shifts, shirts, and handkerchiefs, a great deal of dirty linen, and some clean white stockings and a little work bag besides; she said that her mother was dead, that they were left her and they were her own, I opened an apron where there were a great many rings and little boxes with trinkets, then I told her she was some servant, and that she had robbed the lady's dressing room. I went out for a watch-man and he took her St. Giles's watch-house, and I went to the watch-house with her. The watchman took the things with him his name is Timothy Lane.</p>

            . I am constable and watch-house keeper of St. Giles's, I attended at the examination at Marlborough-street, this bundle that I have in my hand was sealed up by the magistrate, I was present when the prisoner was brought into the watch-house, an inventory was made out and the things were delivered to Mrs. Cummings, these things have been in my custody ever since the second examination, Mrs. Cummings had them on the Saturday, there was a seal put on every individual thing; and they are so now. Mrs. Cummings insisted upon me having them and I did not want any dispute about them, on the second examination Mr. Reily insisted upon me having them and then these three bundles so sealed were put into a great bundle, and that was sealed. This is the bundle of trinkets.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. That pocket book I know it is worth half a crown, here are six rings altogether in this box they are worth about 3 l. and I suppose the beads in the box are worth 10 s. in this box there are three pair of ear rings, they are worth 1 l. the rings and necklaces I have no doubt they are mine, I am well acquainted with them and these little things of trinkets are worth 5 s. altogether, all these articles I missed from my drawer in my dressing table, probably I saw them all the day before I missed them. This is one of Mr. Reily's shirts, there were four missed they are worth 12 s. I know the bag is mine I sewed it myself, these five tea spoons are worth 10 s. the tablecloth is mine it is marked M. B. the initials of my name before I was married. These handkerchiefs are mine, they are worth two shillings.</p>

            . I am a watchman. On the 27th of April between twelve and one o'clock, I was walking up this passage, I heard an alarm of stop thief, I turned back and met a person at the corner of the passage, I ran against him and he against me. I stopped the prisoner, he scrambled away from me and was taken about thirty yards from me, the prisoner dropped these articles, I picked them up, two gowns, a bonnet, and a petticoat, and some other articles, the prisoner was then taken to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>JOSEPH COOPER. I walked into the Almonry between the hours of twelve and one, I heard a noise at No. 7 in the Almonry, I went there and found the prisoner in custody, and the property was in the room along with him at the prosecutrix's house, I then took him, in company with the watchman, to the watch-house. I searched him, and found two one-pound notes in his pockets which he dropped on the floor, I afterwards took him to Tothil-fields Bridewell. This key dropped out of his pocket on the floor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find what lock that key belonged to. - A. No, I went back to the house afterwards, and found the staple lying where it had been drawn off, it was laying outside of the door in the passage. On looking further in the room, I found this iron crow on the bed, covered over with a corner of the rug that laid on the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was this. - A. Between the hours of twelve and one. The prisoner said after he was in custody a week or so that he should not have done it if he had not been drunk.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to say that. - A. I do not know, I mentioned to him, that it was a bad thing he should do so, he said he should not have done it if he had not been drunk.</p>

            . I live in the Almonry Westminster, next door to Mrs. Jones. I was standing at my door about half past twelve o'clock, I heard Mrs. Jones cry out stop thief, and the prisoner ran out of Mrs. Jones's door, the prisoner running by hit me on the arm as I stood at the door, he ran across the road, and dropped the property by Mr. Wright's passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him drop it. - A. Yes, he had it under his great coat, he ran off towards the other part of the Almonry, I was present when he was secured, I caught him by the coat. These are the things that were picked up.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. These gowns are mine, the bonnet and the habit shirt are mine, they are the property of my husband, his name is Durick Jones.</p>

               <p>Q. The house was broken open by drawing a staple was it not. - A. Yes, I went out about eleven o'clock, and returned about half past twelve.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, at the time I am charged with committing the robbery, I was in a state of inebriety, and how I came in the house I cannot say, all the recollection that I have of the transaction is being taken to the watch-house, and on the following day when I was at Tothill-fields, the woman who owned the property agreed to make up the matter provided I would make up one pound, I had not the money about me, but an acquaintance of mine offered to pay the sum, with which she was perfectly satisfied, and which was paid her by Mrs. Field. Under these circumstances I trust the court will take it into consideration, I have never been in a court of justice before in my life, and I have always conducted myself to the satisfaction of my employers, and can have a character from them all.</p>

On the 8th of April, about eight o'clock in the evening, the two prisoners came into my shop and enquired for some handkerchiefs; I shewed them a quantity of silk handkerchiefs, after looking at them a long time they purchased this one, Fonseca paid for it. Jose then enquired for some black silk handkerchiefs, they purchased one of them; they then enquired for some stockings, and while I was gone to a distant part of the shop to get the stockings, my apprentice, who had been watching them, gave me some information. In consequence of that I sent him for an officer, and when the officer came he took Fonseca's hat off. We found two parcels of black silk handkerchiefs therein, five in one, and seven in the other. Jose was searched, I believe nothing was found upon him, I had taken them handkerchiefs out of the box to shew them to the prisoners.</p>

I was watching them, and while my master was shewing them some black ones, I observed a piece of black silk handkerchiefs' between Jose's knee and the counter, and another piece on the floor.

I went home and saw the prisoner at my house, I told him I was much surprised to find that he had got a shop and I had seen a great deal of my property there and it remained with him to account how it came there. He said he had acted very wrong not letting me know that he had a shop, and the goods he had bought of me for a friend at Deal, instead of sending them to Deal he had kept them himself. He had represented to me before that he bought the goods for a friend at Deal, but instead of sending them to Deal he had taken them to his own lodgings, I told him if that was the case I would take the day book over to his lodgings and call over the goods, and I went there with the day book, we called over the goods and it pretty well tallied with the entry in the book - the book and the goods nearly corresponded but they were entered in another name.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 19th of April, between eight and nine in the evening, I stopped the prisoner in Worship Street, he was carrying this canvass, it was all in this outside wrapper, it looked like a truss. I asked him what he had got there, he said he had got this bundle to carry to a shop in the Borough, or to some Inn in the Borrough, I asked him whether he had a bill of parcels, he said no, I took him to the public-house next door to the office, and opened the bundle, and found it contained the goods now present, he told me it was to go to one Mr. Essey at Portsmouth, who kept an old iron shop. I took care of the property, and Bishop and my son went in search of the owner. I have had the property ever since.</p>

He came to me a second time, and asked me the same question, I put my hand to my pocket, I found I had lost my snuff-box; it was a silver gilt one. I followed the crowd, and the officer held up the snuff-box, I knew it to be mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You had been some time at the Opera. - A. Yes, I had just come out of the boxes.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sitting by the railing. - A. Yes, a good way from the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the house very full. - A. It was remarkably thin at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say whether your pressing against the railing might not have turned the snuff-box out of your pocket. - A. I did not perceive the man take it, I cannot say whether it fell out of my pocket by rubbing against the rails or no.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before. - A. No, not to my knowledge, I saw him place himself behind a gentleman who was sitting at the end of one of the seats, I saw the prisoner put his hand into the gentleman's pocket, but he did not succeed there, I was close behind the prisoner at the time, he then removed to the right hand seat of the centre of the pit, there he attacked another gentleman's pocket, he removed again, and as he removed I removed behind him, I immediately touched Humphrey's, my brother officer to follow him. He then went and placed himself behind<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290037"/>the prosecutor, Mr. Richardson. The prisoner then got as close against the rails as he could, he then cast his eyes downward, I saw him put his hand into Mr. Richardson's pocket, and as soon as he got the property he turned round directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see the property in his hand. - A. Not exactly at that time, I was perfectly satisfied that he had got something. I told Humphreys to ask Mr. Richardson if he had not had his pocket picked, I followed the prisoner, Humphreys came after me and said no, he had lost nothing, I insisted upon Humphreys going back again to Mr. Richardson, as I was sure he had something, and by that time the prisoner had got into the watercloset, I followed him into the watercloset, there I saw him looking at something, I could not see what it was, he dropped his hand very quick the moment he saw me, I returned out to see if I could see Humphreys, Humphreys came running and said the gentleman had lost his snuff box, then the prisoner was just going into the pit again. When he got into the pit I saw Humphreys had got hold of the prisoner's hands, I assisted Humphreys in bringing him out of the pit, and in his left hand side coat pocket I pulled out the snuff box, I held it up and called out for the owner, the prosecutor came forward and said it was his box. We immediately took the prisoner off to St. Martins watch-house. This is the snuff box.</p>

After I apprehended the prisoner, on our going to the watch-house, I said a respectable man like you, how came you to be guilty of this; he said it was the first thing he ever did in his life, I replied it is the first time that you were catched doing it.</p>

My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury, I stand here accused of a crime, which my situation in life, and the support I ever had from my business, always precluded me from want. I could have no motive whatever in the world for doing it. I came out of the boxes into the pit, and when I saw that box lay down, I took it up, I thought it belonged to Mr. Smith, a surgeon. I went into the water-closet, not with intent to look at the box, but with another motive. When I came out of the water-closet I went into the pit, to look for the gentleman that I thought owned it. Had I stolen it I should have made off with it. This officer says he followed me, how could he follow me, I never was a thief and this gentleman, Mr. Smith, he has been here all to day and yesterday, he has been gone away I believe an hour, he thought my trial would not come on; if he had been here to day, and had shown his box, you would have seen how much they were alike. Still I believe there will be enough witnesses called, whose words will go further than a Bow-street officer's. I believe my Lord you know that Bow-street officers is not very nice in what they say.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called four witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

As I was coming home that gentleman followed me, he tore my shawl almost in two, he said I have been robbed by two women, I will swear you are one, when I came to a watchman I gave charge of him, they took me to the Compter instead of taking my charge they took his. I never saw the handkerchief.</p>

I took the lad, he conducted himself well till on Saturday evening the 4th of May; my servant maid went to my butchers, he informed her that the lad had taken up two pound of mutton chops in my name. He did not lodge with me he lodged with a brother in law. On Saturday night he received his wages, he might have paid for them on Monday. I questioned him, he acknowledged he had them, I asked him if he had been in the habit of taking any thing, he said not, at last he acknowledged that he had taken one pocket book home to his brother, I asked him why his brother did not bring it home to me. The prisoner was searched and we found a silver pencil case and silver thimbles upon him, which he acknowledged taking out of a drawer in my accompting house. I got an officer, we searched his lodgings, I found a key on him which he said would open his box, with that key I opened his box, in the box I found a variety of articles belonging to me, and in his brothers box I also found things belonging to me; I brought the things home and put him into custody.</p>

I asked him whether he had got any thing improper about him, he said he had not; I told him I should not be satisfied without he went back with me and let me examine him. He then said he had a little bark; I took him back and searched him, and found in his coat pocket and his hat, three pound of bark, it is worth six shillings, the bark was the property of the London Dock Company.

               <p>Q. When you got up early in the morning or when at bed time. I ask you have not you seen him in that room morning, noon, and night. - A. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not know that the prisoner had given her a ticket of three pounds a month to draw his wages. - A. That I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not Ferguson get up when the husband came into the room and endeavour to push him out. - A. No. he said I came here to do murder. It was after he had stabbed her that Ferguson arose.</p>
               <p>Q. Then I am to understand from you that Ferguson did not offer any violence to the prisoner until after the blow was given by the prisoner. - A. He did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you examined before the Coroner. - A. Yes, and I gave the same account then.</p>
               <p>THOMAS FERGUSON. Q. You knew Colley and his wife did not you. - A. Yes, I have known them about twelve or fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the room at the time this unfortunate circumstance happened. - A. Yes, it was on the 12th of May, I saw the prisoner come in, I was in the deceased's room, when the prisoner came in I was sitting on a chair, Mrs. Colley was sitting at the table cutting bread and butter at the time, and when the prisoner came into the house the first words that he repeated were, Here I come, it is my wedding day and I am come to make a murdering day of it; immediately as these words came out he plunged the knife into the bowels of the deceased, with that I arose up immediately off the chair and went towards the prisoner, I asked him if he had come to commit murder, and with that he made a pluage at me with the same knife which time the knife penetrated through my waistcoat and shirt and just grazed my skin, with that I waded it off with my hand, it did no further injury than just graze my skin, he made the second plunge at my breast, I struck him across the breast and he staggerd back into a chair.</p>
               <p>Q. You struck him into a chair. - A. Yes, when he made the second plunge at me I immediately secured his arms, got hold of the knife and took it from him, and when I wrenched the knife from him, I gave it to Mr. Elias, who came into aid and assist me, and for a few minutes I held him in the same state that I had him when I wrenched the knife out of his hands, after that I let go the prisoner, he arose up from the chair, he said I hope I have finished her and he was very sorry he had not finished me the same, I asked Mr. Elias to take charge of the prisoner and not to let him go out of the house, I went out of the house with the intention of going for an officer, instead of that, finding there was no doctor to assist the deceased I went and found a doctor, he came immediately and then I ran to look for an officer, I met an officer coming about three or four hundred yards from the house, I returned back with the officer to the deceased house, I gave charge of the prisoner, the officer took him away.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew the prisoner, did not you. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q.Had he been separated from his wife at all. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it since he saw her last. - A. I cannot really say. The last time I saw him was about a month before the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he living with his wife then. - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you tell us whether there was any dispute between the deceased and her husband. - A. Not a word passed between them.</p>
               <p>Q. You lodged in the same house, did you not. - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. You lodged in the same house, which bed did you sleep in. - A. Generally in the two pair when I slept in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to tell me upon your oath that always when you were in the house at night you slept in the two pair. - A. Yes, I do mean to tell you so, at my first going into the house I slept in the first floor, and after the first floor was occupied I went and slept in the two pair room.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you. - A. I am a seaman.</p>
               <p>Q. You told my Lord that it was a month before that, that man was in his house. - A. That I saw the man in the yard.</p>

            's house. He had not been in a minute before I heard the cry of murder, I went towards the house, I met the deceased coming out of the house bleeding, saying, I am stabbed, I left her and went into the deceased's house, I saw Ferguson having hold of the prisoner on a chair, the prisoner had a knife in his hand, I saw Ferguson take the knife out of his hand, Ferguson turned round to me and said, Mr. Elias you take the knife, I took the knife and put it into my side pocket. I told Ferguson to let him go and to go for an officer. I staid with the prisoner until the officer came.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner attempt to get away. - A. No, when Mr. Lucas, the officer, came I gave him in charge and the knife also, the deceased died that evening.</p>
               <p>MR. RICHARDSON. I am a surgeon, I saw the deceased on the 12th of May, between five and six o'clock in the evening. I found her in a state of insensibility, I found a wound about three-quarters of an inch in length on the lower part of the left side of the abdomen.</p>
               <p>Q. With what instrument did it appear to you that the wound was inflicted. - A. It must be some sharp instrument, it was a smooth wound.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the consequence of that wound. - A. Whether she died of the wound or not it is impossible for me to say, whether that was the cause of her death, as I did not open her body, it is impossible for me to say.</p>
               <p>Q. You can tell me this, whether it appeared such a wound as might be the cause of her death. - A. It did.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290042"/>Q. When did she die. - A. I was called to her about ten o'clock in the evening and found her dead.</p>
               <p>Q. After you found her dead, did you examine the body. - A. Nothing farther.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you cannot tell whether she died of that wound or not. - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I think you said this, that it was such a wound as might probably occasion her death. - A. It certainly was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any thing else about her that was likely to occasion her death. - A. I saw nothing else.</p>
               <p>Q. Now be so kind as to tell us how often you saw her after you first saw her? - A. I was called in between five and six in the evening I dressed the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me how deep the wound was. - A. I cannot say how deep it was, it was about an half, or three-quarters of an inch in length. I ordered her to be put to bed, she revived a little, I then left her. About nine o'clock I sew her again, and found her quite insensible, I gave her some stimulating medicines, she recovered and was able to speak, she exclaimed, Oh my belly, oh my back. She was very restless, I left her then, it was about nine o'clock; about ten o'clock I was sent for again, when I arrived I found her dead.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray Sir, in your judgment, seeing all this and being sent for again and again, what, in your opinion, was the cause of her death. - A. In my opinion that wound was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you what in your opinion as a medical man was the cause of her death. - A. In my opinion that wound was the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it. - A. I have no doubt about it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is the question I asked you before. - A. I did not understand your lordship, I could not swear that was the cause of her death, but I have no doubt about it. I wanted to open the body, but the father of the deceased would not admit it.</p>

            . I went to the deceased's house, the prisoner was setting in the arm chair, there were several people in the room. I asked which was the man that stabbed the woman, he said, here I am; I asked the prisoner if he had stabbed the woman, he said yes, he had, I asked him if he had got any more weapons about him, he said no he had not, I searched him and found none, he got up, I told him I must confine him, he said I had no occasion to do that, he should go very quietly with me, I insisted upon tying his hands, he gave me a handkerchief himself to do it. Mr. Elias tied his hands while I held him. This is the knife that Elias gave me he said, that it was the knife with which he had stabbed the woman.</p>
               <p>Q.(to Elias) Did you give 
               <persName id="t18110529-53-person466">Lucas</persName>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I am troubled with fits, and being out of my mind at times by this man and this woman treating me as they have done for two or three years past, I might have done it, but one half what they say is false. This man cohabited with my wife, and when I came home, he turned me out of the house. On the Wednesday before I went to the house, and that very woman that has sworn against me, I trod upon her toes almost. She and my wife shut the window down, that women shut the door. I went to the hospital and sent for my wife, she sent me word that she would not come, she wished me better, I have a fracture on my skull, and sometimes I am out of my mind.</p>

            . I am a sea-faring man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time sail in company with the prisoner. - A. Yes, in an East Indiaman, in the Ceylon; I was ship steward, and the prisoner was boatsman.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time that you were in company with him on board that ship, did you observe any thing particular in his conduct. - A. On the evening he left St. Helena, in May, 1806, or the beginning of June, I had been in the carpenter's cabin, in company with the Carpenter and the captain's steward. I left there at ten o'clock, we retired to our separate beds; in a few minutes the carpenter sent to me for a light, which I sent him, and immediately followed myself; I found the carpenter and the captains steward breaking open the prisoners door, and when the door was opened, we found the prisoner laying on his cot, his throat cut in a most dreadful manner. We sent for Mr. Newberg the surgeon, he with a great deal of trouble sewed up the wound, the prisoner was very restless during the time, and attempting to tear it open. Upon examination, we found a razor under the bed, and the whole of the night he attempted to tear the wound open; the carpenter and I sat up with him the whole of the night, and we were obliged to have a man to be with him the next day. The whole of that night he appeared deranged, he fancied he saw a man with a bundle of ratans.</p>
               <p>Q.Had you an opportunity of knowing whether he had been at that time allowing his wife any maintenance. - A. His wife received his monthly money, due to him; if ever he took a drop of liquor it turned him into a state of derangement, he was refrained from liquor the whole passage out.</p>
               <p>COURT. When he was refrained from liquor he was in his perfect senses was he. - A. When he refrained from liquor he was.</p>
               <p>CHARLES BALE. Q. I understand you were a mess-mate with this man. - A. I sailed with him on board another ship, the Isabella, a West-Indiaman, in last July, he always seemed to be a man comical in his senses, and not like another man, he kept walking by himself fore and aft on the deck, and would not be sociable with any one. I was in St. Thomas's hospital with him a week before this happened, he there seemed strange and totally insensible. On Sunday about four o'clock in the day, the mischief was done, he left the hospital, he put up his crokery ware, knife and fork, and some other dirty things in a dirty shirt, and carried it with him, I saw no more of him afterwards until he was in custody.</p>
               <p>COURT. If he was out of his senses, how came you to let him go at large. - A. Nobody has any business to stop any person from going out, if I had known his business, I would have gone with him.</p>

            . I was nurse in the ward in St. Thomas' hospital where the prisoner was, I have observed him several times to be in a deranged state, he would get up in the night, and wander about, and talk to himself.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290043"/>I have advised him to reconcile himself and content himself in bed, or I should be obliged to state it to the serjeant, he would try other means, to which I have had but a slight answer from him, he seemed to be in a melancholy state.</p>
               <p>GEORGE CHANBERLAIN. Q. I understand you were an officer on board the ship in which this man sailed, the Ceylon. You have heard that fact of the prisoner cutting his throat, do you know that fact. - A. Certainly, and his conduct was generally so strange, that those officers whom it was usual for him to mess with would not associate with him. And one instance besides, I now consider when the ship was in distress in the River Thames, and I expected from him, as boatswain, great assistance, he refused it, and took a boat and left the ship in that dangerous situation.</p>
               <p>COURT. When was it he cut his throat. - A. In some part of May, 1806.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you sail with him afterwards. A. I think it was between two and three months that we arrived in England.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you send him to any hospital. - A. We had a surgeon on board the ship, he sewed up the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the surgeon treat him afterwards as an insane man. - A. He was not trusted with any command afterwards.</p>
               <p>SUSANNAH GILLAM. I live in Worcester Street, St. George's in the East, I am a married woman and let out lodgings. On the 2nd of February the prisoner came to lodge at my house, he lodged there eight or nine days. He frequently at his meals would jump up and throw his knife and fork away, and walk backwards and forwards in the kitchen, and speak very incorrectly about some person, and by his discourse I suspected it to be his wife, he would get out of bed of a night, and walk backwards and forwards in the room, talking to himself. I did not think him in his right senses, he would frequently in his exclamations say, Oh God protect me. I have frequently observed him, when he has been in this way, to go into the yard and wash his head over to make it cool. About the 8th or 10th of February, he left me in the morning, he asked me for a little money, which I gave him; he told me he was going to be paid by the ship. I did not see him for four or five days, then he came and told me that his wife had arrested him, and seemed to be in great agitation of mind. After he paid me he left me, and I saw no more of the prisoner until I saw him in Newgate.</p>

            . Q. You are wife to the last witness are you. - A. Yes, on the 16th of April last, we were going through Great George Street in our way home, it was about half-past one in the morning, the child was asleep in my arms, I and Mrs. Newman were about five or six yards from our husbands; two young men came from the other side of the way and insulted me and Mrs. Newman, they made a blow at me, and instead of hitting me they hit the child, the child cried out.</p>
               <p>Q. How old is the child. - A. Five year old. Mr. Newman and my husband came up, my husband said what do you want, Hughes made use of bad words and said, what do you want, a scuffle ensued between my husband and the two prisoners, another young man came up, he knocked Mr. Newman's hat off, and ran away. Hughes knocked my husband on his knee, they were then on the road, and I was on the pavement, and when I saw Ruby and Hughes were both falling on my husband, I said Lane where is your watch, he put his hand to his fob and said it was gone, and he said my braces is broke. I immediately ran over to him in the road and laid hold of Hughes; and saw the key of the watch in his hand, his hand was clenched I could not see the watch, I called the watchman. Hughes said he would knock my life time out if I did not let him go, two gentlemen came up and assisted me till the watchman came up, and took him. I gave charge of him, I got the watch out of his hands myself. In dragging the watch out of his hands the case came open, I carried the watch to the watch-house, and gave it to the watch-house keeper.</p>

I saw at the window that a person could come out of the one pair of stairs into that cockloft. I asked them who lived in the one pair of stairs, they told me a man and woman had quarrelled, they had gone to George alley, and they kept the key of that room. I went into George alley and found the prisoner, I asked her where her husband was she said he would be at home to breakfast, he came, and I took him in custody, I searched the room, I found a five shilling paper of half-pence in a table drawer, and nine loose one. I took the prisoner and her husband to the watchouse, I searched them I found nothing on the man, the woman gave me some halfpence out of her pockets, I searched her pockets afterwards, I found two or three more in it, that made ten, what she gave me and what I took out of her pocket. I shewed Mrs. Haswell the halfpence she owned two of them that were found on her person.

I was sitting in the cart behind, I could not see plainly how it was; I saw the waggon coming with three or four horses, the prisoner had the whip in his hand.

               <p>Q. Did he appear to intend coming in contact with the cart - A. He did not stay when he was called to. I called to him to mind his horses, and directly as I called to him the cart was overturned.</p>
               <p>Q. What I want to know is, was it his fault, or could he get out of the way - A. Yes, there was room for the waggon to get out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the deceased - A. He was sitting by the side of the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he reins - A. Yes. The cart was throwed over. I jumped out of the cart, and the deceased fell under the shafts.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether the prisoner intended to do it for the purpose - A. I could not see it plainly whether he did or not; he did not offer to stop the waggon when he was called to.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that he heard you - A. I dare say he heard, because one answered.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it carelessly done - A. He did not appear to draw the waggon of one side when he was called to.</p>
               <p>Mr Gurney. This was a coal waggon full of coals - A. Yes, and it was drawn by three or four horses.</p>
               <p>Q. You were sitting behind at first, you did not see how it was - A. Yes; I was sitting behind, I did not see it till afterwards where the coalman was. The deceased called out four or five feet before they met.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say the deceased's cart was stopped before the wheels met - A. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the two wheels meet in an instant after the deceased called out - A. No; the small wheel struck first, and then afterwards the large wheel struck and overset the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Might it not be done by accident - A. I think it was through neglect it was done.</p>
               <p>JAMES GILLAM. Q. Were you with the cart - A. Yes, I was sitting by the side of the man that was driving the cart. The cart was on the left hand side of the lane, and the waggon on the right; they were both going a regular pace, we met the waggon, the carman called out to the coal waggoner to give him room, the waggoner did not draw up at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How much more room could he have given him - A There was a great deal of room on the other side, our cart was close to the curb, we could not give more room than we did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Corey. What is the width of the road there - A. I have measured the road there, sixteen feet eight inches from curb to curb.</p>
               <p>Gillam. The small wheel struck the cart, and the large wheel over turned the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Now how much was there to spare from the side of the waggon to the curb-stone - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. I want to know what the prisoner could have done to prevent that - A. He might have drawn off.</p>
               <p>Q. What room was there to have drawn off - A. I cannot say. The deceased cried out to him, and he made no answer.</p>

I was at the public-house, I was in the parlour, I looked through the parlour window into the yard; I saw the prisoner strip, and the deceased in the act of stripping in the yard. They retired into a back room to fight, the deceased finishing stripping in the back room. I followed them into the back room; I followed them into the back room. The deceased was equal in height to the prisoner, but the deceased was thinner after being stripped. I saw a man draw a line across the ground for them to come up to fight, and there they met and shook hands before they began, and after they began they had a short round, the deceased fell; there were two or three blows exchanged, but of no consequence, as I conceived; the deceased was picked up, and they had another round; the prisoner's nose bled, and they fell both together; the deceased fell undermost, that round was nearly the same length as the other; I saw the prisoner strike him one or two blows in the body,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290046"/>but not very forcibly to do any harm, as I conceived; he was then picked up and put on the bench, and the fight was put a stop to by Moiler the landlord coming in. That is all the fight there was; and all I saw. I went into the parlour where I came from; in about half an hour afterwards I had occasion to go backwards, I saw the deceased standing in the yard in the act of trying to make water, he said he could not, for he was troubled with the gravel.</p>

On the 24th of April, about two o'clock I came home, I heard that there had been a dispute between the deceased and the prisoner, I went directly into the taproom, the deceased was standing up with his fist clenched in the prisoner's face, the deceased called him a thief, saying he had collected money on a gathering and made use of it for himself; the prisoner denied the charge; the deceased called him a liar, and said he would fight him then, or any other time for ten pound; a man of the name of Jones pulled out a one pound note to lend to the deceased; I snatched the note out of his hand; I put one in one settle, and the other in another; they promised they would be quiet then; they were both very drunk; I left them quiet and went into the parlour, that is all I saw of it; I did not see the fight in the yard, the yard is detached from the house; I was told there was a fight; I went in and stopped it in the last round; none of the fighting I saw; they ceased fighting when I came in; I would not suffer it.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw John Barrlett, about three o'clock, on the 25th of April, at his lodging, I understood from him and his wife that his principal complaint was want of power to make water; he seemed very languid; and the region of the bladder was very much extended, as if the bladder was very full, from the external appearance, and the whole of the belly in fact. I immediately proceeded to draw of the urine by a catheter. I drew off a pint and half of fluid, which appeared blood and urine mixed together.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you told that he had been fighting the day before - A. Neither the deceased or the wife told me that he had been fighting; I enquired what sort of health he had before; I wanted to account for this appearance; he said he had a pain in his back, and had passed some gravel by urine. He was relieved by drawing off the urine, but remained very ill; he was getting very languid every time I saw him. I saw him two or three times the two first days, I found it necessary to use the catheter again, and the second time there was a smaller discharge; he continued growing worse and worse, and died on the Sunday morning following, the 28th. I opened him the same day, about three o'clock in the afternoon, the first thing that presented itself was a rupture of one of the intestines; a laceration of one of the intestines, and in that cavity which the bladder should occupy, there was a large quantity of grumous blood, which upon taking out, I discovered that the bladder was ruptured likewise.</p>
               <p>Q. From these circumstances you have no doubt that his death proceeded from the laceration of the intestines and the rupture of the bladder - A. Exactly so.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you of opinion as a medical man that the blows he received in the course of that fight could have occasioned the laceration of the bowels, and the rupture of the bladder - A. It is necessary for me to state that his bladder appeared to me to be in a diseased state, and that at one time of life he had great inflammation on the surface of his bowels, I have not a doubt of it, in consequence of which, what we call adhesions, had taken place - parts growing together, His liver adhered so close to his side that it required great force to detach it; the caul, which covered the belly, was almost obliterated, and what there was adhered to the sides. I consider the cause of his death to have been from a violent exertion, tearing away these adhesions; in this diseased state even if he had stumbled and endeavoured to recover himself, he might have done that mischief.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps I understand you to say that you could not discover any appearance on the body that seemed to be occasioned by any blows - A. No, that might be done by a punch in the belly; I saw no marks, neither external nor internal.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and gentlemen of the Jury I drank with the deceased some time on that day, he mentioned that I had gathered money for a sick member and kept it, this was proved to the contrary; then we became comfortable, and drank together again; he then said I was not so good a man to the society as he was, that I was no man; he put his fist three times in my face saying that was my master. If I had been sober I should not have fought with him.</p>

We calculated the quantity for the three shirts to be ten yards and a half; I took down a piece of irish to shew him, he then wished me to measure him ten yards and a half off, and on my moving a little to the right, I saw a piece of irish under Bereman's jacket, he stood behind Mears, which gave me suspicion, I immediately gave Mr. Newbury a signal of suspicion, he immediately went out of doors to watch them, Bereman settled very much confused, and told Mears to have the whole piece measured over, that he would take three at the same time, that was ten yards and a half more; In the mean time that I was measuring over the remnant of irish, Bereman put the piece of irish on the chair; I measured the piece over, it was twenty yards, I agreed to let them have it at twenty shillings each, I thought the price might be too high, I went to get another piece, and on my return, saw Bereman put it under his jacket a second time, they then agreed to take the remnant of twenty yards; immediately Bereman went towards the door, saying to Mears that he was going to fetch the money to pay for it; I stopped him, and searched him, I found nothing upon him; Mr. Newbury came in, and asked what was the matter; I told him that I had seen a piece of irish under his jacket, I suspected that he had got something more; Mr. Newbury sent out for two watchmen, they came in and searched them, they found nothing; the prisoner Bereman agreed for our little boy to go with them to their lodgings, and he should bring us the money; I said it was not proper that a boy should go, that one of us should go; we left Bereman in the shop, and me and the porter went with Mears, he went into a public house, had half a pint of beer, our porter came in with two watchmen, we seized him, and brought him to the watch-house, and on his being searched there, a scarf was found upon him.</p>

            . I am butler to Mr. Canning, his house almost joins the Almshouses. On the 26th of April, about two o'clock in the morning, I was at Mr. Canning's gate, leading to Kensington, I heard a knocking, I went to the house and called to the servant Matthew, and we went together to where the knocking continued; I went close to the man, it was dark. I observed he had something between his knees, and he was chopping. I asked him what he was doing of, he said he was chopping some wood; he got up and ran away, I pursued him and caught hold of him, he got loose again, tumbled into a ditch; he got out and tried to get away the second time; I then caught him, and he struck me over the hand with something which I wrested from him, it proved to be a piece of pipe; I then led him into Mr. Canning's house, and secured him, and in the morning I went for an officer. In our way back we went to the place, there were several bits of lead chopped, we matched the lead, it exactly fitted with the remaining piece, he told me that the piece of lead he had in his hand he was knocking up</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street. On the 26th of April the last witness came for me, I went to Brompton; in our way we went to see what the man had been chopping; I found the head of the pump in a ditch, where it had been buried; this piece that the first witness took from him matched with the piece of lead remaining to the pump. It is part of the pump of the almshouses.</p>

On the 27th of March, about ten<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290050"/>o'clock in the morning, a person came into my shop for change of a one pound note; I took a bag of silver out of my desk, and put it on the top of the desk; after I had given change for the one pound note, that person went out, and shut the door after them. I had occasion to go into my parlour which is just out of the shop, and leaving the bag of silver on the top of the desk; I had not been gone two minutes before I heard some person in the shop, and on my coming into the shop I saw the two prisoners at the bar, both going out in a great hurry; I ran after them a little way, but finding that they run so fast I could not overtake them, and having left no person in the shop; I returned back and called my wife into the shop, and then went in pursuit of the prisoners, I found them in Golden-lane in conversation with a woman, whom I supposed they were giving the property to; I saw them give her something, but could not see what.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know them before - A. I never saw them before they went out of my shop; after they parted with the woman I traced them to Barbican; I enquired for a constable, and they were apprehended in Long-lane, we searched them and found nearly an equal part of money upon each.</p>

On Monday the 27th of May the prosecutor came to me, I went with him, and in Long-lane we apprehended these two lads; I laid hold of Bolton, the prosecutor laid hold of Bevan; Bolton said to me, Mr. Green, what is this for; I replied, that gentleman will let you know. We searched them both, we found eleven dollars, six half-crowns, eighteen shillings, nine sixpences, nine penny-worth of halfpence, and a penny-piece; I said to Bolton you have made away with a good deal of this money that you took; he said, no, we have not made away with any of it. I found the money nearly equally divided between them.</p>

On the 11th of April I had a tub of halfpence in the parlour, out of which I missed fifteen shillings worth of halfpence; I made search and found them all in the hay-loft I brought the prisoner into the parlour and charged the officer with him. When I first charged the prisoner with taking the halfpence he denied it; I then told the officer to take him to the watch-house; he then said he had never done such a thing before in his life, and he hoped I would forgive him.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I confess the fault I have committed; I took the halfpence to buy me some shirts; my father being poor and not having it in his power to let me have some. I am now convinced I ought not to have taken any, and in my unfortunate situation I most earnestly implore your lordship's lenity.</p>

            . I was constable of the night. When I went into the watchhouse I saw the prisoner sitting in the watchhouse, Raymond said he saw the prisoner come out of Bartholomew coffee-house; I searched him, I found a seven-shilling piece, a half-crown, a shilling and six-pence base money, and two or three shillings that were good, and two handkerchiefs in his hat. I looked under his chair, I saw them shoes. The pint pot was given into my hand, I said this was not found on the prisoner since I have been in the house: they said no, he had taken it from the mantle-shelf and given it to a man.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Kidd. Look at that pint pot - A. That is my pint-pot which was in the house at the time I was there. The coffee-pot has not been found.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I had spent the evening with a person of the name of Smith, who said he was a salesman in Smithfield; on my passing the house above mentioned a person came out and seemed to drop the articles that were found on me; I picked them up and had got scarcely twenty yards before I heard the cry of stop thief, I pursued and called stop thief; I lost sight of the man, and I was stopped; I told the watchman I would go any where with him; I was taken to the watchhouse, and after being there a few minutes I thought I might be suspected; I put the mug on the shelf, and the shoes under the chair; when the person came in I took the mug off the mantle piece, and said this is yours, I suppose.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called three witnesses, who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 20th of April, about four o'clock in the morning, I was alarmed by a violent noise at the door; I have two doors to my house, one in Red Cross-street, and the other in Three Tun-court; I laid in bed, still I heard the noise, I looked out of window, I heard three men in the passage in Three Tun-court, trying to break in, and I heard them talking; I stood with the window up five minutes, with my rattle in my hand; I could see nobody to assist me. The watchman came down Paul's-alley; I said watchman, you secure the court, there are thieves breaking into my house; I knew it was no thoroughfare. The moment he came up two of his comrades that stood at the court, one ran up Cradle-court, into Whitecross-street, the other ran the other way; he secured the court untill I came down. We went up the court, and we took the prisoner, and the moment I opened the door I saw the moulding and the staple of the door were all forced off by an iron crow, we found the iron crow, it fitted the marks in three places. We took the prisoner to the watchhouse; when he was before the Alderman he had the offer to go for a soldier; he said he would sooner swing first.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you pursue after him - A. No, I staid to take care of the rest. After I returned to Mr. Gole's premises in about a quarter of an hour the prisoner came in; Mr. Gole's premises is in the <placeName id="t18110529-70-crimeloc402">Back-road, St. George's in the East</placeName>

               <p>Q. Had you collared him, or laid hold of his person, to take him as a prisoner - A. No; my hand might have touched his clothes, as my left arm was up; I am not sure whether my hand did touch his clothes or not.</p>
               <p>Q.What was he - A. In Mr. Gole's premises, in the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you shut any gate upon him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How far had he come in when this took place - A. About twenty or thirty yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you had not collared him, or gave him the idea that you were going to stop him - A. I had not collared him nor stopped him when he ran the knife into my left arm. - I cannot say how deep the wound was; there was a great deal of blood came from the wound. After he had stabbed me in the arm he attempted to run out of the yard, I ran after him to prevent him from making his escape, as he got to the gate I got hold of him he stabbed me in the thick part of the thigh with a knife. It was a small wound, but I had a great deal of pain with it; it is not perfectly well now. It was a very small pointed knife.</p>
               <p>Q.Have you once seen the knife - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>COURT. Both cuts were done with a knife - A. Yes</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Gole. When he was apprehended was the knife taken from him - A. Yes, by me; this is the knife.</p>
               <p>Clare. That appears to be the same knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he after having stabbed you in the thigh this way get away from you - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he the knife in his hand when you first saw him - A. I did not see him take it out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q.When you asked him what he had gone away for what did he say to you - A. He made me no answer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that you would take him on board - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you advance towards him - A. No, he advanced towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put out your hand with intent to take him - A. No, not then.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you put out your hand to him for - A. To stop him to speak to him.</p>
               <p>Q. You had spoke to him before - A. He stabbed me at that very instant in the arm, when I asked him what he left the boat for. I did not see the knife until after he had stabbed me in the arm.</p>
               <p>Q. He had no time to open it, had he - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. There he must have it in his hand at the time what could be your reason for putting out your hand to stop him - A. To speak to him; he was walking on fast to the barrack-yard when I put out my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean to do with him when you stopped him - A. Nothing at that time; Mr. Gole was not at home, I wanted to ask him the reason why he ran away from the boat.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was he from the house door at this time - A. Four or five yards; he was going towards the house; I did not lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other Lascars in the house at the time - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you want to stop him to prevent the others from taking part with him - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you under any apprehension that he might induce them to leave the house in a holly, or take part with him - A. No. I am certain I did not lay hold of his person before I received this wound.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That gentleman wanted to send me to the ship, I told him I did not belong to the Company at the time that he laid hold of my clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Clare. Had you struck him, or had you any quarrel with him going down to the ship - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this man permitted to go out of the house to take exercise - A. Yes, without any body in the care of him, and they are expected to return at a particular hour. This man was under no restraint in Mr. Gole's house. I and another man took nine or ten men from Mr. Gole's house to the boat they walked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see this man leave the Company when they got to the boat - A. No,</p>
               <p>Q. Had he got to Mr. Gole's house before you perceived it - A. No. I got into the house first, I did not see him in my way to Mr. Gole's house.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way from Mr. Gole's house to the ship did you or any other man make use of any threats to force him on board - A. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. There was another man with this man, they took hold of me.</p>
               <p>Clare. There was another man with me, an acquaintance of mine who came to see me, he did not attempt to lay hold of him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The other man pinioned me back by holding me.</p>
               <p>Clare. That is not so, nor did the man lay hold of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to be at Mr. Gole's on the 21st of April - A. Yes; I saw the prisoner come down the yard, I did not perceive the knife then, nor when Clare asked him what he ran away for from the boat; the prisoner made no answer, but directly stabbed him in the arm with the knife; I did not see Clare lay hold of him, if he had, I must have seen him; I was looking at him. I saw the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290054"/>prisoner stab him in the arm, then he went directly towards the gate from whence he came. He was going into the barracks when Clare spoke to him, I and Clare followed him, and laid hold of him at the gate, and then he stabbed him in the thigh; then he came towards me to stab me, I hit him on the side of his head with my stick, then I got outside of the gate to stop him, and he made a strike at me; I struck him and he fell; that blow could not hurt him, and I got no mischief.</p>
               <p>COURT. He stabbed at you did he - A. Yes, and after he got up again he held up the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You think he fell in consequence of some false step, and not in consequence of your blow - A. No, it was not my blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not the other man a stick as well as you - A.No. Clare had not a stick.</p>

               <p>Q. to Oliver. Did Clare bleed a great deal - A. Yes, he did, and it was a small knife like that he cut him with. I could not swear to the knife.</p>

            . Q. Did you go with Mr. Gole for the purpose of apprehending the prisoner - A. Yes. Mr. Gole entered the room before me, I followed him, and as he went to speak to the prisoner, the prisoner was behind the table, he was coming round; I was going to take him, he stabbed me through the coat and breeches, in to my belly, I was sixteen days in the hospital, and it was eleven days before they would suffer me to get out of my bed. I am not well now, and I am afraid I never shall; I cannot strain at any thing, or walk fast.</p>
               <p>Q. While they were in the house were they under any restraint - A. They went out when they pleased; they were kept in no restraint; the gate is never locked before twelve and one o'clock in the morning.</p>

On the evening of the 25th of April the prisoner Smith came to my house and asked me to change her a twenty pound note; upon my taking the note and looking stedfastly at her, I perceived her countenance become pale; I then asked her if it was her husband's pension. (I believe her husband is a Chelsea pensioner), She said no, though her husband was poor he had good friends; he had it sent him. I took the note and wrote Smith upon it; I then gave Smith change for it.</p>

               <p>Q. Now look at the prisoner at the bar do you know his person. - A. Very well, he came into the shop on Saturday the 25th of May, a quarter past eight in the evening, it was very light, he came in by himself, he asked me to look at some watches, I shewed him some silver watches, he objected to them, he asked me to shew him some gold ones which I did, he asked me the price, I told him the watch was marked twenty three pound, then he asked me to shew him a chain and a gold seal he said he would bargin with me for them altogether, I told him the price of them altogether was twenty-five pounds, he said he would give me twenty-three pounds for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body else in the shop. - A. Not at that time no one besides himself. I said I would put it down on paper and if we did not lose by them he should have them as the stock was selling off under prime cost, he told me to put them together, I put them together the chain on the watch and the seal and key on the watch chain, I was inside of the counter and he outside, I came round the counter I was coming towards the door where he stood, I then gave him the watch into his hand, he put the watch up to his ear and said it did not go, I was then on the same side of the counter that he was, he moved back towards the door as near as he could and immediately bolted out of the door as hard as he could run, I ran after him crying stop thief, he had the watch and chain in his hand, he ran off immediately he got out of the door down in the middle of the street, I ran after him a fast as I could crying stop thief.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose there were a great many people in the street. - A. A great number, the pavement was so full he could not well run down the pavement, he ran as far as Craigs-court, about an hundred yards from our house he ran down there he was over taken and stopped, I saw him taken, he was knocked down by somebody and taken, I was not five yards from him the whole time; when he fell the outside case by this fall flew off, I saw the watch taken out of his hand when he was on the ground, a person laid hold of him by the collar and with the other hand he took the watch from him as he lay on the ground, I had hold of him at the time and the man that took the watch out of his hand gave it into mine, I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the door of the privy shut. - A. It was fastened up by a gimblet, it would turn the same as a button would, there was some hay there for the sheep to feed upon. I saw the prisoner near ten o'clock at home in his own pair of stairs room, I had taken the sheep away and returned and waited for his coming home. I knocked at the door, he said he would be d - d if he opened the door, I told him it was of no use, I would come in, after that he opened the window, he said what do you want, I said Mr. Bloxham I want you, he said he would be d - d before he would be handled about by any such d - d rascals as me, he said he would come forward the next morning and he would punish me severely for stealing his sheep, I told him I did not mind that, if he did not come down I would break the door open, I sent a young man to fetch a hatchet to chop the door open, he heard me, he came down and I took him in custody.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On Wednesday morning last Mr. Smith, a brick maker came into my house, he works just opposite, he said</p>
               <p>"Bloxham, there is a sheep run up the brick field," I said I would go after it, I might know the mark, I brought the sheep out, I asked Mr. Clark to open his gate, I said, this sheep belongs to some butcher, it is marked with a B. Mr. Clark immediately opened his door, I put the sheep into his place, and borrowed a bit of string of him, and took the sheep down to my house. I said to Mr. Clark, you know I have got the sheep, if any body makes enquiry send them to my house. I went to four butchers at Somerstown and left the mark there. I came home about a quarter before eight o'clock at night, my wife came and said they had hauled my sheep away.</p>

            . I apprehended the prisoner, I found her new rigged out in new wearing apparel, on the evening of the same day I found her old clothes in the back yard, I searched her and found only a few halfpence on her, Mrs. Haines got half way here yesterday, and to day she is not able to come.</p>

            . I am a surveyor of the Thames Police office.</p>
               <p>Q. On the 17th of May in the afternoon were you on the river. - A. I was about five o'clock, I was in Blackwall Reach on the Kent side opposite of Black-wall. There were two Indiamen one of the name of Severn, nigh <placeName id="t18110529-82-crimeloc476">Blackwell Dock</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t18110529-82-crimeloc476" type="placeName" value="Blackwell Dock"/>

He was on the Middlesex side, I saw him row to the stern of a lighter which laid aground on the point, he stopped there and he was out of my sight for a few minutes, I got down to him and just as I got there he had in his hand a small line apparently having something under water, he instantly dropped that line into the water upon seeing me, I had come round the craft, then I got into his boat, I found in that a piece of coire rope that is manufactured in the East Indies, and another piece weighing forty-two pounds. I then desired one of my men to put the boat hook down which they did immediately and with the boat hook they brought up a piece of buoy rope, weighing an hundred and a half, and another piece of rope, it appeared a topsail halliard, eighty four pounds, they were fast together and a small piece of line to the buoy rope, which appeared to me to be the piece of line that the prisoner dropped, I directed them to fish again, the prisoner said there was no more, we had the whole of them. This is the coir rope it will not sink. Afterwards I went on board the Severn, I found she was an indiaman. This tally was picked up in the boat and given to me in the prisoner's presence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. This man was in the river he had got a drag. - A. Yes, he said while he was in the boat he picked up this with the drag but this coire rope will not sink it was in his boat.</p>
               <p>LUTEN. I was in the boat with Mr. Evans, I have heard what he has said and the account he has given is correct, after we had fished them up the prisoner took a piece of canvas off one of the ropes we took up threw it down in the boat and put his foot on it, I desired him to lift his foot up and let me see what it was, he did, I picked it up and gave it to Mr. Evans, it is called a tally.</p>
               <p>EVANS. This is the forty-two pound rope and this is the buoy rope, this is the top sail halliard, and this is the small line attached to it, that is what he had in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the worth of all these. - A. Five pound.</p>

            . I am officer. On Sunday evening about seven o'clock, Gingell came to me; he said he was robbed of a watch, some silver and a pound note, and a gold seal. He took me to Pear Street; we went to the Green Man and Still, he shewed me Nance Williams, and said that was the prisoner; I searched her, I found nothing on her but two shillings; she said afterwards she would shew me the girl that had the watch. I found the watch at the One Tun in Perkins's rents, Mrs. Harding produced it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the prisoner a lodger of yours - A. He slept three nights in the house in a two pair of stairs room, there were three beds and bedding in the room. On the morning after Good Friday I missed two sheets out of the room. The prisoner was brought to my house on the Saturday by the officer; I knew the sheets when I saw them, they are worth two shillings.</p>
               <p>JOHN KINNERSLEY. I am an officer. I was sent for by Mr. Jones, a dealer in old clothes Sparrow corner; I there found the prisoner, he had a pair of sheets in his possession; I took the prisoner to the counter on suspicion; this was on Good Friday. The prisoner at the Mansion-house said who the sheets belonged to. He went with me to Mrs. Conigan, and Mrs. Conigan claimed the sheets. These are the sheets.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. They are my sheets.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. There was a woman with me, she went off before the constable came, I had been there five days, I went out drinking, and I had run out my money; I took them to the pawnbroker's to sell them.</p>

Having missed money repeatedly from the drawer of the table in my dining room I took the number and dates of some notes, and put them in my drawer, and locked it. On the morning of the 4th of April, about nine o'clock, I told them it was all right. In the evening I told them again one of them was missing, No. 0012, dated the 4th of March; I applied to the office, and two officers came with me to search all the servants, they found the one pound note in the possession of the prisoner in a box in his table drawer.</p>

             the officer, and in the prisoner's drawer we found this note. Mr. Chippenden said it was his. I asked him how he came by this note, he said he pawned a seal in Bishopsgate Street, and got the note, there at the office the prisoner was put off for a rehearing for him to bring the pawnbroker. The pawnbroker knew nothing of it, he did not appear.</p>
               <p>The prisoner said nothing in his defence, called two witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Q. Was Bolton one of them men - A. He was. He then went down with the other man towards the craft with the waggon to take the coals out, as soon as the waggon was loaded he drew up to the counting-house<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290065"/>to ask for the tickets; I observed the waggon and told him I believed he had more than twenty-one sacks in his waggon; he told me no he had not; I told him the situation of the sacks were such that induced me to believe that he had more; he told me no he had not, and stated that Bolton had forgot to pitch a seventh sack down on the near side, which accounted for the appearance of the waggon, having four sacks the last row of all. I told him I was not satisfied, and wished him to recollect whether he had more than twenty-one; he told me he certainly had not; I got upon the wheel of the waggon for the purpose of counting the sacks if I could, I was sure I counted twenty three, but they were so irregularly placed I was not certain whether they were twenty-four or no; I said to Manning I was not satisfied with the appearance of the waggon that he should draw up under the hay-loft window, and I would try to count them there; giving him an opportunity of being aware of my observations; and to take them out. The waggon stopped there, I endeavoured to count them, I could not do it precisely; twenty-three I was sure of, but I was doubtful of the fourth. He called to me as I was coming down stairs; are you satisfied, with a sneer; I told him I was satisfied, and he might go on; he went on; he should have gone straight on over Blackfriers bridge, into the Kent-road; I followed him down Fleet-street, I met Creswell the constable; I and Creswell followed the waggon, and instead of the waggon proceeding on the road it turned down by Rowland Hall's chapel, I followed, and we passed Union Hall. There we got another officer, his name is Clark. The waggon went into Snow's fields, it there stopped; upon its stopping Creswell desired me to fall back, so that I did not observe what was done by Manning; Creswell called me soon after, and told me they had detected the man delivering, and then I went into the house of

As the prosecutor was going by Union Hall Creswell came to me, and I followed the waggon into Snows-fields, and at the bottom of Snows-fields it stopped, Manning only was with the waggon, I saw Manning go to the tail of the waggon, and untie it, and take a sack of coals on his back, and take them some distance, and turn down into a small court; I saw him slide them off his back to get it under a railing, he got them into a house, I followed him, and saw him shoot them into a cupboard in Elizabeth Gray's house; I asked him what he was at; he said, selling a sack of coals; I told him that I was an officer, and must take him in custody.

The prisoner Manning was asking a woman for the Grange-house, the woman said she did not know the Grange-house; I told him to go on and turn the corner, it would take him to the Grange-road. He asked this woman if she would have a sack of coals; the woman said she had no money, or else she would; I asked him what a sack would be, he said three shillings and sixpence; I said I lived a good step, he must bring them me, I would give him three shillings and sixpence; I went on first, and he came after me; he took them out of his waggon on his back, and followed me in my house, and shot them in my closet, and then the officers, and Mr. Thatcher came in.</p>

            . Q. Were you very early in the morning passing Mr. Clack's house - A. At half after five, and I saw the prisoner Wellings coming out of Mr. Clack's house; Guernsey opened the door; Wellings had a bundle of soap under his left arm; I let him go on; I went further on and met him again in Old-street-road with the same bundle; I stopped him at No. 22, James-street, Old-street-road. I never lost sight of him; he had the same bundle with him that he had when he came out of Mr. Clack's house; I informed him that he had stolen property that did not belong to him; he begged for me to let him go, he said he was a soldier, if I took him he would receive five hundred lashes. I took him into custody, Mr. Ashworth assisted me; he said that he had it of his brother; I told him if I let him go I should compound felony. I took him back to Mr. Clack's house, Mr. Clack was not up; I knocked at the door, the prisoner Guernsey let me in; I told Guernsey to call his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290066"/>master, he went and called his master; I stopped in the shop some short time, his master did not come; I went up stairs and called Mr. Clack; I told him he had been robbed; he said he hoped it was not his servant; Mr. Clack followed me, I looked for the soap, and saw the soap removed where I had left it, it was put into the scale; I looked into the scale, and saw it was fourteen pound weight; Mr. Clack sent for a constable; there were some herrings found with the soap. I cannot say the quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Clack. Upon being called by the last witness you there saw the prisoners at the bar - A. Yes, and the prisoner Wellings was pointed out to me as the person that carried the soap away; the witness Ashworth told me to consider that he was a soldier, that he would receive five hundred lashes; I charged Guernsey of being guilty of it; he said he had sold it to the soldier, and he meant to pay me for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the morning was this - A. Between five and six o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had Guernsey your servant disposed of any soap and made any entery the night before - A. No, I have got my book here.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this the usual time for Guernsey to be up - A. He had no occasion to be up so early that morning, as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot speak to the soap being your property - A. No, because the soap maker sells to other people.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you red herrings - A. I had. I would not swear positively to the soap, but Guernsey told me he had sold it to Wellings.</p>

On the 25th of May the prisoner met me, he asked me if I was not going to 54, Russel-street; I was going home with a spencer; I told him yes; he took hold of the parcel, and gave me a penny, and said it ought to have been there long ago; I went with a parcel to another place, and delivered it; on my returning I went to 54, Russell-street, to hear whether he had left it; they said no, and just as I came out of the street I met the man that took it away from me; I took hold of him and asked him what he had done with the parcel; he halloaed Benjamin as loud as he could halloa, there was nobody answered; Mr. Gunn asked him why he did not give the boy his parcel; first he said he had not got it, he then said boy, come along with him, I will give you the parcel. He was going up by St. Giles's church, Mr. Gunn said, how far are you going to take us; he said a good way, and at Drury-lane he denied having the parcel. I am quite certain he is the man; I never found the parcel. It was between five and six o'clock that I was robbed.</p>
               <p>MR. GUNN. On the 25th of May, about five minutes before six in the evening, that boy and the prisoner were standing on the curb; I told the prisoner to give the boy his parcel; he said he had not got it, if he would go with him he would give him his parcel, and on our coming opposite of Drury-lane he denied all knowledge of the parcel, or that he ever had said he would give him the parcel. I took him to the office in Bow-street, he was searched and nothing found on him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The boy came running up to me and said, I have lost my bundle. It is impossible for any body to know where that boy was going.</p>

On the 15th of April, between three and four in the afternoon the prisoner and her sister were buying goods in my shop; I knew the sister but not her. The young lady that was serving them came to me, I then charged her with stealing the ribbon and she gave it me. This is the ribbon, it is mine. I believe she is not a person that goes about shop-lifting from what I have heard from her friends.</p>

            . I belong to Bow-street office. On the 7th of April I was on duty in Queen's-row, Islington, about eight in the evening, the prisoner passed me with a saddle and bridle, I asked him where he was going with that saddle; he replied to Mr. Thomas's, Saffron Hill; he had brought it from the Nag's Head, Enfield, he was ostler there. I went to Mr. Thomas, he keeps a chandler's shop, he knew nothing of the saddle or<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181105290069"/>bridle. I detained the prisoner. This is the saddle and bridle.</p>

On the 3d of May, about half past four in the morning, I saw the prisoner coming up Lower Gower-street, with a woman, the prisoner had a knot, and the woman a basket; I suspected the prisoner and watched him, I saw him go into Upper Thornaugh street, they parted, and the woman came and stood at Mr. Francis's door. The woman saw me; I went up China-street, and came back, and as soon as she saw me she went back; I went up Gower-street, and saw the woman lift the copper upon the prisoner's head; I stopped him, and took him to St. Giles's watchhouse, and then I went and acquainted Mr. Francis. I did not see him go in, or come out of the house, only take it up at the door.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 17th of April Norgan told me he had been robbed; I gave the alarm to the patrol, he found her in Essex-street, coming from the receiving-house, I knew her before; she was taken up, brought to the watchhouse, and searched, but no property found upon her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the 17th of April I was coming along Whitechapel, I was met by a young woman and the prosecutor; the young woman asked me to let her have the key of my room for an hour, which I agreed to; I returned in an hour, I saw the prosecutor sitting on the bed, he told me he had lost his watch; I said I was very sorry that they came to my room; he said he was sure that I knew nothing of it, and after he had got his clothes on he wished me good night. In about half an hour afterwards I was taken into custody. I am innocent.</p>

            , JUN On Tuesday morning about half past nine, I was in a front room in the City Road, hanging the room; I looked out of window, I saw Miller and Slop carrying these stools; I left my business and followed them towards St. John's Square; I then missed them, I waited and saw Burlett come out of the Albemarle's Head with this single stool. About half past eight we had sent Burlett to Castle Street, Long Acre, with three music stools, and when Burlett came out with this one, Slop come out with these three. When they got to Benjamin Street, Slop took the three stools to Solomon's, in Broker Row; Miller and Burlett had this single stool. I had information that they were gone to Charles Street, Long Acre; and in Long Acre I saw Slop and Miller with this single stool; I saw them offering it to one of the shops; there I lost Slop, Miller had the single stool; he went and offerered it to Mr. Brown, and shortly after Mr. Brown called Miller, and took him to Bow Street. I got an officer and took the two other prisoners at the Rising Sun, in the tap room.</p>

I saw the prisoner take one of the top pieces off; he raised it with his arms in order to put it on his shoulder, his foot slipped, and he nearly fell; he turned his head round and saw me; he threw the piece of timber down, he ran off, and I pursued him; I called to him, he made no answer. We took him the next morning, I called him up at his own house, and he went with us to Lambeth-street office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was not out of bed that morning at that time; Mr. Young and Sharp hired the use of my yard to put their tools in; when they came the next morning I conjectured they came for their tools; when they accused me I insisted upon satisfaction; I would go to the office</p>
               <p>The prisoner called one witness, who gave him a good character.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I get my living by selling fancy flowers, and it is probable by changing. I might have a bad sixpence ; it is evident that I had good money, and the reason that I kept halfpence frequently when I called at private houses I had to give them change.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hudson. Should you know the shilling and the sixpence again - A. Yes, this is the shilling and sixpence I received of her.</p>
