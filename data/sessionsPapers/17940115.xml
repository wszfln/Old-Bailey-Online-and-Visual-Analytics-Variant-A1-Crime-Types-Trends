               <p>I am a jeweller and silversmith, in the Strand, near Temple-bar. I know the prisoner at the bar, by coming to my shop the 10th of December last; I believe, it might be between the hours of three and four in the afternoon; he called at my shop to sell a piece of gold, which I have here in my hand; it weighs one ounce, six penny weights, and twelve grains, I imagine, it is worth about three pounds an ounce, from the trial that I made of it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. The prisoner says he does not understand rightly, he is a German.</p>

               <p>Essex. I examined the gold, and it appeared to me from the state in which it was, that he was a workman to somebody that worked in the gold line; I enquired how the gold came in that state, he observed, that he was a spring maker; I understanding that he means, that he was a watch spring maker, I asked him, if he was a secret spring maker for watches? he said, he was, and these were drillings; I then observed, that it was impossible for these to come from drillings, such an immese quantity as he produced to me; he then appeared very much confused, and desired the gold again; I told him, I could not comply to his request, till he gave me proper information how he came by it; I was certain he had told me a falfity; he then observed, that it was watch cases, that he had melted down; I observed, I must take charge of him, and the gold too, till such times as I had better information; he then forced his way out; an apprentice of mine stood at the door to intercept his running out; he got out; a hue and cry took place, and he was taken in the street, and brought back to my house by strangers, I suppose, in the space of a quarter of an hour, there was such a number of people, I was obliged to shut up my shop; I then took him back into the shop, and requested of him to let me know, whom he lived with, that he had thrown a great deal of guilt upon his conduct, and that he must go with me to Bow-street; I asked him his name, and where he lived? he then observed, that his name was

I put him into the hands of a constable, and sent for Mr. Delauney; and Mr. Delauney, and we, went to Bow-street, together, and the Justice desired that I would go with Mr. Delauney, and search the prisoner's lodgings. I believe, it is in the house of Mr. Atkinson, a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150004"/>carpenter. I went to this house with Bathol the constable, and Mr. Delauney; we enquired, if Mr. Wolfel lived there, and was informed he did; we searched the lodgings; we found a quantity of gold, which will be produced to you; it was in my custody till we went before the Grand Jury, when I gave it up to the custody of the constable, sealed; the constable brings it here.</p>

               <p>This is the same gold received from Mr. Essex.</p>
               <p>Essex. In looking round the room I saw some charcoal, it struck me forcibly, that there must be some crucible, or something to melt it in. I found a crucible, in which gold had been melted, and in a large chest I found some gold, melted in the same state as that he offered at first for sale. I found all the rest of the parcels that are stated in the indictment; I took them to Bow-street, and the prisoner was committed. There were a variety of parcels found, but the whole I gave to the constable sealed up, at the Grand Jury; some melted down, some in pieces, such as workmen use; the round pieces melted down, except that one he offered for sale, were in the chest; a pair of earrings were found amongst some soul clothes in a drawer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say, that he lodged in that house of Mr. Atkinson's? - He told me so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you in what apartment? - He said, it was on a ground floor, a small little room on the back of the shop; there is a shop in the front for hardware and toys; he seemed very much alarmed for his wife, as he called, a woman whom we found in the room, and his family; she came forward as his wife at Bow-street; the prisoner told us, that his wife was there, and had the key; we found the person there of the name of Sufanask Beazley. After we had examined the other places, I observed a large box, and she gave us the key to open it, and in that box, I found these parcels of gold, the lump, and some other small parcels; this little box was also in the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever collect from the prisoner, to whom all this belonged? - He never mentioned any thing, but at Bow-street, that I heard; he there observed, that he brought it from Germany.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know at all before you went to his apartment, that you should find any thing there? - I did not, I was only to go to his wife, to inform her where he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the way in which he acquainted you where he lodged? - I requested to know where he lived, that I might inform those about him of the situation he was in.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't know at all, to whom this property belonged? - Not to my knowledge, Mr. Delauney has sworn to some of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say, only whether Mr. Delauney can swear to it.</p>

             and Giles Loyer, are my partners. I live at No. 7, Crown-street, Soho; we are working goldsmiths.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you, and your two partners dwell in that house? - No, we do not all of us; the expence of the house is paid for jointly, but one of the partners lives out of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar? - Yes, he worked with us, eight months and three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you missed any of your property, your gold? - Yes, I missed gold at several times. I was sent for to Mr. Essex's, I went there, and he shewed me some gold, it was a little lump.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again? - Yes, I could not swear to it. After that, I went to Bow-street. I went with the constable and Mr. Essex, to search his lodgings, by the desire of Mr. Bond.</p>





               <p>Q. Did you see any thing, that you can swear to? - Yes, there are particulars here I can swear to; I can swear to the flat pieces, they are worth about six pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you swear to them? - By the different carats being marked on the pieces of gold, we make use of twelve carats, eighteen carats, and twenty carats; and for fear the workmen should take wrong gold to use for different works, it was my custom to write the number of carats on the pieces of gold; these are so marked, they are scratched with a file, I marked them on both sides, because, being in a hurry, the men might know at once what gold to employ; some of these pieces are here, five are marked eighteen and others twenty.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a common thing for people in your line of business to do the same way? - I do not know, it is my way.</p>
               <p>Q. Looking at these figures do you mean to swear to your figures? - I do, I can swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that these figures are your hand writing? - I do, I mean to say also that there are some other pieces that I believe are mine, but I am not so positive as the others; the ear-rings are of a pattern that I had in my house, and the prisoner had such to make, but I cannot swear to them; I often missed the gold, and complained several times that I did not know how the gold was going off.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I made the mark on the gold myself.</p>
               <p>Court to Delauney. Are you positive that you made these marks on the gold? - I am.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have come from Germany about three years, I brought the things from there, I have no witness because the time was so short I could not get them over from Germany.</p>

            Did you know him before? - Never saw him before to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him now? - O, Yes, I know him now very well, it is the outside one next to the jury; he came to me with a presence he had an acquaintance he wanted to get into the Charter-house, I took him up into my room, and shewed him the rules of the Charter-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he desired to see the rules? - I cannot say whether he did or did not; I took him up to my lodgings, my desk was in the lodging room, after he had read the rules he said he liked them very well, they were very good; then we came down to the gateway, leading to the square, and he asked me to take a walk with him, I took a walk with him, we went about a quarter of a mile together, I cannot say to what street; we went to a public house, and just at the going in at the corner Chappel met us; I don't know the name of the public house, nor what street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Chappel before? - Never saw him in my life to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know him now? - Yes, he is the middlemost, Chappel said to Nicholson have you seen any thing, yes, says he, I have seen what I am very well satisfied with, and I have got what I want; then we went into a large room, Nicholson, Chappel and I, Nicholson called for a glass of liquor, and paid for it; then Jones came into the same room with a glass of liquor in his hand, and when he came in, he said, gentlemen, I hope no offence, no, says Chappel, no offence at all, then Jones said he had come out of Coventry, he was a ribbon weaver, and his aunt was dead, and had left him four hundred pounds, and he had come up to receive it; he said she was the farmer of the workhouse, Chappel asked him what character his aunt bore? he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150007"/>afraid her character was that she was a pincher of the poor; Jones then pulled out a quantity of notes; Chappel said to

             I suppose you think nobody has got no money but you? no, says Jones, I lay you ten pounds a piece that you don't produce forty pounds a-piece in two hours, then we all came out into the street, and Chappel said that he would go to the Spotted Horse, near Moorfields. Nicholson and Chappel had asked me whether I could shew so much money? Jones was there by them at the same time, they said they could, I told them I believed I could, then we went into the street; Jones went with Chappel, and Nicholson came along with me to the Charterhouse, to my room, he went up with me to the room, and was there when I opened my desk, and I took out two notes, a twenty pound bank post bill, and a fifteen pound bank post bill; I took them out and laid them in the window myself, and he looked at them, and said they were very good.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the number of the bills? - I cannot say I did, I did not take notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any indorsement on the nores? - There was Mansfield on the back of both of them, I see my Lord Mansfield write the name on them.</p>

            After Nicholson had said they were good, what did you do then? - I took out five guineas out of a little box, to make up the forty pounds, from the same desk, Nicholson said I had better take another guinea or two, so I took another, and one guinea I had in my pocket, that made up seven guineas, then we came down and walked till we came to where there were some coaches, and Nicholson called a coach, and he ordered the coachman to drive to the Spotted Horse or Dog.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you desired him to call that coach? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you desired him to tell the coachman to drive to the Spotted Horse? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to the Spotted Horse? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the Spotted Horse what happened then? - We got out of the coach, and went into the Spotted Horse, into a back room, and there were Chappel and

             both of them, then we sat down, and Jones put down a paper of ten pounds for each that could produce the forty pounds, I shewed my forty pounds, and then I won the ten pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what was on the note that was given you? - I did not, I put it in my pocket, my own notes I put them on the table to shew them, and whether I put them in my pocket or no again with the ten pounds I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. After this what happened? - Jones wrote out four letters on the table,

            , he went and turned his back at the end of the room, and he said he would lay a guinea a-piece that he would name a letter that they were to make by the side of these, and to put under a bason. and there was a letter made, and he went and turned his back.</p>
               <p>Q. Who wrote the letter? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the letter? - I can not tell whether I did or no; the letter that was to be made was made by the side of these four, then the letters were covered, and Jones named a letter, and he did not name the right, then I, Chappel. and Nicholson, won a guinea a piece, then they would lay again, Nicholson and Chappel said we might as well have some of Jones's money as not, as he had received so much, for he was sure to lose it, both of them said so, and there was another letter made, Chappel and Nicholson said we may as well make it more, we are sure to win, and there was one sum mentioned, and then another sum mentioned, I am not certain by whom and what, and then I laid all my notes and the seven guineas on the table, then they would make a letter again,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150008"/>which Jones was to guess again, Jones did guess right the next time.</p>

            What did Nicholson and Chappel do at the time he swept them off? - They sat still; the officers then came in, and they all got up and begged and praved, and the officers said that they should go to justice, they begged and praved to be let lose, the officers said they had been doing me, and they should go to justice, then Jones, after the officers had been in some time, came to me and put some papers into my hand, a lump of papers, and I put it into my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look to see what that paper contained? - No, I took it to the justice and delivered it before the justice; one of them said that I had some money in my pocket, I don't know which it was said so, I said, I don't know that I had, except some of them had put it in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing else, with respect to the prisoners? - Yes, they found six guineas in Jones's smock pocket that is all.</p>

               <p>Q. Should you have played at this game, had you not supposed that these notes were bank notes? - No, I never was no gambler or player.</p>

            Why you gambled pretty high on this occasion? - They told me.</p>
               <p>Q. You thought you could got some of this man's money, you liked it well enough when you won, and you would have liked to have got his forty pounds well enough? - I believe my senses were taken away by what was in the drink.</p>
               <p>Q. You first of all betted a guinea on naming of the letter? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first went there you produced the forty pounds? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You put down forty pounds on the table and there it lay before you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And by that means you won a bet of ten pounds? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. He gave you the ten pounds? - He gave me a note.</p>
               <p>Q. For any thing you know to the contrary it was a ten pound note? - I never looked at the note.</p>

               <p>Q. Then however afterwards you played at this game of betting and there were four letters marked? - There were, and the prisoner Jones he went and turned his back and was to guess which of the four had been pitched upon.</p>
               <p>Q. The first bet of that fort you won, did he pay you? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And the money you expected? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now if you had ended there you would have gone away with a guinea in your pocket, you would not have thought of returning him the guinea? - No, I should suppose not.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I ask you again if you had had the good luck to have won this forty pounds bet you would have pocketed it, would not you? - Yes, I shall not speak against my conscience.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys addressed the court, that he thought the desendants from the circumstances that had come out in the evidence of the prosecutors, ought not to be put on their defence.</p>
               <p>But the court were of opinion that it was for the jury to judge whether they had not dominion over this property from the very beginning, and if they should believe, that, all that followed, was in order to get the whole into their own hands, then it would manisest a full design of sraud on their parts.</p>

               <p>I am one of the police officers at Shoreditch; I went to the Spotted Horse on Saturday, the 2d of November about one o'clock at noon, and I see the three prisoners, Jones then was by the side of the door as if he was coming out of the room, I returned out of the Spotted Horse and called Harper and Blackiter in, Jones went into the room again, whether he came out to order any thing I don't know; we went into the room and there were the three prisoners there and Mr. Cartwright, we all being in the room I told the three prisoners they must go to the magistrate, the prisoners said the man had lost no money, and begged of us not to take them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you attacked him and told him that the man had lost any money? - No, I had not, I see them do nothing, but I see there had been some kind of chalk on the table and there was some liquor in a bowl; we took them to the magistrate and sent for another officer to take care of Cartwright, we took them to the magistrate and Mr. Cartwright gave his information to Mr. Flood and Clark, I was ordered to search them, I searched Jones, and found these papers, some are notes of linen drapers, and some belong to tea shops, they were in this pocket book, I found in this canvas bag these halfpence sewed up in this piece of linen, four guineas and a half in gold, a two guinea piece, about three-pence farthing of loose money, all that gold was returned but one guineas, which I was ordered to keep. During the examination, Mr. Cartwright pulled out of his waistcoat pocket these notes I now produce, here is a fifteen pounds note and a twenty pounds note, and four or five other notes which were delivered to me with them, notes for two-pence, and false notes; in Mr. Cartwright's pocket these guineas were found, then I had orders to search Mr. Nicholson which I did, there were a guinea and a half, I believe I found in gold on him, and some notes like the others, slash notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see what these notes were that you found on Jones? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any good notes? - None. Blackiter searched Chappel.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you happen to know whose geese they were? - Not before the man owned them; I applied to the man in the morning; I enquired about the geese, whose geese they were, and this man owned them.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury; the time I was taken up, I was going to my mother's, when being within a mile of Staines, a man stopped me; on my asking him what he stopped me for, he d-n'd me, and told me, he did not know, but that I should wait till this man came up, for he heard a cry of stop thief; and when the man came up, they<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150011"/>sastened a rope from my neck to my legs, so that I was very near being choaked; I told them I had done nothing to be served so, on which, one of them stampt on my head, and told me, I had stolen some geese; which I declare is utterly false; I was taken however to Staines, and from thence I came to Newgate, where I remained till the last sessions, when I was discharged by proclamation; I then set off to go and see my mother again; about fourteen miles from Staines, two men overtook me on the road, and said, this is the man; d-n'd me, and told me, I was his prisoner, and if I did not stop, he would fire at me; I told him, I was on the King's highway, and I would not stop, unless they told me, what I had done; they said no more to me, but fired a large pistol at me, and lodged the contents of it in my legs, by which I have been lame ever since. I am entirely innocent of the crime laid to my charge, and I humbly hope, your Lordship and the Jury will think favourable of me; I humbly beg the indulgence of this honourable Court, that I may not suffer any more, for a crime that I am entirely innocent of.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. Did you carry him to gaol directly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he discharged after that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When he dropped the property, did he say any thing? - He did, he said, we molested him on the high road, that was all he said.</p>

               <p>Court to Anslett. What did he confess? - He confessed that he stood and watched, while James Westbrook and William Alexander went and took them. The next day Westbrook was taken up, and he was admitted as an evidence; he has been here to-day, and has gone back, and he will be here to-morrow by nine o'clock, if you will be so kind as to put the trial off till then.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to go back? - He could not find any body here, and so he went back.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen the geese? - I see them the day before, I see them locked up every night; the last thing I do, is to see that they are in the stable, and I lock them up; I am certain they were locked up that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you give any other account to the Jury of knowing your geese, than that of the size? - They are geese, a sort that I have bought for many years, I deal in them; and I know by the largeness of them, that they are my property. I have no other reason but that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of the others? - When William Arslett bad confessed, and I had told him, that it was a great loss to me, he told me, there were four of them turned out somewhere; in about ten days afterwards, I found them within a mile from where he directed me. I was ten days looking after them, before I found them.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you find them from Sunbury? - About a mile, they were on the common.</p>
               <p>Q. You missed these geese on the 21st, what time of the day was it? - About six the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Who lets the geese out of this stable? - I went down in the morning to seed them, and when I went down, there were but two left out of fifteen.</p>
               <p>Prisoners Counsel. What relation are you to the prisoner, John Arslett? - His father and my grandfather came of two women, but one father.</p>

               <p>Q. And the only way you have to know your property, is by their being large? - That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. No mark whatever? - I don't know that they ever had any mark; I buy them and seed them.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know your own geese from any other geese that might be passing? - I should know them.</p>

I told him, I would go with him, and I took a hammer in my hand, and a nail, to make an excuse to do a little job; we went there, and the prosecutor asked the woman, if she had any geese? she said, yes, Mr. Arslett, I have got two; I have lost some, says be; so I have heard, said she, but these are not your's, because we had not them, till after you had lost your's; with that he wished to look at them, and she opened the door, and he went down the cellar, and took up a goose, and looked at it, and said, I will swear that is my property, and he gave it to me; he said so of both; he said, they were a sort of geese that he had bought of one man for many years, and they were a different made geese than any other. So his wife desired him to take them away. I kept the geese in my possession till Sunday, the 28th, when he called on me. On the 29th, after I had dined, Sir

            What had you to do at this house? - The person at the Charing-Cross Inn gave me directions to this house, and I shewed the watchman my directions, and he told me to keep up the court, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150016"/>would follow me. I went to Mrs. Hannow to enquire for lodgings.</p>

               <p>Q. What were the things in? - In two bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was it? - Between ten and eleven at night; after I got into the lodgings, the prisoner, he came and pulled me from the window, and swore that he would be the death of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts in the house did you put the bundles? - I paid the woman, Mrs. Hannow, a shilling for my night's lodging; and I asked her, if I was to shut the room door, she said, no, there were two or three other girls to come into the same room. I went into the room with a candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by yourself there? - Yes. I was undressed, and in bed, when they robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you put the bundles? - By the bedside; after that a young woman came up, and took my bundles from my bedside, and took my pockets from under my head, and took a guinea out of my pocket; there were two more women with her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any man with them? - Yes, that gentleman that stands at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then there were three girls in the room, and the prisoner at the bar? - Yes. I asked them, what they were doing with my pockets, and they said, d-n your eyes, you b-ch, I will be the death of you, he said, if I would not hold my d-nation tongue, he would put a handkerchief down my throat; after that, the prisoner at the bar, and the women pushed me down stairs, and throwed a pail of water over me. I had put my petticoat on, and I had my gown in my hand, and I throwed that over me, and I saw the same watchman that recommended me to the lodging, I asked him which was the way to the watch-house, he stood at the end of the court; I asked him, if he would be so kind as to recommend me to the watch-house? he said, yes, keep straight down; I kept straight down, and got to the watch-house, and I saw some gentlemen there; an old gentleman, the officer of the night, I desired them to go with me to Charing-Cross; I told them what had happened, he went with me to the Charing-Cross Inn, and they were not up.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you go to the Charing-Cross Inn for? - The constable went to know, whether there was such a person as me there the overnight; they did not get up, we went again in the morning. I staid with them in the watch-house till the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You talked of two bundles at first. Do you know what became of these bundles? - The girls took them away.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen the girls since? - No, only one, I think I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see the man again? - I did not see him till four or five days after that.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to see him again? - The gentleman, the officer, brought him over.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went to bed, of course, you had a candle in your room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put that candle out? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that candle out when the girls came into the room? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any light when they came in? - There was a light that came in from a window, the other side of the way.</p>

               <p>Q. You say there was no light in the room, only a light that came from the opposite side of the way. Are you very sure, that that light was sufficient to distinguish his face perfectly? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the things taken out of your pocket, besides the guinea? - A direction, that I was to find out my aunt by, and a pocket handkerchief.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am one of the beadles of the parish of St. Martin's in the fields. On the 2d of January, on Thursday morning, two officers belonging to Westminster brought the prosecutrix to me, and informed me in what manner she had been robbed, and where; in consequence of that I took her into Johnson's-court, she pointed out the court and shewed me the second house, that is where Mrs. Hannow lives; there are three houses. I went into almost every room of the three houses, she pointed out the house with a little hesitation whether it was the first or second, I went into all the three on that side; she confined herself to one side, and I took her into all the rooms and shewed her all the women that were at home then; she did not seem to know any of their faces at all; I came back again to the first house, and went up again to the two pair of stairs room in the first house, and then she signified that was the room she was robbed in; we had been in the house before; the first time she signified that was the room but not to a certainty; then we went back, and she fignified that was the room; I then asked her respecting to the man; she then told me that it was a man with a round hat, and described the man; it exactly corresponded with the description she has given now; I went and made an inquiration after the prisoner at the bar, from the description she had given me, I had seen the prisoner in that sort of dress many times, I did not know that he lived in Johnson's-court; in consequence of making an coquiry after him in the forenoon and did not find him, in the afternoon I went into Chandos-street, into a public house, the prisoner came to me and told me that he had heard that there was an information against him for a very disagreeable circumstance, and told me that in consequence of that he would surrender himself up; in consequence of that, between six and seven in the evening I took him before Mr. Addington, the prosecutrix not being there that night, we were not examined, but were ordered to attend on the Monday following, at the re-examination, this was on Thursday night the day after the robbery.</p>


               <p>Q. Then on Monday following he did attend? - Yes, and the prosecutrix saw him, and swore that was the man, in consequence of that he was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the man lodge, do you know? - Upon my word I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ask him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you search him? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you have found nothing at all about him? - I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find any of the things that this woman lost? - I have not, I have made first enquiry at several pawnbrokers.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the prisoner at the bar? - I understand him to be belonging to a recruiting party.</p>
               <p>

            What was the prisoner's dress on Monday when he appeared? - He was ordered by justice Addington to attend in the dress he usually wore at Chating Cross, and he did attend in that dress.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed when he came and told you that he heard there was an information against him? - Much as he is now with a great blue coat over his red jacket.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. You do not mean to say that he had altered his dress, he wore his blue coat over his other being cold weather? - Nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. When she came to you she described the man having such regimentals? - She did.</p>
               <p>Q. You knowing and seeing him in these regimentals, you thought he was the man? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find him? - I went to some acquaintance of his and said that I wanted him.</p>

               <p>Q. In consequence of which, as soon as he reasonably could he found you out? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. And then he desired to go before a magistrate, and you took him to Bow-street? - Exactly so.</p>

               <p>Q. When he went there he was dressed as usual? - I think he was.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you, at different times, seen the other persons that were in recruiting parties? - He always dressed different from the rest; the jacket he wore was more smart; they did nor all wear a red coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any other of the recruiting parties dressed in red besides this man? In short how came you to suspect this man? - By the prosecutrix telling me that he wore a feather in his hat, and a jacket trimmed in a different manner to what soldiers jackets generally are; I don't know that she described it as a jacket.</p>

After that the headle came to my house to enquire for him, and I asked what was the matter? he said he did not know. When Barrett came in, I said to him, Barrett, the beadle has been here, there is something the matter; says he, I will go down to Charing Cross and see what it is, and he went away, and he came back again in the course of three quarters of an hour; this might be about twelve o'clock, and he told me that he had heard some scandalous affair of him, and he wanted to know where the officer was to be found; then I being ill, my wife went with him where the officer was.</p>

            . On the 19th of December, Thursday, we lost the sugar, I was landing away some sugar about six o'clock in the evening, from Fresh wharf, I was very near done, I had rolled two hogsheads in the gateway to make room for the carts to go down; I was called by my brother to look, he said he had found a hogshead that was plundered with the head out. My brother's name is James Yates; I had not stayed on the whars above the space of five minutes before this man, Brightwell, brought the prisoner down with his apron full of sugar, from Cox's key; I looked at the hogshead and there was half the head out, and a deal of sugar out, and lay about, I took the sugar and compared it with that in the hogshead, and it appears from what I know of sugar, to be of the same quality; there was none other on the key that had their heads open, I looked them all over, there were different forts of sugar on the key.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say with certainty that any was missing from the hogshead? - Yes, I can say there was a good deal missing at that time, I know that the hogshead was full, I had seen it a tight head on half an hour before.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that you saw the prisoner after you had seen the hogshead open? - About five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make the discovery that the sugar was gone before the prisoner was brought to you? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it that you made the discovery that the sugar was gone before it was brought to you? - Not five minutes.</p>

               <p>Court to Brightwell. How far was the prisoner from the hogshead that had the head taken off? - About forty or fifty yards, not more.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The hogsheads were in one gateway, and I was going up another, therefore it must be more than fifty yards.</p>
               <p>Court to Yates. What might be the value of the sugar found on him? - About six shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think that the quantity found there was all that was missing? - I think it was with the rest that lay on the ground, which I did not pick up, because it being dirty it would spoil the rest.</p>

               <p>Q. How soon were they produced to you? - In the course of a minute, as soon as I took the prisoner. We call them shoes, but the proper name is channel pumps.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with them? - The constable had them.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there any buildings over it? - No, it was one room only, in that room is my bed and shop; the house was untiled, there was neither door nor window broke.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it was untiled? - About five or six tiles were taken off.</p>
               <p>Q. How high may these tiles be from the ground? - Seven or eight feet from the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this house is a mere shed? - It is built as one.</p>

When had you seen the two guineas before? - I saw them before I went out that very day; I had powder and pomatum keeping in that same box, I put it in that same night; the money was laying open in a till in the top of the box, there was nothing that I missed there; there was a trunk broke open, and the clothes taken out of that trunk, they took out a hat, a green cloth coat, four cotton jackets, two waistcoats; one was a striped silk and cotton, and the other was a kerseymere, two pair of nankeen breeches, one pair of kerseymere breeches; there was another place in which my things lay besides, neither in this box or trunk, in an open box, from thence they took eight pair of silk and cotton stockings, four pair of cotton stockings only, and three shirts; my hat was worth about ten and six pence, the green coat forty shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do in consequence of finding your house broke open? - I was very much frightened indeed, and did nothing, but the next morning when I heard the man was in custody, I went with them before the justice.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see Griffiths lay hold of him? - No, it was dark, he had hold of him, as soon as I got to him, we were apart, the prisoner he said directly he knew that he should be hanged.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear Griffiths charge him with any thing when he said that? - No, he only said to me, Sims, I have got him, and then the prisoner made answer he knew he should be hanged; then I asked him where he got the things?</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any promise to him before you put that question to him? - None at all; he said he got them from Mr. Mitchell's, of Clapton, I asked him how he got in? he told me he took some of the tiles off from the house, and got in; I asked him if any body was with him? he declared there was nobody with him but himself; I asked him where he had been all that time? he told me that he went home to his lodgings; I asked him where his lodgings were? he told me he lodged at the Old Mermaid in Hackney, that he had just got out of bed, and come there to the stack; Griffiths and I took him to our watch-house, I sent Griffiths up to fetch Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Mitchell came to the watch-house, and described the house broke open, just as the prisoner had told me he had done, and owned his property.</p>

               <p>I am one of the patroles belonging to Hackney parish; I was with Samuel Sims on the evening of Sunday the 6th, accordingly I was just going out, Sims came down to the watch-house, and asked me to go along with him to this stack, to see who came after these things. We waited there till a quarter past six in the morning, at a quarter past six the prisoner at the bar came, and I laid hold of him, accordingly as I laid hold of him he cried I am dead, I am hung; accordingly he told me where he brought these things from, that he had broke open into Mr. Mitchell's house, that he took the tiles off from the house; the man is a bricklayer's labourer in Clapton, he works for one Mr. Peel, who lives near where Mr. Mitchell lives; he said that he got down from the roof of the house, and after he got down, he broke open two boxes, they were both locked; it was much about ten o'clock in the evening that he got those things out, and brought them down, and laid them down behind the hay stack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any promise to him if he would tell you where he got them? - No, he confessed, I suppose through the fright, and cried and begged of me several times to let him go, he seemed very much alarmed, he told me he was then coming with an intention to take these things away, that he had rather overlaid himself, or else he thought of being sooner. We took him down to the watch-house, and there we searched him, but we found no property at all belonging to Mr. Mitchell.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not find the two guineas? - No, we did not find any thing of the money.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner when he was taken up? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more about it than a child unborn; I got up about half past six, to go to work as usual. I lodge at Hackney, at the Mermaid; I had to go to work at Lee-bridge, as I was going to work I went up to the hay stack to case myself, and the watchman jumped out and catched hold of me, and said O, you are coming for your prey, are you, and they shook me, and hustled me, and then they took me into the public house, and had a pot of purl, and they made me quite stupid, and every thing they said, I said yes to, then they took me into the watch-house, and then they brought me some gin.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did they give you the purl? - At the watch-house, the purl and the gin, after I had been in the watch-house about half an hour; I stopped there, the constable and the watchman came, and the constable took me to his house, and had a glass of gin, and they gave me some breakfast; and then the men came and said that whatever they said I must stand to; I was quite stupified, I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Court to Griffiths. Did he make this confession before he drank this purl, or after? - Before he got to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Jury to Sims. Did the bundle remain under the hay stack the whole night? - No, it was taken to the watch-house by me about twelve o'clock; from that time to this it has been in my custody.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you say any thing to him to encourage him to this conversation? - No, as I was going along further with him I met the gentleman that had been robbed, he told me he had lost two cheeses, and he could swear to it.</p>

On Friday, by enquiry, we learned where Frazier lived, we went to his house about eleven o'clock in the day, between eleven and one, I will not be positive just to the time; we knocked at the door; we tapped again at the door; she told us she would not open it, that the person belonging to the house was out, was gone to the London Infirmary, the woman belonging to the house was; I immediately lifted up the parlour window. Mr. Griffiths, who is a brother officer, he got in at the window<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150030"/>and I got in after him; the door was fastened, which they refused to open, Mr. Griffiths going up stairs, meets Frazier in the passage, as he was going along the passage to go up stairs, Frazier came to the door as I stood at the door; the door was not open, but I was inside; I asked him what his name was? he told me his name was Hall; he is the one nearest the jury; I told him his name was not Hall; I asked him if he kept the house? and he said, yes; then says I, your name is Frazier; and says he, what if it is Frazier? I told him he was wanted; I did not tell him for what. While Mr. Griffiths was up stairs I opened the door and let Mr. Coombes in.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you let him in after you saw Frazier or before? - After. We then went into the parlour where this woman was, the back part of the parlour was dark, in which there was a bed on a turn up bedstead; Muslin was standing between the bed and the wall, standing up as right as he could stand, then it gave me suspicion that Collyer was there; I immediately turns down the bed, and Collyer was lying on his back on the bed, the house was searched afterwards but not by me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There was no butter found or butter tub? - No.</p>

On the 18th of December I received information of a man being robbed near Stepney; on the 19th I took John Clarke; on the 20th I, in company with Taplin and Coombes, took Frazier, Collver, and Muslin, at No. 1, Dean-street, East Smithfield; I knocked at the door, they refused to open the door; Taplin listed up the window and I went in, Taplin followed me; I went into the passage to go to the stairs, and I met Frazier, Taplin asked him his name; I did not justly hear what he said, I was going up stairs; I went up two pair of stairs, there sat a woman, I asked if any body else was there? she said no; I asked for the key of the one pair of stairs room; she said she had not got it; I came down and called for the key of the one pair of stairs room; it was brought me by Coombes; I unlocked the door and went in, but no person was there; I came down and went into the room, I went in first; Frazier was with Taplin in the room; after being a few minutes in the room, I believe it was Coombes, saw Muslin standing by the bed side, Taplin went to the bed to examine whether Collyer was there, and he found him in the bed with the bed turned up.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You did not find any sirkin or butter? - No.</p>

            , I cannot rightly tell you the day of the month, it is about a month ago; we were going up Whitechapel, in going up Whitechapel we saw a little boy with two five shilling papers of halfpence, ten shillings worth; immediately Muslin said let us follow the boy, we followed the boy as far as Union-street, Whitechapel; then we snatched the ten shillings worth of halfpence out of the boy's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this business of Hennen's? - We took the ten shillings-worth of halfpence from this boy and went up to Bow Common-fields, and they gave me three shillings and four pence; we went round and we met with John Frazier in Bethnal Green-road, then we went to a public house to have something to drink, going up White Horse-lane we met with this young man with the butter; this was about five or six o'clock in the evening; immediately when we were going along there I saw the man's butter fall down; as soon as the butter fell down I saw the man fall down.</p>

            Who knocked him down? - I cannot rightly say who knocked him down, it was one of the three; but the people running after them they all run spread on to Stepney Church-yard, and I ran, when I came to Stepney Church yard they came up to me; I never asked them whether they had got the butter or any thing.

               <p>Q. Where did it lay when they took it? - It lay in the road.</p>

            They gave it you, why? - I don't know, because they got it in that way, and I was with them, one of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had not you a right then to part of the butter, or what the butter would fetch? - I never asked them about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What past when you got to the Church-yard? - They went right up Ratcliff Highway.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the prisoners live? - I don't know where they live; I know where one of them lived, I don't know where the other two lived, Richard Collyer lived in Thrawl-street, Spitalfields.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does the others live? - I never heard; I never was in their company much.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see either of these prisoners at No. 1, Dean-street? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. How many public houses had you been in from the morning to the time this matter happened? - One.</p>
               <p>Q. There were a number of people about at the time this robbery took place? - There was nobody about but ourselves.</p>
               <p>Q. Where there no boys about? - Not that I saw; that I swear positive.</p>
               <p>Q. If these three men are convicted there will be three times forty pounds reward? - I cannot tell I do assure you.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Frazier. I keep this house No. 1, Dean-street, East Smithfield; I let it out in different apartments, and each lodger wants a key to the street door to let themselves in and out; two or three of these keys I brought from my father's and friends, and the rest I bought at an old iron shop to try if they would sit the lock of the door. I have witnesses to call that are sufficient to prove that these witnesses have perjured themselves every one.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Muslin. As I was going down Whitechapel, I met with Collyer and Clarke, and they pressed me to go with them to get a bag of saw dust. Coming down Bethnall-green-road we saw a bullock, and a quantity of people about trying to put a halter about its neck, and we stopped there some time, and after that we had something to drink; coming up White Horse-lane we met this man with the butter, we were very much in liquor, we had stopped at the Rising Sun, in Bethnall-green, and had several pots of beer and other liquor in the public house; coming up this lane we ran against this lad, not thinking any harm, and came our ways home directly.</p>

The prisoner Clarke has worked for me about three years; he keeps company with my sister; he came to me that morning to go and get a sack of dust, he asked me to go with him; accordingly I went with him, and we could not get any, and we all went round Bethnall-green; he had a sack when Muslin met us, I don't know what he wanted the saw dust for then we met with this bullock that was wild, there were a great many people about it, and some drovers and people with ropes, trying to tie him, and he would not be tied he was so wild, and there were several more young fellows that we knew, and we went into a public house and had something to drink, after that the drovers brought some more beasts to go along with this bullock to take it away, and they took it up towards the Rising Sun, in Bethnall-green-road, and there we stayed drinking all the day, that he cannot deny, till it was pretty nigh dusk; then we pursued right down to go down to the Globe, in Stepney, crossing there from Whitechapel we met this young man with the butter, in the White Horse-lane, somebody, one of us, happened to shove this lad, and he began fighting with him, I believe it was Clarke, and there were a great many people came round about, and we all ran away and left the butter behind us, and Clarke cannot say that we went with an intent to rob the man of the butter; he was never out of our company from that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150035"/>time till nine o'clock that we came home.</p>

            Then have not you spoke every thing on oath? why did you call him brother? - Because he is out asked at Hampstead Church to my husband's sister.</p>
               <p>Q. To Mr. Parrott. Was you with Mrs. Hopkins at any time that she was robbed? - A very little while. On the 8th of January, Wednesday night, I was just returning from her, after I had got her a lodging, I had not got above ten yards, I stopped to make water, before I had done I heard this woman cry out for assistance, she was robbed, I went up<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150038"/>to her, and she laid down in the dirt, in the kennel of the street; says I, which way is he gone? I did not stop to pick her up, I ran along the street after the man, and I saw the watchman, and I asked him, if he saw any man run past there with a cloak? he said, there was a man just gone before; I went after him, and caught hold of him by the collar; says I, stop my friend, you have got something there that does not belong to you; he makes answer immediately, and says, I have got nothing here belonging to you; I told him, if he had not got any thing belonging to me, he had got something belonging to somebody else, that did not belong to him; and the watchman came out to assist, and we found the cloak underneath his coat; it was a white cloak; the watchman and I took him to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. You never lost fight of him, after you took him with the cloak? - No; the prisoner is the man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you say at the justice's, you was in the house when your sister called you? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Jury. How far was he when you took him from where your sister was robbed? - About three hundred yards; he was ten yards from where he lodged himself, when I took him; the people told me that, where he lodged.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Hopkins. What is the value of this cloak? - The cloak it is not worth any thing, I don't care what value you put on it; it is worth eighteen pence.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I produce the cloak; I am a watchman. I was at the corner of Bucklet-street, St. Giles's; I was standing in my box fixing my candle in the lanthorn; I heard a woman calling out, Adam! Adam! It is a noisy troublesome place with women there, I took very little notice of that; a man came up to me, I thought he had something under his coat; he walked very unconcerned by the box, in a minute afterwards, this young fellow ran by the box; he said, watchman, did you see a man go by here? I told him, yes; says I, he is just before you; and I bounces out of the box, he went along, and in a very little time, he stopped that man there, and I came up to him, and it was that man there, I knew the man; I found the cloak under his coat, on the left-hand side, hid; I took it from him, and I took him to the watch-house. This is the cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Who got up to the man first, you or Parrott? - Parrott was the man that caught him first, I had to come out of the box, so he was more at liberty, than I was; I am sure that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any woman? - I saw no woman there, but this woman that came up, and went with us, and gave charge of the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she in the presence of the prisoner say any thing about the cloak? - She said, that was the man that robbed her of her cloak, and used her ill; she was all over mud and dirt, at the same time, very dirty. I have kept the cloak in my possission ever since.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hopkins. This is my cloak.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That same night a man ran past me, as I was making water, and said, balloo! and he immediately dropped the cloak, and I picked it up; I walked past the watchman with it, and I said to the watchman, why did not you stop him, when you saw him? I was not two yards from his box, when he stopped me. I have sent two letters to a man, that I served my time to; he is not here. I served my time to a butcher.</p>

               <p>On the 3d of August last I was out about my business, when I came home at noon, my wife had been serving a person,(a gentleman that appeared to be) with some black silk. I am a <rs id="t17940115-16-viclabel82" type="occupation">silk manufacturer</rs>

I came home just as she had finished serving him, and I packed up the goods; I found the person in the shop when I came home, and the person offered me a note. The prisoner at the bar is very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150040"/>much like the man, I cannot swear to him, but he is very much like the person, my wife served him chiesly; he offered me the note in payment for the goods, to take one pound, nineteen shillings out of it, I took the note, and gave the change; I supposed it to be a good note; I took it to the banker's for payment about an hour and a half after, to Lloyd, Taylor, and Co. they said, they hoped, I had not given value for it, for it was not worth a halfpenny.</p>

I sent our young man with it, and I heard no more of it, till the next morning, when I was looking over some bills, I observed two ten pounds notes; I asked my young man where they came from. I saw the prisoner about eight or ten days afterwards, he wished then to pay for the silk, and he said, I could do nothing but arrest him. I thought the boy would find him again; I saw him in my own compting-house in custody, coming home one morning.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You sent the boy with the bill of parcels made out, in which the prisoner was made debtor to you? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not entered this in your book, and made the prisoner debtor? - I have entered it in our memorandum-book, which I do on all occasions; it has gone regularly through the journal, and through the ledger to his debit.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he stands debtor in your books now to that amount? You made him your debtor, as you would any other customer? - Surely.</p>

I answered, yes; he desired me to go on, and he should overtake me, which he did in two minutes after; he took me to his lodgings; he knocked at the door, and it was opened by the woman that keeps the house, and he took me into the front room; I gave him the bill of parcels; he took his pencil, and proved it to be right; and then gave me two bills, ten pounds each, on Taylor, Lloyd, Bowman, and Co. I took them home, and Mr. Wilson enquired the next morning of whom I received them, I told him. The amount of the bill being twelve pounds, ten shillings, I informed the prisoner, I had not cash enough to give him change about me, he then said, he wanted more goods, and he would call the next day, and look them out, when he would take the change; I saw no more of the prisoner from that time, till the 21st of the same month; when I saw him in Fleet-street, and pursued him, he ran away as fast as he could, and me after him; and by the assistance of another man, who met him, and stopped him, I got up to him; the prisoner seemed much confused, but after recovering himself, he said, the best way I could do, was to go with him, and he would get me the whole of the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him, that led him to say this? - The moment that he recovered himself, I looked at him, and he said, the best thing I could do, was to go with him, and he would give me the whole of my money. I told him, I could not confidently do any such thing; he then said, where do you mean to take me? I told him, he should go to Bread-street, if he chose, to Mr. Wilson's; he agreed, and we went; and Mr. Wilson came home a short time after he had been there, and then I went with the prisoner to Guildhall, and Mr. Wilson came there; he was examined before the magistrate, and I gave the evidence that I now give, and he was committed.</p>
               <p>Court to Wilson. Have you those two notes? - I have, these are the notes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are these the notes you received of the young man? - They are the same.</p>
               <p>Clarke. These are the notes I received of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with these notes? - The morning after I received them, I presented them to Taylor, Lloyd, Bowman, and Co. they informed me, they were not worth any thing; I then went back to Pimlico, in hopes to find the prisoner at his lodgings; I did not find him there; the person who keeps the house is now in court, who will tell you more of the subject about that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You delivered him the goods with the bill of parcels? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you enter the goods in a book? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you do it after you returned from Pimlico? - I entered them before I carried them.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand they were entered into three books, first of all, in the memorandum book, afterwards in the journal, and then in the ledger? - I entered them in the memorandum book myself.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the delivery of the goods, did you enter them into the ledger? - I did not enter them into the ledger, we have a clerk for that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after this transaction, that they were put into the ledger? - I cannot tell, I have not seen it in the ledger yet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Wilson. When is your goods entered in the ledger? - At the end<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150042"/>of the month, it is entered in the ledger regularly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys here objected to the making of this a felony, as the prosecutor had considered him on his books in the light of a debtor. The court was of opinion, that it would be proper for the Jury to decide upon the intention of the prisoner, and alio, whether Mr. Wilson at the time he sold these goods, meant to give him credit. And afterwards to reserve the case for the consideration of the Judges.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before? - No. He liked them very well, and he thought he should like to have them; he asked me the number of my door, and the name of the street, I told him, it was No. 6, Arabella-row; and he told me, that he was come from the country, and he had a portmanteau coming from the country; and he went away, and he told me, he would call again; he never gave me his address; in the afternoon, between five and six, he called again; he came about ten in the morning to bargain for the lodgings; between five and six, he told me he had ordered his portmanteau to come there, and that he would have my lodgings; I told him, I did not know what to do about taking parcels in, till the lodgings were taken, and I had not his address yet, to enquire about him; he said, he would walk about, and take the portmanteau himslef; and he went out about six o'clock; he came again, and knocked at the door, and a young man with him, he had not got the portmanteau, and when he knocked at the door, I opened the door, and he walked into the front parlour, and the young man with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any portmanteau then? - No, nothing but the small parcel that the young man had by his side. Then I did not like his behaviour; I went to the bed room adjoining, and looked in, and then went and stood at the door, not liking his taking that liberty before he was a lodger. I stood at the door till the other man came out, the young man came out, and said, you are very pleasant, and went away; and the prisoner stood at the door, to see him out of sight; I said to him, have you got your portmanteau? no, says he, I have not, tis not come, I have given eighteen-pence to a man to bring it; I will go, and see, why it does not come; and he turned back again, and went into the parlour, and took this small parcel, and went away, and I never saw him afterwards.</p>

I said because I cannot; and I had been gone about two dozen yards to the best of my knowledge, and I heard the man cry out for the watch; I looked back but I did not go my further and I saw the man, and there were three men run past me in a very great hurry, and I was come to my own home and I saw the prosecutor talking to the watchman, I made over to him. I went to cross over to speak to him, the watchman made for answer that he saw this young woman in your company, and he said he would take me into custody, and I went along with him to the watch-house, the prosecutor said that he would give no charge of me, and I knew nothing of the robbery, but the watchman said that he should take me untill he found the young men, I was put into the watch-house all night long.</p>

               <p>On the 13th of December last, I was awakened by my wife, saying, what is the matter? I made answer, and said to her, I thought it sounded like a bottle, or a pot, or a kettle. I sat up in my bed, and I thought I heard the cracking of glass, as though somebody trod on it; I got up in the bed, and stood by the bedside, and undrewed the curtain; I looked out of the back window, and there I saw a man standing in the yard, which is adjoining to the room where I sleep, which I believe to be the prisoner; I says to my wife, there is somebody broke into the wash-house, and she got up and looked out, and knocked against the window; and I ran to the front door to the street, and as soon as I got that open, I saw the prisoner; he came running out of the passage, which is joining to my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Does that passage communicate with the yard? - Yes, there is a wall about eight feet high.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any communication without getting over the wall? - No. There is a door, but it was fastened. The prisoner ran up the street towards White-cross-street, and I cried out, stop thief! as soon as I gave the alarm, I saw two watchmen run to meet him; the prisoner then turned up an area, a passage which is joining a baker's shop; then I lost sight of him; but I heard the watchman say. I have him; the watchman told me afterwards, that he jumped over three walls.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him in the watchmen's custody? - No, I did not, till afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon afterwards? - It might be the value of two or three minutes, I cannot say to a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he any thing in his posseffion? - Nothing but a knife.</p>

               <p>Q. You say, you was waked by your wife on the 13th of December, what time of the night was that? - Between twelve and one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you discover any thing particular in your house? - Yes, they broke a pane of glass, and unfastened a window, and pushed it back, and they had got in.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150052"/>Q. Who had fastened that window the night before you went to bed? - My wife, she is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her fasten it? - I did not; I heard her say, she would fasten it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any thing there? - Nothing of my own.</p>
               <p>Q. And when the prisoner was taken, there was nothing found on him? - No, nothing, only a knife.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, you never saw the prisoner? - Never. I know nothing of him.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you look, to see if anybody had been in the house? - Not till my husband said there was somebody breaking in, or broke in; but when I approached the window, there I saw a man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the mark of any window being opened? - Not at that time, till I went round, and went and looked to the kitchen. The bar that I put to fasten the window after ten o'clock, I found in the yard, and a pane of glass broke, to shove the window back; and the window was shoved back, there were two of them; one made two attempts to scale the walls before we caught him.</p>
               <p>Q. When you looked out of window, and saw the man in the yard, can you tell, whether the prisoner was one? - I really cannot. I did not see his face, they were shortish men in brownish clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see the prisoner? - To my knowledge, I never saw him, till I saw him before the justice in Worship-street.</p>

I had not stood long with him talking, before I heard the cry of, watch! I saw the prisoner that is at the bar, advancing towards us; I said to my fellow servant, he cannot get away, there is no thoroughfare. My fellow servant took him in a kind of an area, under a knife board; my fellow servant got him up by his hands, and I got hold of his legs, and we lifted him up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing on him? - No. We took him to the watch-house, and from there to Clerken well.</p>

               <p>I was tenant at that time to Mr. Hanney; the kitchen belonged to me, and part of the house besides. I rented the first story up stairs; the kitchen is in a line with the parlour. The night the robbery is slated to be committed, I lost the things mentioned in the indictment; they were removed from the kitchen into the yard through the window; they have been in my custody ever since; the magistrate permitted me to use the children's clothes, and some things that we wanted; the articles were marked prior to the robbery with the initials of my name. These things were moved from the horse in the kitchen, through the window into the yard.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had left them there? - My servants and my wife; they had hung them up about the kitchen as they usually do. I do not know of myself that they were there, but Mrs. Hanney do.</p>

            , and Thomas Stiles. On the 26th of December, Thursday, the day after Christmas-day, we lost the property from the warehouse; the prisoner had worked with us about two months; he was a <rs id="t17940115-20-deflabel105" type="occupation">daily servant</rs>
                  <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                        targets="t17940115-20-defend332 t17940115-20-deflabel105"/>, he was not employed that morning, he had worked for two months before that day; he came to the counting-house about eleven o'clock in the morning, I asked him, if that was the first of his appearance on that day? he said, it was, he had just come down. I asked him, if he was come to work; he said, if we wanted him, he would work. I told him, we had men sufficient, we did not want him; and then I asked him, what his business was, what he wanted there? he said, he would be obliged to me for the keys of the warehouse, No. 22. I asked him, what he wanted? he said, that he wanted his waistcoat, that he had left the over-night,(the day before Christmas day) he wanted to send it into the country with some other of his things to wash; I told him to get the key, and get his waistcoat. I was busy with some gentlemen in the counting-house at that moment. I had thoughts of going after him, but the postman came, and hindered me; within five minutes, while I was paying the postman for some letters, he came back with the keys in his hand. I asked him, if he had got his waistcoat? he said, no, he could not find it; at the moment, as I was standing at the door way of the counting-house, he twisted by me to hang up the keys; and I observed his great coat pockets very heavy, and I says to him, what is that you have got in your pockets? he said, it was coffee that was his own, that another man had swept up the floor the preceding day, and that, he said, he did not want, and he said, he might take it; I made answer, that it was a shame any man should go out of the yard in his situation, for his great coat pockets were so apparently heavy both of them; while I was speaking this to him, he was going out of the yard as fast as he could; I called to him and told him, I wanted to speak to him; he said, he was coming presently, but still hastened out of the yard as fast as he could; I told him, I must see him then, but still he hastened out of the yard as fast as he could; then I ran after him, and caught him in Hand Court,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150054"/>about two hundred yards from the counting-house, as soon as I laid hold of him, he begged I would not make a piece of work, there was nothing on him that would hurt me. I told him, whatever he, had, I would insist to see it. When he got under the gate-way, he confessed, that he had property that was not his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Before this, had you told him, it would be better for him to confess? - I only insisted on seeing what was in his pockets. I led him down by his collar. The first word he said, was, that he had done what he ought not to have done; then he confessed, that he had property that was not his own on him. When I got him to the counting-house, I took him up stairs, Mr. Stiles was there present; we asked him, what he had got? he said, he had got cochineal; we asked him, where he got it? he said out of the warehouse, (22) and then he begged for mercy on his knees.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of this cochineal? - Four pounds; the cochineal is in court, there is upwards of eight pounds of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to this warehouse to see if any were missing? - As soon as we had taken him into custody, we went to this warehouse, and there we found a bag of cochineal torn, and a great deal laying on the floor; I suppose, ten or fourteen pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. From the hole that was torn, could he have taken that quantity, that he had about him? - Certainly. The whole would have run out, if it had not been for other bags that were by it, that it ran between. He was taken before a magistrate, and committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing else? - He intimated, that he did it by the advice of another person; whether it may be proper to mention that, I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. What business was he in your house? - He was a labourer, he had frequently been employed in coopering.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted, till this time, you had a good opinion of this young man, or else you would not have employed him? - Why, we took him without a character.</p>
               <p>Q. When you had seen him, and given him the keys, he returned back in about five minutes? - I think it was so.</p>
               <p>Q. He brought the keys back to the very house where you was? - He did, and hung them up close to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a very natural thing for a man to do, that had been committing felony? now about this confession, finding yourself robbed, and suspecting the prisoner had been the person, you was a little displeased with him, will you be kind enough to tell the court whether you did not say to him something like this, I know you have robbed me, tell me the truth? - I did not conceive he had robbed me till I saw his pockets so full, the words I used were, I insisted upon seeing what was in his pockets.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you tell him it would be better for him for to let you see what was in his pockets? - I did not, I had a great opinion of the young man we had intimations that he was not trust worthy, I had suspicions when I gave him the keys, and I meant to be after him.</p>
               <p>Q. When he came back you took him up, and he downed on his knees and prayed for mercy? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did you make him? - I told him the circumstance he had been guilty of could not plead much for mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Then it was after that, that he pulled out of his pocket a bag of cochineal? - No, it was not, he said, this I have done by the advice of another, or to oblige another.</p>
               <p>Q. How many bags of cochineal might you have in this warehouse? - Probably between twenty and thirty.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150055"/>Q. How long before had you been in the warehouse, No. 22,? - The eve before Christmas day we had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you yourself been in that warehouse? - It is a particular warehouse, we are in it two or three times, a day I might not have been in the warehouse myself for two or three days.</p>
               <p>Q. I am sure that you don't mean to equivocate, you tell us that you might not have been in the warehouse for two or three days, before you said you were in it on Christmas eve? - When I say this I mean to include myself, partners, and some of the leading men in the warehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you always keep the keys of the warehouse yourself? - They are always in the counting house, in an iron chest.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take on yourself to say how many persons might have gone into the warehouse when you might not have gone in yourself for two or three days? - I cannot.</p>
               <p>Q. If you might not have been in for two or three days, then for these two or three days you could not be acquainted with the state of the cochineal? - I was not.</p>
               <p>

            Then if any other person had been in this warehouse in the two or three days that you was not there, you could not have known any thing about it? - I could not.</p>

Will you take upon yourself to say that the cochineal in your warehouse was distinguishable from what is in other warehouses? do you mean to swear to that cochineal being your property from any mark that you have? - I certainly will swear to the cochineal being our property.</p>
               <p>Court. Was there any other bag open besides this one? - No, none other.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was there last was there any bag open? - No, not to my knowledge.</p>

The cochineal was put in a paper bag, and the seam sewed up, I believe I took possession of it, I put it under lock and key, which key I have always had.</p>

               <p>I am a constable of Dowgate ward; I was sent for to take care of this man, I saw cochineal taken out of his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Jenkins. Why were there two parcels? - This that Wainwright speaks of was taken from his body at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Wainwright. I did not see the parcel taken from his pocket, but this other parcel I took from him myself, I emptied the other pocket in the Mansion-house.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether that parcel that is sealed up is the parcel that was taken from him in the counting house? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought that to the Lord Mayor? - Mr. Pearson; when I took<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150056"/>him to the Mansion House I stroked him down, and in his great coat pocket I found something heavy in his pocket; I asked him what he had got there? he rather objected to my seeing, but I examined him, and I found his coat pockets pretty near full of cochineal.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with that second parcel? - That was sealed up, and given into Mr. Hanson's counting house, to Mr. Jennings.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearson. Is that the same sort of cochineal that was in the bag? - I have a sample here from the bag, and from the best of my judgment it is the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Perhaps as you are a warehouse-keeper you may have other commodities in that warehouse? - We have gums, saffron, and a great many different articles.</p>
               <p>

            Supposing this had been an indictment for stealing saffron, or any other article in your warehouse by having taken out some to have compared, would you have been able to swear to the identical commodity that belonged to you? - There is certainly a difference in almost all articles, but with respect to saffron I am not a judge.</p>

            Whether there might not be produced from other warehouses samples the same you now produce to the jury? - I cannot say that such, samples could not be produced from other warehouses, but from the concurring circumstances I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was so far advanced in a state of intoxication that it is impossible for me to charge my memory with what I did, Mr. Pearson knows that there were several bags in that warehouse for two or three days before, opened, and I had orders to mend them, but for want of a needle I did not, and my fellow servant, Benjamin Wood, if he was here he would certify the same.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Was he drunk at the time that you took him? - By no means he was not.</p>
               <p>Court to Wainwright. Was the man drunk? - I cannot say he was drunk, he did seem as if he had had a little, he asked for some brandy at the Mansion House, and I told him he had better not have any more.</p>
               <p>Court to Jenkins. Did this man appear drunk? - He appeared to have been drinking, but he knew what he was about as well as I.</p>
               <p>Court to Pearson. Had you given him any orders to mend the bags? - I don't recollect I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any bags torn in this way, so as to have any out? -  They are guarded by the thread, and frequently the string that is at the corner will be loosed; there was one bag that we could get two fingers in, and we weighed the bag, and there was none missing, it was perfectly weight.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. I should think if there was a hole of two inches at the bottom of a bag it would admit of a large quantity of this small sort of grain to run out? - It cannot, except the commodity laid above the hole.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps it did? - It did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know his person before this? - I never saw him before in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there warehouses up stairs? - He was up in the garret, after that I took hold of him by the collar and took him down stairs along with me, and delivered him to Mr. Gordy.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him examined? - No, he had no bundle in his hand, that was all he had.</p>
               <p>Q. You said he had a sample in his hand? - That was all he had, it was a little bag tied up; the constable has the bag, I see it delivered to the constable, there was only one head out in the whole place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever compare it with the same sugar that was in the cask? - It was the very same sugar, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I did not offer to hide myself away from you when I met you? - He hid himself behind the hogshead with his head down, I did not know he was there till he coughed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find him walking there, or was he standing still? - He stood still when I came to him.</p>
               <p>Court to Gordy. Was the property in the warehouse of which Benjamin speaks of, under the care of your gang? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was all the sugar there belonging to your gang? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the hogshead broke open? - I did not.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to see whether any sugar was missing? - It is impossible to tell for the value of three pounds what was taken out, I suppose the cask wanted a matter of a hundred pounds weight of being full, but the head was out of the hogshead, part of it; I have got a sample of the sugar here that I took out of the cask.</p>
               <p>Court to Gordy. What may be the value of the sugar that was taken? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150058"/>Of the value of one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I went up in the warehouse for to set the capstains up, when I came up there I found it was set up, and I returned again, and came out of the warehouse, as I came along the warehouse I saw this bag lay with the sugar in, I did not put it in at all; as I was coming out I met this man, he asked me what it was? I said I believed it was sugar, says he come down along with me, I went down stairs with him. I have not got any one to speak for me at all.</p>

I live at Mr. Dean's, the corner of King-street, the Castle, he had lived with us about three weeks before the 13th of December, about seven o'clock he had to go to Mr. Marriott's for the pots, he had to go several times before there. My mistress keeps a public house; a little after ten o'clock my work being done I asked him to let me pass him to sit down, which is a place we always fit in ourselves, he went to move on to let me pass him to sit down, and in his left hand breeches pocket there was a silver spoon, the bowl was down in his pocket, and the handle was out so that I could take hold of it, I asked him what he had got there? he made me no answer, I took the silver spoon directly, and told my mistress it was a spoon that Thomas had got, my mistress told me it must belong to Mr. Marriott, and to go with it there, and ask them whether it belonged to them or not; I did so, the prisoner went with me, and I asked Mrs. Marriott whether it was her property? and she said it was her property, and she said it was one of her best spoons and Mr. Newman was sent for and given charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You and this man lived fellow servants together? - Three weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not agree very well I believe? - We never had any fallings out as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he accuse you of drinking rather a drop too much sometimes? - No, he did not, I do not believe he was sober at that time, he told me that he took it out of one of Mr. Marriott's quart pots, with a design to bring it back, so he told my Lord at the Mansion House.</p>
               <p>Q. He knew perfectly well you was going to Mr. Marriott's, he went with you readily? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. There was no constable? - There was not.</p>
               <p>Q. He is a poor foolish, idle, drunken fellow, is not he? - I cannot say about his idleness, he was very short at our house.</p>
               <p>Q. He is rather silly, is not he? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150059"/>Q. He fetched away his pots late that evening? - About seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. He never attempted to go away at all? - He did not.</p>
               <p>Court to Marriott. Is that your spoon? - Yes, my name is on the back of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were your spoons usually placed? - They are usually carried to a house maid, who stands to receive them, and bring them into the house, into a kitchen, there they are washed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where do you keep your porter pots? - The porter pots stand in different situations in the house, in general by the bar, in order that we may observe who comes to take them, but sometimes they may be left in different parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do they find their way to the kitchen, where these spoons are washed? - There is not a doubt but they may do so, the rule is that they are not to come there, though they might come there, but we generally have them near the bar, that they may not have any pretence of going to any other part of the house to seek for the pots; I frequently find them in different parts of the house for pots, and I ask them what they do there? they say they come for pots, I tell them they have no business to come there, if they want pots to speak for them.</p>
               <p>- NEWMAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a constable, the young man was delivered to me and the spoon; I took him before the Lord Mayor and I have had the spoon in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys to Marriott. You don't know the particular servant in your house who had the care of that particular spoon? - I don't know indeed, that day I might have a hundred and fifty spoons about the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the negligence of a servant might leave it where the pot boy might find it, none of your servants who had the care of the plate are here? - No.</p>
               <p>

            Therefore we cannot tell how they might dispose of them? has not this boy been instrumental in returning to you a piece of plate that was lost at one time? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was in a quart pot, I did not see it till I brought it home, and I put it into my pocket till such time as I had leisure to take it home, which I put in my pocket, and sat down, I did not think of it immediately, the maid took it out of my pocket, I have some witnesses with respect to my character.</p>
               <p>The prisoner called five witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

I told them, I thought, I did; we went in search of them, but did not find them; on Saturday morning we first found they lived in Parker's-lane, I went there, and they were gone; then I heard again, they lived in Lukener's-lane; on Sunday morning we went there; we went and knocked at the door, somebody opened the door; this

               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. He was sleeping with another woman, was not he? - Yes, but there were three beds in the room. And then she went, and put her hand into the gentleman's coat pocket, and took out a pocket-book. I cannot say for how many guineas she took out, I saw three guineas; then she went and took his breeches from under his head, from under his bolster; and then she had the three dollars, and three guineas in her hand; after that, she told me to stay in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. All this past in the room where this gentleman slept? - It did. I wanted to go out to the other house to Mrs. Johnson, and she told me to stop there; she left the room, and went into the next house, and I stopped in the room till she was gone; then I took the candle up, as I found she did not come back, to go to bed, and went out of the room, and locked the door on the outside, and went into the other house too; then when I went in to Mrs. Johnson's, she told me to go in, and go to bed; and I went into this room where this gentleman slept, and bolted the door with two bolts on the inside.

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner Madden, come into the room any more? - Yes, she came in the morning, and brought a candle for the gentleman to look for his money, about eight o'clock. She felt also in his coat pockets, and looked into his pocket-book; then he went, and knocked at Mrs. Johnson's door for a light, and this Nance Madden came, and went and got a penny candle, and brought him a light, and he did not find any thing.</p>

               <p>Q. Where does your sister live? - In New Gravel-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make acquaintance with her there? - She enticed me from my sister-in-law's to go to her lodgings, between nine and ten at night; she lodges just a few doors above, at Ratcliff-Highway, near my sister's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to her lodgings? - Yes, between nine and ten, and we went to bed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you both undressed? - Yes. I had two guineas and a half in gold in a purse, and five penny-worth of halfpence, and three shillings in silver.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did you put your breeches, when you went to bed? - Under my head, and the three shillings was in my waistcoat pocket along with the halfpence.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen this money before? - Just at going to bed. I counted the money to her.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to count the money to her? - Because my sister-in-law followed me to the door, and told me,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150069"/>I should be robbed, if I slept with that girl all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you shewed her all this money before you went to bed? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you shewed her how you kept it? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that you was quite sober after all this advice of your sister? How long had you been drinking that day? - I had not been drinking a great deal that day.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you been drinking all day? - No. I had the share of two or three pots in the evening, that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first miss your money that night? - I cannot justly say, I waked with cold, and she was gone. The clothes of the bed were turned down; my clothes were still abiding, they were there; I left the house in the morning at eight o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. After you first awoke, what time might you get up? - I cannot say, at that time, I first awaked, the mistress of the house was up; I called, and she came with a lighted candle, and I asked her, if she knew, where the girl was? I believe she is not here. I missed my money then, she said, she did not know any thing about it; she told me, if I made any disturbance there, she would have me turned out of the house; and as I had paid for the bed, I might stay, if I would be peaceable; so I set myself down by the bed-side till morning.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not tell before, that you had paid any money for the bed? - I had paid the girl half a crown that I slept with, the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when you got up? - I got up, and asked her what recompence I should have for it? she said, she did not know any thing about it; so I made the best of my way down towards the shipping, to look out for more bread; and I met a shipmate, and he advised me to go back, and get an officer; I went, and got an officer; and we went after the prisoner, and we found her off the Unicorn, that was a few doors above the lodgings, Ratcliff-Highway.</p>
               <p>Q. At what o'clock was it? - I believe, it might be between nine and ten the time of taking her.</p>
               <p>Q. What past then, did you find any money? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever found any money? - No, never found any at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Catharine Johnson? - Here she is.</p>
               <p>Q. Who does the house belong to? - To one Mrs. Turner, as I have heard, I don't know that of my own knowledge.</p>
               <p>CATHARINE JOHNSON sworn.</p>
               <p>That girl robbed the prosecutor; the girl said herself, that she had robbed him; I went to her to the Lock-up-house, I said, how came you to rob my brother, who has a wife, and two or three children? she said, she did not pocket the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her, it would be better for her to confess? - I did not; the first thing I said, was, how came you to rob my brother? she said, that she did not pocket a farthing of the money, that Hannah got it; meaning I suppose, the landlady.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation are you to Hemson? - He married my sister-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure, that you heard what the prisoner said at the Lock-up-house, because you are very deaf? - I am sure, that was what she said.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never said any such thing; when I was in the Lock-up-room, she came, and scratched me down the face, and abused me. I wish to know what fort of a house she keeps.</p>
               <p>Court to Johnson. What sort of a house do you keep? - I have but a single member, and I have been three months lately in Scarborough.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150070"/>Q. Do you know the house where Hemson slept with this girl? - I know the house, it is in New Gravel-lane, not far from me; she says, Will Turner keeps it; he kept it, and he has let it to this Hannah for a guinea a week.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask her, how long it is since her first husband and her son was hanged.</p>
               <p>I was in bed with that man, but I did not take a farthing from him.</p>

It was on the 17th of December, I was robbed by this man, I believe it was on a Tuesday, about six o'clock in the evening, as I was crossing over this hither side of <placeName id="t17940115-26-crimeloc135">Piccadilly</placeName>

And two, one held me by one arm, and the other, by the other arm, and there were others. behind me, and others before me, and I was pressed very much, and had no liberty to move; one seized me by the right arm, and the other, by the left arm; and I was turned round by them, with my back towards the people; and the person who had hold of my left arm, who was the prisoner at the bar. I believe, it is the same person. I am pretty sure it is; he stooped down, and in an instant almost, he took my watch out of my pocket. I saw him stoop, I did not see his face then; I felt him pull it out.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to say, that he was the man that pulled the watch out, or did you only feel it pulled out? - The man that had hold of my left arm pulled the watch out, and I believe, it was the prisoner; the man that had hold of my right arm, he confined me, and held me; I cried out, stop thief! instantly, I had no other remedy the moment, and he ran, he fled immediately, I had a view of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face at any time? - I did not, he concealed his face, and stooped down, when he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see his face when he ran? - He ran from me to the eastward, and I only see his hinder parts; and I had a view of him, till he was stopped by the patrole; his companions fled to the westward, if he had taken the same road, I had not seen him. I saw him stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that man to stop him? - I cried out, stop thief! The man was brought to a Hosier's shop, the corner of Bond-street, and there he said, his name was Foster, and that he was a coach-maker by trade, and then worked for a master in Queen-street, near Lincoln's-inn-fields; after that, he was taken away by the patrole, and I saw no more of him; and I was ordered to attend at Bow-street on the morrow.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner searched? - I don't know, whether he was, or not. But no watch was produced, I believe. I did not see him searched.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch since? - I have never heard of it, nor seen it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a silver watch, and a steel chain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a metal watch key? - Yes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150071"/>Q. Whether you are perfectly sure, when the prisoner made away from you, that you never lost sight of him, till he was taken by another man? - There was not a great croud about me, only six, I believe, them to be all of a gang; but when I cried, stop thief! they all dispersed immediately, and this man, he sled by himself; I took particular notice of him; he left his companions; had he fled with his companions, I should not have discovered him. I am sure, that the man that fled by himself was the man that was taken. I believe on my conscience, that he took the watch, and I believe on my conscience, that, that man before robbed me of a watch chain. When he came into the stocking shop, I said, I was sure, he was the man, though he concealed his face. I had no doubt at that time, nor have I any now.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was taken into custody, he said, it was a shorter person than what I am, that robbed him of his watch? - No, I did not say any such thing, I am certain of it, I said he robbed me, and I was certain of it.</p>
               <p>Q. There were several people at the time, when he said, that a shorter man than me robbed him? - I insist on the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. The gentleman says that I never was out of his fight till such times as I was taken, I was taken about ten minutes after this robbery was committed, I was brought into the shop where this gentleman was, and he said he could not swear to any body at all? - I believe it might be ten minutes when he came, but I saw him stopt at the corner of Duke-street, but they could not take him till he run a little further from thence, as I understand.</p>
               <p>Court. You was robbed near Bond-street? - Yes, on the further side of Piccadilly, on the foot way.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you mean on the foot way? - I mean the cross way; I see him run to the eastward, towards St. James's Church, and I see him stopt at Duke-street, but I understand he was not taken there.</p>

            What distance might you be from Duke-street, where he was stopped? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run or walk? - He ran very swift all the way, I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see him run in Duke-street, Duke-street is at the right? - I was not at the taking of him, I never lost sight of him till he was at the corner of Duke-street, but he ran farther before he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Then during that interval from Duke-street to where he was taken, did you lose sight of him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. I understood you before, that you saw him taken, that makes a deal of difference? - I see him as far as Duke-street, from the place where I stopped, and he was stopped there, but he ran further, and he was brought back to the hosier's shop, a very short time after he robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Now I must again put the question to you, and ask you this, as you did not see the man's face, and he was out of your sight for some little time, will you venture to swear positively that the man that was brought back, was the man that robbed you? - Yes, because I took such particular notice of his binder parts.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember what his hair was? - His hair to my remembrance was locks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember whether it was powdered or plain? - It was not powdered.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it a great coat or a common coat that he had on? - It was a light coloured coat.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150072"/>Q. Do you remember whether he had boots on? - No, he had no boots on, for his legs were very taper, and his stockings were not so light as his coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who stopped him at the corner of Duke-street? - It was one of the patroles.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they lay their hands on him? - I don't know, I saw him run down Duke-street.</p>
               <p>Q. You have told us before, half a dozen times over, that he was stopped at the corner of Duke-street? - I saw him stopped at the corner of Duke-street, but he went on again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any man lay his hands on him at the corner of Duke-street? - I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you will not swear that he was stopped, and you did not stop him? - I saw him stopped at the corner of Duke-street, and he went on again; it was an elderly man that stopped him, and he then took another course.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you saw an elderly man stop him, at the corner of Duke-street? - I do, but not one of these men that are here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was brought into the shop I was searched, the gentleman said that he could not swear to my person at the time, that it was a shorter person than me that robbed him? - I said I did not see his face, when he robbed me, and I could not swear to his face but I certainly thought he was the man from the view that I had of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not the patrole tell you that you must swear to me? - No, the patrole said nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you always insist on this, that you believed him to be the man? - I did not only believe, but I was certain that he was the man that robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. When he ran had he any hat on? - Yes, he had a hat, I think it was a cocked hat, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said that he did believe me to be the person, and he wished the people to let me go? - I never said so.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole. Please your lordship and gentlemen of the jury, on the 17th of December we were walking along on the right hand side of Piccadilly just as we got near Bond-street, I heard the word, stop thief! stop thief! Rivett's and Skeates were with me, we were just past Duke-street, a few yards on the right hand side, towards the corner of Bond-street, and that side of the way; momentarily I said to my partner that was behind me, look out, for there is somebody coming, as soon as we saw him coming we made over the way, and endeavoured to stop him just at the corner of Duke-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you see before you got over the way? - I see him run as fast as ever he could, on the left hand side coming towards Duke-street, on the opposite side to what I was, we crossed over very fast after him, just as we came to the corner of Duke-street I was very nigh to him, but I had not hold of him, by the reason of the buckle of my shoe flew out of my shoe, and I could not make the speed to overtake him, by that, one of my fellow servants followed him, and when he got down into Jermyn-street there he was stopped.</p>
               <p>Q. You see a man in Piccadilly, you then see him in Jermyn-street, did you lose sight of him till he was taken? - I never lost sight of him, from the first time I saw him in Piccadilly till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. And then you took him, or see him taken? - We found we could not make speed to catch him, we hallooed out stop thief and he was stopped, and we took hold of him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you one of the men that stopped him in Jermyn-street? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did you stop him? - We stopped him in the street, and brought him back, Rivett's, and I, and my partner, Skeates, we took him to the corner of Bond-street, to the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you find out the person? - We were told by people that called out.</p>
               <p>

            You did not see him near the prosecutor at the time of the running? - No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the prosecutor? - In the shop, he was at the corner, brought in, and he said when the prisoner came in, that he was the man that took his watch, that was in the hearing of the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he always insist on that, that he was the man that robbed him? - He said, he had no doubt at all but he was the man.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the prisoner dressed? - In a light coloured coat, he had a pair of dark coloured stockings on, I did not observe any thing particular else.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he searched? - He was, in the shop, there was nothing found on him, I asked him his name when I searched him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the watch ever found? - Never as I heard of, all that I have to say, I asked him what he was? I knew his features, though I did not know his name, he said his name was John Foster, and he worked in Queen-street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I wish to ask the person standing there, whether he did not tell the magistrate that his buckle flew out of his shoe, and that he was obliged to stop, and never came nigh me till such times as I was taken? - I told the magi<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150074"/>strate I could not catch him at the corner of Duke-street, because my buckle fell out of my shoe, but I followed him, and he never was out of my sight.</p>

               <p>I am a patrole belonging to Bow-street; I was at the cry of stop thief, on Tuesday, the 17th of December, about six o'clock in the evening, we were walking up the right hand side of Piccadilly, I heard the words of stop him! stop him! stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. How far might you be from crossing over from Bond-street? - About an hundred yards of this side of Bond-street. Chapman said there is somebody coming, look sharp, I stopped momentarily I heard the word stop thief, presently I saw the prisoner on the foot pavement, running very swift, he was running the left hand side, the opposite side, I did not see the prosecutor there.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts might the prisoner be, from the turning of Duke-street, when you first see him? - When I see him he might be fifty yards of the other side of Duke-street.</p>

            Supposing you was to cross over to the other side of Piccadilly, how far was the prisoner from Bond-street, I don't want you to allow for crossing over of the street? - He might be a hundred yards, I followed him down Duke-street, and he ran in Jermyn-street, and there I came up to him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever lose sight of him from the first time you saw him running? - No, I came up to him in Jermyn-street, I did not stop him, a man ran before him, and I was up that instant, and had hold of his right arm, that man gave him a check, and that moment I went up and took him into the stocking shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I was first taken a master butcher and a gentleman's servant took me, I knew nothing about this man at all, and he knows nothing at all about me, this man came up afterwards, and they took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Court to Chapman. Were not Rivett's and skeates the men that in fact laid hold of him? - No, my lord, Skeates was not up, Rivett's and I took him, we were the first that had hold of him to bring him back.</p>
               <p>Q. The question I ask you now is who was it laid hold of this man in Jermyn-street first? - Rivett's was the man that had hold of him first.</p>

               <p>Q. I asked you over and over again who stopped him, and you insisted on it that you stopped him, now it comes out Rivett's stopped him.</p>
               <p>Rivetts. I detained him, I had hold of his right arm.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Neither of these men were nigh me for ten minutes, a master butcher and a gentleman's servant in livery, were the first that had hold of me.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I cannot say no more than that I know nothing about this business what I am charged with now; I come out of the country only of the Monday, at Paddington I dined on Tuesday, I got myself into employ and work, and I was took as I was coming along, it was quite totally different to what they tell you, I was taken by a master butcher and a gentleman's servant; none of these people were nigh the place at the time when I went into the shop, the gentleman said it was a shorter person than me that robbed him, I am as innocent as a child unborn of the affair that I am challenged with now, I had a master here yesterday, that I worked for in Oxford-road, but he is not here now.</p>
               <p>Court to Barrobee. Were the lamps alight at this time? - Yes, I had the benefits of the lamps, because there was a coach standing at the end of Bond-street, which darted the light.</p>

               <p>I live in apartments, in a gallery, the landlady lives in the same gallery, at some distance from my apartment, but it is all one connected building; I went to bed on the 17th of December, and I was alarmed in the night, between twelve and one, and I got up on that alarm, and went out into an adjoining house, in an adjoining room, and in an adjoining window that connected with my apartment, I saw the prisoner, and he was detained by the skirt of his coat, that he could not get away, and when I got to him I took him, I found he had put my coat on under his own coat, I have had the coat eighteen years, I can swear it is my coat, the coat was taken off my bed.</p>

               <p>I am an hostler, I was going by, and I saw the prisoner come out of this man's parlour window, between the hours of twelve and one in the morning, I went to him and laid hold of him with my right hand, and asked him what business he had there? immediately I called out for assistance, and the prosecutor came out of his bed; and the skirt of the prisoner's coat catched hold of the window somehow, and he could not get off; he had the prosecutor's coat under his own coat, we took it from him, and I have had it in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along this gallery, I had no where to sleep, and I saw this coat lay and I picked it up, and that man came up to me, and asked me what I had to do with it? I told him what was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150076"/>that to him, and he called Mr. Young, and told him I had come out of a window, and they took me to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to Hatton-garden office. On Monday the 6th of January there was a search warrant granted at our office, and I went and searched the prisoner's lodgings, he told me himself they were rooms where he slept, I found these files in a tub, under his bed's head, I took the files and brought the prisoner to the office, I have had the care of the files ever since.</p>

               <p>Q. How came he to tell you they were in his rooms? - He said he bought the files in Rag Fair.</p>
               <p>Q. How came he to tell you they were in his rooms? - He did not tell me they were in his rooms, we were talking as we were going to the office about something or other, that was the way it came out; here are six files which I found in a box of his, which are finished files.</p>

               <p>Court to Prosecutor. Are those six files found in the box in the indictment? - Yes, they are all in the indictment, they are half round files, on the half round files I put a single H. on the tang of them, the letter is struck on the steel.</p>

               <p>I am an officer of the police; I know the prisoner at the bar, he lives in the parish of St. Botolph, Aldgate, in Lower East Smithfield. On the 25th of November last, I went to a house in <placeName id="t17940115-29-crimeloc150">Lower East Smithfield</placeName>

               <p>Q. Was it the prisoner's house? - I cannot say that, he was there; I, in company with West and Riley, went into the barber's shop, they are two officers belonging to the same office; the prisoner at the bar was in the shop, and another man, standing by the fire.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find them in the barber's shop? - Below stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the prisoner a barber? - Yes, I told him to shut his front door, he said he would, but desired I would not make a noise, I told him I had information that there was coining in his house, supposing it to be his house; immediately we secured the man that was standing by the fire and him, and took them along with us; we took them both into the back room on the same floor; in the interim of time there came a third man to the back door.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe that back door? - There is a passage that leads through by the side of the shop, and there is a door behind, but you must come in at the front door first before you can come to the back door; on the right hand is the door of the shop, and then you go along the passage by the door of the shop. He came into the back room, into the same room where we were and we secured him. I acquainted the prisoner that we must find the cellar, I asked for the key of the cellar door and which way we should get in it? he hesitated some moments, but at last he went up stairs as I thought to bring the key, but he came down without it, in about a minute not exceeding more; then Mr. West insisted he would tear the floor open<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150078"/>if he did not shew him the way into the cellar; says he, hold your tongue and I will, he then opens a closet door, in the same back room where we were, and shews us a trap batch door at the bottom of the closet, we then lifted the trap batch up, there was no stairs to go down into the cellar, but a chair at the bottom; I dropped down on the chair with a candle, and there I perceived the implements for coining which I now produce; these two dies I found in the press, these farthings I found some in the box and round the press; the other dies were about the press, close to the press, and I found a quantity of blanks, I suppose they were for halfpence, and likewife a quantity of blanks for farthings; I then put them all together and proceeded to take down the press and get them up in the back room, in the mean time the prisoner at the bar escaped, that is all I can say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up stairs? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you find there? - I did not go rightly into the room, I saw a woman and some children in the bed.</p>
               <p>Q. There is a further door at which the third man came in, did it go into the shop or only into this back room? - It goes into the back room, and from thence into the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Between the back room and the shop there is a door that communicates? - There is.</p>

            Is there any light at all, except what you carried down, in the cellar? - No, there is nothing but a front place that they may open, which comes into the street.</p>
               <p>Q. The door that communicates with the shop was not locked? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long that man had lived there? - I do not.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knapp. Did you understand that he had a room up stairs? - I understood that his family was up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. He was an hair dresser you know? - He may be an hair dresser for what I know, I know he shaved a man while I was there.</p>
               <p>Q. There are two other tenants in this house I understand? - I understood there were some people up stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand at the time that all the part of the house that this prisoner had, was the shop in which he performed his business, and that his bed room was up stairs? - I understood that he occupied the whole, being the landlord he might let it out.</p>

               <p>Q. We understand then that he was the very person, when you told him your business, that gave you all the information; he went down with you in the cellar? - No, he did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did all the officers go down at that time? - Only me and Mr. West,

             the 25th of November, to search the cellar under this man's premises.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it happen to you, to know any thing of the prisoner? - I know that he occupied them premises for many months before; I can say, ten; I know he acted as master of the shop, and he even told me so himself, in the summer time.</p>
               <p>Q. Now on this day when you went, tell us what you have done, or what you did? - I went into the shop in the morning about seven o'clock, he was sitting by the fire with one that we suspected to be one of the coiners; I knew him to be a Jew, and knew him well; I took the candle that was burning out of the sconces, and could not find any door to enter into the cellar; I was a little struck at that; I insisted on knowing the way into the cellar, and the cellar door that came out into the street was barricadoed up. It was a slap barricadoed up altogether, fastened on purpose to work by candle all hours of the day; we saw a glimmering of light the Sunday evening before, and they were at work as we imagined. This was Monday morning we found them. On Sunday evening, passing by here, we observed the glimmering of a light, we went on purpose then to make the search. I was desirous of finding the way into the cellar from within; as soon as I insisted on going down, or pulling up the floor, the prisoner said, be easy and quiet, you will hurt my business, and pointing to the two men, signifying that they were the two coiners; the one that sat in the room inside, and the other that was by the fire side when we came in, and said, you are right, he went up stairs, and down again, in less than a minute, and when he came down, he opened the closet door, which was in the room, where he, and his family cohabits and lives.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of his family were on the premises? - I don't know, he has got a wife, and a child or two, I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was his wife there? - Not then.</p>
               <p>Q. At any time before, did you ever know his wife to be there with him in that room? - I cannot say, I did. When he came down, he went to this closet where the drop door was, and he opened the drop door to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Court. Was it fastened by a lock and key? - No, it opened without.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lock to the closet-door, out of which closet led to the trap-door? - Not that I saw. Cook went into the cellar with me.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the prisoner, did he come down into the cellar with you? - No. We staid in the cellar, I suppose, twenty minutes; I cried out to Mr. Riley, stop them two men, don't suffer them to make their escape! The prisoner, however, made his escape; the other man, we took before the magistrate. And I found these things in company with Cook, and a great deal more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You have been in court while the other witness was examined? You heard what he said? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard him, perhaps, say, that he did not know, whether this back parlour belonged to the prisoner, or no? - I know his wife lighted a fire before I came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you understand that where his wife and family lived, was up stairs? - I don't know that, I understood that he kept the whole house, and let it out in lodgings.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you understand, that he had a room up stairs, where his wife and children were? - I never was up stairs. I understood him to keep the whole house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you understand, that he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150080"/>let out the house in tenements to different people? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, whether he occupied the back parlour, you don't know? - I have seen him there many a time, it looks as if he occupied it.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps, it looks as if you would have a reward, if these men were convicted? - I know nothing of a reward. I know it now, you have told me.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the room? - His wife was not there then. There were some women that came down, his wife, or his sister, for what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. You immediately told the prisoner what you came about, that there was coining in the house? and then he said, be easy, don't hurt me? - He said so, he was about two yards distant from me. Hush, says he, be quiet, and I will let you know, and then he pointed to the two men.</p>

            Those were the two men that were given in charge? He himself pointed to the trap door which led to the cellar, and every thing where the things were found? there he staid, and shewed you? - Because he could not help himself, and because it could not be there without his knowledge; if he had not, I would have pulled up the floor; I went up with that intent.</p>
               <p>Q. However, he did tell you, and shewed you where you wanted to go.</p>

               <p>On the 20th of December last, I went to enquire for my husband at a Mr. Brown's, he lives in at a place called Pelican Stairs, down at Cox's-lane, it was between eleven and twelve in the day; I went to see if my husband was gone to Wapping, I did not find him there; two men were there, the prisoners at the bar. I am quite sure, they are the two men Mr. Brown's is a public house; one of them told me, that he knew my husband, and that he had worked along with him three or four days, Thomas Whellum told me that; he told me, that he expected my husband was coming into the house; I told him, if I thought my husband was coming into the house, I would stay half an hour, and wait upon my husband. I came out of the house to go home at the end of the half hour, and they followed me out; they asked me, if I would go, and have share of a pot of beer? they expected my husband every moment; they asked me to go into the sign of the Crown, in Fox's-lane, to take a part of a pot? and I did go in, and sat down, and I went out, and came back again, and I found them both there.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was you out in all? - When I came back, that man, Whellum, told me, that he was sure my husband was coming, and he insisted I should wait for him; I told them after wards, I would go home, it was then about three o'clock; because if my husband went home, I had got the key, and he could not get in; I went; they followed me out of the house, both of the prisoners. We staid there till about eight o'clock; in coming out to go home, the landlady of the house, asked this prisoner in the brown coat, Whellum, whether he should see me safe home to my own husband? he said, he knew my husband very well, and it would be no trouble to him at all, to see me safe home to my own husband. I went up, to go home the broad way near the church, up Fox's-lane, both the prisoners were with me. When I went up the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150082"/>street, I knew my way to my own house, and they told me, they would take me a nigher way home; they took me up into David's-lane, and from there, they told me, they would take me a nigher way; and they took me into a rope ground, which has no thoroughfare. When I came there, one in each hand drove me down the steps, both of them. They asked me, what I would give them, if I had got any money about me? I told them, I had two shillings in my pocket, I would give it them, if they would let me go home to my own place to my husband; it was between nine and ten at this time; they cut my pocket off, and took the two shillings, I cannot say which. One held me, while the other took them from me. I had nothing but the two shillings in my pocket, and the key of the room; they took my bonnet, my handkerchief, and apron, and cut my under petticoat off; the man, Whellum, in the brown coat, stripped me of my things, and the other held me. I asked them, why they served me so? and they knocked me down, and ran both away together; I called out, murder! for some time, and I saw nobody coming, and at last, a young man came, and took me up first, and a woman came to assist him, and they took me home to my husband's place.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see your goods again? - I saw them a week after that, almost a week, on a Thursday, it was a Friday they robbed me, and Thursday next the goods were found, the two officers found them going to be pawned; I saw them in the hands of the officers.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not, of your own knowledge, know what became of the goods, till you saw them in the hands of the officer? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that all your know of the matter? - That is all.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell me how you passed your time from ten o'clock in the morning till eight at night? - I went there about twelve in the day, to Mr. Brown's, to enquire for my husband, he is a labouring man, he works on board a ship, I drank a little with the two men, I was not all the while with them, I was twice out and in, I cannot say how long each of those times; I was twice out, if not three times; the first time half an hour; the second time a quarter of an hour; and the third time the same.</p>

               <p>Court. All the three times together would make about an hour; therefore there were seven hours spent in the two public houses.</p>
               <p>Q. How much liquor had you drank? - I don't know what was drank, I did drink along with them.</p>
               <p>

            What did you drink, gin or beer? - There was both gin and beer drank, I cannot say how much, two or three pots called for to my knowledge, but there were more people drank along with them than me, I did not drink much of the beer.</p>
               <p>Q. How much gin was called for? - A quartern of gin when they came in, and a quartern when they went out. I had two glasses of gin, and drank some beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it you received the blow, that knocked you down in the rope ground? Whereabouts on the body? - On my cheek.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you lived in this part of the country? - Five years; I came from Scotland.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you was perfectly sober at this time? - I was drinking along with them, and I was sure that they meant no good in keeping me. I was not so drunk but I knew<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150083"/>very well what they meant, but the fright made me sober quite.</p>
               <p>Jury. Why did you go with them if you was afraid of being knocked down by them? - They told me that they would see me home, and they would not use me ill; I was afraid of going along with them, when I went out of the house.</p>

               <p>Q. How comes it, as you was desirous of getting home in the day time, that you did not go home, as you had the key in your pocket? - This prisoner in the brown coat said, that he was very well known to my husband, and that he was coming in every moment there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they keep you there seven hours in this manner? - I was not seven hours with them; it was twelve o'clock when I got there, and I went out.</p>
               <p>Q. If you felt a pressing desire to go home to your husband, why did not you go home? - I said that I wanted to go home several times.</p>

               <p>I am the constable of Shadwell police office. On the 25th of December, I was applied to by one Lewis Lloyd, who informed me, that his wife had been robbed a few days before, by two men, and that he knew where to find one of them then; accordingly I and Webster went along with him, and called at a house of Mr. Ramsey's, he keeps a public house, the bottom of Fox's-lane, Shadwell, where Lloyd's wife was at that time, he told us the house where we might very likely find one of the men; we went into the house and saw a man, answering the description that he gave, it is situated near the end of Wapping Wall, very near the other public house. I found the prisoner Whellum there, standing by the fire; the woman came after us and pointed the man out, and said, that is one of the men that robbed me; the woman went back to her husband; we took Whellum into custody, and called at Ramsey's as we were going to the office, to take her and her husband up with us to the office, and I found this bonnet and apron at Whellum's house, here is one callico handkerchief, and another silk one, and one flannel petticoat, I found at the pawnbroker's.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lloyd. They are all my property, I bought them and paid for them, I made my apron, and petticoat, and handkerchief. They were the things that were on me the 20th of December.</p>
               <p>Aberley. Whellum's wife informed me, that she had sent a woman, of the name of Last, to pledge the handkerchief, petticoat, and apron, at a pawnbroker's, in Whitechapel, but could not tell where. I found her at a pawnbroker's, nearly opposite the London Hospital, in the Whitechapel-road; I happened to go into the right pawnbroker's shop, where I found the woman offering the things to pledge, the pawnbroker had got the handkerchief in his hand then, and informed me that she had asked three shillings, or three shillings and six-pence for them; I see they were the property as was described, and I took her into custody, and took the goods.</p>

Mr. Aberley, some time after that, asked him where he lived? and he told him, he gave the right direction; we went then, and we asked his wife where such things were? she denied them; says I, I am come from your husband, and I must have the property, and she opened a chest in the room, and we found this bonnet and this apron; his wife said it was not her bonnet, that it belonged to the woman that was gone to pawn the other things; I stayed in the house while Mr. Aberley went and brought the woman back with the other things. He in the smock frock, Miller, was taken on Saturday following, between five and six, in a lodging house, and accordingly the justice asked him what he had got to say for himself? he said it was not him that robbed the woman, it was the other man.</p>

            . I was in at Mr. Rayner's house, St. George's, Middlesex, a public house, and a fellow servant of mine came and called me out, there was some body crying murder! I went out, after I came out I heard some body halloo out murder! and I went down the rope ground, Mr. Thompson's, and I went down the steps, and I saw a woman laying on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she close to the steps? - About a hundred yards from the steps. I went to her, and when I helped her up, her pocket lay on the ground, and my fellow servant he picked her pocket up, and I helped her up the steps to a woman, Catharine North, and helped her over the road, and she sat down along with the woman, while I was drinking the remaining part of my pint of beer, and then I went home with her, and she seemed to me to be in liquor; she told me what she had lost, but she did not seem property to have her senses; she told me where she lived, she lived in Cox's-court, she gave a rational account where she lived and whose wife she was.</p>

               <p>On Friday the 20th of December, these two men and woman came into my house, it is in Fox's-lane, a public house, I think, to the best of my knowledge, it was about eleven in the morning, they stayed all the day, till about eight o'clock, to the best of my remembrance.</p>
               <p>Q. What liquor had they been drinking at that time? - They had porter to drink for the most part; I cannot recollect how much, I know of four pots.</p>
               <p>Q. Who drank the four pots of beer? - There were more in company, but whether they invited them to drink with them I cannot say, there were people came in and out.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect any thing of the gin that they drank? - I served two quarterns of gin, I know no more; that makes half a pint.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing in their conversation and discourse? - I did not, I did not give any attention to what passed between them. When they left the house I said, take care of the woman, she appears to be in liquor; they said they were afraid of that, they knew the woman very well, and they would take her home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Whellum. When I was going out of doors this woman sat asleep, drunk, and this gentlewoman said, I don't know whether she can walk or not, and this man, Miller, said he would take her home; she made answer and said, to my husband; and he said, yes; that is all.</p>

               <p>I was in company with the officers at the time the man was taken up; I was not with them when the things were found; I heard Miller say he was in company with Whellum when he robbed the woman, but he could not help his robbing her.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Whellum. I was waiting for a craft to come in, I was waiting at this house from nine o'clock, thinking there would be an answer come for to go to work again, just before the clock struck eight this woman came, and she asked if her husband was there? and she came up to me, and she said she thought she knew me, and I made answer and said to her again, you may know me, but I don't know you; says she, I think I knew you when you worked at Mr. Perry's dock, at Blackwall; I told her it might be so I had worked there; she made answer that her husband lived at No. 5. Blue Anchor-alley, and that he came from Poplar; I said, I think there is a man that comes from there, he works along with me, and if it is the same he will he here in a minute or two; and so I advised her to wait, but he did not come in, he had got a job; then this woman came up and stood before the fire side, and said it was very cold; I made answer to her, will you have a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150086"/>glass of gin? though I don't know you, you shall have one if you will; and she went and took a glass of gin; then she came back again to the fire side and drank part of two pots of beer; after nine o'clock I said, I would go home to my wife, and we all came out together. When we came to this gentleman's house, Mrs. Ramsey's, just as we got to the door the woman said, what will you give me to drink? if you will give me anything give it me now; Miller answered, will you have part of a pot of beer? I said, I cannot stop, because my wife is very big with child, and I want to go home; after that I granted to go in and have a pot of beer; we had one, two, three, or four pots of beer and a quartern of gin; after I had paid for that liquor this man wanted something to eat, and he went out for a two penny loaf and half a pound of cheese, for something to eat, then afterwards we had another quartern of gin; then after that we were talking to one another, we heard a man playing the fiddle, she calls this man in, and would have him play; after that she goes to the shop across the corner, where she wanted a pair of garters, and wanted this man to buy her a pair, and told him that he should tie them on for her, if he would buy her a pair, but he would not; after that she came and called me out, and asked me if I would buy her a pair of garters? and if I would buy her a pair of garters I might have connection with her, if I would; I made answer I had a wife at home, and I was not used to such work as that; she said she did not come after a man as her husband, it was her brother; she said she lived at No. 5, at Poplar, and that she lived along with another woman at No. 5, at Poplar, at the White Horse, and they carried on the trade and business of a disorderly house, and asked this man and me if we would go home with her? I told them I would not have any thing to do with it; after that she persuaded me to go into the yard behind the house to be great with her; I told her that I would do no such thing; after that she called me out to the door, and told me that she did not like this man; she said she had some knowledge of me, but him she did not know, and desired me not to let any of her things go from her; after that we sat down by the fire again, I wanted to go and see my master, to see if there was a craft come in, and I went down to Mr. Brown's, and I went in and stayed for the valuation of an hour, and could hear no answer, for there was no craft come in, and I came back again to settle my reckoning at the gentlewoman's house, there were two quarterns of gin to pay for, that she had drank at the time that I had gone; she called me over to this shop I spoke of before, and wanted me to have connection with her, and buy her the garters; I told her it would not do for me, that I had a wife that laid very sick at the time, and that what I spent was enough; I told them my expences were as good as five or six shillings that day, and that I could not do it every day; I had four-pence halfpenny left in halfpence, she took it up from my hand and put it into her own pocket.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Miller. I was in company with her, please your worship during the whole time drinking part of the liquor, she asked me to go and buy them garters, for her, so I went out along with her, I would not buy any garters for her, she came in again when I would not buy the garters, and she asked this man, and he would not, he bought no garters for her; so she came back again, and we sat and drank, I know no more than when we were going home this man asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150087"/>to go along with her to see her safe home, and I went along with her.</p>

               <p>I was not sensible that I had lost any thing, till I was called to the Elephant and Castle, Kentish Town, to see some iron that was stopped about seven o'clock at night; on the 20th of December, I was shewn the iron there by Mr. Croker, one of the police officers of Bow-street; some of the iron has been worked, and some unworked. I can say, I know this piece, it was got up for the side of a pair of forging tongs; I know it by the shape and manner in which it was got up. This one piece, I also know, from its being bent in a particular manner hastily, and not properly. I am a coach box and axle tree maker; I cannot be so particular about either of the other two pieces, but I know, they are the kind of iron that we make use of.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see them last before you went to the Elephant and Castle? - I cannot recollect exactly; I had seen one piece the day before, it was laying on the floor in the open smith's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it front the street? - It is within an inclosure, a little way off from the street. This other piece, I saw standing by the side of the forge, where the man worked that had used it; I think it was either one night, or two, before it was found; but I am not certain, I do not recollect the other two pieces. When<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150091"/>I was she was the iron, Mr. Croker asked me, If I knew it? I told him, as I have told you; and I also knew the prisoner at the bar, had first left my shop before the usual time of leaving work; he worked for me; he made a practice of that, because he said, his home was a great way off.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you employed him? - About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the prisoner behave while he was in your service? - He always behaved well, except that I was surprised, that he left work before other people; but that was in some reason accounted for, because he lived in Westminster; he was a sober man, and a good workman.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. At the time, you say, you know the piece of iron by the particular manner of workmanship of it; but you know that workmen use iron in that same way. With respect to this piece bent, other blacksmiths use pieces exactly in the same way that this is in? - Never use it in the condition it is now, it is in its second stage, unfinished. It is bent to put under axle-trees, that they may not get through the fire; and I never saw any man that did it, but this man that did this.</p>
               <p>Q. As to the third piece of iron, you don't recollect when you saw that before? - There is one little circumstance, it was a general rule in our shop, that nobody was to use a piece of iron that was bad.</p>
               <p>Q. You say one piece of iron was within an inclosure? - The whole is within a shop, which shop is within an inclosure.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner quitted his work sooner, because he lived at a great distance, and he always did it? - Not always, but very frequently.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he live at Lambeth, and you work at Pancras? - Yes. I only with to say one thing, there was a dispute about his leaving work, and he had marked to leave off work at seven, but he had left off about a quarter or twenty minutes before; and it was just seven, when I received a message to go to the Elephant and Castle.</p>

               <p>I am one of the conductors of the party of the partoles in Bow-street, and I go the Kentish Town road, and Hampstead road every night. On the 20th of last month, I was going with one man belonging to me towards Pan<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150092"/>cras, just beyond the church; I saw something standing in the dark, in the field between the church and the Elephant and Castle, it appeared to me to be a man; I made towards it, it was near seven, it had not struck; I, and the person that was with me, made round towards him; I went up to him, and I said, halloo, who are you! I thought it was a man drunk; I put my stick down, and I heard the found of iron that was laying on the grass immediately before him. They laid close before him and he standing up, immediately I ordered Mackay, the man that is here, to bring him along to the Elephant and Castle, while I picked up the iron, and a stick laying with it; I asked him, who he was? he hesitated a little, and said, he lived a good way off; I then took him into the public house, to the Elephant and Castle, and the maid servant knew him; and then I had a suspicion that he had come from there, and I asked her, who he worked for? and she told me, and I ordered him to be secured while I went up to his master's house, and the maid servant went with me; and I brought down Mr. Keir, and he said, that the iron was his property. This stick was laying close to the iron, and it all laid before him; he told me, when he went into the public house, that he knew nothing of the iron, but he owned the stick.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Counse. Crocker, you are sure, it was about seven? - I am positive, by the round that I had taken, it was just seven; I generally make remark of the time, but I did not this time; but whether it had struck or no, I cannot say, it was a minute or two, before I went up to Mr. Keir's.</p>
               <p>Q. This footpath through the field is in the direct way to Westminster? - It is the way from Pancras; that back footpath comes directly into Kentish Town; but he was in the field between that footpath and the public road.</p>
               <p>Q. When you took the prisoner, he did not discover any circumstances of sear of apprehension? - He seemed a little chagrined at being taken by a Police officer.</p>
               <p>Q. You never knew him before? - Never; but if I see a man lurking in the fields, I always go to him.</p>
               <p>Q. The maid servant of the house knew him? - She did, she called him by his name immediately.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. After I had done work I had to go to Lambeth; I left off a little before my time, because I had so far to go; I was going home, and just went out of the path way to case myself, and this here Mr. Crocker came up to me just as I was buttoning up my breeches, he asked me what I had got there? I told him that I did not know that I had got any thing there; he stooped and picked up this iron, and he said to me, you may as well go along with it, I suppose you only mean to make a pot of beer with it; I told him it was none of mine, and I would not have any thing to do with it.</p>

               <p>Q. How near was you? - I was within forty yards, just on the right of him, I was so near him that I saw him stand up before ever the gentlemen came up to him, and touched him, it was a darkish night, foggy, and I saw nothing that he had about him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he standing when you came up to me? - He was standing up when I first saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you or they see him first? - I should suppose that they saw him first, because they were making over the foot path, and I was over right to them.</p>

O, says he, these gentlemen have taken me up, but I don't know what for. Croker says, what are you known in this public house? yes, says he, I am known here; O, then, says he, take up the iron and walk about your business, I suppose it is only to get you a pot of beer; they were both present when he said this.</p>
               <p>Court to Croker. Did you see that witness near? - Yes, he was, and he followed us into the public house.</p>
               <p>Q. When you stopped the prisoner did you see him then? - Yes, he was about five or six yards off, he was standing pretty near.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say? - I asked him who he was, and and where he was going? he said he had been easing himself; but I did not perceive any thing of that; but we went afterwards to see if there were any more iron, with a candle and lanthorn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing of this sort pass which the last witness has affected? - It strikes my recollection that something did pass, I recollect the circumstance now. When I brought it in and laid it on the table; they knowing him I might say, why should I have so much trouble, does it belong to you? he said it did not, it is not my property, nor I will not have it.</p>

               <p>The way that I was robbed the prisoner had no place to sleep in, and I gave him a room to sleep in, and bedding for to sleep on. On the 28th of November at night he went up and down three times, the last time he went out about one o'clock at night, and did not come back, and I missed a shirt, a neck handkerchief, a pair of trowsers and seven shillings and six-pence in silver.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lose them from? - I was asleep at that time, the things were lost from the two pair of stairs, my own room.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see him taken? - I did, and got the officer to take charge of him, because of the handkerchief that he had on, which I swore to before justice Wickam, and the shirt I knew that was on him at the time he was taken, to be Mr. Brown's.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of the prisoner sleeping at Brown's? - The land lady of the house knows he was there, and Mr. Brown came and told me.</p>

               <p>Q. How came you to take him up? - I was sent for, I asked him how he came by the shirt and handkerchief? he said Mr. Brown gave them to him for doing some work for him; I asked him what he did with the trowsers and money? he said he knew nothing about the remainder of the things, but this shirt and handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Court to Brown. Did you ever give the prisoner any of these things? - No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He gave me the things to put on, he expected that his wife had given me something for some work I had done for them; as for the trowsers and money I know nothing about them.</p>

On the 6th of January I had orders to convey him with nineteen others making twenty in the whole, to Portsmouth; last Monday was a week we went with the coach, when I got about thirty-four or thirty-five miles, he was missing when I came to Farnham, I never missed him till I came to Farnham, for I was inside of the coach with six others; I believe Farnham is thirty-four or thirty-five miles, he went in what they call the basket, belonging to the stage coach, in the same coach in which I was, he with seven others, making eight in all were in that place, there was six on the roof, and six withinside with me; when I came to Farnham I went to give them a little beer, by way of nourishment, being a cold night, I found him and another missing, by examining their irons, I believe it was about one o'clock in the morning; I gave every possible alarm that I could at that time of the morning, I continued on the journey with the eighteen others, and delivered them safe.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you hear again from him? - On Sunday last one of the officers, that apprehended him, came and informed me that he had apprehended one of the people that got away from me, and I went to the New Prison, there I saw him; I have not the least doubt in the world but this is the same man.</p>

               <p>I am an officer belonging to the office of Shoreditch, in Worship-street; I was present when the prisoner was taken, we had a coach and took him down to New Prison that night.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they receive him there without a commitment? - Yes, I left him there as a night charge. On Monday he was carried before the magistrate, and on Sunday I went and informed Mr. Owen.</p>
               <p>Q. In what parish is this Rosemary-lane? - In Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. If you please to consider if any gentlemen had found opportunity to make their escape they would have done the same. The guard behind the coach was fast asleep, I made my escape with no other idea than to serve my Majesty, I asked before to go for a soldier, and the Recorder that tried me, would not grant it me, I went at first to Deptford, to go on board a King's ship, and they would not take me, and I went to Rosemary-lane, and enlisted for a King's soldier to go to the East Indies, I did not do it for any intent than to serve his Majesty, either by sea or by land.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose company did you enlist? - With Mr. Mozelle, I was taken out of his house, I was in bed when they came for me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. They don't enlist into any company, only for five years, to serve in the East India company's settlement, and under no particular officer.</p>
               <p>Court to Armstrong. Was he in bed? - Yes, he was with another man.</p>

            Tell me how you missed the property going over the Bridge? - There were four young fellows came several times about the cart, and two of them desired me to get off the pavement, and shoved me, this present young man, that is the prisoner, he made two or three attempts at the cask, I see him put his hand twice on a tub, and he took it away, when he took it away I pursued after him immediately, I saw him take it out of the cart; he took one cask, I immediately pursued after him, and took him by the collar, with the cask.</p>
               <p>Q. How did he hold the cask? - Between his arms and his breast.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the tub? - I left the tub, and took him across to the watch-house, I found it immediately, a man took care of it, and rolled it down to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who did you deliver the cask to? - To the constable of the night, the constable that I called for assistance brings it here.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know it was pork that the tub contained? has it been opened? - The proprietor is here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. The man never touched me till such times as he knocked me down,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150100"/>he knocked me down once, or twice, with the butt end of his whip? - I did not strike him till he struck me; because I would not let him have his liberty, he struck me and I was ill used by the rest.</p>
               <p>Court. What were the other men? did they try to assist him to get away? - They did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Ask him whether he ever saw me touch the tub or was nigh them? - I saw him take the tub, and took the tub from him.</p>

               <p>Court to Talbot. Did you miss two at that present time? - While I was taking care of the prisoner, the rest drove the cart away, and I lost one then entirely.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I was recommended to do a job in Westminster, I am a chair and cabinet maker, one of my shopmates told me he could tell me of a job in the Borough, I met some of my old shop-mates and we went and had three or four pots of beer, when I came over the middle of London Bridge, I heard the carman crying out thieves! thieves! thieves! I saw nobody, he runs and catches hold of me by the shoulders and beats me on the head with the whip, I asked him what he did with me? he never said any thing till such times as the watchman came up, then he sent me to the watch-house, I never saw the cart nor tub till it was brought into the watch-house; by my running across the way he catched hold of me by the coat; there is a good many in court that knows me, that I am a very hard working man.</p>
               <p>Merryman. I have had the care of the tub ever since; this is the tub that I took from the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It is impossible for me to lift this out of a cart, I am not such a strong man as to lift that tub up. I have not got a friend in court nor nearer than Birmingham. My Lord and gentlemen of the jury, I beg for a little mercy, I am innocent of the offence.</p>

               <p>I know the prisoner at the bar exceeding well, he was at my house three or four days before this last affair happened, he went on in such manner that I could not make out what he said, I had business to do with him, I have known him for five years, this last time he came and wanted me to give him money for a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150102"/>draft; he comes of a very respectable family; I am sure that young Spendelow must be out of his mind or stupified; that was two or three days before he was married to this unhappy woman.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I have known him for some time, he was at my house and put his horse up on the Monday that he was married on the Friday morning, he has been a customer to me for some time, I am an inn-holder in the City of London, he has been brought up a farmer, he always behaved in a very decent way when he came to my house; I have supplied him with cash for notes at various times. On Thursday he pushed me very hard for fifteen pounds, I denied him because I thought there was something in him not right, at different times he would go and sit down in different parts of my room and fall a crying, and tare his hair, and then he would come to me and want money; we missed him on the Friday night, on the Saturday morning he came into my house about eight o'clock in the morning and asked me for a horse; I let him have a horse, he said, he would go down in the country and see his wife's relations; on the Saturday morning his late wife came to my house and asked for Mr. Spendelow, the reply I made was that he was gone out of town; my wife informed her that Mr. Spendelow had gone down to see his wife's relations; she asked whether he had a wife? my wife replied that he had been married for upwards of four years; she says I was married to him yesterday; I said I am very sorry for it, but I don't think he is right in his mind; says she, I thought so, for he pinched me here, and he pinched me here, I never was served so before; I asked her how long she had known him? She said since Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>- STONARD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a cornfactor. I have known his father for a great number of years, and he naturally applied to me since he came into business for himself. I have very little to say to his character; I never heard any harm of him, and I have had reason to think that he was rather deranged, that he was not always as he should be.</p>

I told him, I would go and see; I went, and missed a pair of boots; he asked me, what sort they were? I told him; this was on the 2d, the Thursday; on the 4th, they came down to me, and told me, the man that was taken that offered the boots to fell, was at the office; I went down to the office. I saw the man there, and I saw my boots; the boots were in the hands of the officer, I don't know his name; they were a new pair of boots with three C's wrote behind in the leg of the boots.</p>

               <p>On the 2d of this month, the prisoner came to my shop with a pair of boots, and offered them me to fell. I am a shoemaker, in Rosemary-lane, near to Tower-hill. I told him, I thought, he did not come honestly by them; he said, they were his own property, I told him to call again on the Saturday following, and detained the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he come to you again on Saturday? - After that, I shewed them to a man that happened to know Mr. Plimpton, and he gave me his address.</p>
               <p>Q. What led you to think that the boots belonged to Mr. Plimpton? - His name was on the boots, and this man gave me Mr. Plimpton's address, and I went and asked him, if he had lost a pair of boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner come on Saturday to you? - He did, he came about eleven o'clock, as nigh as I can guess; I sent for a police officer, and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear the prisoner say how he came by them? - I don't recollect he did.</p>
               <p>Court to Plimpton. You missed these boots you say on the 2d of January. Did you miss them before Mr. Jones came to you? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon had you seen them before that time? - The morning before, the first of January, (New Year's Day).</p>
               <p>Prisoner. As I was coming down Houndsditch, coming towards Bishopsgate church, I picked them up in a bit of a bag. I am a silk-dresser by trade.</p>

               <p>Q. When had you last seen them in the jar? - About half an hour before I went off the bar.</p>

               <p>Were there a good number of halfpence, or only a few? - Before I went out of the bar the jar was about three parts full, it would hold forty shillings worth.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they wrapped up in any thing, or laid loose in the jar? - Loose in the jar.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say with respect to the prisoners? - When I went out of the bar, my husband was called out of it too, and there were seven of them altogether in the bar drinking.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who called him out? I believe it was the distiller's clerk, and when he came in, he missed the jar of halfpence; he called me in, and I missed them, jar and all. I thought my husband had put them up somewhere; and when I could not find them, I charged all with it that were in the bar; the three prisoners and four more were there, when I went out of the bar, they were there, when I went in again, they were in their own house; I charged the officer with them.</p>

               <p>Q. To what amount, were they found in her pocket? - I cannot tell. After searching their pockets, there were some found on the floor, between the chairs in which they were sitting, and the duplicate of a petticoat which they had pawned that day.</p>
               <p>Q.

               <p>Q. Did you find any quantity of halfpence in the house? - None; the constable stopped down, and under some coals in the coal hole, he took out a table cloth, and I said, it was mine; it was a linen dinner table cloth, it is here. (Produced.)</p>
               <p>Court to officer. Where did you find that? - In the coal-hole under the stairs, by the side of the fire place; it has been in my possession locked up ever since, in the same state and condition in which I found it; it is marked, J. P. No. 3.</p>

My master took it up, and looked at it; she brought a stuff gown, and one blanket, she did not offer to pledge them; she offered to pledge one sheet, but she brought a pair. I stopped her; there was an officer sent for, and never a one came; the woman stopped of her own accord in the shop; there was a little boy went for an officer, and never a one came; he went of his own accord, because he saw an uproar.</p>
               <p>Q. Then the woman was in your shop, and she was not detained by you? - No. A woman came, and told us not to take<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150108"/>them in, for she had stolen them; it was one

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of December last, Thursday, I was standing at the office door in Lambeth-street, Whitechapel, there was a mob of people bringing the prisoner up, and they told me to take charge of her. I asked, what she had been doing? and they told me; and I was told where the property was; I went to the pawnbroker's, and he desired me to take the property away, as they had not taken it to pledge; it was that boy, (John Dillon) that gave me the property. I have kept it ever since; here are two sheets, one blanket, and one gown.</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. The woollen blanket is mine, I bought it, and paid for it, there is no mark on it. I can swear it to be my blanket, because it is mine; I lost it that day and hour; the sheets are mine; my name is not on them; I can swear them to be mine. The gown is my own, I have wore it; I put it out to be forebodied, and sleeved, it is mine, I can swear to it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. All that I have got to say, is I lodged with this woman, and I was to pay a shilling a week for my lodging; my husband went to sea from me about a month ago, and I fetched these things to lay on the floor, them two sheets and blanket; and I being out in the country for a month, and when I came back, she would not give me the things; she had a guinea of mine, and I could not get the money from her; and so I was a little in liquor, and I went and took the things, as she would not let me be there. The pawnbroker seeing I was in liquor, he had some suspicion of me; so there was a croud gathered together about me, and alarmed, and made a piece of work, that I stole these here things; and this woman comes and owns these things, that they were her's. I had things taken from me by that woman several times. She took a linen gown from me, that I gave seven shillings and six-pence for, in Rag Fair, and she gave me that old gown there to put on, which is all tore. I being a stranger, she wanted to do me out of every thing that I had.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Skinner. I never saw her in my life with my eyes, till I saw her in the pawnbroker's. I never knew her husband, nor she.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Before I had these things of her, I took off my cap from my head and handkerchief off my neck, and gave to her.</p>
               <p>Court to Buckney. Are you acquainted with Mrs. Skinner at all? - No, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you happen to know any thing of this woman or her husband? - I am entirely a stranger.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have got no friend in the world except God almighty and myself.</p>

               <p>Q. By whose directions were these nails made? - By my own, I furnished the pattern to the surveyor.</p>

            Who were the founder that cast them? - Mr. James Burrows in Houndsditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at this time in your service or not? - He was as a labourer slator. When I went to look into this tool house, I found about ten pounds more or less in this bag.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they all the two inches and a half sort or were they mixed? - Mixed, with large ones at the bottom.</p>
               <p>Q. With how many forts were they mixed? - Three, it was a bag that was kept on purpose for long nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it an unexpected thing by you to find three forts in this bag? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did that excite any suspicion? - I cannot say it did at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the other fort of nails kept? - In tubs. The bag was put on the top of the tub; I had the other witness with me that saw them, I then gave him a note to go to Mr. Burrows for half an hundred more of two inch and a half, and two inch, and inch and a half; I went home then, all the men had come out of the yard except the prisoner, the remainder part of the men went home with me, the prisoner stayed behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner there or did you only suppose that he stayed behind? - I only supposed that he stayed behind, I saw all the others leave work, he was on the premises at that time, I left him on the roof when I came down from the roof, before I left the premises, if he had gone out of that yard he must have come through a door that I must have seen him; I received some information that evening, I got up at five o'clock the next morning, and was in the Church-yard just as the clock struck six, that was before the workmen came to work, then I went into the tool house as soon as the doors was opened, and I searched the tool house and found the bag missing with its contents, I waited there till half past seven when I saw the prisoner coming with a bag in his hand in the old Church-yard, I went to him, as soon as he saw me, he had the bag in his right hand, he put it between his great coat and his little coat, this was as soon as he saw me, before I could get up to him; I then asked him what he had got there? He said nothing; I then took the bag from behind him and I asked him what he had done with the nails that were in it last night? he said he had not taken any thing with it but a bit of mortar.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got possession of the bag was you able to say whether it was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150110"/>the same bag that you kept in that place? - Positive, I made it myself it was one that was cut of a large one that was wore out, and we cut the large ones up and make smaller ones of them as they wear out; I then took him to a public house to get an officer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing at that time? - He denied it strictly, still persisted; I then left him there, I was not willing to be troubled with a tedious prosecution, that he might go away, and I went on to the church, in about half an hour afterwards he came up towards the building, he there b-st-d my eyes and limbs, and swore that he would prosecute me for taking away his character; I then took him back to the public house again and I then sent for an officer, I then when the constable came, gave him his choice either to go into the cage or to go home about his business, and send his wife at night and I would pay her, and never let me see his face any more, to do which he liked; he then said he would be damned if he would not see himself righted, then he was put into the cage till eleven o'clock, and he was taken before the bench of justices in Worship-street, he was there committed for re-examination but was taken into a public house adjoining to the office.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the magistrate was any thing said to him advising him to confess, that it would be better for him? - There were not. He was taken in custody of the officer to the public house, when I was going away, he then said that he had got something to say to me, he had been examined before.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him to frighten him into a confession of his guilt? - I asked him to turn evidence against the man where he sold them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you desired him to confess, or made him any promise? - No, nothing.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp here objected to going into the evidence of the prisoner's confession but was overruled by the court.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say? - He said he had never sold any; he then was taken into the little room and the magistrate was there, he confessed before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>Q. Was what he said before the magistrate taken in writing or not? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the magistrate make him any promise of favour? - Not that I heard and I was in the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think if he had you should have heard it? - I am sure I should. He there confessed to taking three pounds of nails.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the words? - Them were the words, and he likewise told the justice where they were at his lodgings. the officer and I and the prisoner went to the lodgings, but I did not go up, we went by his own directions where he pointed out.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were the lodgings? - I really cannot tell; I went within five or six yards of the door; the officer went up and the prisoner went up with the officer.</p>

               <p>Q. Was there any thing brought out of that. house? - Three pounds two ounces of nails and other things, the officer brought them out and the prisoner with him, the officer has got the nails, the officer then requested of me to go up into the room likewise, I went up and he searched the room, and he charged me to aid and assist him to take him back to the office, when he was committed for reexamination on Monday, when he was finally committed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. I take it for granted you employed a great many workmen in this slating of Hackney Church? - Yes, sometimes more and sometimes less.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150111"/>Q. How many at this time? - I believe there might be eight persons at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that you furnished the pattern of the nail that you have described? - I filed the nail up and I took it to Mr. Burrows that he might cast me a certain quantity according to that sample.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a nail maker? - I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in them? - I deal in them when I buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal in them as a manufacturer of nails? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You then employ of course a person dealing in that trade for the purchase of them? - Yes, I buy them of the founder.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you been a slater? - Fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have roofed many churches before this time? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps you have used the same sort of nails? - No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this was a new scheme of your own to try these sort of nails? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. Not being a manufacturer of nails you will not say that other manufacturers of nails might not have the same sort of nails? - When the founder is here he will prove that he cast them; I did not tell you that I made them.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so angry? Will you take on yourself to say that other manufacturers of nails might not have some of the same quality that you charge to have lost? - I verily believe that they have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if nail manufacturers are here, and will produce nails of the same quality, and exactly similar to your own, you will be surprized? - No, I shall not.</p>
               <p>Q. I like that answer extremly well, with respect to the bag, how long might you have had that bag belonging to you? - About six months or more.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it is made out of a large bag? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What purpose is this bag for? - To take nails in smaller quantities for smaller jobs.</p>

               <p>Q. Now this bag with the nails, you saw in a corner of the shed, the night before? - I said, it was on a sirkin in the shed.</p>
               <p>Q. And you looked in there and saw ten pounds of nails? - I did not look in, Burn took it out of the tub and gave it to me, I saw the nails.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, seeing this, it created no suspicion in your mind? - No, none at all.</p>
               <p>Q. You stated just now to the court that it was unusual to put these sort of nails in the bag, did it not surprise you to see a quantity of these nails in a bag on a sirkin? - No, it did not at all.</p>
               <p>Q. That bag was in the use of taking a quantity of nails out of the tub and carrying upon the roof? - It was employed for taking large nails only.</p>
               <p>Q. Now with respect to this bag, has it never happened to you to lend this bag to workmen for any purpose whatever? - Never in my life.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner at the bar never borrowed this bag for any purpose? - Never, he has a bag of his own.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he never borrowed the bag in the question? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. You say that the prisoner before the magistrate stated what you have said, by way of confession, that he had taken three pounds weight of nails, was your examination reduced to writing<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150112"/>before the magistrate? - For what I know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you sign something? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you know very well it was taken down, why did you trifle with the jurors time in this way, as your examination was taken down in writing, and the other witnesses, was not the examination of the prisoner, that you have been talking to my learned friend, taken down in writing? - I cannot tell whether it was or not, I will not swear either way, I don't know that it was, I did not see it wrote.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by daring to say that it was not taken in writing? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean that you believed it was not taken down in writing? - I signed a paper myself, but whether there was any thing else more than what I signed, I know not, it might be taken down, for any thing I know, and it might not.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you mean by telling my lord that you believed that it was not taken in writing, on that presumption my lord took the confession as part of the evidence against the prisoner; both times when you was before the magistrate, was there any examination of the prisoner taken down in writing? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether there was not? - I did not see any of his consession.</p>
               <p>Q. The confession of the prisoner, will you swear that it was not taken down in writing? - I do believe it was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Will you swear positively? - I will, if the confession is what you mean.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you mean to swear positively that there was not any confession taken down of the prisoner? - I did not see any writing, and from that I should naturally suppose that there was none.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe there were other persons suspected of this as well as the prisoner? - Not to my knowledge, never, not in stealing of the nails, but I have of lead.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner told you where to go to his lodgings? - He keeps two different lodgings, he went with me by the desire of the justice.</p>
               <p>Q. He complied with that desire, and shewed you his lodgings, where these nails were found; the very next day he brought the bag back to Hackney Church; you know; you took it from him? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. There were three sorts of nails described to be in this bag, do you mean to swear to the others as well as to the two inch and half nails? - I should not have sworn to them, if it had not been for his uncle.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This person first of all went through a regular examination before the magistrate? - He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any writing going forward at all? - No, only the clerk wrote a paper, which I signed after they were all gone away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any writing going forward at that moment that he gave his confession? - There was not.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know whether he went away with the rest of the workmen, or whether he stayed behind? - He stayed behind, I mean the day before he was taken up.

            Perhaps you are not much acquainted with nails? - I am not.</p>

               <p>Q. How many sorts are there? - Three sorts.</p>
               <p>Bates. They are the three samples of nails that I used at Hackney, the large ones for the large slates, and the other for different size slates, I have not the least shadow of a doubt about the others.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you swear to that sort by the size or composition? - By the size.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you looked at the bag? - I have; it is mine, I know it by the fringe and make of it, there is no particular mark on it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You swear to the make and fringe. It is a square bag, like any common workman's bag? - No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Court. Is it common in the ordinary business for these bags to be taken home by the workmen? - No, They are made to carry certain samples of nails up on the church, as we went on with the business.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing to say particular; I leave it all to my counsel. My master said that I was the last left in the building; there were twenty men at work after I left the building, of stone masons and carpenters; we were always the first that leaved the building.</p>
               <p>Court to Bates. Was there any men left on the building after your men came down? - There were no men of mine, but there were other peoples men.</p>

               <p>Q. You have been employed by the last witness, Mr. Dyson? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bates has been describing to the jury some nails that you cast particularly to a pattern of his? - I made him some nails to a direction, a two and a half nail.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that peculiar to Mr. Bates? - Mr. Bates had the first, and Mr. Dyson had some since, and Mr. Roberts had some since; that is all I have made of that pattern.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any nails that you would take upon you on your oath to swear to? - I know them that I made, but whether I sold them to Mr. Bates, Dyson or Roberts, I cannot swear.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You have only sold three parcels that you made to Mr. Bates's pattern? - Yes, last Wednesday I sold a small quantity besides.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Bates and Dyson, to whom you sold another small parcel to, buys them for the purpose of using in his trade? - I should suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Mr. Roberts use them in his trade, or buy them to sell? - For his trade.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My master took his oath before the justice, that them were not the nails that were missing that night, and he valued them nails at six-pence before the justice.</p>
               <p>Court to Burn. Did the bag appear full or empty when you saw it in the prisoner's hand? - Full.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I live at Wainbridge, in Cornwall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you an officer in the excise there on the 20th of June last? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had you been in that part? -  About two years and a half at Wainbridge, or near to that.</p>
               <p>Q. On that day you had information, I believe, of a cutter being on the coast? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who went with you? - Mr. Haynes, an officer of Port Isaac.</p>
               <p>Q. An officer of the excise? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner at the bar, Mr. Hawkey? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time did you set out for the coast? - About ten o'clock at night.</p>
               <p>Q. In your way did you see any body that you knew? - I saw a person that Mr. Haynes told me to be Mr. Hawkey.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not know him at that time? - This happened in the night; I tried to be undiscovered to them.</p>
               <p>Q. When you got to the Beech what did you observe? - Five horses loaded with anchors farther out. The Beech is a large place. There were other horses nearer the Sea, these five horses we attempted to seize.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way were they loaded with anchors? - The anchors had ropes so fastened on each side of the horse.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you attempted to seize these five horses, what happened then? - Mr. Haynes ordered one of them, a man that he knew, one Skiller, to drive them on; he said he should wait for his copartners; with that they gave a shouting. We were together at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. How many persons were there? - I suppose there must be fifty at least, a large number of men and horses. Then they began to throw stones at us, one of these, a large stone, struck me on the side of the head, and nearly fetched me off my horse, it broke my head; we then rode off, we were obliged to turn about to the right, and they kept throwing stones all the while till we got out of their reach on the top of the hill, where we saw the boat plying to and fro from the cutter; as soon as they came in they gave three shouts; we stayed about an hour; I do not immediately recollect to a few minutes, watching the cutter, to see if any single horse should come up, and we be able to seize them; in the mean while two persons came creeping up to where I was, and I thought it was proper then to ride off, and I rode off; we then rode off to about five hundred yards; we saw a quantity of men coming down a field, we thought they were running after us; instantly, there came a cloud of stones, such as they cover the houses with, flat tiles, a stony slate. I made a little longer turn than Mr. Haynes, I was nearly caught by one of these people; but by one means or another, I escaped; the stones were throwing all this time; we then got off to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150119"/>distance of two miles for this place, I don't say exactly to a few yards, where we lay in a ditch for the course of an hour, till at length we saw five and twenty horses come by; I told twenty-five horses, to the best of my knowledge and belief; and we stayed till they were gone past us, we thought it madness to make a seizure among twenty-five.</p>
               <p>

            Were they laden? - Yes, with anchors, and men on them; as soon as they were gone by, we thought it proper to go a little nearer, to see where they would deposit the goods. As soon as we came to the distance of about five hundred yards, I don't know exactly to the number of yards, I imagine that distance. We saw a quantity of persons coming back and horses not laden, galloping back towards the wreck; we tried to make our escape, by some accident, Mr. Haynes's hat slew off, consequently, he was discovered. I, at this time, got into a ditch to conceal myself, because they should not see me; and I saw, I suppose, ten or a dozen of these persons riding after Mr. Haynes, saying, blow his brains out, riding as fast as they could after him; they followed him, and I saw no more of Mr. Haynes; then I laid in that ditch for about it might be half an hour, or something thereabouts; then I thought the road all clear of smugglers; I got out, and went a little way on the road after the smugglers still, further than where Mr. Haynes and me were before, expecting to see where they had dropped the goods. In the mean while, Mr. Hawkey, the person at the bar, and some other person came galloping on the road from the beech; these two persons had no goods with them; as soon as I saw these two persons, my idea was, that it was to look out where the officers were. I went into a neighbouring field adjoining the lane, expecting to get out of their way, that I would not be discovered; Mr. Hawkey, by some means or other, saw me go in, and followed me into a ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you out of the road? - I went out of the road as soon as I saw these persons, they followed me out of the main road into the field, and into a ditch. I ran into the ditch as soon as I saw them follow me; as soon as Mr. Hawkey came up, he had a pistol in his hand, saying, that he would do something, blow my brains out, or something to that purpose; so I desired him to spare my life, then he immediately put up his pistol again into his left-hand pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you when he presented his pistol to you, and threatened you, did he give you any reason for threatening you? - He said, he would teach me to look after brandy, that was the expression.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you said any thing to him before he pulled his pistol out? - I was trying to conceal myself in the ditch. I did not see him pull the pistol out, he had it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. After he put up his pistol, what did he do? - With a bludgeon that he had in his hand, he struck at me, but he missed me in the ditch.</p>
               <p>

            Describe what sort of a bludgeon that was? - It was a large club, such as smugglers carry about, three or four feet long; a common bludgeon, that they ride with.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a stump, or was it a whip? - No, it was a club, a large stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Larger at one end than at the other? - No, it was a large thick stick, whether it was as big as my arm I cannot say, I had it not in my hand; the next blow he struck me on the head, with this same stick.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your head covered at that time? - I had my hat on, and my handkerchief under it. That blow almost deprived me of my senses, it was a very<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150120"/>severe blow, it was the severest I received; the first blow I did not receive, he sitting on his horse, he did not get off his horse at all, nor did the other person; I received the second blow after I came out of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to come out of the ditch? - Mr. Hawkey ordered me out of the ditch.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed after this second blow? - Then he ordered me back into the road from whence I came, he struck me several blows in the way, but I got under my horse's neck to save myself, after receiving such a violent blow; as he was on his horse he could not come at me so well, I received one on my left arm, I was lamed in it, but as it was my left arm it did not hinder my writing, but I felt the effects for some weeks, at least I was able to hold my book on it, there was no great strain, but I felt it very severely for about three weeks, I did not decline my business on account of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What past in the road? - He then struck me again, and ordered me on my horse, I was off my horse all this while.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the other man? - He came up and struck me also, but I did not know that person, the other person did not strike me in the road, he struck me in the field, before I came into the road; as soon as I got up on my horse he told me which way to go, towards the beech.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that in a contrary direction to where the anchors were carried up? - It was; as soon as I got through the gate I turned about, and said I should find out his name, I said that to Mr. Hawkey; he then said my name is not Knapman, wishing he had Mr. Haynes, the other officer that was with me, that he should share the same fate, that was the expression as near as I can recollect; I then rode off towards the beech, I saw no more of Mr. Hawkey that day; I rode then to Port Isaac, from that place, and waited at Port Isaac till Mr. Haynes came, which I suppose was an hour or two, I cannot be positive to half an hour, to consult about the business, what we were to do in this matter, the next day I saw Mr. Hawkey at Wainbridge, there was a fair there that day, Mr. Newelling the supervisor was with me, I said to Mr. Newelling, there is the man that used me so ill yesterday, and Newelling and I went to look for him, we did not see him after that day.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the man? - I am confident, I had seen him before, I have not the least doubt in my mind, I am as confident of it as I stand here, because it was by day-light that this circumstance happened.</p>
               <p>Court. About what time was it this happened? - It was between three and four in the morning, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. Was it light? - It was light the whole night, but it was quite day-light, as light as it is here now. As soon as we had consulted at Port Isaac what to do, I set off to Bodwin, to acquaint my supervisor of the business, he was not at home, there was a messenger dispatched for him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go afterwards in pursuit of the cargo? - Yes, Mr. Newelling and myself and five others; I think it was about six or seven in all went to the place where I supposed they had dropped the goods, we then found four anchors, and at some little distance we found eleven more.</p>
               <p>Q. How many gallons did you find on this occasion? - Mr. Newelling took the account.</p>
               <p>Q. In short you made the seizure? - We did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you examine what sort of spirits they were? - I left my supervisor to examine what it was, my supervisor thought it prudent to secure these fifteen<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150121"/>anchors; I was then dispatched to Padstow for some soldiers, I rode off immediately to Padstow, while I was at Padstow I don't know what happened.</p>
               <p>Q. When the soldiers came was there any firing that happened? - While I was away I saw nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time afterward see Hawkey? - Yes, I saw him not very soon after, five or six months it may be for what I know; at Saintaff, we were talking the business over, I was saying what was their idea for trying to surround us, I was mentioning of it to the people, Hawkey was by, he said they intended the putting us on board the ship, and carrying us to Guernsey, he said it was very fortunate we got off, or something to that purpose.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he apprehended? - I don't know the day of the month.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you personally informed your supervisor immediately? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. After all this story you have been telling us, I would ask you this one qestion, all this time at the beech did you see Mr. Hawkey at all? - I did not see him at the beech, he was not at the beech at this time, that I know of.</p>

            Then all that passed was in his absence as far as you know; this took up a considerable time, and you have told us the different stages of it; you was two miles from the beech? - It must be, from the distance of ground.</p>
               <p>Q. And there you saw some men with horses loaded, and there you did not see Mr. Hawkey? - He might be there, but I did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. I am satisfied with your answer you did not see him. The first time you see Mr. Hawkey, was when all this was done, and he was coming into his own field? - It was not his own field, it belongs to the parish of St. Hugh; the hedge parted the two parishes.</p>
               <p>Q. You knew where he lived I believe, and he was going towards his own house, and not in a direction from his own house to the beech? - He was coming from the beech, whether he was going towards his own house I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. What distance was it from his own house? - I suppose it must be three miles I believe, I don't know exactly the distance.</p>
               <p>Q. During this whole transaction did you see Mr. Hawkey with any of these people, that you have been talking about? - I did not with the first persons with anchors, nor with those persons on the beech.</p>
               <p>Q. You know Mr. Hawkey, he is a farmer there, he is not a smuggler? - I suppose him to be a smuggler.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore of course you know to constitute this offence with which Mr. Hawkey is charged with, you must make it part of the smuggling transaction, that you have told us of? - He told me he would teach me to look after brandy.</p>
               <p>Q. You don't mean to separate the assault from the smuggling? - I thought Mr. Hawkey to be the master of them, which I believe he really was.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you believe so? - I heard so from a number of different persons.</p>
               <p>Q. And so you was so long before you indicted him, it was not because you could not take him out of his house?</p>
               <p>Court. It does not depend on him, when an offence against this act of parliament is indicted? - I can tell that from experience.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. However in point of fact, it was that distance of time? - What time?</p>
               <p>Q. Who was with you the next day when you saw him? - The supervisor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any attempt to take him there, he was there alone? - I passed him in the street, and I said to the super<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150122"/>visor, that is the person that used me so ill, yesterday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not occur to you then to take hold of him? - I did not know the rules and orders of the business, afterwards Mr. Newelling and me went to look after him, and we did not see him.</p>
               <p>Q. This transaction between you and Mr. Hawkey took place not only two miles from the place, but likewise half an hour after the place was clear of smugglers? - It might be half an hour, I lay in the ditch, I expected all the men were by at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then when Mr. Hawkey and the other came up, they see you concealed in a ditch? - No, they saw me in the road, I got out of the road on purpose to avoid being seen.</p>
               <p>Q. You endeavoured to escape them, and they followed you, endeavouring to hide yourself, they found you in the ditch, and then Mr. Hawkey took a pistol and told you to come out? - He had it in his hand when I saw him, I thought myself in danger, and so I ran away as fast as I could.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you said to him spare my life, I am doing no mischief, he put up his pistol immediately? - He did into his left hand coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you venture to swear what Mr. Hawkey's expressions were? - It was something about blowing out my brains, and he would teach me to look after brandy.</p>

            Was this spoke first or not? - He was swearing all the way on.</p>

            Whether he said these words you do not know or do you know? - I do not know what he said besides, I don't know because he was talking as he came on.</p>
               <p>Q. You never had any difficulty about his person? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. And he must equally know that it must be impossible to hide himself from you, it being so light? - My idea told me that he supposed I did not know him, because I had never seen him before, that was my idea of the business.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was there any road through the field, or the ditch to his own house? - No, there was not.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. You are an officer of the excise, at Port Isaac, was you in company with Knapman, on the 20th or 21st of December? - I was.</p>
               <p>Q. You went in consequence of some information, in company with Mr. Knapman? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. When you was going down towards the beech did you meet any body? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Who? - Mr. Hawkey.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr. Hawkey's person? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know his person before that time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you met him on the road, as you was going down to the beech? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. He was coming from the beech? - I suppose so.</p>
               <p>Q. When you went down to the beech what passed under your immediate observation? - As I was going down to the beech there were several horses.</p>
               <p>Q. After you had seen Mr. Hawkey on the road whereabouts was that, as to its distance from the beech? - I suppose it might be about two miles, or two miles and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night? - About eleven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. And he past on, and you went on towards the beech, when you came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150123"/>the beech what was doing? - We found several horses loaded with anchors, and a multitude of people there.</p>
               <p>Q. They were loading the horses with anchors at that time? - Yes, when we came among them, we saw five horses stood out from among the rest, and I knew the man Skiller that was with them, I called him, and told him to drive them on, but I am informed since that he was not there, but he answered to that name when I called him, I ordered him to drive the horses on, the answer he gave me was, that he waited for his copartners.</p>
               <p>Q. What said you, or did you after this? - I struck the horses with my stick, in order to drive the horses on, I thought there were so many behind that we should have no mercy; the other party see us, and perceived who we were, and they directly began to give a cheer, and after that the stones played about us, and we fled for our lives, we rode off to escape for our lives.</p>
               <p>Q. How far did you go before you stopped? - I suppose about five hundred yards, out of the way of the stones, we went up towards Port Isaac, where I resided, when we got up on the higher ground we perceived a vessel stood at anchor, and a boat was going to and fro, I suppose we might stay there for half an hour, or nearly an hour; while we were there we saw two men above us, in a high field, looking over a hedge, they were higher than we were by twenty yards, and we thought if they threw stones from there we should be knocked of the head, we immediately returned away, towards Port Isaac, on our return I makes a motion for Knapman, that we would see who them men were, we had not seen them before, then we opened the gate, Knapman did, and I was going to ride into the field, where these men were, when we opened the gate we perceived, I suppose, nearly a score, were on the top of the field, which was above us still, as soon as they saw me they made directly for us, as fast as they could, my partner was off his horse, I was not, I said get up, get up, we must be off again, and they were very near catching us, being above us; however we got off, and they followed us with stones to a great distance, the stones might injure the horse, but they did not injure me, we were afraid of going into the town, least the mob should follow us, therefore we went into the country about two miles off, we went and secured ourselves in a place where we should not be discovered, waiting there, we saw about twenty-five horses going along, all loaded; we lay still for a little time, till they passed us, after we made an observation that we would see when the roads led one way and another, we would see whether they would disperse, that we might follow a little party, and stand a chance of taking them, we thought also that we might stand a chance of seeing where they might deposit it; we went for about, I believe, twenty or thirty, or forty yards, I cannot tell how far, before we discovered several men coming against us.</p>
               <p>Q. Not loaded? - They were not, Knapman, he returned back and he said, here they be coming, he rides back.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you two separated? - Yes, I endeavoured to ride back too, I thought if we both were not able to stand them, one was not; in riding back the wind blew against me, my hat flew off, it was a round hat, and when it was on, it more concealed me from their observation; I dismounted my horse and got off and picked my hat up again, in the mean time while they were nearly on me, however when I got through the gate they had the same difficulty of getting through the gate as I had, I got the advantage of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you recovered your horse and got your feet? - They then followed me and swore that they would knock me down, and some of them said they would<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150124"/>blow my brains out, these expressions prevailed among them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go away then? - I was riding for my life all the while, there were ten or a dozen, I suppose pursuing me, I cannot say exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Now you had missed Mr. Knapman before this? - I never saw him after my hat blew off, for about two hours afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you see him again? - I suppose it was four or five o'clock, thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met him in what situation was Knapman then, what appearance had he? - He had the appearance of being much frightened, and beat, I could not see any wound, but he said that he was much beat, I cannot say any more, my observations were such.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you went together to the supervisor? - We went home, I being much frightened, my brother officer he went to the supervisor.</p>
               <p>Q. When you met Hawkey on that night on the road had you any doubt of his person then? - Yes, I had, when I met him I thought there was some business doing on the road.</p>
               <p>Q. When you saw him did you know him? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I only ask you whether you have any doubt about his person? - No, I had no doubt of him then.</p>

               <p>Court. Had you frequently seen him before? - O,yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Fielding. When you came where the goods were deposited did you find any arms? - We found goods in three separate places.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you together when you found the goods? - We found arms in the last place, there was a fowling-piece, and what they call a swivil, a piece that they take on board, it is larger than a blunderbuss, it had a thing to run into a part of the vessel, to keep it steady, I tried it, and found it was very heavy loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way? - I cannot say, the soldiers fired it off when we went to get carriages to take the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear loaded? - It was very heavy loaded, I tried it with the ramrod.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Knapman able to go about his business as usual? - We reside eight miles apart, therefore we do not sometimes see one another for six or seven weeks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. We are to understand from your evidence that the first time you saw Mr. Hawkey was on the road that night, how far was it you saw him from the beech? - About two miles, or two miles and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe during the whole business, until you saw him and another person, when you was in the ditch you never saw him at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then from the time that you met him in the road till the time Mr. Knapman complained of, you never saw him at all? - Never.</p>

I told him I had not, he asked me if I would let him see them? I looked in the window for them, where I had seen them the same morning, but they were gone, I then went and asked my wife and children, if either of them had disposed of them in my absence? they told me they had not, Mr. Packer told me there was a man detected for stealing a table cloth at the White Horse inn, at Uxbridge, and at the top of his bundle he had a set of weights, which he thought he saw at my house; the next day I heard the prisoner was to be examined. And I can prove the weights, I saw the weights produced before the magistrate, the weights are here.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am constable of Uxbridge. On Tuesday the 7th of January I stopped the prisoner, between the hours of two and three in the afternoon, being sent for by Mr. - , of the White Horse, to take the prisoner into custody for stealing a table cloth; after I had the prisoner in custody, he informed me he had a bundle at the Chequer inn, at Uxbridge, I went with the prisoner to the Chequers, the landlady there said that was the man that had left the bundle, and it was produced to me, the bundle was not tied up very tight, the prisoner tied the bundle up, and gave it into my care; I immediately put a string about the bundle, and sealed them up with a seal, and they were in my custody till they were had before the magistrate; the next day before the magistrate I opened the bundle, wherein was contained a quantity of things, such as a brass flower drudger, a brass candlestick, one set of brass weights, and a number of other things, the set contains seven weights.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire of the prisoner how he came by these things? - When he was before the magistrate we enquired of him how he came by these things, he said he found them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When I came into Uxbridge I left my bundle at the sign of the Chequers, I untied my bundle, and left it untied; ask him where he found the bundle? - When you went to the Chequers inn, it laid on the dresser.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. It was moved from the place where I left it.</p>
               <p>Court. Did the prisoner see the brass weights? - I did not see the brass weights in the bundle, they were tied up in this cloth, and delivered to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Mason. What time of the day was the prisoner at your house? - Between one and two in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is your house from the Chequers that Harman has spoken to? - About two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray is the person that keeps the Chequers here? - No. These brass weights they are my property, I have had them a great while by me, I have taken notice on the pound weight there is marked sixteen ounces, avoirdupois; I believe them to be mine, by having them so long by me, and often having them<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150126"/>in my hand, there is no other mark but what is common, on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. One weight is like another, and I have had them almost three years, I am a gingerbread-baker by trade.</p>
               <p>Mason. I can very safely say they are my weights.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I used to go to markets and fairs, and I have had occasion for weights and scales ever since I left Woodstock, I have been absent from there some time, I was in business there upwards of twenty-five years, but affairs did not go on as well as I could wish; I know two gentlemen, Mr. Sangster in Milk-street, Cheapside, and Mr. Peters in the Borough; I never said that I found them weights, I said I found the other things.</p>

               <p>On Thursday, December the 12th, I had been in town, to Beech-street, I had been to partake of an annual dinner; coming home I was stopped at the corner of <placeName id="t17940115-47-crimeloc250">York-street, Covent-garden</placeName>

               <p>Q. Have you ever seen your watch? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen your watch? - I had examined my watch coming out of the Fountain, to see whether I had the glass side or the other side outward.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you feel her take it away? - I see her hand something to the prisoner, and immediately I thought she had picked my pocket, I have not the least doubt but she did; I perceived her give something to the other woman, which she immediately ran off with, the prisoner was on the side in which the watch was kept, and when I stopped the prisoner she was by me, and the other woman was behind me; I am positive to the prisoner, for I took hold of her immediately.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was going along, and this gentleman hallooed out for a watch, and he laid hold of me, and no woman was in company with me, nor any body else; coming along he laid hold of me; I had witnesses, they were here to day, but they are gone home now.</p>

               <p>On the 17th of December, about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was going down the Strand towards Charing cross<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150129"/>I saw Peter Tilly, that was the prisoner's name, come out of the shop of Mr. Russel with something under his coat, instantly afterwards Mrs. Russel came out and cried stop thief! immediately I ran after the man and cried stop thief, and he threw the things down in the Adelphi; this might be forty or fifty yards from Mrs. Ruffel's house, I picked up the things and carried them to Mrs. Russel, and I left them there till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Russel. Have you had the care of the things ever since? - The constable has.</p>

               <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon on Tuesday the 17th of December, I was going to the Savoy, I saw the prisoner Ginks and the boy Low in deep conversation as they were walking along before me; the boy, Low, turns sharp on one side and went into a haberdasher's shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that Mrs. Russel's? - No, further on, I crossed the way and watched them, I followed them till they got beyond Mr. Russel's shop, then they turned about and there were three in company, Tilley, and Low, and Ginks, I saw them within twenty yards of Mr. Russel's shop, there came by at the time two or three coaches and carts; I did not see either of the prisoners go into the shop, but I presently heard the cry of stop thief! at that time I see the prisoners all run down one street, Adam-street, I saw them the minute I ran down after them, and I met Low and Ginks walking away, I stopped both and gave the prisoner Low into Mrs. Russel's hands, and defired her to bring him back and Tilley agreed to go back to the shop; he said he knew neither of the other two; they were all taken back and detained till the officer was sent for.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ginks. I would wish to know how near he was to us together? - I was close to them, I heard them say something about a shop, but what it was particularly I could not hear.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Low. I asked this young man which was the nearest way to the Savoy.</p>

               <p>Mrs. Russel. They are the only unmade goods in the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Tilley. I had been up to Paternoster-row, to the Gazette office, to know if a Gazette was out, I was going back, and I thought I would call at a customer's in the Adelphi, and I heard the cry of stop thief! and a sailor man came up to me and said, I must come back, for I had robbed the shop of some linen, and I was delivered into two or three peoples hands.</p>
               <p>Court. Who is your master? - Mr. Canton, he lives at No. 38, Charing-cross, he keeps the Gazette office.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Low. I went to see if I could find out my sister that lives in the Savoy, and I was coming along and I met this man, and I asked him which was the way to the Savoy? and he said he could not tell me, and I went into a shop and they directed me, and then I went strait on and I heard somebody halloo out stop thief! and I went to see what was the matter, and as I was going down that gentleman there came and laid hold of me, and said, I was along with them that robbed the shop.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Ginks. I work at chelsea, as I was coming from work Mr. Hicks came up to me and laid hold of me, Low had before come up to me and asked me the way to the Savoy, I told him I could not direct him, but the best way would be to enquire in at the shop; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150130"/>have no witnesses, I had people to appear for my character all the day, but they are just gone home to dinner.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you lose any sugar at any time? - On the 14th of December.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day of the week was it? - On Saturday about one o'clock in the day, about that time in the day I saw George Jenks, Brewer, says he, run up Ralph's Key for there are some boys plundering some hogsheads of sugar, in Young's Key-gateway; I ran up directly and stopped the prisoner at the bar in Young's Key-gateway, he was in the gateway when I stopped him, just at the top, I found some sugar concealed in his hat, and his hat concealed in his apron; I said what have you got there? He said nothing, and he dropped his hat on the ground; then we took him to the Dice at Dice Key, and sent for a constable and delivered him to the constable, we took the sugar with us and gave it to the constable, he has kept it ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you be certain at all to whom the sugar belongs? - It belongs to us while we have it in our charge.</p>
               <p>Q. How can you prove it is from this cask? -  Because there is a stave out of the middle of the outside cask.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this outside cask? - In Young's Key-gateway, part of the stave was out, not the whole of the stave, the mark of the cask was R. R. P. No 7, I know nothing more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any gone from the cask? - Yes, a quarter of a hundred, or more gone.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you take it back to the cask? - Directly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there more missing than what you found on the prisoner? - Yes, there were more boys.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any on any of the other boys? - I did not stop any more.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this sugar appear like the sugar in the cask? - I went afterwards and took a sample out of the same cask.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. When this gentleman came and took me I had not a bit of sugar about me, a gentleman asked me to go down for his horse and he would give me a penny, I went down for the gentleman's horse and this person came and took hold of me, he takes me to a public house and puts the sugar before me and said I had stole it; I know no more about the sugar than a child unborn.</p>

On the 11th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150133"/>of December last I put my cart up against a turnpike where it usually stands, and when I got up in the morning my cart was gone. I put it in the Curtain road behind the turnpike, it joins Old-street-road.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the day of the week? - Wednesday. I put it there as nigh as I can guess about ten o'clock on Thursday afternoon; the next day I went to get some sprats, and I saw two acquaintance who told me that they saw the axle tree, as they thought, to sell in Longalley. I went there, when I came there I looked at it, and I saw it was my axle-tree, it was at a broker's shop and iron shop together; it was to sell at the door, the man of the house was not at home, his wife was; when he came home I asked them how long he had that axle tree? he said he bought it last night. I sent for a constable and gave him charge of the axle tree and the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this shopkeeper recommend you to the prisoner? - Yes, they told me they lived at number 4, Long-alley, and I had the prisoner taken up the same evening about a quarter of an hour afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you find any thing else besides this axle tree? - Yes, I lost the wheels, they were found, but they were fresh painted; I could not swear particularly to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you miss the whole cart? - No, only the wheels and axle tree, the body of the cart was left behind, the two clinch pins were two nails.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you find the wheels? -  The officer found them.</p>

               <p>I am a police officer at Shoreditch. On the 12th of last month, the prosecutor came to the office and informed me that he lost a pair of wheels and iron axle tree, and that he had just seen the iron axle tree at an old iron shop; I went in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150134"/>company with Mr. Ferris to the old iron shop, he told me if it was his axle tree, there was a little hole in the end of the sides; on examining it there was a little hole, and I took the axle tree directly, and took it to the office; I asked Barr, who keeps the old iron shop, who he bought it of? he said he bought it of two hackney coachmen. I asked him if he knew where they lived? he said they lived at such a house, at No.4, I went immediately to this house with Mr. Ferris, I went and knocked at the door and asked the woman if such people lodged or lived in that house? She said yes, they had lodged there about a week ago, and had not been there since; says I, that will not satisfy me, I shall take the liberty of looking round your premises, and I went and looked round and I pushed against the door of the necessary, and I found it was fastened, and I pushed against it and opened it, and there I found both the prisoners concealed, I took them to the public house adjoining the office, and sent for the old iron man and he came; I have kept the axle tree ever since.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the wheels? - I asked the prisoners where they lodged, they told me at St. Giles's, I found that was not true, I could not find out the lodgings that night, the next morning there came an old man to the office to enquire after them, by that means I found out where they lodged; I and Mr. Ferris found a key on Smith, to the best of my knowledge Ferris found that was the key of their apartment, in Bolt-court, Shoreditch, we went there, and there we found in their apartment, two wheels fresh painted.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any body here that proves that to be there apartment? - Here is the man that lived there; the wheels were taken to the office, and they have been in my possession ever since; the prosecutor said he could not swear to them, being fresh painted, the paint was not dry on them, and they were searched up against the fire to dry, there had been a great fire to dry them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear either of the prisoners say that that was the key of the lodgings, that let you into the lodgings? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear either of the prisoners say whole lodgings they were? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they both present when the key was taken? - Yes, both of them, they were both together when the key was taken from them, we asked them whether that was not the key of their apartment? they said no, it was not; when the man that they took the apartment of came to the office, he said they both lodged there.</p>
               <p>Hewitson. I know this axle tree by a piece being chipped out by the side of it.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to make that observation, had you ever observed it before? - Yes, I had seen it before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about it? - It is my axle tree, I am sure of it.</p>

This Belfound was a Tinker, he was there, and this man Mr. Wilkes began telling me the story about his losing his money; he told me he had come from Rickmansworth fair, and that he had no dinner; that he had drank very much and was very drunk,and he did not want to go home till the man got up, and he was going over the Common to Beaumonts, he was about a quarter of a mile over he bethought himself that he should have some money about him, in his pocket or about him, and he felt in his pockets and could not find any money, so he returned back again and called at the house, and the people at the house let him in, and I don't know whether he went to bed or not, but he told me he was down two or three different times, in going down from the house to go home, after he had quitted the prisoner's house, and likewise his coat was all over dirt at the time, and he whispered to me that he thought Belfound must have the money, being that he was there the over night; I looked at this Belfound, and the man took notice of us, and he said, Mr. Wilkes, I hope you don't think that I have your money? and he said no, I cannot tell who had my money I was so excessive drunk.</p>

He said nothing but his own; I told him it was not his; he said it was his own property; with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150144"/>that I called stop thief, and when I tried stop thief, he threw down the copper, and ran, and I ran after him, the prisoner cried stop thief, as well as me.

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a shoe-maker; I was down at the sign of the Horse and Groom, having a pint of beer with some particular customers of mine, by and by I heard a terrible outcry in the street, crying stop thief! I immediately ran out of the tap room, and the prisoner was just run by, and ran into Black Horse yard, that leads into Tottenham-court-road; immediately I pursued him, I took him just coming into the Black Horse yard and brought him back to Mrs. Warren's; I was not the first that laid hold of him, but I was close to the heels of the gentleman that took him.</p>
               <p>Q. In what street does Mrs. Warren live? - In Steven-street, No. 13, it is in Rathbone-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you first see the copper? - It was brought into the baker's shop. When I saw him he had dropped the copper; I saw nothing of the copper till I came back with the prisoner to Mrs. Warren's, I did not know what was meant by the outcry before I came then the person that was the taking of him said, Gilpin, I will have nothing to do with him, you may take him to yourself, and I immediately sent for the watchman; Mrs. Warren said, that was the man that stole the copper, and said it was her own copper.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150145"/>Q. Did you go and see where it was taken from? - Yes, it was down in the kitchen, about ten or a dozen stairs, there were some of the lime broke off just about the edge where the copper was fixed.</p>
               <p>JOSHUA WHITEMAN sworn. I am a constable; I was the constable of the night; the prisoner was brought to the watch-house, and the copper was brought there, the last witness brought the copper.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Warren. Did you send it by the lab witness? - The witness took it himself.</p>
               <p>Court to Whiteman. Have you kept it from that time to this? - No, I put a mark on it, and they have had it for their own usesince.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Warren. How came it here? - Mr. Warren brought it here, two or three nights ago, and it has been over the way at the baker's ever since; I expected the trial to come on before now.</p>
               <p>Whiteman. This is the copper, here is the mark I put on it.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Warren. There is the mark I put on it, it is a scratch with a penknife, this is the one that I see the prisoner throw down.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I know no more than a child unborn about it.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Warren. Do you know this man at all? - He is quite a stranger to me.</p>
               <p>Court to Gunner. Are you sure that is the man that was in the passage? - I am.</p>
               <p>Court to Gilpin. Did you see any body else running besides this man? - No, there was nobody else in the street.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never saw the man that took hold of me first, from that day to this. My friends were here about an hour ago, and I thought I should not be tried to night. I have worked hard for my living ever since I have been able.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Counsel. You say this note was taken up by Whits and Rowley; don't you know the prisoner Pitt paid thirty pounds towards it, and Whits and Rowley consented to pay the rest? - To the best of my recollection it was so.</p>

               <p>Q. Had you any conversation previous to his leaving this house, on the subject of it? - No, only he told me he was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150151"/>going out of town, on backward state of his affairs; then he afterwards came on the Sunday morning, and waited till the Sunday night, he then went away again, and he stayed away till the next Sunday.</p>

               <p>Q. Can you fix with certainty the day that he went away first? - I can fix he was there only two nights after I went in.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Court. It is stated in the indictment to be the 21st, when he committed the act of bankruptey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. I think it is perfectly immaterial which is mentioned in the indictment, if it is after the act is committed, the same is in the case of an indictment for murder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. The indictment states it that he committed it on the 21st of August, and the witness has proved that he did not commit that act until the 23d of the month of August.</p>
               <p>Court. In the way the indictment is drawn it can be no objection.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I own this transaction is mentioned in the indictment under a perfectly satisfied with the court's judgment, but I am never satisfied with my own.</p>
               <p>Q. To Williams. Do you remember when the last witness came into your master's house? - The 20th of August.</p>

               <p>Q. How long was he absent when he went away the second time? - I cannot say how long he was absent; to the best of my memory, I saw him before he came home, I met him I believe the first time at the Green Man and Still.</p>

               <p>Q. When did you see him next after this time? - I see him almost every two days, after that at different places, not at his own house.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it before he returned to his own house? - I don't know that he was in it except of Sundays after he went.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember any application being made there during the time he was absent for any money? - Yes.</p>

               <p>Mr. Garrow to Court. I submit to your lordship that he cannot look at his ledger, I agree that he has a clear right to look at his own memorandum book.</p>
               <p>Beck. I have the original memorandum books here, and part of them are my own.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. I can have no objection to his looking at his own or any other that he knows the facts of his own knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Do you turn to your own memorandum books and see what is there writ down to Mr. Pitt's account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Will you be so good as to name the date of the first transaction and you must at present confine yourself to the joint debt of Hudson and Lowry? - It is all on the joint account, the separate account is all settled.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Have you any time delivered to Mr. Pitt a bill of parcels? - I have of goods that I sold him in his own shop.</p>

               <p>Q. To what amount can you say that you have delivered to him goods with bills of parcels? - I have applied to him to settle the account, the last account I settled with him was the first day of August, sixty-nine pounds, the bill was not paid, that was the only sum that was due, there were various other sums that were not due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any other time apply to him for the payment of any other money than that sixty-nine pounds, and when? - I cannot positively tell.</p>

What goods can you undertake to prove from your own knowledge came to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150153"/>the hands of Mr. Pitt from Hudson and Lowry? - I cannot prove but a very little quantity of my own delivery, because I am not in the habit of delivering goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Well begin with what you can first of all prove and then we will come to the rest? - There is no more than fifteen shillings and nine-pence, that I can speak to the delivery of them myself? there is a man of the name of Hatton who is constantly in the habit of carrying out goods.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time deliver any goods to be conveyed to Mr. Pitt? - I cannot say; I should imagine I have, but I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any delivered to him for that purpose? - I am in the habit of doing it every night, but I cannot positively say.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the sixty-nine pounds was the only sum that was due, had you any conversation about what was not due? - I had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you state to him the amount? - I did, one hundred and forty pounds one shilling and four-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say about that? - He said according to the agreement it was to be put in after Midsummer, which is an additional credit, and that it was to be paid three months after the usual time, the 24th of June, and consequently would not be due till the 24th of September; he said that it was not to be settled that time but in the next account.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. Was you privy to the agreement, or do you know it only from your master? - I do not know.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. What did he say on that occasion? - He said according to agreement Mr. Hudson was to put these goods in after Midsummer, and then they would be due at Michaelmas. We go from Midsummer to Michaelmas.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. He contended that by the agreement, he was to have three months extraordinary beyond the usual credit? - The account of these goods, according to custom, were to have been settled on the 24th of June, and he said according to the agreement, it was to be on the 24th of September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. At any rate they would not be payable for till after September.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. Do you know what was the consideration of this note of Clayburn's of your own knowledge? - No, I only know by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of Pitt yourself? - No, I had no transaction on this note.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Court. My lord I should think that this cannot be included within the statute.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. A debt not due is not only proveable under a commission, but it may be proved.</p>
               <p>Court. The statute of Charles the first and second will not extend to that.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell. At present we have proved more than a hundred pounds due upon notes, one of which he is the indorser of sixty-nine pounds four shilings, and forty-five pounds, they constitute a debt previous to the commission for they were both due at that time; and the witness states that he gave notice to Mr. Pitt, that Clayburn's note was not paid.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow to Beck. This note of Clayburn's was put in in order to else out a sum to convict a man of a capital offence. On your oath don't you know that every farthing of this money is paid? - On my oath I know nothing at all about it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe, on your oath, that there is one guinea, or one shilling due on the note? - I never heard that it has been paid.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you believe? - I don't know.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150154"/>Q. You don't know that Clayburn was arrested and paid it? - On my oath I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you know that on an arrest Clayburn paid every shilling of it? - I never knew that on my oath.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever hear it? - I never heard it. (The bill read by the clerk of the court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. They must go a great deal further than this.</p>
               <p>Russell to Beck. Do you know of any application to Mr. Clayburn for the payment of this note at the time it became due? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. When did it become due? - The 27th of August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow. What day is the act of bankruptcy proved? - On the 23d of August.</p>
               <p>Mr. Garrow here objected that this bill of Clayburn's, was not within the meaning of the statute of bankruptey as they had not proved a default in the case of Clayburn, which the court allowed.</p>

It was close by the watch house door; I asked the man if he had heard any fowls? he said he had heard a terrible noise with them about ten o'clock; then I went to the patrole of the night, and I asked him; the watchman took the man about half after ten.</p>

               <p>I am the watchman; going my round about ten in the evening, it was the fifth of January, going up into Duke's Court, at the Marquis of Granby's, in the Hambury, Westminster, I saw the prisoner come without his hat down the court.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was that from Mr. Needham's? A considerable distance? - A considerable distance, upwards of a quarter of a mile. Going up to call the hour, I see something lay in a corner between the houses of number 1, and number 2, in Duke's Court; I went and put my stick to it and stirred it, the prisoner-followed me up and said to me, what is that watchman? I said I think it is a soldier's knapsack, I put my hand to pull at my rattle to take it and spring it with my right hand and I took hold of him with my left, and told him he was my prisoner, and I sprung the rattle for further assistance, and the prisoner made but small. resistance, but I secured him till two patroles came to my assistance; I found nothing there on him, because the fowls were laying in the corner and he followed me up.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the fowls in? - In nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see him with the fowls in his hand? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him put the fowls in the corner? - No, him following me up gave me a suspicion.</p>

            Then who put them there, you don't know; and your only ground of suspicion of the prisoner was, he happened to be near where the fowls were? - Yes. I secured him, and put him in the watch-house, taking him to the watch-house they found some blood on his clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the fowls dead? - They were.</p>
               <p>Q. How had they been killed? - Their necks seemed to have been pulled off.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any blood about him? - Yes, we made search of him to find if he had any thing in his pockets, which the constable that is here, found a padlock with some keys. I did not search him, the constable did that took the padlock in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the padlock taken out of his pocket or from him? - Yes, from his pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the padlock and keys? - I did not take them into my custody, the constable did.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. He said I made but small resistance, I would be glad to know what resistance I made? - Yes, he made resistance, and shoved me off to disentangle himself from me, and asked me the reason for what I took him.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to ask him if I chose to make my escape whether I could or could not? - Yes, I was past the place having no suspicion of any thing laying there; but I thought I might see some girls of the town there, for which reason the prisoner followed me back, or otherwise I could not have took him.</p>
               <p>Q. I wish to know whether he has mentioned that he did not think me guilty of the crime or not? - I said that possible the man may be innocent, for what I know.</p>

               <p>Needham. I did not say so, I asked him if he had seen his acquaintance? and he mentioned about his having children, and I said I did not want to hurt the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Were these articles all together, or separate? - The linen was in a coloured apron on the chest, which was broke open, my husband's coat was folded up, and laid on the top of them.</p>
               <p>Q. The coat he has on now where was that? - In the chest.</p>
               <p>Q. When had you last seen these things? - At twelve o'clock in the day.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the room at twelve o'clock in the day did you shut it or lock it? - I locked it, and put the key in my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was there any appearance of violence at your door? - None at all, it locked and unlocked as easy as before.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any servants in your house? - I have not; the key was never out of my pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you happen to see any thing of the prisoner Freeman? - He was passing by through the passage, and the other gentleman took hold of him; I was in the shop, just outside of the shop door.</p>
               <p>Q. They were both detained I suppose? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they searched? - They were not in my presence, they were searched in our house, but I was not there at all at the time, there was a knife found on Graham, but not any property that I lost.</p>

            Then you have never recovered any property, except the coat, which your husband has on his back? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Mrs. Farnham, we are told you have a number of lodgers in the house, who know the situation of that room, and the lock, and all that? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You had seen this room at twelve o'clock, and not from that time till five; therefore if any person had been inclined to do any thing, they had from twelve o'clock till five to do it in? - I have no person of bad character in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Your lodgers doubtless have a number of people who come after them, that you don't know.</p>
               <p>Court. These things have not been found; do you know for a certainty that all the articles were in the room at twelve o'clock? - I am certain.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way then would you settle the value on them? - Seven or eight pounds is as little as I can put them at.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think they are worth five pounds,? - I am sure they would sell for more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said by Freeman when he was taken? - Not that I heard.</p>

               <p>I am an attorney; Mr. Hodges, the coal-merchant and I, were passing down Princes-street that evening, about five o'clock on Christmas Eve, hearing the cry of thieves and murder, just as we came to the door of Mr. Farnham's house we stopped, we saw Mr. Farnham struggling with the prisoner, Graham, just<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150162"/>between the shop door and the street door, in the passage.</p>

            How is this shop fituated? - There is a shop in the front, and a private passage, and the shop door is about a yard from the street door in the passage.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this struggle that you saw? - Just within side of the passage, Mr. Hodges caught hold of Graham in his hand and I together shoved him into the shop; at that instant the prisoner Freeman came along the passage and he endeavoured to pass me, I secured him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he passing? - He endeavoured to sculk by me without being observed, I stopped him and turned him also in, and before I got into the shop, I see Graham searching about him, and I heard something drop from Graham, I directed somebody to look for it, and they found something of a crow, we carried them then into the back parlour of the shop, and there Freeman dropped a large nail which somebody took up, I don't remember who, and the constable was sent for, and they were searched in the parlour, but no property was found on either of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Knowlys. Was Freeman got to the door when you laid hold of him? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had no possible opportunity of getting rid of any stolen property to any body in the street? - He certainly could not.</p>

            Freeman was not rushing by you, but going as you think, rather secretly out of the house? - He was going rather secretly, I don't think it would have been policy for him to have done it in any other way. This knife was taken out of Graham's pocket.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see any body there besides Graham? - Not at that instant, I laid hold of Graham and I had scarcely got hold of Graham before Mr. Manning said, here is another of them; I turned round and Mr. Manning had hold of the other prisoner, Freeman. They were taken into the parlour, and the officer was sent for and they were searched.</p>

               <p>Prisoner Grabam. I am a plaisterer by trade, about a fortnight before Christmas I was discharged. Christmas time of the year the trade is slack, and so I went down in the country to my wife's friends to stay there till after Christmas, I came up at Christmas Eve to look after work, going along I bursted my shoe, and having no money in my pocket to pay for its mending I recollected I knew a person in Wych-street that mended shoes, and I was there told to go to a grinder's shop in Princes-street; I went up to enquire after this man at this house, directly as I got up to the top of the stairs the gentleman of the house came up and seized me.</p>

               <p>I am a shepherd to Hawkes, the Prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you on the 2d of January number your sheep? - I did, and found the number all right. On Friday morning I visited them as usual, and I missed one, I came down and acquainted our man of it, he was coming to town and he told our master.</p>
               <p>Q. About what time on Friday morning did you miss it? - About eight o'clock. I found the place afterwards where it was killed, about one hundred yards off as near as I can guess. I found the skin in an adjoining field.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other part of the carcase attached to the skin then? - Yes, there is a deal left on, a good deal about the hinder part towards the tail.</p>
               <p>Q. How much of it? - There were pieces in several places, master can deseribe it better than I can, I have no doubt of it being the weather sheep I lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any part of a carcase which you presumed to be part of the carcase of the sheep? - Yes, I see part fitted on at the justice's, and it all fitted.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt of that part of the carcase which you saw at the justice's being part of the sheep which your master lost? - It all fitted exactly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any thing particular in the size of this sheep? - It was a very large sat sheep.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean to say by its sitting? did you find that these parts that were behind in the skin were missing in the carcase? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us what parts were left behind in the skin that were wanting in the carcase? - Master can tell better than I can. When they were all compared, the joints sitted as near as could be.</p>

I pursued him till I came to Clerkenwell Green, when I came to Clerkenwell Green, he went a cross the Green, and I got up to him and asked him what he had got? he said he had some suet coming to a tallow chandler in Cow Cross. He had a bag.</p>
               <p>Q. What past then? - He then went on crossing the Green, I had not been satisfied with him, I felt the bag and I felt what was in the bag, and I knew it was not suet; then in crossing the Green he crossed from me, I told him I would shew him the right way to Cow Cross, if he was going to Cow Cross. He was still going to cross, I told him he should not cross there, I would bring him to the watch-house; when I told him that, he throws down the bag, and then I pursues him, and catches him, and brings him into the watch-house, and examined what he had. I went for the superintendant Richard Rolse, and he came, and he examined what was in the bag, we examined the bag together, and he had got the two hind quarters, and the two shoulders, and the sat of the sheep.</p>

Was the prisoner delivered into your custody on Thursday night, the 2d of January? - When I was sent for on Thursday night, the 2d of January, I was eating my supper, when I saw him I said to him, what are you here again? knowing him to be in custody for some beasts before; says he, it is only dogs meat. it is carrion; says he, coming along Highgate, I saw a man killing a sheep in a ditch, and I asked him for the fat and these pieces, and he gave them to me, he was somebody's servant near there; says I, it is very odd to me that this man should give his malter's property away, I then searched the sack on the bench of the watch-house; the first time I put my hand in I pulled out a shoulder; says I, North, do you call this dogs meat? I call it very good meat. I then put my hand into the sack again, and pulled out the hind quarter, two legs and two lions, very heavy, very fat and good mutton, quite warm; at that time I put my hand into the sack again, and pulled out another shoulder cut more fuller from the head to the breast; then I found fat, about two stone, there a bouts, pulled out in a rough manner. I then went and searched the prisoner, I found a heart rather warm in his waistcoat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the whole appear to be lately killed? - Yes, for it was still warm. I searching his right hand waistcoat pocket, I found this knife with the blood and tallow on it, as it is now. I have taken care of it from that time to this.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the blade wet? - It was. In his left hand breeches pocket I found there three keys, one of them is a padlock key, they have been in my possession ever since.</p>
               <p>Court. You had seen this man before? did he live in your neighbourhood? - He told me he lived in Chick-lane.</p>

               <p>Q. Could you perceive by the skin that they were not jointed properly? - I could, by what was left on the skin.</p>

            From the whole of these singular circumstances, had you the least doubt, or have you still, of the part that you saw at the justice's being your property? - I am clearly certain they were the part of that sheep, not only that, but the fore part he cut all the fat off, and left it on the skin; I have had the skin delivered back again from the police office, and it has been in my possession ever since; it was given me by Murphy.</p>

             near Highgate, whom I was acquainted with as a sheep drover, and knew him to be esteemed a very honest man, he was bringing some sheep to town and one of them dropped down dead with a disorder called the rutter; he stopped to skin it, and I waited with him, and offered him five shillings for the fat and some of the flesh, which I intended to boil for the dogs that always go with the waggon, which he agreed to, and with my pocket knife I cut off the legs and shoulders, which was fit for nothing else but dogs meat, and put it into the sack I had, and left the rest of the carcase there, and he took the skin with him; I came towards Clerkenwell, where I was taken into custody on a suspicion that it might be fat belonging to a person that produced a sheep skin; and Bushel being at this time gone to bring some sheep from Lincolnshire, I cannot have him to prove the circumstance above mentioned; however I humbly beg leave to submit it to your lordship whether it is probable if the sheep was stolen, I should leave the rest of the sheep behind, much less the skin which is valuable. I wish further to know how the prosecutor can say that it belongs to a sheep of his; to your lordship I appeal<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150166"/>and I humbly beg your interposition for an injured, innocent man.</p>

            What did you consent to? - He asked me to let him leave the cask till the morning; I consented to his leaving the cask, saying that he might come in the morning and carry it away; after the man was gone I had some suspicion that the man had not come honestly by the cask, I went and examined the cask and saw How on the cask; I went down to Mr. How's house, and informed Mr. How's servant, I told Mr. Meadows, and Meadows came the next morning, and when he came<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150167"/>I shewed him the same cask that the prisoner delivered the over night.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went to Mr. Low's door and asked the young woman if they wanted any beer? she said there is an empty cask in the cellar you may take it away; so with that I took the cask away and carried it to this public house and asked Mr. Wheatley to let me leave the cask there till the morning? he said yes, I told him I would call for it as the morning following, in the morning when I came there there was the officers to stop me from taking it away; when I went to Mr. Low's I never asked for the cask.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any body to prove that they were about the house at the time? - I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. What time on the 13th of December did you go home? - I suppose about three in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>I am a bearer, and grave-digger of the parish of St. Giles's, in the Fields. On Thursday, the 13th of December, I saw the four prisoners at the bar about two o'clock; Parsley, Williams, Barber and Brown, I saw them in Lloyd's-court, leading to Denmark-street, I saw at first in company together, Parsley and Williams separate from Barber and Brown, Parsly or Williams, which, I cannot swear to, having a bundle in possession, Parsley and Williams went into the shop of Mr. Bulrance's, I saw as they were going along, a green silk petticoat hanging out of a bundle, I had a suspicion that they were stolen from the fire, there had been a fire that morning; I went to the adjoining public house, and communicated my suspicion; the landlord did not seem very anxious towards helping me to take him.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give me the name of that landlord? - His name is Goby, he keeps the Eight Bells, he was not exceeding well; as I was coming out I met Croker in possession of Barber and Brown on suspicion; I says to Craker I am as glad I have seen you, as if any body had given me five guineas, there are two gone in the shop over the way with a swag, Croker and I immediately went into the shop, and when we went into the shop, we found the prisoners, Parsley and Williams standing on one side of the counter, the things were on the opposite side of the counter, on a little shelf, on the left-hand, the things that were brought in, Croker enquired for the things that these men brought in, and Bulrance said here is the things, I will not lie about it, and delivered them up; says I, if these be the things there is a green silk petticoat among them, and a green silk petticoat was produced on the counter among the articles; we took the prisoners into custody, and brought them to Bow-street, and they were cemmitted for trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you enquire of them at all how they came by the things? - I never enquired about them, Mr. Croker said he knew them to be thieves.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. I am for Parsley; where do you live? - No. s, Denmark-street.</p>
               <p>Q. This green petticoat was the thing that particularly caught your attention? - Yes, and the look of the men together; I knew one of them to be a thief, I knew two of them before.</p>
               <p>Q. This green petticoat had particularly caught your attention? - I saw it taken out of the bundle, it caught my attention from the other things.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course at Bow-street you mentioned the circumstance of the silk petticoat? - I did, as I have done now.</p>
               <p>Q. You gave your information at Bow-street, it was read over to you, and you signed it? - It was so.</p>

               <p>Q. This word swag, where did you pick it up? - When I was a patrole, in the parish of St. Giles's in the Fields.</p>
               <p>Q. That means then a bundle of linen does it? - I have heard thieves say so.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. That man he said he saw five or six swags go into that man's house, a little while before he saw us go in? - I said I had seen two or three people go in before into Bulrance's, he keeps a kind of an old clothes shop.</p>

            Look at them? - I really cannot swear to the identity of their persons, that I could not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you think you never saw the prisoners before? - I would neither say one thing or the other, as I cannot swear to the identity.</p>
               <p>Q. Is Kane the last witness in court? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at that man, do you know him? - Yes, he has been about five or six weeks in the neighbourhood, he has taken an old house in the neighbourhood.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him in your house? - No, yes, I recollect seeing him on the day there was a parcel of clothes brought in, a lot of wearing apparel; he came in along with another person of the police, at the time there was a mob in too.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you do remember some one day that Kane came into your shop? - Yes, and another of the police.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body in your shop when Kane came in? - I was looking over a little bundle of things.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray what might be in that bundle? - There was a petticoat, a gown, but I cannot recollect all the things now, I was put in too much agitation, I must own.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a gown? - I really could not be positive, but if I was to see the things I believe I should know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a muslin gown? - I believe it was.</p>

            Was there a bed-gown? - I cannot be positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect any thing like a pair of stays? - Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a stuff gown? - That I cannot charge my memory with, there was a silk handkerchief, that I can well remember, because I looked at it.</p>
               <p>Q. Who might bring these things into your shop? - I will tell you the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150170"/>circumstance; I was in the back room, and I saw through the window, between that and the shop, the shadow of a person, and a knock on the counter, saying do you buy clothes; there was one person only, I came out, and the bundle was on the counter, and I went naturally to look at the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. The bundle did not come there of itself? how came the bundle there; must not you look at the person that brought the bundle? - I did not pay any great attention to the person.</p>
               <p>Q. How many were there? - There were one person at that moment, but another came in at the moment, at the same time, and asked for a pair of boots, while I was untying the bundle, of course I threw a pair on the counter, for him to look at, which I had just purchased; while I was looking over the bundle there came in a person to ask for one thing or another; nevertheless as I could do but one thing at a time, I was looking over the bundle, to ascertain the value, as I had just done that, there came in I fancy two police officers, for there were a number of people came in all at once, and took the man that had the boots, I can remember that, because there were a pair of boots in his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they take any body else? - I believe they might, but then there was such a mob in the place.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of the man that brought the bundle, did they happen to take him? - I am almost at a loss there, because I cannot swear to the identity of the person.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the man that brought the bundle, because he came first? - The plainest recollection that I can have of the man, is that he was in a scarlet waistcoat; I am sure if I was on oath I could not swear to his person.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean to say that on your oath you don't know they took the man that had the bundle? - Not theidentical man.</p>
               <p>Q. I put a plain and simple question, and I will have a plain and simple answer; do you mean to swear that you don't know that they took the man that brought the bundle? - I could swear that I don't know the identity of the person.</p>
               <p>Q. I ask you whether you don't know that they took the man that brought the bundle? I will have an answer, or I will commit you to Newgate. - I should imagine they must indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you don't know that they took the man that had the bundle, let the man be who he will? - If I did but comprehend rightly how that is.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you say that you don't know that they took the man that brought the bundle? - I would not swear that they did not take the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear that you don't know that they did take him? I will have an answer. - I wish to give you an answer; I could swear that I don't know that they took the man, I only want to comprehend.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that you don't know that they took the man that brought the bundle? I can swear this, that I am not sure that they took the man that brought the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are not sure they took the man that brought the bundle? Do you believe they took the man that brought the bundle? - I might there to be sure, say, that they might take the man that brought the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe they took the man that brought the bundle? - Yes, I do believe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why do you believe it? - I cannot come home positively to that.</p>
               <p>Q. But why do you believe it? - Because they took some men away, therefore I should suppose, but if I knew.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you not sure that they took the man that brought the bundle? - I be<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150171"/>lieve they took the man that brought the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a doubt about it? - Shall I mention one circumstance more.</p>
               <p>Q. No, I ask you if you have a doubt about it? - I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you a doubt about it? - I will give you an answer to the best of my knowledge.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you a doubt about it, say yes, or no? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now sir, what did you mean by saying just now that you was not sure, and now you tell me that you have not a doubt about it? did you ever see the man that brought the bundle, or the man that came in after him before? - I would with you to put that question again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the man that brought the bundle before? - Certainly not, or else I should have recollected him, I think I should be sure of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now sir, you say a man came in and asked about the boots? had you ever seen him before? - No, I recollect to the best of my memory, you may depend on that.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that you never saw the man that enquired about the boots? - No, I never saw him before.</p>
               <p>Q. Then of course you must have looked at him; now look at them, and tell me whether either of them are the men? There is not a man there that I can swear to the identity of his person.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't believe, on your oath, that either of these men were in your shop on that day? - I am sure I could not know them again.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you don't believe that either of these men were in your shop on that day? - I more believe on their being taken; I cannot recollect them at all in the shop.</p>

            Then you do not know that you saw them in your shop that day? - I cannot recollect in the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Try if you cannot recollect which of them were taken away with the bundle? - I am at a loss every way, for I do not recollect the identity of one person whatever. While I was looking over the bundle, naturally asking one thing or another about them, my attention was more to the things I was looking over, than to the persons which were in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this all that passed? Do you make a rule of not observing people that come to your house? - Yes, I observe them when I deal, when I ask the price, we wish first to know the price they ask; frequently when I have looked at bundles that come, I have not misded the people who brought them till I have looked at the bundles, and then I ask the price, and then I naturally look at them.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, sir, why do you say that was all the passed? In what respect, my lord.</p>
               <p>Q. You know it is not all that passed, therefore tell me what passed? I am sure I cannot in the least recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see a man of the name of Croker? Did not he say any thing? I remember Croker being there, because I have seen him over and over.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Croker say? Croker asked me what bundle had been brought in? I had them on the counter examining; I said here is the bundle that was brought in to be disposed of.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that all you said? I said, I will tell no lie about them, I have no meaning of prevarication as I know of, I assure you; I have not the least doubt but the officers will give me a bad character; but wherein is the ground of it?</p>
               <p>Court. You have done enough to impeach your character.</p>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150172"/>Q. Will you tell us that you know respecting the prisoners at the bar, to have happened on the 13th of December last? - On the 13th of December last I was going towards Tottenham-court-road, me and Mr. Hatch, a constable, belonging to Pancras, near St. Giles's church; I saw Barber and Brown, the two lads, standing near the church, near Denmark-street? I says to the officer that was with me, there is a couple of young prigs, I immediately went with him towards them and desired that he would not let them run away, as I meant to search them; I accordingly came up to them, and they had some money in their hands, some silver; I enquired of them whether they were sharing the money or not, with that we took them into custody, Hatch one and me she other, and steared towards a public house; I walked about three or four or five yards, immediately comes Kane up, one of the evidences that you have heard before; and he says to me, Mr. Croker, I am very glad to see you; says he there are four of them, and two have gone into that house; with that I left the prisoners, Barber and Brown, in charge of Hatch, while I went to the shop where Kane had told me; the others had gone with a swag to Bulrance's shop, where I understood the other two were; I went to the shop, I immediately saw Williams and Parsley in the shop; I immediately demanded the bundle of the man of the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body belonging to the house? I saw Bulrance the man belonging to the shop behind the counter.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he doing? He was the opposite side of the counter, but nothing was on the counter, he was at the window, I took and handkerchief immediately out of my pocket to secure them, and at the same time I demanded the bundle that they had brought in, the bundle was untied.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did it lay? - It laid on the opposite side of the counter on a window I believe, some where on the window, it was not on the counter till he gave it to me; the prisoner Williams told me that they had no bundle; and Parsley told me that he was buying the boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray at this time when you first went in, was there any body in the shop besides these two men? - I think there was a woman in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. There were no men, no strangers in the shop? - Only what came in with me, there was nobody in the shop but customers, except the two prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the least time that you knew of there being in before you went in? - It could not be three minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now was Bulrance near the prisoners? - It did not appear to me they were talking to him; he said at last I must tell the truth, and he handed them over to me on the counter loose saying, here they are.</p>
               <p>Bulrance. You saw me looking at the very things.</p>
               <p>Croker. I then searched them and took possession of the other two, and took them all over to Mr. Bond.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might you be in the shop before you took them away? - I believe I might be there for three, or four, or five minutes; I searched them in the shop, I tied their hands in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you searched there, did Mr. Bulrance go away or did he stay while you searched him? - He staid in the shop all the time, and I left him there.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had Bulrance an opportunity of seeing the prisoners faces that were in the shop? - As well as I have of your's.</p>
               <p>Q. Because I understand from him that he hardly saw them? - I took him before Mr. Bond soon after, and he want<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150173"/>ed to persuade Mr.

             the same; Bulrance was with us at six o'clock when he saw the prisoners again, he hesitated a great deal, Mr. Bond had a vast deal of trouble with him; likewise the grand Jury had a great deal of trouble with him.</p>
               <p>Q. You have no doubt, I understand from you, that he saw him most clearly all the time, and you was in the shop four, five or six minutes? - I am sure that he must have seen him as well as me, and must have known him, I was there long enough for him to have taken more notice a great deal, when I detected him in such a matter as that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Bulrance and these people appear to be strangers? - I cannot say whether they were talking together or not, the young men were on the opposite side, I came in in a great hurry, and the old man stood looking at me, I believe he was terrified.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. When you came in Parsley told you that he was buying a pair of boots? - He did.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you found him looking at a pair of boots? - I did, I charged him with the bundle and he said I am buying a pair of boots, and he had the boots in his hand; Williams said, when I taxed him with the bundle, we have no bundle; I spoke to Williams as knowing of him the best, and Williams said there was no bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. You then addressed yourself to Parsley and they both denied the bundle, and then Bulrance said I must tell the truth, here is the bundle; on your oath, do you mean to say, that when you first went in, Parsley said any thing about the bundle? - I taxed him with it, and particularly mentioned the green petticoat.</p>
               <p>Q. The first account you gave was this, you asked Williams where the bundle was, and he said there was no bundle? - I spoke in general to the prisoners and the man. They both denied it, and Parsley said that he was buying a pair of boots.</p>
               <p>Q. Which you found to be true so far as appearances went? - Just so.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. Did you find any thing on me? did you see me searched? - Yes, but I cannot tell immediately what Hatch found on him.</p>

Croker and I took the other two to the public house near the church, and he left them with me while he went over to this Bulrance's, while he went in and took the other two into custody. I searched them all and found nothing material on any of them.</p>
               <p>Q. You had no conversation with Brown or Barber about it? - None at all. I have got an handkerchief that I found in Bulrance's house belonging to Mrs. Smith.</p>
               <p>Bulrance. I know this handkerchief to my opinion, and I will tell you how, when all the people were gone, a woman comes in at the door and says, there is an handkerchief down from the counter on the ground, I goes to look and took it up, and Mr. Hatch came back from the office, and said, there is an handkerchief wanting, then says I, there is an handkerchief that the woman picked up.</p>
               <p>Q. Who brought that handkerchief? - I don't know, I never saw it till I saw it on the ground.</p>

            How far is that from St. Giles's where the Church is, to Denmark-street? - I really cannot tell you, I am a stranger to that part. These are my stays, I know them by this tucker being on them. I know also the bed gown and black Cloak.</p>

How could any body get into the parlour from the street? - The street door is all the day open, and there is a hatch, and from that hatch the parlour door may be seen; the parlour door is a little distance from the hatch; I went down stairs, and when I came up I missed my things, I was not down above five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. Could any body see you go out of the parlour in the street? - Yes, they might if they were looking through the hatch.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it that you found out it was done by the prisoners? - We did not know any thing of it till the next Saturday night, this happened on Friday, on the next day, Saturday afternoon I was took dangerously ill, and kept my bed some time.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that morning did you happen to see any of the prisoners at the bar about your house? - I cannot say that I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see them before? - No, I cannot recollect.</p>
               <p>Court to Croker. How far is this lady's house from where you saw the prisoners? - About a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Parsley. I leave it to my counsel.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Williams. I was coming down Denmark-street, and I saw a clothes shop, Bulrance's shop, I went into it, and asked him for a pair of boots, and he said he believed that he had a pair that would suit me; as soon as I got in, about a couple of minutes, these people came in, and Mr. Croker laid hold of me, and they asked me if I had brought any things in? I said I never brought any in; as to the things that Mr. Croker brought to my charge, I never saw any thing of them before in my life.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Brown. The morning that this happened I got up, and I went down to see my mother, she lives with my uncle; I went down to work, and my mother was taken very bad; I went to my sister in Shoreditch, and told her of it; and coming back from my sister's I met this

I had a job to do at Mr. Willett's, in Smithfield, and I had been home to dinner at my father's, he lives in the parish of St. Ann's; he has lived there for this five years. I was coming from dinner to return to work again, and I met Barber, and had hardly spoke to him two words, before Mr. Croker and Hatch took us to a public house to search us, and they brought over two others, and laid a charge of a robbery to us that I am innocent of. I don't know whether my friends are present now, I know they have been present all day.</p>

               <p>I am a butcher, I live with William Lindus. About a quarter after six Saturday morning, I went into the shop to reach down a rump and surloin of beef, and when I came out I instantly missed a buttock of beef.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is your shop? - In Whitechapel, High-street, as soon as I came out again I missed the buttock and avtch bone of beef off from the stall, and I ran after the prisoner and see her drop it herself, she was walking away as soon as she dropped it, and I went up to her and secured her and brought her up to the shop, and picked up the meat, I could swear to it by the appearance, to be my master's property. I have no doubt about it at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the woman say any thing? - She said nothing at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think you should have known that piece of beef if you had seen it ten miles off? - Yes, I should have known it any where.</p>
               <p>Q. To Lindus. When you came home what did you know about it? - I was not come down stairs, I heard a noise while I was dressing; when I came down the man had got the woman, and I sent for an officer, and she was taken to the office in Lambeth-street, the beef was produced there; the man said that he went in doors, and came out, and saw this beef was gone, and he went down the alley to her to the slaughter house door, and there he saw the woman standing, and he went and took her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that was your beef that the woman took? - Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she say any thing to it? - She said she did not take it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150177"/>Prisoner. I was coming along between six and seven in the morning, my business is, that I deal at Billingsgate, I saw a little man coming along, I saw him take the piece of beef off the stall, and he ran down the alley, and he throwed it down, and as I was coming along the young fellow that was there he said it was me, the man seeing of that, he took to his heels and ran away; the young fellow took me and called his master down, and his master came down with his stockings about his heels, and his clothes all lose.</p>
               <p>Court to Slade. Did you see a man running? - There was a man in the alley, coming up with a pipe in his mouth, he was walking along with another man, there were two of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner I never meddled with the beef; I have not any witnesses in London; my husband is in India.</p>

On the 13th of December last I lost an anchor and chain, from a large working barge, that was moored off Chelsea Church; I had seen it the day before, on the 12th, I never saw it again till I saw it at the police office, at Shadwell, which was Wednesday the 21st.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Mr. Score, you say you have several barges, I take it for granted these barges get a drift sometimes? - To my misfortune they do, I have lost three anchors and chains before.</p>

            Perhaps this barge got a drift? - It did not; the tide was ebbing, and would have come up to it in about an hour if it had been fastened; my servant got up and fastened it by the working chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Anchors are pretty common by the side of the river, about Chelsea and Shadwell? - I suppose so, most that have crafts have anchors with them.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, Mr. Score, Cluer was taken before the magistrate, and had been discharged? - He was taken the 16th and discharged; I knew nothing of the business till the Saturday following. On the 16th the search warrant was taken out of the police office, and he was taken, and I believe he was then discharged.</p>

               <p>Q. How long before you attended the justice? - On Saturday week after I went to the justice. On Friday morning between one and two o'clock, I went to the anchor and chain and made it fast about the post at the Church corner at Chelsea, and I locked the other end into the barge, on the beetson of the barge; after that I put the key into my pocket, I went home to bed, I thought the barge would be fast, and between five and six one of our servants came and told me to get up and make the barge fast, or else it would be asloat, and that the anchor and chain was gone; they told me the barge would be a drift if I did not make it fast again;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150178"/>I got up and found the anchor and chain gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the barge have got a drift from between one and two in the morning, to between five and six? - No, she was a ground; if I had stayed longer the flood would have come up and carried her off, and she would have been lost as the other barges were.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you find this anchor and chain again? - We found it on Saturday when I attended at the justice's office, at Shadwell.</p>
               <p>Q. You say this barge could not have been deprived of the anchor and chain by accident; it must be taken by somebody? - It must.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is this anchor and chain now? - It is here.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Finch at all? - Yes, he lives in Chelsea.</p>
               <p>Q. How far from the place where this barge was moored? - Very nigh a mile; he is a fisherman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the magistrate when he was there? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear him say any thing about this anchor and chain, and how he came by it? - I never heard him say any thing till he came to the justice's, he then said that he picked it up.</p>

               <p>I keep the Crown public house in St. Ann's, Limehouse.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the prisoner Finch? - I know him by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of this business about the anchor and chain? - On the 16th of December last, on Monday, Finch came into my house, between seven and eight in the morning, and asked me if I would give him credit for a penny worth of purl? he said he had been a fishing at Limehouse, and found an anchor and chain, he had caught a chain in Limehouse hole, in hauling up part of his net he hauled up one part of the chain and that he had left his partner with the net to see if he could clear it; and could I tell him where he could sell it? I told him I could not tell him where he could sell it; and that past on, and in some little time afterwards he went out of my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the anchor and chain at that time? - No. I went out of the back yard and followed him, and I looked over my wall, and saw the anchor in his boat; my house joins to the river.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you trust him with any liquor? - Not at that time, only his pennyworth of purl. He asked me then what had become of all the rope shops that were about this place?</p>
               <p>Q. Was he able to see you in the back lane? - He was. I told him there was a rope shop next door, that was Thomas Cluer's, the prisoner at the bar; with that he took the anchor and stock and carried it up into Mr. Cluer's warehouse that joins to the house, it is at the back part, covered in, and then went down and brought the chain up out of the boat.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the chain? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the chain a light one, or how? - I was not nigh enough to know the weight of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing happen to Finch as he was going in to the premises? - He got up four or five steps and fell down with the chain into the mud.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Cluer at all at that time? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left your yard and went into the house, was Finch returned to his boat, or was he in Cluer's premises? - He was in Cluer's premises; I lost sight of him there.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you see him again? - I saw no more of him till he came in and asked for change for a guinea; this might be in about five or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150179"/>Q. Did you give him change then? - My father did afterwards. He said he was to have fourteen shillings out of the guinea, as the price of the anchor and chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he went with the change? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Court. He only paid a penny in your house? - He only asked for the credit of a pennyworth of purl, and after he came in with the guinea he had a pot of brandy hot. I don't know exactly how much he spent in the house, my father took the money; he came back and said that he had had a dispute about the seven shillings, and had got another shilling; he said there had been a mistake in the weight, and Cluer gave him another shilling.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You said you did not know Finch before? - I had seen him before.</p>
               <p>Q. He came to you between seven and eight in the morning, was it day light then? - It was.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a morning was it? - It was a darkish morning, and wet.</p>
               <p>Q. People were up? - Yes, I was up.</p>
               <p>Q. He said he had been a fishing, and his net caught hold of an anchor and chain in the river? - He said it had caught hold.</p>
               <p>Q. And he afterwards brought up an anchor and chain to you? - Not to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he not got it when he asked you where he could get rid of it? - No, it was in the boat.</p>
               <p>Court. It was in the boat when he said that his partner was getting it out of the net? - It was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You told him that your next door neighbour would buy it? - I did not; I told him there was a rope shop next door.</p>
               <p>Q. You never saw Cluer at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen many anchors and chains before? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. You only saw it from your wall in the boat? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know is, that was an anchor and chain? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you attended before the magistrate? - I did.</p>

Mr. Cluer said to me, you cannot blame me for striving to get away, for I knew what you was came upon, I knew you was come about the anchor and chain. Then I apprehended him, and brought him to the office; and the next day, in company with an officer of Chelsea, I went and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150181"/>apprehended Finch, the other prisoner.

               <p>Q. Whereabouts is the value of the chain altogether? - Between three and four pounds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. You say you know this anchor by the two rivetts? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you been used to anchors much? - I have.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never see an anchor in your life rivetted? - Only this one.</p>
               <p>Q. That is all the mark by which you know it? - There are two twists in the anchor besides.</p>
               <p>Court to Arnold. You say that he carried the anchor to Cluer's washhouse; did you see him do that? - I did not see him put it there, I see him go into the back gate with it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Finch. The 16th of last month I was going a fishing off from Limehouse Hole; going a fishing about a quarter of an hour, I catched a fastening under the water, at last it weighed with me, and I found it was this anchor; after I catched, this anchor, I rowed to the nearest public house to leave it, and the man directed me to this man's house; I said I had picked up an anchor and chain, and if any person owned it I should be very glad for the owner to have it; I said I did not want to sell it? I meant to leave it till the next morning, when I would advertize it, then at half past nine I went to the Trinity officers, and asked them if they had heard any body had lost an anchor? they said no; afterwards I went into a shop, a seed shop, nigh Mr. Cluer's, and I was talking about advertizing the anchor and chain; says he, you cannot advertize it, for you have sold it to Mr. Cluer for fifteen shillings; says I, I have not sold it, says he, you have, and I will do Mr. Cluer over, he shall not live in Limehouse, under my roof. We osten have occasion to weigh an anchor for government, we can weigh an anchor of a thousand pounds weight, with a net. I have served his Majesty till lately; I have served under Admiral Hood, in the American war.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Cluer. I leave my defence to my counsel; I never was brought under any charge in my life before.</p>

               <p>I am a peruke-maker; I have known the prisoner twelve or fourteen years; I was going past on my own business, on the 16th of December, and I saw his shop door open, and I saw Mr. Riley in Cluer's house; and I said what is the matter? says he to me, these gentlemen say, they have got a search warrant, for King's stores, meaning Riley, West, and Forrester, who were together; he then said that there was a man brought an anchor in the morning, by the recommendation of Mr. Arnold. He was taken up to the magistrate, and the magistrate acquitted him, I was present over the way while he went in to be examined, and he came back discharged; Mr. Cluer said to me will you be so good as to go along with me to Chelsea, and to find out the man that has left this anchor and chain; I knew Cluer was taken up on Saturday night, and I went there, and his wife said lork, I wish the man could be found out; I told her I would try to find him; on Monday morning I went up to the office, to procure a warrant if I should find him, and I found the man had been taken the Sunday night. I look on him to be as honest industrious man as ever was in the parish, he has lived in the parish, apprentice and master fourteen years or more.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at the bar the first of January? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you very sure as to his person? I have not the least doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - Just at this side of Stanmore, by Cannon Wall, as near as I can estimate the road, the midway of the road that comes from Edgeware. The first time I saw him might be about ten minutes before five o'clock; I was in a poll chase and four; I had been down into Hertfordshire in a coach and four to attend a funeral. I was on the right hand side of the coach. I saw the prisoner on horse back, and as he passed the window on the off side of the coach a gentleman that was with me immediately said there is an highwayman. No, says I, it cannot be an highwayman, his horse is too conspicuous a figure, being a pyed ball horse; we will rode and presently some little altercation took place between the postilion and him. I concluded that one of our leaders was rusty, and I concluded that the postilion by some means or other had run against the gentleman that was passing, therefore I got up and looked out at the carriage window, and I asked the prisoner, Sir, what is the matter, what do you want? my head was out of the window, and my shoulders as far as I could reach; he left the postilion and immediately came up and pulled out a pistol, and presented it right before me, gentlemen, says he, your money immediately, I am a distressed man, and if the carriage stirs another foot, I will fire into the carriage, by the Holy Ghost, with that there was one or two of the gentlemen got out of the carriage on the other side, and he seeing them quit the carriage, going towards the horses he immediately left me turned his horse's head, rode towards the coachman or postilion and fired his pistol, immediately I saw the slath and heard the Report. There was a gentleman that was in the carriage ran after him and hallooed stop thief, stop highwayman; but how far he ran I cannot pretend to say; in a short time afterwards he cames back and says, I have got his hat; when he came up to the carriage a crape was fastened to the fore part of the hat.</p>

            When did you next see him? - He was apprehended immediately and was taken; when I saw him personally to know him, it was at the White Hart, at Edgeware; I went on there, and they soon after brought in the prisoner at the bar, I goes up to him and said, sir, I am very sorry to see you in this situation, do you know me? he said I am an unfortunate man. I am in a distressed situation; I am a gentleman, and as such I hope you will treat me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. You say this was about five o'clock on the first of January? - It was between four and five.</p>

            Did you see any body then? - I did not. I heard the prisoner say, by the Holy Ghost if you stir another yard I will fire through the carriage; I then saw him, I had let down the glass, I saw a pistol in his hand, with that I had my head out of the carriage at the window, and Mr. Bacon pulled me back from the window, and I heard the prisoner say gentlemen, your money; I am a distressed man, your money or your lives; with that Mr. Bacon's head was out of the window and what past between the prisoner and Mr. Bacon I cannot say, but I heard the pistol fired and I saw the slash; I jumped out of the carriage then, and I followed the prisoner, crying stop thief! stop highwayman! I saw a hat fall off his head, the crape was pinned in the hat, I picked it up, and I turned back to the gentlemen, and said I have got his hat and crape, this will lead to some discovery or something of that fort. I saw him in about three quarters of an hour after, where we stopped at the White Hart at Edgeware; he said he was a gentleman, and he hoped we would use him as such; we told him certainly we would, and any thing that he wished for, he should have.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this that the carriage was stopped? - About a quarter before five, Mr. Bacon had but just looked at his watch, it was a very clear evening, it was a frost.</p>
               <p>Q. Lock at the prisoner and tell me whether you have any doubt of his being the man? - I have not the least in the world.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. I understand that on some occasion or other, you have said that you could not possibly swear to the prisoner? - I said from compassion I wished I could not swear to him.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that you said from the crap, the thickness of it, and it being over his face, and it being so dark, that you could not swear to his face? - I never said so.</p>
               <p>Court. Was the crape over his face? - Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. Did you pick up the hat? - I did.</p>

               <p>Q. He had a horse from the carriage, I presume, to pursue him? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray sir, will you give me leave to ask, what is the reason you now take on yourself to swear positively to the prisoner, though you wished formerly to avoid it? - I said, I did not wish to take any man's life away.</p>
               <p>Q. Why have you altered your opinion? - I have no motive in the world.</p>

As we were coming on this side of Stanmore, we were stopped by the prisoner at the bar, who demanded our money, he said he was a distressed man, by the Holy Ghost, and the money he must have directly, if not he would fire into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. How was that pistol placed, what position was it in? - He had it against the window, pointing at some distance from the window; this gentleman gets up, and asks him what he wanted? Mr. Bacon did; in the mean time we had a friend in the coach with us, and he got out, he said Toon I will not stay here to be shot, I will get out, he got out, and I followed him, as soon as we had got to the head of the coach, he turned his horse thort about, and he went on, and as he was going on he fired his pistol at the postilion, as I thought; we went after him, two of us, and took his hat and crape; he was rode after by the postilion, and apprehended and taken to Edgeware, I was not there. The prisoner is the very man, I am quite sure.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. I understand that the prisoner wore and a double crape at the time the man that stopped the know that. The hat a distance from the coach, about a hundred yards.</p>

               <p>Q. Was not the crape over his face at the time that he stopped the coach? - It was not.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand that the person did not attempt to fire till he was pursued by the postilion? - It was fired when he turned, before he was pursued, because there was nobody after him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not two gentlemen jump out of the coach? - They did.</p>
               <p>Q. You cannot take on yourself to swear in what direction that pistol was fired? - It appeared to me at the postilion.</p>

On the 2d of January I was returning from Barking in a coach and four, I drove the fore leaders; this gentleman on a pyed-ball horse, came up to assist me with the horses, because I could not make them go; I told him I wanted no assistance, I would make them go presently; he went on with his horse, and mine followed, and I past him, and this gentleman came along side again, and I told him I wished I had his horse, instead of mine; he rode up to me and presented a pistol, and said stop, and not to look back, and I stopped directly; then he went to the carriage, and came back again, and as he came back to pass me, he fired a pistol close over my shoulder, I said d-n you, though I have got such a gib, I will take you before you get to town; and I took a horse out of the carriage, and rode off immediately, and catched him about two miles before I got to Edgeware; I got past him, and said you are the person that I am after; he came up to me, and snapped a pistol at me, I got hold of his bridle, and he got from me again, I directly rode after him, and cried stop thief! riding through Edgeware I lost fight of him; there came a man by with a bundle of wood on his back, and I asked him if he had seen such a person, and he said he was about half a mile forward, I got up to him about the four mile stone, and I turned him, and he snapped a pistol, and it flashed in the pan; he went on again a little further, and snapped pistol at me again, but however I took him, and carried him to Edgeware; a butcher followed with me, and he jumped off his horse, and I jumped off mine, and we took hold of him; the butcher wrenched the pistol out of his hand. I have got some powder and ball that I took out of his pockets.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alby. Have you ever been concerned before in this business? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you never heard that there was a forty pounds reward for the apprehension of a highwayman? - I did not think of it at this time.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have run the hazard you did in endeavouring to apprehend him, if you did not think there was a reward for apprehending him? - Yes, I would indeed, and I would run the hazard again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the prisoner was never out of your sight? - Yes, he was out of my sight for the value of ten minutes, and I waited till a butcher came by on the road, and he told me which way to pursue.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray was the prisoner apprehended within four miles of town? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray then how came you to swear that you took him just coming into Edgeware? - That was when I got hold of him first.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the hat fall? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the crape over his face when he came up to the coach? - I saw no crape at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you see the hat drop? - I suppose it was him that dropped it.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take on yourself positively to swear that the prisoner was not out<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150188"/>of your sight more than four or five minutes? - I said he was out of my sight ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you attempted to stop the prisoner at the entrance of Edgware, had he his hat on his head then at that time? - He had.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you stop there to get somebody to assist you, or to change horses? - I changed horses no where.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did you stop in Edgeware? - I did not stop a moment no where, only when I got hold of his bridle.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did not you stop for the purpose of getting somebody to assist you? - No, I rode and called out stop thief.</p>

            Pray sir, where was it you met with this butcher? - At the seven mile stone.</p>
               <p>Q. How came this butcher to pursue? - Because he heard that I cried stop thief coming through the town, and he followed me with nothing but a halter on his horse, he and his man.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you give me leave to ask you how often have you spoken of this business, since you was at Bow-street? - I cannot say that.</p>

            Have you ever said that if the prisoner would advance a sum of money, of fifty guineas, you would keep out of the way, crelse when you came on the trial you would so prevaricate as your evidence should be or no force? - Never.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know a man of the name of Tucker? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you make such a proposal to Tucker? - I did not, on my oath; I never made any overt re, I never would say any thing, or give him an answer on that; the gentleman, the prisoner, said that he would give fifty guineas, and go out of England as fast as ever the coach could take him, if we would clear him; when he said this, he had the room cleared of all but the constable, and them that belonged to the business; I told him I dare not do it.</p>

               <p>Court. Do you believe the prisoner was drunk? - I don't know that he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he appear to be much in liquor? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you say about Tucker? - Tucker told me that no money would be wanted, if I would only come to terms, and not appear to any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. Who is Tucker? - Tucker is a postilion at the Bell Savage inn, Ludgatehill.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray had the man, whom you pursued, a hat on his head? - Yes, he had when I catched him the first time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that after you catched him at the side of the coach? - Yes. I did not see any hat fall off, but there was a hat laying by the coach.</p>

             sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a coach painter, this man worked for the same master, Mr. Edmonson, as I do. On Saturday the 21st of last month, he and I were sent out to work, he was to assist me, the prisoner is a labourer, he used to grind colours; I sent him up to the barn, which is Mr. Edmonson's shop, in Mary-le-bone-fields, while I went home to get my breakfast; I had my breakfast, and went to see for him up there, and he was not there.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you return? -  About a quarter before nine in the morning; I had left him in King-street, Golden-square; I supposed he was gone to breakfast, he comes in a little time after, he said he had been at breakfast, and Mr. Edmonson came, and he set me about another job, and this man and I did it; then he went away again, and I saw no more of him for about an hour, and he came back again and brought his boy with him, a lad about ten years of age; I wanted him to lend me a hand, to pull and haul the carriage, I asked him where he had been? he came and just went away again, then he went up stairs into the lost, I did not see him go up into the lost, but I heard him as I was at work underneath; there was nobody but he and I in the barn, and they could not get in without my seeing of him; I wondered who it was making a noise over my head, I hallooed out to him to lend me a hand to get the fore carriage under, and he comes down stairs, and he made rather a noise coming down the ladder, and I saw him bring this glass out, and I saw him put it behind a folding door, he had but this one that I saw.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he brought it from? - From one corner of the lost.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the glass standing? -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150191"/>In the lost, but in a convenient place for safety.</p>
               <p>Q. You was in the shop at that time? - I was in the shop at the same time.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he knew that you could see what he was about? - I don't know for that; I wanted him to assist me and he came to me rather fatigued, and said will you have any gin? he said he had had half a pint; I said I have drank one or two glasses this morning. I did not with to have any more. Mr. Bishop's public house joins to the shop, I went in to the mistress of the house, and asked her if she had any looking glasses in the barn? she said she had; she came in along with me; I told her that man had brought one down stairs; he said he knew nothing about it. I told him, what a wicked man you must be to deny it, when I saw you bring it down stairs. The boy was standing right facing of him while he was coming down stairs; this is the glass.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the glass after it was put behind the door? - Bishop took it from behind the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you kept that glass till now? - Yes, I have.</p>
               <p>Court to Bishop. You said, if I understand you right, three glasses were missing? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing about the other two glasses? have you ever found them? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put these glasses yourself in that lost? - Yes, in a private place, three months ago.</p>

            When did you see him? - Not till I found that this glass was brought down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the glass behind the door? - I did</p>
               <p>Court to Pickering. Did you observe whether he was drunk or sober? - He was rather in liquor, but he knew what he was about.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I never see the prosecutor but the last fortnight that he worked at my master's, I have worked for him ever since last June. My master, Mr Edmonson sent me up to the barn and ordered me to take some coals with me to dry a carriage (I lodge in Grosvenor-street, Golden-square) I went up to this lost for some light wood to light the fire, and I brought down this glass in my hand with some light wood; with that my prosecutor sent me to order a quartern of gin, and then he went out himself and came in again and brought Mrs. Bishop. I took the glass in one hand, and the old wood in the other to light the fire, I brought it down for safety, I thought it would be liable to be broke there, I thought it was my master's, I did not know that it belonged to Mr. Bishop, I have no witnesses, Pickering told Mrs. Bishop that I moved the glass with an intent of stealing it.</p>
               <p>Q. Court to Pickering. Did you see him bring down any fire wood? - Not a bit, he went up there for to light the fire, he did not light it, and when I went up there I light it myself.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. My prosecutor he owed me some spite or other, and I could not make out what it was; it is not two sessions ago that he was tried here himself for thieving the colour of Mr. Creece.</p>
               <p>Court to Pickering. Is that true or false? was there any charge against you for stealing any colour? - I was tried here and was cleared.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before? - No, I did not; I met her pretty near Broad-street, St. Giles's, she asked me where I was going? I told her I was going home; says she, will you go home along with me? I asked her where she lived? she said not far from here; I asked her if she had got an apartment of her own? she said yes. It being after my usual hour of being out of a Saturday night I did not like to disturb the people where I lodged, I agreed to go with her, she took me to her apartment; I did not like it, it was in <placeName id="t17940115-72-crimeloc387">Dyot-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. What did you pay for the bed? - I paid a shilling for the bed to the woman of the house. When I went in, as I suppose, I had about fifteen or sixteen shillings, I went to bed and sell fast asleep, never locked the room.</p>

            Was you sick? - No. The woman told her she had not got a bottle, but she would let her have something else, accordingly she let her have something else, and she never returned; so the woman of the house suspected that I might be robbed, and she said to the watchman, I dare say the young man up stairs is robbed, the woman has come down stairs and said she wanted a vessel to get him something to drink, so the woman of the house described the person to the watchman and asked him if he knew her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the woman yourself? -  Yes, I am certain that is the woman. The watchman and the woman of the house came up stairs about five o'clock.</p>

            Then what happened between the hours of twelve and five you don't know? - I am certain she did not come to bed, because she was never in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. All that you know is that at five o'clock you missed your money? - It was all gone but one shilling. I know I had something about me under a pound, but not much.</p>

            When was she taken up? - A little before six in the morning. I gave charge of her, and the watchman took her to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you gave this woman only one shilling? - Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>DANIEL HOGAN sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a watchman. On the 8th of last month, which was of a Sunday, a little after five, I was called by a woman into the house where this robbery was committed. I came to the woman and she said she dare say there was a man up stairs that was robbed of some money; I went up stairs and spoke to the prosecutor, and asked him how much money he had lost? he was in bed asleep, it was on the first floor, the one pair of stairs, I believe, I am not positive; I asked him how much he had lost? he said half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you apprehend the woman? - Within a quarter to six, at the running horse in Tottenham-court-road, along with three or four men a drinking; I brought her to the same house, and the prosecutor he gave charge of her; I brought them both to the watch-house, and the watch-house keeper searched her and found five or six shillings on her, and a remarkable half crown, which the prosecutor swore to.</p>
               <p>- sworn.</p>
               <p>I am watch house keeper at St. Giles's; about six o'clock on Sunday, Hogan brought this prisoner to me, I searched her and found five shillings and a half crown; I put the money on the table and the prosecutor says, if there is a half crown with a hole on the tail side it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that before he saw it? - Yes, he could not see the tail side because the tail side was on the table. I immediately turned the half crown up so, and I shewed it him, says he, that is my half crown.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. This is the same half crown, it is mine, I am certain of it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Honoured gentlemen, pardon me an unhappy widow, if I should state my defence in writing, as my health is very much impaired by being in gaol this six weeks, which I believe will terminate in my ruin, having neither friend nor relation to assist me, and this unfortunate affair proceeds entirely from malice. Honoured gentlemen, I was robbed of eighteen guineas some time ago, which was to carry me to Scotland, my native place. This man, the prosecutor, is an acquaintance of the person who robbed me, whom he has put in my way to bring me into trouble. I met this man in Oxford-road, where I supped with him, he made me a present of half a crown to buy me a pair of gloves; he afterwards offered to sleep with me, which I refused, he being incensed at this repulse, immediately charged the watch with me, and I am the unhappy sufferer; I hope you will take my case into consideration; the society I have been among for these six weeks, being to me a representative of the lower regions; may God keep me from such, and I hope you will be made the instrument of keeping me out of inevitable ruin; and the heavens will shower his blessings on you. I have no witnesses.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I am sure I did not give her this half crown.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know her before? - No, I never saw her to my knowledge.</p>

            Did you perceive that wood was missing? - Yes, the prisoner lives in the same street, about one hundred yards off; he is a shoe maker, he lives in Bembridge-street, No. 3. I live in Great Russel street, Bloomsbury. Friday night, the 10th of January, I was sent for to the brewhouse and had some information that made me apply for a search warrant, I got one on Saturday morning, about eleven o'clock, I went with it to the prisoner's house, and two officers were with me, we went into the front room, the parlour, where the prisoner was making shoes, his wife desired the officer to tell what he wanted, he was present, I do not recollect that he said any thing that time, she said the would bring it him if she had it, the officer asked if they had any timber or wood.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that loud enough for the prisoner to hear? - It was, then she fetched the key of the kitchen, she said she had some in the kitchen, we went to the kitchen door together and I went out into the yard, the prisoner we left in the front room behind, and I went into the yard, and there I saw two pieces of timber, joist fir timber, I immediately said that it belonged to Mr. Stevenson's and Co.'s brewhouse; I said that, and the prisoner immediately answered and said, that was the only two pieces he had from the brewhouse, I am certain that he said that one of them the bricklayer gave to him; he said his name was Hogan. I asked him if he knew Hogan, the bricklayer? these were found across the yard, on the top of the yard; after that we went into the kitchen, and he followed us, as we went down under the stairs, there we perceived a large quantity more, they handed it out to me, and directly as I put my hand on the timber I said I knew it to be Mr. Stevenson's property; they are called tye pieces; there were some boards also lay at the bottom of the stairs, there was a large quantity that I had not the least doubt but what it belongs to Mr. Stevenson's, though I had no particular marks for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Now having looked down stairs where else did you go? - We went into the back yard again, and there are two little sheds, one on the left and one on the right, that on the right hand the door was open, we looked into it, nothing was there at all; the prisoner was there in the yard at this time, and when the officer asked him what was in the other? he said that he had let that place to an old woman and she was gone out, there was nothing there. The officers began to break the door open, he said as I was a carpenter I knew better how to get the door open; we opened the door and there we saw a large quantity of wood more, this was not all fir, there were two oak planks, about eight feet long each of them. I had no particular mark for them myself.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you go to execute the search warrant at the prisoner's house? - Yes, on the 11th of this month. When I went into the house I saw the prisoner at the bar and his wife, I told them I had a search warrant to search for stolen property; his wife made answer, what was it? I told her it was timber; says she, here is the key I will shew you some timber that we have got. I went down to the kitchen, and there was a quantity of timber that she had got, Mr. Godfry was along with me, and he pointed out what timber belonged to Mr. Stevenson, I think we found ten pieces about two or three yards long, there was some flooring and other thick pieces of wood, in the yard there was a very large piece there, Mr. Godfry said that belonged to Mr. Stevenson; the prisoner was in the front parlour at that time, in custody with another officer.</p>

            While he was in the yard did he say any thing? - He did say something, but I cannot recollect what it was; here was a little house, there was no person in it, but only an old woman that lodged in it, the windows were broke, I looked in at the windows, and I saw a great deal of timber in it, I burst open the door; which wood found there, the carpenter said belonged to Mr. Stevenson, that is all that I know about it; I think it was the prisoner said that an old woman lodged in it; there was a fire place in it, but no appearance of a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. You talk of an officer being with the prisoner, had the prisoner any opportunity of making his escape, if he had been so inclined? - No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Do you know whether any body lodged in this house, besides the old woman? - This was in the yard, but I dare say there were lodgers in the house, both men and women.</p>
               <p>Q. Of course these men and women that lodge in the house had access to all parts of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Then this place in the yard had the appearance of a lodging house, because there was a fire place? - Yes.</p>
               <p>CONSTANT HOGAN sworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you at any time at work on these premises of Mr. Stevenson's? - Yes, I am a bricklayer, I know the prisoner at the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the search warrant took place did you see the prisoner on the premises at any time? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any conversation passed between you? - Yes, he asked me for a piece of joist that lay there.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of wood was it? - Fir; it lay on the outer part of the bottom scaffold.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say what he wanted it for? - He said he was going to build a shed, I told him he should not have it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you afterwards change your mind, and give it him? - No, I did not give it him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any time give him any wood? - No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - It might be about half after eleven, two or three days before it was found in his house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what became of that piece afterwards; did it remain there? - When I came back from dinner that day, I missed it, in the course of the afternoon I met the prisoner, he came opposite the building as usual; I said to him I perceive you have taken that piece? no, says he, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you charged him with having taken it, and he denied it? how long was this before he was taken up? - A day, or two, or three.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the piece of timber again? - I see it when it was brought back in the caravan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where the caravan came from? - I see it set down in the street.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know this labouring man again? - No, it I was to see him again I should know him. She asked him what was the price of it? but he said she was to give him the price of a pot of beer, and his master would call in a little time, and set a price on the wood; then she puts her hand into her pocket and gave him some halfpence, whether it was three-pence or four-pence, I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of timber was it? - It was a long piece, about sixteen or seventeen feet long, it had been used before.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with timber? was it fir timber? - It was fir, to the best of my knowledge, one piece was deal, but the others I cannot say; the man after putting this down went away, and he came in again in five or six minutes, and asked no questions; and went through the passage, leaving some more pieces, and laid them in the yard, and there he left them and went out again.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what wood they were? - I went along with a young fellow that worked along with me, and I saw a piece in the yard, one round piece, with a piece of iron nailed to the end of it, another piece that had been used, smashed down at one end.</p>

After a few minutes he said he did not want to behave ill to me, or any gentleman, he would take his wages; I paid him two pounds seven shillings and three-pence for the six weeks, presently afterwards he went; I did not know that he was gone for good till I made an enquiry of one of our men, when I was informed he had taken his clothes, as I was giving him instructions to take care that he left his clothes behind.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know of your own knowledge, that he took them away? - Yes, as you shall find presently. This was on Monday, I thought that he would recollect himself on Tuesday and return them; on Wednesday morning I sent after him, he had lived two years at Islington, and I thought I should have scent of him in some of the public houses there, which I did; he came with our man to the house, the moment I saw him I said young man, you and I must go to Bow-street; he had no objection he said, and I gave him a little time to consider of it; I went into the counting house, and there I stopped for about five or ten minutes, when I came out I said to him, will you or will you not give up the clothes? he said he would not, he consented to give all up but one suit, the suit he went away in. We went to Bow-street together, I told my story, and he in justification of himself said that I gave him the clothes, this was a new livery made within four days after he came.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you given him the clothes? - No, I had not, I was to give him eighteen guineas a year, and two suits of clothes.</p>

               <p>On the 6th of this month, the prisoner at the bar, went out about one o'clock (I live with Mr. Kastevan) and he came home rather intoxicated with liquor; my master found he was not able to do his work, came down into the shop, the prisoner soon followed him; my master paid him his wages, he mentioned something about a months wages; he went up stairs and he came down again, he went down stairs again to the kitchen to the family, and master went up stairs to dinner, we in the shop were shutting up the shop, and the prisoner went away with the things while we were shutting up the shop. On Wednesday morning following, I was sent by master to see if I could find him at Islington, I went to two public houses, at one of the houses I was informed that he was gone to Dr. Saunders's, at Highbury.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150202"/>I went to Dr. Saunders's and did ask for him there, but I found him at a public house in Islington, he was sitting down drinking some purl with his friend, reading the news Paper; when he saw me he said, John are you come after me, I made him an answer that I was, he said he was looking in the paper to see if he could see any thing about any place; he asked me what my master said about him? I told him he was surprised he did not return the clothes home, he made an answer, that my master had given him the clothes, and that he would not return any of them except the great coat, which he would return if he would give him a month's wages; he took this hat off his head, and said he cannot hurt me, I know a young man that has done the like; he came along with me, coming home the other side of Sadler's Wells, he said if I had stopped a little longer, he had been off in the country, and I should not have seen any more of him; from thence I took him to my master's shop, and there were a few words passed between him and master's brother, but I was not present at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. knap. When you saw him go out you was shutting up the shop? - Yes, and during the time master was at dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. You heard the prisoner then talking about a month's wages? - He did not say any thing about a month's wages, he said he would take the clothes away unless master would pay him a month's wages.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he had an idea that he was entitled to these clothes? - I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not he say, when his master had refused to pay him his month's wages. that he would then take his clothes? - He said he would then take his clothes if in case he did not have the month's wages.</p>

            He meant another servant did not he? - I took it in that light.</p>
               <p>Q. From that you understood that he meant it was the custom of servants so to do? - I took it in that light.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp addressed the court, that under the circumstances of this case, there was no case to go to a jury. But the court thought otherwise. And the prisoner called four witnesses who gave him a good character.</p>

On the 12th of last month I was ill and not able to leave the lodgings and go to work as usual; between eight and nine in the evening of that day, Wilson came into the room and took the candle to go into the yard and then went and brought a bed in, declaring this, that as her father would not furnish her she was resolved to get furniture for her room; and then as she was going down stairs I heard her say, God bless you mother; which I thought the meant her mother, then she came again into Shepherd's room bringing more things; on which I got out of bed and insisted on Shepherd's going to ask her mother if she was giving her the things; and the returned and said that she had been her mother, and that she said she had given her the things. I heard a noise below stairs, after this I started up and put on my great coat,

             wanted to go out of the room, I told her I would not have the door locked, nor let her go till I knew what was the matter; immediately her father came in, which I asked if them things where his that were brought there? he answered they were not his, and I was taken into custody and was scarce allowed time to put my clothes on. And then before the justices next day the prisoners declared that I knew nothing of the matter, and the prosecutor said that she believed me to be an honest harmless man and had nothing to lay to my charge, but for what reason I cannot tell I was committed; I also beg leave to say that I did not take the lodging nor pay the rent, I only generally live with Shepherd when I came to town, this is the real state of my case, which I humbly submit to your lordship, hoping no kind of selony will appear on my part.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Wilson. This afternoon that the place was broke open, my father and I had a few words, this Mrs. Shepherd asked me to go and have a pint of beer, I went with her to the public house, and I saw Mrs. Ferris there very much intoxicated with liquor, with one Mrs. Bowyer, she takes hold of me and says, O, what you have brought yourself to; O, says I, my father has turned me out of doors to work at the gun barrels; so after that she treated me with a glass of liquor and then she goes out to the Blue Anchor and there she began quarrelling, and I took

Mrs. Shepherd goes out to a chandler's shop and gets some liquor, and she gave me some, and her husband some, with that I turns out of the room and said I will be back again presently, with that I found by going that my mistress was in bed, and I went back to this room and Mrs. Ferril was on the stairs, and I saw the furniture then in the room, and this man was laying on that<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150207"/>woman's bed; with that Mrs. Ferril went out, I cannot say where the went; afterwards, the man Ferril was laying on the bed, and Mrs. Ferril called to me and said, give me a light; I went to her and I said, have you been buying any goods? yes, says the, I have been, because Mrs. Ferris wants to go to Portsmouth; after that I went up stairs and I heard a great alarm presently, and my father, that is there, Michael Brown, he comes up stairs, and Mr Parsh, that keeps the Windmill, was one of the two men that went into the room, and the watchman, and they took this man and woman, and me.</p>

Why my mother, says this young woman. Then by and by the chairs came up; I started up, and said, I would not put up with all this here, I must know the rights of it; says I to this woman; you go down stairs, and go to this girl's mother and know the rights of this affair. Accordingly she went down and told me it was all right: then they went down again and stopped and brought the stove; afterwards I heard a noise in the court, and I observed they put the candle out directly; I said, what is this? here is some mischief; Mr. Brown was the first man that entered the room; says I to Mr. Brown, are these your property that your daughter,

             sworn.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of this month I was at Mr. Lee's, a stationer, in Compton-street, the house is situated with a corner that is round, and one side of the door was shut, and the other open; I was in the back room, and standing by the fire side; a man came into the fore shop, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150208"/>asked for a half pennyworth of paper, and he looked where I was, and he said, there is a dancing master; they said, no; I came out of the back room and saw a man at the door that was shut up, the side of Greek-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean he was the outside of the door next to Greek-street, behind the door? - Yes.</p>
               <p>

            Is the door that leads into Greek-street a solding door? - Yes. I saw the man behind the half door that was shut, as I was coming out, and so I went to come out by the door that was open, and then he fell on me, and struck me, and laid hold of the chain of my watch and threw me down, having the chain of my watch in his hand; but having a button to my fob he could not get the watch out, but he got the entire chain. It was a gold chain with three gold seals, and two gold keys; the whole cost me upwards of fifteen guineas, the chain cost me about six guineas, one seal, my coat of arms, cost me five guineas engraving, and a guinea and a half setting. I know the man.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you observe the man that robbed you? - Being on the ground I called out stop thief! and the man was immediately taken, within two or three doors from where he committed the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see him before he was taken? - I took notice of him at the time that he fell on me and struck me, but not so far that I could be positive to his face, but I am positive to his dress, which was a very dark brown, and his hair was remarkable, came down half way of his face, such as he appears to be now.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say any thing more with respect to the person of the man that robbed you? - No, I cannot say any thing more.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Was it a foggy evening? - No, quite a clear night, there was a lamp at the door.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you your spectacles on at the time? - No, I can see very well, but not to read any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the person who robbed you before you was pushed down? - No, I see his back, and then I thought it was Mr. Lee's man, who was there ready to open my chariot door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you quite thrown down? - Quite flat, and very much hurt in my knee, which I feel the pain now at this present time.</p>
               <p>Q. There was a man came in and asked if you was a dancing master? Did you make any particular observations on that man? - No, I did not see him at all.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your carriage at the door? - My carriage was in Greek-street, but the horses were almost a head to the door; if the coachman had been in Compton-street he would have been the whole affair, but he saw nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. What age are you? - Eighty next August.</p>

             sworn;</p>
               <p>I lodge at the house of Mr. Lee, stationer, in Compton-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Pray did you happen to be in the shop at the time this accident took place? - I went to wait on Mr. Belliard out of doors; I observed a man within side of the doors; I had been called out by a little girl to come into the shop, supposing he wanted to buy something; the man was inside of the door that was shut to, in the shop, on the steps, it was a folding door one half shut; his right hand was against the part of the door that was shut, and with his left hand he endeavoured to shut that door that was open, to force Mr. Belliard out, which by the force of his pushing the door he fell into Compton-street; the double door looks into both streets, it is a round door, and one part<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150209"/>looks into Compton-street, and the other in Greek-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What followed? - The man picked him up at the same time, and at that time, I suppose he took the chain. Mr. Belliard then said, he has picked my pocket; the man immediately ran, and I called stop thief!</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing this man before you went out? - No. I cried stop thief in the street; I see his face sufficient at the time that he picked Mr. Belliard up, to know, when taken, that he was the man that threw him down.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive as to the person of the man? - No, I am not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you positive that the person that was taken, was the man that you saw with Mr. Belliard? - I am; I observed that he was particularly pale, that his hair was at that time loose, and very low on his cheeks.</p>
               <p>Q. You are quite certain that the man that was afterwards taken was the man that threw Mr. Belliard down? - I am very certain.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe the prisoner to be the man? - I believe he is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that he is the man? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. You say you are positive as to the man that threw this gentleman down? - I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that you don't know that to be the same man? - I hardly saw him enough to swear to him at this distance of time.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell me in what time he was brought back? - In five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. You lost sight of him then? - I did.</p>

               <p>Mr. Knowlys. This house is round at the corner, but one side is Greek-street, and the other is Compton-street? - It is.</p>
               <p>Q. So this person might have run up Greek-street, towards Soho Square, gone down Greek-street, towards Newpart Market, Compton-street, or towards Carnaby Market? - He might.</p>
               <p>Court. Is there four different ways from these houses? - There is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. So that at this spot where Mr. Belliard was thrown down, they might have taken four courses? - They might.</p>
               <p>Q. My friend asked you if you observed the man do this? and the answer you gave was, no; I dare say you remember it.</p>

               <p>Court. The question was, did you observe the man in the shop? - I remember saying that the man was within side the door, but I had not an opportunity of seeing his face, because his back was towards me.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. You said the man was within side the door with his right hand or left was it, that he pulled the door to? - With his left hand, with his back towards the counter, within side of the half door that was shut.</p>
               <p>Q. Then on shutting the door within side of the shop he endeavoured to shut the door on himself, and Mr. Belliard? - Yes, at the same time to prevent, as I supposed, me from coming out.</p>
               <p>Court. Explain that about his hand? - The door was open on his left hand side of coming out of the shop, his right hand against the part of the door that was shut, his hand was about Mr. Belliard, and he endeavoured to shut the door on himself; and Mr. Belliard at the same time, and pulled the door to after him, there is only one step.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Then what Mr. Belliard said that he was waiting outside of that part of that door that he shut at the time he got out is not correct? - He may mistake.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Belliard is not correct that the man was outside of the door when he went out? - Not in that point.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you be so good as to look to that man at the bar, I believe you do not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150210"/>find that his hair is not very much over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. That hair is curled, I believe you will find I shall be able to convince you that his hair is in the same situation as it always was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you find that to be the case of his hair now? - I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then that which attracted your attention to the man's person was the hair being so much over the face? - From the size of the man altogether. I see him a moment or two before he threw Mr. Belliard down, but I see his face when he listed Mr. Belliard up.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing his hair is not in the same situation in which it was on this day, he is not the man? - He is not.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you was a good deal slurried on this occasion? - I was at seeing Mr. Belliard thrown down.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe so much frightened that when you saw Mr. Belliard thrown down you screamed out? - I did.</p>
               <p>Q. And till the man was listing Mr. Belliard up, you had no opportunity of seeing his face? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that the man that threw Mr. Belliard down listed him up likewise? - I am sure of that</p>
               <p>Q. Did you direct any body to look up that part of the street that looked towards Soho? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Or any passage but that one you thought the man ran by? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever search has been made after these seals and chain, they never have been found at all? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. I don't know whether the prisoner was searched in your presence, when he was taken? - He was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go to Bow-street? - I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Did you observe in point of fact which way the man did run? - Up Old Compton street towards Princes-street.</p>
               <p>NICHOLAS DAWKINS sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a footman to the Dutchess of Bedford.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe you was in Compton-street last Thursday seven night, in the evening, between five and six? - I was walking very fast towards Dean-street, Soho, I got past Mr. Lee's, on the opposite side of the way I heard the cry of stop thief, I turned my head and I saw the man run from Mr. Lee's door, he might be the space of one house from the door before I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he going in the same line as you was? - He was, only it was the other side of the way, I ran across directly, in about five or six doors I stopped him and had him back to Mr. Lee's.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the street in which you saw him? - In Compton-street, and Mr. Belliard said that he believed he was the man that robbed him of his chain.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any lady there when you carried him back? - There was Mrs. Bemsleet; she said the believed he was the man; she said the thought it was the same by his black hair and his face being so very pale; the watchman took charge of him directly, and took him to the watch house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say any thing? - When I got him and he was going along, he said he was not the man, I threw him against some shutters that jetted out at the corner, about five doors from Mr. Lee's, he was not searched in my presence, he said he was not the thief, he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know the man that you secured if you was to see him? - I am positive he is the man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. There is no doubt but what he is the man that you stopped, you had not the curiosity to look up Greek-street, whether there was any body running that way? - I had not.</p>
               <p>Q. He had past Mr. Lee's door when you saw him? - He had about one door and I rushed across, and in about five doors I stopped him.</p>

Was he to go any where else besides the washerwoman? - I cannot say, he did not mention, but I believe afterwards he went for flax; he was using my flax all the day; it is a custom to lend one another our flax, when our flax is out, until we have an opportunity of going out.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know where he got his flax? - No, I don't know, sometimes at one place, and sometimes at another, where ever we get it bad one time, we make a point of going to another place the next time, to see if we can get it better.</p>
               <p>Court to Mrs. Bemfleet. You did not state before whether there were any lights in the shop? - There were two candles on the counter.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at his hair, is his hair in the same state as when he left you that night, to go to his washerwoman's? - It is in the same curl as to the sides, and if he was to let it loose behind, it would curl the same.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rains. He left work about four o'clock; about what time did you first hear of his being in custody? - About six o'clock, as near as I can recollect.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether his hair was tied or loose that day? - Sometimes he used to tie it, and sometimes it was loose; as to the length over his cheeks, it is the same as it was then.</p>

I let the prisoner at the bar a ready furnished room on the 4th of January, she came to my house to take the lodgings, and we went for her character, she was to pay half a crown a week, she did not come into the lodgings till the Monday, that was the 6th, she continued there until Thursday, the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pay for her lodgings before she went? - No, she went out about two o'clock, with the key on her finger, and went down the lane, I went up to look into the room, and when I came into the room the bed was cut open, and a quantity of feathers about the room, and the articles in the indictment were missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these articles let to her with the lodgings? - Yes. About five o'clock that evening she came to a neighbour's house opposite; a woman sent over to my wife, that she was there, and my wife went over and asked the prisoner for a flat iron, and she said she would come and give it her, my wife had lent her a flat iron that very morning; I was not present, she was taken before the justice that afternoon, and the justice of Worship-street turned her over to the City constable. That same night, Thursday night, about nine or ten o'clock all the articles that I have got, where found at one pawnbroker's; some articles are not found yet.</p>

               <p>I am a pawnbroker; I produce some of the things which I took in of the prisoner, two sheets, a blanket, and a bolster, a flat iron, a pair of bellows, and a frying pan.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her person before? - No, I did not; but she brought these things several times; I have no doubt about her person, I am positive.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lend her money on them? - Yes. The sheets were brought the 6th of January, the blanket was brought the same day, the bolster was brought on the 8th, the bellows and iron the 9th, the frying pan on the 7th. I lent her money on them all.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. You had let all these things with the room? - Yes, I am sure of that; they are my things.</p>

My name is Ann Parman, and not Ann Palmer, the wife of William Parman, of Old-street; my husband for<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150215"/>some time has lived in a criminal way with another woman, and turned me out of doors destitute, with the allowance of eighteen-pence a week; I took the ready furnished lodging with intent to get work, and while I brought in several things with intent to light a fire, I was gone out, and come back again, and to my great surprise I found my room door open, by means of my landlord having a second key to the room. I have children, and am now pregnant, and humbly beg the mercy of the court. This is my defence and it is truth.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of the day was this? - On Sunday about ten o'clock; we generally lost them on a Sunday, because the yard is more retired that day than any other day. Where he was there is a division between two stables, it is a small yard in the yard his horses stood in the back stable; the prisoner was carter to me at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him wring off the neck of this turkey? - In the stable where his horses stood, which he usually drove. After he had killed it he hid it under some litter, I see him, then I fetched my foreman, and ordered him to fetch Croker the constable; I waited outside of the gates to watch that he could not go out, and when Croker came we could not find the turkey under the litter; Croker found it tied up in a truss of straw in the same stable; that is all I know about it; Croker has kept it ever since.</p>

               <p>On this 29th of December, Mr. Rhodes sent for me, I went to the place where he saw the turkey hid, and it was not there; I saw a truss of straw laying in the stable where him and I stood, and it struck me it might be in the straw, I put my hand into the straw, and there I felt it warm, and I took it out, and I have kept it ever since; the neck is broke.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. What may be the value of that turkey? - I suppose it is worth six or seven shillings, we never sell any of them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I came home with my team about ten o'clock in the day, with a load of grains; after I had been in the stable about half an hour, or a little better I was called in, and Mr. Rhodes came along with me, and said to me you go and fetch that turkey; how? says I, what turkey? I know nothing of the turkey; he says, I will find him, says he, I know where it is, I see him carry it away; he went and searched in the lost, and it was not there, and Croker pulled him out of the straw that was in the stable. There was another man went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150216"/>backward and forward with a team of horses, he was in the stable all the time; it was very odd he could not see any thing about it, my master himself went in there two or three times, it is very odd he did not come to me at the time. The turkey was there in the straw before ever I came home with the cart; the whole time that I was there was not half an hour.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. When did you confine this man? - It is a customary thing with us whenever the brewhouse has the grains ready we fetch them away; we pay not that attention that we ought to the day or hour. This man had been out on Sunday morning for the grains, and he had come in with them.</p>

               <p>Q. Were there three of them? - Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they cotton? - Yes, I believe they are, I am sure they are? I sent a little child on an errand, and the comes back and says, mother has any body been down for any linen? I said no; she said then mother you are robbed; I then went down to see, and I missed these waistcoats, I went into the street and I followed them by the water that ran from them, I went up and got a candle and saw the water had ran from them as far as the rails in the area. I saw the things the same night in the constable's hands (Warren)</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner in your house? - I did not.</p>

               <p>I am a constable belonging to the public office, in Marlborough-street. On the 24th of December Mrs. Johnson's son came to our office, and said that his mother had been robbed of some linen, about seven o'clock; I found the prisoner in David's street, Grosvenor-square, but I did not take him there; I did not take him till I came to Chandler's-street; this was near about ten o'clock on Christmas Eve; I did not know whether it was the same lad or no, but I found him with this cundle of wet linen under his arm and I took him into custody and took him to Mary-le-bone watch house.</p>

            Did you lose any cotton handkerchiefs? - Yes, I believe these to be them, one is what I split in two for the children.</p>
               <p>Warren. I found three on him, two in the bundle, and one in his pocket.</p>
               <p>Court to Prosecutor. As to these handkerchiefs and waistcoat, where they your own property or things that you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179401150217"/>took in to wash? - One waistcoat is my own property, and the others is not; I can swear to that which is mine, as to the others they belong to the people that I wash for.</p>
               <p>-BEDFORD sworn.</p>
               <p>I am a hair dresser; I had sent four waistcoats to be washed to Mrs. Johnson's and these are three of them, I have pieces that are left and they exactly answer, they are all different patterns, I have pieces of patterns of two of them; of one I had observed that the first or second button was off, and likewise this striped waistcoat, there was a button off, on the right side; I have no doubt whatever of their being mine.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Please you my lord, I was coming down Davis-street, and I met two young fellows, I had been in company with them before, and they asked me if I would go and have something to drink? and I went to the Rodney's Head, in Chandler's-street; and after that I went to market, afterwards I met them again and when they met me they asked me to hold the bundle for the value of five minutes, and I wanted to buy a piece of meat, and that man followed me to the butcher's shop and took me into custody.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any of these witnesses here who gave you the bundle? - No.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any other witnesses? - No.</p>
