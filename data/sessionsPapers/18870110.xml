                  </hi>. I am barmaid at the Crown public-house, 64, Cleveland Street, St. Pancras—on 6th December, about 4 p.m., the prisoner came in with a young man and called for some liquor, price 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and tendered a sovereign; I put it on a shelf where there was no other coin and gave him 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change, and they left—the landlady spoke to me at 5 o'clock and I looked at the coin and found it was bad—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—between 7 and 8 o'clock the same evening the prisoner came again with a young man, who called for some rum and some whisky; I served the rum, and while the landlady was serving the whisky the young man knocked over the rum, and as I was getting something to wipe it up I saw the prisoner standing behind a partition—I spoke to the landlady, and then said to the prisoner "Are you aware you gave mo a sovereign this afternoon?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Are you aware what it was?"—he said "Yes; I will come round and speak to you"—he then ran away, and the young man went out of the bar at the same time; the landlady and the potman followed them—I gave the sovereign to the constable at the police-station—the rum and whisky were not paid for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can't say how far Fitzroy Square is from our house because I have only been there six weeks—it is a rule when gold is taken across the counter to put in on the mantelpiece—I was very busy and did not notice this coin—on the first occasion they did not holt out of the house the moment I gave them, the change; they remained about half an hour—no one was serving except me—there were other customers in the bar with them, but they could not see the money tendered across the counter, because they were up in a corner—in the evening they came into the private bar which I attended to—the coin was not like this when I got it, the gilding has been rubbed off the edge since.</p>

                  </hi>. I am potman at the Crown public-house, Cleveland Street—on 6th December, between 7 and 8 p.m., I saw the prisoner there—I did not see him come in—he was standing in the middle of the private bar; I saw no one else with him—I did not hear the conversation—about 7.20 I saw him run out—the landlady spoke to me, and she and I followed them—the prisoner went up London Street, and the other man up Cleveland Street—we followed the prisoner about 200 yards, and I caught him outside the Yorkshire Grey, at the corner of London Street, and said "I want you for changing counterfeit coin in the Crown public-house"—I caught him by his left arm, which? was towards the houses—he said "What do you want me for?"—I detained him till a constable came, and the landlady charged him with changing a bad sovereign in her house—before I got up to him I saw him put his hand in his right-hand pocket and wave his arm; that was about 50 yards past the house—it was a dark night.</p>

I keep the Crown public-house, Cleveland Street—on 6th December, about 6 p.m., I came into the bar to collect the money, and spoke to the barmaid about a coin supposed to be a sovereign which I found there—I believe this to be it; it was not so much worn then—about 10 minutes to 8 o'clock I was in the bar-parlour, and Miss Watkins spoke to me—I went into the bar and saw the prisoner—he had caught hold of the handle of the door, and was moving out—he said to Miss Watkins "I will come round and speak to you," but he moved to the right instead of the left, where she was—I saw him leave, and followed him with the potman—he ran up London Street—I did not see him stopped, but I gave him in custody, and charged him with passing a counterfeit sovereign at my house in the afternoon—he made no remark—I was close behind him—he held an umbrella in his right hand—I did not see him make any movement with his hands.</p>

I am assistant to Mr. Smith, a pawn-broker, at Upper Street, Islington—on the evening of 10th December, about a quarter to six, I saw the first three prisoners outside the shop looking in the window at a corner case of jewellery; they stayed there two or three minutes and then the woman came in the shop with a baby in her arms and said, "Can you change me a post-office order?"—I said "We don't do such a thing as a rule, you had better go over to the post-office "—she said, "It is too late," she could not get it after four o'clock—I then said I would see what I could do, and she then said "I want to buy an 'Albert' for my husband," and selected one at 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and produced this order with this letter—I took it with the letter and showed it to my employer in the next shop, and we then saw that it had been altered—my master gave me some directions, and I went to the door of the shop and saw the two men in the centre of the pavement looking into the doorway—I came back and said "It is no use taking the woman, as I am sure there are two men outside concerned in it"—I then went outside again and spoke to a policeman, and then went back to the shop, leaving the policeman outside—I then asked the woman her name and address, and I think she said "Mary Titcomb, John Street, Liverpool Road "—an assistant in the shop named Dodd then asked the woman in my presence, "Do you know the two men outside?"—she said, "No, this order was given to mo by a gentleman outside to get cashed, and he was going to give me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—at that point two constables came into the shop with Knapton and Seymour, and the woman turned round to Sey<lb/>mour as if she knew him and said, "This was given me outside by a man</p>

I am a police constable attached to the General Post-office—on 10th December a communication was made to me with regard to this case, and about midnight I went to Upper Street, Islington, Police-station, and there saw the female prisoner—I said to her "I am a detective officer from the General Post-office; I understand why you have been brought here, and I am told you are desirous of making a statement; you can say what you like to me, but what you say I shall take down in writing, and it may be used in evidence against you"—I then took down</p>

               <p>this statement. (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Annie Peace, 23, Little Canterbury Place Lambeth Walk, Lambeth. I have lived there about five weeks. I am single, a cook out of place. I have known the prisoner Seymour for about 14 months; he was working as a gasfitter. The man Knapton I have only known for a short time since I have lived in Lambeth; he in a gas<lb/>fitter by trade. Seymour came home one day, he knocked me about, I had black-eyes. He brought an order to me one day; it was made out I believe for 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. He asked me to go and get it cashed. I said Where did you get it?' and he said 'Mind your own business.' I eventually took the order from him and got it cashed at a tradesman's, but I cannot now say what one it was. About a week after that he brought home another order. I took that and got it cashed in the same way, but I cannot give the name and address of the person I cashed it with. In cases where I got goods I handed them to Seymour, and he went and sold them. I also gave him the cash I got in exchange for the orders. I should think that altogether I have gut rid of about six orders, all of which I have got from Seymour. A man lodging at a common lodging-house in Tufton Street has, I believe, got the orders at the post-offices. He has called at the house we were living at in Lambeth on several occasions and asked for Seymour, and the latter has asked him to come into the room. I have usually gone out with the child on those occasions, so did not hear what was said. The man in question is named Evans; he is about 40; he is tall, tuft on chin, and moustache turning grey. I saw him yester<lb/>day, he was out with Seymour; they went about 1 p.m., and Seymour came back alone. I first saw Evans when I was out with Seymour one day in Westminster. I have always known Seymour by that name. The order produced was brought into the house by Seymour about mid<lb/>day to-day (Friday). We had a row because I would not fetch some more beer for him, and he knocked me about after dinner. About 4 p.m. he told me to get the child ready as he wanted me to go out with him. I did so, and we all went out together. Shortly afterwards we came to Islington, and when we got to the Angel he handed me the order and the letter, and pointed out the shop of Mr. Smith and told me to go in and get it cashed. I did so, and Seymour waited outside, as he has always done when I have gone to cash the orders. We met the prisoner Knapton in a street before we got to the Angel; he did not appear to be waiting. He walked on in front with Seymour, and I could not hear what was said, but Knapton could hear what Seymour said when he handed me the order. Knapton has been with Seymour on about two previous occasions when he has handed me the orders.") I read this over to her and then said "You didn't tell me that Knapton was at your house to-day"—she said "No, you didn't ask me; he was there, and he and Seymour went out together."</p>

               <p>there saw Evans, and said to him, "I am a detective attached to the General Post-office, and I am instructed to see you in regard to a number of post-office orders which have been taken out for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each and altered to larger amounts, and negotiated by two men, Knapton and Seymour, and a woman named Haines"—he said, "Yes, I know them, and have taken out a number of money orders for 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each for them, from instructions that I have received from Seymour, Knapton being generally present; I have always given the orders to Seymour, I have never had any of the proceeds more than a glass of ale which I have been treated to for getting them; I know nothing of what they did with them"—I then produced two money order requisition forms which I had obtained from the post-office in London Road, Southwark, one of which relates to the money order which, was changed at Mr. Smith's, the other relates to another order—he said, "They are in my handwriting "—I then showed him the forged order, and he said that the money orders which he had taken out for the requisition forms he had handed to Seymour—I then told him that I should take him in custody and charge him with being concerned with the other three in forging and uttering post-office orders—he said, "I am innocent."</p>

I have just seen the woman Haines and she says that she received this order and letter from you, and that the letter is in your handwriting; the letter is similar to several I have at the Post-office in the same handwriting"—the prisoner replied "I admit that is in my handwriting"—that was the one handed to Mr. Saunderson—I said "If you wrote this one you wrote them all"—he replied "You are assuming that"—I said "There can be no mistake, they are all in the same handwriting "—I have compared the letter admitted to be in his handwriting with the letter produced to Mr. Bullen's assistant, and there is no doubt whatever that they are in the same handwriting—I have also seen the writing on these pay sheets, and also these requisition forms upon which the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. post-office orders were issued—they are in the same handwriting, but it is not Seymour's, it is Evans' writing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the Confidential Inquiry branch of the General Post-office—in consequence of numerous letters being lost at the Putney office I was instructed to investigate the matter—I made up a test letter addressed to Mrs. Bass, 18, Sefton Street, Putney, an empty house—if a letter carrier cannot deliver a letter, it is his duty to return it to the overseer—I put into the letter throe postal orders for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—this is the letter—I posted it at noon on 9th December—the address was within the prisoner's district—the letter would come into his delivery at 1.40 that day—finding that the letter did not come back to the office, on the 11th I saw the prisoner at Putney in the presence of Constable Beck—I said to him "I posted a letter on the 9th December at 12 o'clock at noon, addressed to Mrs. Bass, 18, Sefton Street, Putney; it is an empty house, and it was your duty to return that letter to the overseer on your return to the office; what did you do with it?"—he said "I remember the letter; I believe I handed it to the overseer with the other undeliverable letters on my return to the office with the 5.55 collection"—I said "Mr. Dodson did not receive it"—he said "Then I must have left it in my bag"—he would carry a bag on his delivery in the ordinary course—I said "Are you sure you did not put it in your pocket?"—he said "No; I never put letters in my pocket"—the constable afterwards brought me this letter; it was unopened—he said he had found it in the pocket of the prisoner's coat or tunic at his lodging—I cannot say whether the tunics have inside or outside pockets—this other letter was produced at the same time; it is addressed to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Wandsworth and Putney Observer</hi>—that letter was open, and the cover was partially torn; at the same time a portion of a cover was handed to me, bearing two stamps, not obliterated—I asked the pri<lb/>soner how he accounted for the possession of that letter—he said "A little boy handed me the letter, and said he had picked it up in the street; the letter was then open"—I said "Why did not you deliver it or hand it to the overseer?"—he said "Because I was afraid I should get into trouble on account of the letter being open"—the stamps on the letter were dated the 25th November—I asked him if he knew the boy that gave him the letter—he said "No"—when he was spoken to about Mrs. Bass's letter having been found in his pocket, I asked him if he had any other explanation to offer—he said "I must have left it there accidentally"—I gave him into custody—I afterwards opened the, letter; the contents were intact—I believe I did not tell him who I was—I am told I did not, but I was under the impression I had done so.</p>

I am barmaid at the Pelican Hotel, All Saints Road, North Kensington, kept by my brother, Frederick Thomas—on 23rd December, about 4.30, I was in the bar by myself and the prisoner came in with Newman—Leach said "Have you got a half-sovereign for nine shillings, sixpence, and sixpennyworth of coppers?"—I gave him one, and he gave me the nine shillings and sixpence and sixpence in pence, which I put into the till—he then said "Will you give me a half-crown for a two shilling piece and sixpennyworth of coppers, which he gave me, and I gave him a half-crown—I put the florin where I took the half-crown from, putting a sixpence on the top to make the half-crown right—the money I gave him was good—Leach then called for a glass of port, three cigars, and a glass of bitter, which came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half-crown—the port was for Newman and the bitter for Leach—about ten minutes afterwards Leach called for the same drink as before, and cigars, and paid again with a half-crown and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—Leach then called for a glass of port, and asked me if I should like a glass of port—I said "I don't care for it"—he asked me again, and I had it—he asked the potman to have a glass of beer, which he did, and Leach paid with a half-crown—some change was given to him, but I cannot say what—I put the three half-crowns together on the top of the till—Leach then left, and Newman remained and called for a glass of port, and threw down a half-crown—I tried it between my teeth and in the detector, found it bad, and returned it to him, and he paid with a good sixpence, and left—I then looked at the three half-crowns on the till, found they were bad, and spoke to the pot<lb/>man, who went out—I gave the coins to my brother; these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. I gave a description to the police of the man who was with Newman—I said that he was thin and delicate-looking, rather dark, with a high hat and a black coat, trimmed with blach astrachan—I was not half a second before I identified you—I had not got in at the door—my suspicions were not aroused because I did not believe Newman, our customer, would bring a fellow in to pase bad coin—Newman's presence disarmed me; I had never seen you before—I was serving customers, and going to the till frequently, but I took no half-crowns except from you two—you were there about an hour—I was serving only a couple of yards from the till—the drink came to 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. at a time—you did not change the half-crown I gave you; you put it in your pocket.</p>

Mile End—on the afternoon of 30th December I was in the Railway Tavern drinking with a friend, Dan Clark—I saw the prisoners there—I had two penny worth of rum and paid for a pot of ale—I went from there to the Crown, Commercial Road, on my way home—the prisoners followed just behind me down the road—I and Clark went in, and I called for a pot of ale; the prisoners came and we talked together—I knew them before by going down to the docks—I saw they became rather quarrelsome—I attempted to go out, but McCarthy got in front of the door and said "You don't get away from me so easy as you think"—I said "You would not take this liberty with me only you know I am suffering from bronchitis and consumption "—I made a second attempt—my friend said" Why don't you let him out? he is doing nothing to you "—I made the third attempt and got out—I saw them coming after me, I went into the private compartment; they followed me, I was frightened and jumped over the bar and said to the barman "I wish you would call for a constable "—the barman helped me over—when the constable came to the door I went out—I said "I wish you would protect me against these men"—a man not in custody said "He struck my sister "—'the barman and constable would not hear what I had to say; I could not speak very well owing to my complaint—he went along as far as York Road and left</p>

               <p>me—I went down York Square, and in the middle of it the prisoners came running up, and two of them pinned me behind—Fox had this arm, and Murphy, not in custody, must have had the other—McCarthy seized me by the throat, put his hand into my pocket, and took out 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and the others got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and a handkerchief out of my pocket—they got away as far as the turning, where I saw them count the money—McCarthy said "What have you got?"—Murphy said "1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—McCarthy said "I have got nothing"—I got up and said "You have got 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of mine"—I went to see if I could see a policeman, and they made off—Clark seemed to go that way with them—I went to the Thames Police-court—I had had a good deal of drink, but I was as clear as I am at the present—I am not a great drinker, I drink moderately.</p>

I lodge at Mrs. Hill's house—on 9th December, about 2.30 in the day, I was undressed and in bed—my wife brought me a shilling; I bit it, found it gritty, and my teeth sank into it—I dressed myself as quickly as possible, and overtook the prisoner in Avenue Road, 30 or 40 yards from the house, going towards Acton in the opposite direction to Turnham Green—I took him back to the house—my wife gave me the coin—I put it in my mouth in the prisoner's presence, doubled it up, and throw it towards her for her to pick up, and the instant it touched the table the prisoner picked it up and swallowed it—I caught him by his throat, and endeavoured to prevent him, but he said "Don't choke me," and I left off pressing his throat—I found on him a good florin, a penny, and a number of ballads—I took him to the station—he was charged, and made no reply—when asked his address he said "No fixed abode."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a draper's assistant, of High Street, North Finchley—on 30th November, about 3 or 3.15 p.m., the prisoners came in and bought two silk handkerchiefs and two pairs of gloves, which came to 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—while I was looking out the gloves, Mary Ann said "Can you give me change for this sovereign," and laid this Hanover medal on the counter this side up.—(<hi rend="italic">The side with "To Hanover" on it</hi>.) I took it up and said "This is worthless, not worth a copper"—she said "Is it bad then?"—I repeated that it was not worth a copper—she seemed surprised, and I said "Where did you get it from?"—she said "My master paid me this morning"—I advised her to take it back to her master at once, as he must have made a mistake—she said she would do so, and gave me a good sovereign to pay for the goods—I gave her a half-sovereign and a shilling in change—she put the medal back in the paper with what looked like some sovereigns—she had taken the medal out of that paper—I saw them later on looking in at the window, and saw them pass the shop twice that evening, and saw a policeman take them.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> She took the medal from a paper in which there were several other coins, and handed it to me with the man on horseback upwards—she seemed to be taken quite <hi rend="italic">aback</hi> when I said that it was valueless, and she at once said "I received this to-day from my master," and took from the same paper a good sovereign—I gave the medal back to her, she wrapped it up in the, paper, put it in her pocket, and went away—the Queen's head was on one side—they did not tell me who their master was, but I afterwards heard that it was Mr. Sewell, of Winchmore Hill, which is four miles off—I can get there from my shop by train to Finsbury Park.</p>

My husband is a fishmonger, of Lodge Lane, North Finchley—on 30th November, about 5.30, Field brought me a Hanoverian medal like this; I found it was not a sovereign—the prisoners then asked for twopennyworth of sweets, and I served them—we have two separate shops—holding the medal in my hand, I then said to the elder prisoner," This is useless "—she then gave me another Hano<lb/>verian medal, which she took out of a piece of paper in her hand, and put the first one back in the paper—she said, "Is this good?"—I said "No"—she then gave me a good sovereign from the same paper—I gave it back to her, and asked her if she had any more money—she said "Yes," and gave me a shilling, and I gave her the change—I said, "Where did you get the bad money from?"—she said, "My master paid me my wages this morning "—I said that she had better take them back to her master, and asked her if she was aware that she was liable to five years for uttering them—she said she would take them back to her master, and would give him five years for giving her such coin—they left; I told a constable, and he took them.</p>

               <p>about 8 o'clock, when the workmen had left, I went up to the top floor front, and about 8.15 I saw Whistler outside—he struck two fusees, and I went into the back room, got out on the parapet, and went along up to the next house, and got in at the back window into a room, and down a flight of steps into a bedroom, where I saw a lot of jewellery in cases on the dressing-table and in the drawers—there was no light in the room, but I lit a safety match and a candle—I took everything I saw in the way of a jewel-case, and put them in my pocket—I had a <hi rend="italic">bobtail</hi> coat on—I took two jewel-boxes upstairs to a room at the top—I was told to lock the door and break the boxes open and the cases, which I did, and left them on the floor, and put the jewels in my pocket—there were diamonds, rubies, and pearls—I got back the way I came, and down to the first floor of No. 4—I then looked and saw one of the workmen downstairs, so I did not go down, but went into the drawing-room and out at the window, and got into the street by a lamp railing—I went to Stanhope Gate and saw Whistler—I took my hat off, as bad been arranged between us, to let him know that I had got the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>—I told him we were being watched—he told me to go to St. George's Hospital and wait there till he, came—I went there and saw Russell there—I had seen him before, coming out of 92, Robert Street with Whistler, but I had not spoken to him—Whistler had told me that Russell was his step-father—I waited there nearly three-quarters of an hour, and Whistler came and spoke to Russell, who went into a public-house, and Whistler came over to me and said he had told his father I had the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>, and he was crying with joy—he left me and returned, and he and I got into a cab and drove to Wardour Street—I gave him part of the jewellery on the way—he looked at them and said "They are real diamonds," and put them in his pocket—we got out of the cab and walked to Shaftesbury Avenue—I then gave him all the jewellery except a box with these three diamonds—he said he was going to take it to the old man, who would run it down and take the stones out—he gave me 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and told me to meet him at Castle's coffee-shop, Hampstead Road—I went there, and he joined me in about three-quarters of an hour, and said he had taken the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi> to the old man, and I was to meet him next morning at the same place—Whistler had not stayed at our house up to that date; when his father came out of prison he went to 92, Robert Street, and he said that I was to kick up a <hi rend="italic">row</hi>, so as to get turned out of my mother's house, and he would take me with him to Dartford—I managed to have so serious a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> with my mother that I was able to leave the house, and I went to a common lodging-house in St. Martin's Lane and slept there, and Whistler supported me—he gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. one night and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. another night—while I was there he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to go and buy some charcoal, which I did, at a greengrocer's in Hedley Street, Hampstead Road—Mr. Stephens sold it to me—Whistler said that the charcoal was to be used for the old man to "run the gold down" and sell it and the stones—I took it to 92, Robert Street, and gave it to Mrs. Maddison, and Whistler told her to give me an overcoat, which she did—that was about a week after I went to Dartford with Whistler—we went down there about the middle of May, because, he said, we should not be picked up by the detectives—we lived at the British Workman there three weeks—he passed as a dealer in old clothes there, and I was to be his workman——about that time I found a watch chain in an overcoat of his; I showed</p>

               <p>it to him and he said that he forgot to give it to the old man, and that it came from Audley Square—we afterwards removed to Mrs. Page's, at Dartford, and were there about nine weeks—we were at Dartford altogether about three months, and Whistler paid for my board and lodging—during that time he made the acquaintance of Ellen Stephens, who he married—he used to have remittances every week, sometimes on Friday and sometimes on Monday, postal orders for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he said came from the old man—I saw the old man at Dartford two or three times—he came twice before the marriage and once afterwards—he said to me in Whistler's presence "You did that job very well in Audley Square, I think you got it all"—Whistler said "I don't think he did"—Russell said "Yes, he got it all"—Russell remained to dinner at the Pages' once, and they saw him, and the girl Stephens saw him also—while I lived at Dartford, Whistler and I went up to Queensborough Terrace, and Upper Brook Street, and Ledbury Gardens—after leaving Dartford I went to live with Whistler at the old lodging in St. Martin's Lane—the girl Stephens took it, and passed as Mrs. Whistler, and after a week Whistler went to live at 42, Hethpool Street, and I remained at St. Martin's Lane—after that Whistler introduced me to Evans, in Edgware Road; he told Evans that I had done a good job in Audley Square—he called me Arty—he said that he had got his old man to look over some houses, and Evans was to come to Finsbury Terrace with me—as we three walked along we saw this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—Whistler went up and read it and came away and said "That is the job we done"—in October Evans and I broke into a house in Lancaster Gate, and Whistler stood outside and gave the signal—Evans and I robbed the house, and while we were inside an alarm was given, and we tried to escape—I had to drop from a wall into a mews, and sprained my ankle, and could not get away, and was caught—Evans was also caught—we were tried at Middlesex Sessions, I pleaded guilty and Evans was found guilty and Sentenced to seven years' penal servitude, but on the intercession of a gentleman who came forward I was allowed out on my own recognisances, and immediately went into the gentleman's employment—the police came to me and I told the whole story.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector E</hi>). On 5th November, Henry Gosling came to Vine Street Police-station and gave me some information—I then went with Sergeant Tanning to Leicester Square and saw Whistler and another prisoner who is not now on his trial—on 5th November I had Whistler taken in custody on another charge outside a house in Queensbury Place, South Kensington—I saw him searched; some vesuvians were found on him and other articles—on 25th November I took Russell at 20, Bolsover Street, Marylebone, in a bedroom on the first floor—I told him we were police officers, and he would be charged with a man named Whistler in committing a robbery at 3, Audley Square last May—he said "I know nothing about it; you have made a mistake this time"—I took him in custody, searched the room, and found 50 small diamonds wrapped in paper, and four other stones, I am not sure whether they are diamonds or not; a diamond ring, three pieces of broken jewellery, a part of which had a small diamond still in it—there was a piece of gold in a table drawer—I also found a 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold—the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes are perforated "J. M. and Co."—I also found these large tongs, a pair of pinchers, two bradawls, an iron spoon, burnt at the bottom, some borax, and two tin blowers, which will cover the whole of the fireplace and create a draft—they fit very close—also a pair of blue spectacles, and this bill spoken to by Osborne—when I found the borax I said to Russell</p>

I am a porter—on 4th November I saw Whistler at the top of Swallow Place, Piccadilly—he spoke to me, and we had a long conversation—I met him again at 11 o'clock the same night at the Cambrian public-house, Beak Street—we went to another public-house, and I asked him who a man was who is not in the dock now—he said, "A poor man out of employment, and I am going to see what I can make of him, as I have lost my little boy, who did the job so well for me at 3, Audley Square"—I asked him what he got from there—he said "A good bunch," or "A good bundle"—I said, "How is it you are so hard up then, if you got that lot of <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>?"—he said that his captain did not part with one hundredth part of what he ought to have had—I asked him why he wanted to part with the little boy—he said that he had done a job for him so well at Lancaster Gate, after dropping a wall 14 feet high—I said, "Was you in that?"—he said, "Yes, but went away after seeing my little boy <hi rend="italic">Arty, pinched</hi>," that is "caught"—I asked him how the boy got on—he said that a man named Evans was doing seven years for the Lancaster Gate job, and a gentleman had interceded on the boy's behalf, and he had to come up for judgment when called upon—as we left the public-house that night we saw a bill like this produced, and Whistler pointed to it and said, "That is the bill that is out for me and the boy"—I put myself in communication with the police on Friday afternoon—I acted under their instructions.</p>

I am a cab driver, and live at 20, St. James's Mows, near Primrose Hill—it is immediately opposite No. 3, which has been occupied by the prisoner about three years—I have been in those premises on several occasions—there was a three-stall stable and coach-house, and dwelling-rooms above—the prisoner lived there with his wife and two daughters, one about 14 and the other about 11—I recollect a fire occurring on Wednesday, 22nd September—I got home with my cab about half-past 4 that morning—there was no cab standing in the yard outside the prisoner's stable at that time—his cab usually stood in the left-hand corner of the mews—as I drove into the mews I noticed a good light in his stable—as I drove up to my door the light was lowered; it was an oil lamp—I put my horse and cab away, and went upstairs to bed—my wife was partially dressed—she made a statement to me—as I was undressing and about to get into bed, I heard a peculiar sound—I went to my left door, and discovered Fuller's place in flames—I called out "Fire" at the top of my voice as loud as I could hallo a two or three times—there was no cry of fire before that—I slipped on my trousers and boots and rushed down and burst open his stable-door, and I broke open the coach-house door as wel—I then saw the cab and cart inside—the prisoner's dog rushed out with a Piece of rope attached to his collar and nearly threw me down—there was a fire over the first horse in the first stall and a fire in a large tub behind the horse in the third stall at the far end of the stable—the fire in the first stall was in straw packed up on some rafters close to the ceiling, that was all ablaze, and there was a blue fluid fire dropping from the; some fell on the horse and some on the floor, and where it continued to burn for some seconds—when the straw had exhausted itself and fell in burning masses under the horse, there was a hole in the ceiling, where the flooring-boards had been removed; that hole was not caused by the fire—there was ample space in the ceiling to take up a truss of hay—any one in the room above could have passed anything thorough—some few minutes after the fire I saw a quart beer can fall through the hole, and in its descent it struck the first horse on the quarter, and rebounded close to my feet, where it fell, and it was involved in a bluish fluid, which con<lb/>tinued</p>

               <p>to burn till it was exhausted—the second fire was in the corner of the third stall, in a large tub, that was a reddish flame—there was no communication between the two fires—the partition between the stable and coach-house was not burnt through, only in one or two little places, not sufficient for the fires to communicate—the horses were tied up very securely—I tried to release the first horse, but I could not get near its head, it was plunging about so—it was tied up so that it could lie down if it liked—a man named Avant came first to my assistance—I tried to get water to extinguish the fire—I have a large tub outside my premises, and I used as much as I could get out of that—I then went to Fuller's tap, just inside the coach-house door—I found the tap turned on and the water run off—I pulled out the cab, and my next-door neighbour and some one else assisted me to pull the cart out—after a time the fire<lb/>engines arrived—I did not see any fire in the coach-house—I saw Helmer go in with a pail of water immediately after the cart was pulled out—I saw the prisoner on the roof about five or six minutes after I discovered the fire—he was dressed with the exception of his hat and coat—I could not say whether he had his boots on; he had on his collar and tie, and I noticed he had his watch and chain on—there was a trap<lb/>door communicating with the roof about 11 feet from the ground—there would be no difficulty in dropping from there—the stable window was broken, and I believe two panes were out of the fanlight over the stable door, and they were blocked up with straw; also the vent holes in the coach-house door; that was done on the Monday previous to the five—after the fire was extinguished I went into the stable—it was 10 or 14 minutes before the fire was put out; it was all burnt through to the roof in 10 or 12 minutes—when I got into the stable, the stable lamp was knocked down as the flooring fell, and it lay there and continued to burn in the same way as the beer can, and it burnt till the lamp was partially unsoldered—there were upwards of a dozen beer cans lying about the floor, and there was one hanging up on a large nail in the coach-house—I examined it; it contained some paraffin oil and a bit of rag or something of that sort in it—that was a quart beer can, with a swing handle across the top—the horses were lying on the ground dead when I went in after the fire—the cart usually stood in the mews—I don't remember the prisoner having any horse on Barnet Fair day—three weeks previous to this fire he had sold one at Barnet Fair—I could not recog<lb/>nise the horse in the first stall, but I knew the horse in the middle stall, it was what we called a hollow-backed mare—I should say the prisoner had had that about a fortnight or something; like that—I had seen him drive it frequently in the cart—the outside value of it was about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the horse in the third stall was an old worn-out blind horse—I had only seen that in the cart once, about two or three days before the fire, the value of that was about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—shortly before the fire I had also seen a very heavy horse, almost a cart-horse, in the pri<lb/>soner's possession; that was not the horse in the first stall, it was a much heavier horse than that—the value of the horse in the first stall seemed to me to be about the same as the blind horse, 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I should say the heavy horse was worth a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note—I heard the prisoner asked on that morning by, I believe, the foreman of the Salvage Corps if he was insured, and he said he didn't know whether his wife had paid the last premium—during the morning, after the fire was extinguished, I saw</p>

               <p>the prisoner in a public-house; a man named Frank Haley, myself, and his father were with him—I don't remember any conversation that morning; there was the day after, on the Thursday; the prisoner's father was not there then—Haley said to me "My brother asked me how you are going on, and I told him you were working hard with one horse, and his brother said 'Does he want a horse? if he do he can have one money or no money'"—the prisoner said "Yes, you can have a horse, mate; I will fill up your stable for you if you like, if you keep quiet"—from something I heard on 7th October I went to the Insurance office, and had an interview with Mr. Jobson, the secretary, and after that I was summoned by the prisoner to the Marylebone Police-court for using threats and attempting to extort money—Mr. Jobson was called on my behalf, and the summonses were dismissed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When I was inside the premises and saw these different fires I believed the premises had been wilfully set on fire; what my wife said raised that belief in my mind—next morning. I was drinking with the prisoner some considerable time at the Pitt's Head—I don't know whether the prisoner and his family took new lodgings on that day; I wept to their new lodgings, on the Thursday I think it was—he was not at home then, and I went on another occasion and found him at home and remained some time in his company and had a friendly conversation together—he did not tell me that his <hi rend="italic">missus</hi> was very much cut up about the fire, and I did not suggest taking her for a ride; I gave them a lift from the corner to the Lord's Cricket Ground—we were going to have a glass together and the prisoner proposed to go to Lord's, and we went there and I drove them back to the Red House again—after that I had the use of the prisoner's cab for six days, and then his wife came up and said I was not to use it any more—there were several police in the mews on the morning of the fire, and also an inspector, whom I knew; and I also knew several of the policemen by sight, but not their names—I did not whisper to either of them that my belief was the place had been set on fire—the Insurance office was not the first place I went to on 1st October—I went first to inquire where the prisoner was insured; I did not go to the police-station—I never said to the prisoner in the presence of Haley "I think I ought to have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when this is finished, and if I don't I will have it on the other side "—that is nothing more than a villainous inven<lb/>tion on the part of the prisoner and Haley—I did not see the Insurance agent at the premises the day after the fire, or the second day; I never saw any one connected with the Insurance people—the prisoner complained that the 2nd and 9th of October were the dates on which I had threatened him—I attended before the Magistrate on Wednesday, the 20th, I believe, and I had received the summons on the Friday before—I had been sum<lb/>moned before that by the prisoner, in January of the past year; that was not for an assault, it was a little bother, but we were both dismissed—I was not bound over—I saw a good light in the prisoner's stable when I drove into the mews on this night, and when I got to my own door the light was lowered—there is only one window in the stable and that opens into the mews, but there is a fanlight over the door—the place was not particularly full of smoke when I burst open the door; there was smoke hanging about the ceiling, and after a few minutes it was filled with smoke—the horses were plunging about, and I could not get near them—I saw the prisoner on the top of the roof of his own house—he was not</p>

               <p>calling out when I first saw him; a minute or two afterwards he was—he was then leaning up against a stack of chimneys, and I told him to get on two or three stables up—I did not go on the roof—I saw a ladder taken there but he did not come down at once—he was feigning distress—I did not see someone take him some hot rum and water on to the roof—it was taken some few minutes before he was brought down; I did not see him brought down—at the public-house the next day the prisoner said "If it had not been for the dog I should not have been here now "—he told me that the dog scratched him on his breast and woke him up—the premises were in pretty fair repair, about the same as the other houses; they are old stables—every hole in the window on Monday was stuffed up with straw, and also the holes—I have only seen straw in the bottom part of the stable window before—I have never seen him do it in the winter—if it had been there any considerable time I should have seen it—the cart horse was a black horse; I do not know that it kicked down the partition—I believe it was the prisoner's practice to get in the straw on Saturday—so far as I could see there was the usual quantity of straw on this Wednesday as he had on other Wednesdays—I know he had a horse afflicted with a malady called "The Duke," and I know that a compound of paraffin is used for that complaint—I don't know that he used to make that compound and sell it to others—he painted his own vehicles, but he did not keep the paints and varnishes in the loft to my knowledge—the upper part of the premises over the coachhouse is the living room, and there is a bedroom over the back part of the stable; the front room is what we call the loft—he never had any store of paints and varnishes; he bought it in small quantities—when he has been painting I have seen it in ordinary jampots—it is a ceiling through which the hole came—I had not seen the hole there before the night of the fire—I do not know that there was a forge on the premises before the prisoner came there, and that a hole was cut in the ceiling lined with tin acting as a vent-hole for that forge—I first gave evidence at the police-court on 5th November; that was the first occasion upon which the prisoner was brought to answer any charge of this sort—he used to be constantly buying horses—he used to do a bit of <hi rend="italic">coping</hi>; that is how he got animals to pull his cab about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. The room above where the hole was was, I believe, used for kitchen purposes, for washing and all that sort of thing—I went to the insurance office to justify myself in consequence of the slander that the prisoner and his wife had circulated about the neighbourhood about me—the prisoner had been, I believe, to the Insurance people to have his claim settled, and when he found his claim was repudiated he thought himself justified in slandering me and my wife, telling people that we had been to the office and told them that he had set fire to the premises and prevented him from getting his money, and that I was to have six months—I had not been to the office before he slandered me.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness—I recollect the time Barnet Fair took place—on a Monday night about that time there was a fire at the prisoner's coach-house; it was about 11, as near as I can tell—I cannot say where the cart was then, but the cab was in the coach-house; it sometimes stood in there, and sometimes in the mews—I was aroused on that night by Mrs. Fuller calling "Mrs. Hohler" from a window of one of the upper rooms—I went down as quickly as possible, and a Mrs. Smallman and I pushed the stable door open—we found the place full of smoke, and got some water and put the fire out, and then found a heap of sacks and rubbish under the stairs smouldering; there was no flame—we dragged them into the mews, and got some water from a tub at our door, and put it out—there was a tap in the prisoner's coach-house; we tried that, but we could get no water—Mrs. Fuller and her younger daughter Laura were the only persons in the house at that time that I saw—I recollect the second fire on the 22nd September—on the Friday previous to that I saw Mrs. Fuller and her child carrying bundles away, and a washing-bath was carried away also—it seemed like ornaments and different articles in that way, and on Saturday morning a blackbird in a cage was taken away—on Monday night about 10 a loaded cart went away with goods, with some straw on the top—I saw the prisoner on that night, and he asked me had I seen a lady and gentleman at his stable—he said that he had taken a load of straw to a friend who had some horses unexpectedly—I said "Yes, and moving too"—he asked me what I meant—I told him when he was going to do anything not to let children know—the child had said they were to have gone on the Friday night or Saturday morning—he then threatened the child very severely, and said he would punish her, but I didn't catch the words he used—this conversation was about half-past 10 on Monday night—I afterwards met the child on that night, and she was crying bitterly—during Monday I saw the prisoner on his premises putting up a sort of boarding along in the first stall, and filling it with straw, and he also filled the windows, and also the fanlight across the stable door, and the two holes in the stable, with fresh straw—on Tuesday night about 11 I saw the cart go away again, and Mrs. Fuller was sitting on the back, but I could not see who was driving—the prisoner at that time was down in the mews, and closed the coach-house doors after them—the cart was loaded with what had the appearance of being goods—my husband was out with his cab during the night—I saw the prisoner again about 1.30 a.m. on Wednesday morning looking out of the upstairs window, and I saw him crawling about on his hands and knees in the room directly over the stables, pulling up the boards, and I also heard a great rustling of straw, as if he was pulling straw from somewhere—I saw him right up to 3 o'clock at different intervals—the cab had stood in the mews from the time of the first fire, and I saw the cab there on this morning at half-past 2—I again saw the prisoner about 4 or a little after, and I saw him barely 10 minutes before the fire—I sat up all night, because I felt a dreadful dread—I knew there was something wrong, but I thought they were moving, nothing more, and I thought I would see the last of them—at that time I didn't know the day of the month, but I knew it afterwards—about 10 minutes before the fire I saw</p>

               <p>the prisoner looking very suspiciously out of the side of the window, with a candle or a light of some description in his hand—I was dressed, with the exception of my dress—when my husband came home I made a statement to him, and in the space of a few minutes we heard a noise of some description, and I said "Hark! he is moving now"—I got up then, and saw the place on fire opposite, and my husband called "Fire! fire!" as loud as he could—up to that time I had heard no cry of fire—my husband directly slipped on some things, and ran down as quickly as possible, and burst open the stable door—I went to the stable door, and saw there was a fire in the back of the stable, evidently in a large tub, and also in the front part over the door—about 10 o'clock in the morning I saw the prisoner, and asked him what message he had sent to me previously, and told him that I had seen him crawling on his hands and knees, and that I had seen him all night, and I told him that he had stated to the inspector that he was in bed, and the dog woke him, and I said "That was not true"—he made no remark, but staggered inside the stable—on the night of the first fire the handrail of the balusters was all right; I did not notice it on the night of the second fire—it would be impossible to get furniture down the stairs with the handrail there; it is got in through the loft door—I did not see any heavy furniture being taken out of the loft—I did not see the prisoner come from the roof; I saw him on there, and he looked then as if he was dressed as I had seen him at the window, but I could not be positive.</p>

                  </hi>. I am labourer—on the night of 21st September I was at work at 18, St. James's Mews, at Mr. Hibbert's, and slept there that night—about half-past 4 a.m. I was awoke by something unusual—I opened the coachhouse door and saw smoke coming out of No. 3, and saw Mr. Hohler in the mews trying to extinguish the fire; I ran towards him—the stable and coachhouse doors were open—on going into the stable I saw fire above the roof, rather over the rear of the second horse, and there appeared to be lying between the first and second horse a bluish kind of fluid, more like out of a mortuary; it was all ablaze; it came through a hole rather larger round than my hat—that hole was not made by the fire, it was more like as if it was broken away—there had been another fire in the stable behind the cart; I saw that when they pulled the cart away; Mr. Hohler had just put it out—the cab had been pulled out—I did not see any fire in the coachhouse—I saw a man go in behind the cart with a bucket of water—I saw the horses in the stable; I tried to rescue them, but could not unfasten them; their heads were reared up, and fire was dropping on them—I was barefooted, and one of the horses trod on me—the ropes were tried in a very clumsy manner, not in a proper way to fasten horses up—I tried to get some water, first at Mr. Hohler's and then at the prisoner's tap, but that was turned on and there was no water—I saw two coats and a hat thrown out of the loft door, I could not say who threw them, I was stooping down at the time to throw some water, and they came on my back—I got a ladder and went up to the loft door, but could not get in—I brought down a bird in a cage—the loft door was open at the left—I gave the coats and hat to a cabman's wife next, and they took them to No. 7—the prisoner afterwards asked for them; he said, "I managed to throw my coats out"—I said, "What a singular thing you could not through the skylight—he had on his socks, trousers, waistcoat, shirt, collar and tie, and chain, no boots, they were in the gutter about two yards behind him.</p>

I said "it is a serious thing for you"—I did not say "let me go there with you, you leave me to talk to the insurance people; you are not used to this, they will do you out of it"—I did not on another occasion say "Hohler is going to kick up a row with you now that you have taken the cab away from him"—I did not say "He is going to the Insurance Company about you, I should make a good witness for you, and of course I must be one the side where the money is, you bet; it may be a good job for me, a good coat on my back, or a piece of gold"—I am not working for anybody now, I am kept out of employment through this case—I have been keeping myself as best I could, working at the snow—the Insurance Company is not keeping me, no one is keeping me, only myself, by casual labour.</p>

From about a fortnight before 22nd September I was on duty at night down St. James's Mews; that is my beat—my hours are from two to six o'clock in the morning—I know the prisoner's stable, and also his Hansom cab—for a fortnight previous to the fire I had always seen that, cab standing in the mews—on the morning of the fire I went through the mews at about 2.30; his cab was then standing in the corner of the mews in its usual place, about 20 or 25 yards from his stable—I went through the mews again at 3.30, and the cab was gone.</p>

               <p>them; that is because I know the drivers—I know the prisoner—tramps have been known to go down that mews and get into the cabs to sleep, but I have not seen them—it is my duty to see that the cabs are not occupied by tramps—the park is not far from these mews, and when tramps are turned out of the park they come into these mews, but I have not known a cabman find it out and get up and bring his cab in.</p>

               <p>paraffin—it was hanging on a nail—a piece of rag was inside it—I found 11 other beer-cans on the premises; I produce two—the others were similar cans to these produced—they were burnt so that I could not see what had been in them—this is the one (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) which was hanging up in the coach-house, consequently not so much burnt—this other one was found amongst the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi>—they were all burnt—I saw a wooden tub at the end of the stable—the inside was all burnt and charred very much, and some straw at the bottom had been on fire, but the fire had been extinguished—the inside of the tub was burnt and round the rim, but outside the woodwork was not burnt at all—where it was exposed to the fire it was scorched a little, but not very much—the floor between the stable and the loft, or what has been here called the loft, I believe was entirely burnt away; it was all gone completely—the floor over the stable was also burned, but the ceiling had not fallen through—the ceiling over the coach-house would be under the floor of the dwelling-room; that had not fallen through—the dwelling-room had been burnt out—there was a mark in the narrow staircase leading from the coach-house where a handrail had been—at the top part the nails were still there which had nailed the handrail to the upright, and the upright at the bottom of the stairs had been sawn off—about three feet of the upright was standing—it was more convenient to get down with<lb/>out the rail—I made inquiries into the matter, and on the 5th November the prisoner was brought to the station—I told him I should apprehend him for wilfully and maliciously setting fire to the dwelling-room of 3, St. James's Mews occupied by him on the 22nd September—he replied "All right; who said I set fire to them?"—I said "You will hear the evidence before the Magistrate, but you can hear the witness's state<lb/>ments now if you wish"—he said "No, I will wait"—I searched him, and found a letter from the Insurance Office refusing to pay the claim.</p>

I am a member of the London Salvage Corps—on the morning of the fire I arrived at the premises about half-past 5—the fire was pretty well over—I was told to go there and ascertain if the premises were insured—the prisoner said he had refused to pay the insurance or to allow his wife to pay it, and he was under the impression that the premises were uninsured, and as his wife was not there I was left behind till his wife arrived home, to ascertain the truth—the prisoner appeared very much cut up—I went over the premises—I have had two years' experience in connection with fires—on coming upstairs the place had the usual appearance with regard to furniture—there was a chest of drawers there, and some pots and pans and things, the usual articles which one would expect to find in a living room—I did not look round for a table—evidently the room had not been swept clean out before the fire, nor was there anything to suggest that suspicion to my mind, but</p>

               <p>said "A poor man out of work," and he was going to see what he could make of him, as he had lost his little boy <hi rend="italic">Arty</hi>—I asked him where Hopper came from, he said from St. Martin's Lane, from the place where he was lodging—he said he was very sorry he had lost his little boy, who had done the job so well in Audley Square, and he dropped a 14 feet wall and got pinched for it, and that the captain did not part up with a hundredth part of what he had—we went into a by-street where he showed me this reward bill about Audley Square—I said "Now suppose the boy rounds on you?" he said "The boy cannot round, because all the stones are <hi rend="italic">unsetted</hi> and the gold is melted down"—he asked me to meet him next morning, Friday, which I did, and I left him at 20 minutes to 1, and got to Yine Street about 12 minutes to 1, and saw Conquest, and told him what Whistler had told me, and acted under his directions from that time—I met Whistler in Leicester Square at 12 o'clock on the Friday; he was just inside, reading a board, and Hopper was on the left-hand side—Hopper said "You have come;" I said "Yes"—he crossed over to Whistler, who gave him a small long parcel wrapped up, and said "Take this"—Hopper put them inside his coat in a pocket, and we all three walked into St. James's Street, Piccadilly, and went into a public-house, because it was raining hard—we came out and went to a public-house at the back of South Kensington Railway Station—Whistler said "Wait here while I get my man in"—I said that I would wait, and left them together—I let them get about a dozen yards, and then followed them and hid myself in a doorway at the corner of Queensberry Place, where there are two large pillar-posts; I watched and saw them go on the doorstep of No. 22, which was an empty house; Hopper went in and Whistler came from the doorstep—I ran back to the public-house where Whistler had left me—he came there and said "My man is in, we have got to be there between 7 and half-past"—it was then about 7 o'clock—he said "Between 7 and half-past go to the door, and you must scratch it, and Hopper will let you in"—that was the door of the empty house—I said that I would—we went up the Brompton Road a little way, and he took a silver-barrelled revolver from his pocket—I said, "What are you going to do with that?"—he said, "I will knock the first b—'s heart and liver out who tries to arrest me when I get the <hi rend="italic">stuff</hi>"—I said, "For God's sake, don't take any man's life, as you might get into serious trouble"—he said, "I shall have to do something to defend myself, as Hopper is going to defend himself with the <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> he has; the captain is coming to meet me, you call him <hi rend="italic">Jimmy</hi>, I will hand it over to him," meaning the revolver—when we got to White Horse Street, Piccadilly, on the right-hand side of the park railings, he said, "Here comes the captain," and Russell came up—Whistler said, "The man is in, be down from 7 to half-past "—he said he would be there with a Hansom's cab—Whistler then said to Kussell, "Take this, this man seems afraid," handing the revolver to him, and Russell went up White Horse Street—I went on with Whistler to the corner of Oxford Circus, and left him there—he asked me if I would meet him at the public-house in Park Lane at 6 o'clock; I said "Yes"—I went to Vine Street about 4 o'clock, and told Mr. Conquest all about it—I went to the public-house at, 6 o'clock, and Whistler came about 6.30—I was standing outside—he asked me about some matches, and I gave him two boxes of matches which I had received from the police—he wanted them as a signal for Hopper, who was in the house—he said,</p>

I never saw a cab, or had anything to do with one. There was no necessity to give any description of me.

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Policeman</hi> 502). On 18th December, about 12.45, I was on Ludgate Hill by Stationer's Hall Court—I saw Green and another man not in custody, under the lamp-post opposite No. 24, about 3 yards from the shop, on the footway facing the shop—I heard Green flay "<hi rend="italic">Cheese</hi> it, Bill"—that means "stop it," I believe—it excited my suspicion; I took no notice, but looked at several doors, and found No. 24 just behind them had been tampered with—I had examined that door 10 minutes before, and it was quite safe then—there is a little porch to No. 24 before you enter the door itself, and inside is a lobby about a yard square—in the centre of that outer door, about 4 ft. 6 in. from the ground, there is an inspection-hole about 6 inches square, with iron railings; it looks into the lobby—I looked through and saw Johnson crouched down inside—I took no more notice; I walked as far as Ave Maria Lane with my light on to get assistance—I found I could get none at the time, so I came back again—Green and the other man were about to separate—I said "No you don't," and seized Green by the collar, and pushed him into the doorway of 24, the other man bolted—Johnson, hearing the scuffle outside, ran up the staircase—Harvey had arrived at that time, and I handed Green over to him, and sent for Mr. White, who lives at No. 6—he found he could not unlock the door, it had been tampered with—with the assistance of two more constables I managed to force the door open and went upstairs—on the second floor back room the window was thrown open as far as it could be—towards the left, outside, a little drain-pipe runs down the corner of the house to relieve the roof of water—there were marks on it as if something had slipped down there—I searched the premises, but found no one there—I went out and woke up the people at No. 22, another jeweller's shop, Wales and McCulloch's, who gave us permission to pass through their passage to the yard at the back of their premises, which covers the whole of Mr. White's back premises as well—I searched the premises there, but could not find the prisoner, but I heard about 10 minutes afterwards that he had been caught in a packing-case—before I went there I had examined the shop-door of No. 24; the lock had been tampered with—that was one of three doors; there is the outer door, and inside that there are two doors, the shop door on the left and a door leading up the staircase; the street-door only had been tampered with—I found Green at the station when I went there—I searched, and on him found this brace, two bits (they are housebreaking implements), a box of matches, a piece of candle, a key, a strap, and 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on Johnson I found a piece of candle, an</p>

I saw no marks on the outside of the street door—I had looked through the inspection hole before, and I saw the jeweller's shop was quite secure—I believe it would take some time to open—the door entering the shop was properly secured with two padlocks—I saw no marks on the door till I got inside—I and the other police<lb/>man had forced the door open then; it may have been injured by our forcing it—the shop and corridor is lighted by gas, so that you can see into the corridor—I did not see you nearer than three or four yards to the door till I pushed you—I knew the door had been tampered with though I saw no marks on it—I went to 27, Neal Street; I saw no man named Holloway there, nor anyone who said they knew you by my description—I saw the landlord of the house—I got there about 3 a.m.—he said he knew nothing at all about you—he had not very long black whiskers—I did not show him this key.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. We had to carry Johnson upstairs at the station, he was bad then—he went upstairs from, the lobby on his hands and feet—he opened the door between the lobby and the stairs, and went upstairs—that door is a swing door open free for anybody—it would have shut directly he went through but that going up on his hands and feet I saw him go a little way before it shut—he did not move so wonderfully quickly—the staircase is immediately in front of the outer door, and the jeweller's shop at the side—the staircase does not communicate with the shop.</p>

On this morning I went to 24, Ludgate Hill to assist Welham—he left me on the first floor landing while he searched the upper part of the house—I afterwards went to 22, Ludgate Hill, where I found Johnson secreted in a packing case between Wales and McCulloch's two shops, which are distinct, with the passage running between them—the passage is covered and runs from the yard, which connects the back of 24 and 22, into the street, but there is a door at the end of the passage which would prevent Johnson from getting into the street—there were marks on the pipe where Johnson had lowered himself down—I pulled him out of the case and took him through the door which the other constables opened, into Ludgate Hill and to the station—when charged he said nothing.</p>

                  </hi> I live at Oak Terrace, Walthamstow—the deceased was my son, and was 13 years old—on Thursday afternoon, 16th Decem<lb/>ber, just before 2 o'clock, he went to school—he was then in good health—another little boy of mine, aged 11, was with him—that boy came back, and in consequence of what he said I went out with him and met Frank about 50 yards from my house—the prisoner was following behind with Thomas Robertson, another schoolboy—I asked the pri<lb/>soner why he hit Frank—he said because Frank had told me at dinner-time that he had knocked my little boy down—my son passed me and ran indoors—I did not know then that he was injured—on Sunday he was bad, and I applied hot flannels to him—I sent for Dr. Webb, but he did not come till Monday about 11—he then attended him till he died on the Sunday—on the Thursday before he died the prisoner came and asked Frank how he was—he said "I am very bad"—I said "You see what you have done to poor Frank; don't never hit another boy"—he said "I am very sorry; I hope Frank will get better"—then he said "I might have punched him in the stomach, but I did not look where I punched him"—I said "Frank will forgive you," and Frank said "I will forgive you, but don't hit me no more."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of High Street, Waltham<lb/>stow—on Monday morning, 20th December, I was called to see the deceased—he was in great pain in the stomach, especially the lower part—that was all the pain that he complained of to me—he was very tender over that part, so that I could scarcely examine him—he was vomiting a greenish fluid—his pupils were dilated, and there was some degree of fever—he also had a difficulty in passing his water—those were symptoms that would be caused by a blow in the stomach—he made no complaint of his back—I attended him till his death, which was early in the morn<lb/>ing of the 26th—he was suffering more or less from those pains until he died—by order of the Coroner, on the 28th I made a post-mortem examination—there were no external marks to account for death—the brain, lungs, and heart were quite healthy—the stomach was healthy save for some patches of blood poured out beneath the lining membrane—the intestines were much inflated, and matted together with the results of recent inflammation—there were several deposits of matter among the coils, especially in each groin, and at the back of the bladder—the intes<lb/>tines themselves were unruptured and quite healthy; as also were their contents—the other abdominal organs were quite healthy and unrup<lb/>tured—no natural causes would have caused what I found—the symp<lb/>toms were not consistent with death from natural pauses; they were wholly inconsistent—they were such as I should expect to find as the result of blows during life—what I found in the stomach was sufficient to account for his death—I did not tell him he was going to die.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been in the profession about two years—I am an assistant—I have never made a post-mortem, but I have seen them made—I was not called in on the Sunday; some other doctor was called in then—I first attended the boy on the Monday—I did not see that his throat was sore then; I didn't examine it; no complaint of that was made to me—he was not suffering from shivering; he was feverish—what he suffered from was peritonitis; that can be brought on by more than one cause; blood-poisoning would bring it on—I should not expect to find a sore throat as a result from death from peritonitis by blows—sore</p>

               <p>throat is not the first symptom of blood-poisoning; it is not neces<lb/>sarily a symptom at all; it may be marked—sore throat is not one of the chief and earlier symptoms of death from peritonitis; I stake my professional reputation upon that—it is not the general accompaniment; it may occur—a person may die of peritonitis brought on by blood-poisoning—I will not admit that sore throat is an early and marked symptom of blood-poisoning; it may be a symptom—I should not expect to find external marks of violence after three days and a half—it is one of the most common things in such serious instances as a blow on the stomach, from the buffer of an engine to have no marks whatever, and yet to have most serious internal injuries; I take that, as an extreme case—if one person strikes another in the stomach I should say there would probably be some external mark, but I should not be surprised if there were none after an interval of three days and a half—if the blow had had been violent I should expect to find some mark; I did not find any—I prescribed opium and limited milk diet, and some fomentations to the abdomen—peritonitis does not frequently come on suddenly from a quick chill; I should think it impossible—a ruptured intestine would cause it; in my opinion cold cannot cause it at all—peritonitis is inflammation of the membrane covering the bowels—inflammation of the bowels themselves may come on from chill, but it does not spread to the membrane—it is a fact that it does not, I cannot tell you why—Professor Bristow is an authority on these points—I agree in this, that "Peritoneal inflammation is a common occurrence in all ages and both sexes; it is due to various causes"—I do not agree that "in some cases it is the result of exposure to told or wet."</p>

I am a widow, of 364, Oxford Street, Stepney Green—on 25th November, about 11 a.m., the prisoner came to me—I had a card in my window, "A bedroom to let"—I let him the room—he said he came from Hammersmith, and was in a hurry to get a lodging as he was engaged to go to business that afternoon to Mr. Evans—he had no overcoat then—he came back a little after 5 o'clock with an overcoat on; he said it was not quite wide enough across the chest, and he asked for scissors to alter the buttons—I offered to mend it, and did so—it is the one he has on now—he said he was going to a place of amusement in the evening with a young man he had fallen in with, a teetotaler like himself—I gave him the key—he asked for a clock I had in my back parlour that he might know the exact time—he slept there that night, and left about 6.10 next morning—I went up to his room in less than an hour after he left—everything was gone from the bed, two blankets, two quilts, two sheets, toilet-cover, the clock, and everything—I went to the Thames Police-court—I next saw the prisoner in custody on December 9th, about three weeks after.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gas-fitter; of 36, Savona Street, Battersea—on 27th December, about midnight, I was turning out of Battersea Park Road, and when 15 or 20 yards down the street I received a blow at the back of my head which knocked me down—I tried to get up; I was seized by the back of my neck, and some one was pushing on my legs; I got upon my knees; I felt a hand passed into my pocket—I turned round and saw the prisoner's face within seven or eight inches of mine—I said, "You have not much of a catch, for I have only 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. "—he took the 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of my right-hand trousers pocket, and my keys and knife out of my left-hand pocket—he felt all my waistcoat and overcoat pockets—there were two others with him, I did not see their faces—I have seen the prisoner standing by the public-house continuously for the last seven or eight months as I have gone to my meals, I knew him well by sight—they then pushed me, and all three ran away, the prisoner last—my neck was a little stiff; my trousers were wet at the knees where I was pushed into the water and snow, they were spoiled—I have not the slightest doubt the prisoner is the man.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 9, Ashmore Place, Clapham Road—up to the 3rd November last the prisoner and his wife, Ellen Doyle, lived in that house—they occupied the whole of it, except one room, which was occupied by an old lady—I occupied the front room on the first floor—the old lady at this time was away staying with her son—I had been stopping there nine weeks—one night, early in October, I think it was, I was called by the deceased—I had gone to bed, and I think it must have been half-past 12 or 1—I found her lying down on the bed, and in the prisoner's presence she begged of me to stop in the room with her—the prisoner told me to go in my room, and she begged me to stop; she said she was afraid one of her ribs was hurt—the prisoner kicked her with his boots, and punched her, and I tried to catch hold of him to prevent him, and stood in front of her and begged of him not to strike her—he then went downstairs and she got up off the bed, and I went down<lb/>stairs with her, and stayed up with them till morning—she complained that she was very much hurt in one of her ribs; the prisoner was in the room at the time—in the morning he went out to do his work as usual—before this time I had heard words now and then—on Saturday, 13th December, about half-past 9 in the evening, I raw Mrs. Doyle—I had seen her before on that day—up to that evening I haft noticed nothing on her face which attracted my attention—about half-past 9 I was down<lb/>stairs in the front room talking to her, and the prisoner came in, and shortly afterwards I went upstairs—I then heard a little quarrelling, and a scuffling about, which lasted about 5 or 10 minutes, and I then heard the prisoner go out, and Mrs. Doyle called me downstairs—she was quite over; I have only seen her drunk one or twice—I had been working with her on this day—I stayed with her about five minutes, and then I went to my own room, but I did not go to bed; I sat up—about 12 o'clock, after the places were closed, I heard some one come in, and I assumed it was the prisoner—I then heard a deal of scuffling downstairs in the front room, and heard Mrs. Doyle say once "Oh, don't! oh,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701100095"/>
               <p>don't!"—the scuffling lasted half or three-quarters of an hour, but I was afraid to go down, because I had been ordered upstairs to my own room three times—I was dreadfully frightened—I did not go to the front door at all, because I heard him bolt it when he came in, but I was hanging out of my window as far as I could, trying to get someone to get a policeman—I saw a neighbour opposite, and begged of her to send for somebody—after this had gone on for about three-quarters of an hour all was quiet, and about 5 or 10 minutes afterwards the prisoner called my name—I went half way down the stairs and saw Mrs. Doyle lying stark naked behind the street-door, in the passage—I said to the prisoner "For God's sake carry her upstairs and put her on the bed"—the prisoner then took her up and carried her in his arms into his bedroom, and I showed him the lamp—she seemed unconscious—I then went into my own room—he remained in there with her about five minutes, and then came into my room where I was and said he would set fire to every b—thing in my room, and pitch me oat of window—before he came out of his room I heard him say he wanted to find his thick boots; he would kick her b—brains out—he was drunk when he came into my room—he stayed in there, and I sat with my window wide open—he was awake and dressed, and I think he had a pair of thin boots on—about 5 o'clock in the morning he went into his own bedroom and went to bed as near as I can tell—he carried his wife upstairs about half past 12—I sat up the whole of that night—on the next day, Sunday, about half past 9 or 10, somebody who I thought was the prisoner called oat to me to make a cup of tea for Mrs. Doyle; at that time he was in bed lying at the side of Mrs. Doyle—I made the tea and took her a cup and sat it on the floor—I could not say whether the prisoner was un<lb/>dressed; he was covered over with the clothes and I only saw her face partly; she had got two dreadful black eyes—she said very low "Put it down," and I put it down and left the room—just before one o'clock I saw them both again, and I just came outside my door as the prisoner was leading his wife downstairs—afterwards I saw her lying on the floor in the front parlour on some things at the side of the fire; the prisoner was there—she spoke to me very low, I could hardly hear her; he could not have heard what was said—she was dressed in her Sunday dress then—I went down again about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and she was just in the same place; she just spoke to me, but the prisoner could not hear what was said—I did not stop there long—I went down again in the evening after church time, about 8 o'clock, and saw both of them there; she was in the same condition and lying in the same place—I did not stay there very long—that is all I saw of them that day—I went to bed that night, and on the Monday I saw the prisoner and asked him how she was—he said "Much about the same"—he had never made any statement to me as to what was the matter with her—she never had fits; I never knew her to have one during the time I was there—during that Monday he went in and out two or three times very quickly; he is a sweep—I remained in the house until 11th December, except that I was in and out as I am a working woman—between the Monday and Wednesday I saw nothing of Mrs. Doyle—I went in and said could I do anything for her, but she said "No"—the prisoner told me on the Monday and Tuesday to take the orders and not leave the house or let anybody into the house—when</p>

               <p>I saw Mrs. Doyle she said she felt very ill—I forgot to say I heard a great jolting downstairs in their living room on the Saturday at the time of the struggling, and I thought it was Mr. Doyle jumping in the room—there was a small kettle of water on the hob on Saturday evening when the prisoner came in about half past 9; she generally kept a kettle of water boiling in case he came home and wanted to wash—I know this one was full; it would hold about two quarts—there was also a thin poker in the room about a foot or 15 inches long, which was generally inside the fender—it is a small kitchen range with a boiler on one side of the fireplace and an oven on the other side—a kettle would stand on the boiler—when the kettle was heated it would stand on the fire—there was a small round fender in front of the fire, but it does not come out into the room very far—there is no guard to the fire—the fire was alight on this night—I was at home when the police came on Wed<lb/>nesday, and it was after they came that a doctor was sent for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> There was only one kettle that I saw at this time; there were generally three full of hot water, and in the day time they would all be on the hob—I have seen them there—I don't know whether they hold two quarts each; the others may be larger—I have never seen two of them down underneath the fireplace while the other one was on the fire—I have seen the deceased drunk once or twice, but she has not been staggering; I could tell by the way she spoke to me and by her manner—she was not very firm upon her legs; she was lame and limped—she was a stout, short, and rather heavy woman, and I should say she was active; she was always about from morning till night—the fender did not project, it only went round—I did not notice any shovel or anything of that sort—there was not much furniture in the room.</p>

                  </hi>. I lived with my husband at 8, Ashmore Place, next door to the prisoner and his wife—at midnight on Saturday night, 13th November, I was in my house downstairs, in the adjoining room to the prisoner's—between half-past 12 and 1 I heard Mrs. Doyle scream very loudly and gradually get fainter and fainter—I also heard a great scuffling as if she was being knocked about, and I heard her say once "Oh, don't, Ted, pray don't"—it lasted for about 20 minutes or half an hour and then I fell asleep—I have known Mrs. Doyle for over ten years, and have lived next door during that time and have never known her to have a fit.</p>

On Wednesday, 17th Nov., about 10 a.m., in company with Police Constable Morier, I went to 9, Ashmore Place, and saw the prisoner—I was sent there by the inspector in consequence of information which had reached the station—I was in plain clothes—I said to him "I am a police officer, and have been informed that your wife is very ill through being assaulted"—he said "Oh no, she is all right"—I said "I don't believe she is all right, I must see her"—he said "She is not here, we had a row on Saturday, and she took her hook, and she is staying with her sister, near Primrose Hill"—this took place at the street-door—I made no reply, but com<lb/>menced to search—when I got to a front room on the first floor the prisoner took hold of the door-knob and said "Don't go in here, this room has nothing to do with me"—he let go and I went in, and found the prisoner's wife lying on a sack of chaff on the floor; she appeared to be undressed as far as I could see—she was covered with the rags of a</p>

(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "Between 8 and 9 p.m. on Saturday, 13th November, I went indoors and found my wife, who is subject to fainting fits, lying on the ground on her face. She could not speak. I lifted her up, when she said, 'Oh, my God! I spilt the boiling water all over me.' I took hold of her to carry her upstairs, and she screamed. I took her upstairs, and laid her down, and asked her if I should fetch a doctor. She said, 'No, I will be all right in a day or two,' I then went and bought some oil, and rubbed her where she was scalded. I asked her if she was going to the doctor. She said, 'No, I will stay where I am.' ") I produce the charge-sheet; it is entered here, "Assault<lb/>ing his wife on 13th inst., whereby her life was endangered."</p>

I am a surgeon practising at 344, Clapham Road—on 17th November, about 4 p.m., I was sent for, and went and saw the deceased at her house in Ashmore Place—I found her in a room upstairs, lying on the floor, on what I took to be some sacks, and she was covered with some old torn sheets which were saturated with oil and filth and dirt—she appeared to have nothing on but a chemise—there was no fire in the room—I asked her what was the matter with her, and she said it was an accident—I then examined her, and found she was terribly burnt and scalded about the lower part of the body, principally about the buttocks and all round the thighs—I noticed also she had two black eyes—on the right groin there was also a mark of a burn, as if</p>

               <p>some red-hot iron or something had been passed over it; it was between three and four inches in length, but was not very deep; I could not tell its depth because it was all crusted over—there was also a similar sort of burn over the left ankle, but only an inch and a half long; that was also crusted over—there was also a similar burn on the left wrist—the burns and scalds were distinct, and in my opinion from distinct causes—the scalds may have been caused by boiling water, but the burns could not have been so caused, most probably they were done by some hot iron; a kettle might have caused it if it had been struck off the fire, but I should say it would have been more likely done by a poker or a soldering-iron—if it had been done by a kettle you would have found a curve; I should not think that a fall upon a kettle would have produced those three wounds at one time—she was in a very low and weak state, and I considered her in a dangerous condition, and under my instructions she was removed to the infirmary.</p>

                  </hi>. I am medical officer of Lambeth Infirmary—I saw the deceased there about 7.30 on the evening of 17th November—I examined her—I found extensive injuries about the lower part of her person, the buttock and groin, arising either from scald or scald and burn—they were chiefly on the left thigh in front, inside, and there was what I took to be a burn at the back, deep and extensive—it extended from hip to hip practically—then there was one forming really part of that extensive burn just between the legs, within the folds of the buttock, deep and wide—that might be a continuation of the other—it formed part of the general burn, but was specially deep there—when the slough separated it would take in a fair-sized orange—that showed a depth of about three and a half inches broad, and about two inches deep—I also noticed a small burn on the right wrist, and one near the ankle on the left leg—in my opinion the scalds pro<lb/>ceeded from hot water—I do not think they could have been self-inflicted—I cannot imagine how the burns were caused—I should think by some flat surface like a hot iron—I think one hot iron may have caused all the burns that I saw—either the soldering iron or this poker might have produced those injuries—the poker appears rather small; the heat would soon go out of that, but either of these things might have done it; the soldering iron most likely—the space in which the orange might go was caused by granulation arising from suppuration that would fill up the cavity—it was a distinct deep hole going through the tissues right down to the muscles—I think</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="188701100099"/>
               <p>that the flesh had been absolutely burnt out with a hot iron or a poker; I can't understand how it could have happened—I don't think any of these burns could have been self inflicted—the deep wound in the groin could not have been done by the edge of a kettle; it must have been done by some other person than the sufferer—the woman had two very black eyes; she was very feeble and exhausted—she remained in that condition on and off down to the 13th December, when she died—on the 15th I made a post-mortem—I found there was a bruise on the left side just below the nipple, leading down to a broken rib—I should say that bruise had been inflicted within a short time prior to her admission; she was nearly a month in the house—it was from a blow—I found four more ribs on the left side also broken, two of them in two places, inflicted about the same date I should say—on the right side there were five more broken ribs, but of older date; I mean within three months certainly—the fracture of these ribs was caused by direct violence—I also found a flesh wound on the forehead, not a very serious one—in the intestines I found an ulceration in the duodenum which is not unfrequently found in the cases of burns and scalds—in my opinion the woman died from ex<lb/>haustion consequent upon the injuries from which she was suffering; I include the burns, scalds, and broken ribs—there was no sign as to her having been a drunken woman—I should say she was not a total abstainer, but not a drunkard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The burns may possibly have been caused by falling upon a hot metal or hot coals—whether the metal was applied to the body or the body to the metal I could not say—I think no person could possibly have inflicted such pain upon themselves—I can't understand how the deep burn I speak of could have been done by accident—I no doubt said before the Magistrate it might have been done at one time by an accident; I mean it might be done by a fall against hot metal—I don't think a fall against a kettle would inflict such deep injuries—I am prepared to say it could not, on account of the deepness of the wound—I don't think the bottom of a kettle could do it—the chief injury was con<lb/>siderably smaller than the smallest kettle that is made, and would be the size of this instrument—I don't think the round rim of a kettle would do as much; it would be considerably larger than this—the scalds might have been caused by a kettle tipping over.</p>

We were standing in the corner of the yard—we pushed two gates open to get into the yard—it was like the side of the house—we commenced playing in the street, and went round—there is a blank wall in the outer yard—we were by the dust-bin—it was a dark night—I told Gardiner we were coming round—I said "We are going to give you the waits"—we had been doing the same thing before—the verdict of the Coroner's Jury was "Death by misadventure."</p>
