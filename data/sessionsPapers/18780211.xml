                  </hi>. I am now living at 3, Herne Road, Brixton—I am separated from my husband—in December, 1876, I was living at 298, Kennington Road—I had full power to let the whole of the house No. 98, Fleet Street, with the exception of the shop, which was occupied by Mrs. Judkins—before October, 1876, I only knew Colls by seeing him come in and out to a tenant of mine—I had about nine tenants in the upper part of the house—in October, 1876, Colls applied to me to take some rooms at 98; I replied that I would not let them unless the rent was paid in advance—the rent was 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year, a quarter was to be paid in advance—he said he was quite willing to do that, but he had not the cash in hand directly—I said "I will wait till you have, but I won't let them till I have my rent in advance"—he repeatedly came to me respecting them, but the matter remained on that footing till 16th December—he then brought me this lease (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and said he had been trying to borrow 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon it as he had done before, but that his solicitor, Mr. Ody, was very ill, and could not lend it him; but if I would, let him have some money, with the rooms, he would deposit the lease with me as security—on perusing the lease I asked him what benefit he reaped from it—he said 26<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I then arranged to let him the two back rooms for one year and give him a receipt for the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in advance for the quarter and advance him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and that he should have the carpet and table so that he would not have to buy it, as he said he had no furniture for offices; the Turkey carpet was to be 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the table 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the agreement was made at 98, Fleet Street, in my own sitting-room; my servant, Mrs. Bowley, was present, cleaning and drubbing the room—I let him have 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on that occasion, as I had no more in my pocket, and he gave me an I. O. U. for it; he was to come</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="187802110002"/>
               <p>to my private house for the remainder, which he did that evening—Mrs. Bowley let him in, and my daughter Katie and my daughter-in-law, Mrs. Hemming, were present, when I gave him a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note and he handed me the lease—these two documents marked A. and B. are in his writing, and we signed them. (<hi rend="italic">Read</hi>: "A. Received of Mrs. Appleford 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Arthur Colls. December 16, 1876." "B. I promise to return to Mr. Arthur Colls the lease of three houses situated at Sheerness, Kent, on being paid 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by the 23rd January, 1877, or to be renewed as may be arranged between Mr. Colls and myself. Annie Appleford. December 16, 1876.") When I parted with the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I of course thought the lease was genuine, or I should not have let him have sixpence—the carpet and table were moved into the front room on that same day, but I locked it up and did not give him possession till the 23rd, when this agreement was signed—it is the prisoner's writing, my solicitor drew the copy of it. (<hi rend="italic">This was a memorandum of agreement to take the two rooms as offices at</hi> 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. <hi rend="italic">a year, pay<lb/>able quarterly</hi>. ) It is signed by him—in January, 1877, I was taken ill with pleurisy—I was then living in Fleet Street; the doctor would not allow me to be removed; I was in bed for ten weeks there—on 8th January the prisoner brought his wife and daughter to live there, not with me, but in the same house—at the latter part of January, or the beginning of February, I gave my daughter 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay some taxes—the prisoner said he was going that way and would pay them for me to save her going, as it was raining fast, and I gave him the 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I after<lb/>wards found he had not paid it, and asked him for it; he promised to give it me, but did not—he said he would give me an undertaking for it, and that it might go off the deed—he gave me this memorandum: "I hereby authorise you to deduct 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further from the deed you hold of mine, Jan. 23, 1877." About the 9th February he applied to me to lend him 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. further on the lease, as there was a warrant out for his body for his taxes at Forest Hill—I said I could not let him have 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I would let him have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and as I had not so much with me I let him have 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., for which he gave me this I O U—I parted with that, believing the lease to be worth 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., as he said I should be safe up to 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I would not have let him have the money but for that belief—I recovered from the attack of pleurisy about the middle of March—it was at the latter part of March that I had information with regard to Mr. Hawkins's receipt of the rents of those houses—I had suspicion before, and in the middle of March I told the prisoner I had reason to believe that the lease of these premises which he had given me as security was not worth the parchment it was written upon, and if such was the case I should certainly punish him unless he returned me the money<lb/>he said he was quite aware that the lease was of no service when he gave it me, that he had been ejected, and I might do my best and my worst, that he had been offered 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by Mrs. Judkins to take possession of my premises before that day month, and I should be outside of them, and he did it and threw my furniture into the street—he further said he thought he should have done business and then he would have paid me<lb/>I afterwards applied to a Magistrate for a warrant, which was granted in the early part of May—I was not well enough to appear before—I was told that the officers could not find him, and I did not know he was in custody till afterwards—I subsequently got a summons, and he was taken before a Magistrate and committed.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner</hi>. The agreement was made on 23rd December—there was one made on the 16th, but my solicitor advised me not to give up possession upon it—I swear that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was advanced on the 16th; it was not for interest—when I was taken ill I gave the lease to my daughter and son with other deeds—I should say that I had it in my possession on 1st January, 1877, at my Kennington house—I did not engage you as my agent, I am always my own agent, I employ no one, I never gave you authority to do anything for me—I might have instructed you to distrain on Mr. Brown for 17<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for a quarter's rent; just for an hour while I went to get an order to go in possession—a man named Carroll was put in possession—I did not owe any rent to Mrs. Judkins—I did not ask you, as my husband had deserted me, to come and keep possession of the house for me—if an execution was put in on my goods for 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it was a sham affair, it was withdrawn without a farthing payment—I did not offer Hammond, the broker's man, half-a-crown to settle it, he gave me the warrant voluntarily—I swear I gave you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in cash on 9th February—you were not maintaining me, I never had a meal from you—I did not tell you to sue my husband for my maintenance, I always kept myself—I have never received a bill of 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from yon for six weeks' board and attendance—I was never applied to for that amount—I did not write a letter to my husband for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to provide necessaries for myself and child—you wanted me to write it, but I said no—I am bringing an action against Mrs. Judkins for illegal distraint—a man named Joy came and broke open a door and took possession, planned, I believe, by you—I telegraphed to you for Carroll's address, and sent to the station for a policeman to come and take charge of the premises till I could get him—two policemen came—I did not suggest that you should tome in as a <hi rend="italic">bon fide</hi> lodger, and keep possession under the Lodgers' Act—I allowed your wife and daughter to come for a week as you were obliged to leave your lodgings, and a memorandum was drawn up to that effect—I sent to Mr. Hammond for it, that I might indict you for false swearing—I don't know that you are an important witness against me in the actions—I have not offered you money to come on my side or sent any one to intimidate your witnesses—I went to Mr. Hammond's, not to intimidate him, but to ascertain if he lived there—Mr. Cooper, my solicitor, took out a summons against Joy for an assault; the summons was adjourned six times because I was ill—I did not employ you to make my will, you were the attesting witness—at the time the distraint was in, on 8th January, I did not send down to your wife some chairs, a timepiece, and some bedding, asking her to protect them—I was never bound over to keep the peace—you did not tell me when you put the lease into my hands that it was worthless, or that it might be worth 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—you did not tell me that it had been out of your possession six years—you made a charge against me at the police-court about this table and got me locked up—I was not locked up at Warwick for pawning stays—I have never charged men with indecent assaults—I have not had a good many solicitors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re examined</hi>. It was in December last year that the prisoner locked me up about the table, the very day after the bill was preferred against him—he appeared before the Magistrate and charged me with stealing the table, but the Magistrate discharged me immediately.</p>

               <p>years of age—in December, 1876, we were living at 298, Kennington Road—there was a money box there, I had the key of it—I remember seeing the prisoner there on one occasion; I opened the box, I left mamma to take out the money; there was a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note, I believe, but I did not notice exactly what money it was—I am sure the prisoner was there at the time, he brought a deed wrapped up in paper—I remember having some money in an envelope to go and pay some taxes, I can't say how much money there was, the prisoner had it, he said he would go and pay the taxes—I was living with my mother, at 98, Fleet Street, at the time she was ill—the prisoner and his wife and daughter were there—mamma nearly always provided the food for the house, or gave them the money for it—I saw the lease afterwards, mamma had it.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a general shop at 50, Cheshire Street—the prisoners are neighbours of mine—the child came to me last August for a quarter of a pound of yellow soap, and tendered a shilling—I doubted it, but knowing her I gave her the change and put it in the till where there was no other money—a few minutes afterwards another little girl came in and asked me for a shilling for sixpenny worth of halfpence and sixpence; my husband gave her this shilling, and three or four minutes afterwards she came back and said that it was bad—the girl was this girl's bigger sister, and she told me that her other sister gave it to her—I recognised it as the same shilling, I am positive of it—I gave it to the constable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 13, Colton Street, Mile-end—I was a warehouseman in the service of the Carron Company, in Thames Street, for two and a half years—I am 23 years of age—the company sell ranges and ironwork of all descriptions—when I sell property I do not know the price of the articles, they have a number—on Thursday, 17th January, I was at the warehouse—about 12 o'clock I saw the prisoner there, he had been there on previous occasions and I had sold him goods—I knew his name but not his address—he asked me for a jamb-plate and copper door (I wont with him into the underground part of the warehouse) the value of which I believe would be 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—after selecting them I went with him upstairs—he said he wanted to look at some ranges—I took him up to the third floor, and he selected a closed range—he then said "Can you let me have the range without the people in the counting-house knowing anything about it?"—we went on explaining the working of the range for a few minutes, after that he said if I would</p>

               <p>let him have it he would give me 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I hesitated for some time and afterwards said I would try and do so—nothing more passed—we went down into the warehouse—I saw Mr. Stevens, the warehouse clerk, and had the jamb-plate and copper door booked—I got this check and filed it in the counting-house—that was to enable the cashier to make out the invoice—I left the prisoner in the counting-house to pay for the articles—I returned to the third floor and lowered the range into the prisoner's truck which was in the yard, in charge of his man, Bryant—I then went over to a public-house, the prisoner beckoned me there—we had a glass of ale, and he gave me 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he was short of money, or he had no more money—nothing was said about my getting the other 20<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—we did not remain more than two minutes in the public-house, and when I went back to the yard the truck had gone—next evening, about a quarter-past five, Bryant came to me, he made some statement—I then found that when I had lowered the range the stop-cock and the bottom plate had been accidentally left behind; I gave them to Bryant—I did not have them booked—shortly afterwards I was sent for, and Mr. Young spoke to me on the subject; he had the stop-cock and bottom, they had been taken from Bryant—I told Mr. Brown, the assistant manager, all that had occurred with the prisoner the previous day—on Monday, the 21st, I went with Moss, the officer, to 37, Pigot Street, Limehouse, and there saw a kitchen range, which I identified as the one I had lowered down.</p>

               <p>January, about 10 minutes to 5, Smith came to me and wanted me to take an order in hand for him for a pair of black trousers and waistcoat—it passed over till Wednesday, and I declined to take it, as I had an order in hand from the firm at the time—it is usual for the workmen to have a permit from the firm if they want clothes made up, and I advised Smith to get a permit in the usual way—Walker afterwards brought me a sheet, and I cut out the things—on Friday, the 11th, as I was going down<lb/>stairs, I saw Arenberg going out with a parcel through the workmen's door, which I thought not the right way—I afterwards went to Chap<lb/>man's public-house, at the corner of Bow Lane—Smith came in with a parcel under his arm—I said "Have you got the stuff all right?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Have you paid for it?"—he said "Yes"—I said "Did you get a receipt?"—he said "No"—I said I thought he was a fool—we afterwards went to the Poulterers' Arms—I asked him to show me the goods, and he did so; they were the trousers and waistcoat that I had cut out—they are worth 22<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said he had made up his mind to give information to Mr. McPherson—he is the buyer and manager—I afterwards spoke to Mr. McPherson.</p>

Thompson" and "Jacob Elwood," said "Do you know anything of these?"—he said "Yes, that is my writing," pointing to the endorsement—he also said "Mead gave them to me and told me what names and addresses to write upon them. He sometimes used to give me half a sovereign. I understood they were proceeds of a betting transaction." He also said that Mead told him to get them changed at the Bank of England, and what names and addresses to write upon them—I then asked him if Mead had ever given him any other notes to get changed at the Bank of England—he replied "Yes, and he told me what names and addresses to write upon them"—I asked him if a portmanteau which was in the room was Mead's—he said "Yes, he sent it to my house"—I said, "Did you know it was coming?"—he replied, "Yes, he sent me a telegram to say that it was coming"—Mead was then in another room.</p>

I offered him the change; he said, "No, I have got holes in my pockets, I will lend you that for your wife and family." When we got to Enfield he burst the door of this house open and asked me to go in. I said, "No, I won't, I will go home; here is your ticket," and as I was going along I got knocked down and lost the ticket. I was taken to the police-station, and they took that newspaper from me and ripped it in two, and now bring it forward as evidence against me.</p>

I never had any quarrel with the prisoner—I don't think he intended to hurt me, but he intended to kill his wife—that was the second attempt he has made—his wife had been staying with me. since Christmas—Robinson has lodged at my house off and on 13 months—Mrs. Potter only had a bedroom; her room adjoined Robinson's—I remember the prisoner calling one day, about 10 days before this occurred; he saw his wife on that occasion—I was present part of the time—while she was staying with me she went out with Robinson once or twice—they came home late once—I know Mrs. Dixon, of East India Road—I never said to her that Robinson and the prisoner's wife had been living together—I remember meeting the prisoner on New Year's eve at the George <hi rend="largeCaps">IV</hi>., at Poplar—his wife was outside in the road—I don't know whether he asked me where she was or not; he asked if I had heard from her, and I said I had not heard from her lately—I had not heard from her because I was with her—I did not say that when I had last heard from her she had gone with her sister's children to Ireland, or that she had gone in the country—when I first knew them they seemed happy together—I remember his coming and asking her to return to him, and promising to be a kind husband to her—she said she would never live with him again—I heard him ask what the child's name was—I did not hear what she said—she never told me that she had received letters from Robinson—as far as I know the prisoner had always been a steady, sober man, I never knew anything to the contrary.</p>

"Dear friends—I write these few words to let the world know that the cause of taking my wife's life, and then my own, is because she has left me to live with another man of the name of Robinson, an engineer, and it is more than I can bear to think that my child should be under the control of another man, and me alive; that alone has driven me to the course that I am about to<lb/>pursue, which I can swear before the One that knows the secrets of all hearts that there never was a more loving husband in the world than I have been, and she knows that and every one else that knows me; I would do all that could be done for her in the world if she would only come to me again, for I am not ashamed to own before the whole world that I love her dearer than my own life; but I must let the world know that Alfred Beresford's wife, of 146, East India Road, Poplar, was the cause of my wife's taking up with this said Robinson. I hope that the world won't think that it is through jealousy, but it is the idea of her depriving me of my rights of being with her and my darling boy; God bless his dear little innocent heart, I love him dearly. My dear friends, believe me, I am truly heart-broken, therefore I care not to live. I hope that this will be published directly after I am dead for the sake of justice. I hope and trust that some of my family will take my darling child and bring him up. I should like for my sister to have him. My sister's address is Miss M. Potter, Mr. R. J.

I reside at 64, Popham Road, Islington—I was foreman bricklayer in the defendant's employ on the buildings in Ken<lb/>mere Road, Hackney—the deceased was also a bricklayer employed by Mr. Hackett—the houses consist of a row of five—I remember the deceased working on the house next to the end of the five on 16th January—I re<lb/>member the wall falling—it was the end wall of the fifth house—I did not see it fall—it fell out—I saw the deceased taken out alive, somewhere about half-past 3—he was employed in building a wall in connection with the houses which were being constructed, in connection with the wall that fell; in the house that was going to be commenced next to it—he was getting the footings in for the adjacent house.</p>

                  </hi>. I am district surveyor for West Hackney—I visited these houses on four or five occasions—I was there on 11th January—the wall was then nearly up to the roof—it was a nine-inch wall, with 14 inches base on the basement story, and the roof was not on—if the roof had been on this would not have happened, because it would get</p>

               <p>a protection from frost and changes of atmosphere, and it would have made a tie to keep it in its place—I complained of the mortar to one of the men, not the defendant—the mortar was not good enough; it was unequal—it had not been knocked about enough to make it assimilate with the sand which was with it—some of the mortar was very good, because they have tossed it and kicked it about, and that made an effect on it.</p>

Some of the sand was sharper than the rest—Hackney is first-rate gravel and they dig it out, and use the sand for their mortar—I apprehend it was mixed with that—the rest was from brick rubbish which had been brought into the road—there was no road sand that I noticed—you could not tell after the lime was with it, but it made the mortar dark and it looked worse than it really was, because a gentleman had some of it washed and he found more sharp sand than he expected.</p>

I do not think the wall that fell was so good as the other; the mortar was not so good—if it had been dry weather, and the lime had had time sufficient to set, I have no doubt that with the roof on it would have been standing now—I went there on four or five occasions—it was on the second occasion, in the earlier part of December, that I first noticed the character of the mortar—I spoke to the foreman on that occasion—we call the foreman down or speak to him on the scaffold<lb/>with a 9-inch wall the bricks were different; some were old and some were new, that made it bad for the plastering—I saw Hackett on two or three other occasions, and noticed the mortar then; it varied at differenttimes—it depends upon how they mix it, and I told him again that he must do his work better, and on the 11 th we saw the irregularity and served him with this notice by post. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the defendant was not conforming to the rules of the Building Act. It required him within</hi> 48 <hi rend="italic">hours to render the building conformable to the Act; and required the walls to be properly bonded and put together, not less than one brick and a half thick in the lowest story</hi>.) I do not say there that the whole was to be taken down; I treat it generally—it could be properly bonded without taking down—I gave him a week to do it in—he promised to do it, and commenced working at it—the week had not expired—after I served that notice he called on me in the City, with a friend—I told him he must do the work better and explained what he would have to do—that was on Monday, the 14th—I told him his mortar must be better, and the labour must be put together better—he first of all urged that it was very good—I told him that he would have to underpin part of it and bond it in cement—he said he would do all that was required—I told him if he did not he would find himself at Worship Street the next week, and probably the week after at the Old Bailey, for manslaughter—I said that to make him do his work properly—I spoke figuratively, to impress it on his mind; not that I had anything in my mind but that when I saw him again he would do the work—this was on the Tuesday—they thickened the back wall, but they had not done anything to this wall—he said the materials were good; I said they were very bad—I think I said they were the worst that I had seen—the labour was bad, the way in which it was put together—the mortar had not enough lime in it, and the build<lb/>ing was run up too quickly—I only know Hackett through the notice—I saw him again after the accident—I saw the building on the Tuesday, Hackett was then at work on it—I inspected the premises after the acci<lb/>dent—the fall of the wall was caused by the premature removal of the</p>

The mortar ought to have been better mixed; the labourers do that—it was windy that afternoon—in my opinion the brick<lb/>layers had run up the wall too quickly; there had been no dry weather, and there had been frosts at night, and this being only a 9-inch wall and the mortar not being properly mixed it acted on the mortar—I gave him a week to do it in, and he was at work, but it unfortunately fell before the week expired.</p>

I live at 63, Nightingale Road, and am Mr. Legg's clerk—he directed me to go to these houses, and I went three or four times before the accident, but noticed nothing with regard to this par<lb/>ticular wall—I saw it on 11th January—the whole of the premises were not such good work as we usually put in that class of buildings—I have had to overlook work before—I noticed that the mortar was bad, and first spoke to the foreman about it in November, with reference to that block of houses, but not in reference to that particular house; they were not all going on then—I only knew that John Hackett was building the houses from the notice that was given—he found the money, but I do not know who was the actual builder—I do not know the name of the man I spoke to—he was not engaged on that particular house, and I did not see him in reference to it—once I saw the foreman and once Mr. Hackett—I told him that the work was not going on well, the mortar was bad, and that I had not seen worse—I spoke generally with regard to the three houses—I was then outside the buildings on the ground, and they were working on the sixth house—I have been with Mr. Legg from 1862—Hackett said that he had not seen me there before—I told him to do his work better; the wall was then very nearly up—I do not think that wall was any worse than the other part of the same block of houses—I went there twice on the 11th, and on the second occasion with Mr. Legg—I did not see Hackett then—I do not think he was there in the afternoon, but Mr. Legg spoke to the foreman—I knew nobody as the builder but Hackett—there were four or five men on that block—I saw the premises after the wall fell—I did not direct my attention to the wall—I was with Mr. Legg, and I had no authority—I think the wall fell because the bricklayer who laid the bricks did not put the work together well and built it too quickly—I looked at the mortar; it was bad, and was part of the same which I had described as the worst I had ever seen—that had partly caused the fall, because it had not had time to set—I saw them removing the scaffold-poles on the morning of the accident—I saw the defendant on the morning of the accident, when I went to the building, but I did not speak to him because he had had the notice to alter it, and I did not go on the building—I did not notice that it was windy.</p>

               <p>was very gross, and he would not let me off. I was forced to fight. I made it an excuse that the man was shaving, but he forced me to stand on my defence. I did not strike him till he struck me at the pit of my stomach. I was obliged to strike him, or I should have been knocked down and kicked. I neither wanted to commence or to continue it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City Detective</hi>). On the 15th January I received a warrant for the apprehension of Parker in the name of Warren—on the 16th I went with Marshall to 2, Warren Street, Tottenham Court Road—I saw the two male prisoners let themselves into the house with a latch key—I followed to the top floor front room with Marshall, where I found the four prisoners—I told them all I was a detective, and that I should arrest Parker and Johnson for passing in the name of Warren at No. 6, Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square, and for forging and uttering reference tickets of a <hi rend="italic">Bazaar</hi> paper and thereby obtaining different kinds of property from different persons—I could not read the warrant, for there was a little scuffing, but I told them I had a warrant—Parker said "I know nothing about the name of Warren, I have always had to work hard for my living and you cannot prove anything to the contrary"—Johnson said "I know nothing about the name of Warren, I am a tailor, and these are two young women that we know''—I asked the women if they were married to the men—they said "No"—I said I should arrest them on my own responsibility for being concerned with the men in forging and uttering these tickets—each woman said "I knew there was something wrong, but all I have had to do with it is to pledge the things that have been given to us by the men"—the female Parker said "I have known Parker (meaning Warren) for about eighteen months, I knew him through meet<lb/>ing him at a music hall''—I then gave Johnson into the custody of Marshall—I requested Parker to turn out his pockets, he did so—there were a number of old letters and memoranda; amongst them was a letter un<lb/>opened bearing the Halifax post-mark of 15th January; it was addressed to Mr. A. Wyld, 125, Drummond Street, Euston Road—that letter I afterwards found to contain a diamond ring—I produce the letter and the ring—I pointed to a cage of canaries in the room and said ''Whose is that?"—the female Parker said "It is mine, I paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for them"—I asked whose cockatoo that was—Stiles said "That is mine," and I asked, pointing to a dead parrot, "Whose is that?"—Stiles said, "That is mine too, and the poor devil died last night"—I afterwards searched the room and found a number of memorandum forms in the name of Charles Warren and corresponding with the two produced, except that there is no writing on them—I also found a number of forged reference tickets in the name of J. Wyld, 125, Drummond Street, Euston Road, and a number in the name of C. Warren, 6, Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square—I also found fourteen pawn tickets in the drawer and in the cupboard, and these four copies of the <hi rend="italic">Bazaar</hi> paper in which a number of advertisements are marked for the sale of everything, from a donkey to a diamond—the writing opposite the advertisements is like the writing on the memoran<lb/>dum to Mrs. Watts—I also found a number of letters in a similar hand<lb/>writing, some of them relate to the advertisements which are marked.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOLFE</hi>. We have 2, 300 on our books; our customers are more—a clerk usually makes inquiries—speaking roughly, I receive about 100, 000 applications a year—each ticket is printed sep<lb/>arately—they differ in number, address, and date—they are alike at the back—the die has always been the same as now—it would take a year to search for the names and addresses of our customers—we have 30 or 40 books of 10, 000 each—I have not seen our reference tickets pasted on paper—the imitation is a good one, and could not easily be detected—Mr. Howden was put on our books in 1875—he is still a customer—he communicated with me—he keeps his own tickets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. I received this telegram from Mr. Howden: "Warn your readers of forged reference ticket, No. 1161. I will send you letter by next post," This circular (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) will sufficiently describe our system—this is a copy of the advertisement I received, signed "Charles Parker"—it is similar writing to these memoranda, and refers to canaries—a customer has the right to put a star to his advertisement when his references are satisfactory.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-called</hi>). I have now searched and found the advertisements referred to by letters that have been put in as received by the last witness—in five cases the advertisements are marked in the copies found in the prisoners' possession—some of the letters are addressed from Warren Street—I have traced the prisoners to 16 or 17 other addresses.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. WOLFE</hi>. The charge at Acton was about August last—the room the prisoners occupied in Warren Street was at the top of the house—it was a front room, and used as bed and sitting-room—there was a parrot cage, a cockatoo cage, and a cage of canaries—I did not caution Johnston, but I told him who I was—Stiles said the parrot and the cockatoo were hers—I went there about 8. 30—there was but one bed<lb/>stead in the room, which was in a filthy state—there was room for more than two.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Detective Sergeant</hi>). I went with Andrews to Warren Street and apprehended Johnston and Stiles—the charge was explained to them—Johnson handed me this parcel—it was registered—it was unopened—I asked him what it was—he said "I don't know, I have just received it through the post, and now that you have got us I may as well hand it over to you—I also took a bundle from him—I found half a pawn ticket in the drawer, corresponding to this (<hi rend="italic">The ticket produced by Donaldson's assistant</hi>), relating to the Albert chain—I found in the drawer another ticket relating to the silver watch, which was pledged on 11th January by Mary Stiles—I found 14 tickets all together in the drawer, and one on Johnson, which Parker said she pledged in the name of Davis, having received it from Johnson and returned him the ticket—there was only one ticket found in the name of Stiles—all the others are Parker's—there was also also a little dog, which has been re<lb/>turned to its owner in Yorkshire—the woman said in reference to it "That came in a hamper last night"—I returned it in the same hamper.</p>

I have pleaded guilty to an indictment charging me with stealing 12 quarters of oats, the property of my master—on Wednesday, 2nd November, I was in Green and Andrews's employmen as warehouseman—my hours were from 6 a. m. to 6 p. m.—the clerk used to come at 9 o'clock—if persons came for goods between 6 and 9 I should deliver them, but they would have to produce an order to me, and I should give the clerk the particulars when he came—on the Monday morning before this Friday Fearn came to the wharf and said "Is Ted the carman in?"—I said "He has left"—there had been a man named Edward Foster in the employment—Fearn asked me if I would have a glass—I said I would not mind, and we went to a public-house down Thames Street, where he said "Can you let me have some oats; I used to have some when Ted was here, can't you let me have some?"—I said I could not give him a decided answer then, I would let him know—I had known him before—he gave me his address, Cable Street, Shadwell—I went there between 7 and 8 o'clock on the Wednes<lb/>day evening—it is a corn chandler's shop—I said to him "You can come for some oats"—he asked me what time—I told him about 7—he said "I will come to-morrow morning," and we went in and had a glass—he came on Thursday or Friday morning, I won't be sure which; it was a little after 7 o'clock—he only came once—I loaded his van with 15 quarters instead of 12, in 30 sacks—I can't say the value, but he gave me 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—his carman took away the van with the oats in it, and I went with him and Partridge to drink at a public-house—he gave me no de<lb/>livery order—I was unable to give an account of the oats disappearing, and I absented myself for two or three days.</p>

On 9th November, about 10 a. m., I went with Detective Pott to the prisoner's shop, 296, Cable Street, Shadwell—I told him we were police-officers, and he would be charged with receiving, on 2nd November, between 7 and 8 a. m., 12 quarters of oats from a man in the employ of Green and Andrews, knowing them to be stolen—he said "I did receive them; I paid him 16<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter"—I said "Have you any here?"—he said that he had four sacks full and four empties, pointing to where they stood—the four full ones had the name of Green and Aldridge on them, with the address—I showed them to Mr. Green—the prisoner said that he had sold the rest to his customers—I asked where the sacks of the rest were—he said "I sent them up to the firm two days after,'' and that he had no receipt for the money—I took him to the police-court, where he was discharged by the Alderman; but a bill was found by the Grand Jury against him, and I took him in custody again on a Bench warrant—he said "I thought it was all over"—I said nothing about Barham—on 13th December I went to Flowers, from information I received, and received 10 sacks—I heard Flowers examined at the police-court—he is ill, and there is no prospect of his being here.</p>

I live at 6, Goldsmith's Place, Kilburn—I was at the Albert Edward on 25th January—I came out about 12 p.m. with Newport and Whelburn—I have known Whelburn two or three years—I have been living with him about a fortnight—I heard him say to Whel<lb/>burn that he had stowed the boy away in the taproom, and placed two coal-scuttles and a board in front of him—I went towards the stable door to go to bed, and said, "Charlie, I am getting quite sleepy"—he says, "Well, you can go to bed; I ain't coming in yet"—I heard New<lb/>port pass a remark to Whelburn, and I said I should deliberately go and tell the landlord what I had heard—he said, "For God's sake don't go, George, you will get us all into disgrace"—I said, "I cannot help what disgrace I get you into, but I cannot see myself in disgrace or my lodg<lb/>ing"—I went to the landlord.</p>

I am an assistant to the last witness—I was in the shop when the prisoners came, and heard part of what took place—the following morning I went to the bank with the two parcels done up in one—in consequence of what the clerks said to me I brought the parcel back, and coming along Cheapside I saw the prisoners in a cab—I fol<lb/>lowed them to Bishopsgate Street, they got out and ran away—I spoke to a constable, who stopped Lucas, and Truscott was stopped by another constable.</p>

I keep a beer shop at 129, Devonshire Street, Mile End—about 3 a. m. on 16th January I heard a noise, and waited for a policeman twenty minutes—I opened my window and spoke to a police<lb/>man—I then went downstairs—I missed a cruet-stand and a silver thimble—I found my ladder in the Foresters' club-room—it had been taken from the passage and let down into the room, which had been entered in that way—the ladder was locked up, but the place had been broken open—a number of cigars were lying on the counter, and the place was in great disorder—all these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are my property.</p>

On the morning of 16th January I was on duty in the neighbourhood of the prosecutor's house—my attention was attracted by Mrs. Stephenson calling out at the window—I saw the prisoners leave the prosecutor's house and come over a side wall by some almshouses next door—a side door leads from the premises into the alms<lb/>house grounds—I went into the grounds and said "Halloa! what's your game here?"—they made a full stop—I rushed and caught Palmer—Mole slipped by me into the street—I saw him the next day at the station, when I picked him out from others—I am sure Mole is the other man.</p>

I did not mention my going into the grounds at the police-court—I said I met the prisoners coming out of the grounds—I did go into the grounds—I sprang my rattle—I identified Mole on 17th January—I gave my evidence on 16th—I saw Inspector O'Callaghan before identifying Mole—he did not speak to me about Mole; he told me to go into the library—Mole was not there—O'Callaghan said "256, this way; do you see anybody here you have seen before?"—Palmer's name was not mentioned before I saw Mole—Mole was not put among policemen, but among nine or ten men taken from the street—it was about 9 p. m.—Mole was in the charge-room—I passed through the charge-room to go to the library—only policemen were there then.</p>

               <p>morning—he did not have tea, he had cocoa, that was his habit—at first I partook of two cups with milk and sugar, the third cup I poured out without milk and sugar, and there was a large sediment rose to the top and went like water—the first two cups tasted very unpleasant, that attracted my attention—I put the contents of the third cup in a bottle and corked it down, and took care of it—my husband was not present when I did that—I put it in a drawer in my bedroom—a few mornings after that I found a paper containing a dingy white powder in the pocket of a waistcoat which my husband had been wearing, it was wrapped in blue paper; I took a portion of it, wrapped it up in a piece of white paper, and kept it in my pocket, and on the Thursday before Christmas I took it to a chemist and showed it to him, and afterwards my sister handed it to Dr. Robertson in my presence, and I also gave him the bottle on the Friday after Christmas, when he came to attend me—I told my husband that I knew I was suffering from this poison, and I must tell the doctor what it was—he told me to tell the doctor I had made a mistake in putting the sugar of lead into my tea in place of the soda, as the doctor would soon get me well and nobody would know anything about it—the doctor saw me in my husband's presence, and I told the doctor what my husband had told me to say—the doctor said I had had a very strong dose of poison, he could see it in my gums—he has attended me ever since, and is attending me now—I am still suffering from weakness and from my right hand; I think it will be paralysed—I had had no quarrel with my husband prior to October.</p>

He is a teetotaller and a Good Templar; he has never tried to persuade me to become so—I keep the carbonate of soda in a bottle in a cupboard—the sugar of lead is something like soda in its appearance, there is a different shade in it; it is a slight difference, the lead shines more—I don't keep any sugar of lead in the cupboard—my husband did not tell me that I might have made a mistake and put the powder in instead, I am sure of that; he told me to tell the doctor so—I left the bottle with Mrs. Podd, a friend, from the Thursday after Christ<lb/>mas till the Tuesday following, because I became so ill.</p>

From information received I went on 3rd January to the residence of General Shaw in Wood Street, Woolwich—the prisoner opened the door to me—I asked for his wife—he took me into the kitchen, where I found her—I called the prisoner to my side and asked his wife whether it was true that she was suffering from lead poison; she said yes—I said "How long has this been going on?" —she said "On the 1st November my husband gave me a glass of wine which was sent by the General; it tasted so beastly that I could not drink it—I accused my husband of putting something in it; he at first denied having put anything in, and afterwards said that he put a little bitter aloes to set me against it"—I said "Was that the first time that you tasted anything unpleasant in anything?"—she said "Yes; but I have been poorly on and off ever since October; I also found my tea unpleasant, and I pre<lb/>served a portion and handed it to Dr. Robertson"—I then told the prisoner that I should charge him with administering poison with intent</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, practising in New Road, Woolwich—on 28th December I was called to attend Mrs. Bellchambers at General Shaw's—I examined into her condition, and found that she was suffering from lead poisoning—she told me, in the prisoner's pre<lb/>sence, that she had taken the lead by mistake for carbonate of soda—I asked her how—she said, "In tea"—I gave some directions as to treatment—I saw her again next day, and from the symptoms I should say that she had been taking it for a long time—there was a large deposit of lead in the gums, round the edges of the teeth—the symptoms of lead poison<lb/>ing are very marked when it has been taken some time—paralysis is a common result of it—Mrs. Bellchambers is suffering from partial paralysis of the flexures of the right forearm—I received a powder from Mrs. Bellchambers's sister, and a bottle containing liquid—I tested the powder in the presence of Inspector Ford, and found it to be lead; I obtained a globule of metallic lead from a small portion of it, and from the smell and other things I came to the conclusion that it was acetate of lead, that is sugar of lead—Mrs. Bellchambers is still under treatment, and is likely to be so for six weeks or two months.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Sugar of lead would not necessarily produce sickness, it might do so—I have frequently given it for hemorrhage, without pro<lb/>ducing sickness; if given in large quantities it might cause vomiting, not dysentery, it produces constipation, not one dose, a number of doses—I asked Mrs. Bellchambers a few general questions as to her symptoms, but I told more by her face; the outward symptom of taking sugar of lead would be duskiness of the skin, and internally you would find de<lb/>posit on the gums, a blue line—she has duskiness now, which I attri<lb/>bute to the lead—the other symptoms would be colic, griping and twisting pain in the bowels and limbs, which she has.</p>

                  </hi>. I am professor of chemistry at Guy's Hospital—I re<lb/>ceived this bottle from Inspector Ford, it contained 2¼ oz. of a liquid which I submitted to analysis, and found 4 grains of metal in a part of the liquid—after standing for a time a sediment separated from the liquid, and a precipitate of this sediment contained nearly the entire quantity of the lead—the liquid itself contained a little lead in solution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined</hi>. Sugar of lead differs in appearance from carbonate of soda; it is sold in crystals, and carbonate of soda is sold in powder, and the weight is very different—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) found in the prisoner's</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>. In a hot place it would take two days to produce this appearance, it depends upon the atmosphere; if the air is dry and warm, very soon, if moist and in solution it might keep for six months or a year—carbonate of soda is usually sold as a white powder, and it is whiter than this, still a mistake might be made; not looking, you might mistake one for the other.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a baker, of Woolwich—on Saturday evening, 5th January, between 7 and 8 o'clock, a man came in for some buns—I did not recognise Langton at the police-court, but he stated positively that he was the man—he put down a florin and I gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—Collins came in just at the same time, and asked for a pennyworth of cake—I said that they were 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and we did not cut them—he took two buns from the window and put down a penny—I immediately examined the florin given me by Langton, and it was bad—I stepped round the counter as quick as possible, but they were both gone—I gave the florin to Davis.</p>

The principle upon which Jack purposed was this. The man Jim who escaped to push them off, Jack to supply him as he succeeded in passing them off, and me to supply him; Jack to have one ready to pass to Jim until they had run out, then to take the train back to London with return ticket, which me and Jack had provided ourselves with. Jim only having taken single ticket would return alone in consequence of being the most conspicuous. My fellow-prisoner pro<lb/>cured the counterfeit florins the night previous, about 9 p. m., somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kent Street. He said he could get any quan<lb/>tity of them, but they were only to be got at night. Me and Jim accom<lb/>panied him as far as a court leading from Kent Street to Great Dover Street, where we waited until he obtained them, I then having to carry them home to our lodgings at 21, Greville Street, all three of us lodging at the same lodgings and slept in the same room for about 12 or 14 days. This state<lb/>ment is made by me voluntarily and at my own request, and without any inducement from any person whatever.—Stephen Langton."</p>

               <p>I was told by the postman I concluded that it was George Costin that must have been there, from the description he gave me—at 1.30 I, with Detective Barry, saw the two Costins speaking to each other on Deptford Bridge—we walked up to them, and before we got to them George walked away—I said to Barry "Follow him, and bring him back"—I said to Hugh "What is the matter with your hand," seeing it bound up—he said "I jammed it two or three days ago in the docks''—I said "What have you got on it?"—he said "Nothing but a bit of rag"—I said "It appears not to have had proper treatment, let me see it"—he said "Certainly"—I said "I don't want you to show it to me here, just walk on and come into the police-station," which we did, and before I had any conversation Barry brought in George Costin—I then examined his hand, and found it was injured by cut glass—I said "It couldn't have been done in the way you describe; it is evidently done by broken glass"—he said that he was attacked last night by a lot of donkey drivers—I said "You must know them"—he said "No"—I said "must make inquiries"—he then said that he was assaulted at Forest Hill—I said "You have made three statements to me, and you will probably be charged with committing a burglary last night in Granville Park"—I put the prisoners amongst others at the station, but the postman failed to identify them—he was prepared to identify a man with a white muffler on, but previous to my bringing the men into the yard George took off his white muffler—George said "You see I am not identified"—I then took off their boots and proceeded to Granville Park, and compared them with the footprints, which corresponded—Hugh's boots were very pecu<lb/>Iiar, and the marks were very distinct, but George's were not so much so—I returned and told them they would be charged with committing the bur<lb/>glary—I commenced to search them, and in Hugh's jacket pocket I found two or three tablespoonfuls of cake crumbs—a cake had been stolen from Mr. Fuller's—on George I found a quantity of bird-seed and dirt, which was compared with that found, and corresponded—I then asked each of the Costins to account for their time the previous night—Hugh said he was at a public-house at Greenwich until 12.30, and after that at his father's, Trafalgar Road—I found that statement to be false on proceed<lb/>ing to 29, High Street, Deptford, where I ascertained Hugh lived, as also Chapman—I told her Hugh was in custody, and asked if there was anything in the room which didn't belong to her, and she said "No<lb/>thing"—on searching I found the stand broken up, which has been pro<lb/>duced, and four meted labels, and some calico in a box close by—she said "Yes, I knew it was there"—this was 8 o'clock at night—I took her to the station and charged her—from statements made by Hugh I directed Woodley to be taken to the station on the Wednesday—I then told him he would be charged with being concerned in the burglary, and he said that he knew nothing of it—I took his boots off and compared them with the footprints at 81, Granville Park, and they exactly corresponded—when I told Hugh he would be charged, George said "Don't put me along with him, I am his brother; I am not responsible for anything he has done; I wouldn't be seen with him anywhere; we are not friendly."</p>

I live at 5, Sexton Buildings, Greenwich, and am unfortunate—I have been living with Woodley for 9 or 10 months till the day he was taken—he was in on 31st December till night, and George Costin came about 8 o'clock, and I believe Woodley went out about 9—I heard no conversation between them—George stayed about a quarter of an hour—I went out about 9, and left Woodley sitting by the fire—I went back about 10, when there was nobody in—I met Woodley over at the Mitre at closing time, and he and me had had a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> on the Saturday, and I wouldn't go home with him—when I went back Woodley was there—I saw somebody standing at the top of the court, but I cannot say who it was—I didn't stay all night, I went over to my brother's and went home the next morning—I saw him again about 3 o'clock next day—I had only seen George there once before.</p>

                  </hi>. I was acting House Surgeon at Guy's Hospital on Christmas Eve when the prisoner was brought in—I examined him after he was in bed, and found he had a clean-cut, incised wound, I should say about one or two inches long, just above the left groin, and there was about two or three inches of <hi rend="italic">omentum</hi> hanging out—those were all the injuries I saw—that portion of the <hi rend="italic">omentum</hi> was ligatured and removed, and the patient was put to bed—he remained in the hospital till 19th January, I believe—only the lining of the intestines was cut—the gut itself was not injured—I should think the wound must have been produced by some kind of knife, as it was a clean-cut wound.</p>

He said, 'That heifer you spoke to'. He raised his foot to kick the dog. I told him not. I took up the dog and turned back into my mother's room, when he ran up the stairs after me. My mother put her back to the door to prevent him coming in. He bursted the door open and seized my mother by her hair and began thumping into her. I got hold of the poker and struck him across the hand to loose his hand out of my mother's hair. Mrs. Donohue was in the room at the same time. She called out for help. Joseph Reardon then came into the room."</p>

                  </hi> I am accountant to Messrs. Bevington and Sons, of the Neckinger Mills, Southwark—I have been so ten years—Peters was clerk and salesman—his duty was to sell goods to customers and enter them in the day book with the quantity and quality—it was his duty to prepare an invoice and hand it to the delivery clerk, who would have a delivery note made out for it, which would be put into an envelope, and deliver it to the carman with the goods—the customer would be required to sign it when the goods were delivered—there is a weigh-bridge at the entrance of the premises over which all goods sold by weight have to go before they go off the premises—it is necessary for the carman to have a pass note made out by one of the junior clerks—he would get it from the delivery clerk, and the particulars would come from the receipt note—the goods here are skivers, 12 qualities in all—when skivers come from the mills to the warehouse, Peters and the warehouseman have to decide as to the quality to which they are to be put—they range from a high to a low price—after they are sorted they are kept in a warehouse—the prices vary from 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 45<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—if a customer came to purchase skins, he would see Peters or Barrett—samples would be shown him, and when he had decided on a purchase, an entry would be made in the counter book, which is supposed to be kept by Barrett, specifying the quantity and quality of the skins, the lot from which they were taken, and the name of the customer—they would go from the counter book into the day book, which was kept by Peters, and the invoices should be made out by the day book and then the receipt note, and the pass would be made out, and the day book would go into the counting-house and be posted in the regular way—the previous stock-taking was on July 1, 1877, and was made by Peters and Barrett—Peters gave the stock by name and I had to post it—it appeared to be correct—early in November I took stock myself, and taking what Peters had told me iu July, I found a deficiency of about 760 dozens of skivers and 80 dozens of roans—I communicated with Peters that I was going to take stock—this was an unusual stock-taking—we only take stock every midsummer—Olpin was allowed 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month credit, and on examining his account found it was overdrawn—Olpin was a shaver, that is a man who makes skivers—I knew him in the service, but do not know him personally—on Tuesday, 7th November, he came to the mills and said that he had called to see Mr. Samuel Bevington, and asked why he was stopped having goods—I said "For a man in your position the account is very good, especially as the firm have arranged 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month"—he said "I do not owe you more than 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said "You certainly do; I am given to understand from Peters that the account is</p>

               <p>above 120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—he said "Oh, it is admitted I have not had the goods"—I sent a telegram to the office in St. Thomas's Street—Olpin remained, and when I got the answer I told him that the amount standing to his debit was 208<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said "Oh, I have not had the goods, come round with me and I will show you the invoices"—I went out with him and went into a barber's shop with him on the way, and Peters came in there, and on leaving I suggested to Peters that he had better go back to the mills; he touched Olpin on the shoulder and drew him aside—they went 30 or 40 yards from me and were talking two or three minutes—Olpin then returned, and said that Peters said to him "Don't let <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi> see the invoices" (I am <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>), and that he said to Peters "That game won't suit me"—I went with Olpin to his house in Blue Anchor Road—he produced this file of invoices—I have cast up the amount of them since, and if the amounts represented in them are true, Olpin would owe the firm 38<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I asked him to let me have them to compare with the ledger—22 of them are in Peters' writing, and the others in Barber, the junior clerk's—I left Olpin's house and went with him to the Star public-house, where the landlord showed me two cheques, one for 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and one for 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and after I left Olpin showed me more cheques—I then went to St. Thomas's Street and made a report to Mr. Bevington, and on the same day, about 5.30, I again went to the Star and found the prisoners there, and heard Olpin say to Peters "If you have done wrong why to hell don't you go to the governor and make a clean breast of it?"—Peters then asked me to see him privately—I went into a private room with him, and he threw himself on a seat and said "Ah, <hi rend="italic">Jim</hi>, it is all over now"—I said "If you have done wrong, you had better go to the governor and explain the matter and make a clean breast of it"—he said "I cannot face them, I will write"—this letter is in Peters's writing.</p>

I am one of the principals of this firm—this letter is addressed to the firm—I saw Peters at his house, and had a conversation with him—I had had a long search for him, as father was apprehensive that he would commit suicide—I found him at his house in a depressed state of mind, and under a promise of leniency he made a statement to me, but not a full confession—the letter had been written before I entered the house, and was lying before him—I had not seen him before I went there, or given him a promise of leniency or in<lb/>timated that he would be reinstated—I took the letter up and put it in my pocket with his consent—that was after I had made him a promise of leniency—I had had about a quarter of an hour's conversation with him before that.</p>

               <p>am very sorry to inform you that I have been false to you in respect to Olpen's account. The way it has occurred is this: five years ago he began dealing with you, with my father, and about a year ago open an account. The way the accounts have been falsified is this: when Olpen has come in to buy I have made out the invoice and sent it with carman, or given it him, and entered it afterwards different in price in the day book. I never took money from Olpen on your account without paying it in. I have no excuse to offer. I can only say that I am very sorry and ashamed to have abuse your confidence in this manner. I write this now, as my head is so bad, not be able to see you in the morning. Respecting the stock was not correct when it was given under my charge, and was very short when I had it. I leave the rest in your hands to do what you will, us I am entirely to blame."</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>). At the close of my conversation with Peters he asked me to go back to the Mills and fetch his overcoat, and when I got there I made a communication to Mr. Bevington, who went out and came back with the coat—Peters afterwards came out with Olpin, saying "Here comes Mr. Samuel Bevington, I'm off"—I called at Peters's house several times after that; I called on the 28th and he handed me these invoices, marked C 1 to 23, and said that he could swear Olpin had had the goods mentioned in them with the exception of two of them—I have compared them and they agree with the day book kept by Peters—I finished stock-taking on 30th November, saw Peters again, and mentioned the deficiency I found—I told him the same as I have told you to-day—he replied that there were about 200 dozen short stock-taking, but he could not account for the rest—he came to the warehouse the next day and looked over the stock, but did not account for the deficiency—I remember 76 dozen of high-limed skins being put into stock after the stock-taking in July, and I could not find any trace of them when I went through the stock in November—I told Peters I could not find them—he said that they had gone to Olpin, and that he had passed an invoice in the name of A. D. Poppleton for five dozen high-limed skivers, for which I have written off the skins that have gone to Olpin at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a dozen—he has entered them to Poppleton at 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and I do not know whether 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be their fair value—Mr. S. Bevington and Peters had priced them, they always did so—this is the assortment book, in which I make up the assortments from information given by Peters—I find here at folio 99 that he told me to price these skins at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., which he told me had sent to Olpin at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and debited them to Poppleton, but that the 56 dozen had not come into stock—I have looked through the books, but find no trace of a sale to Poppleton of 76 dozen high-limed skins in Olpin's writing—I have examined the day book and ledger, and the receipt notes and the pass notes, but the counter book has not been posted—it was Barrett's duty to keep that—I find in the stock book an entry in Peter's writing of 99 dozen skivers being in the possession of Whithard and Crisp—they are bracketed with 664 others, that is to make a total quan<lb/>tity in stock—"W. C. and Co." is against these—they got into Messrs. Bevington's hands, because they were to be sold on commission.</p>

The terms upon which we dealt with Olpin were a monthly credit, less 2 1/2 discount—goods supplied in one month were to be paid the following month—the ledger clerk would make out the monthly accounts—it was not Peters's duty—if Peters sold goods he would enter the sale in the day book, and that would find its way into the ledger—if the entry in the day book was made at a fraudulent price it would appear as a correct entry in the ledger, and would appear in these statements, and be paid for by the customer—but he would only pay the fraudulent price that was in the day book—the July statement is in Peters's writing—in the ledger Olpin's account appears under consecutive dates, but not in the statements, so that they cannot have been copied from the ledger—it was no part of Peters's duty to render these monthly state<lb/>ments—there is no entry in the statement of 11th July—I never took stock myself till November, and that was by the special direction of Messrs. Bevington—Peters and the under-warehouseman Barrett took stock, that is they counted the stock on hand, and Mr. Samuel Beving<lb/>ton initialled it—he would take it on trust from the warehouseman—Peters always told me whether the stock was correct or not—on 1st July I found there was a large deficiency—I can't say for how long it may have been wrong.</p>

                  </hi>. I am under-warehouseman to Messrs. Bevington, at Neckinger Mills—Peters was the warehouseman, and his father before him—it was part of my duty to assist Peters in assorting the skins, show<lb/>ing goods to customers, and delivering to the carmen—I had nothing to do with making entries in the day book, that was Peters's duty—he and Mr. Samuel Bevington fixed the prices at which goods should be sold; I had nothing to do with that—I had a counter book in which I entered the skins that went out of the warehouse—I did not always have that book—I asked for it, the firm did not ask me to keep it—Peters used to ask me for it, and once he kept it for about six months—during that six months it was not made up; I never saw it—when I got it back again Peters told me to make it up from the day book; I did so—when I had not the counter-book I made entries in this pocket-book (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I made the entries by Peters's direction—this shows the quality or class of goods that went out since January—I made the entries either that day or the next—I had no counter book then—I received directions from Peters as to the class of goods that were to be delivered to Olpin—I recollect the stock being taken in July—I counted the skins in the bundles—I had a man to help me—I gave the numbers to Peters—I asked him</p>

               <p>how the stock came out—he said a few short—I asked him how it was that they were short—he said he had got some at the back of the book to be entered, and that would make them right—the night before he left he told me not to expect to see him any more—I asked why—he said because he might be 100 miles away to-morrow—I have been shown this exhibit marked "I"—the extracts are correct from the pocket-book.</p>

I have been under Peters's orders between six and seven years—I have assisted in every stock-taking during all that time—it will sometimes take a month to take stock at Neckinger Mills—it would usually take two men to count as well as somebody to memo. down the figures—when Peters's father was there I assisted him in the stock-taking—Mr. Samuel Bevington attends to the stock-taking, ticking off the bundles and initialling them—he has before his eyes the goods that have been counted—it is a mere matter of counting—no comparison is made with the previous year—I have not heard Mr. Samuel Bevington say that he was averse to this prosecution—I have not discovered since this prosecution that a large quantity of goods had not been taken into account—there has been no discovery of any alteration in the figures—in selling, the actual skins are shown to the customer, not samples—I don't remember Mr. Samuel Bevington ever selling to Olpin—he is there almost every day and present when Peters is selling—I am not aware that Peters was allowed a discretion to sell at less than the usual price—I think he would ask permission first—he might ask what he liked provided it was above the standard—if skins are found to be faulty the price is reduced—the majority of the skins sold to Olpin were what are called broken or faulty—I have often been with the carman to Olpin's to deliver goods—I never delivered a bundle more to the carman than I was ordered to do, nor has more been delivered at Olpin's than I had orders for.

                  </hi>. I live at 28, Aspinall Road, and was clerk to the late Mr. Roberts, a leatherdresser—I have bought goods from time to time of Olpin, averaging from 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and have receipts for the pay<lb/>ments—I am the Mr. Kaisey to whom this letter is addressed—I handed it over to the other side—it was obvious that Mr. Bevington wanted me to give such information as I could, and I was unwilling, because I had known Olpin many years.</p>

I think Mr. Foster called on me three times before he sent the letter, and saw me the third time when he brought the letter—I have known Olpin twenty-five years, he has borne an irre<lb/>proachable character—he came round with the letter and summons and took me to the police-court straight—Olpin has been in the habit of coming to my master's three years—the skins he sold were all inferior, from 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. up to 21<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., none better—he never had any good ones—the highly-limed skins are inferior.</p>

I paid 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for, and afterwards got them reduced to 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Olpin gave me an intimation that if I made any reduction, he could not supply them, because he only got 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of them—I saw Bevington's carman deliver them every week.</p>
