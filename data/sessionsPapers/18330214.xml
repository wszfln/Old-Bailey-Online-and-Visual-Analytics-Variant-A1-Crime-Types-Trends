On Sunday, the 20th of January, I was very unwell the whole day; I never stirred out from the Saturday till Monday - I went to bed before nine o'clock, being unwell; I had the care of the warehouse - Joshua went to bed with me, about nine o'clock, and I am pretty well certain he was in bed with me the whole night; I have no doubt of it, for being unwell I was awake most of the night - in the course of the Sunday I had occasion to go into the warehouse three or four times; it was quite safe - the drawers in the warehouse were secured with a bar across them, which was padlocked - I had seen them quite safe on Saturday night; the drawers were barred and locked, and the key of the drawers was in possession of a person not in the house; I locked the warehouse door between seven and eight o'clock, and put the key of the warehouse under my pillow; all was safe then - I got up next morning about a quarter before eight o'clock, and when I came down stairs I found a dark-lantern at the foot of the stairs, within a few inches of the counting-house door, that alarmed me - I then observed a stool in the passage, which belonged to the warehouse, and two small pieces of clean writing paper, and two worsted socks; I took them up, and immediately went to the warehouse - the socks were two odd ones; I gave them to Waller, the officer - the two pieces of paper were at the foot of the stool; I went to the warehouse, and found the counting-house door a little way open, but the key was safe in my breeches pocket, as I had put it the night before - I am quite certain I had locked it; that was the warehouse key, but it goes into both counting-house and warehouse - that is the door which secures all the property; I am perfectly certain I locked it overnight - I have been there fifteen years; on going into the warehouse I found the floor strewed with empty drawers - they were the drawers where the principal gold and silver articles were kept, and which were safe overnight, having a bar across them, and padlocked; they were all empty on Monday morning - I saw that the bar was not in its proper place, and that day or next, I saw a piece of wood sticking to it, with the marks of a centre-bit; I looked round, and found from fifteen to twenty skeleton-keys, a centre-stock, four or six bits, for making circular holes, a pair of gloves. two oranges half sucked away, a bottle of oil, a match-box, a bank of whipcord, a crow-bar, a tinman's soldering iron, a chisel, and one or two straps, apparently of a pair of trousers; these things remained in the warehouse, and in my fright I instantly ran off for Mr. Wheeler, who lives at Camden-town - he seldom missed coming to town every day; I remember finding a tin box on my son Joshua about a week before - this is the box(looking at it) - I have no doubt; but it then had a lid to it; I was searching in his pockets for a key I had lost; I did not find the key, but found this, and he immediately snatched it from me, and ran out of the house - it had a lid to it, but what was in it I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. After this, and before the Sunday night, did you at any time see this tin article, in this condition, in your house (producing the lid of a tin box, with two wheels attached to it?) A. I did, but cannot exactly say whether it was before or after - I saw my little boy dragging it about, but it did not occur to me at the time that it was the same; (looking at it) I am the more strongly convinced of it being the same now, for I remember its being painted; while I was gone for Mr. Wheeler the officers were sent for, and I delivered to Waller the different articles found on the floor; here are the picklocks, crowbar, phosphorus-box, socks, matches, and other things - the picklock-keys were spread about the floor, and here is a knife I forgot to mention - it had been recently sharpened.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. I presume you have no share in the business? A. No, I am merely the clerk; Mr. Wheeler has no partner at all - he pays for the dwelling-house; I live there as his clerk; my son staid at home with me the greatest part of the Sunday; he was out two or three times for an hour or an hour and a half each time - he has just left school, and has not been put to any business yet; he may have left school six or eight months - I have been endeavouring to get him to sea; my wife had gone to Cross-street, Hatton-garden - I did not see her return that night, but she came in after I went to bed; I did not hear her come in, nor did I hear any body come in that night - I was pretty sound asleep for the first two or three hours.</p>

               <p>Q. If you were sound asleep, your son might have got out for an hour or two without your knowledge? A. He might; I came down in the morning, without being alarmed, and found things as I have described.</p>
               <p>Q. If the door was fastened and bolted inside, how could a person get in? A. I do not think there was any way, for there had been an attempt at robbery a few 
years before, and the house was perfectly well fastened.</p>


               <p>Q. There must have been somebody to withdraw the bolts? A. Undoubtedly; a short person would require a stool to reach it - I found all the things scattered about in different parts of the warehouse; my son was in the employ of Mr. Boyd, a jeweller, of No. 312, Oxford-street, for three or four months; that was the second place he had - before that he lived with Mr. Statham, a great tailor in Bedford-street, Covent-garden, and with an apothecary in Tavistock-street; this is since he left school; I was looking for a berth at sea for him, and during that time he lived with those people - it did not strike me to mention this; he was not more than a fortnight with Statham, and rather less with the apothecary, and with Boyd four months - I did not think that worth mentioning; he left the apothecary and tailor in credit; he left Boyd, I believe, because he had three shops, and gave up two of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the real cause? A. Why the boy had stolen a knife - I cannot call it stealing; he had given it to be ground - he would have left the place in a week if it had not been for that; that accelerated his being discharged; I never saw the knife in his possession - I know he robbed Mr. Wheeler of 3s. 6d.; Mr. Wheeler found it out, and I returned it to him - I never heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140005"/>that it was marked money put into the till on purpose; I understand some waste-paper was stolen while my son was in the house; it was books belonging to the late partnership, and was sold as waste-paper, and the prisoner Smith took it, with my son's consent, as I have heard - it was found at a cheesemonger's; I taxed my son with it, and he owned to it - he stole a shilling from somebody whom I do not know, and cannot tell when it was - I know of nothing else; I wanted to get him to sea for that very reason.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. He was a very bad boy, I believe? A. I have related all I know of his badness; I cannot tell when the bolts were drawn - I know it must have been after eight o'clock; my son was acquainted with Smith when these wicked acts occurred; he has drank tea at our house full half a dozen times - my son was out three times on Sunday, and he was out about seven or eight o'clock for an hour; I cannot say how long he staid to half an hour - he was in the habit of going out with Smith repeatedly; I have seen Smith at the house six or eight times.</p>

             was my clerk and book-keeper. On Monday morning, the 21st of January, I arrived from my house in Camden-town, between nine and ten o'clock - my attention was excited by the unusual appearance of the door not being open, and the shutters of the warehouse were shut; they ought to have been open - (I pay the rent of the house and the rates; it is in the parish of St. Andrew, Holborn) - I was at the warehouse late on Saturday evening- my stock in the drawers was all perfectly safe on my leaving on Saturday, at near ten o'clock or later - when I entered on Monday morning I found my clerks assembled in the passage, who asked if I had seen Mr. James, but I had not seen him - I immediately went into the warehouse; my attention was drawn to the drawers strewed on the floor, and a variety of keys strewed on the counters, and various other implements: this lantern and other articles of housebreaking, which did not belong to my house - the value of the stock I lost I cannot state within some hundreds of pounds; but I lost decidedly considerably beyond 500l. worth of goods - I cannot speak with accuracy within some hundreds; among other articles which I deal in, is a waxer; I had several of them in my house on Saturday night - I have now brought one from my own stock; here is the die which the top of the waxer I have brought was stamped with; it is the die which made the impression on the silver - the die is made for the purpose of making one of a larger size as well; it has two borders - the waxer produced is made to the reduced size; you will also find that there is a screw for the purpose of screwing into this tube - on trying that through the guage plate, you will find it fits No. 10; this is not one of the articles stolen, and here is a die my bodkins are made with - here is a lead impression made from it, and here is a similar indented impression in the die - it is for the purpose of showing us where to make the hole.</p>
               <p>DANIEL FORRESTER. I produce two bodkins, one of which I picked up in the house, No. 47, Red Lion-street, Clerkenwell, and the others I received from Mr. Cope in the same house, on the 28th of January - the one I found was among some things in the front room; it was a week after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. ADOLPHUS. Q. Was any body at home in the house? A. No; the prisoners were both in custody - they were taken on the 22nd; I found the bodkin among some things which had been turned out of some drawers - I had turned several of the things out the first time I went, which was on the 22nd, about nine o'clock in the evening.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. On the 28th, when you examined more particularly among those things, you found a bodkin? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>MR. WHEELER. These are silver bodkins; when they were first produced, they exhibited an appearance of being new - they had the bloom of newness on them, evidently showing to me that they had not been used; if they had been exposed in a place where the air was damp, there would be a tarnish on them - to the best of my belief, this bodkin which I now hold in my hand is my manufactury and was made in this die; the bead in it exactly corresponds with the hole made in it - there is the piercing of it in the place where the indentation is made to guide my men where to pierce it; I cannot speak to the second bodkin with the same confidence, because the die from which it has been made has been much more used, and is very old - it is similar to those I manufacture, and it fits the die - it had the same degree of comparative newness when produced to me.</p>

            . I am one of the City marshals. I have a waxer, which I found in the front parlour, at No. 47, Red Lion-street; the prisoners were apprehended on the 22nd, and it was four or five days after that - the drawers had been examined and emptied on the night of the 22nd, by me and Forrester, but on making a more minute examination afterwards, I found this waxer and a bodkin; I delivered the bodkin to Forrester.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How was the house left between the 22nd and the 28th? A. We got in on the 22nd, between nine and ten o'clock at night - we left nobody in the house when we came out; there were no keys.</p>
               <p>Q. If any body was disposed to make evidence, they could have deposited these things there. A. I think not, for I recollect on the first night, on turning over the things, seeing the two bodkins and this piece of was; I was not aware that such things had been lost, not having read the bill minutely - I turned the things out of a kind of workbox.</p>
               <p>MR. WHEELER. This waxer bore every appearance of being new, and I have every reason to believe it was once my property; I tried it in the die, and have no doubt whatever that this was struck in that die - here is the die; it fits exactly - I have no doubt these two ends of the waxer are made in the same die.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long has the die for the waxers been in your possession? A. I cannot say; I have been a manufacturer thirty-three years<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140006"/>- the die has been in my possession some years; a great many of these things have been made and sold to different people - I sell to the trade; I had not many waxers in my possession at the time of the robbery - I might have from a dozen to twenty - they were kept in the warehouse; I have made a great many bodkins - they are a common pattern; the eye and slit would be about the same position nearly in all the bodkins which are made - there would be a little variation in the end nob, as generally speaking they are made rounder; Joshua James could not have access to these things, for the drawers were always locked up, and the keys kept by my respective clerks - I cannot conceive any time at which he might have got at them; I saw some waste-paper which was said to have been brought from a shop in Clare-market, and questioned him about it - he said he had taken it together with another, who carried it out of the warehouse; this was before the robbery - on discovering this robbery, I occupied myself the whole of Monday taking the examinations of every body in the house; I asked Mr. James about it - I told him it must be a gross act of negligence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not give him a hint that he would leave your service in consequence of it? A. He had a hint previous to that - the son gave me information on the following morning, and I sent the Police to Red Lion-street; I was there once when they searched, and saw the bodkins and the wax, but they were not brought away, because I brought away nothing - on picking up the waxer, I recognized it at once; I said "This is decidedly my property"- I brought nothing away; Joshua was not in my service; I never personally detected him in robbing me - one of my clerks stated some money was found on him; it was not produced to me that I recollect - that was full two or three years ago; I only knew of the paper being stolen since this robbery - I knew nothing of any ear-rings.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. I believe you have every reason to believe he was a very bad boy? A. Very great reason- I can safely say that at least every one of the articles stated in the indictment was gone from my stock; they are stated less in number and value than what I lost - Joshua and his father were kept separate in my house after I came on the Monday,</p>
               <p>WILLIAM WADHAM COPE re-examined. I was sent for to Mr. Wheeler's - I arrived between four and five o'clock on Tuesday afternoon, the 22nd;

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. That cord is common enough? A. I should think it is, and the oil also - I did not find every thing which I expected - I examined the back bed-room minutely, as far as I could.</p>

In my judgment this wheel has been part of this piece - they correspond exactly except the round part being away; it corresponds in the painting, and the shading inside the figure - I found this piece of tin there; the worsted socks would prevent a noise being made by a man's shoes - here are three samples of oil, one from the prosecutor's, the other from the cup, and one from Mrs. Count's.</p>

            . I live at No. 36, Cowcross-street, and deal in oil. On Sunday evening, the 20th of January, early in the evening. Joshua James came for some oil - I should know him again; that is him (looking at him) - he asked me for 3d. worth of sperm oil, which would be about a gill - I had no sperm; I did not tell him so, but I gave him pale rape - here is a sample I have brought of it - this bottle, produced from the prosecutor's, contains the same sort of oil, and this bottle is also the same kind of oil; I sold him rather more than is in these two bottles - here is some in a cup; I do not recollect what sort of a cup he brought for it - but he brought a cup.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. This is not an uncommon oil? A. No, very common; it is cheaper than sperm - I did not tell him I was giving him an inferior article.</p>

            . I am a hosier. These socks are not in the state in which they were originally sewn - they agree in colour with the two pieces of stockings found at the house in Red Lion-street; these two pieces of white cotton appear to have been cut from the white part of the odd socks found at Wheeler's - I have not a doubt that this odd sock and the bottoms originally formed one stocking; in my judgment, the whole once formed a pair of stockings - this white piece undoubtedly belonged to this one.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You fix on one piece particularly, have you any doubt about the other? A. No, but there is something in this which particularly convinces me that this part was once united to this; I say decidedly that this once formed a complete stocking - it is not an uncommon texture of stocking.</p>

            . I was fifteen years old on the 20th of April last; I live with my father at Mr. Wheeler's. I have known the prisoner Smith about two years; I became acquainted with him by meeting him several times in the neighbourhood, and we went to the same school; in December last I was in the service of Mr. Boyd, a jeweller, in Oxford-street - I was then rather less intimate with Smith, but became more intimate with him after I left Boyd - we have talked together a good deal; I am sorry to say, I once stole 3s. 6d. from Mr. Wheeler - I do not recollect that I told Smith of that; I was in the habit of communicating privately to Smith about what I had done - I told him several things which I had done, and he told me several things that he had done, and we became very intimate; about a month before the robbery, I had some conversation with him about Mr. Wheeler - he asked me what Mr. Wheeler was worth, and if there was much property, and where it was kept; I told him - I know 47, Red Lion-street; I went there with Smith about a week after he asked me what Mr. Wheeler was worth, and where he kept his property - Smith's mother had asked me to go with him to No. 47, Red Lion-street while the lady of the house was absent, and I went with him; that was the first time I had ever been there - Mrs. Coney was the lady of the house; when I got to the house, Smith told me the house was kept by cracksmen - I asked what he meant; he said housebreakers - he then took me into the kitchen, which appeared like a cellar; he showed me a number of keys there and a life preserver which was broken (looking at a bunch of keys); I think they were larger keys than these(looks at another small bunch of keys) - there were several of these, and this is the sort of thing called a life-preserver, but I can not be certain of it, for it was broken at that time; and he showed me a number of old articles - he showed me some old drawers, and several rubbishing things; he did not that day show me any thing else that I recollect - I saw some whipcord there, but cannot say on what day, and a crow-bar; I went to the house a short time afterwards with Smith again - I have seldom gone without Smith: the second time I went I saw three more persons there, Coney was one, and when I got there (I think this was the second time), Coney asked me where Mr. Wheeler's property was kept, and what situation the warehouse drawers were in; I told him - (looking at the top of a tin box made into a cart) I know that; about a week after Coney asked me about the premises, Smith called for me at Mr. Wheeler's - I went out with him into Bartlett's-passage, and there I found Coney waiting - Smith produced a tin box to me full of soap, in Coney's presence in the passage; Smith had before that asked me to get him the impression of the counting-house key, and the iron chest key; the counting-house key opens the door leading to the warehouse - I had said I would get him the impression of only one; Coney was not present when Smith first asked me to get the impression - he was present afterwards, when he asked me about it, before I went into Bartlett's-passage- I refused to get the iron chest key - I said there was a great deal of property there, and I would not get it; Coney heard me refuse to get the impression of the chest key, and the (Coney) said I was a fool - in Bartlett's-pas<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140008"/>sage Smith gave me the box of soap out of his pocket; this tin cart was the lid of it, to the best of my knowledge - Smith gave it to me before I came up to Coney, and when I got up, Coney told me to press the key even with the soap; it did not matter which side - I was to get the flat side of the counting-house key and press it level with the soap; I was to wet the key before I pressed it to the soap, and I was to hold the key up afterwards, to see that no soap was sticking in the wards - I received these directions from both Coney and Smith in the passage; I took the box of soap, and had it in my pocket - I left them, and came home; my father was searching my pockets on the following Monday for a key, and saw the box of soap in my pocket - I had at that time got the impression on the soap; the lid was on the box - my father saw it, and tried to take it away from me, but I was quick and put it into another pocket, and I ran off to Coney's house in, Red Lion-street, and saw Coney, who was cutting wood; I told him the box had been seen - he said he hoped nothing was suspected, and while I was there he lent me a book called the Forget Me Not; this is the book, to the best of my knowledge - it had a cover exactly like this; Coney said they only wanted 20l. - my father had no opportunity of examining the impression of the key: this was at nine o'clock in the morning - I was to call again at eleven o'clock (this was the Monday before the Sunday of the robbery); I came home then, and lent the Forget Me Not to my mother - I went to Coney's again about eleven o'clock, and found Coney and two or three more men there; Smith was there - I now know a person named Cook, and another named Pearce, and there was a tall man who I do not know the name of; they were the three persons who were there; I should know them all three again - when I returned at eleven o'clock, Coney was filing a key in the vice; (looking at a vice) it was about this size, but not so rusty - the box of soap was on a window ledge by him, with the impression on it, and Pearce was making a little cart of the top of the soap box; he put this little axletree to it, and I saw him put these two wheels in, and saw him cut two other pieces to fasten the wheels to - he made the cart, tied a string to it, and told me to give it to my little brother, so that my father might see it, and be deceived, that he should not suspect any thing was in the box which he had seen; Coney and Pearce together told me that; I waited until Coney had finished the key, and after he had finished it, he put it in the fire, and then gave it to me to try if it would fit - putting it in the fire took away the brightness; I took it home, and had no opportunity of trying it until the Sunday night of the robbery - I delivered it to Smith, as I could not try it; he had it in his possession to prevent my father seeing it - he had it while I went in to dinner on Tuesday, and returned it to me again, but I had no opportunity of trying it; on the Friday before the robbery, I went to Coney's house - Coney then said, that he and another would call at Mr. Wheeler's with a job to mend, to see the situation of the premises; I was to meet him at the White Horse, Gilbert-street, Clare-market, on the Saturday afternoon - I went, and Smith with me; there was Pearce, Cook, and the tall man, and several others there, and Coney came about half an hour afterwards; I was talking with them, and when Coney came he asked me to bring the dog to Red Lion-street the next afternoon; I said several times to them on that Saturday, that they had better leave it alone, because I was afraid my father would be suspected - Coney said they would leave all their tools there, to wipe off the suspicion from my father, and to show that it was done by the profession; on the Saturday, Cook said, if I ever split, he would muzzle me (both the prisoners were present) - Pearce said if I did not go on with it, he would scrag me, and the tall man said he would take me before a Magistrate if I did not proceed with it; I am certain both the prisoners were present then - Coney said the tall man was to watch at the kitchen door, to see that the servant did not awake; Coney wanted me to poison the dog - I said I would not, because it was a favourite dog, and one we had hed by us for many years; when I would not-poison it, he asked me to bring it to the house on Sunday; I went home on Saturday, and was to come between five and six o'clock on Sunday with the dog - I went with it between five and six o'clock, and found Coney at home, and in a little time Cook, Pearce, and the tall man came and Smith came in - they saw the dog, and one of them remarked, "Have you got the barker?" and Coney said, "We have him all right;" the dog was running about there until the men came in - Coney then told me to come with him; I went with him through a yard into a shed, and he tied the dog there with a string to a post in a shed in the yard - we then all drank tea together; after tea I was sent for 3d. of sperm oil in a tea cup - I went for it to Cow-cross; I believe Mrs. Count was the woman I went to, but I cannot be certain - this is the sort of tea cup Coney gave me to fetch the oil in; I brought it back to him, and he then put some into a dark lantern, some into a phial, and some remained in the tea cup (looking at a dark lantern) - this is the lantern; I cannot speak to the phial - Coney said "I have got some laudanum, could not you contrive to put some into the servant's and your father's beer;" he said this in the presence of all the rest - I refused, and he said, I was a great fool, and Mrs. Coney said I had better not; after tea, Coney brought out all the housebreaking implements - Pearce, Cook, and all were present at the time (looking at the articles produced); there was a piece of whipcord like this on the table - I think this is the piece and the bag of keys; they were shook out of the bag by Pearce, shown to me, and put in again; I looked them all over in my hand, and then they were put into the bag again - it was such a bag as that; this centrebit I certainly saw, and the stock-handle - the bits were in this corderoy case, as they are now; a little before that, Coney was mending a pair of worsted socks - I asked him what they were for - he said they were to put on over his shoes, to prevent his making any noise - this is one of the socks, and the other was like this - they were odd ones; I saw them at the examination - they are the same as I had seen at Coney's, to the best of my knowledge; there were four or five oranges on the table, one of which was given to me, and I eat it; I asked what they were going to take the oranges with them for - they said they had got bad coughs - after tea on Sunday, Coney said he had been to Mr. Wheeler's, and seen a young man, and he asked me what was in the drawers in the chest opposite, and I told him all the silver; he said he had been to Wheeler's with a pin, to get a diamond put in, and the young man told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140009"/>him they did not do such jobs for strangers, and there was plenty of shops in Holborn if he would go to them - he said the drawers were opposite just by the window; those are the drawers which are fastened by a bar and padlock - I left them on Sunday evening, about half-past six o'clock; I had the key with me then, and they told me to be sure and try it, and give it to them at the Magpie and Stump, Fetter-lane - I had not before that had an opportunity of trying the key; I went home and left Smith with them - when I got home my father was in the drawing-room; I went into the room - it was agreed that I should leave the door ajar, and return to them at the Magpie and Stump, and give them the key if it fitted, and that was to be a signal that I had left the door open; there is a fan-light over the door, and they were to put a piece of paper on the fan-light, as a signal for Pearce that they were ready to come out - Pearce was to be outside, Coney and Cook were to be in the warehouse, and the tall man, at the kitchen stairs; Smith was one of the party on the Sunday evening, and I asked him if he should be at the house with them; he said No, he would not, and he would never sell his liberty for such a thing as that - I tried the key while my father was up stairs in the drawing-room; it fitted - I was to meet them at the Magpie and Stump between eight and nine o'clock, and went there; I left the door ajar, as I had agreed - I was to deliver the key to one of them at the tap-room in Fetter-lane, as a signal that the door was ajar, but I found the tall man at the door of the Magpie and Stump; I gave it to him, and he said "We can't find George," meaning Coney - Coney came running up directly, and whispered to him; I then walked down Bartlett's-buildings, and saw Coney and another man (I cannot say whether it was Cook or not) dodge round the bricks to go in at the door; Coney was nearest the lamp and I saw his face - they went in before me; they were to hide themselves behind the counter in the warehouse till I was in bed - I went home directly and found the door open, and shut it; while I was at Coney's on the Sunday, I asked what the whipcord was for, and they said it would be useful, and I saw Pearce sharpening his knife - I asked the use of every thing; he was sharpening his knife on a new whetstone - I believe this is the knife; the life-preserver was on the table - I saw Coney at one end of the room, tying something, but I could not tell what, and just before I left I saw the life-preserver laying on the table, mended in the state it is now; Smith had it in his hand, and struck me with it several times in play, and said it would hit any body a good crack - I went to bed about nine o'clock, and after I was in bed I heard a ring at the bell, and a knock, and heard a man's voice; I do not know the watchman's voice - I had been in bed I should think three quarters of an hour, or an hour - I had not gone to sleep; shortly after that I heard footsteps running up the stairs, and the person that ran up tried one of the doors - he made a noise in running up - it appeared a man's footstep; I returned the Forget Me Not to Coney a few days before the robbery; I gave it into his own hands - I did not see the dog next morning till about twelve o'clock; I remember Mr. Wheeler's making inquiry on the Monday about this, and again on the Tuesday, and I made a statement to him, and afterwards saw Forrester and Cope - I disclosed to them what I knew, and where Coney lived; I afterwards accompanied them to where he lived, and to the public-house in Clare-market, where he was apprehended, and then went with them to No. 47, Red Lion-street.</p>

             re-examined. I went to a house in Great Mitchell-street with Smith; I waited outside while he went in; it was before the robbery - I have been there with him several times, and he told me the property was to be taken there - it is at the corner of Brick-lane, and a grocer's shop; the last time I went there with Smith, he said, "Mr. Wheeler little thinks that some of his prime stuff is coming here."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Is it for fear you have not done mischief enough to Smith that you add that, without being asked? A. No; Smith is fifteen years old - I should not have done this, if I had not been frightened at being muzzled or scragged - I was afraid of their threatening; I was not so much afraid at the beginning as at last - I never was with them in any robbery, not with Coney; I am sorry to say I have committed a robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you tell us how long it is since you began? A. I do not know - it is about three years ago.</p>
               <p>Q. I should not be surprised if you do not say it was Smith brought you into all the robberies? A. He did into this; I have done wrong things three years ago, and have been robbing at different times - I once took 1s. from my father; I stole it - I have taken some books from him, and have taken halfpence several times; I do not remember taking any thing particular of my mother's; I have stolen things from her three or four times, but do not remember what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it because you repented of this that you told? A. It was, Sir, I assure you; I was afraid something would happen to me if I did not tell - it was through fear and repentance both; I was afraid of being taken up - I have been in the infirmary at the Compter ever since this.</p>
               <p>Q. You have said a great many things here which you did not state at the Mansion-house? A. I was not questioned so much then; I was sworn to tell the whole truth; what I said was taken down in writing - I do not remember whether I said there, that Smith kept the key to prevent my father seeing it; I do not think I did - nobody has refreshed my memory in the prison; I have seen Mr. Wheeler there, and my father and mother - I did not state at the Mansion-house about leaving their tools there to show it had been done by the profession - that is the expression they used; I forgot to state it - I did not say that Cook said he would muzzle me, because I was not asked, nor that the tall man was to stop at the kitchen door, but Mr. Wheeler has all that in writing - I did not mention their asking me to poison the dog, nor about the barker, nor about Coney mending the socks, that I recollect; I was not so long at the Mansion-house as I have been here - I was about a quarter of an hour being examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it not at least two hours? A. I do not remember how long it was - when my father found the soap-box he was searching for a little key; he asked me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140010"/>for it; I said I knew nothing about it - I was not so intimate with Smith while at Boyd's as I was afterwards; he never came to see me there - I stole a knife from Boyd once, and some halfpence several times; I do not recollect any thing else that I did there - I pledged my own watch while there; my father had given it to me - I do not think I pawned any thing belonging to the family; I will not swear I did or did not, for I do not remember - I pawned my watch at Mr. Cotterel's, in Oxford-street; I pawned several of my own books in Gray's Inn-lane - I swear I did not pawn any of Mr. Boyd's books there, nor of any of the family; I never pawned any thing belonging to the family - I had several of his young man's books, and pawned them; I had bought them of his young man; I had exchanged with him - I got the money from my father to buy them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you pawn any which you had neither bought nor exchanged? A. Not to my knowledge, I do not remember - I have sold some of my father's books; I do not remember pawning Mr. Boyd's young man's books opposite Gray's Inn-lane; I cannot swear I did not - I do not remember doing any thing else wrong in Mr. Boyd's service; I might have taken a penny or so, but cannot remember - there was a printed circular came; I opened it, as I found it was printed - Mr. Boyd found it in my pocket very soon after; I should have given it to him, or laid it on the counter for him - he searched my pockets before I went away, and found it; he turned me away for quarrelling with the young man, not for stealing - I had one of his young man's books which I had bought of him; I remember I did pawn one which did not belong to me, that was the Mirror - I forgot that before; I pawned the Casket - I took 3s. 6d. from Mr. Wheeler, and 1s. before, and I robbed him of some medals, that is all to my knowledge - I robbed him of some paper, and sold it at 3d. a lb. by Smith's persuasion; Smith did not persuade me to the other robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever rob him of any ear-rings? A. If you will give me time I will tell you the truth; I have not robbed Mr. Wheeler of ear-rings - I do not think I robbed any body of ear-rings; I cannot remember every thing - I do not remember the ear-rings; if I did steal them I would own it directly - I might have stolen them, but do not remember; I have lived at Mr. Statham's, a tailor, Mr. Foot, a surgeon, and Mr. Boyd - I left Mr. Foot because I did not like the place; I took nothing from there, nor at any place except Wheeler's and Boyd's - I never picked a pocket in Smithfield; I left the prosecutor's door open for the party to go in.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any idea who 
               <persName id="t18330214-1-person127">drew</persName>
             the bolt inside? A. No, nor who put the stool by the door - there was no other boy in the house but my little brother, who is seven or eight years old; he slept with his mother - I can reach the bolt without a stool; Mr. Wheeler did not threaten to send me to gaol before I told of this - he advised me to make a confession: I suppose he suspected me by my being had before - I refused the impression of the key of the iron chest; they asked what was in the drawers - I said silver goods.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. You was intimate with Smith, and told him from time to time what had been done? A. Yes; I do not recollect telling him I had taken 3s. 6d. from Mr. Wheeler.</p>

            . I am warehouseman to the prosecutor. On the Monday morning after the robbery, about eleven o'clock, I was called from the kitchen, went into the passage, and saw the prisoner Smith- I asked him what his business was; he said he wished to see Josh, by which name Joshua James goes - I asked what he wanted to see him for; he said he had an appointment to go with him to look after a situation; I asked him when he saw Josh last - he said Saturday afternoon; on the following morning Smith was examined by Mr. Wheeler, and I heard him tell Mr. Wheeler that he had met Josh on the Sunday, near the pump in Aylesbury-street; I think he said it was between four and five o'clock - I reminded him that on the previous morning he had told me he had not seen him since the Saturday; he said it must have been a mistake; after the robbery was discovered young James was kept separate from every body, until he told his story I believe - he was not allowed to leave the house. On the Saturday previous to the robbery two men came to me in the warehouse, in the afternoon or evening - one of them was about Coney's sizeand appearance, but he had a great coat on; they came about getting a job done - no other person came about a job that day; they did not explain what the job was - I do not know what reply I made; the person said he had been recommended to us - I declined the job, and told them to go to some of the shops in Holborn.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Smith said he had seen Josh last on Saturday afternoon? A. Yes, when he was talking to me - he said he came by appointment to go to look after a situation; he did not say he had been with him for the same purpose on Saturday.</p>

            - I think I know this Forget Me Not; I remember my son lending me such a book - I believe it to be the book he lent me; it had a cover to it like this - it is about a fortnight since.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he tell you where he got it? A. No, he said it was lent to him - I would depend on his word in such a case as that; he has occasionally taken little things from me.</p>
               <p>Coney's Defence (written). My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - I now stand before you charged with the commission of an offence which seriously aims at my life; but from the evidence you have heard this day, I hope you will be convinced that no reliance can be placed on the word of the boy James: Will you, Gentlemen of the Jury, doom me to forfeit this existence on the word of a boy who in connected with the worst of characters, and who has been away from his parents at all hours of the night? can it be doubted that he would not be guilty of asserting any thing, and screeming the actual perpretrators of this robbery, and place it on an innocent man's shoulders? Then Gentlemen of the Jury, I hope you will, by your verdict this day, restore my character unstained as you have heard this day it was, previous to this charge.</p>
               <p>Smith. I have nothing to say.</p>
               <p>Seven witnesses gave Smith a good character, and three deposed the same for Coney.</p>

In consequence of an alarm from the last witness, I went up to the first floor passage; I saw the prisoner - he gave me a push, ran down past me, and shut the door after him; I followed him into the market and gave charge of him - I saw this silver spoon taken from his pocket.</p>

            . I live at No. 8, Warwick-lane. I was called for, and took the prisoner in Newgate-market exchange - I found this tea-spoon, and eleven keys in his pocket, and this one volume of a book; I asked him if it belonged to him, he said Yes, he had purchased it - these decanters were in the room, packed up in the table cloth; I have a dial which I found on him, which is not in the indictment.</p>

On Wednesday, the 6th of February, I was sleeping there, and about half-past three o'clock in the morning I was disturbed by the rats of my neighbour nibbling at the wall; I laid awake from then, and between that and a quarter to four o'clock I heard the handle of my parlour door opened, which door leads into the passage of the private part of the house; I afterwards heard footsteps, and saw the reflection of a light, as I sleep with my bedroom door open - I, imagining my servant had got up earlier than usual, said, "Ann, is that you?" (I saw nobody at that time;) a feigned voice said, "Yes, Sir;" I instantly knew it was not the girl's voice - I rushed out of my bed, and made a regular rush at the prisoner, who I saw retreating out of the parlour door - I was so near to him in the parlour that I might have caught him myself; I saw his figure plainly, but not his countenance- I got very near him, and should have caught him, but he slammed the parlour door in my face, and slipped a little bolt in the parlour door outside, which prevented my pursuing him that way; there being a door leading into the shop, (I slept with that open as well as my bedroom door) I instantly ran to that door, threw back the bolts and the chain, and got out into the street nearly as soon as the prisoner got out at the private door - when I came out into the street I saw the same figure in full flight; I did not see him come out of the door - he ran away; I ran after him in my shirt, as I had got out of bed, as far as a neighbour's door, and seeing a Policeman four or five doors below, I thought the prisoner must have run into his arms, but he shot by him; I was shouting Stop thief! all the time - the Policeman chased him, springing his rattle, and being undressed I returned to put on my clothes, and then two Policeman came in - I let them in at the back kitchen window; they undid the fastening of the back door, and then entered the private part of the house - when I got into the passage I instantly saw Mr. Thomas Devey's coat and hat on the mat in the passage; he lodges with me - I afterwards went into the drawing-room, and saw things were deranged there; the prisoner was brought to the house in the custody of the Policeman: I then saw his face - he is the man who was brought there in custody; I examined the house, and found he had entered at the stair case window, which I found thrown up; I was not the last person who went to bed the night before - I had seen that window about eleven o'clock the night before; it was merely shut down then - I missed nothing of my own: Devey missed property, and in the passage the Policeman, in my presence, picked up some phosphorus-matches; the prisoner's figure is like the figure of the man I saw in my house, and who I pursued.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. By the figure, you, mean the back of the person? A. Yes; I left Knight, the servant up - the window, which was opened, was between the ground and the first floor; I swear I looked at that window before I went to bed; I lost sight of the man when he closed the door, and the next thing I saw was the same figure in the street; it was a bright morning - the moon was bright, and was going down; it was not foggy - the man got twenty or thirty yards; I lost sight of him when the Policeman pursued him - I was alarmed, but not the least confused or in fear; I had no light but what the person brought in.</p>

On the morning of the 6th of February I was on duty in Oxford-street, about twenty minutes before four o'clock, and within twenty or thirty yards from Mr. Buckle's door; I saw a man come out and slam the private door too very violently; in two or three seconds afterwards I saw a man come out of the shop door in his shirt and night-cap - at that time the first man was just passing me, and as the prosecutor called Stop thief! he said, "Oh, never mind him, he is a fool;" he was running at a brisk pace; I said, "Never mind that we will see about that," and we both ran as hard as we could; he ran down Oxford-street, and Orchard-street, into Portman-mews; I kept him in sight all the way till I came to the bottom of the mews; he turned down the mews - I was then joined by another constable, who is not here; I then went into Orchard-street - I then turned round, and saw him on an out-house at the back of Portman-street barracks; I said,"Come down, we have had a good run for you - come down, or I will shoot you;" the sentry, who was on the other side of the wall, said the same; two soldiers who were in bed got up, and one said, "Give me a firelock, and I will fetch him off;" he then jumped down, and I cut him on the head with my staff; he said, "You vagabond, what did you do that for?" I said, "I don't know, but I will take you back to the house you came from;" I apprehended him with the assistance of the constable, No. 40, who is not here - the prisoner is the man; he never got away - I tied his hands, in going down the mews he put his hand into his pocket, and flung out two knives and two half-crown pieces; Thomas Harrison, No. 22, picked them up before I left the spot - I am sure he picked up what the prisoner threw out of his pocket; I took him to Mr. Buckle; I searched him in Mr. Buckle's house, and this phosphorus-box was in his pocket; I was going to cut his pocket to get it out - he said, "I will get it out;" he took it out of his pocket, and gave it to me; these matches were with it - these other matches were found in the passage; I returned to the mews, as there was a shilling deficient, according to what the girl said she had lost, and I found these other matches, but not the shilling; it might be a minute from the time I lost sight of the man and seeing the prisoner on the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you observe the prisoner stoop? A. No, I never said so; when he came from the shed he was coming down at me; I struck him on the head with my staff as he came down - I have known him some time.</p>

On the night of the 5th of February I went to bed at ten minutes before twelve o'clock - I put my hand on the staircase window at that time, and the window was shut; there was nobody up in the lower part of the house at that time; I was awoke about ten minutes after four o'clock, by Mr. Buckle talking; I got up, put on my things, and went down stairs - I found the staircase window open, which I had left shut; I went down to the kitchen, and found the kitchen door open, and all my kitchen drawers, and a small work-box, with all my things, turned out, and some silver gone from my purse, which was in the work-box; I missed two half-crowns and two sixpences from the purse, and two shillings from a small paper box on my work-box, and four halfpence and a farthing out of my work-box, together with some beads; I missed out of Mr. Devey's drawing-room two small knives - one was a silver one, and the other steel, and the steel top of a cork-screw; they were Mr. Devey's- these knives are the same, I am certain, and this umbrella was taken from the drawing-room; I saw it there at half-past ten o'clock the night before, and found it in the morning, in the passage, standing by the parlour door- it is Mr. Devey's; this coat I saw the night before, laying on a chair in the drawing-room; I saw it in the morning in Mr. Buckle's parlour - these are my beads, which I missed, I am quite sure: I have some which correspond with them, and they are threaded on ribbon broader than heads are usually threaded on, and this steel top of a corkscrew I know; I was the last person up at night - my master and mistress, the prosecutor, and his servant were the only persons in the house; we never open the staircase window in the evening.</p>

On the 18th of January I was at Mr. Worter's, the pawnbroker's shop, and saw the prisoner Herrick come in there, alone - the prisoner Nicholls was outside the door; I did not see them together, but he said by the door when Herrick came in - I went out of the shop while Herrick was there, and walked up to Nicholls, and he said, "Do you want to buy a ticket of two pairs of shoes?" I said No - I did not see that he had any shoes; he was alone then, and I went home, leaving him standing outside the shop and Herrick inside.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A bricklayer's labourer; when I have nothing to do my father keeps me, and I have worked in a brickfield - I sometimes sell green-grocery in the street; I was never at Hatton-garden or any office on any charge - I know a boy named Couch - he asked me what expences I was to have here; I said I might have 3s. 6d. a day - a Policeman told me so; he is not here - he came on Sunday morning, and told me to come to the office on Monday, and I did not go; the Policeman came on Monday, and said, "You will be satisfied for your time, you will get 3s. 6d. a day" - I have 9s. a week; I have attended here three days and expect 3s. 6d. for each - I have seen Nicholls carrying a baker's basket about before; I did not see the ticket he spoke of - I was in employ last Christmas; my father is a bricklayer - there is no work for men, much more for boys; I have sold vegetables and onions about for the last three months - I sold some last week; I was once at Marylebone office - a boy lent me a coat; I did not take it back when he told me, and he sent a Policeman after me; I had gone into the country with my master's carter, but not to get out of the way - the young man did not appear against me at the office; he was employed at the turnpike - he was a friend of mine; I forget his name - I had known him about three months; it was six or seven months ago - I have not seen him since; he came to our house for the coat just as I came home from the office - I was in the watch-house from Saturday until Monday morning, but a boy found the coat at our house; I was taken at home - I had been in the country for a week, and he thought I had run away with it; I believe he lives at Battle-bridge - I never was at any other office.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to tell Couch you was to have 3s. 6d. a day? A. He called me over to his house, and his mother put Nicholls' mother behind the door - young Couch asked how much I should get; I said very likely 3s. 6d. a day - I did not give that as a reason for appearing against him.</p>

             (Police-constable S 194). I was on duty; Evans' boy called me on Friday the 18th, between seven and eight o'clock - I had not seen any of the prisoners that evening; I know them, and have frequently seen them together before - in consequence of what Evans' boy said, I went to the shop, and found he was robbed; we went round to the pawnbrokers, and found two pairs at Archer's and Worters: Ridpath would give us no information - when we took Herrick on the Saturday, we took him to Worters', the pawnbroker; he denied having been there, but when the pawnbroker said he was the boy, he owned it, and said he had taken but two pairs of them - that he took them out of Evans' shop; when we took Ancion, he owned that he had pawned two pairs in Somer's-town, and Nicholls owned that he had part of the money that had been raised - he said he had received 3s. 3d. out of 9s. 6d., and he said Herrick was the first that took two pairs out of the window; that he saw him - Herrick was not present; he said they took six pairs in all - he said he had two pairs himself; he did not say he took them out of the shop.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you tell Martin he would get 3s. 6d. a day? A. No; what I stated, at the office was taken down - I dare say it was read over to me, and I believe I signed it; I said there that Nicholls told me he had 3s. 3d. - I do not know whether that was taken down; I dare say my evidence was taken down - I do not know whether it was; nobody was present at the conversation.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is this signature your hand-writing, and what you said? A. Yes; I state here - "after Nicholls was at the watch-house, I asked if he was one of the three, and he said he had received his share of it."</p>

             (Police-serjeant S 1). I apprehended Herrick on Saturday night, the 19th, and took him to Worters', who said he was the boy who pawned the shoes; I took Ancion about one o'clock the same night in Hampstead-road, and on the Sunday in Chalk Farm-fields I saw Nicholls with some more boys, and he ran away - about half an hour afterwards I met him, I took him in custody, and found 1s. 9d. on him; he saw the other prisoners there, and in the course of the evening I said to him, "I suppose that 1s. 9d. is part of the money for those shoes" - he said Yes, that he pawned them for 9s. 6d., and divided the money - I neither threatened him nor made him any promise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Was any body present? A. Yes, a serjeant and a reserve man; 
they are not here.</p>


               <p>Ancion handed in a petition, as follows; "The humble petition of Henry Ancion - I hope your Lordship's usual clemency and lenity, will be graciously extended towards me in the situation into which I have been brought from want of employ, which I sought in vain; I was ignorant of the character of my companions when I yielded to their had example - I have had my name entered in the Marine Society, and was only waiting for the next vacancy to go to sea; a gentleman who frequently employed me, will come forward and prove I behaved honestly towards him.</p>
               <p>Two witnesses gave Nicholls a good character, and one deposed the same for Ancion.</p>

On Saturday, the 9th of February, I made the house up fast, and went to bed about half-past eleven o'clock - I was the last person up, and left every thing safe; I got up at seven the next morning, and found the shop door wide open, the pannel of the door was taken out, and the lock forced off - I missed five pairs of boots, one pair of spectacles, five silver spoons, a brass microscope, a pair of guinea scales, about 1 lb. of tea-dust, and a small quantity of two sorts of tobacco - I could not judge whether one or more persons had been in the house; I found a phosphorus-box, and matches, a latch-key, another key, and a pair of old dirty Wellington boots wet; I took off the clapper of the bell part of an old pocket, which had been put there as if to muffle it - I gave it to the officer Cooper with the other things; I had seen the bell at night - it was not muffled, for I unmuffled it that night - I always muffle it by day, and unmuffle it at night; I saw some of my property on the Sunday afternoon, at the station-house at Westminster - (Bugbud here produced the property) - I know these top boots - I never wore them; I have sold boots - I know them, and here is another pair of boy's boots which have my own writing on them; here is a pair of scales which I know, and another pair of boots and an odd one which I know - they are what I wore myself; when the bell was not muffled it would give an alarm if any body came in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What bell is it? A. One which we fix to an inner shop door; they got in at the outer door first - the shop door was locked the night before, and I found it wide open; the box of the lock was broken all to pieces - that is the inner door; the bell slips into a piece of iron - the outer door was not broken; they must have let themselves in by a latch-key, and forced the inner door - they could get to the bell by taking out the pannel; a hand could then reach it very easily and unfix it if they chose, but in taking it out it would make more noise than being muffled; I particularly recollect unmuffling it that night - I muffle it with a piece of linen, and that linen laid on a table close by; I will not swear whether that muffle was there in the morning, but to the best of my recollection it was.</p>

            . I am a Policeman of the B division. I was on duty on the morning of the 10th of February in Duck-lane, Westminster, about a quarter before five o'clock - I saw Still, who gave his name as Richards; his pocket looked very bulky - it was rather dark, and I turned my light on; I said, "What have you got here, my man?" he said he had got some tea which he was going to take to his mother - he turned his back to me; I said, "You must go to the station-house with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140016"/>me;" he said he would, and on getting to the end of Duck-lane we had to go through some posts - he went through first, and then ran away; I pursued, and never lost sight of him - he was stopped by Faulkner; I did not lose sight of him for a moment; I have not the least doubt of him being the same man - he was then taken to the station-house in New-way, Westminster, and searched; as I was pursuing him he threw several things away - a screw-driver, a pair of boy's boots, another pair and an odd boot, and a pair of scales and a case - Faulkner searched him at the station while I went to where he had ran, and picked up these things; I have had them ever since - I have not the least doubt of their being the things he threw away - I picked them up about five minutes after he threw them away, or less: Faulkner gave me the other things which I have produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not a very dark morning? A. It was; he ran up Orchard-street - he ran up Little and Great Dean-street - there is only one turning, which is from Little to Great Dean-street. I did not stop him - I did not see his face, - I could see his clothes; it was not so dark when I turned my light on - I saw part of his side face, because he turned it half round - but did not see his full face.</p>

            . I am a Policeman; I heard the cry of Stop thief! five or six times, and stopped Still - I had him in custody four or five minutes before Bugbud came up; as soon as I saw Still, I saw Bugbud with his light - the prisoner had come out of Orchard-street into Great Dean-street, and stopped in Little Dean-street - he had run fifteen or twenty yards; I saw Bugbud directly I stopped him turn his light - Bugbud was then about a dozen rods off; when I stopped him he put his hand in his pocket, and turned out a quantity of tea in the street; then Bugbud came up - he was running pretty fast; we took him to the station-house - I searched him there; I found a pair of spectacles, some tea; a snuff box, and four phosphorus matches in his pocket, similar to those found at Cramp's, and he had this pair of boots on his feet - I delivered the boots and spectacles to Bugbud; I was sent for on the day in question about two o'clock, to the station-house, and while there, the prisoner Bassett came - he did not see Still; he asked if Still could have any dinner brought him - he went away out of the station-house to go to Worship-street; I went and brought him back to the station-house, searched him, and found on him a tobacco-box full of tobacco, and a small purse with a lancet in it, and I found his right-hand trousers pocket was cut or torn out; the inspector asked where he lived - he said No. 5, Off-alley, Strand - I went there and found he did not live there, or I should have searched; I took his trousers off his legs, and Cooper, the Policeman, produced a pocket, which I saw corresponded with the trousers; I have not the least doubt of its being the pocket of these trousers, the trousers and pocket are here- I found nothing on him belonging to the prisecutor, unless the tobacco was his.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far was Still from the corner of Orchard-street when you stopped him? A. Thirteen or fourteen rods; I looked up when I stopped him - I heard Bugbud's voice calling Stop thief! and saw his light before I stopped Still; it was three or four minutes before he came up, I think.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Bassett came to the station-house voluntarily? A. Yes; the inspector asked where he lived - he took his address down, and gave it to me; I inquired at two Nos. 5, in Off-alley - there are two Off-alleys; I inquired at both - many persons there take in lodgers for a night, I understand; Bassett's pocket had been cut or torn out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon after you stopped Still did you see Bugbud? A. He was in sight when I stopped him; he was about sixty-six yards off, and came up running fast.</p>

            . I belong to the F division of Police. I got this pocket from Mr. Cramp - I got the trousers from Bassett at the station-house; he was wearing them - I saw the pocket and the trousers compared; they corresponded exactly; they are both here.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. Was the pocket in the state it is now? A. The very same state; the fear at the top would cause the tear below - I know nothing about the small tear, the smaller hole might be mended, and then the pocket would be good.</p>

On Saturday night, the 9th of February, I saw both the prisoner, about half-past twelve o'clock, at the same table in our house - I do not know whether they came in together - I went to bed at a quarter before one o'clock; the last time I saw them was at half-past twelve.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Can you tell us how much you drank at the Windsor Castle? A. No, I had some porter - I cannot tell how much I paid for; I will swear it was not two or three quarts - I do not recollect what I drank next; I had a glass of gin, I believe there, and a pint or two of porter - I will not swear I did not drink four pints of porter; I might have a glass of gin or two - I do not know how much; I cannot recollect whether I had any thing else there - I do not think I had any wine, but am not certain; I believe I paid the man for what I had - I do not know whether he waited on me all the while; I may have paid a man and a woman - I paid for every thing as it was brought; I believe the last thing I had was gin - I was not drunk when I left the Windsor Castle; I saw the landlady at the City Arms - I was rather fresh when there, I believe; I was sensible.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps then you recollect Turfrey requesting the landlady to give you a bed there, as you was so drunk? A. I cannot recollect it - I do not recollect seeing him there at all; I do not know at what time I left the City Arms - I do not recollect being taken out of that house by Harding in his arms; I recollect nothing till I found myself walking upon the bridge, which is forty or fifty yards from the house - I do not remember being outside the house by the shutters and falling down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not tumble into the cellar yourself? A. No, when I awoke at the station-house, I was surprised to find myself there - I do not recollect saying I knew nothing about Harding.</p>

            . I am waiter at the Windsor Castle, City-road. On Saturday, the 2nd of February, I remember the prosecutor coming there, about six o'clock - he staid there and had a pint of beer, and went out again; I know Turfrey - he came in about half-past five o'clock, and was there when Bodle came in, and remained there; they were in the same room - Turfrey offered some seals for sale, while Bodle was there; he remained there all the time - Bodle came back about eight o'clock, had a pint more porter, and remained there smoking his pipe till about half-past nine o'clock, and was singing, and then he had a quartern of gin and some warm water; he sung several songs after that, till about half-past ten o'clock - then he had a glass of rum in some warm water, then he sat till about a quarter after eleven o'clock, and wanted another glass of rum in warm water - master said it was too late to serve, and would not serve him with any more; he paid for the liquor as he had it, except for the glass of rum - master told him it was half-past eleven o'clock, and it was time to go out; I told all the people it was time to go - Bodle was going out without paying for his rum; master called him back and he stood talking in the passage while I let Turfrey out, and when I opened the door to let Bodle out Turfrey stood at the door, and they walked off together - the prosecutor was not drunk; he was capable of knowing what he was doing - he was not sober.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How far is the Macclesfield Arms from your house? A. One hundred yards.</p>

            . I keep the Macclesfield Arms. Bodle came into my house on the 2nd of February, a little before twelve o'clock, alone - Turfrey was there; I will not be certain which came in first - Bodle certainly had been drinking; he was not sober, but I think knew what he was doing - he had a glass of gin put into some cold water; he paid for it - I saw 8s. or 12s., in his hand when he paid me; he held it open in his hand for a minute -Turfrey was standing close by him, and saw it; the prosecutor asked me if he could have a bed at my house for the night - I said he could not, but I dare say he could get one in the neighbourhood; Turfrey told him he would give him a bed if he would go to Paddington with him -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140018"/>I told him he had better not go to Paddington, but get a bed in the neighbourhood, and desired him to have nothing to do with Turfrey, as he was a strange man; Turfrey did not like what I said, and got insolent to me - I ordered my servant to put him outside the door; and again told the prosecutor to have nothing to do with him; my servant took Turfrey by the arm, and rather lead him out of the house - Bodle stopped about two minutes, and then he went; I saw no more of it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. About what time did the prosecutor come to your house? A. About five minutes to twelve o'clock - I thought before he went that he had had quite sufficient; I served him as I should another customer - I was preparing to clear my house; he had a glass of port wine almost immediately after the gin - he mixed it all up together - I did not say any thing to him about it; he did not walk out of my house like a tipsy man - he was not very drunk; the City Arms is about one hundred yards from my house.</p>

            . I keep the City Arms. On the night of the 2nd of February the prisoner Turfrey came to my house - I never saw him before; it was about ten minutes or a quarter after twelve o'clock - he came into the house, and had half a pint of ale; Bodle came in five or ten minutes after - he staggered in, and the moment he got in he sat down on the bench by the bar, and said to Turfrey,"Old fellow are you here, you shall have a glass of something to drink," naming gin; Turfrey said he had rather not, he had got his ale, and would not take any thing more - Turfrey then came to me, and said, "I have been in company with this man before this evening - he wants a bed;" Bodle was sitting close to him, and was awake then - I said nothing to that, and Turfrey said, "He has got some money about him, I know, and if he will leave it with you, I will take him to Paddington to sleep;" I recollect nothing more - I made no answer about my taking the money, but some man at the bar said it would be as safe as if he had got it with him, if he left it with me, but I said nothing, he being a stranger - he fell asleep, fell under the bench, and laid there about twenty minutes, till I was about to clear the house; I requested somebody to go and take him up from the bench - Harding was the man who took him up - he was there when the prosecutor came in; he took him up several times, endeavouring to awake him, but could not - he was quite in a state of insensibility; I recollect nothing else - they took him outside the door, and I saw nothing more; this was about a quarter to one o'clock - it was some time before I could get him out of doors.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. At the time he left your house was he not in such a state of drunkenness that you would not rely on any thing he either said or did? A. I would not; I never saw a man more drunk in my life; I am sure Turfrey desired him to leave his money with me - I have known Harding four years - he is married, and has two children; he gets his living by working at the wharfs, or any thing he can get to do - I never heard any thing against his honesty; he frequented my house with a set of hard-working men.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When this happened was he in work or not? A. He had been at work that day at Green and Barrett's - I heard the men say so.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. On Saturday night, the 2nd of February, I was on duty in Wharf-road, City-road - part of my beat was in the City-road, near the canal-bridge; I first saw Bodle between eleven and twelve o'clock that night, it was nearer twelve; Turfrey was walking about three feet from him - he and Bodle were walking up the City-road about three feet apart; I did not observe any other person - they went over the bridge, and I lost them; I saw the two prisoners and the prosecutor, about half-past two o'clock, just coming out of the City-road into the wharf road - Harding had hold of the prosecutor's right arm, and Turfrey his left arm, and as they went past me, Turfrey said to him, "You make yourself drunker than you really are;" he said, "You know I am your countryman and your friend, why don't you walk as you ought to do;" by his saying that I thought it was not all right, and watched them; I went a little way from them, then turned back, followed them, and observed them in the yard of No. 33 wharf, all three together, but what they were doing I cannot say - Harding looked back, and then I popped behind a gate-post for them not to see me, and in about a quarter of a minute I looked again, and the prosecutor was missing; I did not know where he was gone to - the two prisoners were coming down the yard; Turfrey came out first, and Harding followed - Harding said to Turfrey, "Are you going home?" Turfrey said Yes - Harding said, "Good night," and they parted; Turfrey went one way and 
               <persName id="t18330214-7-person205">Harding</persName>
             the other - Turfrey had not gone above ten yards before he turned and came back, and wanted to make me believe he was as drunk as he could be to walk - I went and met him, and he said, "Have you seen any thing of a boatman?" I said No, I had seen no boatman, and as I told him that Harding came up (they at first were both going in a direction from me) - Harding said, "Have you seen him?" Turfrey said, "No, and the Policeman has not seen him;" I then walked towards the City-road, a few yards away from them - they went towards the wharf No. 33 again together; I went and concealed myself behind a cart opposite the wharf gate - they came out of the yard again, looked about for a quarter of a minute, and Harding said to Turfrey, "Let us go and see if we have done for the b-r;" Turfrey replied, "If we have not, we soon will do;" they went back up the yard again - I observed my brother officer Cook coming up; I called for his assistance, and told him my suspicious; we were going towards the gateway, and met the prisoners just out of the gate - we went up to them, and I asked Harding what business he had up that yard - he told me he had not been up the yard; I told him I had seen him go up; he said he had not been up - I asked him where the countryman was - he said he knew nothing about the countryman, he had not seen him; I said."Then let us go back, and see if we can find him;" he said very well, and we all four went back, and Cook, looking into an unfinished house, with a cellar under it, said, "Here he lays;" I turned my lantern on, and saw him laying flat on his back in the cellar- I thought he was dead; we then got the two prisoners down to assist him up, for I did not like to go down myself, for fear they should escape - Cook said,"Here is his pocket inside out;" it was his right-hand breeches pocket; I looked, and it was so - I then got the prosecutor up; I laid him down, sprang my rattle, and got more assistance - I said to Harding, "It is my opinion<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140019"/>you have robbed this man, and meant to murder him;" he said, "No, I have not;" I said, "I shall search you;" he said, "You may search me, I have nothing about me;" I then searched him, and found six shillings, five sixpences, and 1 1/2d. - I asked him how he came by it; he said he earned 1s. 5d. that day, and afterwards that he had earned 1s. 7d.; I asked him how he got the rest - he said he should not satisfy me; we took them to the station-house, secured them, and then fetched the prosecutor - he could not walk; we were obliged to get a truck; we could not make any sense of him - I could not tell whether it was with liquor or from his fall; my brother officer searched the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When you first saw the prosecutor, he was walking as if he was drunk? A. No, not when I saw him between eleven and twelve o'clock, but when I saw him near the wharf; I afterwards saw the two prisoners alone - they separated, went different ways, and then both came back to me.</p>
               <p>Q. If conscious of having done wrong, was there any thing to prevent them going away? A. No; I should have taken care that Turfrey did not go away - I was about five yards from him; he turned back and came to me.</p>

               <p>Q. After that they were looking about for him? A. They were looking for somebody - the cellar is six or eight feet deep; it is an open cellar - a drunken man might very readily tumble into it; he appeared to walk as if he was very drunk - he had the prisoners with him; the place is near the water - he might have fallen in if left alone. I thought it my duty to watch them, and not to go and inquire where he was going; the prisoners went down the cellar readily to help him up'; Cook did not go down with them, he took hold of him as they lifted him up.</p>
               <p>Q. If they were conscious of robbing him, might they not have put his pocket in before they lifted him up? A. We should have seen it; Turfrey did not appear drunk when we got to the station-house.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. How far from the cellar did you last see the prisoners with the prosecutor? A. Right opposite, about four yards, or not quite so far; I saw them all three together there - I did not see the prosecutor alone at all, till I found him in the cellar; they were all three standing still, opposite the cellar, when I last saw them, they were in the middle of the cart road, and after I had seen them together there I missed the prosecutor - the prisoners were then coming towards me; they could not get out without coming to me - I had lost sight of them for about a quarter or half a minute.</p>
               <p>Q. When they returned and asked if you had seen the boatman, are you aware whether they knew you had overheard them? A. I was close by them - they were not aware that I had seen them go up the yard a second time - they saw me going, as they thought, up the City-road; they both went down towards the yard; they were not aware that I overheard their conversation - it did not take half a minute to get behind the cart.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. If we understand you right, they separated once, and went different ways, neither of them then coming towards you? A. No, but after that, Turfrey turned back and came and spoke to me - while he was talking, Harding also came up, and asked if he had seen him; I then turned from them and they went towards they yard - they could not then tell that I could see what they did, as I went and concealed myself behind the cart; it was moon-light.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you saw the three standing together, how near were you to them? A. About five yards; it was moon-light - the wind blew very much, I could hardly hear any thing - it was a very boisterous night indeed: but I was not above two yards from them when I heard them speaking, and close to them when Turfrey said to the prosecutor,"You are making yourself drunker than you are;" they could not avoid seeing me then.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How near were you to them when they said, "Let us go and see if we have done for him?" A. About four yards.</p>

            . I am a Police-constable. On the Sunday morning, between two and three o'clock, my brother officer called me; I went with him to 33 Wharf, and when I was within nine or ten yards of the gate I met Harding, I walked up to him, and asked what he did up that wharf at that time in the morning; he said he had not been up the yard. I told him I saw him come out; while I was questioning him, Turfrey came out, and when he saw me, he asked me if I had seen a countryman of his; I asked him what countryman; he said, "A boatman that he just took up the yard;" he said, "We have been to look for him, but cannot find him." I said to both the prisoners"Go up the yard, and I will see whether I cannot find him;" we proceeded up the yard, about half way, and there is an unfinished building, and in the third opening there is a place dug out for a cellar, between five and six feet deep - I looked down, and observed the prosecutor laying on his back; I turned round to Harding, and said, here he is; he said, "So he is;" my brother officer turned his light on, and I thought he was dead at first - I desired Turfrey to get down, which he did, and we sent Harding down - they lifted him up, I laid hold of his arms, dragged him up, laid him on the ground, and his right-hand breeches-pocket was turned inside out; my brother officer said he had been robbed - I said, "Yes, it appears so;" I sprang my rattle twice, and another officer came up. I desired him to stand over the prisoners, while we laid the prosecutor in a shed - then we took the prisoners to the station, returned and fetched the prosecutor in a truck. I searched Turfrey on the spot, and found 1 1/2d. on him. I searched the prosecutor's pockets - he had no money at all, I did that when I came back to fetch him - in going to the station-house, Turfrey said he had nothing to do with leading the prosecutor down the Wharf-road. Harding turned round and said, "Don't tell a falsehood, speak the truth - you know you was with me."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you both the prisoners in charge at the time? A. No; I had Turfrey, Epps and another officer had Harding on a-head of me, he might hear what Harding said - I should think he could not avoid it. Epps said the man had been robbed; I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140020"/>not hear him say, "In my opinion you have robbed the man first, and then intended to murder him." I was not paying attention - I was three or four yards from him; I paid attention to some part of what he said, but might not hear all.</p>
               <p>Turfrey's Defence. Gentlemen, I hope you will look into it; I am myself really as innocent as a new born babe, of either word, deed, or action, but kindness to the man, to get him a lodging.</p>
               <p>Harding's Defence. I have had the distance measured from where the Policeman stood watching; it is fifty-eight feet from the hole - he was behind a cart which is across the road-outside the wharf; it is eighteen yards from the cart to the waggon inside the wharf, where he says we stood and made the expressions to each other.</p>

            . I am a coalheaver. I was on Sunday night with Harding's wife, and went with her on board the prosecutor's boat, and saw him - I asked him who was the gentleman that the row was with last night; he said, It "was me;" we asked him if he was much hurt - he said No, he was not much hurt, and if he could get his money again, he would say nothing about it; I said "What is your money?" he said, "Why, I want 9s., but bring me 8s., and I will not go up again" - I said the poor woman had not got 8s. then; he said, "Well, bring me 8s. to-morrow morning, and I will not go up again" - she pawned her bed next morning for 8s.; I took it to him - he then said "No, I will have a sovereign before I go any farther, and then I will give it up;" the prisoner's wife's sister was present when he said he would not take the 8s. - she not is here.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. You took him 8s. in the morning - where is he? point him out. A. That is the gentleman; I know the cellar of the unfinished building - I work just by: it is as near as I can say forty yards from the gate.</p>

             said he must go and pawn his watch, for he had only got 6d. left - he sent his brother Joseph to pawn it for a sovereign - he returned with the money; Joseph was with us at Kingston and Ripley.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are you? A. An unfortunate girl; I have known Allens about a month, or less, by seeing them about - they came to my sister's room at Brentford - I had the watch in my possession about ten minutes; it was not very common - it had a pink ribbon and key to it.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker, at Kingston upon Thames. On the 12th of January, a silver watch was pawned with me, in the name of Thompson; the Allens are so much alike I cannot swear to them, but I believe it is the one in the black coat (Joseph) - he was alone; to the best of my belief he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is yours an extensive business? A. Pretty good; I was asked about the watch about a week after - there was nothing particular in the transaction; I am almost certain it was Joseph, but the brothers are so much alike I cannot swear it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When were you asked about it? A.

            . I am coachman to Mr. Henry Valentine Stafford Jerningham, whose coach-house is in Grosvenor-mews. On Friday, the 18th of January, I padlocked the coach-house, and fastened it as usual, about three o'clock - master's chariot was in the coach-house; I left the property secure - I returned that evening about half-past six, or a quarter to seven, and found the padlock off the door, and it was tied inside with a pocket-handkerchief; I pulled it open, and on going in, I perceived the blinds of the chariot down - I opened the carriage, and the prisoner jumped out of the window (I had left the blinds up); he jumped off the box into the mews - I called to my son to stop him; I found one of the glasses of the sash of the carriage removed from its place, and put on the seat, and the top of the frame had been cut with a view to take it out - there are four glasses to the carriage; the first glass was taken out of the frame, and put on the seat inside - the frame was left in its place, but the glass taken out; the top of the frame was cut, and the glass taken out - the top of the other glass had been attempted to be cut off, but was not cut through; I had not the least knowledge of the prisoner - he had nothing to do with the premises.</p>

I saw the prisoner running, and both the Sharpes in pursuit of him; I went up to the prisoner, and told him to stop - he said,"Pray don't stop me;" I instantly caught him by the collar, and held him till Sharpe and his son came and caught hold of him - I saw something drop from his hand, and picked it up; it was this chisel - Plank took him to Marlborough-street.</p>

             was brought to me on the 18th of January, about seven o'clock in the evening, I found him with a severe cut in the arm - it had glanced across the arm; it was not a wound likely to endanger his life - it was within one-sixth of an inch of the blood vessels, which would have been serious - but in reality there was no material danger from the wound; a few fibres were divided, but not to interfere with the use of the arm - he can now use his arm as well as ever; it was such a wound as a knife or chisel might have inflicted - I think a knife a most likely instrument to have done it: I attended him eight or ten times.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The knife is blunt at the point, is it sharp in other parts? A. It is sharper in the middle - it is not a knife likely to inflict a serious injury; the wound was nearly half an inch deep.</p>

On the 13th of January, in consequence of information from Mr. Colson, I proceeded to Mr. Dixon's house, I found the gate open, and the door partly open as well; I went into the passage - the back parlour door was open, the side board door was open, and things strewed about - it was twelve o'clock. I looked all over the house, and found all the rooms open; I gave charge of the house to a person until Mr. Dixon arrived. About half-past eleven o'clock that morning, I had gone to the adjoining house, and heard a noise in Dixon's house, but did not suspect a robbery was going on; I heard a great noise in the house, and heard stepping, and noticed a great many people walking backwards and forwards before the house.</p>

            . I live with my father, who keeps a horse, and does any thing he can get to do - he is employed by a builder. On the 13th of January, between eleven and twelve o'clock, I was right opposite Mr. Dixon's door, sweeping a crossing, and saw three men standing about twenty yards from Mr. Dixon's house; I saw Short go up to the gate, and tap with his umbrella - he did not find any body come; I am sure he is the man - he walked up the street, and did not take any notice, then Godfrey went to the gate and just touched it; he put his hand towards the key-hole, and the gate went open; it is a low iron gate - Short had a long brown coat on, with pockets at the side; it seemed to fit him very well - I saw him go and put his hand to the key-hole of the door; the door went open, and he went in - he left the door rather ajar; Short was walking up and down the street - I did not see the third man at this time; I was on the right-hand side of the way, opposite Mr. Dixon's house - I looked at him; I am sure Godfrey is the man who went into the house - I stopped there till Mr. Colson came out; I saw Godfrey come out, and he had a red and white handkerchief up to his face, as if he was crying: he and Short went on together towards Hoxton - he left the street door and garden gate open; Colson spoke to me - I recollect Mr. Smith coming up; I attended at the Police-office on the Tuesday afterwards - I went to Dartford, in Kent, with the men afterwards; they took me there in a horse and cart - I should know them again if they had the same dresses on; I slept at Dartford that night, in a barn - the two men slept in the barn with me; that was on the Sunday, a week after the robbery - I was there three nights, and slept always in the barn; I left Dartford on Thursday morning - I was not at all pleased at being taken and kept there; the two men had gone out, and I took the opportunity of coming away, and walked home - I came to Islington, and went to my father's house - he lives in Shepperton cottages, in a house which is partly finished; I did not know where the men were going to take me to; Godfrey had a blue coat on - the third man had a long brown coat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You went to Dartford against your will? A. Yes; I never left my father's house before without his knowledge; Collier, the Policeman, gave me half a pint of beer at the first examination, that was all - I was quite sober; I never told any body that I had ale and rum given to me - I did not tell my father so, nor that the Policeman told me to swear to the men; my father was about twenty yards off when I saw the men - I was at the Painted Red-lion, Islington, where a gentleman gave me half a pint of beer with the Policeman; I went to several public houses to look for the men - I went to a public-house by the church; Brown, the beadle, gave me about a spoonful of beer there - I had nothing else; I am thirteen years old - I did not tell my father the Policeman told me, if I was asked the meaning of an oath, to say I should go to bell when I died; I do not know that I told him so, I forget - it was true, if I told him so, I think I did tell him; I remember it now - I never said the Policeman told me to say I was thirteen years old, nor to be sure to swear to the men - the Policeman only said, "Are these the men," I said Yes; I told my father the Policeman told me to mind to state they were the men, not that they desired me to swear to them - I was never charged with stealing; the Policeman did not tell me to say I should go to bell if I told a lie - I do not know why I told my father so; it was an untruth.</p>

               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Had you described the men to the officer? A. Yes; I shall be thirteen years old in March.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were you at Hatton-garden? A.

             and his boy; all three went into the cottage - I saw them come out all together; I gave Collier information about the men, and went about with him for the purpose of finding them; I was not present when they were taken - I went to the King's Head, looked into the tap-room, came out and told him the men were in the room, the very men I had seen go into the house; I did not see the prisoners, when they were taken, not till they were at Hatton-garden, but never saw them before.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that? A. I never saw their faces till they were at Hatton-garden - I know the faces of the men I saw go into the house, and could swear to them at this moment, if I saw them: they were all dressed like gentlemen - I never knew where the prisoners lived; I never gave the officers information where to find them - I never said they were the men; I swear that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. You looked in at the King's Head? A. Yes; there were twenty or thirty persons there, two in flannel jackets sat by the side of one another - I never saw the prisoners there; the persons I had seen were there - there is a back door to the house.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Were the two men who really had been to the prosecutor's, acquaintances of yours? A. Not at all; I only knew them by sight.</p>

            . I am constable of Norwood, in the parish of Hayes. I went with a search-warrant on the Sunday to the prisoner's house, and found a quantity of mutton, I took it before the Magistrate, all that I found there; there was the four shanks, part of the breast, and part of the neck in the pot; and up stairs I found all the rest, except two loins - I found nearly the whole sheep; the prisoner was a labouring man - I took all the mutton before a Magistrate; a butcher attempted to put it together with the skin - in my judgment it answered to the skin; it was very much haggled, not as if it had 
been done by a butcher; I was not present when the skin was found.</p>

            . I am a constable. I heard the cry of Stop thief! I saw the prisoner running without his hat - I followed, and stopped him; he said he had broken a window; I said he must come back and prove it - Darter came up in a very short time, and said he was the man who had stolen the tea out of Bread-street; he had a box with him then, I believe, but I am not positive - I saw the Excise-mark on the box; I afterwards saw it opened - it contained tea: at the watch-house the prisoner said he merely ran with other people.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Are you the person who apprehended him? A. Yes; a person had stopped him just before I came up, and he told him the same - nobody was holding him when I came up, the other person had let him go; I had seen him stopped on Old Fish-street-hill - Darter said, "That is the man that took the tea;" I stopped him in Old Fish-street-hill, by Labour-in-vain-yard, four or five hundred yards from where he had come, I suppose - I believe Darter had the box of tea with him; I know he had it before we got to the watch-house - it was enough for me to look after the prisoner; I had seen him come out of Distaff-lane.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Labour-in-vain-yard is not in Old Fish-street-hill? A. I believe it is - when I first saw the prisoner nobody but him was running, but several followed; there was nobody between me and the prisoner; I inquired all round the neighbourhood, and there was no glass broken; Darter was not with me when he said he had broken a window.</p>

On the 5th of February, from ten to eleven o'clock in the morning, he came to my house, and was about the coffee-room for about twenty minutes, or half an hour; he did not call for any thing - this table-cloth was placed in a cupboard in front of the bar, out of the coffee-room - and I ordered it to be taken out of the cupboard and placed in the coffee-room while the prisoner was there, as I had suspicion of his having taken table-cloths before - when he first came in there were six or eight persons there, and before he left one or two might have come in; a great many people attending the market breakfast at my house - I saw the table-cloth placed on the first table in the coffee-room; I saw him remove it on to a seat near the table - I was observing him all the time he was there; he stopped there till every body had left the coffee-room, and I left him there by himself, near the table where this cloth had been laying; it was on the seat at the time, where I had seen him place it - when I left the coffee-room, I went into the bar, to tell my sister to watch, and to call me the moment he left the coffee-room, and the moment he left I ran out; I could not see him for ten minutes - I then met him in Darkhouse-lane; I laid hold of him, and accused him of taking the table cloth - he denied it - I have never seen the cloth since; I went and looked behind the door before I ran out, and the table-cloth was gone, and I think that gave him the opportunity of getting out of my view.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You say the instant he left the coffee-room you ran out? A. Yes, after my sister called me - I ran first to look into the coffee-room; I passed the coffee-room door to go out - Darkhouse-lane is not a quarter of a minutes walk, but I went to search for him in different public-houses; mine is the Newcastle coffee-house - I cannot recollect whether I took his hat off when I met him; I went to his lodgings and saw his wife - she gave the duplicate of a table-cloth, but I found it was not mine; my sister was in front of the counter at the bar - I was in a small room behind the bar; I have not inquired at the pawnbroker's for the table-cloth - Mr. Cook, a salesman, and Mr. Reid were in the coffee-room, and several persons came in to settle with them; my waiter was not in the room, for I had my eye on the bar the whole time - I saw him go up stairs; I could see the coffee-room door where I stood, but could not see inside - I will not swear nobody but the prisoner was there.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there only two persons in the coffee-room? A. Not that I am aware of; I was standing at the bar, which commands a view of the whole coffee-room, but not when the door was shut - not one person came in after the prisoner left till he returned; two or three came in when he was first there - there were two persons in the room when I saw him take the table-cloth, and as soon as he took it, he went out; the two persons were still there, sitting in the box - they were across the room; he sat with his back to them - I am not aware that any body else came in while he was there - my brother was in the back bar, I was in the front bar.</p>
               <p>Q. While the prisoner was there, were there six or eight persons in the room, and two more came in? A. Not that I know of; the waiter was gone up stairs - I cannot say who served the two persons in the tap-room; I cannot tell whether they called for any thing - the prisoner was in and out several times; the prisoner might have had two coats on for what I know - he had a blue apron and a pocket apron, two aprons and two coats; the coffee-room door was fastened back, and wide open - he put the cloth under his apron; he could see me, as well as I saw him.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were the two persons sitting with their faces or their backs towards him? A. Their faces towards the door; his back was to them - they could not see him put any thing into his pocket, as the partition was too high.</p>

               <p>Pritchard's Defence. Clark saw me take it, and went to pawn it with me - Crouch put me up to take it from the gentleman; he then took us to the coffee-shop, and hardly let us have time to drink any before he took us away; he wanted to get the watch from me, but I would not let him - he and Clark went with me to pawn it, but Clark staid outside while we went in; Crouch wanted me to give him the sovereign, but I would not, I gave him 5s. and Clark 2s. 6d.</p>
               <p>Crouch's Defence. I went into the house for some refreshment - I saw Clark in the corner, and then Pritchard came in; I afterwards went with them to the pawnbroker's, but I did not see what was pawned, nor did I have any money.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. You pursued two persons? A. Yes; it was dusk - there were a great many persons passing - they had their backs towards me, but Howard turned his face, and I can speak confidently to him; I knew him as soon as he was brought back.</p>

            . I live on New Hampton-common, about four miles from the prosecutors'; I know nothing of the prisoner, but on the 8th of January he came about seven o'clock in the morning, and knocked at my door - I looked out of window, and he asked me if Cox lived there - I said Yes; he then asked if I was not a buyer of pigs; I said I was - I expected some pigs to come, and thought he had brought them; I told him to put them into the yard, which he did - but when I came down I found they were not those I expected; he had brought four, and asked me 35s. a piece for them - I agreed to give 28s.; but I asked where he lived; he said at Hatton - I went with him there: there was no person who knew him, and I had him apprehended; I showed the same pigs to the prosecutor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Were you in more than one public-house that night? A. Yes; I think we were in three or four - the first house was the Hercules Pillars, in Greek-street; we then went to a house near the Middlesex-hospital - then to Clark's, in Oxford-street, where you can get a glass after hours; I rather think we went to another house in Hanway-street - I was perfectly sensible; I might have a share of five glasses of brandy and water, and I might afterwards have some gin - we had not twenty-three glasses of brandy and water at one house; we had not so many as ten in one house - I do not think we had more than five; it was about ten o'clock when we went to the Hercules Pillars - I saw the prosecutor's bag there, and again in Oxford-street, and at Clark's, that was the last place; I cannot tell how much was in the bag, but I know there were some sovereigns in it, and a good deal of silver - I do not recollect a third female coming into our company, but when you get out of Clark's there will be a dozen females about you; I do not recollect any other female but the prisoners being about us after we got out of the last public-house - I had no intention of stopping, nor should I if Lee had not given me the challenge; there might be 12s. asked for two beds, but I do not remember it - there might be some other females about us, but none walked with us; we might go into some other house - I do not remember going into any house where there was an old Jewess, but there was a Jewess brought to the office who had bought the notes; I had never seen her before.</p>
               <p>COURT, Q. This Jewess was taken on suspicion of having purchased the notes? - A. I believe she was, but I never saw her till we were at the office; the two prisoners and a boy were in custody.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Sheppard say she saw the contents? A. Yes, at Mrs. Allen's - she said she saw them; that they were in a pocket-book, with a receipt for 10l. rent.</p>

             (Police-constable E 157). On the morning in question, about twenty minutes after six o'clock, I saw the female prisoner coming down the steps of the prosecutor's door, rather heavily laden; she had a basket in one hand and a bag in the other - I asked the male prisoner, who was letting her out, whether all was right - he said Yes, all was right; we followed her about one hundred yards, and then stopped her; she said she had got some wearing-apparel belonging to a man who was going to leave the house we had seen her come from - we thought it was not all right, and asked her what it was; she said she did not know - we asked her if she knew the person who was going to leave; she said Yes, it was her husband - we took her to the station, and found on her fourteen bottles of wine and two of brandy; she told me where she lived - I went there, and found seventy-four more bottles, which I believe to be wine, and three small cloths and one large one; I then went back to the prosecutor's house, and rang the bell; the male prisoner answered it - I told him I wanted to speak to him; he said he would be out presently - he had the chain on the door; I said I wanted him immediately - he went down, as he said to get his coat and hat; still the chain was on the door - I rang the bell again; the cook came, she went and told him he was wanted - he made his escape from the house, and was not taken for three weeks.</p>

Yes; I had not property fastened my boat, the painter was put the through the rails, and she had drifted to a barge about ten yards lower down; when I returned they were taking the candles - I could distinguish their persons; I have always given the same account - I was toying a little in the wash-house with the servant maid of the Half Moon, but I did not know her name; that was before I got the candles - I cannot tell what time I took the candles on board; I did not say I could not tell who took the candles.</p>

No; I was not at all acquainted with her husband - I did not agree to board her when she came, but she met with an accident, and no one came to her; I cannot say that I never went out with her, but it was before I knew what she was - I was not in the habit of going to places of amusement with her; I was not there above three times with her - it was her wish that I should go with her; I paid for her; she has gone without me, and I have lent her money - one gentleman used to visit at my house; a gentleman of the name of Thorn once lodged at my house - I lent the prisoner a shawl once to wear when she was ill; it was returned, and put into my drawer; that and other things were taken away - we went to different theatres; I went to the prisoner's husband to say she had robbed me - he said he had been the things about her, and he wished her to send them home; she said she would rather he transported than send them back; I said unless she did, and made arrangements to pay the rent, I would have her taken.</p>

               <p>SIR, - You seem to take a great deal upon yourself about my wife and family, although unknown to me, and now I must tell you, that all future debts she may contract with you, you must allow her to do so on her own account, for I forbid it on my account; do you think I am going to give up to an extravagant and obstinate woman - no, never; and the sooner she applies to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140036"/>parish of Huntingdon the better, as I am here to answer for myself, for I never will send a farthing until she complies with my request; and remember, the parish allowance will not be quite so liberal as my offer is, so, Sir, I think this had better close our correspondence, as there is plenty of things in the apartment to pay that sum - so that if I am troubled with any more letters from you about my wife's troubles, I must return them without any answer - some money will be sent if the papers come signed, and not one single farthing without; I must tell you, that she has had from me for May, June, and July 19l. - now if you are a man of family, I ask you if she ought to starve or not; I think, myself, the best way to settle this, will be for her to apply to the parish, and then I will pay into the hands of the parish what they deem sufficient - I have got copies of all my letters to her respecting what I proposed to allow her, then they, (the parish,) will see whether I wished her to starve or not.</p>
               <p>I am, Sir, your obedient servant, R. TAYLOR,</p>
               <p>SIR, - I have now to request that you will lend no more money to Mrs Taylor, that is to say, on my account - and also that the rent is at her own charge and not mine; I think it proper to give you this notice, after which you cannot call upon me.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutor. On the 17th of January I was cleaning the second floor window; I saw the prisoner on the area steps with this basket, which had the tea-pot and milk-pot in it, but I did not see them in it - I saw the basket, it is a fruit basket; I ran down stairs, and missed from the pantry the tea-pot and milk-pot - I went after the prisoner and found him in custody of a Policeman; in my way back from the place where the prisoner had been stopped, to the prosecutor's, I received the same basket which I had seen the prisoner with in the area, and in it I found this tea-pot and milk-pot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you know the prisoner before? A. No; I had a down view at him - the area gate is always kept locked; I cannot tell whether it was open on that occasion or not - he pulled the gate too, but I do not know whether it was closed; I lost sight of him, but for not more than five minutes - I had a sufficient side-view of his face to be able to know him.</p>

            . I am a servant, and live in Gordon-place, Tavistock-square. On the morning of the 17th of January, a little after eleven o'clock, I saw the prisoner and another person at the corner of Ansley-street; the prisoner had a flag basket, and was doubling it up - the other man had a sailor's jacket on; I passed the prosecutor's house again about half-past eleven o'clock, and saw the prisoner coming up the steps with the same basket hanging down which I had seen him with before, and it seemed rather heavier - I made a pause, and had a great mind to stop him; he crossed from one side to the other, and then ran - I ran after him, crying Stop thief! not knowing whether he had stolen any thing or not - while I was pursuing him he threw the basket, containing the milk-pot, tea-pot, and some lemons over the enclosure, and these articles fell out of it; I saw a fishmonger's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140037"/>servant, whom I had known for some years - I told him to mind it; I ran after the prisoner, and found him in custody of a Policeman, about a hundred yards further - we returned and received the property; the other man who was with the prisoner ran away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How was the prisoner dressed? A. In a dark jacket, with either white or pearl buttons; I had not known him before - I lost sight of him about two minutes; I stopped and took up the things when he threw them down, and gave them to the other person.</p>
               <p>GEORGE PAINE (Police-constable E 1). I heard the cry, and saw the prisoner running; I stopped him - he said he knew nothing about it; I asked what he was running away for - he said nothing at all; I took him back to Tavistock-square, and saw the parties coming after him - these are the property.</p>
               <p>MR. JACOB MONTEFIORE. These are my property; I had used these articles at breakfast on the 17th of January, about ten o'clock - I suppose the tea-pot is worth 9l., and the cream-ewer, 2l. or 3l.; I live at No. 24, Tavistock-square - I keep the house, and pay the rent and taxes; it is in the parish of St. Pancras - I do not know the prisoner; I know these articles by the maker's name on them, and by a dent or two on them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The officer did not stop me, but a man who owed me a grudge did; he winked at the officer, and said it was all right; and when he got back to the house he told the servant to go and see if they had lost any thing - she went down and brought up some spoons; she said the gate was locked and the kitchen door shut, and I must have got over the rails.</p>

             (City Police-constable 66.) I took the prisoner into custody from the prosecutrix - he said at the station that he had no occasion to be afraid, for they could do him no injury, as I could find no property on him.</p>

            . I am the wife of William Jones - we lived at No. 8, Playhouse-yard. The prisoner lodged there as the husband of a young woman in that house - I remember the two Policemen coming there in search of the prisoner; they came up stairs, and Mrs. Driscoll was in the passage - I heard a cry of Stop thief! and on going to the window, I saw Mrs. Driscoll running after the prisoner; I saw him again on the Saturday afternoon in Chiswell-street - I accused him of taking money, which I thought he had taken: he said he had taken no money, but the clothes and a watch - I asked him how he got them out; he said he put them under his own clothes, and buttoned his own clothes over them - he said he ran into a privy in Ball-yard, Drury-lane, and sat there till nine o'clock in the evening.</p>

I had seen all these articles safe about two hours after the prisoner went to had, on the same evening as he went away; I went up to clenn myself, but I declined doing it, as it was wet, and when I went up afterwards he was gone; I found his cap, his waistcoat, and a key of my bed-room in the room he had slept in - I had not seen my watch since the day before; it was in the same box my clothes were in, and wrapped in flannel.</p>

On the morning of the 17th of January I found a pair of half-fronts at the top of the cellar stairs, behind a candle-box, which was not a proper place for it- I lifted up the box, and found under it a pair of Wellington-fronts; this was about eight or nine o'clock in the morning - the prisoner was working about the shop at the time; I told my master, and then called the prisoner, who was then in the cellar - I told him to wait in the shop while I went up stairs; I returned in ten minutes, and when I came back the prisoner was gone in the cellar - I went to the candle-box, and the leather was gone, all but one half-front; I told master of that, them went into the cellar, and found the same pieces of leather which had been under the candle-box, under two papers - I watched the prisoner that day, on the Friday, and on the Saturday, at dinner time, I saw him come up from the cellar; I went into the cellar, and missed some of the leather which had been there on the Friday night - I told my master, then went after the prisoner, and brought him back with my master; the prisoner put his hand into his pocket, took out the four pairs of half-fronts, and said they were all he had.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you any mark on them? A. No, but they were at the stairs - I have known the prisoner for four years; I believe he is married, and has a family.</p>

            . I was informed by Brown of the discovery he had made in the cellar - I went into the sellar, and found this property concealed under the stairs; it was covered with paper - it was what I had seen under the candle-box, and there was one half-front left on the box; this is what was produced by the prisoner, and he said,"This is all I have" - here is a pair of Wellington-fronts, which one of a peculiar description of leather, which I believe, no person but myself cuts; they are a peculiar skin- the prisoner was the shumac man, a sort of porter to the men, he had nothing to do with this sort of leather, but with leather that was not manufactured; the hours of working were in summer from six till eight o'clock, and in winter, from eight till eight - I was in the warehouse on the Saturday, when the prisoner came from the cellar, and went out at the door; he was employed in the cellar in handling the leather through the liquor.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Then the cellar was the place where he was employed? A. Yes, and these the leather was found; there were other men employed in the cellar,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140039"/>but not at that particular part - this is the pair I can particularly speak to; it is what we call a kip, not a calfskin - it is a Russian hide; no doubt there are many of them in London - I do not curry them myself, but there is something peculiar in my way of currying; we have a peculiar pattern of our own that we cut by.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. These pieces produced by the prisoner are the same as those you have? A. Yes, they are curried in the same manner, and cut in the same shape.</p>

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoner; he took these pieces of leather out of his pocket, put them on the counter, and said that was all he had about him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you see him when he was first in the prosecutor's possession? A. Yes; he said he had lost property, and he suspected the prisoner had some about him - the prisoner took this out, and said, "This is all I have got;" he did not say it was Mr. Colling's - the leather was marked by me.</p>
               <p>JURY to CUTHBERT COLLING. Q. Do you know of any other place from which the prisoner could have procured leather of this description and quality? A. There is no likelihood of it at all - he has been in my employ six years, and had 17s. a week; there were 5s. found on him.</p>

If I had had the money he should have had it back; I had no thought of doing any thing of the kind - I did not know I had his hat till I got home, and went to hang it up; in walking that distance home I got rather sober, and I could not rest till I went back with the hat and handkerchief.</p>

On the 31st of January the prisoner, who was a stranger, came to the shop - he said he wanted two pieces of fustian for Mr. Curlewis who is a customer of ours; he asked for two pieces to cut from, which is usual in the trade, and I let him have them - I entered them in the book, but it was only to cut from; in two or three days we sent to Mr. Curlewis to return what was left, and he had not had them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How much of these articles did the prisoner come for? A. His words were "I want two pieces of fustian for Mr. Curlewis, to cut from, a dark piece and a light piece" Mr. Curlewis is a tailor - he did not mean the whole piece was to be kept; I did not enter them as being sold - I have entered thirty five yards, and sixteen and a half, as pieces to be cut from, and the rest to be returned.</p>

            . I live at the house in Whitcomb-street; I remember the prosecutor and prisoner coming that evening - I had never seen them before; it is a house of accommodation - they were tussleing in the passage for some minutes; I went out, and she was trying to persuade him to come in; he was very much intoxicated, and had been down in the mud; she put a shilling into my hand, and said, "This is a friend of mine I have known for fifteen years; he is a respectable man, the father of a family, and I found him in company with two prostitutes" - I took them into the first floor front room, and said "this room will be two shillings;" she said, "We came for nothing criminal" - the prosecutor sat down on a chair, and she asked him to send for some rum; he said, "I have had quite a sufficiency" - she said to me, "I know he has many guineas about him, you had better search him for fear any improper person should come up, and rob him;" I said, "That is a thing we never do" - she said."Then you had better search my pockets, for I must go home to prayers at ten o'clock at night, in the family I live with;" she then took out some pieces of bread, and said he took her to the coach-office and gave her some rum and water, and three shillings; she afterwards came down with a half-sovereign to get some drink - I said, "It is a thing we do not allow, for any lady to go away without the gentleman; and my master said there was 2s. to pay for the room - she then gave me the half-sovereign to go; I went, returned, and gave her the change - I then went up stairs to the adjoining room to where they were, to light the fire for some company, and looked through a crevice in the wainscot; I saw her on the bed, and the old gentleman tumbled down twice - he was partly undressed, and laid his clothes on the floor; he then tumbled on the bed, and complained of being cold, and she said she would get her gown and put over him - I then saw her take two sovereigns out of his pocket, I think his waistcoat pocket- she felt all his pockets; she held the two sovereigns up to the candle, put them into her mouth, and went to bed again; I then went down, and told my master what I had seen - he went up stairs, fastened the door of the room they were in, and sent for an officer; in about ten minutes the prisoner was dressed, and was calling to me to get her some rum to treat me and my master - she said the old gentleman was gone to sleep, and she wanted to go home by the omnibus, to her family; one sovereign was found in her stays, and one in her mouth.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I not beg you to take care of his money? A. Yes, and I refused - I saw you take the sovereigns out of his pocket; you had been drinking.</p>

He was formerly - he does not superintend the manufacturing department; he is the head of the whole establishment - the prisoner was employed there before me; in this entry there appears to have been an erasure before the word James - I do not know what that is; it might be there when I entered it - I make the entries in this book one day, and give it to the prisoner to post the next morning, about nine o'clock- he posts it, and returns it; no other person but the prisoner and me were employed in the writing department- the books are locked up at night in the store-room, and I kept the key.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you in the habit of giving liquor to ladies? A. No; I had not been out of my ship for a week before - this was done at their request, it was an accident; we went to a room in which there was no other person, but nothing passed between me and either of the prisoners before I went there - I did not say I wanted a wife for that night: my duty required me to go back to my ship, as I had twelve men to pay that night, and the ship was going away at four o'clock the next morning; Fitzgerald sat at a distance from me - I did not button up my pocket when I put my bag back into it; I rather think it was taken out of my pocket while I was reaching over the table to take my 2d.</p>

            . I am clerk in Messrs. Foster's bank, at Carlisle. On the 5th of January, the Rev. William Mark came to our bank with a printed circular letter, and 10s. 6d. in silver - he gave it to me, and wished to have the money transmitted to London; this is the letter which he brought- the blank describing the nature of the enclosure, I filled up, and enclosed in the letter half a guinea in gold, I folded it up, and wafered it; I placed it in a drawer in the Bank where letters for the post are placed, and on the same evening I took it to the Post-office, and put it in, to go by the London mail that night - the direction to the letter was all printed "To the Secretary of State, Whitehall, on His Majesty's Service, Issue No."</p>
               <p>The letter was here read, stating that the half guinea was enclosed, being a collection in aid of the National Society, addressed to "Joshua Watson, Esq., <rs id="t18330214-100-viclabel554" type="occupation">Treasurer</rs>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You put the half-guinea into the letter? Yes, I put nothing else into it.</p>
               <p>MR. SHEPHERD. Q. Was it loose in the letter, or enclosed in paper? A. It was closely folded in the inner half sheet - it was not likely to slip out.</p>
               <p>HENRY MEAUX. I am clerk in the Inland Post-office. The Carlisle mail bag of the 5th of January arrived at the Post-office, on Monday, the 7th of January - I opened it, and took out the letters; I put the franks on one side, and the other letters on my right - it is then the duty of the messenger to take the franked letters to the frank-table (looking at the letter); in the usual course of business this letter would be taken to the frank-table by the messenger.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. If a letter comes into the hands of an experienced person in the office, may they not discover whether it contains an enclosure? A. They may by the weight, or by holding it up to the light, or feeling it, they could tell this contained only one coin, but franks go to the table without being examined - an immense number of letters contain Bank notes; a great many of these letters came containing very small enclosures about that time - it was the prisoner's duty to stamp letters at the frank-table.</p>

            . On the 7th of January I was inspector of franks at the frank-table, and was on duty at the frank-table that morning; the prisoner was also <rs id="t18330214-100-deflabel555" type="occupation">employed at the frank-table</rs>

               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140051"/>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been in the office? A. Twenty-six years; there are water-closets for the clerks generally, but I do not know of any particular one for the messengers - there are four inspectors of stamps, but only two employed at one time; it is the duty of about seven messengers to be at the frank-table - I know Baker, a messenger; the frank-table receives all the franked-letters - we have nine or ten thousand in a morning; they are placed on the table indiscriminately at first - one messenger in particular sorts letters for the Secretary of State, and at one time that morning I saw the prisoner engaged in that duty - I cannot say who else sorted; I do not think I saw Baker there - little inaccuracies sometimes occur; there is nothing on the face of this to denote that it is a money-letter - coin is very commonly transmitted by franks; I never saw a particular Post-office stamp for money-letters - they are often endorsed "money-letter," but whether it is endorsed or not, if the messenger discovers it, his duty is to bring it to the inspector; it might easily escape his observation - the prisoner has been in the office seven or eight years, I believe; I understand his father was there a great many years before him; letters addressed to the principal officers of state are sorted inside the pound, which is the interior of the frank-table; a letter intended for the inside might, by mistake, he outside.</p>
               <p>MR. SCARLETT. Q. Was the prisoner employed on both sides the pound that morning? A. He was; if he found a letter outside; his duty was to put it inside.</p>

            . I am an inspector of franks. I was on duty on the morning of the 7th of January; Leighton and I were the only inspectors employed - I observed the prisoner about three-quarters of an hour after; I had been there in the pound - I did not see him outside; I was there about six o'clock - he was in the pound about a quarter before seven; I did not observe him there long - I missed him about seven o'clock, or a quarter after, and sent a messenger to ascertain where he was - when persons employed in sorting letters discover a money-letter, they should bring it to the inspector of franks; it was the practice of Leighton and myself to keep the money-letters until the end of the morning - I always keep them to the end of the morning, and then give them to Mr. Leighton in a mass, and he would himself carry both mine and his own letters to the clerk of the money-book; the messengers are very seldom trusted to carry them to the clerk; I have known an instance of one single letter being carried by a messenger, but under pocidiar circumstances - it is not the practice; I am certain I did not send the prisoner with any that morning - it would not be his duty to do so without particular orders; it would be against his duty to take it without orders; we never send a letter to the clerk of the money-office unstamped - they are always stamped first.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What letters do you and Leighton keep till the end of the morning? A. Letters containing coin - the duty would not end on Monday morning perhaps till eight o'clock, or a little after; I have sent a messenger with a money-letter to the clerk, but it is not the practice - our time is very precious, and we have not time to go there; business is done as quick as possible - inaccuracies sometimes occur without a criminal intent; the prisoner has been a messenger some time.</p>

On the morning of the 7th of January, by direction, I placed myself in a watercloset, leading from the passage of the secretary's office in the Post-office - I believe there is only one watercloset on that floor; I went there about half-past six o'clock, and remained there nearly an hour - about half-past seven the prisoner came into the water-closet; I took hold of him, and told him he must come with me - if any body except the prisoner had come there I certainly should not have seized him; I told him I must search him - he said, "Allow me to go into the water-closet to ease myself;" I said, "No, Hodgson, I can't, you must come with me;" he endeavoured to prevail on me to allow him to go in - I said, "Hodgson. it is of no use, you must come with me;" I took him into the adjoining room in the passage - I searched his coat, and could find nothing there; I then searched his right-hand breeches pocket, and took out a purse, containing three sovereigns and a half - I then searched his left-hand trousers pocket; I was in the act of searching it, when he put his left-hand into that pocket, and said, "I will give you what I have got;" he took two letters out, and gave them to me - I took them from his hand; I then asked where he had got them from - he made no answer; I asked him again, and he made no answer - I said, "Hodgson, you are not bound to answer unless you think proper, but it is my duty to ask you where you got them from;" he then said, "I got them from the office;" I asked him from what part - he said from the frank-table; I then marked the two letters - these are them, here are my initials on them; I took the letters to the clerk in waiting, then took the prisoner to Bunhill-row station, and went to search his house in Hertford-place, Haggerston - I found his wife there, and six or seven children, and she was far gone in the family way; I mentioned very slightly to her that there was some little suspicion of dishonesty, and under those circumstances we had come to search the house (thinking it not proper to state the nature of the case) - I found eleven sovereigns; I left one with her, and brought away ten - I then returned to the prisoner at the station-house, and took him to Mr. Peacock, the solicitor to the Post-office - Mr. Austin, the inspector of letter-carriers, had accompanied me to the house with the prisoner; we went in a coach with him to the solicitor's office, and in the coach the prisoner asked how his wife felt; Austin replied that he did not tell her the whole nature of the case, but that she felt rather uneasy - the prisoner then gave a heavy sigh, fell backwards, and said, "Poor thing, she must know it;" I then went with him to Mr. Peacock's office - I took him into the office, and Mr. Peacock said,"Hodgson, I am sorry to see you in that situation;" the prisoner said, "There is no one so sorry as myself;" Mr. Peacock asked how long he had belonged to the office - he said about eight years; I rather think Mr. Peacock took his answers in writing, but I am not certain.</p>
               <p>MR. PEACOCK. When I examined the prisoner I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140052"/>not take his answers in writing - I made a memorandum of a particular reply which he made.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. I take it for granted you cautioned him how he answered? A. I told him whatever answer he gave, might be used against him; I will send for the memorandum.</p>

             in continuation. Mr. Peacock said,"You well know the consequence of this thing, and you recollect what occurred this time twelve months"; the prisoner replied, "I hope it will not be so bad as that." Mr. Peacock then said, "You are not bound to answer questions unless you think proper - What explanation have you got to give of the letters, Hodgson?" (holding the letters in his hand) the prisoner replied, "What can I say, Sir?" I then took him to Bow-street; he was examined before the Magistrate - the Magistrate asked if he had any thing to say; he said No - I believe what he said was taken down; this was at the first examination - he was then remanded for a week; I attended the second examination, and what he said was taken down - (looking at two letters) these were marked by me, and are what the prisoner gave me; one was stamped and the other was not - the one directed to the Secretary of State is stamped; I have been employed by the Post-office nearly three years - there is one water-closet below appropriated to the messengers alone; there are others, but not near the messengers' - the clerks water-closet is nearest to the frank-table, but the messengers' is not a great distance, it is down a stair-case; he must go out of the office altogether, and along the hall to go to the Secretary's closet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you examine to see if the messengers' water-closet was engaged at the time? A. No; I should say he could not so well destroy a letter in other closets as in the Secretary's, because that has a spring lock to fasten the door inside, and he could fasten himself in, and prevent any one coming in - he did not tell me he had a violent pain in his stomach; he said, "Allow me to go in and ease myself" - he did not say he was in pain or any immediate pressing nature; there is a lock to the messengers' closet, but no spring fastening; the key is seldom inside the lock - I do not know whether it was in that morning, if so he could have locked himself in - I did not mean by what I said to convey to the Jury that there was no means of fastening the messengers' closet; if he went there and the key was not there, somebody might come in while he was destroying the letters - after I saw the letters he said, "Will you allow me now to go to the water-closet;" I said, "Certainly" - I had no motive in not stating that before; I did not think it important - he waited long enough to ease himself; I saw him undo his braces and sit down - the door was ajar - the letters were sealed when I took them from him.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you were examined did you recollect his asking to go in again? A. I did not - if the question had been asked I should have told you.</p>
               <p>MR. PEACOCK. Here is the memorandum - I recollect, by looking at this paper, that he said he was facing franks part of the time, and sorting letters part of the time; the rest of the memorandum does not relate to this inquiry.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Was he examined twice? A. Yes, before Mr. Halls - I did not attend the second examination - I took down from his mouth on this paper what he said; it is signed by the Magistrate - I read it over to the prisoner; he said, "That is what I wish to say." - (read.)</p>

               <p>The prisoner says "The letters I had in my possession, were for the purpose of taking them to the clerk of the money-book - I was taken very bad in my bowels at the time, and went to where I was taken; I went to one water-closet first, somebody was there, and I went to the other instantly; but as to stamping the letters, I did not observe whether they were stamped or not.</p>

             re-examined. At that hour in the morning every body is very busy - there is a large fire in the secretary's lobby; I do not know where the watercloset is.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Should you go into that lobby in going from the frank-table to the money-book office? A. No; I could have gone into the lobby if business took me there- I suppose I must have gone about business.</p>
               <p>MR. BOCKENHAM re-examined. I know the secretary's-lobby, where the fire is - there is a messenger to prevent persons going there who have not business, and to whom they must state that they have business; the messenger is forty or fifty feet from the water-closet - he sits in the outer lobby, near the fire.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Does he sit at the fire? A. Yes, or else he is going from one office to another; most people at that hour are engaged in their different departments - I should not pass near the fire to go to the water-closet.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. To go from the frank-table to the moneybook-office, should you go to that lobby? A. No; it is in quite a different part of the building.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. On the morning in question I was at the Post-office by six o'clock, and was suddenly attacked with a violent pain in my bowels, and ran to the closet - I found the first occupied; I came back to the office again, and resumed my sorting - I went to the Ship-letter office to leave a letter, and in my hurry took up the two letters in question, and made the best of my way to another closet, where I met the officer, who took me into custody, and to whom I delivered the letters which I had in my hurry put into my pocket; and which I might have put into the fire in the lobby, if improperly disposed; I declare solemnly my innocence.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's daughter-in-law. I did not know the prisoners until the 2nd of February, between five and six in the afternoon, when, I was coming down stairs, I saw them both in the passage - I asked them what they were doing; one of them said that as they were passing, the sack of potatoes had fallen, and they were lifting it up; I saw Kirkham lift the sack on Hart's back, and as they got to the yard I and my mother stopped them - they were just stepping outside the door; I fetched my father, and Lawrence came with him; they were secured.</p>
               <p>Hart. Q. Were the potatoes in the yard or in the passage? A. In the passage; I saw them on Hart's back - he was just stepping into the yard; they could get into Cloth-fair from the yard.</p>

Previous to January the 20th we had sustained considerable losses, and in consequence of that, on the evening of the 1st of February, I was concealed in the warehouse, between five and six o'clock, behind the door at the end of the warehouse; the prisoner was in their employ in the hosiery warehouse - the door has two squares of glass in the top of it, and I had a view of where he was; we usually drink tea between five and six - I had scaroely got concealed before the prisoner came out of the hosiery warehouse below, up into the haberdashery warehouse, and seeing nobody there, he went up stairs to the top warehouse, came down again, and called Jem; nobody answered, and he directly went to where the black silk stocks were, which was about the middle of the warehouse - I could see him through the glazed part of the door; he took up one parcel of stocks and laid them down, then took up another, twisted them up in his hand, and put them into his hat; the first he took up appeared spotted, those he put into his hat were black - he immediately went down stairs into the hosiery warehouse - I left my concealment, and was going to follow him down, when he came back to me and had his hands in his pocket - he asked me if I had any snuff - I said No; he then asked me if there was any more goods coming down to be entered; I said, I believe a small parcel was coming down after tea; he went down stairs - I met Nicholson coming from his tea, and told him; he told my brother of it; I was sent up to tea, and left it to them to watch. The prisoner went up to his tea; I could not see how many black silk stocks there were; an officer was sent for, who took him - he had no business in the upper warehouse at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What do you call these stocks? A. Opera ties; the top warehouse is the store-warehouse for haberdashery - he had no business there, nor in the other warehouse; his business was on the ground floor, at his desk, where goods are called over to him by the entering-clerk - I met him coming up a second time as I was going down; he was not in the habit of inquiring if more goods were coming down - he frequently came into that warehouse while the young men were at tea, and sometimes he had business there; he has been in the employ three or four months - I have been there six; goods are brought down to the ground floor in baskets to be packed - we carry them down; the entering-clerk has sometimes come up and taken a thing down in his hand; Mr. Sawer is the entering-clerk - the prisoner is the clerk to write the invoices; another clerk books them.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. How many are there in your employ? A. Between twenty and thirty - the prisoner had a particular seat in the warehouse, and had no business to leave it.</p>

            . I am the brother of James Wickens. It is my duty to mark the black stocks among other things- they were kept at the end of the counter in the warehouse on the first floor; the prisoner was employed on the ground floor, near the door - he had no business with the stocks in the upper warehouse; I know there ought to have been five dozen and a half of stocks in the place - I received information, counted them, and half a dozen were gone, and were found under his desk - they had no business there; they appeared to have been rolled up - I did not touch them, but fetched the officer; they were worth 9s. 6d. - half a piece of ribbon, measuring eighteen yards, was found with the stocks; that was kept in a drawer in the first floor warehouse - the prisoner could have no business with that; the sales were bought from our warehouse and entered by him; nobody could have any business to deposit these articles under his desk - the ribbon drawer was directly under where the stocks were; it could easily be taken, for we generally have the drawer open on the counter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where were these stocks kept? A. On the counter, tied in half dozens - the prisoner's only duty was to make invoices; another clerk entered the goods - we have about six clerks; he had no business to touch the goods - a person called a "giver in" calls over the goods while one enters them, and another writes the invoice at the same time - these goods were found under his desk; they were not covered, but were behind a box which he puts his feet upon - we had to move it before we saw them - I counted the stocks when my brother gave me information, and know six were missing.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Had the prisoner any thing to do with handling the goods? A. No, my brother was placed behind the door, in consequence of suspicion.</p>

            . I am a partner in the firm of Messrs. Rawson and others. The prisoner was in our service - his occupation was to make out invoices under the desk of the person who enters them; the entering counter<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140056"/>is directly opposite the desk - the giver in comes there, and calls the goods over - that is the regular system of business; the prisoner had nothing whatever to do with meddling with the articles of trade - we began to miss goods shortly after he came to our employ; I have seen the stocks - they are our property.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I suppose he has been up in your warehouse while in your employ? A. I have seen him there several times - he had no business there, but having no suspicion at that time I did not rebuke him; his duty could not lead him there - he might have gone to talk to the people there.</p>

             was with me, and pointed out what he thought belonged to the prosecutors; here are about twenty-two pairs of silk stockings, and a quantity of cotton stockings, in all about seventy pairs of stockings of both descriptions, quite new; a great quantity of lace, upwards of two hundred yards, and a gross of shirt buttons - I found some things concealed in boxes under the bed, some in baskets, and some in another place; he occupied three rooms on the second floor - I found a duplicate of stockings pawned with King.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He told you without hesitation where he lived? A. Yes; his wife was out, but on her return, she gave me every facility in searching, and said, she always told her husband not to bring things home, but he told her he had bought them as jobs; I never heard of his being in business for himself - I found other things there claimed by other people in whose employ he had been, and there was table-linen and other things in wear, in the same boxes; the lace was concealed at the bottom of a box of trinkets, and a paper carefully laid over it, so that it appeared the bottom of the box - you would not suspect any thing was under it.</p>

            , No. 16, Brownlow-street; this is the duplicate I gave him - they appeared new stockings.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is it not common to pawn in a false name? A. I believe it is.</p>
               <p>MR. ROBERT WALLS STEPHENS. I am one of the firm of Edward Rawson and Co.; we had missed several things; I have looked at these stockings - they are the manufacture of Mr. Gibbon, whose son is a partner in our firm, and they have my hand-writing on the paper - I can swear to them; I have looked at the different articles, and believe them to belong to us - I could swear to the greater part of them, and some corresponding with our stock I believe to be ours - there are about ten gross of shirt-buttons.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you any doubt but the property must have been taken at different times? A. It must have been taken at several times - we had missed stockings, but not black ones; our stock is so large, and so many goods lay about the counter - Mr. Gibbon does not make entirely for us, but these are a particular description of stockings, which had been re-dyed, and were in three pair parcels; we should sell them with the mark on, but then there would be the entering mark in addition.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. If you sold the whole parcel the paper would go with them? A. Yes; we never sold the prisoner any goods, and never had an idea of his dealing in such things, or I should not have employed him.</p>

On the 4th of February the prisoner came and brought some goods from Mr. Exton's; I was first going to pay him 1l. 6s. 6d. for them; I put 1l. worth of silver on the counter, but my husband called me into the parlour, and told me to pay him 13s., and send 1/4 cwt. of sugar back - I forgot at the moment that I had put the 1l. on the counter, and paid the prisoner the 13s.; I then remembered the money that I laid on the counter, and I said to him, "Have you seen any money on the counter?"- he said No; I said "Search your pockets and see if you have not - what money had you?" he said, "I have only 3d.;" I then gave him 1d. for half a pint of beer, and he went out of the shop - I looked about and missed the money; I told my husband - then went after the prisoner to Mr. Exton's, and asked them to send for a Policeman, but they would not; Mr. Exton then came in, and I asked him to send for one, but he would not; the prisoner then said he would go with me to the Police-office - I was going on with him and met a gentleman; I asked him if he would go with me to the station, which he said he would; the prisoner had denied it, and said at Mr. Exton's, that he had not got the money, all he had was 3d. - I had seen him move his hand in going along, from his breeches-pocket to his waistcoat, and the 1l. in silver was found on him at the station - I am sure I had left it on the counter; no one else had come into the shop.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. What was the amount of the goods the prisoner brought? A. I can tell the money I paid - I had paid him 1l. 10s. on the day before; and on that day I had paid him 1l. 10s., but that was the first time he came - he came again that day and I paid him 13s., when he denied having any more than 3d. and the 1d. I gave him for beer; he went voluntarily to the station-house.</p>

             (Police-constable D 11). I met the prisoner in Seymour-place; the witness said he had robbed her of 20s. - he said he had no money of hers; I took him to the station, and found in an inside pocket on the left side of his waistcoat, 14 shillings, 12 sixpences, and four pence in copper - the prosecutrix said, he had said he had only 3d., that he showed it her, and she gave him a penny for bringing the goods.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say that this was what he had saved from his wages? A. Yes; but he did not say that this was the amount of what I should find on him - I searched his other pockets; there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140061"/>small holes in each of his trousers pockets; his master said he had always behaved very correct.</p>

            , to purchase some glass articles; I saw two girls standing near her door, as I was going into the shop a boy came from behind the door, which was ajar, and passed me with some dishes; I considered Owen had been robbed, but I did not interfere, as I thought he might be her servant - but I turned my head and saw the boy give the dishes to a girl; I think the boy was Mead, and to the best of my belief the female prisoners were the two that were standing there - Devalien was the girl who received the dishes.</p>

            . I am a carpenter. I was at the Hope in Windmill-street at four o'clock, and again at seven in the evening - I saw the deceased there, and about eight o'clock I saw him drink half a pint of brandy which the pot-boy had brought in; I suppose it was brandy, but I do not know - I know brandy was ordered; no one gave it to the deceased, or coaxed him to drink it - he took it off the table, said, "Here is all your healths," and drank it, without taking it from his mouth - he then got up, lighted his pipe at the fire, and I went away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you hear him say he was ready to drink another if any body would treat him? A. He said something to that effect.</p>

            . I am a medical student. I opened the body of the deceased; the stomach was partially inflamed, but the appearance of the brain accounted for his death more than any thing else - the vessels were very full, in consequence of the liquor he had drank; I could smell the brandy on the brain and the stomach - the brandy he drank occasioned his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you many cases of this kind? A. Not very many - many perpersons might take half a pint of brandy without injury, or even a pint; I should not think a coachman would be likely to know that half a pint of brandy would be injurious to him.</p>

On the 29th January I met the prisoner at half-past nine o'clock in the morning, in Upper Holloway, carrying this copper on his shoulder - as I was coming down the road he saw me, and tried to get round a hay-cart; I asked him what he had got, and where he was going - he said he had got a copper, and he was going to get some pin-holes made in it, but he did not care where, as he was going to pay for it; these candlesticks he said he meant to get exchanged for steel ones - I then asked him what was in the bundle under his arm; he said some things he was going to get mangled for his wife; I found these pinchers on him, which he said he had used to take out nails - he said he lived at Finchley, and had done so for eight years, but there was no mangler there, and he was going to take the things to Islington, to get them done.</p>

               <p>WILLIAM MARTIN. I live at the East India Arms, in Fenchurch-street. On the 12th of February, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, I was passing <placeName id="t18330214-142-crimeloc803">Aldgate</placeName>

               <p>Prisoner. I was passing this gentleman - he said he had lost his handkerchief; I said I could not help that - he said I had got it, and searched my pockets; when he found I had not got it, he said he would swear he saw me give it to somebody else who ran across the road, but if he had seen that he might have taken the other person, as there were two friends with him.</p>

            . I was at that time shopman to Mr. Sears, a hosier, No. 32, Barbican, next door to the Red-cross-tap - there is a passage at the end of our window which goes up to the Red-cross tap. About twenty minutes after five o'clock on the day in question, I was behind the counter; I heard a noise as if some person had been knocked or had fallen against the window - I looked and saw the prosecutor knocked against the left-hand doorpost, by the prisoner, with his face covered with blood; as soon as I got round to the door, I saw the prosecutor forcing his way up the passage - there were three persons resisting him, and would not let him pass; the prisoner then took hold of him again by the collar, or by the ears, I cannot say which, and knocked him against the wall in the passage, and it seemed to me to be with violence - the people gathered round, and some persons called out"Don't hurt him," or "Do not hurt the man;" the prisoner then dragged him out of the passage, struck him twice, and the last time, he knocked him against the window of Mr. Borringdon, the grocer - the Policeman then came up, collared the prisoner, and took him into custody; there were several persons round the prisoner when he was taken - I did not see either of them walk off, nor could I see where they came from.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the prisoner drunk? A. He seemed to me to be sober. I was within arm's reach of him - I could not say whether it was a quarrel, but it came from a very noisy bad house; I rather think the prosecutor kicked the prisoner.</p>

             (City Police-constable 78). I was on duty at Barbican, at half-past five o'clock; I took the prisoner - I had seen him knock the prosecutor off the pavement into the road, and I took him to the station; I asked him why he struck the prosecutor - he said it was only done in a bit of a lark; I asked the prosecutor what he had been doing to the prisoner - he said they had been gambling at the Red-cross tap; he said he had lost 2s. 6d. and 1d., and the prosecutor had robbed him of it - I asked the prisoner whether he had got any money; he said No - I searched him, and found a key on him, but no money - there were two men came to the watch-house, and the watch-house keeper would not let them in; they said the prisoner was innocent of the charge.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took the prisoner were there any more about him who could have received any thing from him? A. O, no, my Lord, not within ten or twelve feet; I have heard what the prosecutor has said about his handing something to another man, but it was quite impossible.</p>
               <p>Q. At the time you took the prisoner was any body near enough for the prisoner to reach, to whom he had an opportunity of handing any thing? A. He had an opportunity, certainly, there was a crowd about.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the prisoner by the arm? A. No, by the collar - I am in the habit of keeping a sharp look out on prisoners; I had not two minutes walk to take him to the watch-house - I particularly observed what he did as we went along - I did not see him hand any thing to any one; if he had done so I think I must have seen it.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I am perfectly innocent - the prosecutor kicked my master on the knee, and **; I took him by the collar and pushed him down in the passage; I was merely taking my master's part.</p>

            . I live at No. 9, Reynold's-court, Ropemaker-street, Finsbury; I am a painter and glazier - the prisoner works for me. On the 18th of January we were in the Redcross parlour with a person named Stevens, having something to drink - the prisoner and I had occasion to go into the back yard, and we heard a dispute in the coffee-room; we went up to it, and it was with the prosecutor and some others, about a pot or a pint of beer, which the prosecutor had lost and would not pay for - they instantly began pushing him about, one to the other; he was pushed into the yard, and then into the tap-room and there some person, but I cannot say who, struck him - and I suppose he mistook me for the person, as he instautly at that mo<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140068"/>ment gave me a severe kick on the knee - he then kicked me on the ***; and after that, but not before, I certainly, slapped his face with my open hand - I had not struck him when he first kicked me, as I made the remark, "You are a deformed man, and I will not strike you;" after I had struck the prosecutor the prisoner took him by the shoulders, and turned him down the passage, but I did not see him throw him against any thing - I was in the tap-room, but I did not see him throw the prosecutor across the seat.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not throw him across the seat? A. No, I did not see it; whether it happened or not I cannot say - I was among them; I swear postively I do not know that it was done - when the prisoner took him and turned him down the passage he went out at the street door, and I went into the parlour; I had not been playing- I know the character of the house, but I did not see that part of it; I had been into the parlour, and went into the tap upon hearing the noise, and crossed into the coffee-room, which belongs to the tap - there are two parts of the house, and a passage in between them.</p>

               <p>Burton. Q. Can you swear I was with them? A. Yes, I am positive of that, though he had disguised himself as much as possible - when I saw him first, he had a frock-coat open, a blue apron under it, and a comforter inside - when I took him, he had his coat buttoned, and the apron and the comforter outside.</p>

               <p>Harrold. He stated that he lost sight of us, then went back to the carman, and asked if he had lost a coat; Maiden-lane is two miles and a half long, and is it likely we should have got so far? Witness.

The other prisoner, whom I had not seen for three years, asked me to go with him to Highgate, and then I told him I knew a nearer road home; we crossed over into Maiden-lane - the two officers jumped off a bank a hundred yards off; they looked in our faces, and took us into custody.</p>

The prisoner nursed me during my confinement, which took place on the 28th of December; she left on the 18th of January; while she was with me I missed some silver spoons, a table-cloth, and other things - while she was with me she had my keys to get whatever was wanted.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Did you miss them while she was with you? A. I missed the spoons; I had seen them in the morning, and am quite sure she had an opportunity of taking them the same day - I was not then confined, and I kept my own keys, but the spoons were not locked up; Elizabeth Smith was in my service at the time - she is not here, she left just after the prisoner did; I was given to understand that when we went to the prisoner's house Smith was there, and she got over the palings and ran away; she never returned to me - I was not on terms of intimacy with the prisoner; I had a pair of stockings of hers, which she lent me because I got out of my confinement too early to buy a pair which were warm enough, and she lent me a handkerchief which was more convenient than my own - I offered to buy it of her; after she left me, my children called on her occasionally; but I do not recollect their going at any time in a thin handkerchief, and her sending them home in a shawl.</p>

            . I am an officer of Worship-street. On the 6th of February I went with Mrs. Ayris to Nelson-street, Bethnal-green. I found the prisoner there - I asked if she had any thing belonging to Mrs. Ayris; she said No, and denied it strongly - I took her in charge, and searched the drawers, where I found these two remnants of lace; I asked if she had any duplicates; she showed me some, and among them I found one of this table-cloth; I then asked if she had any more property; she said No, but we found these two caps wet in the front room, and this Belcher handkerchief was round her neck - the prosecutrix claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you happen to know whether there was a girl there, washing, who left the house the back way? A. I have heard so, but I did not see her.</p>
               <p>MRS. AYRIS. I know this table-cloth by the cutting of it; it was a larger one, and I made it into two - I know all these articles.</p>

            . I am a french-polisher, and live in Turville-street, Bethnal-green - I have known the prisoner six or seven years. I recollect seeing the prosecutrix at a quarter past nine o'clock last Thursday morning - I met her, and she stood talking with me for a moment or two; she said she had found her silver spoons; a female was passing on the other side of the way, and the prosecutrix called her over and asked if her mother could swear to her spoons, as she had cleaned them many times, and she said she thought she could; I made the reply -"Can you not swear to your own property - are they not marked; or have they no initial on them?" she said No, she could not.</p>
               <p>MRS. AYRIS re-examined. Q. Did you ever ask a female whether her mother could swear to your spoons, because she had often cleaned them? A. I said that she had cleaned them many times, and I thought she could swear to them - I said, "I do not stand in any fear, though they are not marked, for others know them as well as I do;" I never said I could not swear to them - I was stating how old fashioned they were.</p>

I said Yes - I paid her the money, and she delivered me five doors in all, and amongst them were the two claimed by the prosecutor; the hinge of one is broken - this is it.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARP. This is one of the doors.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The doors were down when I took the premises - my husband is in confinement; I was taken nine times to Bow-street, and when the Magistrate asked me where I got them, I said I bought part of them at a sale, but that part was a carpenter's bench, and some other things - I offered the keys to Mr. Sharp, and he would not take them; that is twelve months ago - he said he had a deal of money owing to him.</p>
               <p>MR. SHARP. Some one called on me about nine months ago, and I think it was a woman, but no key was offered to me - the party stated they were about to take the houses, and asked if I had any claim for rent.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live in St. Ann's-court, Soho. I have measured she doors and door-ways at No. 13, Lumber-court - I am satisfied that these doors belonged to that house; I had seen them safe and the shelves also, on the Saturday before, - these shelves agree with the measurement of the place exactly; they are worth 10s. or 12s.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. That man never came till he came and took forcible possession - the first of this case was from jealousy; when I left the house, every thing was correct, and when I went again the house was nailed up - I got in and found every thing thrown about; my husband told me he wished me to clear the cellars of both houses, and part of these things are what were in the cellar. and part I bought at a sale - I considered them to be my own; I never pulled any of them down, but I got a person to get them out of the cellar.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM HUTCHENCE. The doors were in the shop.</p>
               <p>MR. MORGAN. This glass door was between the shop and parlour.</p>

On the 11th of January I drew my pension, and went to the Coach and Horses, at the corner of King David-lane; the prisoner came in there - I went home with her, and asked her what I should give her; she said 3s., which I gave her out of my pocket - I had then a sovereign and two sixpences left in my pocket-book in my jacket pocket - I had seen them about twenty minutes before; when I had been with her about fifteen minutes, she said she had a gown in pawn, and she would go and get it while she had the money - she went out, and did not return for two hours; I had then missed my money - I gave charge of her; my sovereign was a bright one.</p>

I have got 10s. left, and I will give you half of it;" I went to a house she described, but could not find the 10s. - my brother officer said he had seen four half-crowns in her hand.</p>

We had had a little rum; I was not affected by it, nor was the prisoner; the silk was missing; it was black, but it had been wrung, and would not stain any thing - I was about four yards from him when he put it into his bosom; I did not charge him with it before he went out - I did not know how to act, as my master was not there; there had been 41lbs. of silk in the parcel on the 26th, and this was on the 30th - there were seven other persons there; I saw the prisoner take one handful, but there were two missing - I looked at his shirt afterwards, it was not stained; that silk would not stain it.</p>

             (Police-constable H 87). I was directed to this house, to make inquiry respecting some other property which had been stolen; there is a lobby door there - I pushed against it, but could not open it; I looked through the window over the door, and saw the prisoner there, and this witness just throwing this parcel into a chair behind her; I went in and said to the prisoner, "How came you by this?" he said it was his own that he had bought it; I said, "You must go to the station" - he made no resistance, for I told him it was of no use, for I had assistance outside; I got a person there to take him to the station, and in going along he said he had bought it; I saw the same kind of print as this in a window in Shoreditch - I went there; they said they had not sold this, but referred me to Mr. Rotherham - and the shopman recollected that he saw three females, who said they lived next door to Old Sal, at Woodford-bridge - this is the parcel, it is dirty on one side, not on the other.</p>

            . I live in Massetts-place, Bloomsbury. I went to the George and Crown public-house on the 10th of February, to have a glass of spirits and water; the landlord reached it over to me, as I could not get near the bar; I drank it and handed the glass back, and while I was reaching I felt something at my fob - I looked down and saw the prisoner's hand let go of my watch-ribbon; he had drawn it up from the bottom of my fob quite up to the top; every part of the watch, the seal, and the key, had been altered in its position - I put my hand down, and my thumb caught against the ring of the watch, which joins to the watch; the watch was just out - when he found he was detected he commmenced fighting; I warded off his blows, got to the door, and called the officer, who took him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I called for half a pint of rum, and as I was taking it a fellow shoved it down; this gentleman then accused me of taking his watch - I told him to go for the Policeman - I waited till he came back with one; there were four or five persons between him and me. Witness. I am quite sure he is the person who had hold of my ribbon - he stood next to me when I felt it. I saw his hand let go of the seal and ribbon; I cannot say which hand it was - when I got to the door; I held the door, and called the Policeman, who came and took him.</p>

Between two and three o'clock in the morning of the 2nd of February, I heard some conversation between two persons who passed me, and in consequence of that, I went to a house of ill-fame, at No. 6, Isaacs-buildings - I found the prisoners there, and a man who goes by the name of Stewart; I took them into custody - the women was so tipsy that they refused to go; I called in further assistance - when we were going out the woman who keeps the house, sung out to them, "Where are the boots and shoes you had? I saw you give Broomy (meaning Stewart) a pair, and a pair to Peamey" (meaning a man who sells peas) - the other officer went up stairs, and found these two pairs of boots; and when we were at the station,

             (Police-constable N 8). The prosecutor came to the station; I went with him to the house, and asked the prisoner for her pocket - she took it off and gave it me; I found in it this half-crown, this one shillings, and this sixpence - I have known her some years; she has had a good character - her husband was a waiter at a tea-garden, but was out of employ.</p>
               <p>MR. BELLRINGER. These are a part of what I marked; the prisoner's husband was at home in the morning and evening - he still lodges with me, and is here now; I believe he breaks stones on the road; I have still lost 4s. - the prisoner must have had a key of my drawers; I kept my money first in the top drawer, and then moved it to the bottom drawer, but still it went - there was nothing found on her husband.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you mark all your money alike? A. Yes, with the point of a pair of sharp scissors; the prisoner lived in the front room on the first floor - she had no occasion to go through our parlour; I am out most part of the day - she could see when my wife went into the bakehouse.</p>

            . I live in the prosecutor's neighbourhood. On New-year's-day, in the afternoon, about four o'clock, I saw Maycock on the top of the archway, close by the yard; I saw him take a gridiron out of the wash-house and take it into a field - Bradley and Metcalf were with him; I saw them all three - I saw Metcalf alone two hours afterwards, carrying the washing-tub - they were all close to the house when they had the gridiron; there were four of them together, and at eight o'clock at night I saw Maycock carrying the beer-barrel.</p>

On the 13th of January I took the prisoners, Bradley and Maycock, at a coffee-shop, in company together; Metcalf I took two days after - he acknowledged being in company with the other two at the robbery; I did not ask him any questions, but he said he was with them when they broke into the place; and that the property was taken to Maycock's house, and that the washing tub and barrel were there, and the others were hid some where - I went to Maycock's house, but could not find the beer-barrel.</p>

On Thursday, the 10th of January, I had some conversation with him in the evening, in the course of which he showed me a bill - (looking at the bill) this is it; he showed it to me, and remarked that he would pay my landlord, Mr. Newson, the amount of his bill if he could give him change for a 100l. bill, he then put this bill into my hand - I read it over, and remarked that it was drawn out in a very unusual form; he answered that it was drawn out by a lady - this was about ten o'clock at night; on seeing him next evening, when he had reached the stairs leading to his bed-room, I called after him, and asked him if he had got his bill cashed - he returned to me, and said he had no knowledge of having shown me the bill, and said he had not got it cashed, but he should get it cashed in the country.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. You remarked on the extraordinary nature of the bill? A. Yes; I never saw one begin in that style before - it is the clumsiest performance I ever saw; I cannot make the name to the acceptance "Coke" - it does not purport to be endorsed by Bloom; I never saw an endorsement begin with "Messrs."</p>

             was at that time in the partners room, not in the office where the prisoner was; I desired the prisoner to take a seat while I saw more about it; he asked whether he had not better call again; he saw me go to a clerk to desire him to look after him, upon which he immediately begged to speak to me in private - I should not think he heard what I said to the clerk; I took him into a private part of our premises - he then said he had never done such a thing before, and begged me to let him go for the sake of his wife and family, for he had been driven to it by distress - he repeated this application to me several times, and he fell down on his knees; I desired an officer to be fetched - Furrester came, and he was taken into custody; I had no previous knowledge of him.</p>

On Saturday, the 12th<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140081"/>of January, I came to business at ten o'clock in the morning, and found the prisoner waiting in my counting-house - I believe him to be the man, but did not take much notice of him; I learned from him, that he came to make inquiry about a bill - he said the bill was at Barclays' - he said he was clerk to Messrs. Oxley and English, and was sent by Messrs. Barclays to make the inquiry about the bill; I do not recollect his saying why he was sent - he did not say why it was necessary to make inquiry about the bill; I told him I knew nothing about it - Mr. Samson Hanbury, my uncle, was not in town that day - he only comes to town on a Thursday, once a week; I said nothing to the prisoner about Mr. Samson Hanbury; while I was talking to him my attention was called to a letter addressed to Mr. Samson Hanbury - this is the letter: it was brought to me by one of the clerks from the letter-box, unopened - on inquiring about the bill, one of the clerks said, in the prisoner's hearing, that there was a letter from Barclays' which might refer to the subject, and this letter was produced - I opened it in the prisoner's presence, read it, and said to the prisoner, "I will inquire about it;" he immediately left - I gave him no letter to take to Barclays', nor was any given him by my direction; I have a clerk named James Young, but no

Joke or Coke" several times; also the words "accepted and payable at Mr. Gurney's bank, Fakenham;" the form of a bill for 447l. on 
               <persName id="t18330214-190-person1695">J. W. </persName>
            Coke, Esq., Walsingham, and various attempts at making an acceptance, and the signature of J. W. Joke.</p>
               <p>MR. WILSON. I have seen a great deal of Mr. Coke's writing; he writes the first letter of his name rather carelessly - it is something in the shape of a C.; I cannot say it never resembles any other letter.</p>
               <p>MISS BLOOM. I have been at Walsingham very frequently: it is a village - there is no Coke, Esq. there but Mr. Thomas William Coke.</p>
               <p>The prisoner handed in a paper, simply declaring his innocence, in addition to this, he made the following:</p>
               <p>Defence. Gentleman. I was perfectly aware I should be taken into custody at the banking-house, because I was aware that Mr. Hanbury was there; is it probable, if I intended to commit a fraud I should have suffered more than two hours to elapse between the time of my going to Mr. Hanbury's? or that I should return to the brewery two hours after, and inquire of Mr. Hanburys servant, at what time he would be at the bank? they said his usual hour was about two o'clock; I told them to tell Mr. Hanbury I would meet him there - I went and waited outside till Mr. Hanbury went in, and we both went in at the same time; I was labouring at the time under an abberation of mind, certainly I was not in a sane state at the time; is it likely I should have made two people acquainted with the bill under circumstances which would lead to immediate detection? if I had even got the proceeds of the bill; I stated to Woodcock that I was going to Mr. Hanbury's next morning, which he must recollect; the reason I went to Mr. Hanbury was, it was said the bill was sent in a letter, saying the owner would call in the course of the day, but I did not call, as I thought very probably, if I went, they might have offered me the cash, but that was not my object; I went in the morning and informed Mr. Hanbury of it; he said he was going into the City, and would call; now, if I had intended to get the money, should I not immediately have gone to the banker's, instead of waiting till I had been taken into custody? is it feasable that a man in his senses would have done that?</p>
               <p>MR. BEVAN. The prisoner must have been in the bank before Mr. Hanbury came in, for I had the letter in my hand, when he came into the room.</p>
               <p>MR. HANBURY. I understand he went and asked what time I generally went into the City; I do not recollect them telling me the prisoner would meet me there; I generally go into the City about one o'clock, but went earlier than usual, suspecting something.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you not call him a thief, and say he was robbing his master daily? A. No; I dare say I gave him a black eye, for I was obliged to strike him twice him my own defence; I did not throw him down - he tried to throw me down, and I tried to prevent his injuring me; he got down by attempting to throw me - I will not swear I did not kick him when he was down - I believe I did, but not violently; I swear I did not call him a thief - I have no recollection of saying he had robbed his master; Mr. Goodbody, jun. was not present at any part of it - the prisoner began had language to me the moment I entered the shop, without any provocation; if I said he had robbed his master, it is unknown to me.</p>

I was in the shop of Goodbody on the 18th of January; Oats was working there; I saw Curl come in between ten and eleven o'clock - I was on the other side of the shop, three or four yards from him, when this occurred; I heard Oats call him a swindler, and say he had been in<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140083"/>Whitecross-street - Oats struck Mr. Curl first; the moment he said it he struck him - Curl had made no reply; when he was struck, Mr. Curl hit him again, which knocked him down on the ground; and about three minutes after, he ran up to Curl and tore his coat: he had got up then - after he got up he ran to him, in about two minutes, and tore his coat; Curl instantly told him to be quiet for he wanted to have no more to say to him; I had not heard Curl say anything before - Oats then said "I will kill you, for you know if I can't one you, I will two you" - and about five minutes after it was all settled I saw Oats pick the wedge off the ground, and heave it at Curl - Oats during that five minutes was at his bench working; nothing had passed between Curl and him during that time, nor any blow of any kind; the wedge hit Curl in the face - Curl did not abuse Oats at any time - I am quite sure of that.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He never called him a thief? A. I never heard it, nor that he was robbing his master; I was near enough to hear, if he said so - I heard him tell him to get on with his work, and not rob his master of his work; the prisoner had two black eyes when he got up - he might have struck himself against the bench; I did not see him kicked, nor observe his mouth bleeding - the prosecutor struck him on the breast, which knocked him down.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended the prisoner on the evening of the 8th, performing as clown at Haydon's theatre - I found a pair of stockings on him sewn to his drawers; he was wearing them - I produce them; I have had them ever since; and I found this pair of stockings at his lodging - he told me he lived in the back room first floor, No. 8, Southampton-street, Seymour-street; I there found another pair of stockings laying on a chair.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Who else was taken up? A. Durden and a prostitute the prisoner lived with - Durden slept with the prisoner on the night of the robbery - I only heard that from Durden; the prisoner told me the particular room he lived in - that was before I told him what I took him for.</p>

               <p>JAMES MULLENIS. I am a Policeman. On the 8th of February, about half-past eight o'clock in the evening, I was on duty in <placeName id="t18330214-194-crimeloc1085">Mile-end-road, in Beaumont-street</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by DOANE. Q. Why not take them before? A. I could not, I was on the other side; I could see all that took place - I did not see them cut the glass; I had been there about five minutes.</p>

            . I rent the house; I am a hair-dresser. I had about sixteen dozen cigars in the window; one of the squares of glass was cracked, and puttied up - the glass was all in; I was out when this happened - next day I found the piece of glass was taken quite away; I did not look at it before then - a person could put their hand in through the hole, and reach the cigars.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had the window been cracked? A. More than six months; the putty was very dry, which would make it hold tighter.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Do you know when you missed your watch? A. I lost it between Bride-lane and the corner of Bridge-street - I do not know who took it; I was pushed about in the crowd - I felt it safe at the end of Bride-lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you walk one hundred yards before you said any thing about it? A. No, I did not go from the place - the crowd was greater near Messrs. Waithman's house; I had got no great coat on - the watch had a black ribbon to it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell the Magistrate that on missing it you went back to where you missed it, and found Pearson standing there? A. I do not recollect saying any such thing - he had not time to get away, for the watchmen laid hold of his arm directly he turned round.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When somebody called out the swell mob, I believe you were in the midst of them? A. No, I was against Mr. Waithman's house - there was not much of a mob when they were caught - there was plenty of room for me to walk; I sometimes get a job to cut bills for the newspapers, and have been a gentleman's servant; I do not keep a ginger-beer shop, but serve several shops with it, and stand at the corner of Old-street in the summer - I get my living in the winter, by any thing I can get to do; I have 1s. job now and then - I earned 2s. 6d. last Sunday morning; and can have a good character from Mr. Eaton, of the Saracen's Head, Aldgate.</p>

            . I live in Upper Thames-street; I am out of business at present. I was at the funeral, standing with Mr. Betterton, at the bottom of Fleet-street, on the curb, just by Mr. Waithman's corner; I felt a pushing come against me that turned me round, and I saw Pearson, Isaacs, and another person by Mr. Mitchell; I should not recollect the other person again - Betterton took Pearson by the arm, and said he had better go home; I did not see them do any thing, only standing by the prosecutor - I heard Mr. Mitchell say he had lost his watch; Betterton had laid hold of Pearson then - I did not see Pearson at the time of the shoving, I did after it was done - I called Davy to secure Isaacs, and he took him, in my presence.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You had seen them pushing about in the crowd? A. No, not till they came down on us; I am a jeweller, out of business at present, and live on my property, which is a little money I have saved - I do not go about to help officers; I had a case of my own here four years ago - if I happen to be with the officers I assist them; this is the first time I came upon a case - I have often been with the officers, but was never employed by them, nor have I ever been paid by the Police; I knew Davey when he came on the new establishment - I went to see the funeral, the same as others.</p>

            . I am one of the City Police. I was at the funeral, and saw Mr. Mitchell near Mr. Waithman's corner - I caught hold of Pearson before I knew that the prosecutor was robbed; I did not see any thing done to the prosecutor before I caught hold of him; I was standing with my back to him, or nearly sideways; I caught hold of him by the arm, and advised him to go away - Woodruff turned round, and said, "Here is a gentleman robbed;" I said, "Then you must stop;" and I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140087"/>said, "Woodruff, do you see any of the party?" he said,"Here is one going along;" I said, "Follow him;" he either followed him or sent after him, and Isaacs was taken - Mr. Mitchell saw Pearson in my custody almost immediately, and said he was one of the party who had hustled him; Pearson appeared to be in liquor, but he very soon became sober at the watch-house - whether he was in liquor I cannot say; Isaacs was brought into the watch-house within two minutes after, and a man in a brown fustian coat, who came in with Mitchell, gave charge of him - he stated, in the hearing of both the prisoners, that Isaacs was one of the party who hustled the prosecutor - Isaacs said something about his going to Ragfair; we had very few words, for I sent them to the Compter almost directly - Mitchell appeared before the Magistrate; he spoke more positively to one of the prisoners than the other, but which I do not recollect - I never saw him till Isaacs was brought to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did Parker come into the watch-house after both the prisoners were there? A. Yes, I think so - I never saw Parker before; there was a rush, which threw Pearson on my shoulder, as they stuck so close to him - I have known Woodruff some years, but never knew him as assistant to the officers; I have occasionally found him a very useful man on public occasions; he is a very respectable man - I believe he has a sort of agency business at times - I have known him employed to look after pavement contracts; I do not believe he ever employed himself in going with the officers - he might go round Bartholomew-fair for an hour for amusement.</p>

            . I am a Policeman. I apprehended Isaacs, under the wall of the Fleet-prison, in Farringdon-street, it was on the 14th of February; a gentleman named Woodruff came up to me and pointed to Isaacs, and said"Bill Betterton has got a prisoner - there has been a robbery, and there goes another of them," and I laid hold of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long have you known Woodruff. A. About eight months; he is a respectable man - I understand he has been a builder; he never went out with me - I have repeatedly seen him with other officers; he may have known me while I have been on the new establishment, which is about twelve months - I do not recollect his ever being at the apprehension of a thief with me; I have met him at public houses.</p>
               <p>Pearson's Defence. I had been to the west-end of the town, taking my sister's child home - the crowd were pushing me about, and somebody trod the heel of my shoe down; I turned round - I might have shoved the prosecutor; when I had put my shoe up I made the best of my way out of the crowd, and the officer laid hold of my arm, and in about ten minutes they brought Isaacs to the watch-house - he was unknown to me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS WOODRUFF re-examined. I did not see Isaacs hustle the prosecutor.</p>

I said "For aiding and assisting this man in trying to impose this crown-piece on me," and then he abused me; after the officer searched Castles, he put the crown-piece on the further side of the counter, out of their reach, and said it should be there till he had searched Bonner - Castles then made a struggle to get at it, and I prevented him; he said he would have it, and as he nearly overpowered me I called my man up - they were secured; I gave the crown to Bates in my shop after I had marked it - on Castles was found a good half-sovereign, a crown piece, and 2 1/2d.; and on Brown, 7s. 6d. or 9s. 6d., all good.</p>

            . I am a superintendent of the watch.

               <p>MR. FIELD. I am inspector of counterfeit coin at the Mint, and have been so many years. This crown piece dated 1819 is counterfeit - this one is also counterfeit, and of the same date, and both impressed from the same mould, certainly; they are Britannia metal, and ring extremely well - the other crown produced by Hounslow, dated 1820, is a good one.</p>
               <p>Castles The one Hounslow says he took from the woman I could point out among one thousand; all the letters under the chin are nearly defaced - I had it in my possession seven or eight days, and there was a mark where I dropped it on the pavement.</p>
               <p>Bonner. We desired that crown to be taken care of, as we know all the marks on it, which we could not do if it had not been in our possession.</p>

I was sent for to Robson's on the 2nd of February; a bad crown-piece was given to me - the prisoner said he had no other piece of money about him; I searched him at the Compter, and found a good crown-piece concealed between his legs, secreted - he had no bottom to his pockets, so that he could easily put it there; it was placed between his legs, and must have been done by his hands - I saw it marked; when I found where it was, I made him shake it out of his trousers.</p>

The prisoner came on Monday the 11th of February, about two o'clock, and asked for an ounce of shag tobacco; he applied to my sister - I saw him served; he offered a crown-piece, which I rang and weighed; it appeared good, and when I was going to give him the change, he said "I think I have enough halfpence" - he took 2 1/2d. out of his pocket (it came to 3d.); he took up the crown-piece which I had laid down; he then said "I will have half an ounce," he said "No, I won't, I will change, and have an ounce," and laid down a crown piece, which I did not take up, thinking it to be the one he had given me before - I had not sufficient change in the till, and sent my sister into the parlour for the cash-box; I gave him 4s. 9d. change - the crown-piece was still on the counter; he was scarcely out of the shop, when I took the crown-piece, and found it was bad - I, my sister, and a young person ran after him; a crowd brought him back to the shop - I sent for the constable, and gave him the crown; I am sure it was the same as he had given me the second time - he was searched in the shop; he said I must have mistaken him, that he had not been in the shop, it must have been some other man; I had no other crown-piece in the house whatever; 3s. 11 1/2d. was found on him - he then said if I would take that 3s. 11 1/2d., he would go back and fetch another shilling, if I would not give him in charge; I have not seen the first crown-piece again - he was brought back to the shop within two minutes; there were two women and another man outside the shop, and a man came in while I was giving him change, for a 1d. worth of shag, and they went out together - they appeared to know each other.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not put the crown-piece into your cash-box? A. No; I never took it off the counter till you were gone.</p>

               <p>ANN KNIGHT. I am the wife of John Knight, he lives at No. 190, Brick-lane, and is a block-maker; he occasionally works for the prosecutors - I know the prisoner, he is a watchmaker and general dealer, and lives in Mansel-street. On the afternoon of a Thursday, the beginning of February, I received a message by his daughter to go to his house on the Friday, which I did - I saw these handkerchiefs there, and while I was purchasing these four of them, the prisoner came in; I gave 11s. for them - the prisoner saw them, and saw me while his wife was cutting them off; I did not inquire where they came from; I had been in the habit of dealing with them, and thought them people of good character; I showed these handkerchiefs to my husband - he knew them, and showed them to the prosecutor.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q How far is Mansel-street from Brick-lane? A. I suppose half a mile, and six or seven miles from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I am the husband of this witness. I do all the prosecutor's business in block-making. On that Friday my wife showed me these four handkerchiefs - I knew they were not finished; I had a bill in my house, offering a reward for the robbery, and the mark on one of these handkerchiefs (H. F.) corresponded with the description in the bill; I knew that they were not finished, but every one would not know that; it would depend on their judgment - I should think drapers or persons dealing in them must know it; I went to Mr. Jones, and went with him to get a warrant.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. Is the mark you speak of, a paper mark? A. It is a printed mark on the handkerchief; I am aware that in cases of bankruptcy every thing is sold, whether finished or not - I know the prisoner: I am not aware that he knew that I worked for the prosecutors - he knew I worked for the trade in general; my wife did not know that these handkerchiefs were not finished; the chemical process which fixes the colour, does not alter the appearance of them.</p>

I was applied to by the prosecutor on Saturday, the 9th of February, for a warrant; I got one, and went with him to the prisoner's premises - he was not at home, but his wife was; I told her my business, and she produced to me this bundle of handkerchiefs, which I have here, from a cupboard in the shop; she made no hesitation whatever - I asked where they came from; she did not tell me, but referred me to her husband - I waited for him, and one of the girls went after him, but he did not come; I left a message for him, and in about an hour and a half afterwards he came to me; he said "I am very willing to go before the Magistrate" - I told him the prosecutor and another gentleman would meet him at six o'clock in the evening, and he said "I shall decline to answer any questions, till I go before the Magistrate:" he came again at six o'clock, and I took him before the Magistrate - he then stated that he bought the handkerchiefs of a man named Nathan, that Nathan's boy brought them to him, and he paid him 8l. odd for them - the prisoner was not then in custody; in consequence of what he said that night, I went and brought Nathan and his son, a boy about eleven years of age, while the prisoner waited; - the prisoner then repeated the same story, that he had the handkerchiefs fromthem, and gave 8l. odd for them; both Nathan and his son denied it - the Magistrate asked the prisoner if he had any bill of parcels or receipt, and he said he had not; to the best of my knowledge, he said they were purchased in his own house, and that Nathan's boy brought them - the boy was upon that given into custody, and remanded till Monday: the prisoner then produced two servant girls of his - they were examined on his behalf, and stated they had seen the transaction of the purchase of these goods, and that 8l. odd had been given for the lot.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BODKIN. Q. What time did you go to the prisoner first? A. About twelve o'clock; these handkerchiefs are very nearly in the same state as when I received them - they are not much more tumbled; I have been an officer for five years, and have known the prisoner as a most respectable man - I left work with his wife, and he came to me about three o'clock; I had left my card at his house - I told him the prosecutor would be there at six o'clock, and he went at large till then; the Magistrate took his word - he did not say that he had seen old Nathan at all on the business, but that he bought them of him, and his boy brought them to his own house; I think he said on the Thursday, which would be about the 7th of February - Nathan denied that he had sold him these, but he admitted that he formerly had had dealings with the prisoner, through the medium of his son; I stated just now that the prisoner's servants were not examined till the Monday, but I now recollect they were examined on the Saturday night; when Nathan's boy denied taking the handkerchiefs, the prisoner desired the two servants to be sent for, and they were examined separately - after that the prisoner was allowed to go home, and the boy was remanded till the Monday; I cannot tell whether these handkerchiefs would be useful to persons in their present state, or whether the colour would wash out.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140091"/>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Now just attend to me; the prisoner was allowed to go home on the statement of the two women? A. Yes; he was not in charge at that time - the boy was charged with stealing them, and he was detained. On the Monday, the two females appeared again before the boy, but the boy was discharged; the Magistrate asked old Nathan if he had had dealings with the prisoner before, through the medium of the boy; and he said he had to the amount of 15l. or 20l. - that was five or six months ago.</p>
               <p>MR. JONES re-examined. Q. What was the value of what you lost? A. About 50l.; they are worth 1l. a piece - I lost fifty pieces, but only ten are found; these were to receive five or six more colours - there are none sold in this state; I dare not offer them to any dealer in this state - they never leave us completely finished; they have to go to the folders.</p>

            , of Greenfield-street, Commercial-road, whom I have known as a general dealer for four or five years; he is frequently accustomed to send his son to my house with various kinds of goods, in the same manner as I know he does to other houses - on this occasion, the boy came with some handkerchiefs; Mrs. Samuels, who was up stairs with me, went down and looked at them, she came up and informed me that Nathan's son had brought some handkerchiefs; that she had offered him 2s. 6d., or 17s. 6d. per piece, and that he took them away - the boy returned, and I went down stairs; he said "Tell Mrs. Samuels she must give 18s. for them" - I said "No, I am positive she gave the full value for them;" I took them up stairs - I brought him down the money, which was 8l. 15s., for ten pieces; on the same Thursday evening they were put in the shop, and exposed for public sale - on the Friday morning I took two or three pieces with me to a shop; I could not sell them as they were bought too dear - when I came home, Mrs. Samuels was cutting four handkerchiefs from different pieces, which were sold in my presence to a Mrs. Knight for 11s., being 3d, each profit; on Saturday morning after breakfast I went out with several gentleman to visit the sick of a charitable institution of which I am founder, and have been secretary for nine years; when I came home, Mrs. Samuels informed me that an officer from Lambeth-street, with two gentlemen, had been there, and inquired after the handkerchiefs - that she went down with them into the shop, and delivered them all up, with the exception of five, which were sold; I went instantly down to the office, and informed the officer, that I knew from whom I purchased the handkerchiefs - I went before the Magistrate, and informed him from whom they came; I then asked the officer whether I ought not to go with him to Mr. Nathan's house - he said "You had better let it rest till the gentlemen call on you, as they agreed on, this evening, at six o'clock;" they came at seven o'clock, when the officer informed them of my having been at the office - I related to them the particulars of the purchase of the handkerchiefs; they inquired to whom I had sold the five - I informed them that four was sold to a Mrs. Knight for 11s., which circumstance he must have known to be correct, from the information he received; I then inquired whether it would not be adviseable to go to Mr. Nathan's house, whom I supposed would state from whom he purchased them - they thought it was best to go first to the office, when Nathan and his son were fetched; Mr. Nathan admitted that he was in the habit of sending his son to me, but said he had not to his knowledge been there for a fortnight - my two servants were sent for, and were separately examined on their oath; they swore to the identity of the boy, and to the circumstance of his having sold me the handkerchiefs - the boy was remanded, and I went on Monday with my servants to the office; the case was gone into before four Magistrates, which, after a long investigation was dismissed, one of the Magistrates particularly observing, that there was the manufacturer's name plainly on the goods, which was evidence that they were not bought or sold with any felonious knowledge; I trust that all the circumstances, the price I gave, the public manner they were bought and sold, together with my character, which has ever been unblemished, will operate on your minds in my favour. The handkerchiefs were exposed in the shop, and were sold precisely in the same manner as they were bought; nobody ever observed to me that they were in an unfinished state, and but for the prosecutor's own statement I should not have known it.</p>

            . I am servant to the prisoner and his wife; I know a young man named Nathan - my master has had dealings with Nathan for some time past. I recollect young Nathan calling at my master's on Thursday, the 7th of February, about four or half-past four o'clock - he had some handkerchiefs with him; I saw them - they were of this description, exactly the same - I do not know whether my master was at home; he was not in the place when the boy came - my mistress was at home; the boy had some conversation with her, and then took the handkerchiefs away - he returned in about five minutes, or not so long as that; he came in as he usually did into the kitchen, and I called my fellow-servant to call my mistress; my master and mistress were then both up stairs - they both came down; Mrs. Samuels bargained with young Nathan for the handkerchiefs, and he said that Mrs. Samuels ought to give him 18s.; the prisoner said Mrs. Samuels had bid the full value, and he could not afford to give any more - I saw 8l. and 5s. or 15s. paid; the prisoner took the handkerchiefs into the shop, and placed them on the counter; at night the goods are generally put in a cupboard, some in a trunk, and some in a desk.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know what time the officer came? A. I cannot say - it might be one o'clock or half-past one; the goods are generally removed from the counter and put away, in consequence of our Sabbath.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE. Q. What time does the Sabbath terminate? A. On Saturday, after dark - at half-past twelve or one o'clock, the Sabbath was in full operation; I was not in the shop on that Saturday, but our kitchen is even with the shop, and we see the things moved from the counter to the cupboard, and the trunks, as much as they will hold; I opened the door for Mrs. Knight when she came on the Friday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, as near as I can recollect; that was before the Sabbath - she was in the shop with my master and mistress; I did not notice whether these handkerchiefs were then on the counter - they were on Thursday night; I have seen young Nathan frequently - he seems to be about fifteen or sixteen years old; he is not very big - he came on the Thursday to the kitchen door, and I called Mrs. Samuels down - he brought a bundle tied up, and it was in a blue chequered bag, not a very large one; he talked with mistress for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - he took the handkerchiefs out, and put them on a chair - that was the first time he came; he came again in about five minutes, and came into the kitchen; my master and mistress came down together - master went up again, and got the money; the boy said, "Mrs. Samuels ought to give me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140092"/>18s.," and master said she had bought them well at 17s. 6d. - that was half a crown a handkerchief; I saw the money paid in sovereigns and silver - I did not see say receipt taken, or bill of parcels; Mrs. Samuels asked the boy how many pieces there were, and he said ten.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Is your mistress in the habit of dealings with Nathan? A. Yes, Sir - our kitchen adjoins the shop; dealings are generally carried on in the kitchen.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do not they bring goods in at the front door of the shop to sell? A. No, always into the kitchen.</p>

            . I am servant to the prisoner. I know the boy Nathan; I have seen him at the house frequently - I saw him there on Thursday, the 7th of February, between four and five o'clock - he brought some handkerchiefs for sale; I do not know whether my master was at home, but my mistress was up stairs, and she came down and bargained for the handkerchiefs - I saw my master afterwards pay some money, but I do not know how much; this was done in the kitchen - I saw the handkerchiefs - they were left there; the boy called twice about them.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE. Q. Are you sure it was not in the shop? A. No, Sir, it was in the kitchen, the shop and kitchen adjoin - the kitchen is more private than the shop; there is a shop door and a kitchen door, both come into the passage; I know the boy very well, but I do not know where he lives; he is a thin pale faced boy, not so tall as I am; I should think he is 15 or 16 years old - I did not let him in, but I came there after he had been there a minute; I came into the kitchen for something - I was at work in the yard; I believe I came in for some sand to scour some saucepans - I did not stop long; I left the boy and my fellow-servant there, and my mistress was bargaining with him; the handkerchiefs were tied in a bundle, and I saw him untie them - I did not see whether the bundle was in any outer wrapper; I did not see any bag - I did not see one on the table; if it had been on the table I should have seen it - he might have one under his arm; I do not know whether he had a cloak on - he went away for about five minutes, and then returned, and my fellow-servant called me in to call my mistress and I refused - I had gone into the kitchen the first time while the boy was there; I then went into the yard - I went into the kitchen again in about six minutes; I saw the boy there again, and my fellow-servant - my mistress was not there; I refused to call her, but I did call her - I am quite sure the boy had gone away, because I saw him go; I was in the yard, and the passage leads into the yard; he went out of the kitchen into that passage, and went out; the first door in the passage goes into the shop, and the next into the kitchen - my master mostly buys things in the kitchen; I went into the kitchen again, and saw my master pay the boy - I came in with a saucepan just at the time he was paying it; he counted it on the corner of the dresser; it was silver and gold, but I do not know how much.</p>

            . I live at No. 15, New-road, St. George's. I know the prisoner, and have dealt with him for six or eight years - I always considered him a very honest man; he offered me some handkerchiefs for sale on Friday, the 8th of February, and on the Tuesday before; it was two or three of this description; I think he said 2s. 9d. was the very lowest he could take for them - I did not think them worth the money, and did not purchase them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What are you? A. A linendraper - it did not occur to me that they were imperfect articles, and that the colour on them would he discharged by water; I did not observe that, I hardly looked at them - I believe I did take hold of them, and I found they were silk; the silk might he worth as much as it is now - I bought some a great deal better for 4s. each, something very similar to these.</p>

               <p>MR. ROWE. In the course of your experience with silk and silk handkerchiefs, have you often had articles of this kind offered for sale? A. I never bought any exactly of this kind - I did not want these, and I thought they would not suit me: I should think that these are unfinished handkerchiefs, if any one had pointed it out to me, but I should not have given it a thought at first - they are undressed; the goods in respectable shops are not in this state; they are done up in pieces, and made up, but these are quite in a tumbled state; I can see now that these are unfinished; I never bought any in this state, but I do not see why if a Jew were to take these about, many persons might not boy them in this state; but if I were to go into a warehouse I should not buy such, unless they were sold as a job lot.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Did you ever see such a job lot in any house in the City? A. No, I never did - I have no doubt now that they are unfinished; I do not know whether they should have had borders to them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Would that have struck you on a cursory observation? A. No, it is only from a more minute examination of them that I see they are not finished - I believe this is one of the handkerchiefs I had in my hand.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE. Q. Do you think that these goods could have been opened, examined, and bargained for by a person accustomed to the trade, without their seeing that they were not finished? A. I should not have noticed it unless any body had pointed it out to me - if I had looked them all over perhaps I might; I have dealt with the prisoner at his own house, and he called at my house once or twice a week; my wife generally goes to his house - I have gone there and looked at prints in his little back room - he keeps a kind of warehouse; I do not know that I ever bought goods there, but I have looked at them.</p>
               <p>MR. BARRY. Q. Have you ever bought soiled and damaged goods of him? A. Yes - I have known silk goods and other goods sold under extents and bankruptcies; there are thousands of patterns of silk handkerchiefs- I have seen many without borders like this, many with a white ground and black middle only; I dare say many persons would think these were finished - patterns like these are very common.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received an excellent character from twenty witnesses.</p>

On the evening in question, I was called out of the chapel at Brentford, and on going to Messrs. Booth's wharf, I found two snacks partly filled with barley, in the boat, and four in the saw-pit - the sacks were Messrs. Booth's, and the barley was theirs, I believe - from the appearance of the bulk, I believe some had been taken from it; I noticed an alteration in the bulk the moment I went into the granary - I have kept the barley separate which was in the six sacks, and I have no doubt it was the same as that in the granary; the sacks were worth 2s. each, and the barley 2l. 5s. - I suppose the granary had been entered by a window about two feet from the ground, two bars of which had been taken out, and then the doors were unbolted; the hole in the window was quite large enough for a man to get through.</p>

            . I am a painter, and was employed by the prisoner at the prosecutor's. The prisoner gave me this picture in May last, and told me I might take and pawn it, or get what money I could on it, till he could get money from Mr. Phillips to pay my wages - I pawned that and two razors for 10s. close by where I lived; I redeemed it on the 13th of December, and took it to Mr. Bardingdon, in Wardour-street, where I offered it for sale for 2l. 10s.; I was taken the next day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you know its value? A. No; I should not have thought it worth a quarter of what they say it is.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LEE. Q. Where did you receive the picture? A. At Mr. Phillips' door; I had no suspicion that it was stolen - I received it between six and seven o'clock in the morning, when I went to meet the prisoner; I never was in trouble before - I was taken on this charge, and confined forty days; as soon as I understood the picture was stolen, I told what I knew - I admit stating to the officer that I received the duplicate from the prisoner, but I did not know he was an officer; I thought there was something wrong, and I did not wish to bring the prisoner into trouble - I told the truth when I was taken into custody; I had a child by one Lambert; I was not brought up on account of forging a certificate of marriage - I did not produce to Lambert's mistress a printed from of a certificate of marriage; I was charged once with a rape, but I was not guilty.</p>

            . This is my own private property; it was not the subject of sale - it was at my house when the prisoner worked for me; I never gave it him - he stated to me that he had sent it to Birmingham; I know it by the size of it - by the subject - by the stock marks, one of which has been attempted to be obliterated, and by the name of Wilson, which was on it at my house.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it framed? A. I really cannot tell; I have fifteen hundred or two thousand pictures - some of them are taken out of frames to sell; this was at a house of mine in Warwick-street - the prisoner was employed there as well as at Bond-street; the prisoner said his wife had sent this by mistake to Birmingham, with some furniture.</p>

            . I live at No. 20, Ann-street, Waterloo-road; my husband died in July last - he sold this painting to the prisoner, between four and five years ago; I have no doubt of its being the same - the canvas on the back corresponds; but I think this looks rather cleaner.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. What was the subject of your picture? A. Three ships and a small boat, and the middle ship was rather sinking in the water; I am now in the service of Mr. May - there was some chalk on the back; I do not know that it had a scratch on it - I would not venture to swear this is the picture, but it is exactly like it; I did not go before the Magistrate - I was asked to come here last Friday.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS re-examined. Q. Is not the prisoner a very clever fellow? A. Yes he is; I did not know he was capable of copying pictures, till the other day one was shown to me.</p>

On the afternoon of the 13th of February we had six sovereigns in a box under the bed: I took it out, and gave my husband one of them, in the presence of the prisoner - I then locked up the other five sovereigns, put the box under the bed again, and put the key into a glass, in which I had been in the habit of keeping it; I went out between seven and eight o'clock that evening, leaving no one in the room but the prisoner - I had asked her if she would go with me; she said No, she would stop there and lock herself in - I returned in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; I found my door open, my three little children laying in bed, and the prisoner was gone - I went to the box, and found it a little way under the bed, not where I had left it; I took it up, it had been unlocked, and was open then, but the key was in the glass, as I had left it - I turned out the contents of the box on the table, but the five sovereigns were gone; I took up my infant, and went out, locking the door of my room - I found the prisoner in an alley, and gave charge of her; I had left my children in the room while I went out - the eldest was five years old.</p>

Yes; we all talked to her, and I believe said, in the officer's presence, that if she would tell where the money was, she should not be prosecuted; and she took the officer to the place where it was, and brought back the money - our house is in a large open back yard; we occupy the whole - it is only a small house, of one story high; it is in the parish of St. Luke - I believe the prisoner is a poor distressed creature, but I did not know much of her till that morning, when she came and said, that she and her children had not had a bit of victuals for two or three days; her children are now in a room, and no one to look after them - we took her in from charity.</p>

             (Police-constable G 134). I was on duty in Golden-lane on the night of the 13th of February - I saw this witness with her head on a window-shutter, fretting; she said she had been robbed, and I took the prisoner in a yard adjoining the house - I told her it was on a charge of robbing the prosecutrix of five sovereigns, and in consequence of what she said, I went to Mrs. Smith's, in Whitecross-street; the prisoner went towards a privy in the back yard, there put her hand behind a spout, and brought out this parcel, with the five sovereigns in it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. I believe she was promised that nothing should be done to her? A. Yes, she was - I have known her six or eight months, and never knew any thing against her; her children are destitute, and must go tonight to the parish - she had not changed one of the sovereigns; when I took her I believe she was coming back to the prosecutor's house.</p>
               <p>The prisoner received a good character.</p>

I said, "No, I am not in the habit of carrying so much with me;" he then said, "I must put on my coat, and go with you into the City, to the Bank;" I said,"That is a long way for me to go - I don't like to go there;" he then said, "Very well, I have a friend on the other side of the Commercial-road, who will cash my note, or lend me as much till Monday;" I thought that was not a long distance, and I went with him to a small shop on the other side of the Commercial-road; there was only one quartern loaf in the window - he knocked at the door, and asked if the man was at home; a woman came and said,"No, he is not, and I don't know when he will be at home;" he turned from the door, and came across the Commercial-road towards my waggon, and I said to him, "Sir, you will give me great satisfaction if you will show me the note you want changed, or show it to any respectable tradesman to see that it is all right, and then I don't mind going with you" (he had drawn some paper partly out of his purse when he asked me to give him change); he answered,"Come along, you are all right" - I said, "No, I don't like that, I will go back to your house;" he said, "It is at my option now, whether I return your flour or no" - he turned to the right to go towards the City, and I turned back to go to his house, as I was afraid I had lost the flour, as I had left nobody there but my boy; the door was shut, I knocked, and his wife came to the door, but she would not let me in - she peeped out of a window over the door, and said, what did I want; I then covered my horses up, went to the Thames Police, and stated the case there.

             (Police-constable K 178). On the evening of the 9th of February, I was sent by the inspector at the Thames Police-office to watch the house till the search-warrant came; I got there about half-past seven o'clock, and found this boy sitting on a bench in front of the window - my brother officer, Silvester (who is ill and could not attend here) came with a warrant about five minutes after nine; I then knocked at the door three times with my staff, loud enough to be heard in any part of the house, but no one came; I saw a square of glass over the door which was cracked, and bad a piece out; I tried to get my hand in there and broke a piece more glass out. I got my arm in,

             the lock back, and I found it was fastened at the bottom; I was about to get my staff in to force it open, and the prisoner came down stairs, without hat or shoes and opened the flour - Silvester told him he had a warrant for him, he said, "I have done nothing," I said he must consider himself as my prisoner for stealing twenty sacks of flour; he said he had done no such thing, and turned to go towards a back place through a passage; I followed him, but I could not see, as there was no light; as he was going along he gave a jump and his feet struck me - I said he had better come down, for I meant to have him; he came down, and I took him by the collar - he said he was only going for his shoes; his wife fetched his shoes down stairs - when the warrant was read to him he said he did not mean to defraud him; Silvester asked if he had a country note about him, which he had shown to the man; he said he had not, but he had had one, and he had given it to some person, but he did not know who; I saw the flour put into the waggon, and then took the prisoner to the station - I found on him 1l. and this bill of acceptance for 16l. 10s., which the prisoner said had been forged upon him by a person named Davidson, and I saw a person of that same at the office the next day; Silvester asked him if he had 43l. to pay for the flour - he said no, but if he had got the money for that bill from Davidson, he might have been able to pay it in a little time, with what he had in the house; I saw at the prisoner's, a table, with a carpet tied round it, and a pair of drawers, or a bedstead, tied up.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was there any attempt to remove any flour while you remained before the house? A. No; he did not offer any resistance.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Could he, from his window, see that you were waiting in the street? A. Certainly.</p>

             re-examined. Q. Did the prisoner interfere with the delivery of the flour beyond the weighing of the first five sacks? A. No - he said he was satisfied; he said, "Bring the flour in, and I will pay you;" I took it in, but I did not, in fact, leave it without my boy - I whispered to my boy not to go away, but I do not think the prisoner knew that he was left there.</p>

            , I am a working jeweller, and live in South Audley-street, Grosvenor-square. Barnes came to my shop on the evening of the 10th of December, between six and seven o'clock, and asked if I would purchase a ring, which he brought - I looked at it, and asked how he came by; he said he found it twelve months ago, and had had it by him, but he was then out of a situation, and wished to sell it to raise some money, and he said he had just come from Mr. Neat's, the pawnbroker, who had offered him 15s. for it, and said it was a diamond - I said I was not certain whether it was or not, as it was candle-light, but I would give him a sovereign for it; he wanted 30s. for it, and then said I should have it for 28s. - I refused to give it; he then said I should have it for 25s. - I refused; he left the shop, but returned and took the sovereign, and asked for a drop of ale, which I gave him; he came again the next morning, and asked if I would buy a gold chain - I took it and weighed it, and asked how he got it; he said of a friend of his - I refused to buy it, and he asked if I knew any refuers; I said Yes, and named two persons - he then left the shop; the diamond in the ring was a rose diamond, worth about 3l. - I kept it for a fortnight, and then being in want of a bit of gold. I melted the ring.</p>
               <p>Barnes. I asked him how much it was worth - he looked at it for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and said he would give me 1l.; I said it must be worth 30s. - I at last took the 1l.; I took the chain next morning - he said it was worth 2l. or 3l. but he could not buy it as he had no small change.

            . I am a porter at the Green Man and Still, in Oxford-street, and live in Queen-street. I have known Barues four years; he came to me about the middle of December, and showed me a ring and a brooch; there were three stones in the ring, and I think three small ones and one large one in the brooch - he said he had found them or knew somebody who had, and he must dispose of them; I took them to Dobree's, to ascertain the value of them - they asked if I was going to buy them; I said Yes, for 10s. - they said I could not be hurt at that, and I bought them; I sold them to a Jew the next day for 4s., as I did not know what they were.</p>

            . I live in Princes-street, and am a refiner. On the 11th of December Barnes brought this gold chain to me; I asked where he got it - he said it belonged to his sister, who was nursemaid to a lady; I asked what his father was - he said a shoemaker, at No. 15, Weston-street, Somers-town; I was not satisfied, and told him I should not buy it - I detained it, and gave him a voucher to show his father; I went in the evening with an officer to find him, but I could not - this is the chain; it is worth about 3l.; I gave it up at the station.</p>

On the 5th of February, about twelve o'clock at night, I was standing at my door - the prisoner came up, drew my watch out of my fob, and ran away; I pursued - he threw it away; I gave him in custody, and the Policeman picked up the watch - I was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Were you sober enough to remember whether there was a lady standing at the door with you? A. There was not at that time - I had been previously speaking to a female; I do not know who she was - we might have been ten minutes together; this watch has no mark on the glass, or on the silver, but it was thrown down on the side of the door, and fell on the step; it did not slip down while I was with the lady - the prisoner threw it down.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever say that if the prisoner mentioned one word about females, you would not recommend him to mercy? A. No; I did not say so at a public-house in Little Paternoster-row - I saw Mr. Fish at the public-house a few days after the robbery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say that the prisoner gave you a blow on the breast? A. Not a violent blow, Sir - I believe, I said so at the Police-office, but he did not strike me to hurt me; he denied all knowledge of me or of the robbery - I do not recollect showing the Policeman the door at which I had been standing - no woman came forward and said she had seen me a little before, creating a disturbance with a woman in Union-street; I am positive the prisoner drew my watch out.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had you been drinking at more than one public-house? A. Not to my knowledge - I had been speaking to the woman in Union-street, not more than a dozen yards from where the officer found the watch.</p>

I was on duty near the prosecutor's, I heard the cry of Police! and saw the prisoner walking - he stopped when I saw him; the prosecutor came out of the court, and charged him with striking him with one hand, and taking his watch with the other; he said he shoved him in the breast, and took his watch - the prisoner said he never saw the watch; I took him to the station, and returned to the court - I could not find the watch then - but I found it, when I came round a second time, in the place where the prosecutor said he had been robbed, about three or four yards from where I took the prisoner; I had looked in the same place the first time, but had not turned my light on - it was in a dark corner against the step of a door; it laid with the glass uppermost, and the chain on it - the prisoner passed that spot with his left hand to the wall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Have you heard the prosecutor swear it was thrown down? A. Yes; I did not see the prisoner throw it - the prosecutor was in liquor; he did not tell me he had been talking to a female - the prisoner might have thrown the watch down, and I not see him; it laid against the step of a door, and the chain was regularly laid on it.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer and builder, and live in Union-street, Middlesex-hospital. I was in Smithfield on a Friday in January, I think it was the 25th, and saw the prisoner with a horse; I offered him 6l. 10s. for it - he rather laughed at me; he wanted 10l. - I gave him my card, and told him if he could not make a better price he might call on me; and in a few minutes as I was going to Duke-street, I saw him treating with a man, and he sold it for 7l. 10s. - the man said, "My name is at the back of the note, my name is Hannell;" he gave him a 5l. note and two sovereigns, but I do not know what silver.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How came you so near them? A. I had been<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140103"/>to Duke-street - the person I wanted was dead, and I returned directly; I did not wait with the prisoner five minutes - the horse would have been a bargain at the money I offered; they were in the act of settling for it when I came up - I had no particular reason to notice what money was paid; I did not know the prisoner before - a letter was sent to me about three weeks ago to come as a witness; I left the letter at Guildhall - I did not ask the prisoner where he lived; the Magistrate told me I need not attend any more, but the prisoner's master came and begged me to attend here - I have several houses; I did not see the name of Hannell on the note.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What colour was the horse? Q. Grey - I sometimes have occasion for two horses, and thought as Spring was coming I should want one.</p>

            . I keep a coffee and chop-house, No. 32, Lime-street. On the 6th of February, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Casey came to me; I had seen him before - he offered me a sample of brandy and hollands; I approved of it, and was to give him 15s. a gallon - I ordered two gallons of each, and two two-gallon casks came to me, in consequence of the order, about seven o'clock the same evening; Casey and some stranger brought them - it was not Taylor; they took the casks into the coffee-room: Casey had one cask tied in a handkerchief, and the other had the other cask in a bag; they were placed in the coffee-room - I was to pay for them then; they came to 3l. - when they brought them, I desired my waiter to laste it, and he said the spirit was very good, but it was very thick and muddy, and I declined having any thing to do with it, but the other man said he had had it a long time, and I should have it for 2l., which I paid for it; at that time I believed the casks were full of liquor - I went down stairs to pay them; Casey said, "You will pay my friend, it will be all the same;" I paid his friend; they directly went away, and in about three minutes I examined the casks; I

             the hung, and put a gallon can under them; about half a pint run out of each cask into the can - I immediately got a ginblet, and bored a hole in the head of each cask, and dirty water came from it; there was rather more than four gallons of water and spirits together - I afterwards examined the casks, and found a bottle was fixed to the nose of the cask, and was fixed to the bung so that the spirits would come out at the bung, but not the water; I immediately gave information to the Police - I understood Casey was living at No. 14, White Lion-street, Norton-falgate; I saw<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140104"/>Casey on the 14th, by Moorfields chapel, standing by a public-house, and I gave him in charge of my waiter while I went for an officer, and when I returned I found he had got away; he was secured the same day; I saw Taylor when we took Casey, but he made his escape.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. You were well acquainted with Casey? A. No, I had seen him about six times; he was introduced to me; I did not know him as a commission-agent - he did not say it was not his liquor: we were half an hour bargaining for it.</p>
               <p>Taylor. Q. Did not you call at my house on the evening you bought the liquor? A. Yes, and saw your wife - I called in White Lion-street; I understood both the prisoners lived there; his wife told me some blackguard had been there.</p>

             asked if I knew him; I said "Yes, that is the man who sold the spirits" - I went up and collared him, while master went for an officer; Casey said, "Don't let me stand in the street, walk into the public-house, which I did;" Taylor was there, and said,"What do you do holding that man; does he owe you any thing?" I said "No, but he has committed a great fraud on my master" - "What," said Taylor, "I suppose you are vexed because you have been tricked: but we shall trick you again, if you don't mind;" he pulled out two pint-bottles, one out of each pocket - he drew the cork of one, and asked the landlord for a glass; he poured out what appeared to be brandy - the landlord said it was very good; he put the bottle into his pocket, then laid hold of Casey, and said, "Come along with me, and I dare that fellow to follow you" - I said, "If I can't hold you, I shall follow you;" I followed him with the intention of giving him in charge to the first officer I met - Taylor told me, about the middle of Broad-street-buildings, that if I laid my hand on him, he would knock me down; I saw master and an officer coming, and then collared Casey, and Taylor ran away.</p>

            , of Fenchurch-street. On the evening of the 7th I was at the Lamb Coffee-house, kept by Phillips; the prisoner Taylor was there - I am quite certain of him- Phillips was not in the way; Taylor asked Mrs. Phillips if Mr. Phillips was at home - she said No; he said he would wait until he came in: he sat down, had some ale and a pipe, and told me he had put them up to the scheme of selling the brandy to Phillips; I had called at his house with Phillips the night before, at No. 14 White Lion-street; he asked me what business I had to come there, and make a noise; I told him we made no noise, that Phillips sent there to inquire after Casey - he said he had put them up to it; that he should not have known that he sold it to Phillips if they had not gone there the night they sold it, and insulted his wife; he said he went to the public-house that the party who was not in custody used, and had put up three half-pints of gin to his score; he said that the casks cost 6s. - he left before Phillips came home.</p>

            . I am an officer. I apprehended Casey on the 14th, in Liverpool-street - Phillips charged him with felony; I detained him - he said he hoped he should not be charged with felony, and walked quietly away with me - I took Taylor in Guildhall-yard; he had been to visit Casey in the Compter, and walked with him from there to Guildhall - he said he was Casey's master; I said, "I hope you will come and get your servant out of trouble?" he said he would, but when he got to the corner he started off - I told Phillips, and in about two hours I saw him behind a chariot, and secured him.</p>

               <p>Taylor. When he came to the Compter he found me there: I said Casey was selling goods for me, and if he was in trouble I would walk with him to Guildhall - I went and waited outside - he said, "Walk in with me," and the Magistrate asked if I had been seen in the transaction till he had apprehended Casey - he said not; the Magistrate said he should bind me over as a witness, and afterwards that he would hold us to bail; I knew nothing of it till after it occurred - I went home about eleven o'clock; my wife said a person had been there about some brandy - on the following day I found Phillips lived in Lime-street, and went there to have an explanation; I waited two hours for him, and as it was getting late I returned - on the 14th, when Casey was given in charge, I said, "Does he owe you any thing, for if he does I will pay you?" he said No, he had defrauded his master; I said, "Have you any authority to take him?" he said No; I said, "Well, we may as well walk on towards home then," and in the street, the officer came and took him into custody - instead of my running away as they say, I went to the Bear, and waited two hours, thinking it might be settled.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Might he have had these things for use, and not returned them? A. I found part of my property working up for other persons; he ought not to have worked for other persons - he told me he was satisfied with his wages, and did not wish to work over-time.</p>

               <p>MR. HOADLEY. He was a coach-maker's labourer, not a coach-maker; I should not think he could repair carriages; he stated that he bought near a thousand nails and brads at the same place where he said he bought this file, but they do not sell files there; I lost some thousands of screws in whole papers, and these papers were found at his house.</p>

A young man overtook me with this bundle, and asked if I was going to London; I said I was - he asked me to take this to the Peacock, at Islington for him; he said, "I live at the George Inn, Enfield"- I said, "I do not think you do; I was there five or six months ago, and you did not live there then" - he said that person was gone away, and he said, "If you will take it, I will give you sixpence;" I said I should be stopped, and so I was.</p>

Yes; she might have gone away - I was serving a customer; the prisoner was sitting on the lefthand side of the shop, and I was serving on the right, my face was towards her - she had asked Mrs. Stubbs for the lace, and then for the handkerchiefs, but Mrs. Stubbs had just then asked some ladies to take a seat; she was about half a yard from the door.</p>

On the 14th of February I was carrying a loaf home - when I got to my own door I put down my umbrella to apply my key to the door - the umbrella opened again, and while I was attending to that, and trying to open the door, the prisoner came and offered to turn the key of the door for me - I let go my hand that he might turn it, as I knew him; he then put his hand into my pocket, and took out a little bag, with fifteen shillings and one half-crown in it; I did not speak to him, I only said, "Halloo, you scoundrel;" nor did he speak to me - I had the money safe just before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. How long have you known him? A. Since the 29th of June; there was no person near us - it was about half-past eight o'clock in the evening; I did not raise an alarm - he pulled out the purse, and 4s. 6d. in sixpences flew out of it, into the passage - I picked them up: I had been at the Court of Requests the day before, and the prisoner spoke to me then; my son had a claim on him for 17s. rent - I was to call on him that day fortnight, and he said he would pay me, but I had no quarrel with him - I conceived he was a poor man, and not able to pay.</p>

            . I am a builder - I live in Dorchester-place, and am agent to the ground landlord of these carcases. I went over these five carcases one day last week - I suppose they have sustained damage to the amount of 200l. and upwards; joists, bricks, and slates, have been taken away, the chimney-pots destroyed, and the carcases greatly demolished - I know where the prisoner lives; there is a door from her garden to the back part of these carcases - I went to her house with two boys last Wednesday; I saw the prisoner there, and said, "I understood you are encouraging these boys to destroy these houses, and loosen the timbers - I am credibly informed there is a quantity of the materials in your cottage;" she said there was no property in her house belonging to any one but herself - I told her I was confident there was, and I was going to get an officer with a search-warrant, unless the property was delivered up; I left a man to watch the premises - I went away, and returned the same day with the officer; I then told her, I should, as a friend, wish her to give up the timber belonging to these houses - she said, "Come in, Sir;" I walked in with the officer as far as the parlour-door; I then said, "Mrs. Birch, you have got a good deal of the property belonging to these houses, and I am authorised by the proprietor to require you to give it up;" she said, "O deary me, we have nothing belonging to these houses" - I turned and looked into the other parlour on the left hand, and saw, I suppose, fifty or sixty pieces of timber piled up - or probably more; I said, "This is the timber we are looking for" - she said "O no, I gave either 2l. 3s. or 3l. 3s. for them, and a load of bricks;" I said, "Who did you buy it of? you must have had a great burgain" - she said, "I bought it of Mr. Morand;" I said, "What, the broker" - she said,"Yes, he is a broker;" I suppose the value of a load of bricks and the timber I saw would be 10l. or 12l. - the bricklayer came in at the time, and she said, "Here is a man who can prove I had them of Mr. Morand; and I had some words about paying the balance of the money, and he saw it come;" she said to him, "Did not you, Mr. Milwood; did not you see it come" - he said, "I saw a load of bricks and a piece or two of timber;" I said, "Did you see all this?" - he said, No; I asked the prisoner if she had any receipt, and she said it should be given at a proper time; I said we should persevere, and she said we might do as we pleased - I begged of her repeatedly to give it up, but she refused; I said there would certainly be a prosecution follow, as the property belonged to these premises - she said it did not; I then went to my employer, and then went to the prisoner's premises with the officer, and found a large quantity of wood, I believe ninety-four pieces in the whole, also a small piece of lead worth about 2s., and some slates - I compared the timber found at the prisoner's with the remainder of the joists left on the buildings; it matched in length and size, and its being faulty at one end - it tallied in every respect, and I have no doubt whatever that it came from there - here are two pieces I can speak to more particularly; I have matched one piece to the place it came from in the carcases, and it matched to the greatest nicety - the ends of these pieces have been cut off and rubbed with dirt; I have seen boys on the carcases from time to time, (and among the rest, Barnes,) throwing bricks into the prisoner's garden.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. DOANE. Q. How many times did you go to the prisoner's cottage? A. Three times, and the first time I told her the charge, and wished her to give it up, which she refused to do; I first went on the Wednesday, and then again on the Thursday - I am aware that at auctions property is bought for much less than at shops.</p>
               <p>MR. ROWE. Q. Did the prisoner ever state that she purchased these goods at an auction? A. No, she did not.</p>

                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183302140109"/>FRANCIS KEYS. I am an officer of Marylebone. I went with this witness, on Friday morning last, to search the prisoner's house; I read my warrant to her, and told her she was in custody, and I was going to take her and the whole of the timber away - I had seen the timber there the day before, when I went to apprehend one of the persons who is to give evidence, and she then said she did not know any such person; I found more than ninety pieces of timber in her house, there was a whole van load - I examined it, and found about half of the ends had been sawed off in a roughish manner; it had been newly done, but some dirt had been rubbed over it to make it appear old;. I said to a person who was with me, that I supposed there was not much pigeon left on the tops of the houses, and the prisoner said, "Oh, deary me, I have got a piece of lead; I heard a great noise between four and five o'clock one morning; I got up, went to one of the houses, and found a piece of lead, which I have in the house" - I recollected that I had seen a piece of lead on a range, but it was then missing - I found it stuffed behind a grate; I found is a cupboard, a number of bits of wood split up - I said, "Mrs. Birch, what is this?" she said, "Only a little fire-wood, and the back of an old cupboard;" I said, "I shall take it away;" she put her hands on me, and said,"Oh, don't take my fire-wood away, it is only wood I have got to light my fire;" I said, "I shall take it, and keep your hands off, or it will be the worse for you;" this is it; when I went and said I came to take her and the timber, she said, "O Lord, what a piece of work there is about this timber - I bought it of a man of the name of Morand, and paid for it; I gave 3l. 3s. for it, and a quantity of bricks" - I said, "You had a very cheap bargain, have you any bill?" she pretended to look among some papers for it, but could not find it - she said she did not know where the man lived, but she afterwards told me where he had lived; I saw part of this timber fitted to the carcases - it matched according to my judgment.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. She told you where Morand lived? A. Yes, but I went, and he had been dead nine weeks.</p>

            . I was at the prisoner's on the Wednesday before she was taken - I was employed to hold the wood while they sawed it; the ends they sawed off were chopped up into small pieces like these.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I bought the wood of Morand for 3l. 3s., and 11s. for the bricks - I understood I was to have them free of cartage, but I had to pay for it; I was short of money, and did not pay him - he said he would bring a bill, and I was to pay him; I never employed either of the boys - they have had a bribe to appear against me; Thomas has been turned off our premises for committing nuisances, when the bricks and timber came to my house, I called Millwood, and asked him to come and unload, as I had no one to do it; he came and took the bricks, but he said he was using compo', and could not unload the timber - he said he did not think I had had a good bargain, for it was most of it decayed; we had had the sweeps on the Monday morning, and I suppose they put the lead down to keep the soot from the bricks - I have heard that the boys have thrown bricks over my premises, and I have had four sash squares broken; I have begged them to go away - the building next to us shakes with the wind, and the boys took the main rafter from them last week, and I begged them to go away; they brought some wood to my daughter - she would not buy it; they said they would make a good fire with it; I only employed the boy to cut up an old cupboard.</p>

            . I am a bricklayer, and have been occasionally employed by the prisoner - I remember a load of timber and bricks coming to her in November; I was at that time working for Mr. Griffiths - I ran over but as my labourer was mixing compo', I could not stop; I heard the prisoner arguing with the men at the gate, about 3s. they had overcharged for coming - on another occasion I saw a quantity of timber go in a cart; my brother was with me then measuring a foundation - I understand the prisoner has her cottage on a repairing lease.</p>

I live within a short distance of it; I know there are some carcases - I do not know how many; I was the person who carried up the wall in her garden - the boys were not throwing bricks over into the garden while I was there; the wall I built was composed of old and new bricks - I should think four or five thousand new bricks was delivered from time to time; I do not know of any of the joints of the carcases being taken away - I have not received any money from the prisoner since she has been in custody; I did not notice whether the timber which came in the cart was such as these - I cannot tell whether the cart had one or two horses: I did not notice the same that was on it - I should not know the man who drove it; it was a fairish cart - it was bricks that came when there was the haggling about the money - I saw some old doors among the timber that came; there were some old doors - I cannot say whether there were any slates or not.</p>
