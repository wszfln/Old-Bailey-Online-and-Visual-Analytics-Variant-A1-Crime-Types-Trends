I found my Wife's Cloaths taken out of the Drawers, and were laid, - some on the Chairs, and some on the Table in the Room. I missed 4 pair of silver Watch-cases, a Mother of Pearl Snuff-box with silver rims, and a Gold Watch-case was gone likewise. How can this be, says I! Why, says the Gentleman, it must be your Servant that has done it to be sure; I believe so too, said I, for 'twas very dirty Weather, and I thought it impossible any body should come in and go up Stairs without dirting the Room. Sometime after this, a Neighbour inform'd me, that if I would search at the Pawnbrokers, I might probably find some of my Goods: upon this, I got a search Warrant, and, Mr. Grainger's a Pawnbroker upon Puddle-Hill, I found 2 pair of Watch-cases and the Snuff-box.

These are the Things which were sold to pay the Expence of his Wife's burying.</p>

               <p>Mr. Gordon. I can't swear the Prisoner stole the Lead, or broke the House, but the next Morning after it was done, we missed the Goods mention'd, and about a Month or 5 Weeks ago, this Berry came to my House, and told me he had something to say to me about my Apprentice Riggs. Riggs as soon as he saw Berry, ran from his Work to Berry's House, to ask his Wife what Business he had with me. I got a Warrant and took up Riggs, (my Apprentice) and Berry. By their Means we found out the Prisoner, and took the Breeches and some of the Goods in his Lodging in Grays-Inn-Lane, one side of the Mattress was taken off his Bed, he made use of it for a Sheet. <rs id="t17380222-2-verdict14" type="verdictDescription">

When we were above Stairs, he told me he saw Bailiffs in the Street, and he was bewitch'd that he should come out without a Sword. Upon this he call'd a Man up Stairs and sent him for his Sword, which was brought to him, and he<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173802220005"/> aid - 'twas a good Bit of Stuff, and if any Officer attempted to arrest him, it should go through him. After this, the Deceased, Millegan) brought a Man to my House that he had arrested for me, but I would not let him go into the Room, where the Prisoner was, because he was in Wratyh, and had got a Sword I ask'd the Deceas'd if he had any Writ against the Prisoner? He declar'd he had none; then I brought them together, and they were both very friendly. The Prisoner being afraid of an Arrest, the Deceased told him, he would see him safe within the Verge of the Court, and if any Officer attempted to arrest him, he would say, he was his Prisoner already, and would deliver him safe, where he should be out of Danger. Upon these Declarations of the Deceased, they both went out of the House together; I call'd the Deceased back, and would have had him done some other Business for me, but he swore an Oath, and told me he could not, for he was going to arrest the Prisoner. I asked him if he was not afraid of getting some Hurt? He swore he would venture, and would arrest him, - so away they both went. Half an Hour after this, the Deceased was brought back in a Chair wounded, and the Prisoner's Sword was with him. I went to see him, and he told me, Hilliard had stabb'd him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not I ask the Deceased if he had any Thing against me? He reply'd, no really Sir, I have not; and Mr. Langford, said, if you have, don't expose the Gentleman, but charge him here, and I will endeavour to make Things easy.</p>
               <p>Langford. I believe I did say so. I said, I would have you both agree, and I told the Deceased, if he had any Thing against him, he must take him to his own House, and must not meddle with him in my House; but the Deceased declared he had nothing against him.</p>

When he was in the Room above Stairs, he look'd through the Window into the Street, and said, - he was afraid of the Bailiffs, and wish'd he had a Sword. Presently after this, he call'd a Man up, and sent him to Downing-Street, Westminster, for a Sword, which lay upon his Buroe. The Messenger return'd with the Sword, and the Prisoner took it from him, and bent it, and said, it was a good Bit of Stuff, and would do.

When he was in my House, he said, he had no Writ against the Prisoner; but as they were going down Windmill-Street, I call'd the Deceased back, and he then told me, he was going to arrest the Prisoner.

               <p>The Widow. This is the Writ, - I took it out of my Husband's Pocket, full of Blood.</p>
               <p>A Witness. The Deceased was sworn an Officer on the 27th of July, 1733, and continu'd an Officer to his Death.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. On the 6th of May 1734, I went to Langford's House to perswade him to take my Note, in order to his discharging one Newman whom Langford had arrested. I desir'd to go up Stairs, and while I was above, I saw a Man go by, who was an Officer in the Marshall's Court. I was not much afraid, for I did not owe 5 l. in the World; but I did not care to be expos'd. Millegan came in and told me that I ow'd Money to one Mr. Cable, and that there was a Writ out against me. I desir'd him to go to the Officer and tell him to come the next Day, and he should have a Guinea for not exposing me. He went to the Officer and spoke to him, and when he return'd to me, he told me, the Officer was gone over the Water and would not return in four Hours; and in the mean Time, he would conduct me into the Verge of the Court. I took it kindly of him, and treated him with Punch and Ratafie, promising to be grateful. As we were going out of the House, Langford's Daughter bid Millegan not trust me, for I was a dangerous Fellow; upon which I said to Millegan, - perhaps you have got the Writ your self, if you have, don't expose me, and Mr. Langford said, - no, as the Gentleman has been so civil to you, if you have any Thing against him, do it here. God strike me dead and d - mn'd, said the Deceased, if I have any Thing against him; but as we were walking past the Opera-house, 2 Men came up to him, and while I was asking him who they were, I was knock'd down, stuck in the Back, and my left Thumb almost cut off; then his Followers ran away. Such Treachery and Barbarity no Man was ever used with, and I saw no Writ, - there was none produced.</p>

            . I was sitting at a Public House in the Hay-Market, and saw the Prisoner come down the Street, and the Deceased with 2 or 3 Men following him. When they came against the Horshoe Alehouse, the Deceased took hold of the Prisoner and flung him down, over the Chair Poles. I suspected that he (the Prisoner) had received the Hurt, when I saw Blood, and I told the Deceased he had kill'd him, no, said the Deceased, the Villain has murd'red me; I saw no Sword, nor any Wound given to him, but the Prisoner's Head was broke, and he was ill used. I saw the Deceased lay hold of him, but I can't say I saw any Blow; the Prisoner complain'd he was wounded, but he got away from the Crowd, and the Deceased was sent Home in a Chair.</p>

            , Surgeon. I was sent for the 6th of May to the Rose in Shoreditch, to dress the Prisoner. He had a punctur'd Wound on the right Side under the short Ribs, about 3 Inches in Depth. I know nothing of the Scuffle. He had 2 Wounds likewise upon his left Thumb, and 2 Contusions on his Head.</p>
               <p>Langford. The Truth is this, he swore his Sword was a good bit of Stuff, and before he went out, he swore if any Bailift offer'd to arrest him it should go through him.</p>

In the first Field I met 3 Men, I took them to be working People, so I went on to the second, and there the Prisoner came up to me, and clapp'd this Knife to my Breast, and with Oaths demanded my Money. I saw no Pistol, therefore I thought I might defend my self against his Knife, till some body should come up. I told him I had no Money; Why then, - d - mn you give me your Pocket, or I'll kill you. I bid him kill me if he dar'd, - I would not give him my Pocket. Then I will kill you, said he, and up he threw my Hoop, and thrust at me with this Knife; - I thought he had run it into my Guts, but I happen'd to have this Book in my Pocket, and the Knife run against that. I scream'd out, - Help! help! for God's Sake help! but he lugg'd me down, and tore my Pocket in this Manner; I continu'd crying out, till I heard some Voices call out, - what's the Matter? I cry'd, - for God's sake stop, for I am robb'd. When he had taken what I had about me, he ran away, I follow'd him, and 3 Men call'd out to me, - don't be 'frighted Madam, we have got him. They had stopp'd him and brought him up to me; I knew him again, for I have had a perfect Idea of him ever since, and I went with them to the Spot of Ground where he attack'd me, and there we found my Pincushion, some of my Papers, and the Knife that he threat'ned me with. The Moon shone very bright, and I knew both the Knife and the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I might perhaps meet her, but not to know her in any Particular; I never laid Hands on her.</p>
               <p>Peterson. I don't know what he calls laying Hands on me, but he jump'd out of a Ditch and tore me down upon the Ground; I lay with one Hand upon the Ground, and with the other I defended my self against his Knife. When he had robb'd me he ran away; I heard him run, and he was not out of my hearing when these Men took him. I saw him as plain when he committed the Fact as I do now; I took Notice of his Face, and of his Wig, and remember him particularly. A Woman came to me Yesterday, who said she was his Wife, and begg'd I would not prosecute him; or if I did, she desired me to say, I might be mistaken in the Person.</p>

            . Three of us were coming from the Black-Lyon at Chelsea, about a quarter before 8, and in the next Field to the King's Head near the Park, we heard a Woman cry, - pray don't murder me! - for God's Sake don't murder me! We cry'd out, Help at Hand, - Help at Hand; immediately the Prisoner came running full Speed, and I ran after him and caught him. He trembled and quak'd, and when we asked him what the Matter was, he told me there was only a Disturbance between a Man and his Wife. We brought him back to the Gentlewoman, who was very much 'frighted; she knew him again, and as we were carrying him before a Justice, he desir'd me to let him go, for then he could get clear off. I did not stay to look at the Things that were found, I had enough to do to keep the Prisoner.</p>

            . I and my two Friends had been walking that Afternoon to Chelsea. We stopp'd at Mr. Holloway's House, the Black Lyon at Chelsea, and we drank Part of five Pots of Beer, and set out for London, about a Quarter after Eight. After we had pass'd the King's-Head Alehouse, we heard the Cry, for God's sake have Mercy; we call'd out, Help at Hand, and immediately the Gentlewoman cry'd out, stop Thief; the Man ran as fast as he could, and the first Witness caught him by one Arm, and I, by the other. We asked him what was the Matter, and he told us some People were quarrelling, and he was running from them. He was very unwilling to go back with us to the Gentlewoman, but we logg'd him along to her, and she told us he had robb'd her and threaten'd her Life; that he presented a Penknife to her Breast, and told her if she would not deliver her Money, she was a dead Woman that Moment. We hearing this, and seeing the torn Pocket, the Book, the Knife, and the other Things upon the Ground, we carry'd the Prisoner to the Constable's House. The Prisoner when he was examined did not own the Knife.</p>

               <p>Dor. Elliot. Last Sunday was se'nnight, I work out about 8 o'Clock in the Morning to Church; and when I came Home, People met me and told me I had been robb'd. I came Home as fast as I could, and found the street Door lock'd. I open'd it, and ran up into my Chamber; there I found the Lock upon a Box where I keep my little Substance, quite broke off. I had six Guineas, ten Shillings and Six-pence in Silver, a silver Tankard, a Cocoa shell-Cup, with a silver Foot, and a silver Ring, in this Box, when I went to Church; but when I came Home, - they were all gone; the Prisoner was taken before I got Home, and the Things were found upon him. When he was before the Justice, he own'd he did the Fact, and that he had taken the Tankard, the Cup and the Ring; and as to the Money, he said he had but 1 Guinea and 10 s. 6 d. but he said he knew where the other five Guineas were.

            . On Sunday Feb. 5th in the Fore-noon, I was sitting in my House, next Door to Dame Elliot's, and saw the Prisoner cross the Way toward her Door. He had a dirty Canvas er his Arm. I heard him lift up the Latch of her Door, so I sent my Brother (a Boy, about 10 Years old) to tell him, there was no Body at Home; the Boy came back and said, there was no one at her Door, nor in the Street; while I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173802220010"/> was making a Noise at the Boy, my Sister who was up Stairs, making the Bed, call'd to me, and said somebody was in Dame Elliot's Room; I bid her make hast and come down; she did so, and saw him. This was between 10 and 11 o'Clock; I am sure he's the Man.</p>

            . I was above Stairs making the Bed, and hearing the Noise in Dame Elliot's House, I call'd down to my Brother, and asked him if she was at Home? He told me no, and bid me come down Stairs. As I came down, I heard the Prisoner lock the Door, and saw him go into the Alley. One of his Pockets was stuff'd out, and he had a Bundle under his Arm. After he came out of the Alley, he ran down the Lane, as hard as he could. I told my Brother, - there he ran. About three quarters of an Hour after, I saw him again, and said hold of him I took him; and asked him how he could be so base, to rob the old Woman? He told me, he had met her in Stepney Fields, and she had given him the Key, to carry up a Bag of Iron Nails; she deals in Iron. However, I took him by the Shoulder, and carried him to my own Door; he begg'd Leave to go into the House, because the Mob rose upon him. When I had got him into the House Mr. Jackson got a Constable.</p>

Yes, said she, and describ'd the Man to me, and told me what sort of a Coat he had on. While we were talking, the Prisoner went by, and we ran after him. We ask'd him what Business he had to rob Neighbour Ellot's House? He said he said he met her in Stepney Fields, and she gave him the Key of her Door to carry in a Bag of Nails.

'Twas about seven o'Clock in the Evening, and I was in a Hurry, but however, I went with her into Oakley's House, and there we had a Dram of Something, - I don't know what they call'd it. When they ask'd me for the Money for it, I told them I had no less than half a Guinea about me, so I left a Pair of Silver Buttons in Pawn with them, while I went to a Baker's in Drury-Lane, to get my half Guinea chang'd. When I came back to redeem my Buttons, they demanded a Shilling for the Dram, which I gave them, and then desired they would let me go; but they refus'd and lock'd the Door, swearing they would have my Heart's Blood if I would not give them a Shilling a-piece. Rather than loose my Life, I gave each of them a Shilling, and seeing a Back-door open, I ran to it, to escape that way; they pursu'd me, and got hold of my Coat, but I got over a Wall into Mr. Hind's Yard, and begg'd of him to let me through. I was not above seven or eight Minutes in the House, - no longer than we were drinking the Dram, and all the three Prisoners were in Company together. I never meddled with any of them, but they threaten'd my Life, and I had no Civility at all from them.</p>

At last he bid Money<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173802220011"/> for one, and pull'd out 2 s. with his left Hand. I thought I heard a jingling of something more than Money, and watching his Hand, I perceived one of my Seals with his 2 s. I observed him carefully, and saw him take up another. What will you have for this, says he? I told him he had got one in his Hand already. No, he had not he said, and open'd his Hand, and there was nothing but the 2 s. I told him I was sure he had it, and desired to look into his Hat. He pulled off his Hat and Wig, and open'd his Breast, telling me I might search him. I came round the Counter to search him, and in his Pocket I found these 5 Seals; I had no sooner taken them from him, but he ran out of Doors; I got hold of him again at the Kennel, and in struggling with him I tore his Coat up to his Back. My Man and I with much ado, got him back to the Shop, and sent for a Constable to take Charge of him. These are the Seals, they are mine, and some of them I have had these 3 or 4 Years.</p>

Then I went to Bed again, and lay till Morning.

He and I went out to get something to maintain us in the Christmas Hollidays, from this Mr. Ward's House. The Prisoner got into the Garden on the back of the House, and I staid on the Outside; I saw him break; Boards from the Back of the House; then he got in and open'd the back Door for me to get in to him We look'd about the House, and took 2 Pewter Plates and a Dish, and 2 Mugs. Afterwards he went among the Fowls, and got hold of one, which he kill'd, and bid me put it into the Bag while he fetch'd more; then he got 2 live ones, which we put into the Bag, and he was going again to get something else, but the Man of the House calling out, we push'd off.</p>
               <p>Ward. The Noise of the Fowls wak'd me the first Time.</p>
               <p>Eadon. We went again to the House in a quarter of an Hour's Time, and found the Sack, (which we had thrown under the Hedge, when we ran away) safe, where we left it, with all the Things in it, and hearing no Body stirring in the House, the Prisoner went in again, and brought out a Pan, with some boil'd Meat and Broth the Meat he put in his Pocket, and the Broth he left in the Yard. When we had got what we could, we came about 3 o'Clock in the Morning to our Lodgings at Mr. Allen's, where we kill'd another of the Fowls, and had the two bak'd in a Pye for our Christmas Dinner. The other five Fowl the Prisoner sold to a Woman in Shoreditch for a 1 s. The Pewter we sold at a Pewterer's Shop, - the first Shop in Houndsditch, on the left Hand side of the Way, and we shar'd the Money between us. I have been an honest Man before, - but the Prisoner has been the Ruin of me.</p>

               <p>Whitemore Wilson. I have known the Prisoner from an Infant his Character is, that he work'd with his Father to get an honest Livelihood, - he's a Cobler by Trade, as we may express it in the Tongue. I never knew he was call'd in Question before, - but only once for a Childish Thing, - for taking a little Fruit. When he's in Liquor he'll be a little out of the Way indeed.</p>

There was no Body there but she and I, but she had got a Knife, and threat'ned me if I made any Noise she would cut my Throat from Ear to Ear. So she took the Money out of my Breeches Pocket, and upon this she got my Money. The Constable was taking a Walk in Bluegate Fields, and heard a Gentleman was robb'd, - so for that Reason he found me. I did cry out, - I begg'd of her to save my Life - she was going to cut my Throat, I can't say but I did go to sleep, but 'twas a very little Time. It was a Terror upon me, and I was really frighted for Fear. I could not tell which Way to get out of the House indeed, I was afraid of coming down for Fear of losing my Life upon the Stairs; so I went to sleep, - a-bed - yes, I was a-bed, but I was alone, and I believe I slept a little. The Constable came and raised me, - only examine the Constable.</p>

            , Headborough. Last Tuesday Night I went out with Watchmen to visit Bluegate Fields, - 'tis a most notorious Place. In the Way thither I met a Woman, who told me, a Man well dressed was fallen into Mall Thomas's Hands, and she believ'd he was stripp'd. I ask'd her where he was? She directed me to the House, and I found the Door open, between 12 and one o'Clock. In the lower Apartment I found no Body, but above Stairs in a Corner of the Room, there were Cloaths spread, and the Gentleman was lying upon them. I found him fast asleep, but I 'waked him, and after he had look'd about him a little, he got up and said, he was robb'd of his Watch and his Money. I wonder'd at his Cloaths being left, and that she had not taken them away; but they were there, and he drest himself, but he could not tell how he came there. When we came into the Street, People told us that Moll Thomas was at Ray's, at the Blue Gate. I went thither and knock'd at the Door, but they would not open the Door. At last one Coleman a Bailiff of Whitechappel Court, heard my Voice, and he let me in. I told the People of the House, I wanted Beer for my Watchmen; no, no, says Coleman, you shan't drink Beer, we have got Wine enough above Stairs. So I went up Stairs, and there I saw the Prisoner sitting upon a Bed in the Room, in a fine ruffled Smock. I told her she was my Prisoner, and asked her for the Gentleman's Watch; she told me 'twas pawn'd for a Guinea, and asked me if I had brought the Money to redeem it? I sent for the Gentleman up Stairs, and he charg'd me with the Prisoner. I desir'd him to let me know how he lost his Money and Watch, but he was so surpriz'd when I first 'wak'd him, that he could hardly speak, but when we were at the Watch-house, he explain'd himself. When I asked her for the Watch, at the Blue-Gate, another Woman gave it to her, and she put it into her Bosom; but on my threa'ning her she deliver'd it.</p>

            . I was that Night at a Place where they sell Gin; and I heard a Gentleman was lost in Moll Thomas's House; Mr. Bell knock'd at the Door, and I open'd the Wicket, thinking Informers were at the Door. I told them they had more need go to Thomas's House, and take Care of a Man that had been robb'd there, than come to trouble us.</p>

             a Watchman confirm'd Mr. Bell's Evidence, and was very particular in his Description of the House, and the Condition in which the Prosecutor was found. He deposed farther, that in the Account which the Prosecutor gave of the Robbery, he made use of the Word They, - They had threat'ned him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I had been out that Night, and when I came Home, I found the Prosecutor with two Women. He bid me fetch some Beer, and I went for 5 or 6 Pots I believe. Then he asked me to let him lie there all Night; I told him he might if he pleased, but he could not give me less than 6 d. for a good Bed. Why then, which of these Girls must I lie with, said he, I told him, Sir, if I lie with any Man besides my Husband, it shall be with you. He said he had no Money, so he left his Watch with me, I took it, and went to Mr. Ray's at the Blue-Gate, where they found me. I told Mr. Ray, a Gentleman had desir'd to lie at my House that Night, so I was come to trouble them for a Lodging.</p>

               <p>The Councel for the Prosecution having open'd the Charge, the Court observ'd that the Indictment was not laid within the Words of the Statute, made in the 2d Year of his present Majesty, Chap. 25. and which was made perpetual in the 9th Year of the King.</p>
               <p>It was farther observ'd, that the Paper produced, appear'd rather a Bill of Costs. That if it was a Receipt, it was not express'd, who received. That as it was worded, the Receipt could not with any Propriety of Construction be apply'd to the Word Costs; and that the Paper appearing but a Memorandum, it was not applicable to the Case, as the Councel had open'd it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Russel. I humbly hope these Objections may be wav'd; and that the Court will be pleas'd to enter into the Merits of the Case.</p>
               <p>Councel Defendant. I beg leave to give the Gentlemen on the other Side this Hint. - That neither Mr. Gately's Testimony, nor his Affidavits, can be admitted in Evidence. The Case between the King and Whiting, is a Case in Point; and 'tis laid down by the Lord Chief Justice Holt, that where a Person is concerned in Interest, he cannot be a Witness.</p>
               <p>Councel Plaintiff. I presume Mr. Gately is an Evidence in Law; for supposing we convict the Defendant on this statute, the Benefit of the Clergy is taken from him, and every Thing he has, will be forfeited to the Crown; by his Conviction therefore Mr. Gately loses all Prospect of Satisfaction, - 'twill be out of the Defendant's Power to make him any, if he is convicted. The Objection against a Man's being a Witness, arises from his being concern'd in Point of Witness, and from it's being to his Advantage that he should be a Witness. But when 'tis to his own disadvantage that a Man appears as a Witness, he has always been allow'd a legal Evidence; as a Man may give a Testimony to charge himself. Now in this Case, if by Mr. Gately's, Evidence the Defendant should be convicted, Gately will be depriv'd of ever having any Satisfaction. What is he doing? Why he is prosecuting a Man, to convict him of an Offence, which Conviction takes away all Prospect of his having any Recompence.</p>

               <p>Mary Kinshillug. The Prisoner came into my House, and laid she was just come off the Water; she call'd for a Quartern of Brandy, complaining she was very cold. I was drinking Tea, so I invited her to drink a Dish to warm her; I got her some Toast and Butter, and made very much of her, tho' she was a Stranger. In our Conversation, she told me she had a Brother who was a Holland Trader, and for my Civility she would make me a Present of a quarter of a Pound of Tea. Thus we passed away an Hour or two, and then she asked me, if I had a Room in the House to spare; for if I had her Brother (she said) should make use of it. I shewed her my Dining-Room above Stairs, and she order'd a good Fire to be made in it against her Brother came. The next Day she came again, and told me she was a Seventh Daughter, and had studied the Planets, and that there was hidden Treasure in my Cellar, - (but 'twas she found, the Treasure, - and I lost it.) When I heard there was Treasure in my Cellar, I told her I wish'd she could find it, - if she did, she should take what she pleased out of it for herself. Why, won't you believe me, said she, I said I could hardly think there was any; but she fell down on her Knees, and wish'd bitter Wishes if it was not true; and on Account of this Treasure, she directed me to put all the Money an valuable Things I had in the House together in a Napkin, and lay it on the Table. I did so, and wrapp'd up 16 Tea Spoons, a large Spoon, a Gold Ring, 8 Guineas, and 10 s. in Silver. Then she took a Pound of Bay Salt and a Pewter Spoon, and wrapp'd the Spoon and the Salt up together. I was call'd down to a Customer, and when I went up Stairs again, all my Things were gone, and she too. I never had any of them again. I am positive the Prisoner is the Person that robb'd me; tho' she is dirty now, she was clean then. I am sure she gave me so aching a Heart, that I could have remember'd her 20 Years. I could have remember'd she was with me 2 Days, a conjuring me out of my Senses.</p>
               <p>- Gray. The Prisoner is the Person who was there 2 Days: I was at the Door when she went out with Kirshillug's Money and Goods, when she was out of Doors, she turn'd back and desir'd me to keep a good Fire in my Room, for she was coming back again with a great quantity of Tea in 5 Minutes, and she would put it in my Room, because she did not care (she said) to trust my Landlady Kinshillug. She was call'd out of the Dining Room from the Prisoner, to give Change to a Customer below; and in the mean Time she ran away.</p>
               <p>Kirshillug. There was no Soul in the Dining-Room but she and I talking about the hidden Treasure, I left her but a very little while, but when I went up Stairs again she was gone, and all my Money too.</p>
               <p>- Galloway. I saw Kingshillug carry her Spoons and Things up Stairs, and I am positive there was no one but she and the Prisoner in the Dining-Room. I saw her come running down Stairs (after the Prisoner was gone off,) - crying out, she had lost all her Money, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>A Witness. On the 28th of Jan. I was waiting at Table, the Prisoner knock'd at the Door, I went to the Door, but my Fellow Servant coming up at the same Time, he asked her for a Basket of Dust for the Paviours. There were no Paviours at Work in the Street, but however, we let him go down in the Kitchen, and I return'd into the Parlour. Immediately afterwards, I had Occasion to go down into the Kitchen, and met him coming up the Stairs; he ran out and slapp'd the Door after him. He was no sooner gone, but my Fellow-Servant observing the Print of Spoon in the Sauce, which was in a Dish I had carry'd from Table just before, she asked me if I had brought down a Spoon in that Dish? I told her I had. Then he has certainly got it, says she I ran out into the Street, and enquired for the Prisoner, and the Men who were dressing the Lamps in the Street took him; I swear to the Prisoner</p>

When the Prisoner knock'd at the Door, I stepp'd into the Area, and saw him with Sack, under his Arm, he asked for some Dust for the Paviours. I thought to let him have a little Dust, and directed him where to find it, - I went before him and bid him follow me; as I was going to shew him the Place, I heard something hit against the Dish that stood on the Table; to the Dust, he said it would not do for him, because there were bits of Paper in it, clean enough for him, and to went up Stairs again and would not take it.</p>

She deny'd I had given it to her, and made two Women who were in the House, be search'd. They insisted upon her being search'd likewise. We took hold of her Cloaths, and in shaking them, the Spoon dropp'd from her; she said it dropp'd from some of us, but I am sure it drop'd from her, and the pewter Plate was actually taken out of the Bosom, - bent in this Manner.

            . About the Beginning of January my Husband was in Company with one Hart, a  vile Fellow, at the White Swan, in Fitter-Lane; Hart having occasion'd him to spend 20 l. I went to the House to persuade him to come Home. This Fellow, Hart, told me, I had no Business there; I said, - no! - what have I no Business with my Husband! Well; I got a Fowl for Supper and order'd it to be dress'd, thinking to entice him Home. At last he did come Home; and I told him, I hop'd he was in a good Humour now. Aye, - come let's go to supper, said he, and I thought all was over; but this Hart came into the Room, and persuaded him to go out again; I spoke to Hart, and my Husband made me get out of the Room, and would not let me come in again; so they eat the Fowl themselves. 'Twas but a little before, that I had pass'd a Fine, before the Lord Chief Justice Willes, to raise Money that he might pay off his Debts, and I was afraid of his embezzeling what he had about him, so I got to him again, and perswaded him to come Home: He told me, he would give me some Money, and he pull'd out 11 Guineas which I took, and 20 l. Bill likewise. I asked him for the 40 l. Bill he had about him, - Pray my Dear give them me, - you'll then have 20 l. behind. He had at this Time, only his Gown and Waistcoat on, and wanted his other Cloaths; I went back to fetch them, and when I returned, I found his Night Gown and Waistcoat in a young Fellows Hands, and my Husband was going to fight in the Publick Room. I knew there was a Pocket<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173802220017"/> Book in the Waistcoat Pocket, with a 20 l. and a 40 l. Bill in it, and other Notes and Bonds, so I took the Things from the young Man, and put the Pocket Book into my Bosom, pinning my Gown over it. There was a Bag of Guineas in the other Pocket; however I put the Pocket Book for safety between my Breast and my Shirt, and was going Home with it, but my Husband came after me, and stopp'd me. I said to him, - my Dear, you are foolish, - and in Liquor, and should not shew such Things in a publick Room. Then I got out of the House, and two Men cross'd the Way after me. Lord thinks I, - I hope these Men don't come after me; and presently I was knock'd down. The Blow stunn'd me, and I have since had an Imposthume in my Head, which, had it not broke at my Nose, would have killed me. I can't tell who knock'd me down, but I think it was Lovell that took me up. Lord thinks I! this Fellow has got my Pocket Book! for I found a Man take it out of my Breast when I was down. I cry'd out immediately, - my Pocket Book! my Pocket Book! and Lovell immediately ran away. I call'd out as much as my Spirits would let me, - for I had receiv'd a sad Blow on my Head, by falling upon the Stones. 'Twas about eight or nine o'Clock at Night, and the Lamps were lighted, and I look'd upon his (Lovell's) Face. In the Croud there happen'd to be an Excise-man, who told me where he lodg'd; so about a Week after, I went to the House, and his Landlady carry'd me to his Wife, who told me that her Husband (Lovell) was gone into the Country. I carry'd her before Mr. Justice Margets, and she at last told us, that she would help me to the Pocket Book in three or four Hours. I would not leave her, so after she had carry'd me up and down a great Way, we went to the Horse and Groom in St. Giles's, where I saw Lovell, and knew him again. He deny'd having the Pocket Book, and got out into the Street; I ran after him and held him, crying out, - a Thief! a Thief! he was too strong for me and got away, but this Man took him, and the Pocket Book was found upon him, by the Constable. When it was in the Constable's Hand, he snatch'd it from him and gave it me himself. There were all my Papers in it but the 20l. Note; that he had got paid. I had advertised it as dropp'd, - not stolen, for Fear I should never have it again.</p>
               <p>Prisoner Lovell. If you knew you was robb'd of the Book, why did you go out to look for it with Lights?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lowry. I immediately cry'd out, I would give any body half a Guinea, if they would help me to it again; and some People came and told me it was found. I desir'd Lights might be got, but when they came to the Place, there was nothing but some Pieces of Paper torn and thrown about.</p>

I turn'd into Hind street, and before I got half way up the Street, I heard a Cry of Stop Thief; I turn'd and saw Lovell running and crying out Bailiffs! Bailiffs! He turn'd up the first Turning, and ran round the Fish-Market. I walked up the Corner, and met him, and laid hold of him. Mrs. Lowry came up and said God bless you, - he has robb'd me of 60 l. I had him into an Alehouse, where she charged a Constable with him. The Constable searched him, and in his right Hand Pocket, (in which the Prisoner constantly held his Hand) he felt something, and told us, he suppos'd 'twas the Pocket-Book. He was pulling it out, but the Prisoner snatched it from him, and gave it Mrs. Lowry, - Madam, said he, - there's your Book. 'Twas ty'd up in a Piece of brown Paper; this is the same, - I am positive to it. She open'd it, and there was a 40 l. Note in it, N.H. 29. Payable to

            . As I was at Work in my Room at Bloomsbury, I heard a Cry of Stop Thief! I look'd out of the Window and saw Lovell turn up Soper's Row. I whipp'd up a Court and came upon him. Ingram was then coming through the Posts, so I laid hold of him, on one Side, and he on the other. When we took him he kept groping with his right Hand in his Pocket, I asked him what he had in that Pocket? Nothing (said he) that you shall see. I told him he should not take his Hand out of his Pocket, 'till I had got him into a House, out of the Mob. When we were in the Alehouse, Mrs. Lowry charg'd him with having robb'd her of 2 Bank Notes, and the Constable took the Pocket Book out of his Pocket, but he snatch'd it from him, and deliver'd it himself to Mrs. Lowry. The 40 l. Note was in it, but the 20 l. Note the Prisoner told her, was gone. He confess'd before Mr. De Veil, that he had given that, to Matthews, (the Person not taken) to get it chang'd away, and that Matthews had brought him mine Guineas and a Half out of it. Mr. De Viel asked him who had the rest of the 20 l.? He said, Matthews, and the Prisoner Staines had all the Remainder.</p>

Upon searching him farther, I found upon him a new Peruke, and 17s. and 5d. and a pair of metal Buckles. Mr. Deveil committing him to the Gate house, I carry'd him there, and found Dorrel confin'd upon the same Account. Dorrel was very desirous of being examin'd by Mr. Deveil, and the next Morning he sent for them both before him, and after Examination, Lovel was sent to Newgate, and Dorrel to the Gate house.</p>

            . On Thursday Jan. 13. the Prisoner Staines came to me in Brewer street, and told me a Friend of his had found a 20 l. Bank Note, and if I could get it changed, it would be of Service to us both. I said, I believ'd I could get it done; upon which he carry'd me to an Alehouse in Fleet street, where I saw Matthews, and the Prisoner Lovel. Staines told Matthews, that I was the Person that could get his Note chang'd. I thought I could perswade Mr. Lewis to do it for me; so we all went to his House, and I told him, if he would change a 20l. Bank Note I would pay him what I ow'd him. He consented, and Matthews catch'd up all the Money, but 4 Guineas, which Staines was to have for his Trouble, and out of these 4 Guineas I had 3, only I paid for a Bottle of Wine, and made Staines a Present of a Crown more. The next Morning I saw the Advertisement in the Daily Advertiser, and that Payment was stopp'd at the Bank. I advised Lewis to keep the Note for some Time, but the Sunday following he brought Capt. Lowry to an Alehouse in the Neighbourhood, and sent for me, and detained me.</p>

He told me 'twas a very good Note, but as I can't read my self, I shew'd it to a Man in the House, and he told me 'twas good. I fetch'd the Money, and Matthews took it all. The next Morning I asked Dorrel how he could serve me so villainous a Trick? and Mrs. Lowry coming to me, I inform'd her how to come at him.</p>

            . On Saturday the 7th of Jan. between 8 and 9 in the Evening, I saw a Man in his Shirt run along Fetter-Lane, and several People were with him; I ran with the rest, and saw the Gentlewoman fall down; I saw her when she was falling, and not before. She got up again, and the Man took hold of her, and forced her back again into the White Swan. I did not follow them into the House, but in about a quarter or half an Hour, I saw People with Lights, who said they were looking for a Pocket Book with Bank Notes in it; I believe Mrs. Lowry herself was among them. The beginning of the Week I saw an Advertisement in Lawrence's House, (the White Swan) stuck upon the Dial Case, - Lost on Saturday Night over against the Black Raven in Fetter-Lane, a Pocket Book with 3 Bank Notes in it, &amp;c. I saw Mrs. Lowry several Times that Week, and she never complain'd of its being taken out of her Bosom, as I heard. As soon as she heard of her Notes, then she said the Book was taken from her, and not before. I am a Porter, and work for Mr. Perry the Carrier.</p>
               <p>Jury to Mrs. Lowry. Was your Husband out with you that Night in the Street?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lowry. After I was got up again, and the Pocket Book was taken from me, they set a Bull Dog upon me, and I cry'd out, for God's Sake take off the Bull Dog.</p>
               <p>Jury. We ask you whether your Husband was with you in the Street when you was down?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lowry. I can't tell, - when I was down my Husband came to take me in.</p>
               <p>Jury. Are you sure it was not your Husband that knock'd you down?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lowry. That I can't say. I complain'd then that my Pocket Book was taken from me, but there was so much Mob, that my Husband could not come near me. I told them I would stop Payment at the Bank on Monday, and that the Notes would do none of them any good; I believe I said this in the Alehouse.</p>

God forbid I should, - my Husband might take it from my Bosom, for ought I know. I am a Taylor by Trade, and live at the 3d House in Plow-yard, Fetter-Lane.</p>

            , a Chairman My Partner (Brydon) and I carried the Gentlewoman from Brewers-street to Fetter Lane; when we set her down, she told us 'twas crossing that Kennel she lost her Pocket Book. Madam, says I, I thought you was robb'd of it; no, says she, I should be a very wicked Woman if I say so. I fell down and lost it out of my Bosom. At the same Time she clapp'd her Hand to her Breast, - but I can't swear whether it was her right - or her left Breast.</p>

            . I live in Church Yard-Alley in Fetter Lane. This Gentlewoman's Husband was at any House to hide himself on Account of Debts On Saturday after Twelfth Day, his Wife and he had Words, so he asked me to go and drink with him at Lawrence's. While we were there, the Captain quarrell'd with a Gentleman, and got up and shewed his Wrists; he said he was a strong Man, and double jointed; at last he threw off his Gown and Waistcoat, and gave them to a Boy to hold; there being a Pocket-Book and a Purse in the Waistcoat Pocket, his Wife took them from the Boy and ran into the Street, he follow'd her, but I staid in the House. In a little while she came in again, complaining her Husband had abused her grosly, and had dragg'd her in the Kennel, by which Means she had lost her PocketBook; she gave a Boy 2 d. to buy a Link, and she went up and down the Street to look for it</p>

I can't tell the Day of the Month, but 'twas on a Thursday, - the Day before the Court would not take Bills, - last Sessions; the Prisoner and Harris and Slowman came in and call'd for a Bottle of Wine, and after that - another. I had shewn them into a Room even with the Bar, and they asked me to drink with them. After this I went into the Bar, and the Prisoner followed me, and began to be rude with me. I had a Wrapper on, and my 2 Pockets were on the outside: I had nothing in the right Hand Pocket but a Bunch of Keys and a Moidore, which Money I missed immediately: I was sure his Hand was in my Pocket, for I felt him, but I thought he was going to throw my Wrapper aside; at that Instant I missed my Money, and I am positive I had it in my Pocket 3 Minutes before. He endeavour'd to get out of the House, but I charg'd him with the Fact, and lock'd up the Doors till I could get an Officer. Slowman got away, but I carry'd the Prisoner before Captain

            . I am Servant to Mrs. Room. I saw the Prisoner go into the Bar with my Mistress, he was very rude with her there, and in a Minute she turn'd as pale as Death, and cry'd out, - she had lost a Moidore. There was no one but the Prisoner and she in the Bar; Slowman stood at the outside of the Bar, and asked the Prisoner what he was about? She said nothing at all to Harris, but when we sent for the Watch to take charge of the Prisoner, Slowman got off. Harris was not out of the Room where they were drinking.</p>
               <p>- Longbottom. I live at the Globe Tavern in Drury-Lane; I am a Servant there, and do all the Business relating to the Wine Trade. About 5 or 6 Weeks ago, Mrs. Room sent for me to assist her, telling me the Prisoner had robb'd her. I sent for the Watch to carry him to the Round house. As we were going up Colson's-Court, he offer'd me a Guinea to let him go, and told me, if he should be sent to Newgate several other Things would come against him. I refused to let him escape, and he then call'd out, - Informers! - Bailiffs! - all the Way we went. The Prisoner is a notorious Fellow for playing a Knife, therefore she sent for me to secure him. I am no Constable.</p>

            . I know Mrs. Room, and I was at this Time in her House, she keeps a disorderly House by Report; I know no Body that will<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173802220020"/> give her a Character, and what she has sworn is as false as God is true. The Prisoner, Slowman, and I, went in and call'd for a Bottle of Wine; she shew'd us into a Parlour, and sat herself down, between Slowman and I. She sat with us a considerable Time, and drank four or five Glasses of Wine; then she asked the Prisoner if he had any Money about him? For she had bought a 20 l. Bank Note that Day for 17l. and she had no Money left? He told her he could change it, but Slowman said, it was impossible she should have bought a good Bank Note of 20l. for 17 l. Words arose, and I paid for two Bottles and was going Home. Slowman and the Prisoner would have another Bottle; I said if we must have another, we'll take it standing. Upon this, the Prisoner and I went into the Bar; and while we were drinking in the Bar, she went into the Room we came t of, and call'd her Maid; then she rash'd into the Bar again and cry'd out, she was robb'd. The Prisoner asked her, who robb'd her? You! you Dog, said she, and call'd the Watch, and we were both taken into Custody. The Constable ask'd her if she was sure the Prisoner had robb'd her? She equivocated, and he told her she deserv'd to be charg'd too. There was her Maid and her Man, and one Brock present at the same Time. The Room we had been drinking in, joins to the Bar, and she came in and drank with us, - I suppose she does so with all the People that comes into her House.</p>
