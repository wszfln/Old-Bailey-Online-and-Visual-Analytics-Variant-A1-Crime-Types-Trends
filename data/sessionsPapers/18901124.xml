                  </hi>. I am manager for Mr. Cramer, a merchant, at 1, Circus Place, Finsbury—on 1st October I wanted, as his manager, to discount this bill—I had a conversation with Mr. Engleheart about it; he introduced me to the prisoner to discount it—Engleheart said, "You can trust him, he is like my brother; I have known him long years"—the prisoner did not hear that—afterwards the prisoner said, "I have a friend in the West-end who discounts bills for 1s. in the £1, and when you will give me £5 I will give it to him for discounting it; then you will have £5 5s. for me"—it was a bill for £75—the prisoner would have the difference between 5 percent, and £5 as commission—in the evening the prisoner came to the office; I had closed, and was outside to go away; he said he came to fetch the bill—I said, "Why not come to morrow?"—he said. "I won't have it to-morrow; you will have the money at once, and I must give it to my friend to discount to-morrow"—we returned to the office—he said, I must have the bill at once"—he came into the office, and I gave him instructions in writing that he had no right to sell the bill under £5, including 5s. commission, and</p>

               <p>that he had to give me the money for the bill the next day or the bill back, and I wrote that in English—he gave me a receipt that he would give me back next day the bill or the money—then he went away with the bill) after making an appointment for next day at my office at half-past two for him to bring the money or bill back—before half-past two I was passing Leadenhall Street, and I looked in a public-house in Great St. Helen's and found the prisoner there—I said, "How stands the matter?"—he said, "I have seen my friend to-day; he is making inquiries; you cannot have the money to-day"—I said, "You must give me back the bill now"—he said, "I cannot; I have given it to my man to make inquiries"—I got neither money nor bill next day—he said, "You will be sure it win be done; I will come and see you to-morrow at half-past two, and you will have some money"—that would be on 3rd October—I did not see him then; he did not come—on 4th October I found this pencil note in my letter-box, dated 4.10.90, "I can only get answer by one o'clock to-morrow," that would be Monday, "shall see you half-past one—<hi rend="smallCaps">MARTIN</hi>"—I think that was put in the letter box on Friday after the office was closed—at half-past two when I came into the office on the day I got this note, Mr. Habish gave me a telegram, in consequence of which I went to the Strand, and after going up and down for half an hour I saw the prisoner come from a restaurant—I said, "Look here, how stands it with my money?"—he said, "Well, I have some money; will you have £40; you can have a cheque"—I was so astonished I was unable to answer him—he said, "Be quiet; I have only five minutes, if you don't take it you have nothing; I nave the bill in my pocket; it belongs to me"—he wanted to go away—I gave him into custody, and he was taken to the Bow Street Station—from there we went to Manor Lane—he said to the Inspector there, "I have some money this man says I have stolen from him, but I cannot give it to him; I have put it in my bank to save it for him; I will give him a cheque for the amount; he can go and fetch some money"—the Inspector said, "No, when you are early at the bank on Monday morning you can have your money"—the prisoner wrote out a cheque, but when I came to the bank on Monday morning I got nothing; I was told, "The cheque is stopped by Mr. Martin"—this letter, dated 4th October, was shown me at the bank—it is addressed to the manager of the Charing Gross Bank, and is "Please stop payment of my cheque, drawn in favour of 0. Cramer, for £70"—I got no money—afterwards I tried to find the prisoner—Mr. Engleheart came to offer me a part of the money—I gave information to the police—they got a warrant—I found the prisoner in Bishopsgate Street when I was with a detective; that was the first time I had seen him after 4th October.</p>

I am in partnership with my brother-in-law, and keep the Hop Pole public-house, Wardour Street—on November 15th, shortly after midnight, the prisoner came in for two-pennyworth of Irish cold, and tendered a bad florin—I said, "It is a wrong one"—he made no reply—I asked him where he got it—he made no answer—I passed the coin to my brother, and then he put a good half-crown down in the place of the bad florin—my brother came up, and asked him where he got the florin—he made no answer—I gave him in charge, and he said he lived in Wardour Street, but afterwards said in Euston Square—I gave the florin to the constable—this is it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> I threw the florin to my brother, and said, "Here, catch this"—it fell on the floor, and went right into the parlour—I saw him pick it up—the constable said, "Where do you' live?" not "Where have you been?"—you said, "Wardour Street," 109, I think—the constable said, "Go and see if he lives there," and then you said, "It is no b——use your going there, I don't live there at all."</p>

I am a painter, of 49, Lawley Street—on 24th December, at ten o'clock, I was going home, and met the prisoner, who I knew, outside the Britannia public-house at the corner of Salmon Lane, Commercial Road—he asked me for a drink—I said, "If you come down Three Colt Street, I don't mind paying for a pot of ale for you"; and I did so at Trewitt's public-house—I drank some of it and was going out—he said, "Don't go yet," and sot hold of me by the sleeve of my coat and pulled me back—I said, "Let me go, I am going home," and pulled myself away—when I got into the street one of his confederates spoke to me for a minute or so, and the prisoner, who came up behind me, Dinned me by my elbows—I said, "Marchant, I will have you for this, if you don't let me go"—he never spoke, but held me tight—there was another man in front of me—my coat was buttoned; three buttons were torn, my</p>

I am a house decorator—I lodge at 10, Hertslet Road, Holloway, on the second floor—the prisoner lived with Mrs. Smith in the same house on the ground floor—I have lived in the same house with them going on for three years and a half—I have gone into their back room, the kitchen—on 8th October I came home about 6.30, and on going in Mrs. Smith called out, "Is that you, Woodruff?"—I said, "Yes"—I went into the room, and she gave me twopence to get her a pint of beer; that was about 6.45—when I took the beer back Thomas was standing at the door—he asked me what I had got—I said, "Beer for Mrs. Smith"—he said, "Give it to me, and do not get her any more"—I left—Mrs. Smith was in the room when I gave the beer to the prisoner—I did not see her, because he was at the door, and the bed was behind the door—when she gave me the twopence she appeared sober, and spoke plain enough for me—when I returned the fire was all over—I do not think they were very happy, because I have seen her face very much bruised, and black eyes several times.</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living with a man named Cook, and have gone by the name of Mrs. Cook—in October I was a lodger at 10, Hertslet Road—I had lived on the first floor front since 19th September last year—I have frequently seen the prisoner and Mrs. Smith, who lived on the ground floor—there has been scarcely a night without some quarrelling—I have seen marks on Mrs. Smith's face and head—her eyes have been black and cut, and her mouth cut—she has spoken to me from time to time about it—she once showed me a fender in the kitchen—it was broken in two—on the fender and on the floor were blood and hair—on one occasion Mrs. Smith called me down—the prisoner was there—she said, "Mrs. Cook, would you mind cooking Mr. Thomas a steak for him "?—the prisoner said to her, "I'll make you do it"—she said, "I'm too ill, Harry, I can't stand over a fire"—I said to her, "If it is your wish I should cook it for Mr. Smith I will do so"—I did it—I went upstairs—about three months before 8th October I heard the prisoner say, "I'll do for you, but in a manner that shall not be found out"—on 8th October I took dinner with Mrs. Smith about 1.30—she had had drink—a little before seven I was in my own room—I came in about 6 30—Miss Stewart was with me—I came "down in the garden about 6.50—on the first landing with Miss Stewart I heard Thomas say, "I want some b——money"—Mrs. Smith said, "Harry, I have none"—he said, "Where is the watch and chain?"—she said, "I have had to put it away"—he said, "Where is the money?"—she said, "I have paid it away for some taxes"—Miss Stewart and I went into the garden at the back to get some clothes in—I heard Mrs. Smith say, "Oh, Harry, don't!"—I went into the passage, and up to the parlour door—that was the room they occupied—the door was open—I looked from the wall through the crack of the door where the</p>

               <p>hinges are—I saw the prisoner take Mrs. Smith by the hair of her head, and pull her to the floor—she was lying on the bed on the right side near the window—she fell on her head towards the window, and her feet towards the kitchen, towards the door—the room had a bow window—the head of the bed was to the window—the prisoner put his left foot on her chest so (<hi rend="italic">describing</hi>)—he held the lamp in his hand—he took it from the table—he lifted it—the table was not far from the bed—it was a round table—he put the lamp on the table again—in another place—nearer the bed—right at the extreme edge of the table—he then took hold of the table, and her thumbs under the desk, and pulled the table over—he lifted the table—I saw the lamp go in the direction I had seen her fall—towards her stomach—I do not know whether the table went down or whether he put it back, it seemed to tip over where she was lying, on her stomach—I rushed to the front door, and said, "Oh, Annie, he has turned the lamp on her"—I went into the street—I called for assistance—two people came—I saw no uniform policeman—I went to the second house, and returned to the gate—I saw Mrs. Smith walking up the passage a mass of flames—she got on the doorstep, rolled over, and put her hand up—she fell in the pathway in front of the house—I could not have been more than two or three minutes away—when I got in the passage again I saw the prisoner standing against the parlour door, more inside than out—I had not seen the prisoner help her—then the doctor came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I occupy one room—Miss Stewart stayed with me a week when I first went to the house, she went there with me—she lived in her own room when Mr. Cook was there, not in mine—I saw the deceased in the hospital—Annie Stewart went with me—I told the Magistrate all I said to the deceased woman was, "Was she prepared to die?"—that was all I said to her—I could not see the prisoner's face through the crack of the door—his left side and back were toward me—his face was towards the window—his, left hand towards the bed—the prisoner put one hand on one side of the table and the other on the other—he had the lamp in his right hand—the foot of the bed was between me and the table—I could see his leg on her chest; one leg was higher than the other—I did not hear him say, "I have told you I should kill you"—this is not correct: "He took the lamp up, threw it at the woman, and hit her on her shoulder"—it is not true that two men burst the door open; no door was closed—I have interfered and taken the dead woman's part; I have gone into the room to them—I did not go in this time—Mrs. Smith said, "Unless I call don't come down; he might hit you; I would not like him to do that"—at the Police Court I gave the reason for not going in that I did not like to take the liberty—that is the correct reason—I have been living with a man and gone by his name—I believe his name is West: but I did not address him as West—the man I live with is Cook—I did not say I would expose West about some leather if he did not give me some money—West promised to keep the rent paid up, and he let it go back—I said I would go down to Cook's office, a railway company's office—it was not about leather—this is not true: "Annie Stewart said something about burning some leather belonging to the railway company, so that Mrs. Cook should not split on Mr. West, and Mrs. Cook said she would expose Mr. West if he did not give her some more money"—I have been going since June,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189011240019"/>
               <p>but no particular notice was given—it is not correct to say the deceased woman gave me notice—I had not paid my rent—I had not a notice to go because of that—I said I wished to leave if he did not keep up the rent—I paid it myself as long as I could—Cook left 10, Hertslet Road the Sunday before 8th October—before that time he stayed there; he had been away a fortnight or three weeks—I looked to him for a livelihood—I had no other—I did not know of an accident to deceased's arm from a tram about two months ago, nor that she got £6 compensation—I never heard it—I told the Magistrate I was locked out the night before this occurrence—Mrs. Smith and I were out together—it was 12.10—we sometimes came home sooner, sometimes later—we were locked out purposely—I spoke about it the same night—Mrs. Smith said, "Do not say anything to-night"—I asked why the door was fastened—the prisoner said he was going to have fresh rules—that was to Mrs. Smith—I wanted to know who was landlady, I did not pay rent to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Mrs. Smith was the person to whom I paid my rent, or to whom Cook or West paid it—I told Mrs. Smith I could not keep the room on if Cook did not keep the rent paid up—I went to Cook's office to see what he intended to do, because he made his home at No. 10—I do not remember going downstairs to interfere since three months ago—that was when the fender was broken—after that Mrs. Smith told me not to go down unless she called—she did not call.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Inkle Street—in October I lived at 10, Hertslet Road—I last saw Mrs. Smith on 8th October about 1.30—we were having dinner together—she had been drinking—about 7 p. m. I came downstairs with Bennett—I' heard Thomas say to Mrs. Smith, "I want some money"—she said, "I have not any"—he said, "Then where is the watch and chain?"—she said, "I have had to put it away"—I went into the garden—then I heard a bumping sensation as if some thing was bumped on the floor—I followed Bennett to the house—she stood against the parlour door—I stood on the back-door step—she looked through the crack of the door, which was open—I heard Mrs. Smith call out, "Oh, Harry, don't"—Bennett said, "Oh, Annie, he has turned the lamp on to her," or something similar, and ran into the street—I went to the parlour door—as I passed I saw a flame—like a fire in the room—I went on to the doorstep—I turned round and saw Mrs. Smith fall on her knees at the parlour door in flames, next to the front door—I screamed "Fire!" and "Police!"—a lot of people came—I first saw the prisoner when the policeman came put of the parlour with him, and put a counterpane over, the deceased—up to that time the prisoner had not assisted her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am servant to Mr. Ransom, of 391, Cambridge Road, Bethnal Green, a clothier—on November 1st, about 7 p. m., Hazell and Holmes came in; Hazell said, "I want a 6d. tie"; I showed him some; he chose a black one, and laid down a half-sovereign; I gave him 9s. 5 1/2 d. change, which he put in his pocket, and I put the half-sovereign in the till—he talked about different things, pulled some silver out of his pocket suddenly, a lot of sixpences, as far as I could make out, and said, "It is a pity I troubled you to change a half-sovereign when I had got silver; would you mind giving me the half-sovereign back, and I will give you silver?"—I gave him the half-sovereign back, and he gave me ten shillings in silver; he then got talking about different things, and confused me, and suddenly threw the half-sovereign among the silver, and said, "Give me a sovereign, and that will make it right—in the confusion I gave him a sovereign, forgetting that the. silver belonged to Mr. Ransom—when they had gone I looked at the till and found it was short; I could not say exactly how much, but about ten shillings—about a quarter of an hoar afterwards Palmer came in for a pair of socks, price 5Jd.; I served him; he laid down a half-sovereign, and I gave him 9s. 6d. change—he got talking about his wife and one or two other things, and then said, "I wanted that half-sovereign; do you mind giving it back to me, and I will give you silver?"—I did so, but he wanted a sovereign; I picked up my silver and his half-sovereign, and recouped myself, but gave him the half-sovereign back—I went after him, and found the three prisoners drinking together in a public house, and gave them in charge—they denied all knowledge of each other at the station, or of having been in my shop—Hazell and Holmes came in together, conversed together in the shop, and went out together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> It was Saturday night, and I was very busy—I had just got rid of half-a-dozen people—they left just before the prisoner came in—I cannot swear I did not make a mistake with regard to them, but they came with paid off bills, and I think one bought a skirt for half-a-crown—the bills were in the till—I do not recollect any change being given—the people gave me the right money—I won't swear I made no mistake; it is a long time back—the public-house was a quarter of a mile from the shop—there were other people in the public-house,</p>

I live at 57, Flower and Dean Street—on 24th October, about half-past eight in the evening, I was going along the City Road and saw the prisoner lighting the lamp of the Windsor Castle public-house with a long stick—I saw the old lady, Rebecca Jenkins, standing outside—she said something to the prisoner, I could not say what, but he took the stick and hit her on the face with it; it hit her in the eye—I went on, and when I came back her eye was very much swollen, there was no blood—I spoke to her—the prisoner was not present.</p>

I am a wood and brass letter manufacturer, of 138, City Road, and have been there five or six years—some time in September Tragheim brought me a piece of gelatine with a tracing on it of "1" "0 "and a star, and gave me an order to make this as perforators through paper—he said he was getting them for a friend in the country—I asked him whether it was to be one stamp or three, as it was not traced through on the gelatine, he said he would write and let ma know the following day or the day after—he left 4s. deposit, and left and returned in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, and said that referring to his friend's letter I was quite right, and they were wanted in three stamps—I made them, and he called again in a few days and paid the balance, sixpence, and took away the stamps, the gelatine, and a piece of paper with the perforations on it like this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), to show that they were perfect—this is the punch which I made the star with—Tragheim came again the next week and brought this piece of gelatine, with the letter B on it and some figures—that is called type—he gave me an order to make those letters and figures—I did so, and he called at 6 p. m. and fetched them away, and I gave him the gelatine—he paid 8s., and I called my wife to make the bill—this is it: "Bolton, October 1, 1890. 11 type-to order, M. Sergeant, 8s"—shortly afterwards he brought back ten out of the eleven, and said they did not fit close enough together, and wanted to be filed thinner—I did so, and gave them back to him—this star, this "1," and this "0," repeated three times on these letters of credit (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) were made from the stamps I made, and I have no doubt that this "B 8,692," "B 8,693," and" B 8, 694. were made from the type I made for Tragheim—I have been in the trade all my life—these things were in the ordinary course of business, and I had no idea of there being anything wrong—they would have to be set up in a little frame to print from them.</p>

Morgan and Co., 22, Old Broad Street, the London correspondents and agents of Drexel, Morgan, and Co., New-York, and when they issue letters of credit I am advised of them—this is one of the genuine letters of that firm—when complete, the list of correspondents is attached to it, so that the holder can see where he can get the money—the first forged one is dated 18th September, 1890—for the year 1890 the proper initial letter is "C "instead of "B"—they do not change the letter every year, but last year "B "was the initial letter—these three letters of credit are forged; the colour of the "B "is red instead of violet, and I see a slight difference in the perforation of the "0"; the signature is slightly different, and so is the paper; I have weighed it—the paper of the original would be issued in New York—I have no advices relating to these three; two of them in the name of David Hope, and one in the name of Charles Thorn—the serial number is the same as last year.</p>

When you read this I hope your head will be much better, dear, I can't bear to see you like you were this evening. Try not to give way. Try to be brave, dear, for things will come right in the end. I know things look dark now, but it is always the darkest hour before the dawn. You said this evening, I don't know what I ask. 'But I do know. Why should you want to take your life because you want to have everything your own way? So you think you will take that which no man has a right; never take that which you cannot give—you will not if you love me as you say you do. Oh! Frank, I should not like to think I was the cause of all your troubles, and yet you make me think so. What can I do? I love you with all my heart, and I will love her because she will belong to you. Yes, I will come and see you both if you wish it. So, dear, try and be strung, as strong as me, for a man should be stronger than a woman. Shall I see you on Wednesday, about two o'clock? Try and get away, too, on Friday, as I want to know if you are off on Sunday until seven o'clock. Write me a little note in answer to this. I shall be down on Monday or Tuesday in the morning, about nine a. m.—So believe me to remain your most loving M. E. "Dear Frank,—You ask me if I was cross with you for only coming for such a little while. If you know how lonely I am, you would not ask. I would be more than happy if I could see you for the same time every day, dear. You know I have a lot of time to spare, and I cannot help thinking. I think and think, till I get so dizzy that I don't know what to do with myself. If it was not for your love, dear, I do not know what I should really do, and. I am always afraid you will take that away, then I should quite give up in despair, for that is the only thing I care for on earth. I cannot live without it now. I have no right to it, but you gave it to me, and I can't give it up. Dear Frank, don't think bad of me for writing this. I do hope your cold will soon go away.

My dear Boy,—Don't for get to-morrow (Friday), about 2.30.")—I did send a letter—I can't remember who the inquisitive lady was, it was not my wife—I have no notion who it was; I can't call to mind—many women came into the shop; not to inquire After me—no other woman called at the shop to see me—I did not pay any attention to that fact—I cannot call that letter to mind, I may have received it; I have received many letters from her, love letters—I did not receive letters from any other woman.

I said I could not; she then asked me to lend her some money. I said I could not lend her any, as I had but a shilling and three-half pence in my purse"—she said, "I did not tell you this before, as she particularly asked me not to let anyone know she had been"—I asked her if she would come with me, and we should go to the Kentish Town Railway Station to see if she had booked the <hi rend="italic">pram</hi>—that was in case she had gone to Chorley Wood—she said, "Wait a minute, I will put on my hat and jacket and come with you, "and she did so—I did not go further than the bed room; we then came out together; we walked to Prince of Wales Road, then she left me and said, "I will take the train and go on to Kentish Town"—about half an hour afterwards I saw her again at my home—she said she had scratched her hand in killing mice, and smeared her dresser all over; they ran about the kitchen in thousands—she stayed with me at Prince of Wales Road—I went downstairs, and Mrs. Barraud, the landlady, drew my attention to something in a newspaper—that was the first intimation I had of the murder—I went into the room where. the prisoner was, and spoke to her—I said, "Don't puzzle yourself; Mrs. Barraud has just told me of such a dreadful murder at Hampstead; and from the description I am afraid it is Phoebe"—she said, "Oh, no; Frank will bring her all right from Rickmansworth"—that is where Chorley Wood is—I said, "Will you get. a newspaper?" or she said, "I will get a newspaper," I forget which—I think she said, "I will get a newspaper;" and she went out and got one: she said, "Will you read the account?" and I took the paper and read the account aloud—it contained the account just as the landlady had said—I said, "I believe it is Phoebe"—she went out and got another paper—I read that; it was fuller; it made mention of the perambulator</p>

I am cook at 34, Hamilton Terrace, St. John's Wood—on Friday, 24th October, I was coming out of the house at half-past seven, and close to the gate I saw a bassinette perambulator—I went where I had to go, and returned about twenty minutes to nine and saw the perambulator still there; I noticed that the handle was broken; I have seen the perambulator since, this is the one.</p>

On 24th October, about half-past ten at night, I was on duty in Hamilton Terrace; my attention was attracted to a perambulator standing against the wall of 35; I went and looked at it; I found the handle was broken, there was a brown skin rug over it with a red cloth lining, I removed the rug, the perambulator was stained with blood, I took it and its contents to the station—I then found in it a waterproof apron, a piece of butter scotch in paper, and the steel part of the handle, and a piece of string—the perambulator was more closely<lb/>examined by Inspector Holland—I saw that the articles had stains of blood on them.</p>

I told Clara about it, and she said I had better not say anything about it, as it would seem a disgrace to ask for money"—she was very much agitated when I said, "I believe you saw her yester day, "and her voice trembled; she was not so calm as she had been during the prior part of the day—I was accompanied by Detective Parsons—in consequence of what I saw at the house I left Parsons in charge, and went out and sent a telegram to the station; shortly afterwards Inspector Bannister came, and I was present during the time the premises were searched; I assisted in the search, and I was present when Bannister arrested the prisoner.</p>

I told her I could not lend her the money, as I had none, and could not mind the child, as I was going out.

On the Thursday I wrote a note to her, and gave it to a boy, who was to wait for an answer; it was to invite Mrs. Hogg to tea on the Friday afternoon"—I said, "Did she come on the Friday afternoon?"—she said, "Yes, between four and a quarter past, and as we were having tea Mrs. Hogg made some remark which I did not like; one word brought up another," and she then made a stop, and said, "Perhaps I had better say no more," that was all that was said—acting on my instructions, <hi rend="italic">I took</hi> off the clothes she had on, and provided her with other garments; I gave the clothes I took off to Inspector Bannister.</p>

I said, "On account of the evidence"—she said, "Well, I would not do such a dreadful thing, I would not hurt any one"—she was wearing gloves at the time; I told her to take them off at the police-station—I noticed that her hands were very much scratched and torn about—they were seen by Mr. Bond next day—her clothes were handed to me by the female searcher; I directed her to search her, and gave her directions as to what she was to do, and the prisoner was supplied with other clothes; she was charged at the station; she made no statement there—on 30th October I went to the house again and found there a number of articles which were afterwards submitted to Mr. Bond and Mr. Pepper—I saw a pair of lace curtains in a bath in the wash-house, they were stained with blood—I made a very complete search of the rooms and also of the place outside and of the ash-pit—in the fire-place under the copper I saw a number of novelettes partially burnt; they were quite matted together with blood—all the contents of the kitchen were seen by Mr. Bond—in the dust-bin I found this button, it was among the ashes—I saw the jacket on the body of the deceased the night the body was found, one of the buttons was missing from the right arm of that jacket—this is the jacket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is in two pieces—it was cut in order to take it off the body—the button on the left sleeve is still on it; it is exactly of the same pattern and size as the one found in the dustbin—I did not take the prambulator that was found at Hamilton Terrace to Priory Street; I got one exactly like it it could certainly be taken along the passage into the kitchen; to look at it I thought it could not be done, but I wheeled the one exactly like it into the kitchen—there is a curve in the passage just by the kitchen door; it is a very narrow passage, but wider than the bassinette—I experimented with the perambulator that was found as to whether it would bear the weight of the body—one of these knives is very sharp; subsequently, on the 30th, I found this small carving knife in the dresser drawer—one of the knives is a small carver, and one is a dessert knife, that has blood stains; it is very sharp—I also found a portion apparently of a burnt hat or bonnet under the kitchen fireplace among the ashes; these are the charred remains of the outside—the hat of the deceased has not been found—the things I found in the kitchen, except this portion of the hat, have been seen either by Mr. Bond or Mr. Pepper.</p>

               <p>matter by the police on the morning of 25th October, and in consequence I went to the mortuary at Hampstead between eleven and twelve; I was there shown the body of the deceased woman, and made an external examination of it—the scalp was very much broken at the back—the bones of the skull wore fractured, and some of the fragments penetrated the brain—the throat was cut, and the spinal column was divided, so that the head was adherent to the body only by the muscles at the back of the neck and by some skin—those cuts had been made during life, or immediately after death—the skin and muscles were much retracted from the cut; that would indicate that the cut had been made either during life, or very soon afterwards, while the body was still warm—there was a bruise on the forehead, and a cut on the forehead, and I also-found on the right forearm, in front, a large ragged cut, which appeared to have been done by glass—I formed the opinion that the scalp had been first injured there was a large quantity of matted blood all over the hair, and great extravasation of blood under the scalp—I was present at the post-mortem examination made by Mr. Pepper—in my opinion the cause of death was the fracture of the skull and the cut throat—the fracture of the skull alone was enough to cause death, but I do not think it would have caused death immediately—the poker produced is such an instrument as might have caused the fracture—there might or might not be convulsions as the result of such a blow—I think there were convulsions, because the motions and faces had passed on to the clothes; that would ordinarily occur in convulsions; I did not see that, I was told by one of the doctors in attendance that that had occurred—the cuts on the throat must have been made by more than an ordinarily sharp knife—there was one fracture on the skull cap which was oblong in shape, and when I compared it with the round part of the handle of this poker, it corresponded as nearly as I should expect a fracture through a bone to correspond—on the 26th October I went to 2, Priory Street, and there examined the back kitchen—I saw where the panes of glass were broken; they were apparently broken from the inside; the fragments had all fallen on the" outside—there were splashes of blood on the panes that remained in the window—I examined the glass that had fallen outside I found one spot on a fragment which had fallen outside; but I found two spots and a little streak on the broken glass which remained in the pane that was outside—the ceiling and walls of the kitchen were splashed with blood, and the different articles in the kitchen had spots-of blood on them—it was not such blood as would be produced by spurting from an artery; they were round is spots, similar in shape to splashes of mud that you see on walls or windows, such as might be caused by striking with some heavy instrument—I took away some pieces-of the ceiling with marks of blood upon them—I saw some lace curtains there with blood on them; I took away a part; also pieces of drugget and floor-cloth; I saw blood on them at the time—I examined the poker at the time and afterwards; there appeared to be a little blood in the crack by the handle, and on the shaft there were very faint hairs adhering, as if it had been rubbed with a bit of flannel; they were not human hair; they were very small; I could hardly see them; I had to hold them up to the light to see them—the floor of the room appeared to have been recently cleaned or attempted</p>

               <p>to be cleaned, and some of the articles of clothing in the kitchen showed signs of having been recently washed—I did not find any blood in the passage; I looked in the passage, and in the front room, I found no blood—on 26th October I saw the prisoner at Camden Town Police-station and examined her hands; on the right hand I found scratches on the backs of the second and third fingers, and on the third finger there was also an abrasion of the skin—the scratches were about half an inch long—on the left hand there were three abrasions on the back of the thumb, and on the back of the little finger of that hand there was a scratch and abrasion, and on the front of the little finger opposite the last joint there was an abrasion deep and ragged—those wounds were all recent, they might have been caused by glass or any hard substance; some of them looked like the marks of finger-nails—the hands were not swollen, and I noticed no injuries about the wrists—the hands of the Prisoner were strong, well-shaped hands—I saw the bassinette perambulator on the Sunday—there was a large quantity of blood on the inside of it; I saw some hairs adhering to the lining—I examined those hairs with some hairs taken from the head of the deceased, they corresponded in colour and microscopic appearance; I afterwards examined them with a microscope of more power, and they corresponded in size, colour, and general appearance—the body of the deceased was that of a woman about thirty; I did not measure her, but I thought her height was about five feet six; that was the impression I formed—I think the bassinette would take the body of the deceased, by doubling up, of course; the severing of the head would facilitate its being placed there; it would allow of the head being doubled under or over the to-day, so as to shorten it to that amount—the deceased appeared to be a woman in good health, and well developed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I did not try the weight of the body with her clothes on; I should form an estimate it would be between nine and ten stone, that is a heavy weight—a person of that weight, dead, or insensible I do not think would be heavier than a person in their senses, it depends upon how the parts fall about—I have seen all the knives, and examined them; one of the knives I do not remember to have seen, that is the knife found behind the tea-tray in the front parlour; the others are all ordinary knives—the blow from the poker on the back of the head forced some of the skull into the brain—that must have been a blow of considerable violence, great force, must have been used to almost sever the head; to a great extent it depends on the instrument used; it cut through a bit of the vertebrae.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Master of Surgery of the University of London and am an F. E. C. S.—I was instructed to make a post-mortem examination of the body of Phœbe Hogg; I did 60 on 26th October, in the presence of Mr. Bond and another medical gentleman; I have my notes of it—I found on the left side of the head at the back part two lacerated wounds near together, each about two inches long, and beneath those wounds the skull was smashed in, and fragments of the bones had penetrated the brain; about two inches in front of this there was a smaller wound in the scalp, and the bone was broken beneath that; the brain was not injured there—on the right side of the head, near the front, was a wound in the scalp, very much like the other; the bone was not broken there—there was a very largo bruise over the left eyebrow, and several small wounds about the face, and numerous bruises on both hands and wrists, and on the front of the left forearm there was a jagged incised wound—the head was nearly severed from' the body—the cuts had been made with a sharp instrument, made from left to right, and from below upwards—in my opinion the wound in the throat had been produced during life; there is no doubt about that I think—there was no blood in the heart, or very little, just a trace, and scarcely any blood in the internal organs, showing how much had been lost from the body, showing that bleeding had gone on, which will not take place after death—any one of the wounds on the scalp would be likely to cause unconsciousness almost immediately—one of them was on the left side; the one on the back part would certainly do so immediately, because it had driven the bone into the brain—that un consciousness would very likely be accompanied with convulsions, particularly so on account of that portion of them which was injured—it is quite impossible that any of those injuries could have been self-inflicted—the wounds on the left side must have been inflicted by the person standing a little at the side, but the position must have varied with other of the wounds—as to one of them, the person must have been standing behind and at the side—it is quite impossible to form an opinion as to the order in which the blows were given—I think all of them were inflicted during life, speaking of the wounds on the scalp, because there</p>

               <p>was so much blood extravasated into the scalp, and beneath that a very large quantity of blood had been extravasated—I have examined these knives; I do not think this one could have inflicted the wound in the throat—I tried this myself on the bone where the head was nearly severed from the body; a portion of one of the vertebrae was cut off, sliced off; I tried this knife immediately above the cut place, and I could not succeed in making a similar wound—I say the same as regards this other knife—I don't think it possible that either of those knives could have done it—I think this (<hi rend="italic">another marked C</hi>) might possibly have done it, but I should say doubtful; it is sharper than the others—this one found in the front parlour I have not seen before; this is very dull except at the end, it is sharp there—I don't think that would make the sort of wound—the organs of the body were healthy, with one exception, there was a very large abscess in the pelvis, behind the womb, that had been forming for some months—that would diminish vitality, and would weaken the person very much—the chief cause of death was the hemorrhage—I also made a post-mortem examination of the body of the child—I think it died either from smothering, or from exposure to cold—I was shown the perambulator on the same day—there was a large quantity of dried clotted blood inside—there were numerous hairs attached to it, some human hairs, and some not—I compared those with some 'of the deceased's hairs, they wore as nearly alike as could be—it is almost impossible to say that they came from the same person—I examined the clothing of the child—I found no blood on that—if the child had been dressed as I saw it, it could not have been in the perambulator, unless it was wrapped up in something—the perambulator was literally covered with blood, and there was not a spot of blood on the child's clothing—a number of sealed parcels were handed to me for the purpose of analysis—they contained in all thirty-five distinct articles—I found blood on most of them—I examined the poker—I found just a trace of blood in the crevice of the handle, and in the lower part of the shaft a mere trace—in parcel number two there was a black cloth jacket said to be removed from the prisoner; on that there was a small blood spot just above the left pocket—I cut it out for analysis; all I can say is that it was the blood of a mammal; I can not say that any of the hairs were human; there was a small stain on the left sleeve—there was no blood on the brown petticoat; there were blood stains on the red flannel petticoat, and those might be reasonably caused naturally—there were no stains on the black-and-white striped petticoat—on the dark striped dress body there were blood stains in four places, washed or wiped stains; I found they were blood by the micro-scope, and, a better test still, I obtained blood crystals from them—on the white cotton bodice there was a very small blood stain in front; there was no appearance of washing; this was very minute indeed; it might be produced by a scratch from a pin; on the white chemise there were no blood stains; on this light or white grey skirt there was a quantity of blood, numerous blood spots and stains; I cut the greater part of it out for the purpose of analysis; there was a big blood spot here, and numerous spots and stains and patches on the right side and left side, and on the flounce; these all looked as though they had been splashed or smeared with diluted blood, evidently not blood intact—on this dark striped skirt there were slight stains, on the frill of the foundation—on</p>

               <p>the skin perambulator rug lined with red cloth there was a large quantity of blood, and on the apron a largo quantity of clotted blood—these two articles were removed from the kitchen, a black striped apron and a black alpaca dust coat; there was blood on both those—altogether there were twenty-eight articles upon which I found blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The articles which the prisoner was wearing upon which I found blood were the black cloth jacket, only a small spot, the dark body, the brown petticoat, the red flannel petticoat, and the black-and-white striped petticoat—on the dark dress body there were four stains; that on the white body was scarcely worth considering; on the light skirt there was a small quantity of clotted blood; all these articles were found on the prisoner—the deceased was suffering from an abscess, and was not in a very strong condition; I have heard that it was her habit to wheel the baby out in the perambulator every day; to do that a person must have fair strength—the knife by which I say the cut might be done is not jagged in any way, neither of the two knives—I should not expect to find it jagged in cutting through the bone; the bone varies very much; the part cut through is very soft and very porous; I don't think it would make any or very little difference whether it was done by a person skilled in surgery or not.</p>

I am a clerk to Mr. Colman and the London and County Stock and Share Agency Company—on 14th October I was sitting in the outside office—Mr. Colman was in the inner office—the rooms are separated by a partition, which does not quite reach the-ceiling—one can hear what is said in the other office—the defendant passed my room, called out his name, and walked in to Mr. Colman—he said, "Good morning; how are you? how is business? "and Are you going to give me that advertisement you promised me?"—Mr. Colman said, "I do not think I shall, just yet," or "just at present"—the defendant said, "You are advertising in the <hi rend="italic">Financial News</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Financial Times</hi>, and other papers, why don't you give me an advertisement?"—Mr. Colman said, "Because it does not suit me to do so at present; when it does I will let you know," or something to that effect—then the defendant asked for a loan of 10s—Mr. Colman said, I can not, as I have not got it in my pocket"—the defendant said, "You are a pretty fine fellow not to have 10s. in your pocket; I suppose the com<lb/>pany</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Defendant's statement before the Magistrate:</hi> "I had known Mr. Colman some two years before the time when I called at the London Stock and Share Agency, firstly, in the employ of a firm of respectable brokers in Union Court, after that I met him at 51, Cannon Street, when he was with Mr. Baxter, trading as Colman and Co. During the summer of this" year I received many complaints about losses from duped speculators about Colman and Co. and others. On the 4th September of this year Mr. Colman purchased from me shareholders' names to the' extent of it for which he paid me. At a later date, in October, I sold him some further sheets of names, and after writing the receipt for the account which I had of Mr. Colman, he found he was a few shillings short of what he had to pay me. It was either £1 or £1 5s. I left that receipt with him. He did not wish me to do so. At his request I called again, And that brought me on to October 14th. On that day I called up there, and Mr. Colman said, 'Oh, I have to give you some silver.' He put his hand in his pocket and said, 'How much is it?' I said I had called with some further names, and asked him if he would give me authority to his advertising agent, Mr. Skinner. I then told him I did not want the 5s., as I had a cheque in my pocket from a Cheapside advertising agent. I asked him if he knew anything about Mr. Baxter, and as he appeared very angry about the question I withdrew. I am prepared to. swear most emphatically that no request for any advance of money was made by me, nor any suggestion."</p>

               <p>made about twenty copies of one, and twenty copies of another—then I copied block letters, printing characters from a copy-book on a sheet of paper to improve my hand; it was not steady enough—it was three weeks before I saw the prisoner there—he said he had been ill with the scarlet fever; he did not write to father because he thought each day he would be better, and return to the office—he said he was going to get my instruments and drawing boards, so that I could get on with the mechanical drawing—a few days afterwards he brought compasses and drawing boards—he called me into his room, and showed me a drawing of Forbes's gas engine, of which I had to alter the cylinder, and I had to make a tracing, leaving out certain parts—I did two parts, and Wadkin, another pupil, went on with it, and I was set a different drawing—I had to trace the drawings and copy them afterwards—they were drawings of machines or engines—they were on ordinary sheets of paper—there was nothing to show whose works they were—I had to copy some schedule prices, and do quantities as to North London Railway, to copy a Great Northern Railway looking apparatus, and copy prices into a ledger—that took three or four months—I filled a good many-pages—the book was marked outside "ledger"—I had other drawings to do and at different scales—I had to draw some signal gear and some blocking apparatus—they were marked "G.

"of that name was then erased, and then it became A Wilson and Co."—fresh note and letter paper was printed with that name, and "Works, Vauxhall"—I saw Mr. Wilson, but not the works at Vauxhall.</p>

Collingridge, the proprietors of the <hi rend="italic">City Press</hi>—the boys were fairly well employed—jobs went on at North Kensington, Highbury, and Brixton—the boys helped the carpenter and the plumber, and saw how the work was done—the defendant supervised the boys' work every week, I believe—the cleaning the machines was to give them practical instruction, I should say—there were patented articles there—I took an inventory of them—there were articles for show, boilers for bath-rooms, heaters, lamps, ranges, baths, angle benders, a jemmy, and other things—also a carpenter's bench, and samples of articles, and several bath-tops—work was done which would take weeks to do—fitting bath-rooms needs skilful work—in accordance with instructions, I cut out a number of advertisements of works to let—negotiations were entered into about them—the advertisements were submitted to the prisoner—Mr. Putman, of Mild may Park Works, brought particulars of his premises, which I gave to the defendant—the defendant told me he was in negotiation for premises at Kentish Town—I heard of some works at Horselydown, near Bermondsey—I kept a diary—the defendant was looking about for works, I understood—during the first three months the boys did not complain to me—the name "North, Nash and Co.

                  </hi>. I live at 14, Maud Road, Plaistow, and am a clerk in the Great Eastern Railway, cartage department—on 14th October, about eleven a. m., I handed Tresidder, Messrs. Macnamara and Co. 'scarman, orders for collecting certain goods; among them were orders for ten pockets and a bag of sugar at St. Bride's Wharf, Wapping, and two half cases of prunes and a hogshead of sherry from the British and Foreign Wharf, Upper East Smithfield—about six o'clock the same evening Tresidder came back without his van and complained of the loss of it.</p>

                  </hi> I am a carman in Messrs. Macnamara and Co. 's employment—on 14th October I went with a one-horse van to St. Bride's Wharf about four p. m.—I there obtained some sugar on these orders—I then drove to the British and Foreign Wharf, arriving there at a few minutes to four—I went into the office, and handed in the order for two half cases of prunes—my van was outside the office from four till five—I was outside all the time except when I went in first to lodge the order—I saw Godfrey and Sharp there for about that same hour—about five I got up in my van, and drove to Birr Street, opposite the wharf, in the direction of Nightingale Lane—as I drove off I saw Godfrey and Sharp following behind the van on the footway—half-way up Birr Street Fitch came up and called out, "Stop"—I drew up—he asked me whether I was going back to the Great Eastern Station; I said, "Yes "he asked me to give him a lift, as he was going back to the station with orders—I believed that, and consented—when I got to the King George public house, at the corner of Birr Street and Nightin<lb/>gale</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189011240108"/>
               <p>Lane, Fitch asked me to have a drink—I was wearing spectacles—I said, "Yes," and drew up the van at the opposite corner to the public-house, and I left it unattended while I went in with him—he called for mild and bitter for me and a small <hi rend="italic">lemon</hi> for himself—he said he thought the <hi rend="italic">lemon</hi> was rather small for the money, and entered into conversation with the <hi rend="italic">lady</hi> who served it—that took a little time; she filled it up with some ale—he drank it, and then said he wished to go outside to make water, would I stop for him?—we had been in the public-house three or four minutes—he went out by the door at which we had corns in, and from which he could see whether the van had gone—I waited about two minutes for him, just time enough to drink my ale—he did not come back—I went out by the same door, and my van had gone; Fitch was nowhere to be seen—I went at once to the police-station, and reported the matter about 5.30, and I reported it to my employer on my return home—the goods were consigned to Mr. Wilmot—this is a plan of tie locality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> This Tuesday was the second day I had driven for my employers—I am a clerk, but recently I took to the occupation of carman—this was the first time I had been to the British and Foreign Wharf—I come from the country—there were about fifteen other vans waiting there, I should think—about twenty-five or thirty men and van boys were waiting about by the vans—I had no van boy—I did not notice more than twenty-five men waiting for employment and hanging about—all those I saw were strangers to me; the two men I saw, and who I say were Godfrey and Sharp, were absolute strangers to me; and so was the man who took me into the public-house—he was in my company about five minutes—I had no reason for noticing the men I saw outside the wharf, and who followed me; no one was by them—they were under my observation all the time I was there; I was by my van—I saw them when they were charged at the station—I am still in Macnamara's employment; but I am not acting as carman, I am in the office.</p>

I am the wife of the manager of the King George, at the corner of Birr Street and Nightingale Lane—about 4 p. m. on 14th'October, Tresidder and Fitch came in—mild and bitter and a small <hi rend="italic">lemon</hi> were called for—the <hi rend="italic">lemon</hi> was rather short, and I said I would give him a drop of ale to make it up—that took a few minutes then Fitch left, and a few minutes after Tresidder left—Fitch was the man I served with the <hi rend="italic">lemon</hi>—next morning the police spoke to me about it—I was taken to the station, and I picked Fitch out from other people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I only went to the Police-court once, that was on the remand, and then I gave evidence—I picked out Fitch the first day I went to the Police-court, and that was two or three days or a week before I gave evidence—I cannot say I had ever seen him before he came in with Tresidder—he was three or four minutes in my place—other people were serving, and there were other customers in the house; I had to do part of the serving them—at the Police-station I saw men of all sizes, ages, and complexions in a row—I had given the police on the 5th October a description, as well as I could remember, of the man I had seen with Tresidder—I have not the slightest shadow of a doubt Fitch</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman, of West Ham Road, Leyton on 14th October I was employed by Mr. James, of Bow—about 5 p. m. I had to go to Miller's Wharf, which is next to the British and Foreign Wharf—while there I saw the three prisoners standing together at the public house at the corner of Birr Street, nearest to the wharf—I noticed Messrs. Macnamara's van standing in front of the British and Foreign Wharf—a short time after that it had gone; I did not see it go—I saw Fitch go down Birr Street, and Sharp and Godfrey behind—I lost sight of them for a moment; I was going up the street—afterwards I got up on my van and drove up Birr Street and into Nightingale Lane, passing the King George—in Nightingale Lane, about two minutes' walk beyond the King George, I saw Macnamara's van—Sharp was driving it, and Godfrey was on the pavement, a little way behind—when the van got near the top of the lane, Godfrey, whom I knew as Winch, jumped on behind, and they drove away with the van—the places marked on the plan show the spots where those things took place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I have been working for Mr. James on and off for seven years—I have worked for Tingle and Jacobs—they charged me with embezzlement: the Magistrate discharged me without a stain on my character—I did not go to see Tingle and Jacobs afterwards—I was not charged with driving off with my masters' horse, intending to dispose of it—I took the horse and van out one holiday time, the foreman gave me the privilege of doing so, but he did not "let the governor know he had done so—I was stopped and had to come back—my master sent for me next morning and kept me in his employment—I know the three prisoners—I knew Godfrey and Fitch by sight and by name, but I never spoke to them—I have known White the detective some time—I have been in Court with him before—on a former occasion I saw something and gave evidence of it—I keep my eyes open—I saw him about the port wine-before the 14th—on 15th I saw him in Leman Street—he did not know I had heard of this; be said good morning, and then I spoke to him—I knew Sharp well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I was in the same service as Sharp for some time, and knew him perfectly well—I have no doubt whatever he was the man who was loitering outside the public-house, and driving the van—the other two prisoners I had known by sight. and name for some time, and I have no doubt I saw them—the charge of embezzlement was made against me over a year ago—since then I have worked for Messrs. Fairclough, doing odd jobs for seven months, and I was employed by Mr. Samuel George and then by Mr. James of Bow—I saw White about the time of the port wine matter, which was about a month before 10th October—that was a robbery of port wine from a van which was carried off; just such another robbery as this.</p>

On 28th October I was with Sergeant Cumner, and my attention was attracted to Godfrey and Sharp—in consequence of what I saw them do they were both arrested—on 29th they were brought before the Magistrate and remanded—after the remand I saw Fitch outside the Police-court speaking to some women whom I knew as friends of Sharp and Godfrey—I went up to him, he made off when he saw me coming—I went after him—as I came up to him he, said, before I touched him, "I can prove where I was the day the wine went"—there had been a port wine robbery in the neighbourhood—I said, "I shall take you into custody on suspicion of stealing a horse and van containing a quantity of sugar in Birr Street, on 14th October, and also stealing a van containing wine"—he said, "I can prove I was at the Tilbury depot the day that the wine went, and if you go there you will find what I say is true"—that was in August—I took him to the station, where he was charged—in his trousers pocket was found £4 10s. in gold, loose, 1s., and some coppers—these two pieces of paper were taken from his vest pocket, "Beans, £3 2s; Cordmans, £1 9s"—he was afterwards identified by some witnesses—on 12th November, Godfrey and Sharp were charged on the charge sheet with this offence—they had no opportunity of answering it.</p>

I am a registered medical practitioner, and live in North Street, Wandsworth—on the evening of 21st June last Mrs. Lambert came to me—she complained of having been assaulted—I examined her—she was bruised on the left aide of the head, there were two or three bumps there; and there was a slight bruise just below the euciform cartilage, slightly to the left of the blade-bone; there was extreme tenderness over the left side, and right round, but there were no marks there—on further examination I found that she had a diseased heart, and she was suffering generally from shock, a somewhat severe one—I prescribed for her, and sent her home—on the 23rd June I saw her at her own house—I considered her then in a critical condition, still suffering from shock; she had not got over it to any extent; the heart was in much the same condition—I attended her off and on until 16th October—she was better at intervals, and would then got almost as bad as ever—when I left attending her on 16th October she was better than she had been—I did not see her again till after her death—the assault described would fully account for the state I found her in on 21st June—but for the assault she would have been able to attend to her household duties as before—I was present at the post-mortem, and saw the condition of the heart—an assault on a woman with such a heart would cause actual bodily harm.</p>

On the morning of the 7th November, after I heard of the death of Mrs. Lambert, I charged the prisoner with having caused her death—I said, "The Coroner's Jury have returned a verdict of manslaughter, and you will now be charged with causing her death by striking her on the head and chest on 21st June"—he said, "I don't know as I struck her on the head and chest; I know I pushed her, and she went up against the lamp-post, it is a bad thing for me and my wife and children too; she broke her umbrella over my head and made it bleed. What had I better do, sir?"—I said, "If you wish to make a statement, I will take it down, but it maybe used against you"—he then said, "I will say what I have to say when I get into Court."</p>

I said, 'You are wonderfully quick round here; if you had stopped a little while you might have had some sent round. 'She said, 'We pay our rent, and you must pay yours, what you owe. I said, 'If you had given me time you would have had it. 'She got into a passion, and flourished about her umbrella. I shut the door and went in; and I went out and told her to go away. She got excited, and poked her umbrella. I caught hold of her shoulders; as soon as I let go she hit me across the head with her umbrella, and I found blood running down my face. She was poking her umbrella again, and I said, You bitch. 'I don't know if I struck her then. I went in doors and she went away."</p>

               <p>the bar parlour—he was anxious to obtain a case which contained knives and spoons, and so that he should not use it I put it into a bag—I examined it, and saw that it contained forks and spoons—I did not see him take anything out of it; we watched him most minutely; he put the case into a bag, tied it up, and said that he was ready to go, and the sergeant led the way out of the doorway, followed by the prisoner, who said to the sergeant, "You b——, I will give you this; I will rip you up"—we were going to the station then; Bray followed, and the woman followed, and I was last—the moment I got outside, Allen made use of a second threat, and said, "You b——I will rip you up"—I saw something in his right hand and thought it was a knife; he turned towards the constable Bray and then to me, and I thought it was a fair opportunity to knock, the knife from his hand, and struck him against the muscle of his right arm; and the moment I did that he struck me on my hat and severed one of the arteries of my head above the ear, which bled profusely—I seized him by his right arm; he struggled and used fearful threats to rip me up—the knife was in his hand, and I had got him by his cuff, and he got hold of the other hand, trying to rip me up—the sergeant drew his staff and struck the knife, and after using his staff two or three times he succeeded in knocking it out of his hand—the prisoner was then secured by the cuffs—he used fearful threats, and said, "You b——, I will remember this when I come out," and he threatened to kick our f—guts out, and made a rush in the direction for that purpose—I struck him across the head to prevent him from kicking me—he was subsequently taken, and was conveyed to Guildford—I took a cab and went home, and had my wounds dressed by a surgeon, and I have been off duty ever since—I was seriously injured; I lost a great quantity of blood, about two quarts—I produce a knife which was knocked out of the prisoner's hand close to the urinal.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The policeman arrested you outside the door, and took you back upstairs—I did not see a knife in Mrs. Jefferson's hand—she had no power to take one, she had hardly power to move—I did not see her strike you, I do not think she was able—she followed you downstairs, but the policeman had hold of her; I do not think she had power to hold anything, for loss of blood—I did not hear her call you names—I do not know whether she had bad any drink that morning.</p>

Mrs. Cross called me, and I went with another constable to the house, and saw the prisoner fifteen yards away, with a crowd round him—I took him back to the house; the prosecutrix was standing on the doormat bleeding very much from her head and face—someone in the crowd said that he did it with a knife—I asked the prisoner where the knife was—he said, "Upstairs"—I took him up to the first floor front room, and searched and found this black-handled table-knife tying under a broken washhand basin—it is bent from a blow—blood and hair two or three inches long were hanging to it—the prisoner had a slight scratch under one eye, as if from a finger nail, but</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon of Guy's Hospital—the prosecutrix was brought in on November 10th, suffering from loss of blood and faintness—there were three wounds, each about one and a half inches long, on the scalp, running parallel to one another from before backwards, nearly extending down to the bone—there was another incised wound in front of her right ear, extending vertically downwards three inches, and the skin was undermined two inches forwards, making the wounds very nearly communicate with one another—she was bleeding, and she has suffered the loss of a considerable quantity of blood—the wounds were not particularly dangerous, but if they had been a little deeper it would have wounded the larger vessels, and might have been fatal—the wounds might have been inflicted with this knife, but I should have expected it to be sharper.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I can see the remains of a cut on your right hand; that might be done by a pin or any sharp instrument—the wound on the prosecutrix's left ear may have been caused by your closing with her with a knife in her hand, and pulling it down—the three wounds on her head were parallel with one another, and it would be difficult to explain that by her falling against a box with a piece of iron protruding, unless she fell three times, or unless there were three pieces of iron.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, slated that the prosecutrix had persuaded him to leave his work at Woodford, and go and live with her in London, as they had</hi> £20 <hi rend="italic">to the bank, partly her savings, partly his. That he lost his cab licence and went to Scotland Yard for another, and when he returned she had disappeared, and the house was empty, and he was left without food. That he found her the next morning, and asked her why she had left him, when she scratched him with her nails and struck him with a brush, and then picked up a knife and struck him on his hand with it, causing it to bleed; and when she raised her arm to strike him again he pulled it down, which caused the wound on her hair. That she attacked him again several times with the knife and the brush, and as hit life was in danger, he pushed her down each time, and her head came against the bedstead, and twice against a box, and once against a table.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a printer, of 12, Carpenter Street, Westminster—on September 28th I was one of a pleasure party on an excursion from London to Egham on the Thames—we arrived at the Catherine Wheel Hotel after one o'clock, and had dinner there, after which I proceeded along the towing-path with my party as far as Egham Lock—we got there about 4.30—my brother was my sole companion, all the others were neighbours—Edward Birch, David George, and William Bloomfield were in the party, and also the man who was shot, who I knew by the nickname of <hi rend="italic">Jos</hi>; I found out that his name is Josling—when we were returning to the Catherine Wheel to have tea we met the prisoner and a woman, whom I have since heard is his wife, and Mr. add Mrs. Crutchley—I did not see Edward Birch do anything, but there was a row going on with the prisoner's wife and Amelia Martin—there were two or three of them in front of us, and by the time the men arrived the row had commenced—the prisoner tried to pull his wife away, and I saw Birch and the prisoner struggling together, and then Mrs. Nava came up, and the whole three of them went down in the ditch in the scuffle—Birch and Nava were separated, and got out of the ditch, and then I saw the prisoner balancing a thick stick in the air as if to keep anybody from coming near him—I did not hear him say an'-thing then—he then threw the stick into the Thames—it was his' own stick—I got it out afterwards—we were walking towards Windsor at the time this occurred, not towards London—the prisoner then took up a position, standing like this, with his right hand behind him, and said, "Stand back, or I'll fire"—he was standing near where this ash tree is at the edge of the towing-path by the water's edge; he was facing the boathouse, but looking from London towards Windsor, towards the crowd—her pulled a revolver out—my attention was then called by Amelia Martin, because she wanted to go into the row, as she was not satisfied, and directly my back was turned I heard the first report, but did not see it—I turned round sharp and saw the prisoner fire a second shot, and then a third towards the ground—he pointed the revolver the second time level with his arm towards the ground, and the third was towards Amelia Martin, but pointing to the ground—he was taking aim for a fourth shot, and I rushed up and knocked him across his hand with a stick which I had with me, and he dropped the revolver at once; he tried to pick it up again, and in the struggle which followed he bit my finger very severely—a man named Clark came up and picked the revolver up, opened it, and took out the few remaining cartridges—he was supposed to belong to the prisoner's party—three chambers were discharged and two charged</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189011240127"/>
               <p>—I afterwards saw that Josling had been shot below his shoulder near the elbow—he was bleeding very profusely—I went and obtained two constables and an inspector; we went after the prisoner and found him on the high road near Staines Bridge; I charged him with shooting at and wounding one of our party—ho said he had been assaulted by about twenty men; he was with his wife and two friends, Mr. and Mrs. Crutchley, who had been assaulted, and he fired in the air to frighten the crowd—I was standing at the side of the ditch at the time, about fifteen or twenty yards from the tree, towards Windsor, and could see distinctly all that took place as far the shooting was concerned—this is the stick the prisoner brandished, and this the revolver.</p>

We were walking in the same direction as Mr. Bollatsch; we were in front of him, walking from the lock towards the boathouse—we had walked up and down—after I was struck by Mrs. Nava I returned the blow and hit her, and then she hit me again—none of the men came to my assistance; I then received A blow between my shoulders from one of the men, and Mr. Birch came up and put me aside and Mr. Crutchley on the other side—Mr. Crutchley said, "What has it to do with you?" and struck Birch, and Birch struck him back, and those two got talking and the woman left me with Mr. Birch, and in the struggle we all fell to the ground, and Mr. Nava got up and walked a few yards away from me and pulled a revolver from his pocket and fired—I saw him do that; I stood in front of him—we all got up, and then we fell down again—when the revolver was fired, I believe Mr. Birch and Crutchley were still lying down—Mrs. Nava was standing on the left side of Mr. Nava when the first shot was fired—it seemed to me that he fired the first shot towards the crowd; I mean towards Birch and me and Mr. and Mrs. Crutchley—I should think there were twelve or fourteen people in the crowd on both sides; both parties were together then—while the women were fighting the men were round us—the second shot was fired soon after the first—I saw the prisoner fire three or four times—I did not fall down again after the shots were fired, or while they were being fired—I saw Mr. Bollatsch knock the revolver out of the prisoner's hand—when Mrs. Nava struck me, Mrs. Birch spat in my face—Mrs. Crutchley is a very big woman.</p>

               <p>—it is untrue to say that the prisoner came back after the row began—the three women were Mrs. Birch, Mrs. Nava, and Mrs. Crutchley—I heard no screaming or cries of "Murder," or cries of "Bill," or "Help," or 11 Police"—I had my senses about me, and knew perfectly well what was going on—as to strong language, one party was as bad as the other—I did not use bad language; I submitted to being struck quietly—the tall man is Crutchley—I was first examined before the Magistrates three weeks afterwards; I went there, I believe, because an inspector went to Mr. Bowlash, and Mr. Birch brought a letter addressed to Mr. Bowlash telling him to come—I knew that I was coming on behalf of Josling—I said before the Magistrates, "I had no idea I should be called as a witness"—that was three weeks after the occurrence—I did not know there was a summons out—I knew that Nava was in prison, but I knew nothing of the proceedings till Birch came to me—I had talked the matter over with my friends I knew I should have to give evidence at some time—I made no statement till I went to Chertsey three weeks after the occurrence—when Birch came to-see me I did not know he was a witness, but he said that they would all have to come up to the Court—I had made no complaint to the police before then of having been abused in this way—I did not ask Birch why I was to be a witness: he showed me the letter and said that I was to appear—I did not know that Birch was summonsed to the Police-court by the prisoner; I understood it was only to attend—he did not tell me that he was summonsed for assaulting Mr. Nava—if anyone says that we were twelve in party that is not true—we passed by Egham Lock; we were walking up and down, and we went into a public-house at the end of the walk; there were only four of us then, and there we met the others—that was not the first glass of ale I had had—we came down to have a good day, but not of drinking—I did not see the lock-keeper at Egham—if he says that we were riotous that is not true—the men were in front and the others were walking on—we were not playing with each other—we had not been pushing each other into the river—it was Mrs. Josling's baby, and it was in Mrs. Birch's arms—Mrs. Crutchley was not knocked down; she was not touched at all—I did not see Mrs. Nava struck except by me—I saw her lying in the ditch, and I was with her—I did not see her kicked—four of my party are going to be tried for assaulting Mrs. Nava and for assaulting Mrs. Crutchley—I saw Mr. Crutchley's face, it was in a very bad condition; he struck Birch, and Birch struck him back—Birch was hurt", but not badly—I never saw Mr. Nava kicked; as soon as he had fired he ran away—he never said any thing after the first shot was fired; he stood still exactly in the same position—the shots were immediately one after the other; I was in front of Mrs. Nava—I was not on the ground; Mr. Bollatsch was by Mrs. Crutchley—Birch and Crutchley were on the ground—no woman was on the ground—I never saw Nava move from the first shot to the third—I should say he did not go away backwards from the crowd after the first shot, but in the excitement it is difficult to say, I cannot say that he did not.</p>

               <p>Lane—on this Sunday I was in a boat on the Thames near the narrow cutting going down to the lock—the weir goes on one side, and there is a dry strip of land separating the weir from the lock—it was just before we got into that cutting, we were not in the cutting—the distance from the lock to the bungalow is about seventy-eight yards, my boat was just hero (<hi rend="italic">Making a mark on the plan</hi>)—I was midway between this bungalow and this land, going in the direction of Egham; drifting—at that time my attention was called to a crowd on the bank, they appeared to be a boisterous party engaged in horse-play—the first thing I saw was Nava and another man rushing at the crowd with a stick in his hand, and ho battered it down three or four times overhead; I could not see who he hit—whether anybody hit him with their fists I cannot say; I should think so, for there was a general scuffle, and then somebody seized the stick and tore it out of his hand, and threw it into the river, as far as I could see—ho then ran away a few yards from the place of the scuffle, and was attacked by three or four men, who got him down in a ditch, and beat him over the face and stomach brutally—I cannot say whether that was before there had been any firing—when I was before the Magistrate I could not say whether it was before or after, but I have been told it was before the firing, I cannot decide in my own mind—I did not see any women approach him, but he was only a yard or two from the general <hi rend="italic">melee</hi>—a very large stout woman followed him, and another woman who I have seen in the witness-box since, and the stout woman got in the way of Martin, and those two women began to fight, and a smaller man ran in, and the three of them all rolled into the ditch—the prisoner was not in that scuffle, he was in the hedge—I cannot exactly say whether those three persons were actually standing up or getting up when the prisoner produced a revolver—I cannot be certain whether it was before or after the shooting that I saw the three or four persons in the ditch; I said the same before the Magistrates; of course the crowd were moving, and he pointed the revolver, to begin with, on the crowd, but he did not fire; then he raised his hand, and fired right in the air; that was the first shot—the crowd had not moved from the. time he presented the revolver the first time; I do not mean that the individuals in the crowd had not moved, but the crowd had not advanced; he then brought his hand down and fired three more shots into the crowd—I think there were four shots fired; after he fired in the air he dropped his hand—I do not know where he got the revolver from; he fired into the air first, and then dropped his hand, and fired one, two, three into the crowd—it is a five-chambered revolver—those shots were fired rapidly one after the other, all of them—with regard to the number of shots I only say what I believe, but I happen to know that there were two unfired shots in the revolver, because I saw it afterwards; it was pointed out to me—I cannot remember whether any one was in the ditch or on the ground at the time the shots were fired; nobody was within ten yards of the prisoner at the time—I did not see the pistol knocked out of his hand by some one with a stick after ho fired; I only remember him running away towards the lock after that; no one ran after him; they did not pursue him properly, and he got away—I did not see the man who was wounded till afterwards; we were paddling towards Windsor, and head that somebody had been shot, and we got out and found a man lying on the bank with a handkerchief</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Police Inspector</hi>). I am stationed at Egham—on 28th September, a little after five o'clock, I received information, and went to the towing-path at Egham, near Staines Bridge, and found the prisoner there, and near him were Crutchley and two women—I cautioned the prisoner, and charged him with firing a revolver, and shooting a man in the armj he replied, "I have not shot any one; I shot three times</p>

I am manager of Ashby's brewery—I know the sailing club at Egham—I was there on Sunday afternoon, September 28th, at the window looking down the river, which gave me a full view of the towing-path and all that went on there—the club has a boat-house on the Surrey side of the river—I had been there about an hour and had seen some of the prosecutor's party—they were rather larky—the prisoner and his party were sitting quietly on the grass close to the sailing club—there were two women and a baby sitting on the grass on the London side of the boathouse—I did not notice the prisoner's party get up and walk down the river—it was between four and five</p>

               <p>o'clock when I saw them sitting on the grass—later on my attention was called to a row—I was looking out of the window at my boy sailing a boat on the river—the disturbance was going on 25 or 30 yards from the sailing club—I have not measured the distance—I am a member of the sailing club, and know that locality perfectly—the crowd appeared to be all scrambling to get into the centre, where something was going on, and then a shot was fired, and after that I saw a woman thrown into the hedge—I won't be positive whether it was before or after the shot; I fancy it was after—I did not do anything—I saw the crowd separate, and one man going down the towpath towards the lock—I cannot swear to him, but as far as I could see he was the prisoner, and then I saw several others rush at him again—this appeared to be a second attack, and then he fired another shot, and then I came downstairs and went along the towing-path, and came up to what remained of the crowd—while I was at the window I saw a stick being used distinctly, and after wards I saw the stick being taken out of the river—I cannot say by whom it was used, because it was above the people's heads—I saw a very serious attack made on the prisoner and his party; I had especially noticed them—I have distinctly recognised one of them since—the attacking party were five or six to one to the other party. (<hi rend="italic">Birch and Ballatsch were here called into Court</hi>)—I saw those two men in the attacking party—I should describe the attack as a very serious one when I saw the way the woman was thrown about—that was quite sufficient to make it a serious attack—she was thrown head over heels into a hedge—I have since been told who she was—she was attacked by the whole crowd, it appeared to me. (<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Nava was here brought into Court</hi>)—that is the woman—if I had been attacked in that way I should have done my very best to fight my way out—when the prisoner ran away his wife was somewhere near, but they were all in a line, and it is difficult for me to say their position—the first shot was fired at an angle of about 45° in the air—it would go over the heads of the crowd—the second shot appeared to be fired in the air too—the first and second shots were fired in the direction of the river—the second was over the river—some of the crowd might be between the prisoner and the river—I do not think this revolver is of English make—it is not Smith and Weston's—the crowd was scattered about all over the shop—I saw the wounded man—I dressed his arm—I said that I would have fought my way through, because my attention has been called to the conduct of bean-feasters generally, and a short time ago one man was kicked to death by them.</p>

I am warehouseman to Mr. Watts, of Myrtle Street, Hoxton—I was one of Nava's party to go to Egham—we went to the sailing club, and were going back to Egham to tea—I was walking with the prisoner, and the others were twenty yards behind—I did not notice that we passed any people on the towing-path, but when we got some distance I heard someone holloa out "Bill," and they were behind me—I was talking, and did not notice—I looked round and saw Mr. Nava with a crowd of men, and he went over, and as soon as he got over he was pushed and knocked about by Birch, Bollatsch, and David George—I identify them as having struck him—he struggled and got out of the crowd, and his wife was struck by a woman, and after that by Birch, and knocked down, and as fast as she got up she was knocked down again—there were about twenty there—Mrs. Nava got up several times, and every time she got up she was knocked down again and kicked—Nava holloaed out, "You cowards, knocking two women about like that," and he drew his revolver and said, "Stand back, or I will fire"—it was empty then; it was not loaded—they took no notice; they still kept on knocking the women about, and after that he loaded it and said, "Stand back, or I will fire," and then I saw him fire a shot—he held his revolver up in the air, and a minute afterwards I saw him fire another one, and I ran for assistance, as I saw they were not afraid of the shots, and then I heard a third shot; he fired that in the direction of the water, right opposite to them—Mrs. Nava was then lying on the grass in the middle of the crowd calling out, "Bill, Bill, I am being murdered."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When he fired he stood about a yard off the towing path; he fired across the river; he did not fire anywhere near where the people were, not the two shots I saw—I saw him draw something out of his pocket and put in, as if he was loading the revolver, and after that he said, "Stand back, or I will fire"; he said that both before and after loading it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Abelle Nava, a mineral water traveller, of 214, City Road—on Sunday, September 28, I went with my husband to Egham, with a party of friends—we went to the Victoria Hotel, and then walked up the river to the Sailing Club; we sat down for about two hours—Mrs. Crutchley's little girl, two years old, was with us—after sitting a couple of hours on the grass we got up and went back to tea—we did not all walk together; my husband and Reynolds were walking about twenty-five yards in front, then came myself and Mr. Crutchley, and Mrs. Bird and Mrs. Crutchley; the child was walking, and Mrs. Crutchley took it up because it was walking so slowly—we met a number of men and women on our way down to the boathouse; we were walking along, and met another party coming in the opposite direction; the two prisoners were among them—Mrs. Crutchley asked her husband to take up the child, and a woman said, "You are fools to have children, we have got none, "and Mrs. Crutchley said, "Well, you are a very lucky woman not to have any"—we were walking on, and a man came up to Crutchley and said he would toss him for a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>—that was Birch—Mrs. Crutchley said that her husband had not got a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi> to toss with—the man said, "If you have not got a <hi rend="italic">quid</hi>, take that," and punched his face, taking a piece of skin off his nose; he had the baby in his arms at the time—he set it down, and Mrs. Crutchley took it—I then saw three or four men punching Crutchley—I could recognise them if I saw them—the prisoners are two of them, and three or four other men came up and struck Crutchley also—I do not see any of them in Court—Bollatsch was one of them—I called to my husband, "<hi rend="italic">Bill, Bill</hi>, comeback, they are fighting"—he was twenty-five yards in front of us—he ran back and said, "Why don't you go about your business, and let us do the same; we do not want any row, we have come out to enjoy ourselves, not to quarrel?"—the three or four men then began punching me—they had been round Crutchley, but he got out from among them—when they heard me call my husband, they began punching me, and before he had finished speaking they began punching him also—I was punched in the side of my face, and that big man (<hi rend="italic">Birch</hi>) knocked my teeth, and knocked me into a ditch—they punched me while I was lying in the ditch, and that man, the furthest from me (<hi rend="italic">Bollatsch</hi>) hit me with a stick—some of the others struck me, but I cannot see them here—I tried to get up, and as I did so they knocked me back again—I screamed "Murder," several times, and called to my husband, "<hi rend="italic">Bill, Bill</hi>, if you don't help me they will kill me—they knocked Mrs. Crutchley down, and kicked her on her foot and punched her in the face—that fat man (<hi rend="italic">Birch</hi>) did that—I do not know which one kicked. her, but I saw the foot strike her—Birch knocked her down when he punched her in the face—Mrs. Crutchley expects</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> My husband and Reynolds were walking twenty-five yards ahead of us—I was walking with Mrs. Birch, Mr. and Mrs. Crutchley, and the child, all four abreast—I do not remember meeting those two men first (<hi rend="italic">Josling and Wright</hi>)—I saw Josling in the first lot—they might have passed me—I have seen Amelia Martin—I did not see her and another woman carrying a baby passing and looking at the river; I saw several men at the back of them; much nearer than eight or ten yards from them—both the prisoners were nearer than that to them, and others of the party were close by—it was when we were abreast of Amelia Martin and Mrs. George that the observation was made about the baby; I do not know which of them made it, but I am certain it was one of the two—my suggestion is that one of those women said, "You are b—fools to have children; "one of the women was carrying a baby, and so was Mrs. Bird—on one side there was a baby, and on the other side a baby and a little girl—they said, "You are b——fools to</p>

               <p>have children; we have none," and Mrs. Crutchley said, "You are very lucky not to have any"—I did not see anybody strike Amelia Martin on her back—I did not strike her; I never struck anybody; I never got the chance to—I did not spit in Amelia Martin's face, nor did I see anybody else do so; I must have seen it if it occurred—I was hit in the face, not by Amelia Martin, but she kicked me in the face—she was not hit in the back by me, nor did she turn round and hit me in the face; someone came up behind me and hit me in the back—that was immediately after the conversation about the baby—I never hit her at all—the only man with my party was Mr. Crutchley—I am certain I did not strike Amelia-Martin—I did not see Birch come up and take Amelia Martin by the arm and try to pull her away from me—while Martin and I were exchanging blows, Birch did not come up and take hold of Martin and pull her away and it was not in that way that all of us rolled into the ditch; our friends did not get the chance of gathering round; they were in the ditch-further up—my husband had no stick—I heard the first shot—up to that time I could see a little of what my husband was doing—he never used a stick; be never carried one—if he had had a stick I must have seen it—we went down by a break—when the police overtook us we were not walking to the railway station, we were walking along the road, and did not know where the railway station was; we were not going there—it was one of those men who was in the trap and gave my husband in custody, the further one (<hi rend="italic">Bollatsch</hi>)—I showed the inspector some of my bruises at the station—the hearing was several weeks after the summons. (<hi rend="italic">The summons was dated October</hi> 4)—at that time my husband had been several times before the Magistrate—he was, I believe, locked up and charged the next morning—Birch said, "God strike me blind, if I had known," and he did not go further—I do not know that he said if he had known there was a revolver in the party—he did not say anything about the water; he was talking for half an hour altogether—when the charge was taken against my husband, we were all together in the passage—I believe the remark was made in the presence of the inspector—he is not here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> When I was in the ditch I did not see the revolver in my husband's hand—he had no stick all day long—I cannot say what he carried a revolver for, he does not always do so; he only bought it three days before at a sale—he has a licence—there were a good many remands of the case on account of Josling's conduct—I made an application before a Justice for a summons as soon as I could—I did not go-before the Magistrate; Mr. Crutchley went, and three summonses were granted—I think the ditch was two feet deep where I was thrown in.</p>

               <p>Saturday, 18th October, about 11 p. m., I was in a street near the New Cut, walking with a female—I had five shillings in my right-hand pocket—three men came up and attacked me; one struck me in the face, another rifled my pocket, and the other threw me by putting his foot between mine; I fell and they left me; the prisoner was the last to go—I got up and followed him; I am sure he is the man, I saw his face—I called out "Police!" and "Murder!"—a policeman captured him; I had not lost sight of him—the woman was coming up behind me—I charged the prisoner with assaulting and robbing me—he said, "Are you sure it was me?"—I said, "Yes, if it was not you, what did you run away for?"—I was not quite sober, but I knew what I was about—I had money in my other pocket; that was not touched.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 2, Devonshire Terrace, Stratford—up to January last I was employed as manager to Mr. Bowman, jeweller, of Broadway, Deptford—during September and October, 1888, the prisoner bought some small articles of jewellery and a gold watch and chain for £14—in October, or the beginning of November, he came and gave me a visiting card with the name and address, "Frederick Vaughan Gibson, B. A., Houghton Green Manor, Playden,. Rye, Sussex," on the back was written, "1, Ruthin Road, Westcombe Park"—he said he was staying there while he was in town, that his father was lord of the manor at Playden, and owned about 800 acres—he showed me a three-stone diamond ring on his finger, and said it had been given to him, that he had shown it to his father, who thought he might as well have a better one while he was about it, and that he told his father he would ask me about it, and if it would be of any advantage to me I was to get him some to look at, as his father was going to give him a better one—I got from Mr. Bowman some diamond rings; I first gave two to the prisoner; he brought them back in a day or two, and said one was the kind he wanted but not quite good enough, and he asked me to get him some more similar, but more expensive—he showed me a letter purporting to come from his father—it was headed, "Houghton Green Manor," and signed "Gibson"—it spoke about the rings, and said if he sent the rings he would make a choice—I understood that the rings were to be sent to Houghton Green Manor—I gave him back the letter, and agreed to get him the rings for his father's approval—they were to go to Rye—I got three diamond rings of the value of £35, £38, and £50—the defendant had them a few days afterwards—I wrote to him asking which of the rings he would keep—a day or two after he came and brought back one</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189011240154"/>
               <p>of them, and I believe he told me his father had still got the other two and he thought he would buy one—a day or two afterwards he showed me a letter purporting to come from the prisoner's father—it spoke of the rings and about my going down to Rye to obtain a settlement for those that were kept—we arranged to go on the Friday or Saturday—before the day came the prisoner called and talked about some friends who were going to see an assortment of bracelets that were going to be sent down—before the day we were to go down the prisoner had two more single stone diamond rings of the value of about £45 and £50—I think he said his father was going to buy one for himself and one for a friend—previous to that the prisoner asked me to get him a diamond brooch and earrings to show to his mother—I agreed to do it, and towards the end of November I also let him have another ring worth £38 or £40—he said we could not go to Rye the day we had arranged, something was not ready, and it was arranged we should go down on the following Wednesday or Thursday—we did not go, but on the first day fixed for us to go I let the prisoner have three more rings of the value of £35 to £40—at the second day he had gone away—he had no rings after the first day we had arranged to go—he kept four or five altogether—I wrote to him at Fern Villas, pressing for a settlement, I think—he called and flew into a temper, and did not like me sending the letter—I got him a diamond spray brooch, worth £25, which he said he would show to his mother—he afterwards said he would have it if I had the earrings to match—he said he would not wait for the earrings, he would take the brooch as it was—that was nearly the last transaction—I got the bracelets and offered to take them to Rye—Mr. Bowman instructed me to take them to Rye myself—when I told that to the prisoner, he said it was no use, they were to be shown to friends some way off—he was very much annoyed, and said he would return all he had got—the value of the diamond bracelets was from £500 to £700—when he proposed writing and getting a cheque, I said, "I will call and get it"—it was arranged I should call the following evening for it, and the next evening I went to 7, Fern Villas and waited two or three hours out side the house—I could make no one hear—I saw nothing of the prisoner—I next saw him at Greenwich Police Court—one of the rings had parted with, I was afterwards shown by Mr. Fitt, a jeweller—I recognised it by the setting—except that ring I have not seen any article that I parted with—I believed at the time the statements that the prisoner made—I had no idea that he was dealing with Mr. Fitt—I have not been in the prosecutor's employment since January.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I kept some sort of books concerning these transactions—I should make these entries as on approval to the person they were for—I should take note of the messenger—if your servant came I should put your name, not his—I looked to your father through you for payment—I depended on you—the books were made up as transactions occurred—I gave no credit, or credit only for a very short time—if a person paid me within a week it would be entered in the sale book—Mr. Bowman used to call occasionally—I did not know when he was coming—he did not ask about these goods—on an average, perhaps, twenty customers came a day—I do not know where my memo randum is of the things I sent to you—I left it on the shelf when I left the shop—you bought a pair of gold sleeve links in July, 1888, and paid</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189011240155"/>
               <p>for them—you bought another set, which you did not pay for directly—I sent the bill to Houghton Green Manor—I don't think I pressed you for money—there were four or five bracelets—the. greatest value of any of them was £80 to £100—I sent you some gold chains, and a large quantity of pearls and diamonds—you returned the chains; you said the pearls were too expensive—I knew you from May to December—during that time you came frequently to the shop—I should think gold is easier to dispose of than diamonds, and pearls than diamonds—I gave you credit for the time for £200 or £300, not standing credit—I was very intimate with you during the time—I drove through Kent with you—I think I believed most of what you told me—I came to Fern Villa one day—you gave me no reason to think you would be gone when I found you gone—the house was in darkness, and no one answered the door—the reason you gave me for not going to Rye looked feasible—I called on your father—I said nothing to him about the fraud—I saw Mr. Scard once—you lent me books and papers, and we had a talk about literature when you called on business—I called on you independently of business.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The prisoner, in his defence, stated that he did not say that his father was lord of the manor, but a tenant of the lord of the manor, and that Mr. Osborn admitted that he looked to him, the prisoner, only, for the money; that he had obtained an appointment in Russia; but before leaving England he would have surrendered if he knew a warrant had been granted. He relied on the discrepancies in the evidence and the absence of the books, for an acquittal.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a general merchant, at 125, Fenchurch Sreet—I act as London agent for William Sidebottom amongst other firms since May, 1889—on 23rd September the defendant entered my service as a traveller and general clerk, and on the 1st October, 1889,1 discharged him—he said he would be revenged on me, and would ruin me as I had him—this letter is in his writing. (<hi rend="italic">This stated that he had been told by a friend that Lotinga had a few years ago misappropriated a large sum of money, ship dues, which had not been repaid twelve months ago; that he knew the firm in question would give help if proceedings were to be taken that Mrs. Lotinga, who had brought an action against the Commercial Union Insurance Company, was of the same family, and that the money was misappropriated before the trial, and was spent in law fees; that after the affair ended the family disappeared</hi>)—on 21st December I commenced an action against Mr. Sidebottom, in the course of which a discovery of documents was</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189011240159"/>
               <p>made by Sidebottom—this is the affidavit, dated 29th July, 1890, in which documents are disclosed—amongst them is a letter from the prisoner dated 13th December, 1889—in July last I was twenty-three years of age—the law proceedings referred to in the letter took place during 1883 and 1884—I was then sixteen—I had left school some months—I first saw this alleged libel during August last at Messrs. Rawcliffe's office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I first heard of this letter when it was disclosed in the affidavit of documents in the trial of an action—the defendant made discovery in process of law—I did not know of the existence of that letter till then—I was aware there were several such letters—Sidebottom had not threatened me with a prosecution prior to that action—he took his agency away—the defence he has given was that I had defrauded him—he had not accused me of fraud, and threatened to prosecute me before that—he made statements that had been made to him in several letters that I had done a number of things—in his letters to my solicitors I believe he made statements that I had defrauded him—my action against Sidebottom was for wrongful dismissal—I was his London agent on agreement—his defence was that I had been guilty of fraud in connection with a certain journey which he said had not been made, for which £25 was charged, and that I had charged for the postage of 800 letters which had never been posted—they were posted—I dismissed a Mr. Brown, a traveller, at the same time as I dismissed the prisoner—when I dismissed the prisoner he most certainly said something about ruining me—I do not know if Brown was there—I feel this libel very &amp; cutely—I tried to prose cute last December, but I could not. get the letters—I charged the prisoner with libel and conspiracy to ruin me about a month after his dismissal—we made an application to the Mansion House, but could get no documents—we could not get process granted—the case did not come on—I wrote to Mr. Sidebottom stating the facts exactly—I have not said the prisoner was a scoundrel that I recollect—I put before my principal the whole of the facts—I wrote, "On the accusation and invitation of a scoundrel such as Mealing"—I also wrote on the 11th November, 1889, "I was surprised by the strange conduct of your son in my office, who, in my absence, ransacked the drawers, collected all letters to me, and some of our circulars, and who appeared to be in correspondence behind my back with a clerk whom I had dismissed for defrauding and attempting to defraud you of twenty tons of cotton waste"—one of the. clerks I was charging with fraud was Mealing—I dismissed him for attempting to defraud Sidebottom of an order—he was only with me between three weeks and a month—I tried to prosecute him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I brought actions, I think, against other principals like Sidebottom, and succeeded in them—they were all based on exactly the same facts—this one is pending—Brown was my clerk—I had told Side-bottom before the 11th of November by letter that I accused the prisoner of defrauding me—I made the accusation against him as far back as 1889—he has never taken proceedings against me—he did not ask me for a character—I wrote to all his references telling them not to give him a character—no proceedings have been taken against me by him since I applied, on 6th December, 1889, at the Mansion House for proofs against him because of the reports I had heard that he had made against me in these different letters—it was those letters that brought about five actions against me—the Magistrate would not grant the summons.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The letter was received at Oldham—I have not got the envelope—it was de<lb/>stroyed—it was addressed from Wood Green—it was written by the prisoner to us in answer to a letter we wrote to him asking him to inquire into the character of Lotinga, to say if he had been guilty of any similar thing to the fraud we charged him with—I wanted to find out his previous character—at that time we had sufficient evidence for a criminal proceeding, and we wanted corroboration—Lotinga had accused Mealing of crime more than Mealing had Lotinga—the action by Lotinga against us is still pending—he commenced that when we charged him with fraud—we have pleaded fraud in the action—Mealing will be one of our London witnesses in that action—the letters have been in our solicitors' hands, and Mealing only saw them for the first time yesterday, when he asked for copies of them—I have known Mealing, perhaps, twelve months—he is respectably connected—I have no reason to believe he is guilty of fraud.</p>

                  </hi>. I was clerk to Messrs. Lotinga and Co., at 165, Fenchurch Street, from April, 1889, to 20th July, 1889—after that I was employed by Mr. Dixon, whose office adjoins Lotinga's—I remained there about seven months till February, 1890—I never knew the prisoner except by sight—I saw him go in and out of Lotinga's office—just before I left Mr. Dixon's at the beginning of this. year, I saw the prisoner in the hall of the building—he said, "Lotinga did mo harm, and I will do for him"—no one else was present—Brown was not there.</p>

               <p>hero," and threw me down as if I were a dog, and hurt me very much—I am in an advanced state of pregnancy—I screamed out—he took my purse while I was on the ground—he ran away—I told my husband, and he told the police—I was very bad and ill next day, and hare not been well since—I never saw the prisoner before to my knowledge—on the Tuesday after the robbery I saw him from my window going round the Circus, and recognised him—on the 12th I went to the station and saw eight or nine men, and identified the prisoner without hesitation; he is the man.</p>

I live at 22, Lismore Circus, and am a widow—on the evening of the 1st November I was coming out of my door, which is close to the corner of Alcroft Road—a little before nine I saw a woman thrown down by the prisoner—I could not say it was Mrs. Landry—I saw the prisoner stoop over the person and run away past me—I am quite sure it was the prisoner—there was a lamp just by there—on the 12th I went to the station and picked the prisoner out from amongst six or eight others after I had looked at him two or three times.</p>

Gardiner's did not close, he would not—I pointed out that there was no stipulation whatever when he signed—he mentioned about the heading, "Providing it was generally adopted in the trade"—I pointed out that was far too wide, as the tailoring trade extends over the kingdom; "Traders of shored "is the important part of it—he said he had made up his mind he would not close on Thursday, 16th—I sad that having signed he had certainly misled the other traders, because I have no doubt he, Casey, and myself are looked on as the largest traders in Shoreditch; our signatures were looked at before other people signed—on 16th, I believe, from what I heard that all the shops in Shoreditch closed—I closed at five o'clock—between 16th and 23rd I called on the prosecutor with Casey and Mr. Buck, a tailor in Shoreditch—we urged Abraham Lazarus to carry out his agreement, as we looked on it as being misleading—he would 'give no decided opinion, and did not seem to have made up his mind—I think he said he would write to Casey before the day closed—I reminded him of our previous conversation—on the 23rd Casey called on me and made a communication to me, and I went with him to the prosecutor's premises—both the Lazaruses were present—Casey said, "I have brought Mr. Phillips to prove what I said was the truth, although you called me a liar"—I think both Lazaruses said to Casey, M We told you not to come into our premises again; we won't have you here, get out"—a rush was made by the brothers, and they pushed Casey out; one laid hands on his collar—I was inside; I expressed indignation that I was brought there to witness such behaviour, and I said to Lazarus I was very much surprised at their behaviour, if I had known what was going to happen I would not have come there—Casey was naturally annoyed, and became very excited, and came back and offered to fight them, and I suggested to the brothers that they should go outside and fight him—when Casey and I first went in the brothers were very excited from Casey coming into their place at all—during the whole time I was in the shop I did not hear Casey say anything about forcing them to close—I have no particular leaning towards either the prosecutor or Casey; I am on friendly terms with both of them.</p>

Gardiner's, in Whitechapel, was included in it; it was confined to Shoreditch—the inclusion of Bethnal Green, Hackney, and Hoxton is owing to the activity of Casey, who obtained those outlying districts; but the petition only referred to Shoreditch; it is one branch—to this petition there were many signatures outside Shoreditch itself.</p>

Lazarus; they have called me a liar"—I think I first spoke to Mr. Casey a very short time before the petition—I am impartial between the two parties—I hope my word is absolutely to be relied on—the assault on Casey was certainty not gentle—the majority of the tradespeople there adopted the early closing movement, and even last Saturday bills were up in some of the windows asking people not to shop after five o'clock; Mr. Peters has one very prominently—Whitechapel is a totally distinct district from Shoreditch.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an assistant to Mr. Birch, of 147, High Street, Whitechapel—I am in no way connected with Casey—I took a strong interest in the early closing movement, and in July I filled in this jet it ion—I went to the prosecutors with it—I saw Mr. Emmanuel Lazarus, and said, "I am getting up an early closing movement for shoreditch,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189011240178"/>
               <p>and your name would be of great service; will you sign the petition?"—he signed it—he said, "I will sign this petition with pleasure, but you will never get Mr. Casey to sign it"—I said nothing to him about general adoption or anything of that sort; I was getting up the petition to close in Shoreditch—neither he nor I said anything about conditions, except that he said, "You will never get Mr. Casey's"—I saw Casey some days afterwards; he signed it after Lazarus—I was a party to the meeting of shop assistants at' the Ship and Blue Ball on 27th October—to a certain extent that was to take steps to ask Lazarus to close—a deputation was pro posed to wait on Lazarus—Casey was not at that meeting, and had nothing to do with getting it up—at the close of the meeting just over £2 was collected from those present—Casey did not subsequently subscribe to that—no arrangements were made to try and coerce Lazarus; we only wanted a demonstration to show the public—I know who hired the band that played in front of Lazarus's premises on 30th October; it was not Casey—he did not contribute a penny to pay for the band—I acted as treasurer, and collected subscriptions at this meeting—not quite all the subscriptions were expended on the meeting of the 30th; but the greater portion was—the band was paid for out of that money—Casey did not pay one penny to that fund—there was an organised demonstration on 30th October, by arrangement beforehand—no programme had been issued beforehand to the band—I know the persons who organised the demonstration, and I could mention their names, they were shop assistants—I did not say I organised it myself; Casey had nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was in this crowd on the 30th part of the time—I was not with the band when it went by Lazarus's premises the first time; later on I was there—I took no part in the rioting—I did not hoot nor groan; I heard a lot of cheering—cheering predominated, and if there was hooting I did not hear it, because the cheering drowned it—I was there from four or five up to past nine—I saw the band coming backwards and forwards the first part of the evening, and stop opposite the shop once when an omnibus came in front of it—the band went slowly in front of Lazarus's shop; it went past about six times—I saw Hurnell on the front of the van—I did not see him wave his hat or lead cheers and groans—he was in front of the driver, and threw bills to the people—Day is no relation of mine—from seven to nine I saw a crowd in front of Lazarus's shop, and on the other side of the way; it was not sufficient to block the roadway—I did not know it was necessary for the police to clear the people away from the front of the shop to allow people to pass—I did not see the police make exertions—I saw Day and Casey there—I did not see Day speak to Casey—I was not there when Lazarus came out—I went home about twenty minutes to ten—I left the street at two or three minutes to nine—I did not leave because I thought the crowd was getting too unruly; I refuse to say why I left the street; I am afraid to incriminate myself—this petition only refers to Shoreditch—I wrote to Lazarus on 9th October, "We are now canvassing Whitechapel, where we have already had some success, and in time, with the good example of Shore ditch, we shall have the greater part of Mile End," because I heard that Lazarus objected to a firm in Whitechapel—the petition did not refer</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="189011240179"/>
               <p>to all those places—the meeting was on the 27th, not on the 29th—it was a meeting to discuss the matter in a peaceable way, and to arrange for a deputation, but the demonstration was the outcome of it—there was only one meeting to my knowledge—there was no arrangement for a band to parade in front of Lazarus's shop—the band was arranged after the meeting; funds were provided at the meeting, and we wanted a band to demonstrate to the public, and we collected money, and that was the way it was spent—we had no arranged committee, we trusted in each other as assistants—Casey was not at the meeting on the 27th—I moved a resolution—I did not say that the leadership devolved on Henry Casey, I only alluded to him as regards getting signatures—Mr. Stacey talked about my getting signatures, and Mr. Lazarus's among others, and I said, "No, that honour does not rest on me, as Mr. Casey's name deserves to be a household word, as getting signatures"—I said nothing about "leader"—Mr. Sharkey, one of Mr. Casey's assistants, was at the meeting—he-said he was satisfied with the conditions under which he worked; he was not hooted at and howled down—Nathan, I believe, is in Casey's employ ment—he did not convey the money to the band—I did not hear who did it.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">This asked Casey to intercede with Mr. Lynes, and said that he and Pears were the only ones left U sign, and thanked him for his assistance</hi>)—Lynes was a large tailor in Shoreditch—I never said a word to Casey about having a band to play up and down in front of Lazarus's premises—on Saturday nights we leave off work at twelve, or sometimes afterwards—now we have a holiday on Thursdays in consequence of this movement—the district secretary "at the head of the petition refers to the secretary sent to work in the district, in which I am.</p>

Shoreditch is patrolled by the G and H Divisions, and Lazarus's premises are almost on the boundary line—we are on the same side as Casey's shop—on the night of the 3th a number of my division, uniform and detective officers, were on duty by Lazarus's place—I had charge of the men from six to eight—I saw Casey for a few minutes—I knew him years before I joined the police; I might say he is one of the principal and most respectable tradespeople of shoreditch—I did not see him any way misconduct himself or take part in the demonstration; I should not have thought he was connected with it, but for knowing he was a tailor, and seeing his premises closed—I saw him about twelve yards from his own premises, and about sixty from the prosecutor's, which were on the other side of the road—I have a beat of sixty yards backwards and forwards on the right-hand side, and I saw Casey the greater part of the evening—I saw him take no part whatever in the demonstration; he seemed quite indifferent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I was only there between six and eight—both of Casey's shops were shut up—I went in consequence of bills stuck in proximity to his place—it was my usual time for going there; I had six extra constables—the G Division were there before I got there; I know nothing of them—Farquhar would be one side of the way and I the other—there were two plain clothes constables on our side of the road—one</p>

               <p>of Hopkins and Pegg's assistants asked me to keep their doorway clear if I could—it was necessary to keep the roadway clear on both sides there may have been 1,000 persons when the band went by—there was only a little hissing—if Farquhar says it was an angry crowd I should contradict him—it was a good-tempered crowd, laughing and passing jokes all the time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> I went there in the ordinary course of my duty at six—I did not see or hear of a single stone thrown or blow struck, I took no one in custody—there was no complaint of anything or of any person being taken in custody—Bishopsgate is rather broad about there—there was very little more difficulty for people to pass up and down than there usually is—Hopkins and Pegg's is an attractive shop, women and peram bulators generally <hi rend="italic">monopolise the path there</hi>—r saw <hi rend="italic">bills like these</hi> being given about—the crowd was good-humoured and chaffing rather than anything else—I was relieved by Sergeant Moffat.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I relieved the other sergeant, who had other duties to attend to, in consequence of a communication at headquarters—I was opposite the prisoner's shop—Farquhar is an experienced officer—I did not see Day there—I saw Hurnell on the van, on several occasions, waving his hat, hooting followed—Casey was there the whole time I was there—Farquhar was more in the crowd than I was, and had better opportunities of seeing the demeanour of the crowd, I could not speak of what took place on the other side—I saw a rush take place when Lazarus came out—I did not see Hurnell in the crowd that made the rush; it appeared to be rather an angry but not a dangerous rush—the police surrounded some one, and escorted him to the station—I went there myself—the crowd followed, hooting and groaning—I heard no cries.</p>

I am a hosier at 4, Church Street—I am in no way connected with Casey—on 30th October, about eight, I was in Shoreditch—I saw Casey on several occasions standing outside his shop at the corner of Church Street—I said a word to him and passed on—I was there till the end of this alleged riot—I did not see Casey take any part in it.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant secretary of the Early Closing Association, at 100, Fleet Street—I was subpœnaed for the prosecution at the Police-court and here—I have declined to give them a statement—on 23rd October, I and Casey waited on Messrs. Lazarus in regard to closing at five o'clock on Thursday—I did not hear him tell Messrs. Lazarus that he would force them to close; all I remember that Casey said was, "Public opinion will be against you if you don't close"—there was no threat to coerce and make them close—Casey was very anxious, indeed, that Messrs Lazarus should give way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I am impartial—I did not tell Lazarus that if anyone was to blame it was Messrs. Gardiner; when they said their reason for not closing was that Gardiner did not, I said I thought it was a reason able objection, not a necessary one—at the interview on 23rd Casey and I were somewhat excited—nearly the whole of the conversation is gone from my memory; I did not attach much importance to it—if two wit nesses say that Casey said, "We will force you to close" I cannot contradict it; I should not be prepared to swear with or against them—Casey sat on a table and said, "If you wish me to go you had better turn me out,' but afterwards he left—he did not call Lazarus a liar—Lazarus said something about getting a policeman; I asked Casey to go out with me; I thought it would be in the interest of the movement if we left; I felt sure Mr. Lazarus would not join the movement if it went on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Re-examined.</hi> Casey made no threat about forcing him to close—these petitions are always regarded by the trade as applying to particular districts; the question about their applying to districts outside has never been raised before—I never heard of any argument about this matter till Lazarus came into it; and these. circulars have been in use now seven years, to the best of my knowledge.</p>

I live at 14, Little Essex Street, Kingsland Road—on 27th November, about 4.30 or 5 p.m. I was in New North Road; it was a bit foggy—I fancy the prisoners ran out of a lodging-house after me; I did not see them—one of them took my arms behind me, and Cotton broke my locket off my chain; I saw him, he was in front of me; I knew him by sight—I followed them; they went behind St. John's Road School; there they kicked and knocked me about, and bruised me all over up against the railings of the school, and Fox kept saying to Cotton, "Give it to him back," and he Would not; he said, "No, I shan't give it to him back, let us keep it"—I ran after them again and lost sight of them—I told a policeman in Hoxton, and then I went to the station—I next saw the prisoners among eight or nine boys at the station, and I picked them out directly I went in—this is the locket—I might have made a mistake at the Police-court about the time; it was a little after ten when I got to the station to identify them.</p>

I am a stoker, and the last witness's husband—she keeps a shop in Bastwick Street—on this morning I was awakened out of sleep by a noise in the room, and I saw a scaffold-pole, 16ft. or 18ft. long, at the foot of my bed, one end on the floor, and the other end through the skylight—I saw a man standing behind the scaffold pole, near an easy-chair—he said, "All right, Charlie, I have made a mistake; I am going to No. 19"—then I said, "You had better get out as soon as you can"—while I was speaking, a man above put his arm through the skylight with something in his hand, I thought it was a revolver, I won't be sure—he said, "If you touch him I will shoot your b——brains out, and your missus's too"—I said, "You had better get out as quick as ever you can"—he climbed up the pole, and when he got up on the roof, I pulled the pole down and put it across the room—a few minutes after a man came and put his arm through the skylight, and said, "You had better give us a few shillings, or I will blow you b——brains out"—I said, "I am only a poor man. I cannot afford it, I have got to work for my living"—he said, "Oh, all right," and was off—the pole was one of two that had been in the next yard for about eighteen months—I communicated with the police—next day I went to the police-station and picked out the prisoner from about ten or twelve others as the man I had seen in the room—I have not the slightest doubt about him; I had a decent lamp hanging from the ceiling, and there was a good light—Mr. Gover and three or four families, I</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">G</hi> 350). About 12.45 a.m. on 5th November I was on duty in Whitecross Street, St. Luke's, and saw a crowd round two men quarrelling there—the prisoner was there—one of the two men was drunk—one went away, the other, Keefe, refused to do so, and I took him into custody—Sergeant Guthrie was with me—I brought Keefe a short distance; Guthrie was on the other side of him; he was struggling—the prisoner pulled some sharp instrument from his pocket and deliberately struck me on the nose with it, saying, "God blind me! don't take a liberty; if you do I will"—he had said nothing previously—I let Keefe go, and followed the prisoner into Bed Lion Market, where I lost sight of him—Guthrie came up after me—about two and a half hours after I saw him brought into the station in custody, and I identified him—my wound was dressed immediately by Dr. Cliffe—I was in uniform—the wound was a bad one; it cut right into the cavity of my nose; it was very painful, and I feel the effects now in cold weather—I am positive the prisoner was the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> The prisoner was standing outside a public-house about ten yards from where the men were quarrelling—I don't know if he works at the public-house—he was taking no part in the quarrel—we had as much as we could do to take Keefe—we had gone about half a mile with him—a crowd was about us—the first that attracted my attention was a stab on my nose; it bled profusely—I could not say with what I was stabbed—the man who stabbed me got away in the crowd—the prisoner was afterwards brought into the station as the man who had stabbed me, and I charged him—he was not very drunk—the man who stabbed me was very drunk—I had seen the prisoner before several times—I knew him by sight.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Sergeant O</hi> 19). I was with the last witness at 12.45—two people were quarrelling—I was assisting him to take Keefe to the station when the prisoner jumped from the crowd in front of us and said, "Don't take a liberty, constable," and then he raised an instrument, and I think he said a second time, "Don't take a liberty, or God blind me! I will"—he pulled an instrument out from his side; I could not tell what it was, it glistened very clearly—he dealt the constable a blow in the face, like a thrust, and ran away—I told the constable to go to the station; we followed the prisoner some distance—we let the other man go—the prisoner ran up a court out of Whitecross Street into Bed Lion Market—I cannot say which of five houses he went into; I went into two before I came to the prisoner's house, No. 11, where I found him in bed with his trousers on—I said, "Harry, I want you"—he replied, "Oh, my wife and children, governor, I did not do it "I had not charged him with doing anything—I said I should take him to the station for stabbing the last witness—when charged at the station he said, "I don't mind doing it"—he was in the first stage of drunkenness; he seemed capable of getting about, he could run and walk very well, but he had been drinking—I knew him very well—I have not the least doubt he is the man.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I said before the Magistrate that in my opinion the prisoner was drunk—my deposition was read to me, and I signed it as correct—before it was put in the deposition I wanted to explain that the man appeared to me to have been drinking—it is a very rough neigh<lb/>bourhood</p>

               <p>—all this was done in a very few minutes; there was a crowd—I do not think it took a minute the way he did it—he ran up the court—I <hi rend="italic">did</hi> not hear Gallagher say he ran back into the crowd—he passed the crowd and run up the court—I saw his back when he ran away—a narrow passage leads into Red Lion Market from the court—I last saw the min turn into the court—I did not see him in the market—there are two other entrances to the Red Lion Market, I believe—no one was visible when I got into Red Lion Market.</p>

                  </hi>, M. R. C. S. I live at 20, King's Square, St. Luke's, and am acting for the divisional surgeon of police there—on this night I was at the Old Street police-station and saw the prosecutor, who was suffering from an incised wound on his nose, about one and a half inches long and half an inch deep—it severed through the cartilage of the nose into the nasal cavity—I dressed the wound—he bled very much—before I left the station the bleeding recommenced—I applied compresses and bandages—I had previously stitched the wound—the division was so complete that the nose fell on the upper lip—in my opinion the wound was caused by a thrust or stab from some sharp cutting instrument—the blow was on the right side, and slightly from above downwards—a table knife, if it cut on both edges, would have caused the wound; it was a punctured wound, cutting right through on both sides—a sharp trowel or carpenter's chisel, or anything of that kind could have caused it, a ring on a finger could not—he will always bear the mark, a bad scar—it was a very severe wound—the trowels I saw could not have caused it; they had mortar on them.</p>

About 9.30 on Sunday night, 26th October, I went with Lee to the Exmouth Arms beer-house, and upstairs: a "sing-son?" was going on, and fifty or sixty people were assembled—Lee identified Adams as the man that knocked him down and robbed him the same morning—the prisoner was chairman—I said, "I am a police officer, and shall arrest you for assaulting this man, and robbing him of 7s. at a coffee-stall on Mount Pleasant, about 12.30 on the 26th"—he said, "I never saw this man before"—I took him in custody—on the way to the station he said, "I will tell you the truth. I know the prosecutor, and when I was having a cup of coffee at a stall in Farringdon Road he pushed against me. I asked him what he done that for; he then struck me in the eye, and we had a fight.
