                  </hi>. I am a soda-water manufacturer, and carry on business in Holland-street, Brixton-road. In March last year I took the pri<lb/>soner into my service as bottler, and he continued so up to Saturday, 30th June—I discharged him that day, in consequence of his making use of very insulting language towards me—his wages were 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—he lived in a house on the premises, for which he was to pay me 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—he came to my house on the Monday morning for the keys of the factory—I did not let him have them—I told him he was discharged, and he said, "Then, by God! I will ruin you"—I never had, while the prisoner was with me, a man of the name of John Redding, or any person who went by that name—I do not recollect ever hearing of such a person—the prisoner must have known that I had no such person—I think I can answer that I never had a man whose real name I did not know—on 10th July last I was arrested in Brixton-road in the public street, near where I live, and Mr. Biden of Cheapside, and another gentle<lb/>man, became bail for me immediately—I never had the slightest intention either to quit this country or avoid my creditors—I know Mr. Rawlings, of Lothbury—I never sent him any boxes for the purpose of their being shipped on board an Australian vessel—I never sent a man named Redding, or any other person, to carry any boxes to Mr. Rawlings for that purpose—I have not sold my business or property, or had the slightest idea of it, or of discon<lb/>tinuing it.</p>

               <p>to Shipton, and he walked across the road to the prisoner—the prisoner then drew a pistol from his side-pocket, and presented it at the policeman, saying "Advance another step and I will fire"—the policeman advanced, and I dis<lb/>tinctly saw the flash in the pan—I did not hear the click—there was then a struggle between Shipton and the prisoner—they both fell, and the prisoner was secured—Hammond took the pistol from the prisoner—they then both got up, and the prisoner said, "I have lost my defence; I will go quietly"—as they were walking, the prisoner turned round towards him and said "I will have my revenge"—he was then taken to the station.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Lovell. On the afternoon of 4th Sept. I was in Basinghall-street—I saw Shipton advance towards the prisoner to take him into custody—he put his hand into his right-hand pocket, took a pistol out, presented it, and said, "Stand off, for your life! another step and I will fire"—he pulled the trigger; it missed fire, and flashed in the pan—I saw the flash—he was taken into custody, and I saw the pistol taken from him by Hammond.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gun-maker, of London Wall. On 4th Sept. Shipton brought this pistol to me—I unscrewed it, drew the charge, and it contained powder and a bullet—I gave it to Shipton, folded up in this paper—this bullet-mould would make bullets to fit this pistol—I do not think the pistol had been fired, although it had been pulled—I do not think there appeared to be any soot on the pan—I think it was clean as it is now—I do not think it had been primed, or if it was, it was with such poor powder that it would not act as the best powder would—if it had fired it would have blacked the pan—I do not think it could have flashed in the pan—I did not hold the pistol in my hand while I unscrewed the barrel; I put it in a vice, so that I took no soot off the pan—when I saw it first of all, I think it was clean.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of Mr. Charles Baker and another—it was my duty to take down meat in a cart to Christ's Hospital, at Hertford, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I have known the prisoner two or three years—about two months after I began to go to Hertford, I saw the prisoner outside his house—he keeps a beer-shop at Enfield Highway—it was about the middle of March—he called me, and asked if I would go in and have anything to drink—I did, and we had a pint of ale together—he asked me if I could bring down a joint of meat or two worth the money—I said I could, and took him down a leg of mutton the following day—he asked if I would stop there and take breakfast—he said I might as well stop there as anywhere, else, and he would get breakfast for me at half-past six in a morning—I stopped, and breakfasted there from that time, and I continued to take meat there every other morning; I did not miss once in any journey—I was paid for the meat about once a week, on an average of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I remember leaving him a clod of beef in April; he paid me 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound for that—the fair wholesale price was about 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—no bill was made of the different joints—when there was a settlement between us, we got a piece of chalk and chalked it on a board—he did not pay me in full; he always knocked off the odd halfpence—he told me he ought to have half the profit as well as myself—I put the meat in the cellar when I took it down, because it was a more sly place—he told me to take it down there, and nobody would have any suspicion—he said that several times—I had offered him a piece of meat once in the tap-room, and he told me not to offer it there, he would make it all right, and I took the meat into the cellar—I sold meat to other persons down the road—the meat which I delivered at the prisoner's was my master's; it was not paid for by me—it was given me by Wildgoose—I cannot say that I have not stolen some myself—I told the prisoner that</p>

I am a nurse in the service of Mr. Buller, of Par-sonage-road, Enfield, and was so in June and July last—I know the prisoner, and knew the deceased John Cock, he was Mr. Buller's footman—I saw the prisoner at Mr. Buller's, on Sunday, 1st July—about three in the afternoon I was up-stairs preparing for Church—the deceased came up and asked me to come down and see his baby—I said I would come down when I was ready for Church—I went down in about five minutes, and went into the kitchen-there was no one there—I then passed through the kitchen to the pantry door—the pantry adjoins the kitchen—I there saw the deceased lying on his back, with his feet in the kitchen and his body in the pantry—the prisoner was standing by his right side, close to him, more towards his head than his feet, and she had the child on her left hip with her arm round it—through the door where the deceased lay on the left, there was a dresser, and immediately on his right there was a sink—the prisoner was between him and the sink, with her back to the sink and her face towards him—I heard no cry or excla<lb/>mation before I went down—nothing had attracted my attention—I had tocóme some distance from my room, along a passage and down a flight of stairs—any one in the pantry might have called out without my hearing it in my room—the deceased appeared dead when I first went to him—as I approached the pantry door the prisoner asked me to go and fetch a doctor—I immediately ran to the bottom of the stairs and called the cook, who was up-stairs dressing for Church—I directly returned to the pantry and said, "Perhaps he is only faint, there is no occasion to fetch a doctor"—she said, "For God's sake fetch a doctor; see what I have done," pointing to the body at the same time—» then looked at the man and saw blood on the top of the left waistcoat-pocket—I had not seen that before—I did not touch him—he had no coat on—then went to a neighbour and requested him to go for a surgeon immediately—I did not see the cook come down—I had then gone out for the doctor—had</p>

I was cook in the service of Mr. Buller, and had been so six weeks when this matter occurred—during that time, previous to the Sun<lb/>day, I had seen the prisoner there once—on Sunday, 1st July, I was dining in the kitchen with the deceased and the coachman, about one o'clock, and the prisoner came in, bringing her child—she appeared to be in a very heated state by walking—I spoke first, and said, '. Oh, dear, what a heat you are in!" and I took the baby from her—I asked her to sit down and have a bit of dinner—she did so—her husband walked round the table, and said, "What brought you here?"—she said, "You know what I have come for"—those were the first words she spoke in the kitchen—the dinner was not over when she came in; they had just helped once round—when the prisoner said, "You know what I have come for," the deceased and she appeared a little excited with each other, and I do not know what the reply was—he seemed vexed at her coming, and she seemed a little out of temper with him—that was before she sat down to dinner—she had not sat down before the deceased asked her what she came there for, that was when she first came into the kitchen; she answered, and then it was I asked her to sit down to dinner—she thanked me, and sat down—they appeared angry with each other—he appeared angry with her coming, and she made an angry answer—I cannot exactly say whether her husband gave her a chair or not—the deceased sat down again at the table, and nursed the child while the prisoner had her dinner—he took the child from me—the deceased did not eat any more dinner after she came—the angry feeling subsided in a few minutes, I did not see it after a minute or two; I saw them conversing together, apparently without anger—the deceased was in and out of the kitchen to the parlour after dinner, till I left it, about three o'clock, and went up-stairs—the dinner was at one, and the prisoner came in about one, or a minute or two after—I went up-stairs at three o'clock, to dress for Church, and left no one but the deceased, the prisoner, and the little child, in the kitchen—the door between the kitchen and pantry was then open, as it gene<lb/>rally was—my room is on the second-floor—while I was dressing the nurse called me at the bottom of the stairs—I heard her call—I had not heard any noise, or call, or shriek, or anything of that sort before; she called, "Cook, cook, come down directly, John is very ill!"—I went down immediately, went through the kitchen, and found John lying between the two rooms, across the doorway which separates the two—the prisoner was in the kitchen, crying—I saw her before I went to the doorway—I believe she said, "Fetch someone," or something of that kind—as I went through the kitchen, the steel on which we sharpen the knives was lying by the side of deceased's legs—it was usually kept in the pantry—I never recollect seeing it in the</p>

               <p>kitchen before—the knife-tray was on the dresser, on the right-hand side, in the pantry, as you go in, facing the sink—there were white-handled knives in it—I had never seen the steel before that day, but I always under<lb/>stood it was kept in the pantry—I had never seen it in the kitchen—I did not notice any blood about the deceased—I went back into the kitchen, where the prisoner still was, got some vinegar, and washed the deceased's face with it—I believe I asked for it when I went into the kitchen—it was usually kept in the kitchen cupboard, and 1 went there and got out the cruet—the prisoner saw me do that—I do not recollect that she said anything when I washed his face with the vinegar—after I had bathed his face, I called, "John, John!" and tried to see whether he would speak—at last he said, "Humph"—I called him again repeatedly, and said, "John, here is your wife"—he said, faintly, 'What does she want?" and that was all he said—after I bad washed his face I saw blood on his left breast, and asked the prisoner what it meant by the blood issuing from the heart, and if ever she had heard him complain of an affection of the heart—she said "No, never"—that was after he had said, "What does she want?"—Mr. Asbury soon after came, and the deceased was found to be dead—before he came I had run down the drive to see if I could get anybody to come in, and I met Charlotte Grant, the nurse, there—I could not find anybody, and ran back as quick as I could—I could not have been gone above a couple of minutes—when I returned the prisoner was in the pantry, kneeling down, and looking at her husband—I do not recollect that she said anything to him—I think she was loosening his neckcloth, but I will not be sure—I then, for the first time, discovered that he was stabbed, just as Mr. Asbury came in—the prisoner was collected at that time—I said, "Good God, he is stabbed!"—I do not know that I said that pointedly to any one—the prisoner, Grant, and her mother, who had come in, were there—the prisoner was close by, standing on one side of the body, and I on the other—she did not make any observation.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, of Enfield. I was called in on 1st July, to Mr. Buller's house—I got there after four o'clock—I saw the deceased lying on his back, between the kitchen and the pantry—I found a wound on the leftside, made by some cutting instrument—I afterwards made a post. mortem examination, by order of the Coroner—the wound was about an inch in length, and immediately above the sixth rib—the knife produced would make that description of wound—I passed another knife, of the same size, in the direction of the wound, and it corresponded precisely—the wound took a direction from left to right; first entering the left cavity of the chest, passing over the lower margin of the left lobe of the lung, and entering the pericardium, it transfixed the heart—the knife went through the right ventricle of the heart—I attribute the death to loss of blood from that wound—there cannot be the least doubt that that wound caused the death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you formed any judgment as to whether it was a wound that could have been inflicted by the deceased himself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It could not have been done by his right hand—I have not the least doubt about that—it is pos<lb/>sible that it may have been done with his left hand—if it was done with his left hand, he must have placed his left arm in an unnatural position for striking a blow; that is to say, the elbow must have been drawn backwards, in this position (<hi rend="italic">placing his arm close to his side</hi>), and the knife would go to the anterior part of the chest, anterior to the lungs—that must have been the case either with a back-handed blow or a front blow; in either case the arm must have been held back, to bring the point of the knife to where it entered, to inflict that wound—he was not a very thin man, but not corpulent; not so lusty as myself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At what part of the heart was the wound? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the apex of the right ventricle; a contraction of that ventricle would propel the blood in an opposite direction to that of the wound, and therefore he would live a much longer time than if the other portion of the heart had been reached—he might probably have lived twenty minutes—that is the side of the heart which propels the blood through the lungs, not that which supplies the brain, so that' his intellect would continue much longer than if the left ventricle had been wounded—he would not drop the instant the wound was inflicted—he would be capable of walking for some paces—he might be capable of speaking after he recovered from the fainting—when syncope takes place a coagulum of blood would fill up the orifice in the heart—I should say a man would probably be able to speak about fifteen minutes after receiving such a wound—I am not aware of cases where persons have walked half-a-mile after the heart has been wounded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BODKIN</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this a wound of the heart that would cause the blood to drip slowly, or the reverse? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In a contraction of the ventricle there would be no loss of blood from the heart in the intervals—the loss of blood would take place as the ventricle was being filled from the office—during that time the blood would come in quantities—it would perhaps be five or six seconds after receiving such a wound before he would become faint and unable to stand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you believe that after the infliction of this wound, by whomsoever inflicted, this person could have walked, called another person to him, and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170047"/>
               <p>laid down on the floor, and afterwards speak so as to express his belief that be should soon be better? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He might be capable of walking three or four paces; he would then feel faint, and probably attempt to support himself by the dresser, or any furniture that would be near him; he would then lower himself gradually to the ground; he would be conscious of a faintness coming on; and under those circumstances it is I account for his being on his back—if he had fallen suddenly he would have gone head first, and fallen on his face—I should not think the violence of the blow would have anything to do with it—it must have been inflicted with considerable force—when he recovered from the first syncope, which he would do by lying on his back on the floor, the horizontal position being the most favourable for him, he would be capable of speaking—the intellect would recover—it might be from five to ten minutes after receiving the blow that he would be capable of speaking—I did not observe a knife-tray on the dresser—I saw the dresser and the sink—if he had stabbed himself, I think that he could not probably have placed the knife in the sink—I do not think the knife would have been transferred from the left band to the right, and placed in the sink—I have seen cases of suicide by stabbing in the side, and I have read of other cases—I have not myself known a case of suicide by stabbing with the left hand—supposing the deceased to have com<lb/>mitted this act himself, the direction of the wound was not such as would have followed a stab by himself with his left hand—I think if he had inflicted it with his left hand the arm would have been placed in a position which would give it the greatest purchase, and therefore the arm would have been extended, and he would drive the knife into his body—in that case the direction of the wound would be different; it would go from the surface to the centre; this traversed from left to right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Will you tell me what part of the heart's circle cannot be reached with the right hand? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It would be an extremely difficult mat<lb/>ter for me to take that knife and to drive it into my chest in the direction this was—it might depend a good deal on the sort of chest and the length of the arm—it must be a longer arm than mine—you could not drive it in anteriorly with your right hand, because it is an unnatural position—it would depend a good deal on the position of the person—I have read a good many books on this subject—I know "Beck's Medical Jurisprudence," it is a very old work—there are extraordinary wounds committed by suicides, but they are generally on the right side—I do not know that they are in all positions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I believe in the centre of the chest there is a bone, called the sternum? Yes, to which are articulated the cartilages that fasten the ribs to the sternum—the wound passed behind the sternum—it passed immediately above the sixth rib, where the rib terminates in cartilage, and proceeded over the left lobe of the lung, horizontally, but inclining a little inwards—I do not think a person could inflict that wound upon himself, not to carry the point of the knife in the direction in which it went for three inches and a half—if he did he must draw the knife along—it could not be a stab—if he had done it himself it would have gone more directly inwards—it was a mere matter of chance that the heart was transfixed at all, because when the ventricle con<lb/>tracts there is a recoil, and at that instant the hrart strikes against the ribs, and at that moment the point of the knife must have come in contact with the ventricle, otherwise it could not have been wounded at all—the wound was three inches deep—I do not think the man could have inflicted such a wound in that direction; besides, the knife was not very sharp—the proximate cause of death was the loss of blood, not the blood filling up the cavity and pre<lb/>venting the action of the lungs—there was no blood in the right cavity of the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170048"/>
               <p>heart, consequently the right lobe of the lung was not impeded in its action—the brain is supplied from the left side of the heart—that supply of blood to the brain would continue, and so long as that continued, consciousness, power of speech, and ability to stand would remain, and for a much longer period than if the left ventricle had been wounded, because that would stop the supply to the brain—so long as the brain was supplied with blood, there would be no impediment to the intellect—faintness results from want of blood to the head—there would be a series of faintings and recoveries till death took place—in my judgment the wound could not have been inflicted with the man's right hand.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 272, Strand. In 1845 I had apartments in the same house with the prisoner—her husband lived with her at that time—they were there during the whole summer and autumn of that year—I had little opportunity of observing how they lived together, but I noticed that they were frequently in the habit of quarrelling—I and others in the house have gone up on occasions, in consequence of those quarrels—I did not know what the quarrels were about—I could never make out—in fact, not being my own concern I did not trouble myself much about it, only we were in a state of alarm and went up in consequence—I do not remember "murder!" being called—on one occasion we went up to the room—we did not go in, or try to open the door—I did not on any occasion see either of the parties—the lodgers went up to quell the noise.</p>

In the early part of the present year I lived in Napier-street, Hoxton, in the same house with the prisoner—I was rather on intimate terms with her—she has several times made representations to me about her husband during the present year, and before that—I know her to be an extremely jealous woman—her conversation was always upon jealousy of her husband—I cannot exactly call to mind what she has said—she has generally said that he was not constant to her—about four or five weeks before her husband's death, we were sitting at tea, and her conversation ran on jealousy, and she said I should hear of something before long, for the night before she had inquired the price of two pistols—I said, "I don't mind what jealous people say, they say anything; if I thought you were in earnest, I would get</p>

               <p>my husband to write to him and put him on his guard—she said, "How can be help himself, if I am determined to do it?"—I said, "By not allowing you to go there, or coming here himself"—she then laughed and said, "Do you think I am going to be such a fool?"—I said, "I hope not, for the sake of this dear child," I had the child on my lap at the time—I do not remember anything more that was said that day, but on various occasions I have heard her declare that she would do for him, as she knew he was acquainted with other women—I have heard her at various times complain of the housemaid, and sometimes it was the cook, the nursemaid, and the governess—she said she knew they used to come to town with him, and he used to spend some time with them before he came to her.</p>

You say that I never send to you without a complaint—pray what would you have me say? You ask me to let you know how I am, and because I tell you I am not well, you say I always make a complaint. But you need not ask many more times</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184909170050"/>
               <p>how I am, for I shall not tell you, as you seem to think it is not true. I can't help thinking that you are very unkind to me; as to your loving of me, John, it is all false and lies. Your note was not very kind, so you can't complain of mine: but as your time is so taken up with the nurse, I can't expect you to send to poor me; but never mind, as all things are for the best. I am very unhappy, John; why do you go with the nurse, so as I beg of you not? I am afraid that there is something wrong between you and her, and if that is the case, that is why you don't care for me. How do you think that I can love you if you love some one else? no, John, you don't seem to care for me as you did before you went there—why is that? because you have got some one else there, and if that is the case you shall have reason to be sorry for it. Please to send me an answer by return of post."—(Post-mark, 20 <hi rend="italic">June</hi>, 1849.) "Mr. Cock,—I received your letter yesterday, and wonder how you can say I sent you an unkind one. I think you are the most unnatural man that ever was, to think of your sending me back all across the fields, one of the coldest nights we have had; the beasts of the field would have more feeling for their young, and to say that you love him, you are a liar to say such a thing as to love my baby or myself. I shall not tell you, let him be as bad as he may. I shall not send for you, mind that. I should be glad if you would come to some arrangement with me not to come and see me at all, but allow me something as I am not to come near you, and when I do to be served like that. O, you beast! to come to me after you have been with your whore. You d—d devil; would to God you might be dead by the time this comes where you are; I feel that I should be glad never to see you again. You say in your letter 'that bonnet and shawl.' You know that you sent me to ask the price, John; I think as you have been made a father down here, and you can buy things for them, you may as well get her to make your shirts, for I shall not until I am treated as your wife by you and your <hi rend="italic">pals</hi>; so I tell you. If you wish to get rid of me, you need not serve me in that way. Perhaps you will think about what I am saying and let me know as soon as you can, if by return of post."—28<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, "Well John, you say you can't think I mean what I say about the money. I can tell you that I do, as I have not got any, as I told you in the last, and therefore hope you will send some. I am to get some powders for the dear child, and I have not got the money, so if anything happens to him you must blame yourself, as you will not send me any money. John, you must remember that I have had to pay 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for rent, and then to live out of it and buy things for the child and myself, which you know, but not 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. like you. I hope you will send me some, as I must have some. The dear boy is very ill; he has no teeth yet; I wish he had; I shall be glad. I should not send only to tell you that I have not got any, and you may believe me this time. I think you one of the most unkind men in the world, for you have got everything you wish for and don't think of poor us. Send by return."—30<hi rend="italic">th June</hi>, "Well Cock, so you don't mean to send any money. Well then, I shall come down and see your wh—; you d—d devil.

I shall come down, so I tell you, and shall let the people know what a man your master is, and his servants too, that your wife is not allowed to come to you.

The prosecutrix was brought there between two and three o'clock on Friday morning, 13th Sept.—she had a punctured wound over the left eye, and one or two lesser wounds below—the wound over the eye was not calculated to do mischief from the way in which it went—it was about a quarter of an inch deep—I should think it was not given with much force, or it would have gone in deeper—it passed between the coats of the eye and the bone above—if it had been a little lower it would have gone into the eye—the other two wounds were immediately beneath the eye—they were very small—I should say they were not such wounds as a key would make; it must have been some sharp instrument—I should think they must have been aimed at the eye—if it had been a blow with a key, it would have been a contused wound—it was a punctured wound—I have not the least doubt it was done by some sharp instrument, not a key.</p>

On 20th Aug. the prisoner came and said he wanted some plated dish-covers for Mr. Hooper's son—he was dressed as he is now—I suspected him, and said, "I will go with you," and asked where Mr. Hooper resided—he said, "Upper Thames-street"—I said, "Is it the son of Mr. Alder<lb/>man Hooper, of Queenhithe?"—he said, "Yes, "and that he was going to be married—I said, "Will you carry them?"—he said, "No, "and I called a porter—we went down Bread-street, and the prisoner seemed very fidgetty, and said he wanted to buy some twine—I said, "What for?"—he said Mr. Hooper commissioned him to buy twine—I said, "There is a shop, you can buy some"—he went in, came out directly, and said, "Can't you go with the covers yourself; do you think I am misleading you?"—I said, "No, but I am determined you shall go with me"—he said, "I want to buy my string first"—I asked him how long he had been in Mr. Hooper's employ—he said, "About two years"—I asked who Mr. Hooper was going to marry—he said, "A lady named Lee"—I gave him in charge—he was dressed as a trades-man's boy—Mr. Alderman Hooper does not live in Thames-street.</p>

The prisoner was foreman to Mr. Gregson, the contractor for the East India Dock Line, which is to pass over the Great Northern—at the part where it passes over, there is a temporary bridge of wood, and men were employed to carry earth across it to a place called the Tip, where it is thrown down—it was the prisoner's duty to look after the men—the drivers of the carts would be bound to attend to his orders, to go on or stop—on the morning this occurred, about twenty minutes to eight o'clock, a temporary shore under the bridge had been struck by the Great Northern people underneath—carts had not gone over the bridge after six, only a trace-horse—I was not there till six—about a quartet to eight I was informed by the people below that the bridge was unsafe—soon after<lb/>wards I saw two trucks laden with earth drawn by two horses approaching the bridge—I hallooed out, "Stop!"—the prisoner was about thirty or forty yard from me—I should say he could hear me—I was on the same side of the driver that he was—he said, "Go on, you b—r, never mind," three or four times—Dallen was with me—I do not think he called out, except to a labourer who was on the bridge, to stop the wagons from coming over, but he would not stop for him—he hallooed," Get out of the way, or else you will be run over"—that was after he called out to stop, and the prisoner said, "Go on"—the driver drove on, and when the trucks came on the bridge, it all came down on the under line—a beam of the bridge came down and a shore—a man named Richard Gumm was underneath—we knew him by the name of <persName id="t18490917-name-444" type="victimName">

                  </hi>. I manage the works for Mr. Jay. This bridge be<lb/>longed to the East India Dock Line—on 29th Aug. we were raising some uprights to support the bridge, from five o'clock in the morning—the carrying earth over the bridge, was carried on all night—I am not aware whether it was stopped at all—carts laden with earth passed over from six until about a quarter to eight—to put the new supports to the bridge we had to remove one shore—we had got the upright part of the way up the night before—we were obliged to remove the old one before putting the new one up—when we were about to remove the old one, notice was given to the people above that the bridge would be unsafe—I saw Leary on the bridge, and saw the two trucks approach—I heard some one on the bridge call out," Stop, stop! the bridge is unsafe!"—the prisoner was just behind the two trucks when the call was made—the driver attempted to stop, and the prisoner said, "Drive on, drive on, "and made use of a bad expression—before he said that, I saw Leary holding up his hands, and doing all in his power to stop the horses coming forward; in fact he had to scamper out of the way—a man was there who we employ, dressed as a policeman, to keep people back—he was above me, calling out to stop—he was sent by the foreman of the carpenters for the purpose—the prisoner has to see that the people get on with their work—I have heard Mr. Gregson give him orders to do so—I have seen the prisoner direct the men who were driving the trucks, and have seen them attend to his orders.</p>

BODKIN</hi>, <hi rend="italic">on behalf of the male prisoner, having obtained permission to withdraw his plea of not guilty, put in a demurrer to the indictment, and issue being thereupon joined, he proceeded to argue that in order to support a charge of this nature, the letter must contain such a clear undoubted threat, as to induce the prosecutors to part with their money from fear of personal injury; and that the demand must import on the face of it, some real or assumed power to enforce it. He contended that this letter contained no such demand; that it only amounted to a request, or a suggestion; and that as it contained no menace of a personal nature, it did not come within the statute.—See Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Pickford</hi>, 4 <hi rend="italic">Car. 7 Payne</hi>, 227, <hi rend="italic">and Rex</hi> v. <hi rend="italic">Carruthers, Vol.</hi> 20 <hi rend="italic">of Session Papers</hi>, p. 821.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>: <hi rend="italic">Then there must be a plea of Guilty. I contend that the judgment upon a demurrer is final, and I shall ask from your Lordships &amp; final judgment, leaving the prisoner to a Writ of Error.</hi>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. BALLANTINE</hi>: <hi rend="italic">I submit not; it is now part of the record, and must be disposed of. I contend that my friends by demurring admit the facts, and if they wish more conveniently to bring the matter before a Court of Error, the prisoner must plead Guilty, and then there must be a motion in arrest of judg<lb/>ment. I would not object to the demurrer being treated as a nullity; but if, having failed upon the demurrer, they now wish to try in the ordinary way, I object; and I contend that the Court has no power to allow the demurrer to be withdrawn. If a prisoner has pleaded Not Guilty, and is given in charge, is what way would your Lordships dispose of that, except by the finding of the Jury?

The exercise of that power is at the discretion of the Court. The practice has always been to allow a prisoner indicted for felony, if he fails upon a demurrer, to plead over; the original ground of that rule, was</hi> in favorem vitae; <hi rend="italic">but it is not to he said, because a felon is not liable to be executed, that he is to lose that privilege.

I can save you from degradation, from an immense loss of capital, and from perhaps something still dearer to you. I have been entrapped by a gang of cold-blooded, desperate villains, and hunted by them from the pinnacle of fortune to the lowest sink of iniquity; but should one syllable be known, or the slightest stir be made, my lift would pay the forfeit. I cannot, I will not allude to their vile and cruel machinations; my soul shudders to bear and see their evil and cursed designs; and though I am now suffering the most severe privations, I can endure them rather than be driven from the path of honour and honesty which I have hitherto supported. Will you pledge me your honour and faith, as you hope for mercy in heaven, never to make known one syllable of what I may communicate? and will you lend me your assistance to obtain an honest living by lending me means sufficient to get some business, and trust to my honour and honesty for its repayment? If you will comply with these terms, I will save you, or lose my life in the attempt; but you must be punctual. You are marked out for victims to these accursed villains. A few hundreds will carry me from their reach, which if you accord me will save you from destruction and the loss of thousands—if you accept my proposal, put a sen<lb/>tence in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of to-morrow and Wednesday morning, as follows: 'B.O.N. will accede to the terms proposed, and will send part of the means to any place which may be named.' 3d Sept.

               <p>honourably with me, and not by any means deceive me, or allow any spy to watch me, I will save you or perish in the attempt, though I hazard my life in so doing.

I am fully assured that 20,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. would not cover this horrid catastrophe, which would not only stop your bank for a time, but perhaps for ever, as the books would be all destroyed. The match, that most dreadful and last resource, has been contemplated by the <hi rend="italic">cracksman</hi> or captain of this most horrid gang, which I fervently pray to be relieved from. I have never yet, so help me God! done a deed I am afraid or ashamed of, and the only way I can privately obtain means will be the following. At the London end of Kensington-gardens, on the Knightsbridge-side, there is a dyke slope, which divides the gardens from the park, and a carriage road, where the roads meet as you turn to ride or drive across the bridge. It is a short distance from the first lodge, where the keeper remains, within the gardens. On look<lb/>ing up the dyke, you will see large iron pipes which convey water into the pond—a large-elm tree stands in the middle of this road, betwixt the park and gardens—there is sufficient room under the first pipe to conceal a small bag. If you will therefore send a man you can confide in, and lodge beneath that pipe 250 sovereigns, unseen by mortal eye, I swear most solemnly by Almighty God, to prevent the evil; if, when I have completed my task and informed you all is safe, or denounce the villains, you will let me have 250 more, which, if God prosper me, I will repay with gratitude, as I cannot get into business for less than 500 to obtain a respectable living. Let the money be lodged to-morrow, Saturday-morning, by half-past eleven o'clock, but not one moment sooner, and all shall be well with you; but if I am at all deceived in any possible way, all must fall upon yourselves."</p>

We also agree to allow you five per cent. on any upholstery, funerals, decoration, &amp;c., introduced or obtained by you, when-ever it shall amount to 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or upwards—your engagement is to commence on the day of February next, and in the event of either party requiring to give notice, two clear months' notice is to be given."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">YOU</hi> say you received that about two years ago? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Two years and three-quarters—I received it about the time I received this letter—I had some conversation with him as to the business he was to be employed in—he was to undertake the management of the agency business—that was at the time of his coming to us, I think before the writing of this letter—I do not know whether I saw him on the subject after I sent him the letter—my brother, who is here, saw him first, and frequently afterwards, and he advised me to accede—in the course of our business we let houses for gentlemen, and the prisoner was in the habit of collecting the rents for them—my brother used to collect them occasionally—on the evening of 25th Aug. Mr. Liddell called on me—in consequence of what he said, I said to the pri<lb/>soner," Have you seen Mr. Liddell?"—he said he had, and he gave him Mrs. Burgoyne's check for the rent that morning—Mrs. Burgoyne had been occupying Mr. Liddell's house, but had left it—I do not know the date, but I believe it was some time in Aug.—I afterwards saw Mr. Liddell, and after that saw the prisoner again, told him I had seen Mr. Liddell, and what he had said to me was false, for he had never received the check at all—the</p>

Q.</hi> Do you recollect the case of a person who got into a tenement of yours by some false representations, and ran away? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not recollect—we had a clerk, named Reader—I do not recollect hearing my brother say to the prisoner, with reference to such a transaction, "This is a bad job of Trutch's; we shall lose 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it, and that will knock down your share"—I do not recollect saying anything to the prisoner about Trutch's running away—I swear I did not say," This is a bad job of Trutch's; we shall lose 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by it, and you will lose your share"—I do not recollect it, but I will not swear it did not pass—I do not recollect the prisoner saying, in reply," Never mind; the sharpest people are deceived sometimes, and we shall soon recover the loss by other jobs"—I will not swear it did not pass—the prisoner was to have one-third of the money made by the business, and the firm the other two.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you net, before the division into thirds, deduct any losses that occurred in the course of the transaction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We have never deducted any<lb/>thing yet—it has never been settled up—we did not deduct his share of the loss of Trutch's business, we never settled—we have not arranged it in any way—I do not know that the prisoner was to lose his share of it, nor do I know that he was not—we used to give him 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week, to draw on account—that was on account of his third—I do not know that he received any salary but that—all he has received has been on account of his third—I have not represented him as Mr. Mares—if a gentleman came and asked for Mr. Mares I asked the nature of his business, and if he came concerning a house, I have shown him to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE WILLIAMS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">I have great difficulty now in saying that you must not show the exact terms of the agreement.

               <p>by spitting in my face—I spoke rather rash to her—she said she would do for me, and she took a knife from her pocket and stabbed it in my arm, and ran across the road—this was in the street in which she was in the habit of keeping her stall, but she had no stall at that time—my arm bled—she ran into the house opposite—she came to the window of the house and said she was sorry it went into my arm only, and did not <hi rend="italic">go</hi> into my heart—I had not followed her about or abused her at all—I had not seen her since that night week—I had not torn her bonnet—I believe her bonnet fell off in the street as she ran across the road after she had stabbed me—I had not touched her in any way before she stabbed me, but no doubt she did it in a passion—I hope you will look over it.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Jones.</hi> The prosecutor said there were two pieces of board, and now he says three; I had no portmanteau; if he saw me with it, why did not he bring the policeman and take me? he knew where I lived; he is a bad character; I used to be a bad character, but I have reformed. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> After we had been to the back of the 'Change, I went to Flower-and-Dean-street—I said, "That is the door where he lives;"—the officers went back—I went up and saw two women; they said there was the cholera in the room—he was taken in that house on Sunday night—he made a kick at me, and said, "I wish I had kicked you in the privates"—I am not a bad character; I work very hard with my father, and the officers know it—Jones took my brother out, and my brother has got three months—I have been to his house for my brother, and he said he would kick me out.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a watchman, in the employ of the London Dock Company. On the afternoon of 17th Sept., I went, in consequence of information, to the jetty of the docks—I looked under a tarpaulin which covered some sugar, and I saw a matted bag of tea, and a short time after<lb/>wards I saw the prisoner on board a ship, the stern of which was close to the jetty—I concealed myself, and about half-past four o'clock I saw the prisoner crawling on his hands and knees between the tarpaulin and the casks of sugar—I then saw him with the bag of tea in his hand—I stopped him—I found a quantity of tea loose—I took it up, and took the prisoner to the office.</p>

I was in company with Huggett, near the Mansion House, at about a quarter-past two o'clock, and saw the prisoners there in company; they walked towards the Mansion House, turned down Charlotte-row, remained five minutes, then went to Lombard-street, through Pope's Head-alley, into Cornhill; then through 'Change-alley into Gracechurch-street and Lombard-street; Bannister then went into Mrs. Sebright's shop, leaving Foster outside, in front of the shop—they had before stopped at the corner of Birchin-lane about five minutes—when Bannister came out she passed close by Foster, who remained look<lb/>ing about till Bannister got out of my sight—in about a minute Foster left the shop and went in the same direction as Bannister—I then went into the</p>

In June last year a book similar to these was left at my house; a few days after, a person, who I believe was Henning, called—I paid him 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and said I would give him more another time—I was in a hurry, and just glanced at the names—I gave it him think<lb/>ing it was a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> society and seeing these names as patrons and committee—he gave me this receipt (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it was shown to Henning at the police-court, and he admitted it to be his—I paid another subscription this year, but I cannot find the receipt—I believe I paid it to Roberts. <hi rend="italic">Henning.

Henning came there on 22d Nov., said he belonged to the Animals' Friend Society, and asked me if I had an office to let, that he was removing from the Animals' Friend Society at the West Strand, as other parties required the room—No. 18, Strand, is in the West Strand—I let him have the counting-house at 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a quarter, until I got him a room—he said it was to carry out the Animals' Friend Society—he subsequently asked me to let him have a large room for the committee-meeting—no committee ever met there, and there was never any society there except Henning—he left me a receipt, and asked me, if any-body came, to receive the subscription—I believe I did so, not above once or twice—I afterwards let him two rooms—there was a bed in one—he might have slept there once or twice, but he did not in general.</p>

I live at 22, Strand, and also occupy No. 18, part of which was formerly let to the Animals' Friend Society, of which Mr. Gompertz was the manager—I recollect Henning calling on me in May last—he said Mr. Gompertz was not going to continue the management of the society, and he wanted an office—it was arranged that we should receive letters as we had done for Mr. Gompertz—I thought it was a continuation of Mr. Gompertz's society—there was never any committee or society held—I think the agree<lb/>ment is dated 26th May—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>).</p>

On Monday night, 20th Aug., I placed myself in a house commanding a view of Mr. Cohen's premises, about twenty yards off—at eleven o'clock the prisoners came down the street—I had known them for months before, and am sure they are the same people—I am not mistaken in any of them—they passed me several times for about twenty minutes—about twenty minutes past eleven they went up to Mr. Cohen's premises, and were fumbling at the door—I saw their arms working—Pearce and Peacock appeared in conversation behind the other two—there was a pause, and the door went in with a report as if forced, and the whole four left the door quickly, not in the direction I was—in a few minutes they returned, and Cooper and Jones went into the house, leaving Pearce and Peacock on the opposite side, six or seven yards off—when they had been in a minute or two, I heard an exclamation, and saw Pearce and Peacock run away in the same direction—in a minute afterwards, Cooper and Jones ran out of the house—Cooper was fifteen or twenty yards in advance—I saw Jones taken by Sergeant Kelly, on which Cooper turned back, and when</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, at Camberwell. I saw the prosecutor that evening—he had an extensive wound on his right arm, about four inches long, penetrating through the muscles to the bone, and there was a wound of a more superficial character on the back of his right hand—the depth of the wound on the arm was about a quarter of an inch—it extended under the arm where the muscle is—if it had been a little higher, it would have divided the <hi rend="italic">brachial</hi> artery, which would have been very serious—probably death would have followed before assistance could have been rendered—the hemorrhage would have been so great—I should say the knife</p>

               <p>had gone in with great force—a knife like this is quite calculated to make such a wound—the wound is not healed now—it went outside the arm—if it had been inside, it would probably have been fatal—it appeared to me to have been done in the way of a chop down—when it hit the bone it slid down into the muscles—the bone was simply cut upon.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I never had an angry word with the man; I have no ill-will towards him: I never struck him with my hand or a knife; I had no knife in my possession, but the little knife with a broken blade; I never knew there was a knife in the barrow—I was perfectly sober, and knew what I was doing—I was returning home, and sat down in front of the Rose and Thistle; Peacock came out, and I spoke to him; he then spoke to Bush, and said to him, "Do you hear how this fellow is going on;" he said, "He is talking as his belly guides him;" I said, "Is that <hi rend="italic">Bob?"</hi> he said, "Yes, it is, why don't you come into this house? "I said, "That is my business;" he said if I came up the steps he would kick me down; I said, that was more than him master could do; he struck me with his left hand; I called the policeman, and told him to take him in charge; he said he did not see the blow struck, and I must take a summons: Bush then struck me with his right hand; I said, "It is no use to go on so, come to Ball's field, and I will settle it;" I said that, meaning to get away; I went on to my own house, and went into the garden: he came up and said, "Are you not coming out?"

I said, "No, I have not had one for seven or eight hours;" he said, "This has been done by some sharp instrument;" I have none but what I use; there was a harrow there, with some flowers in bloom in it; the policeman came and found the knife there; as to striking the man, or having any animosity against him, I declare to God I never had; it is a spite from the landlord of the house, because I lodged an information against it, because the parties who came fron there late at night have destroyed my property; he told me it should be the worst day's work I ever did in my life, and it has come to this; I have tried to do all I could for Bush; when he was lying about, I offered to lend him a suit of clothes to go to get a situation: I gave him three pairs of shoes, and have given him pints of beer—I had never any intention to strike him orany man with a knife—I have been in Camberwell eight or nine years, and had a good character—I have a witness here.</p>

                  </hi>. I live with my father, Lewis Winchester, in Clarendon-place, Vassal-road, Brixton; it is in Lambeth parish. Last Friday night, before I went to bed, I fastened the house—the front door was closed and bolted with two bolts—the staircase-window was shut down, but I am not sure that it was fastened—there was a brown great coat and a hat of my father's in the passage—my father is a tall man, about five feet nine or ten inches—in consequence of an alarm, I came down at four o'clock in the</p>

               <p>morning—I found the street-door, the parlour-door, and the staircase-window, all wide open—they had all been closed on the previous night—I went up-stairs to an upper window, and called the police—I heard some footsteps going in the direction of Cowley-road, which is sixteen houses above our bouse—as far as I could judge, the footsteps were about six houses from our house—I missed the coat and hat about six o'clock—this is my father's coat—he wears his coats rather long, below the knees.</p>

On Friday morning, 14th Sept., I was on duty in Cowley-road—about a quarter before four o'clock my attention was attracted to some footsteps—I looked in the direction of the footsteps, and saw a person behind me crossing the road by a lamp—he was about 200 yards off, coming after me from the Vassall-road towards Brixton-hill—I went to the spot, and saw him go into a front garden, and there is a dark passage between two houses—I could not see any one when I first went up—I went in at the gate, and heard some one rustle—when I got to the end of the passage, the prisoner rushed out and jumped over a fence in front of a gentleman's house—he ran up the road towards Brixton-hill—I ran after him and caught him—as he was running, he pulled off a great coat, about fifteen yards from where I first saw him in the garden, and left the coat in the Cowley-road—I took him in the Brixton-road—I asked why he ran away—he said he had just asked the policeman the way to the Elephant and Castle—I said, "Where were you when I passed?"—he said, "I hid myself; it was not d—d likely I would come out to let you see me"—another officer came up, and I told him to go to the Cowley-road, where he would find a coat—the prisoner said he meant to have a d—d fine harvest that night, only he was taken in—my brother officer returned, and said he could not find the coat—I took the pri<lb/>soner back to the dark passage, and told my brother officer to strike a light—we found this crow-bar in that passage, where the prisoner had been—the pri<lb/>soner said, when it was found, that he knew'nothing about it—he said he had met two young Jews, and they lent him this coat to put on, and they said, "You had better hide yourself in this passage, the policeman is coming, and he will take us up for being out late in the morning"—I noticed the coat he bad had on was too long for him; it was down to his heels.</p>

The <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was driven about for four hours and a half. I suppose I was asleep; I fell into a sort of stupor. I was awoke by feeling something at my pocket, and found the left-hand trowsers pocket torn down, and I saw Murphy had a piece of wash-leather in his hand, in which I bad fifty sovereigns tied up when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> Murphy gave it to the other prisoner, who was driving. It was a "Hanson" <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and Murphy passed it up through the door in the roof. I told Myers to return it to me, and I said 1 would call the police. He pretended not to know what I meant. I called out for the police, and Murphy immediately laid hold of me to prevent my calling out, and then jumped out of the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> Myers immediately drove the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> on, whipping his horse, but I jumped out and followed Murphy, who went up Joiner-street, and stood against a wall, looking round, and said he did not know me, and asked me what I wanted. I gave him in charge. The <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was driven off, as fast as it could be, but a person followed it, and Myers was brought back. The money was tied up in a piece of wash-leather, and I am sure it was in my left-hand trowsers pocket when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I must have fallen into the stupor the moment I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> The last house I had been in, was halfway between Deptford and London Bridge, and I had walked from there to where I took the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I was quite sensible when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I recollect calling the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and, to the best of my know<lb/>ledge, about five o'clock. It was not dark. I have no recollection of going to a public-house, or getting out of the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> The first thing I recollect is when I got out after Murphy. I do not remember going down a court, and the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man coming after me. I do not remember being knocked down by Mur<lb/>phy after the constable took him. As far as I can recollect, Murphy was standing on the road near the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and got in as a friend of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man's. I had not been with him before. I had not seen him till I called the <hi rend="italic">cab."</hi> (<hi rend="italic">A subsequent deposition of the witness teas also read, as follows: "</hi> I have since found that it must have been about half-past seven instead of half-past four that I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> Neither of the prisoners were known to me before this. I had been drinking brandy-and-water with my son-in-law; we had five or six glasses. I was not sober. I told Myers where to drive. I had been saving up my money, and my wife being out of town, I did not like to leave it at home. I had not pulled it out of my pocket. I have no knowledge of taking the prisoners into a public-house. I found a hole through the rim of my hat, and a bruise on my chest")—(<hi rend="italic">A further deposition was also read: "</hi> I remember feeling my money in</p>

               <p>my pocket when I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I went out at ten o'clock that morning with my son-in-law, and went to the Commercial Docks. We had a pint of beer going, and went to the same house returning, the Gregorian Arms and we had five or six glasses there. It was about two o'clock when I went there. I don't remember going anywhere after that, nor what time it was when I left there, nor seeing Murphy till I called the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> I could walk well enough when I left the Gregorian Arms. I have no recollection of anything that happened after I got into the <hi rend="italic">cabt</hi> till I found my trowsers being meddled with, and that roused me. I had the brace buttoned upon the button of my left-hand trowsers pocket, which made it difficult to unbutton that pocket; it was necessary to undo the brace first.")—I cannot tell which is true, whether I got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at five or at half-past seven—I cannot say how long I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I did not state before the Magistrate that I was four hours and a half in the cab—I was sworn, and what I said was taken down—it was read over to me before I signed it—I was asked whether it was true or false, or whether I had anything to add or correct, and after I had kissed the book I signed it—I cannot say how long I was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I have no knowledge of pulling the bag and 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. out of my pocket—I did not know I pulled it out at Mr. Evans's, and put it on the counter—the first I recollect of being in Murphy's company was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I was present when the witnesses were examined, and heard I was in his company from two to four o'clock—I have sworn, to the best of my knowledge—I do not recollect that Murphy knocked me down—I do not know that the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>man himself drove to the station-house—I was not there—I have heard that he drove a party there—I have no recollection when Murphy and me got out of the <hi rend="italic">cabt</hi> or of Myers coming after us, and charging us as being two persons who wanted to evade paying.</p>
