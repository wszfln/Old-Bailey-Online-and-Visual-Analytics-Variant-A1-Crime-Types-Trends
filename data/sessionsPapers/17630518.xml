I undressed myself, and took out my watch; she took it in her hand, and laid it down on the table; I took and hung it up where I usually hang it by my bedside. I got into bed, and said, it she did not come in quickly, I should fall asleep. As I said so it was, I fell asleep; when I awaked in the morning, she and my watch were gone, and also my handkerchief, which I had lent her to tie about her head. I never could meet with her again, till the 21st, when I four'd her in Field-lane. I asked her to go along with me and have some supper; I brought her to the Cock in Fleet-market; then I asked her, how long she had had the handkerchief she had on? she said, you are joking, one handkerchief may be like another. Then I said, if I am not mistaken, you are the very woman that robbed me of my watch. She denied it. I said, I would swear it, and was going to get a constable; she began to cry, and told me she had pawned it in.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180003"/> Aldersgate street, and after that sold it to

She said she knew of a place, and could she sell a watch that was her husband's she could get some cloaths, so as to enable her to go to that service; she said it was in pawn for a guinea. I went with her to the three Blue Balls by Aldersgate, and paid a guinea, and 6 d. for the interest, and gave her 8 s. 6 d. besides for it; the night after she was brought to me by a constable, and I produced the watch.</p>

            . Mr. Gapper had been at my house in Cannon-street, and we were going together, he had hold of my right arm with his left; he started, and turned about, and said his pocked was picked; this was under Newgate) there was the prisoner with his handkerchief in his hand, it was so momentary I cannot tell which hand he had it is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner say which way he came by it?</p>
               <p>Manning. No, he did not then, but about 10 minutes after, when we had him in the Fountain tavern, he said two boys ran by him, and threw it upon his hand.</p>

               <p>I had been on the other side the water to see a kinsman, going home through Newgate there were two boys and a man; I had been drinking a little more than did me good. I was throwing my hands about, the gentleman turned round, and said, his pocket was pick'd. The handkerchief was thrown upon the cape of my coat; the gentleman said, you rascal, you have got my handkerchief. I had not power to speak at that time. The two boys ran, one on one side, and the other on the other, of the gentlemen. I said, the handkerchief is none of mine, if it is yours you are welcome to it.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you ever see those sacks again?</p>
               <p>Burton. I saw them burnt at Baylis's mother's house.</p>
               <p>Baylis. You burnt them, you did.</p>
               <p>Q. How did you get them again?</p>
               <p>Burton. I do not know, but I saw them on the same day under Baylis's arm. Jones charged us with taking malt, and we were both taken up on the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What advantage did you get by all this?</p>
               <p>Burton. Rust and Baylis came to me at the Horse-shoes, and told me they had got 5 s. of Mr. Beaden; they gave me 2 s. and Baylis had 2 s. and Rust kept the other one; the two sacks came to 10 s. but I never had a farthing more of that; but I received of Mr. Beaden 5 s. about four months ago, for a sack of oats; there had been carried two sacks, and Rust had received 5 s. in part, and I went and received the other 5 of him; he was then at the Swan in Arundel-street, when he came to the door and paid me, he said he had rather have no more, because if it was found out it would blast his character, and ruin him for ever.</p>

I was at Justice Welch's when Baylis was charged with being concerned in taking two sacks of malt, the property of the prosecutors, he acknowledged he did carry one of them from the grainery to Mr. Beaden's stable. Mr Beaden was not at home when we went to his house, I left word I wanted to speak with him, and about an hour after he came and surrendered himself to me.</p>

The prisoner came to me on the 20th of April, late in the evening, with twelve weather-sheep, he said he was going with them to Smithfield; and one was tired, he asked me, if I would buy it? he seemed to be at a loss to know what price to ask. I asked him, if he would sell them all? he was still at a loss what to ask. I had a suspicion he stole them, I put them into my yard. At first he said, they were his father's, afterwards he said, they were his brother's and his; he said, his father lives at Catridge-green, three miles beyond Chesham. I detained him. The sheep appeared dusty, as if they had come some distance. The prisoner was sent to prison on the 21st; on the 24th

The sheep were in our ground on the 19th about 5 in the evening, and we missed them the next<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180006"/> morning between 9 and 10. I saw the fence was pulled up, and the stakes thrown by, and the sheep had been drove out at the place. I went in search of them cross the country, and found them in Mr. Harcote's grass. I am very positive they are my master's property, they were mark'd with J. M. in pitch on the near side, and a readle mark on their shoulders. The prisoner was then committed, I never saw him till now.</p>

The two prisoners lodged in my house as man and wife a fortnight and three days; when they were before the Magistrate, they said they were not married, and gave in these their names. The things mentioned in the indictment were taken out of a book-case which stood on a chest of drawers in their room, which was not let to them for their use, which I believe was lock'd, but I am not sure. I missed them the last day of April. I had given them warning the Saturday before, they went away directly; the woman was first taken, and, upon being charged with taking the things, the man begged of the woman, if she knew any thing of them, to confess Then she said she had taken and pawned them at Mr. Farmer's, in Jewin-street, where we found them.</p>

On the 4th of last month, in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our shop, we were very busy, she asked to look at some printed cotton; she gave us great reason to suspect she had stolen some thing We told her before she went out, she must be searched. I took her into a private place, and called my maid down to search her. She had some little pockets under her apron, and in one of them was a southsea handkerchief, the maid took up her gown behind, and there dropt from her 5 yards of printed cotton. (Produced in court.) The handkerchief I believe to be my property, but I do not swear to that; I know the cotton to be our property by the pattern, size, and the sag end with the person's name of whom I had it.</p>

            . I went to Smithfield, and saw the prisoner on this horse; I took him by the leg and the horse by the bridle, and asked the prisoner how he came by him? He said, he had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180008"/> him of a man at the lower end of the market: I took him to the Bell inn, and sent for a constable. I asked him if he knew the man he had him of; he said he did not; he was carried to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he offer to sell him?</p>
               <p>Dendy. I do not know that he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say that it was his own horse?</p>
               <p>Dendy. Not as I heard. Before my Lord-Mayor the next morning he made another sort of a story, but I cannot tell what very well.</p>
               <p>Q. Then how do you know that it was another sort of a story?</p>
               <p>Dendy. He said he had him of a man at Epsom, who gave him a shilling to ride him to market.</p>

            . I was going by the prosecutor's house on the 18th of April, some of the neighbours said, they heard a man breaking the house, I went in and found the prisoner in a lower room; I led him out of the house, and saw him drop a handkerchief after he was out, it fell from his breeches.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Whitmel. It was day light; a woman took up the handkerchief and gave it to me. I cannot say this is the same, it having been out of my custody. I searched him and found nothing upon him.</p>

I have nobody to speak for me but God Almighty.</p>

On the 28th of March; about one in the morning, I was coming home towards Charing-cross, where I live; I was accosted by three men, two of them dressed in sailors jackets, the other in common cloaths; this was near York-buildings in the Strand, the prisoner was one of them; they surrounded me, and talked to each other, I could not tell what, in a mumbling way. They said, give us something to drink. I said, I could not then, I was going home. They insisted upon it very strongly; I thought it most prudent to comply with three such desperate fellows, (as they kept very close to me) to pass my own door, which is opposite Northumberland-house, fearing if I should knock, and have it opened, they, by seeing valuable things there, might knock me down, and force into the house. I said, I would treat them at the first house I came to; they obliged me to go up the Haymarket I was fearful to run from them, fearing they would follow me, and use me ill. I saw a cellar open in the Haymarket, on the right hand side, which seemed to have a decent appearance; I proposed to treat them there; they said, no, they would have it at a house of there own at the top of Piccadilly, at the Red Lion. We went all there, I ordered some liquor, a half crown bowl of punch, I think they called for slip: they forced me to the upper end of the place; there were a great number of people there, coachmen and chairmen, it is a night house. As I was sitting with my head leaning on my hand, the prisoner took my watch from my fob. I took it out of his hand, and said, what do you mean to rob me? I got out of the house as soon as I could, I believe I had been there about an hour; I made for home as fast as I could, betwixt <placeName id="t17630518-14-crimeloc84">Panton-street</placeName>

Said they, do not chatter, Sir, come, come, deliver. They took my watch, a quarter guineas, and 2 s. from my pocket, and struck me several blows with a stick, one on my thigh, and others on my hands. One of them said, don't use him ill, you know that he has been a good natured fellow, but he has got a ring, and by G d we will have it. I had at that time my glove on, but they had seen it I believe in the house; they took it, it was a diamond cluster ring, 9 large and 8 small ones; then they left me, and I went home, the ring was worth at least 22 l.</p>

On Monday morning the 25th of April, between 3 and 4 o'clock, I detected the prisoner in the field with a truss of hay on his back, he made his escape from me; I catched him again, then he said if I would let him go he would leave the hay. I carried him to the watch-house, there he offered me half a crown if I would let him go. I had watched him, and found two other trusses where he had laid them in the field. Before Justice Fielding he owned he stole the three trusses from out of his master's barn at Marybone that morning, and that he had sold two trusses to a man before.</p>

            . The prisoner came into a house where I was, about two hundred yards from Mrs. Young's house, about ten minutes after she had lost her money; he bid me 5 s. for my wig I have now on, and wanted me to give him 3 d. out of a quarter guinea, which he had in his hand.</p>

               <p>Q. to Prosecutrix. Did he offer 14 s. for things in your house that day?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. He was looking over some stockings and a hat belonging to a woman; she did say he offered her that money, but that was after I had lost mine. He denied having any money when he was taken, but he was searched before Sir

Having company to attend, we were obliged to stay on Tuesday morning, the 10th of May, between 12 and 1; there were three of us, Tibbutts, Lambert, and myself, we begged a bit of a link of the landlord at the Rose to light us over the fields; we got about twenty yards on this side of the posts, there three men or more met us, the first came up to me and said, give me the link; I said, what would you do with the link? The second came up and d - d my eyes, and said, give me the link; and immediately took it out of my hand and put it out, and two of them knocked or shoved me down.</p>
               <p>Q. Before the link was put out, did you observe the faces of any of them?</p>
               <p>Corin. All I know is the second man had a striped waistcoat. I know nothing of the faces of either of them. One of them held me, while the other riffled my pockets, after that they took my hat and wig; I got up, they said, d - n your eyes, if you don't go that way, we will blow your brains out. I walked a little way, and hearing people talk, I could not tell my way, I cam e again in the midst of them.</p>
               <p>Q. What money did you loose?</p>
               <p>Corin. I had five single six-pences and half a guinea in my pocket; I had none when I came to the light. When I came to them again, they swore at me in the same manner, and said, they would blow my brains out, if I came there again. Another said, d - n his eyes, he has got silver buckles, we will have them.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure they were the same men?</p>
               <p>Corin. I was in such confusion, I can't tell. Two of them seized me and held up my legs, one at a time, and took shoes and all; then I did not know them; when I left them, I durst not for some time make a noise. At last I saw my companions at the corner of Cavendish-square, I was calling out, I did not know where I was, till a light came, they came to me with two watchmen. At my getting up from the ground I found a cap, which we thought to be a light horse-man's cap, that I left with Justice Fielding, we went there the same day. The prisoners were taken before Justice Pell, I went there; the Justice asked me, if I could swear to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180013"/> either of them? I said, I could not; there was also Smith the evidence. All I knew of them was, the man that took the link out of my hand had a striped waistcoat on, (the evidence had such a one) and he declared, he took the link out of my hand, and that Chapman and he were the persons that robbed me; and he said, Chapman had then my shoes on, I saw them, but do not swear to them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get any of your things again?</p>

            . I came from sea last Christmas, having been there about seven years. I have been acquainted with the three prisoners about five weeks; I became first acquainted with them in St. Giles's, at one Mr. Porter's, the King's Arms, a public house, they are all sailors; we just went out upon a frolick together that night.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did you meet that night?</p>
               <p>Smith. We met there between 9 and 19 accidentally; we said, we would go out together to see what we could do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do, what?</p>
               <p>Smith. Rob the first we came a-thort, as soon as we came out of the house we declared this. Lilley and Forsit had each a stick: we went to the New Road, there we robbed two country-carts. Then we went into Church-street, near Maynard-street, and had half a pint of gin, this might be about 11 o'clock. Then we went to Marybone fields, and met with these three waiters, between 12 and 1 o'clock. Lilley was the foremost man, he ran to the man with the link in his hand, and said, give me the link; the other said, what will you do with the link? then I said, d - n your eyes, give me the link; he made no resistance, but gave it me. I gave him a shove and hove him down, I took half a crown out of his pocket and gave it to Forsit, they were sixpences I believe, I took his hat, after that Lilley and I took both his shoes; the others were busy with the other two waiters; Forsit took his wig, and had the hat too from my head; Forsit got his buckles, and Lilley his shoes. After we had done this, we all went to Holborn together to the George, a night-house, I never was there before in my life; we staid there better than an hour drinking, and went from thence to the house of one Cowman, I don't know the sign, just by the Tower-goal, we got there about 5 o'clock in the morning, we staid there pretty near an hour; then they all went out of the house but me. Lilley left his stick behind, the landlord took notice of its being bloody, and took me in custody, I was carried to prison; when I came before Justice Pell, then I told who the others were.</p>

            . I live in Maynard-street, St. Giles's, at the King's Arms. I know all the prisoners and the evidence, they all drank at times at my house. I have seen them at sundry times for six weeks past, sometimes they have drank together and sometimes at separate boxes; they are sailors. I cannot charge my memory with the day, but I think last Tuesday was son-night, in the evening, or thereabouts, was the last time I saw them. Ward is a musician, he has used to play on the violin. I remember the evidence wore a striped jacket. Chapman and Smith used to be often together. Ward lodged facing me; I can't say I ever saw him in their company any farther than playing them a tune.</p>

               <p>Mr. Cowman. I keep the Horns and Horseshoe, a public house in Rosemary-lane. The three prisoners and evidence were all together in my house, between 5 and 6 in the morning, on Wednesday was se'nnight; I never knew any thing of them before, they called for a pot of purl; Lilley called for a pint of beer by himself in a different box, and seemed to be in a passion with the other two prisoners, he paid me for his beer at his coming in; Forsit had a hat in his hand, which he offered to a man to sell; he asked 6 s. for it; he and that man sat together four or five minutes; the man and he went out together, and I believe were gone near a quarter of an hour; he came back again; I did not see the hat after that; they staid about an hour in my house; he paid for the purl; they went away and Smith staid alone, he would not go with them; they staid wrangling at the door; I begged of him to go along with his company, he would not go, but called me names, and said I had robbed him. Forsit hit Smith with his stick across his back, and wanted him to come along; still he would not, but said I had robbed him; I said of what? he said I want my stick; some people shov'd him out at the door; he said he would not go, he would have his revenge of me, I had robbed him of a halfpenny; I said, if you will not go, I'll charge an officer with you, I do not half like you; he shov'd in again, then I sent for an officer, and gave him in charge. Lilley left his stick in the box, it was split a good way down, and it then seemed to me as if there was blood upon it. (Producing a large stick.) I took Smith before Justice Pell; he said, he worked in the brick-field, he could not tell his master's name for a good while. The Justice<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180014"/> was going to commit him, and said, if you know of any thing that has been bad, or of any body that has been robbed, or if you have been in company where any ill is done, I'll admit you an evidence. Smith began to open directly; he told the Justice, he and the others left Maynard-street about 9 or 10 o'clock over night, and went all four together somewhere by Tyburn-road, he could not tell the place; that they met three men with two carts, one was riding in one, the other driving, they took from one 3 farthings, and from another 7 s. and after that they met with three men coming over the fields, one of them had a link in his han, they looked upon them to be gentlemen's servants, that he took the link out of the man's hand, and shov'd him down and robbed him of half a crown; he told the names of the three prisoners. I saw Lilley come by my door about noon that day, he was secured soon after, and the others were taken the next day.</p>

I was along with Corin when he was robbed coming from Marybone; they came and knocked me down I lay sometime on the ground senseless; (he shewed a wound in his head) this they gave me, this was just after the link was out, I do not remember any of the people; I lost hat, wig, buckles, shoes, and all the money I had in my pocket, which was some silver and halfpence, I cannot be positive how much; they wanted to strip me naked, I struggled for my coat; I don't know what they did to Lambert and Corin: I saw the prisoners before the Justices, they denied it.</p>
               <p>Zepheniah Lambert. I was one of the three waiters, we had borrowed a link, and were coming home, and were got about twenty yards into the fields, about three or four men met us; one of them came up and said, d - n your eyes, give me the link, to Corin; then another came with a striped waistcoat on, and said, d - n your eyes, give us the link, and snatched it out of his hand, and put it out. I had a large stick in my hand, I struck at him, upon which, another of them knocked me down; they being busy upon my other two companions, and it being dark I made off from them, they took nothing from me; I cannot swear to any of them; I saw the prisoners before Justice Pell, where they denied it.</p>

            . A young man came to Justice Fielding from Justice Pell last Tuesday was se'nnight, about 11 in the forenoon, with a paper, and three mens names upon it, Lilley, Ward, and Forsit; at that time Sir John was busy with the waiters, who came to give an account how they had been robbed. Justice Pell sent word that Ward and Forsit were at the King's arms in Maynard-street, or just by; Newton and I went to see if we could see them, the waiters went along with us; we took Ward in his lodgings before he had got his cloaths on; we brought him to Justice Fielding, there he owned that he, Lilley, Smith, and Forsit, were all together in Marybone fields last night, and robbed three men there. The cap was produced to him, he was asked if that cap was not lost in the fields; he said. yes, and that it belonged to Lilley. After that I took the keeper of Bridewell, and the other man that knew Forsit, and went to the King's arms again; the man that knew him pointed to him, saying, that was the man. He was sitting with a pint of beer before him, I laid hold of him directly; he was very resolute at first, and said he knew nothing of the matter; we found a will and powers in his pocket that belongs to one Williams on board a man of war. We brought him to Sir

On Saturday morning last, between 9 and 10 at night, the prisoner came into my shop under a pretence of buying a shirt-buckle; I shewed him some, I saw him conceal one in his hand, which was a garnet one set in gold; I looked so close after him that he could not put it down again without my seeing him; he said, he had one at home he would make an exchange with me, he said it cost 17 s. He went out of the shop, and told me he would bring it; I followed him, and overtook him in the passage to the Post-office, I took him by the collar and led him back to my shop, and said, he had stole a shirt-buckle from me and I should punish him. A constable was going by, I called him, and gave charge of him. The prisoner said, he hoped I would not expose him, and begged for mercy, and would have down'd on his knees in the shop, and put down two shirt-buckles on the counter; I only saw him take one, but he had taken a paste one set in silver, and a garnet one set in gold, I know them both to be mine, by my private mark.

I went to one of them, the Black-moor's-head in Germain-street; the woman there said, she had lived with her about a month or five weeks, but that she was not there then. I sat in the coach, and a boy came to me and said, a person wanted me at the Feathers at the top of the street, I ordered the coach there, there was a great mob, a girl came out and said, madam, she is here, and your servant has got her; I went into the tap-room, being lame and sat down, there was Mrs. Ferne, the mistress of the house, who said the girl was here, swearing a great oath, she knew she was a thief, and had taxed her with it last night; the prisoner was up stairs, I went up to her, with the footman, and another man, I said, so, Kitty, how came you to do so? she answered, O, madam, I have done it, and it cannot be help'd; or to that purpose. There was our foul cloaths-bag in the room by her, with a number of things in it that belong to Mrs. Carr. I said, where are all the things that you have taken? she said, they are here, in the bag. I went with her and the constable, and the bag, in the coach to Mr. Cox's, the things were examined there directly; there were several pieces of lace, a pair of laced ruffles, a cloak lined with beaver, a black bonnet, a white sattin cloak, two Dresden aprons, two pair of round robbins laced, a pair of stockings, these all belong to Mrs. Carr. (Produced in court.) I found also a striped lutestring gown, a cotton gown, a laced handkerchief, a pair of muslin ruffles, and four pieces of lace, my property. (Produced in court.) We not finding all the things that we missed, the Justice asked her what she had done with them; she said she gave them to Mrs. Ferne over night for her to take care of, and that the prisoner Ward had bought a riding-shirt of her for 4 s. and that Ward made her give her the 4 s. again, but never gave her back the shirt; there was no shirt found there.</p>

            ; he searched, but found nothing. They said Ward was not there, and that she was married, and they did not know her husband's name this was in my hearing: we did not meet with her, we returned again to the Justice. Thomas was brought up again, she then said there was a piece of lace, which she had sold to Mrs. Ferne<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180018"/> for half a guinea, but she had delivered the lace back again, and she had returned Mrs. Ferne her money. The constable can give an account of what he found at Leedham's; we got every thing again at last.</p>

            . I am servant to Mrs. Carr. I had a warrant granted to take up Thomas, I went to Ferne's house the day after the robbery, upon my enquiry of the landlord at the door, he told me there was no such person there as he knew of. I went in, and stood in the middle of the tap-room, and imagined I heard the girl's voice; I said to him, she is in that room, I wish you will go and see. He did not seem to move, I said, I'll go myself; then he pushed by me, and got into the room, and shut the door. In a little while the prisoner Ward came, she was servant there I believe, I asked her if

I forced forwards to go in, she pushed me from the door as much as she could, and said there was a woman in labour there. I imagined somebody withinside pressed at the door at the time. Mrs. Ferne came down stairs, I asked her if she had seen

She put down a tub she had in her hand, and went into the room; I went to go in, but she pushed the door too, and kept me out. I then called for a pint of beer, nobody brought it, I was almost certain she was in the room; I kept my eye upon the street door, and went for the constable, who was at a little distance; he came, I told him she was there, I had heard her voice; the constable went into the house with me, he went into the back yard to see if he could see her, then that room door was set open with four or five men in it. The constable then told me he had information she was at the Black Horse in the Hay-market. I went there, the man told me he knew no such person. I went back again through Germain-street, and saw Mr. Ferne on the other side of the street; I went to him, and said, are you sure this girl is not in your house, I am almost sure I heard her? he said, she was not there, and he did not know her if he met her. While I was talking to him Ward came out of the passage from the back door, and crossed over the kennel; I looked up the alley, and saw

             come out of the alley with a red cloak and black bonnet on. I said to Mr. Ferne, that is the girl; I jumped after her, and into the room where I heard her, and set down by her, and said the house-keeper was very angry with her for staying out all night. I wanted to send a messenger for the constable and Mrs. Gittoes, but the people of the house would not give liberty to the waiter, or any way assist me in it, they were at the Blackmoor's-head; with much ado I sent them word, they came, I saw the bag and two bundles of things with the prisoner. I told her I was sorry for her; she said I had no occasion to be sorry, it was nothing to me; and if my mistress was a considerate woman she would let her go, as there were all the things again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Rose, the constable, confirmed that of the securing the prisoner Thomas, and seeing the bag and two bundles with her, and finding the shirt at Leedham's.</p>

I said, I wanted Mr. Horn; he said, he was his head clerk; then I said, you may do as well, I want to receive some money on these writings, I am told there is 25 l. due: said he, there is 27 l. due, you may come twenty or thirty times after it and not get it, said he, I'll get it you this afternoon, but our hours are broke up now, and we are going to dinner, go to the Navy coffee house, and I'll come to you; he overtook me before I got there, sir, said he, I suppose you understand the nature of our office; I said, I am quite a stranger to it; said he, our see is a guinea; I said, rather than come twenty times I'll pay it; I gave him two half guineas, and let him have the writings, in order to have them signed, this was in the street. Then I went into the coffee-house, he came there to me again, and said, sir, I have quite forgot our under clerk, he will expect his see; said I, what is that? that, said he, is only 6 s. 8 d. I having but 6 s. gave him that, and said, I live at such a place, I'll give you a bottle of wine if you'll call upon me. Never mind the 8 d. said he, and away he goes again. I had a little suspicion of him, and said to the landlady, do you know Mr. Horn's clerk? said she, I know some of the clerks; said I, when that man comes in again if you know him let the word be yes, if not, say no. He came the third time and said, I beg your pardon, I cannot get it done to night, but I will in the morning. My landlady said, No. I said, let me know your name; he said,

He led me there, he said, this is our office; he went through, and said, if you'll stop here I'll call a gentleman out of this house that shall soon satisfy you. I seeing wrote over the place, no thoroughfare, and the porter pulled off his hat to him, and let him through, I staid a little while, and said to the porter, do you know that gentleman? he said, no; I said, let me through; he did, then I found myself on Tower-hill, but could see no more of my gentleman.

I observed, as she turned by the cardinal, it was mine; I took hold of her, and charged her with the robbery; she and her husband denied it; they said they would go and shew me where they bought the cloak; when we came near St. Giles's church, the man ran away as hard as he could; we brought his wife home to our house, then we went to Justice Fielding; she said her husband gave her the cardinal; after that the prisoner was taken up for much such another fact; I went to him in New Prison, there he told me one of my gowns was at Mr. Pain's in Bow-street, the other at Mr. Burch's in Fox-Court, but the last could not be found. I asked him how he got into the house? he said he got in at one o'clock, the devil put it into his head; and he lifted up the flap of the door, where the beer goes down, and got in, it was not very strong. it might easily be open'd with a chissel; when he was in the cellar he could easily get up into the house. (I found the till, in which the money was, on the floor.) He owned he took the things out of the house. (A gown and cardinal produced and deposed to.)</p>

            . I was the officer of the night. I had heard a thief's whistle, I went to look towards Tower-hill; coming back into the watch-house, I heard murder and thieves cried towards the Butcher-row, I made what haste I could that way, I saw there two or three men running as fast as possible, they had all got through the posts but one, I jump'd through, and whether I touch'd that man or not, down he fell, and I upon him, I brought him to the watch-house, that was Ryley; other people were pursuing, they soon brought in Dennison and the evidence. The prosecutor there declared, that Dennison and Ryley were the two persons that robbed him; he said, he was not sure whether Mates the evidence used him ill or not, but he was in company with the others. They had each a stick. I took out of Ryley's pocket this clasp-knife. (Producing a knife, the blade about seven inches long.) Before the Justice they all said, they did not know one another; at last they all owned, they came together from Stepney.</p>

I was coming from Islington to London on Wednesday the 13th of April, my wife was with me, I stopt at the Crown and Woolpack to speak to a young man that lived there, I had not been there above five or six minutes before I heard a woman cry, stop thief, I don't think it was a minute after before Wilkinson came by with this bundle under his arm, I immediately fo llowed and came up with him, just by the Woolpack brewhouse.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is that from the Woolpack?</p>
               <p>Townsend. That is about thirty or forty yards from it. I said, you are the man that has got the bundle; I was on the outside of the rails, and he in the path-way; he immediately put his right hand into his pocket, and made an offer at me over the rails, I dropt down by the side of the rails to save myself, thinking he had a knife or pistol in his hand; he made use of some expression, but I do not remember the words; I immediately followed him about a dozen or fourteen yards farther; he took the bundle from under his arm and threw it at my head quite cross the road, I took up the bundle, and was going after him again, I heard somebody say he was taken upon the causeway, I got up to the King of Prussia's head, and had not stood there above a minute before he was brought up by

            ; he had a black coat on, I knew him to be the same, as I had been close to him by the rails, and could see the bundle under his arm very plain; his hat was stop'd before over his face, I saw he had his own hair on, but could not take particular notice of his face; I could tell him by his speech, having a gruff voice when he spoke to me. (Such was the prisoner's voice.) I am sure he is the very same man that had the bundle, that is Wilkinson now at the bar. (The bundle produced in the court, with the things in it mentioned in the indictment; deposed to by the prosecutrix as the bundle she was then robbed of, her property.)</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutrix. How near the Woolpack was it you was robbed?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. It was on that side towards Islington.</p>
               <p>Townsend. She shewed me the place afterwards, it was about twenty yards from the Woolpack nearer Islington. When Wilkinson was brought up I immediately said, this is the man that had the bundle, and I will swear to him; I took him by the collar and had him to the Woolpack alehouse, I heard Esquire Cross was at the Angel, I took him there, he advised me to take him to Bridewell.</p>

            . I was at the Woolpack, Mr. Townsend and I were there talking together, I heard the cry, stop thief! three men came by walking as fast as they could towards London, I went up to one of the men and said, a woman cried out, stop thief; Geary being one of them cried out, yonder he goes, cross the fields; I said, you can't for them I am sure.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed?</p>
               <p>Roffe. He had a blue great-coat on, a hat and perriwig.</p>
               <p>Geary. You'll swear your soul to hell.</p>
               <p>Roffe. I touch'd him, and looked him in the face, and kept walking on by his side, he began to move his hands about, then I got a little farther off; the other two were a little before; when they got upon the causeway, Wilkinson made a push, I called out, this man is guilty by his running away; I followed him as far as the King of Prussia's head, till they began to make a run.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>
               <p>Roffe. It was not very dark. Wilkinson ran directly down the causeway from the King of Prussia, I ran about half way down the road, (he was foremost, the two went on one side, not down the causeway, but over the fields by the New River side) I was getting up the cause, way to Wilkinson, I said, do not go to strike me, for here is somebody coming, he was come close to the rails to strike me; I got up, and took him by the collar, and kept him four or five minutes till somebody came, then we brought him to the King of Prussia, they seeing a mob about the door would not let us in; we took him to the house where I live, the Crown and Wool-pack. there the woman was, and said that is the man that took my bundle, he had a black coat on, we set him down in the fore room in about a quarter of an hour two men came in and called for six pennyworth of brandy and water, Geary was one of them, I could have sworn to him then as one in company with Wilkinson; he asked what they had done with the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176305180028"/> man? he was told they had taken him to Bridewell, then they went about their business.</p>

               <p>Q. to the Prosecutrix. Did you say, upon seeing Wilkinson, that was the man that took your bundle?</p>
               <p>Prosecutrix. If I did say so I was so frightened I did not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Roffe. I asked Geary to go into the fore room, as I had told my mistress he was one of them, but he would not.</p>
               <p>Geary. You'll swear a man's life away for a bunch of matches. I did call for brandy and water, but I was fuddled.</p>

            . Wilkinson was brought into Clerkenwell Bridewell, and the next morning about 8 o'clock Geary came to drink with him; by the description I had, I suspected he was one of them, I was told one belonging to him was justly and had one black eye, I asked him how he came by that black eye? he said he was fuddled, and fell down on Tower-hill, and hurt it. I turned the key upon him, and carried him before Sir

The last time Wilkinson was examined by Sir John, he wanted to be evidence against Geary, and declared there that Geary was the man that knocked the woman down, and gave the bundle to him, and he put it under his coat, and when Townsend went to lay hold of him he threw it at him, but the Justice would not admit him.</p>
               <p>Geary. Justice Fielding would have admitted me an evidence, but I could not, except I would d - n my poor soul.</p>
