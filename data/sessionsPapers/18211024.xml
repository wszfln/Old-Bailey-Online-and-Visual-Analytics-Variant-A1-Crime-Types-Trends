On a Thursday, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner in the cellar when I came down - he came up to the ground floor, and then went up stairs, he had a little bundle under his arm, tied up in a handkerchief; I never saw him before. I said nothing to him, but went and told my mother that he was about the house all the morning, she was in the shop, which is over the way. My father was in the cellar, with Hall, getting up potatoes, he was not in the cellar when I saw the prisoner there, but when I went and called my mother. I came back to the house, went up stairs, and saw the prisoner in the front bed-room, on the first-floor, with the door a little open, I ran down and called Stop thief! he ran down after me. Hall ran up stairs, from the cellar, and caught him as he came down stairs, he was taken to the watch-house, by an officer, who was sent for. Scott searched him. He had gone out, and come in again, in the course of the morning.</p>

My master asked me who he was - I did not know him; about five or ten minutes after I heard Edward call out, I ran up and stopped the prisoner. I saw no bundle.

            . I am an officer. I went and took charge of him, at Tedd's, and took him to the watch-house. I searched him there, he said it was his first offence, and he hoped I would not collar him, and he would walk quietly with me, which he did. In his right hand breeches pocket, I found a bag with a half-sovereign, 15 s., and a small book, in it. I found a small medal on him, and in his coat pocket, I found a razor, two knives and two keys; he had a chisel in his hand. I took the chisel to the house, and applied it to the front bed-room door, there were marks on the door and door-post which it fitted, the lock was much shattered - the bolt appeared to have been forced back by the chisel; there were marks on a drawer in a chest in the room, which the chisel fitted. I did not examine the lock. A piece was broken out of the drawer.</p>

I went to the Duke of Clarence, public-house, and went home at a quarter before eleven o'clock; I put the key in the door, gave it one turn, and found it on the single<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240004"/>lock, but not doubly locked as I left it. I am quite sure I doubly locked it. I found the back door unbolted, and on the latch - I am sure I did not leave it so. I missed a timepiece off the mantle-shelf down stairs. I went up stairs, found four drawers quite empty, and pulled out - they had contained sheets, gowns, and other things, which were all gone.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. I had left home the night before this happened. I never saw the prisoner before. When I went away I left seven cotton gowns, two pair of sheets, two pair of cotton stockings, four shifts, and other things, all safe - the timepiece was worth 30 s. - I had had it about a year, my father gave it to me - it was an old watch which he had put into a pedestal. I should think all the property was worth 10 l. I lost twelve napkins, my husband's coat, a silver tea-spoon, and some petticoats and frocks.</p>

            . I am a constable. About a quarter before twelve o'clock last Thursday night, I and Wright, the patrol, met the prisoner and another man in the New-road, between a quarter and half a mile from the prosecutor's, coming from that way; after they had passed we observed the prisoner had a bundle under his coat, Wright ran and caught hold of him, the other ran off; I asked him what he find in his bundle, he said shirts and sheets that he had from his little brother at the corner of the square (he did not say what square), and he was going to take them to his mother, at Bermondsey - he was not in the road to Bermondsey. I took his hat off, and found a gown and child's frock in it. The other man was taller than the prisoner. He said he did not know the person whom we saw with him - that he was a stranger, and was not with him. I have no doubt of their being together; one of them was singing, and the other as close to him as possible - they nearly touched each other. We took him to the turnpike-gate, and examined the bundle. He had the coat on. I did not find the timepiece.</p>

            , she came out of a yard, into Wentworth-street, she had a bonnet on, she met me and appeared in a fright, and said, "For G - d sake, come and help me, there is a person in distress;" or words to that effect. I ran into the yard, she said, up stairs, and I followed her up stairs to the first floor. Norris ran up immediately as I got in, shut the door, and put her back against it, and said, she would have some money for the room - there was a bedstead in the room. She persisted in this for some minutes. I said, I would give her no money; she said, she would be **** but she would have it, I still refused, and at last I said, "What do you want?" she said, she would have 1 s. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240005"/>gave her that, and then she said, she would have another; I gave her another, and then she said, she would have four more; I pushed her on one side, rushed down stairs, and Norris called out "Lock the door." When I got down, five more women below seized me, and took some money from me, above 3 s., they tore my breeches pocket and all off, and beat me dreadfully. I kept my hand on my pocket as well as I could, and I got a sovereign from one of them which she had taken, I think I lost eight or ten shillings. They said they would have more money, I gave them some money when they were holding me below, and they said I had given them none, the door was fastened, and they said "Do not let him get to the window;" I cried Murder! for six or seven minutes, and there were about twelve fellows outside who shut the shutters, and left me in the dark, both the prisoners had ran down after me, and assisted in holding me, the door by some means came open, and I got out of the house without my hat, and found twelve or men standing outside, they did not attempt to stop me. I went to Lambeth-street police office immediately, three officers went with me to the place, and saw the two prisoners, and some more, but I was sure of these two - they beat me very much, and Norris said, "Murder him." I said I could swear to those two, for they were up stairs, and I had an opportunity of seeing them. When I went with the officers, there were four or five women there, and about a dozen men still outside; the prisoners were taken into custody. I was perfectly sober. This was between two and three o'clock in the afternoon - I had dined at my brother's in Great St. Helens, and was going to a hair-dresser's in Whitechapel. I had come to town on the Saturday before. I went up to the room, in consequence of the woman making an alarm, and for no improper purpose whatever. The money I gave for the room, was extorted from me through fear of being murdered, and nothing else</p>

            . I belong to Lambeth-street office. The prosecutor came to me on Tuesday the 9th of October, about a quarter past three o'clock, he had a hat on then; the Magistrate was just gone, he complained of being robbed - I went with him, and two officers, to Wheeler's-court, George-yard, part of it comes into Wentworth-street, it has three outlets, and is about a quarter of a mile from the office, he pointed out the house, we went in with him, and found five or six women, and I think one man, and five or six men were standing round the house, and some bricklayers at work - I went into the lower room and said, "Be particular, look round and see if you can point out any of these women," they were altogether, I made them stand up, he pointed out the prisoners from among the rest, and said they had robbed him, and told the same story he has now. They said he must be mistaken, for they should not remain in the house, if they had done it. He said, in their presence, at the office, "If you look at one of their hands, you will find I have bit one of their fingers." I examined one of Palmer's fingers, it appeared as if it had been hit or scratched.</p>

I came to town on Thursday, the 18th of September, in a waggon, went to Leadenhall-market, and sold some ducks and fowls, and took about 4 l. there; I had other money about me. When I left the market I had about 20 l. in two purses; one contained eight sovereigns and eight 1 l. country bank notes, and in the other was upwards of 4 l. in silver, that was in my right hand pocket, and the other in my left. I left the market between eight and nine o'clock, and went to Billingsgate, and from there to the Catherine Wheel, Bishopsgate-street, and had a bason of tea and a glass of rum in it. I had had half a pint of beer at five of o'clock. I was then going to Whitechapel; I went up Brick-lane, missed the turning, and got into <placeName id="t18211024-5-crimeloc31">George-street</placeName>

I gave Davis 1 s. and she sent this woman to fetch the liquor; she went out for it, and returned with two other women - there was then four women there, when they came I wanted to go, but they insisted on having 1 s., for the room, and bolted me in, I took out my purse of silver, and threw down 1 s., on the floor - Davis tried to snatch it out of my hand, but I got the better of her, and put it into my left hand pocket, at the top of the other purse - they all four surrounded me, and held my back against the table, so that I could not stir, they held my arms, and bent my back over the table, and took my purse away, one of them said, "Have you got it?" another answered in a vulgar manner, that she had got it, and said let him go. I ran out of doors without my hat, they went up stairs, and threw my hat out of window to me, and I got it again.</p>
               <p>Q. You say the women held your back, were you struck by any of them - A. Yes, I was beat very sorely about my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240006"/>forehead by Steel. I am sure she is the woman, while they held me over the table Steel came in, and I think another woman, there was then six of them, she struck me at the time they were getting my purse away, she came in before the question "Have you got it" was asked. When I got out of the house, some people came by, I said I would give them 5 s., to fetch an officer, and I would keep the door the while, I could get no one to go, a boy wanted the money first - I went up the street, and applied to an officer who was not at home - I was sent to Westley who came, we found Steel at the corner of the street, where I had been robbed, she was taken, and told the officer of two more. Davis was taken a fortnight after. My purse contained above 3 l. 10 s.; I went into the house between eleven and twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Prisoner DAVIS. Q. Can you look me in the face, and swear I am the woman who picked you up - A. On my oath, she took me to the house. I would say so on my dying bed.</p>

            . I am an officer. The prosecutor came to me, and complained of being robbed; he appeared perfectly sober; his head was very much bruised on the temple, and the cheek bone, the skin was broken, and it bled. I went with him to find the house, he did not know how to find the place again, we met Steel at the corner of Wentworth-street, he said he was robbed just by there, and pointed to Wentworth-street; we went there, and saw Steel standing at the corner of the street. I told him to be cautious in fixing on any of them, without being sure - I stood at the door of the Two Brewers, public-house, he ran over to her, seized her, and charged her with being the person, I took her - he described Davis to me. I mentioned it to another officer. She was taken a week afterwards. I found nothing on Steel.</p>

As I brought her along, she said, she was innocent - she then said, the keys were those of her boxes, which were at her aunt's, but that her aunt knew nothing of what she had taken there.

The prisoner was about seven weeks in my service - about the 10th of August before she left, I took 10 l. in copper up stairs, in a bag, and put it in my bed-room cupboard, which was not locked. About four or five days after she left, I was going to pay my brewer, and missed 4 l. out of the bag, I had missed copper and silver before, at different times, but not out of the bag, I have missed one shilling or two at once out of a bowl in my bar, My wife used to make up the copper, in 5 s. papers. I also missed a glass cloth, stockings, and handkerchiefs - we kept the door locked, only she and my wife had access to the room.</p>

I and my daughter slept together. About half-past two o'clock in the morning, I heard the stairs creak, and footsteps going up and down. I went to sleep again, supposing it to be my lodger; I got up, about half-past six o'clock, and when I came down to the first-floor front room, I found the door open, and the back room door also, my bureau was open, and all the drawers pulled out, I went and told my daughter, and then searched, and missed the articles mentioned in the indictment - some of the linen was my daughter's, the books and plate were mine, and a silver watch, was mine, the other, which was gold, is my daughter's; one umbrella, was my lodger's, the other mine, it had an embossed border, the shoes, sheets, scarf, silk-handkerchief, one bombazeen, and a coloured dress, were mine; the other dress, and two handkerchiefs, were my daughter's, and the rest, my lodger's. The books were the History of England, Josephus, and a large family Bible. About seven o'clock that morning the watch-house keeper called; I went to the watch-house between eleven and twelve, and saw part of my property.

            . I am a watchman; my beat is in Euston-street, Euston-square. On Sunday morning, the 16th of September, just before three o'clock, I heard footsteps of several men - I was on my beat, walking about and saw several men - I followed them about a quarter of a mile, across a brick-field - four or five of them had bundles, which made me suspect them. I overtook Nott, and asked him to assist me - they saw us pursuing them, and mended their pace, and went down Euston-street, towards Tottenham-court-road, crossed the New-road into Upper Thornaugh-street, and were turning down Carmarthen-street; as they turned the corner I secured Hayward - he had a bundle under his arm, wrapped up in a grey cloak; when I seized him, he dropped it, Nott picked it up, and I took him to the watch-house. While I was securing him his hat fell off, in his struggling to get away - he did not make a forcible resistance, only struggled; his hat fell off, another watchman picked it up, and brought it to the watch-house, and I saw a pink dress taken out of it. He was searched in my presence, at the watch-house, and I saw a pair of silver sugar-tongs, a glass salt, silk and a white handkerchief, a pair of silk stockings, and two latch keys taken out of his pockets. I saw Nott pick up a grey cloak bundle, which the prisoner dropped.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He said he would go quietly with you, and did - A. He wished me to loose him after he had struggled to get away. I kept all the men in view till he was taken. I am positive he was in their company.</p>

I spent three afternoons with him, and have frequented his house - I have also met him at Maynard's, in Spring-gardens. In consequence of his kindness to me, he mentioned the obligation I was under to him, and said I might do him a kindness in assisting him to move away some goods. We proceeded to the house of Mr. Connelly, the Yorkshire Grey, near Fetter-lane (this was on Friday evening), to meet some others of his acquaintances; they did not come, but on the following evening, Saturday, we went there precisely at half-past nine o'clock, and met four people there besides ourselves; we stopped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240008"/>about half an hour, and then proceeded to Charlton-street, Somer's Town, they left me at the corner of a public-house for five or ten minutes - Charles-street turns out on the left of Charlton-street - they left me by myself, the rest went somewhere, and returned in about ten minutes, we passed Stebbings's house and crossed a brick-field behind the premises, to a public-house in Euston-street, which is a quarter of a mile off; we staid there till past twelve o'clock,, and then came from there to the field at the back of Stebbings's premises, we staid there for a quarter of an hour, and two of the men who met us at the Yorkshire Grey, took a bundle which they had with them towards the house - one of the men wore a glazed hat. I saw the window broken open by a man named Bill, the one who wore the glazed hat was beneath him; Hayward was with me, about ten yards off, the other men were near us, at the back part of the premises. Bill got in at the window, and let the man with the glazed hat in at the back door - they were in the house about an hour, or an hour and a half. A man was stationed at the door, he took the things, and brought them out, and among the rest there was a book - he kept bringing out things to us - we were at the back of the premises - and one or another disposed of them under our clothes. When they came out something was forgotten, and Hayward said something that was of more consequence, was left behind. Bill and Hayward went into the house, and one of them brought a small bundle out. The property was taken to my lodgings in the New-road, Pancras. Some of the linen was put into an outer cellar there, only two men came there, and they brought the bundle of linen, and an umbrella, nothing else; nothing was said about bringing any more to my house. The other men were waiting a little way off. I went with them part of the way towards town - The bundle of linen was large and heavy, and they were tired of carrying it. The umbrella had an embroidered edge, it was separate from the bundle. We all came away together from my lodging, and turned down the road towards Somer's Town, went up a street without a name, and then through a street leading into Carmarthen-square - the watchman followed us, we went up some other streets, and were dispersed by the watchmen. I went away alone, home to my lodging. I did not see Hayward taken. When I got to my lodging I found Bill, who broke into the house, and a man, who looked like a coachman, that went down into the cellar for the bundle - I was desirous of its being taken away. They said they intended to take it away, and that we should go to Charles-street to get a cross rattler (a coach to take away stolen goods). We went down Tottenham-court-road, Bill shewed me some tea which he had hid. We made our nearest way to Charles-street, Covent-garden, I staid while Bill and the coachman-like looking man went and had some coffee. A man, with his face lacerated, came up and assisted in moving some of the property; Bill went and spoke to the coachman, who was the prisoner, Judd; he called him Bill, and appeared acquainted with him. They went to my lodging with the coach. I was inside the coach. Bill, the coachman-like looking man, the man with the cut face, and another, all rode on the box, and the rest inside. Upon getting to my lodging the bundle and umbrella were taken out, and put into the coach - Judd kept on his box. While they were being put in I saw through the handkerchief that there was linen in the bundle - and an handkerchief and table-cloth fell out they were put back into the bundle. We proceeded, through various turnings, to pass away the time, a roundabout way to Gray's Inn-lane, the end near Holborn; we got there about four o'clock, I should think. We waited in the coach at a court called Fox-court; some conversation passed about trying to avoid the watchmen, Judd heard it, he stood at the door at the time - I do not know that he joined in the conversation. We waited there about a quarter of an hour, people came up and down the court, and the things were taken at different times to the lodging of the man with the cut face, who kept a glass and some gin in his hand, and when any one came by he kept talking about ill-usage, and being left by his companions. They could not get the property out, and proceded down Holborn; Judd proposed to stay on the stand with the property in the coach till seven o'clock, and said he could then dispose of it in Oxford-street; he stood on the stand with the coach, and we all waited at a public-house in view of the coach. My companions wanted to get away from me in the interim, and kept trying to lose me in the street, by going round the stalls in Fleet-market - we did not remain at the public-house all the time; I followed them. When they found I was determined not to lose sight of them, Bill said</p>
               <p>"We had better go to the crib at once." We went, they turned the coach round, and it was driven by Southampton-buildings, into Chancery-lane. They all got into the coach, except me - I walked; Judd drove. When they found I was following them they turned a contrary way, and said "We will meet you at seven o'clock this morning, under the Piazza, Covent-garden; "I agreed to that, and went away. I went to the Piazza, but they did not come. I was apprehended at three o'clock that afternoon, and told the watch-house keeper of this.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long is it since you have worked at your trade - A. It was three weeks previous to this. I knew Hayward for a fortnight before the robbery. I did not understand this to be a robbery, till I saw the men at work at the window - I then began to suspect something.</p>
               <p>Q. You were determined to have your share - A. I was anxious to get away, but was glad to accompany them to pass away the time. I asked what a cross rattler meant, and they told me, and there was a deal of conversation going on at the house we set out from, and there I learnt what a crib meant. I did not know before - I intended to serve Haywood. I meant to return to honest employ, next day, if I could get it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. You intended first to share in the booty - A. Yes; I was not aware what they took me to the house for. I partly suspected before I saw the window broken open, but such was my opinion of Haywood, for his gentleman-like conduct.</p>

I got a cart, they got in, and drove to Bread-street, got down at the end of the street, and told me to drive up to the door, they brought the bale out of the warehouse, put it in the cart, and told me to drive on.</p>

On the 27th of September, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was very near the Tabernacle, and opposite a pawnbroker's-shop there is a small alley, seven or eight young men were by the shop; I was walking briskly, and just as I came up to the corner I observed three who were taller then the rest, the others appeared boys; they stood between the posts, two rushed on me, and in a moment my watch was gone - I saw them coming up, but did not suspect them, they were both close to me - I halloo'd Stop thief! and an officer took the prisoner down the alley, they all ran down there - the prisoner was brought into the pawnbroker's-shop to me, in about ten minutes - I knew him by his waistcoat, which appeared light, he was the nearest to me. I never found my property - I conceive him to be the boy who took it, by his waistcoat, but I am sure he was one of them.</p>

About the 6th of September in the morning, I missed a 5 l., note, and afterwards missed a gold neck-chain ten feet and four inches long, two gold ear-rings, two pair of white silk stockings, a silver vinegaret, marked E. A. B. a sovereign, a diamond ring, two common gold rings, and some small gold buttons - I went to Bow-street, Nicholls the officer, and I went to the prisoner's father the next morning, and found some brandy and gin, we searched every part of his house, but found nothing else; I said, he had better confess, and in consequence of what he said, I went to a pawnbroker's in Crawford-street, and found one of the ear-rings; I then went to Rundell and Bridge's, and in consequence of what I heard there, I went to Furber's, in Jewin-street. The prisoner's father came to my house, and gave me 3 l. 17 s., or 18 s., in a purse, in which were three of the gold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240012"/>buttons, and said, in the prisoner's presence, that he found them in a hole, under the floor, and it was with great difficulty he could reach them, they were put down so far - I saw some more of the gold buttons, (I think six) found on a boy. The vinegaret was brought to my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. AIKEN. Q. After his father brought you the things, what did you say to the prisoner - A. I said if he would tell me what he had done with the property, I would not prosecute him. I did not care whether it was recovered or not, as I supposed it to be his first offence. I never told him to go down on his knees, and beg my pardon - I allowed him to go home to his father's after the constable had been to my house, I had not given him in charge; if he had accounted for the property I should not have proceeded.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not agree that if the father made up the difference, you would allow him a little time - A. No; the father asked me, I refused. The prisoner said one Benjamin was concerned in it, but he denied it.</p>

I find an entry in my books (looking at it), that on the 1st of September, I bought thirteen penny weights, sixteen grains of gold, for 37 s. 6 d., of a person named Hill, I believe it was part of a twisted gold chain, he brought a card to me, it was a young man, but I cannot speak to his person - I was applied to about a week afterwards, it was then melted. I gave him quite the full value - I I bought one ounce and a half penny weight of silver, of him also, for 4 s. 11 d., I think that was part of a spoon, he had a basket with him - I thought he came from some jeweller.</p>

            . I am a salesman, and live in Crawford-street. I deal in wearing apparel - I am not acquainted with the prisoner, but know his person; he brought me a gold chain on the 27th of August, about a yard long, and wanted to sell it to me, he said, he found it, I said I could buy nothing of the kind, of a little boy like him - it was a gold twisted wire chain; he had bought a pair of breeches of me a week before, and that was the way I knew him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long had you known him - A. He came to me on the 19th of August, I had seen him pass my door very often before, but had not spoken to him till he came about the breeches; he gave me 6 s. for them; he took them home to his father's. I did not buy the chain of him, I only dealt once with him, and that was for the breeches - I never bought any thing of him; I make it a rule never to buy of boys. I never spoke to him till he bought the breeches. I am not under recognizance to answer any charge. I have no doubt of his being the boy.</p>
               <p>G. HOWELL re-examined. I saw the vinegaret on the 27th of August, it was brought, I think, on the 8th of August; it was pawned once, taken out, and pawned again - the prisoner's brother brought it one of the times; I do not know which, it was the same brother that brought the ear ring.</p>

            . I work at a muffin baker's, and live in Homer-street, with my father, who is a porter. I knew the prisoner for about a fortnight before this took place; my first acquaintance was by meeting him in Crawford-street. He asked me if I would go with him, I went with him to Park-street (his father lived in a court opposite our house); I met him again in Crawford-street, two or three days after, and he gave me a pair of white silk stockings - I sold them to a Jew, in the street, for 2 s. 6 d. Before this I took them to Neat's, the pawnbroker's, in Duke-street, to pawn, but he would not take them in - he told me to send my mother; I had told him my mother sent me. I met him again three or four days after, standing by Mr. Jenkins's, the pawnbroker's shop, in Crawford-street. There was something in the window like a star - it was like the ear-ring produced. I said it was a funny thing - he said he had sold it. I did not ask him where he got it till just as he was going away and then he would not tell me. He had a gold chain in his hand on that day, and shewed it to me, it was a twisted chain (Mr. Bennett here produced part of the chain, which was taken off before it was stolen), it was just like this, he had it rolled up in his hand, I could not tell the length, he said, he had given half of it to his father, because his brother told his father, that he had it, and his father was going to beat him, and he gave him half of it not to beat him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How came you to tell Neat a different story about the stockings, to what you say to day - A. I said I had them from my mother, which was not true. I swear I had them from the prisoner - the chain was never in my hand, I was not long looking at it, he stood close to me, I saw the piece which was produced, at the office, four or five weeks after I saw the prisoner with the chain; he told me it was a twisted chain. I called it a twisted chain at the office.</p>
               <p>MR. FURBER. I think the chain resembled this, and from the price I gave for it, it must have been of this quality. I bought it as a single chain; ten feet and a half of it would be worth much more than 37 s. I did not buy above two feet.</p>

On the 17th of October I was sitting at work on the second floor, and heard the latch of my mother's parlour door lifted up. I listened, and heard it a second time, and a noise like a door being burst open. I immediately went down stairs, and found the street door open, which I had latched about half an hour before, and on turning round I found the parlour door open; I shut the street door, and pushed the parlour door quite open, it was a-jar; I found the prisoner at the top drawer of the bureau, with his hand in it; he turned round, and put on his hat. I asked what he wanted - he made no answer, but attempted to push me away, to get out; I held him by the arm, and called Faulkner, the lodger, who detained him till I went for my mother, who was out; on coming home she examined her drawers, in the prisoner's presence, and missed a shawl from the top drawer - he immediately said it was not out of the house; Faulkner asked him where it was - he pulled off his hat, and tried to throw the shawl out, Faulkner told him to keep it in till the officer came, and when he came he took it out of his hat.</p>

On the 23d of October, I went with Mitchell into the City, and at five o'clock we were going to Drury-lane Theatre, we went to a house (I do not know the name of the place;) when we got inside, the prisoner Sullivan said to Mitchell "I know you," and asked him up stairs - he went up with her, and I went up with Turner; we two were in a room by ourselves - she demanded 4 s., which I gave her; she then asked for another shilling, and I gave it her - about that time Sullivan came into the room, and said she wanted 1 s., and if I did not give it her, she would knock my brains out, and tear my coat off my back - I gave her 1 s.; Turner then demanded another shilling, which I gave her - Simmons then came into the room, saying she was mistress of the house, and asked for 2 s. 6 d. for the room, I said "If you will let me come down stairs to the street door, I will give you what money I have about me" - Then Sullivan and Turner demanded 2 s. 6 d. each, more; I said, "Let me go down, and I will give you all I have" - they would not agree to this, and the two women knocked me down - Simmons was present then; one of the two women laid hold of my neck, by thrusting her fingers into my cravat - I called out Murder! to my friend, he did not come - I heard one of the three say, they would throw me out of the window; one of them put a chair against the door, I asked them to let me go down stairs. In consequence of their violence I gave 14 s. 6 d. to Turner and Sullivan, and they let me go down stairs - Simmons then opened the door and let me out - I do not think she had any of the 14 s. 6 d.; when I got down, I found my friend alone.</p>

            , in Han's-place, and with his father - I left about a month ago, as I was ill; I have got a place now, and am going to the East Indies - I had dined in the City, and I think we had two pints of beer and a glass of rum each at dinner; then we went a little way and had a pint of beer between us - we went to no other public-house, nor had any thing more to drink; I think I was a little in liquor, as I am not accustomed to drink much - I sent my friend to this house to enquire for a young woman whom I knew in France, I had seen her at this house two years before - I did not know what kind of a house it was; I stood at the door, and the girls said the young woman did live there, and they made us go up stairs - she was not a bad girl; Turner said, "Come up stairs, and you will see her," and I went up - I did not promise her any money; I was a quarter of an hour in the room altogether - nothing passed between us, I did not call Sullivan up.</p>
               <p>Q. Simmons did not attempt to keep you in the room - A. She let me out when I gave the 2 s. 6 d. and the 14 s. 6 d. - she did not put the chair before the door; I did not want to go for an officer, for fear of my character, but my friend took me to Bow-street - I never sent any message to them that I would go to Gravesend, some people came to me.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you swear you never had any criminal connexion with them - A. I had not.</p>

            . I am a planter, and lodge with the prosecutor. I went with him to Drury-lane, intending to go to the Theatre; we had dined together in the City, we had two pints of porter between us, and a glass of rum and water - we were going to the Theatre, it wanted a quarter to five o'clock when we got to Drury-lane, we sauntered about and went to several courts; he pointed out a house in Swan-yard, and said, "I knew a young woman, named Mary Ann, who lived there, I wish you<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240014"/>would ask if she is there now, as I am a foreigner," he said he knew her as a lady's maid; I went to the door, which was open, I knocked with my hand against it, and four or five women came up from below; I asked for Mary Ann, they said she did not live there; one of the women said she knew me, I said that was strange, for I had not been in England for eight years; Baytiste stood by the stairs, one of them caught hold of him and went up stairs with him; I went up stairs to follow him, but when I got up, I saw no more of him - I went up to the second story with Sullivan, I said, I thought my friend was there; I had no money, and did not wish to go with her; she said I had better go down stairs and wait till he came, I did so, and sat down in the room on the ground floor; I heard him call me before he came down, he said, "Charles! Charles!" three times; I did not hear a cry of Murder! - when he came down he said he had been robbed; the women were present; there was a good deal of talking, I could not hear what was said; he said he would not leave till he had got his money. I told him he would never get it by waiting there, and went with him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. AIKIN. Q. What planter are you - A. Of sugar canes. I told Sullivan I had no money, she said my friend would pay her, I said, I knew nothing of that - Baptiste called out to me while I was down stairs, nothing passed about his having no money - I do not know what became of Sullivan, I was down in the parlour, he did not call her up; I heard feet shuffling about - it is a small house, I think if he had called Murder! lustily, I should have heard him; when he came down, he said he had been robbed of 2 l., but on coming out, he found he had a sovereign and two or three shillings left; then he reckoned his money, and said he had given them 13 s. 6 d. in silver, and 13 d. in copper; he said he was robbed, and had given them money, that one demanded 2 s. 6 d., another 3 s. and 1 s. and another 4 s.</p>
               <p>Q. When he called out Charles! if you thought he wanted assistance, you would have gone to him - A. I did endeavour, but Kelly was in the parlour, and said, If I tried to go out, she would tear my liver out - I got hold of the door to open it, she prevented me, and said she was in the family way, and would swear her life against me - I said, I was not going to fight with her, and sat down; I was detained in the parlour about five minutes, Baptiste came down soon after he cried for me.</p>
               <p>BENJAMIN MORRIS. I am a constable of Bow-street. The prosecutor came to me, I took him to Swan-yard, and found them all (the prisoners) at the house; the last witness pointed out Kelly, and the prosecutor the other three; he said, in their presence, that they had robbed and beat him up stairs.</p>
               <p>TURNER'S Defence. Two gentlemen came and asked for Mary Ann, we said she was not there; he said, "You will do the same, let us go up, we went up," he wanted us to do wrong, but we refused.</p>
               <p>SULLIVAN'S Defence. We were down at dinner, Mitchell asked if I knew him, he said, "Come up stairs," and offered me 2 s., I said that was too little, he said his friend would pay me; he did as he liked, I went down and he gave me 1 s.; I saw no more of him.</p>
               <p>KELLY'S Defence. The gentleman came into the parlour, and being a stranger, I was in care of the parlour; he would pay nobody but the landlady for the room, she went up for it, I remained in the parlour, the man went towards the door, and I said he should not go till his friend came down, if he did, I would tear his coat, he pushed me, I said, "Don't, for I am in the family way."</p>
               <p>SIMMONS'S Defence. He sent word that he would pay nobody but me, and I went up.</p>

On Sunday evening, I saw her in Tothill-street, and took her - the constable was with me; I asked why she left her home, she said, through her husband's ill usage - I said that was not the case, but that she left on account of my business, the constable took her to the watch-house; he wished to search her, she gave up some duplicates, one was for a salt spoon, she said, if I would forgive her, she would tell me where they all were - I said, I did not wish to hurt her, if she would make the property good - she directed me to the different pawnbrokers.</p>

I saw Kernot crossing from the Compter, I found the prisoners there, he charged them with robbing him of four sovereigns, and some silver, Gordon said she had dropped a sovereign, I found one by the fire-place, about two yards from where she stood, I found 9 s. 6 d. on her, and 11 s. on Williams; a 10 l. country note was found in Williams's glove.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know there was a sovereign on the floor - A. She said she dropped one, Williams contradicted her, and said "You have not." Both denied it. Kernot did not appear quite sober, but knew what he was about well enough.</p>

Harris was sitting down at the table; the prisoner struck me and Harris struck him, and then the prisoner struck him a violent blow on his breast, just under his heart. The prisoner was dressed as a sailor. Harris fell from the blow, and was picked up by two men who were there. I had a pint pot in my hand with some beer in it, and I struck the prisoner on the head with the pot. Harris and I then went into the bar - the prisoner went out and came in again in a short time. I was sitting down in the bar and he hit me again, and then pushed Harris against the table in the bar. I do not know whether he struck him. The landlord came forward, took him by the shoulder, and made him go out. Harris was in liquor, but was sober enough afterwards. I had lived with Harris above seven years and a half, his health was always very good; he was taken to the hospital two days after. He worked the day after it happened, and next day I took him to the hospital, as he complained that he could not hold himself up to work; he was a shoemaker, and about fifty years old; he died at the workhouse at a quarter past twelve o'clock last Sunday night.</p>

            . I am landlord of the house. I was not present till Harris and the woman came into the bar. Harris's waistcoat was torn, and he had a scratch on his face, he did not appear much in liquor; the woman was a good deal in liquor. When I first saw Hurley he did not appear to have received any injury, except a cut with the pot over the head. I desired him to leave the house; he said was he to stand there and have his brains beat out, without taking his own part. I said I knew nothing about that, and told him to leave, he went to the door and stood with it in his hand a few minutes, and the woman began to abuse him; he said if she went on he would come and give her a slap - she did keep on, and he turned back and struck her and Harris also, and knocked his hat off; he was sitting behind the table, he was not knocked against the table. I then turned the prisoner out, and he went away.</p>

I was not in the tap-room at the first beginning; when I went in Hurley and the woman were quarrelling, she was abusing him - he went across to her and gave her a slight slap on the face - this was in the tap-room - Immediately afterwards the deceased struck the prisoner, and in the meantime the woman threw a pint pot at the prisoner's head, and cut his head open; she said she would go and fetch somebody to take the prisoner away - he struck the deceased one or two blows after the woman threw the pot. I did not see Harris. I saw no more; the woman and the deceased went out.</p>

            . I went in the tap-room with Cormack, he went out before the affair began, and returned again; the woman was singing a song - the prisoner did not approve of it, and said she had been jeering all the evening long - he got up from his seat and told her she had better be quiet - she would not, but used abusive words; he then gave her a slap with his hand - Harris got up and struck him - they had a scuffle together, and the woman threw a pint pot at the prisoner's head. The deceased did not appear to be hurt.</p>

            , ESQ. I am a surgeon. I saw Harris on Saturday last, at the workhouse, he was very ill then, he had been bled at the hospital, and every thing necessary was done. I saw him again on Sunday, between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, he then appeared to be dying, he died that day between one and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240019"/>two o'clock. Next day I examined his body. I opened it, and found the last two ribs on the left side fractured; the spleen was in a very diseased and altered state. I saw no external marks of violence. On searching I could not discover any thing that leads me to say the fracture was the cause of his death. I am unable to decide what caused it. The rib was broken in the projecting or convex part, but in such a way that it projected externally, the inner part was comparatively smooth, and had not injured the lungs. It being broken outside, proves that the force must have been applied to the point of the ribs, immediately over where the spleen lay. Such a state of spleen is often found without any injury - the appearance of the spleen was that which would arise from cronic diseases, rather than from a blow recently received.</p>

At five o'clock on Wednesday morning last, I was getting up, it was dark, if the morning had been fine there would have been a little light, so that I could have seen a person in the street, and have known him. I had no candle - I heard a terrible wrenching at the door or shop window, I looked over the curtain and saw a person with a white apron on, apparently wrenching the door open. Some men were going past, he went away, and came again five or six times. Every time he came I still saw him at work and heard the wrenching. I called up Mitchell - we both dressed, went down to the private door, and opened it softly, and found the shop door open. I called "Come out!" repeatedly, and at last I heard somebody move - I again said "Come out!" the prisoner came out - I collared him, gave him to Mitchell, and fetched a watchman. We found a crow-bar in the shop - I examined the door, found it had been wrenched open, and very much splintered.</p>

I saw him talking to a man - I went over and asked if he knew him, he said No; and then the prisoner ran through the house and down a court at the back; I ran, caught him, and said "If you leave me, I will kill you, I think you have stolen it" - I secured him.</p>

The prisoner, Wilkinson, delivered them to me out of a boat; he managed the boat, nobody else was in it - he said they contained guinea grain, which is a grain smaller than pepper, of a triangular form - the boat had "Marsh and Co." painted on it; the casks remained on board until the 10th of October, Warmby and I had charge of them; they were never opened while under my care - I went ashore two or three times a-day, and have remained ashore four hours, but was never ashore at night. On the 10th of October, Mr. Albert came on board and enquired for the chests; I knew him to be a searcher of the Customs. They had been stowed away the day before; he ordered me to assist in unheading them, I did so, and found ashes, cinders, and things of no value in them; it was not guinea grain.</p>

I remember Wilkinson bringing the chests; I and the last witness were never absent from the ship together - the chests were never opened while under my charge; I was present when Albert saw them, they contained rubbish - when Wilkinson brought them, Dorney asked him for a searcher's note, he said it was unnecessary, for it was guinea grain - a searcher's note ought to come with all packages; it contains the number and marks of the goods, and the searcher's name - we were satisfied with his answer, and took it in.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. Was the vessel going to sail - A. Yes; for Amsterdam, the crew were on board, it consisted of the captain, his wife, and brother, who was steersman, the cook, and two children - I slept in the hold where the casks were, when one of us was in bed, the other was on deck; it was the first time I was on board for the Customs, and I was strange to the business.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I searched the prisoners' house in consequence of a warrant; the male prisoner was in custody at the time, but I did not know it. I searched the house three times. The first time I searched nobody was there; I found various articles there the first time, part of which I produce. I have a list of the articles which I brought away. Here are (producing them) five shirts, two silk handkerchiefs, four silver spoons - three tea and one salt spoon - five pillow-cases, five pair of silk stockings, and I found a pair of new silk stockings rolled up in a paper, directed to Mr. Rothschild; and four muslim handkerchiefs, that is all I found on the first search, which was on the 29th of August; the house was shut up then, there are only two rooms, part was found in a trunk in the upper room, and part concealed under the bed; there was three or four bolsters, and six or seven pillows. On removing the bed-clothes there were parcels of property. I saw Barrett at Mr. Bevill's door on the 29th of August, and said, in his hearing that I had found a great quantity of fine linen in his house, which could not, I thought, belong to a man of his description; he pulled out his shirt and said "I always wear fine linen." I went again to the house on the 30th, and found his wife there, Lappan went with me; we went up stairs and she was in the room. Lappan was there before me and let me in. I made further search about the bed; and found eight cut glass rummers. I found in the bed twenty-two towels and napkins, three sheets, five night-caps, two table-cloths, three cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, six muslin neck-handkerchiefs, five pair of silk stockings, and one pair new, in a paper. I am not able to say what was found the first time. The shirts, handkerchiefs, and sheets were found the first day I know, and on the second day I found the napkins and towels. When I came to one particular towel, she said, "That's my own." She then said, "I will give you anything to desist from making further search." I afterwards found four white Marseilles waistcoats, two shifts, three pillowcases, two pin-cloths, a childs's shirt, four volumes of Classic Tales, one with Mr. Rothschild's name in it, and a lady's tortoiseshell writing-desk. Barrett claimed a pair of breeches, gaiters, watch, spoons, and other things which I found at the house, and he wished the key of the house to be given to his daughter. I found a child's coral head there the first time, and some knives and forks.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CURWOOD. Q. On the 29th you told Barrett you had found shirts finer than he could have - A. Yes, and the next day I found his wife at the house, she was at large.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When did you find the knives and forks - A. I found twenty-seven knives and forks, on the second day. I made a third search on the 31st, and found twenty-seven China plates, thirteen China saucers, forty-four blue and white plates, and four jugs; the plates were packed in five or six different hampers with hay, and full of glass and China.</p>

            . I am one of the horse patrol of Bow-street. I was with Joss at the second search, I got there before him, and found Mrs. Barrett there - Joss came in a quarter of an hour after, I told Mrs. Barrett, I was come to search the house again; I had been present at the first search; at the second search a variety of articles were found. When we were turning the napkins over, she said one was her own, and on searching further she said, "Pray do not search any more, and I will give you something for yourselves," I was present at the third search, and I made a fourth search on the Saturday, and only found a few small things; some clothes were found, which Barrett claimed, also the keys of the house.</p>

On Wednesday, the 8th of August, he spent the evening with us, and at half-past one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240022"/>o'clock in the morning left me in one of the rooms, where I had been sitting, and wished me good night to go to bed, I did not see him again at daylight, Mrs. Barrett, was generally the first person up in the family.

On the 4th of October I saw Wilkinson, he said a Mr. Cooper would be with me and give me some particulars to enter thirty bales of nux vomica, containing 750 bags. Mr. Cooper brought me certain warrants, and desired me to enter thirty bales of nux vomica by the first vessel to Amsterdam. We entered them at the Custom-house for the York Merchant vessel, laying in the London Docks; we entered them in the usual way, and gave the cocket, bill, and warrants over to Mr. Cooper. When all was done at the Custom-house I gave Wilkinson charge of my lug-boat and tarpaulings, with directions to take in the nux vomica at Bow-creek, which is by the East India Docks, on the Middlesex side of the River; he was to put them on board the York Merchant, then laying in the London Docks, which are five or six miles from Bow-creek. I do not know what occurred afterwards.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODRICK. Q. The warrants and cockets were delivered to Cooper to pay the charges - A. Yes. He represented himself as the owner. I was bondsman for the goods, that they should go to Amsterdam. I considered them in my charge, and expected to receive a lighterage on them; Wilkinson was employed by me, I expected to have to pay him. I had employed him several times before, but not constantly, he introduced Cooper to me as a merchant. Cooper entered into a bond as the exporter. It was put on board my boat from the East India Company's warehouse, Bow-creek, and therefore under my care - I gave Wilkinson charge of my boat and tarpauling, as my servant - it was cleared at the Custom-house in my name, as lighterman, and my name was on the boat. I gave Cooper in charge of an officer for a fraud, in conspiring to cheat the Government. I never saw it in any boat myself.</p>

On the 4th of October, I received an order to pack 750 bags of nux vomica in three different lots, and deliver it out of the warehouse for G. Cooper. I was to make thirty bales of the 750 bags. I proceeded to pack it in thirty bales on the 4th of October, it was done under my inspection. I packed it in coarse baggage, twenty-five bags in each bale, and on the 6th of October Wilkinson brought the warrant to me to deliver them. I delivered them into the hands of G. Smith, the wharfinger, to carry to Wilkinson's boat. Each bag weighed from 14 to 18 lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Cooper there - A. I rather think he came to me about them on the 3d, I delivered them on the 6th. I gave the wharfinger the warrants with them, and saw no more of them.</p>
               <p>MR. MARSH. The duties were not paid on them, they were to be exported free of duty; if they are consumed at home there is a duty of 2 s. 6 d. a pound - the article itself is not worth above 1 d. a pound.</p>

On the 7th of October, I saw Wilkinson with two persons named Marsden (the prisoner and another); they had a boat load of bales, which were taken ashore and put in my warehouse, which is in Middlesex; it is in the Lea-cut, on this side of the River Lea - the bales were unpacked by Wilkinson and the two Marsdens, they took the nux vomica out, and introduced any rubbish which they could get at the place, and sent the nux vomica in sacks to London - Sumner carted it, they were about eighteen hours unpacking it; Marsden's brother had taken my warehouse nearly a month before, and never put any thing in but once before - I do not know what became of the packages.</p>

            . I am a tide-waiter. On the 9th of October, Wilkinson came to the London Docks on board the York Merchant; he said he had thirty bundles of nux vomica for the ship; the Captain told him to bring it alongside, which he did - the whip was lowered down to get up the bags, it is a rope with a hook - the mate told Wilkinson to hook the bundles, he said</p>
               <p>"No, if I do, that will tear the bundles; give me a pair of slings, and I will sling them," which he did, and they were got into the ship - I took an account of them, they were marked C, from No. 4 to 33, and were put down in the main hatchway, and remained there while we were waiting for other goods to take into the hold - I was the officer on board, and booked them as nux vomica, my duty was to watch them - it was impossible they could be meddled with without my knowledge; they were examined in less than an hour after, in consequence of Albert's coming, they proved to be cinders and coal-ashes, and not nux vomica - I saw them all examined; the cinders were small, so that if a book broke a hole in the bag they would fall out; two or three wrappers were round them, but the book is large.</p>

            . I am a smith and farrier, and live in New Millman-street. Sheen came to me the begining of August. I owed him a little money, and told him I could not pay it; he asked me to make some bedstead screws - I gave him a loose paper of nails, and some small pins for the sacking. About the middle of September, he came and asked if I had made the screws, I said I had been busy, and had no opportunity, and gave him a square piece of iron about a foot long, to make them with, he looked round the shop, and saw six or seven bolts, and about three dozen nuts, and said he thought he could bring nuts for the screws, as he did not work late of an evening, and he thought he could make them near his own home - I said, "What nuts you have to spare, if you will tap them, I will be obliged to you" - he was to tap them with a coarser thread than I had got. The nails produced are very much like what he had of me - I did not give him the brace.</p>

            . I am assistant overseer of the parish. The first application the prisoner made to me, was in July, 1818, and in November, 1819, I had seen him relieved by the churchwardens - I told him I knew him to be an imposter, he denied it; I examined him, he gave me the same account as described in the examination, that he had lived with Mr. May, London-wall, as a yearly servant, for about sixteen months. I having been a neighbour of May's, knew it to be false - I laid him the money down, and told him to take it, at his peril. He took it.</p>

            . I am overseer of Christchurch. On the 6th of October the prisoner came to me respecting some clothes. I said I could give him none without an order from the churchwarden. He went away, and returned in about an hour, with a written order, as I supposed, from the churchwarden. I produce it. It was signed in Mr. Seward's name. I then gave him an order for a pair of shoes (looks at it), this is it. Since I gave it to him the figure 2 has been substituted. I merely said in it - pair; somebody has put in 2 - (read). Mills afterwards produced this order to me. I immediately sent for an officer, and had him apprehended.</p>

I heard the charge against him; I asked him after we got out of the shop, where he had taken the note - he said of his master, on the Saturday evening before, Mr. Turnor, a paper-hanger, at the corner of Queen-street, Lincoln's Inn-fields, for wages, and if I would go there with him, he dare say his master would be at home - I went up with him, but Mr. Turnor, was not at home; a woman there said he had worked there, but had not been there for two or three days, (I believe this was on Wednesday evening), she could not tell whether Mr. Turnor had paid him any wages, on the Saturday night or not. I accordingly brought him back to Warner's, he was not at home, and as he said he did receive it from his master, I kept the note and let him go, on his saying he would appear next day at Guildhall, with his master, and bring another note with him; previous to my letting him go, I asked where he lived, and to the best of my recollection, he said, No. 1, Garden-row, Willow-walk, Leonard-street, Shoreditch; I went there next morning, about nine o'clock, found he did live there, but was not at home - I then went to Mr. Turnor's. I attended at Guildhall, at eleven o'clock - I had told him to be there about half-past eleven o'clock, he never came; I was there till half-past twelve or one o'clock. I went in search of him, and found him that night at twelve o'clock, in bed at a public-house in Newgate-market (they let out lodgings to single men).

After the examination at Shadwell office, I searched them again, and found ten of the 30 s. which Parsons had, on South; this was the same day; they had had some refreshment; Parsons only had 18 s. then. I wrote my name on the note.</p>

            . I am a grocer, and live in Tabernacle-walk. I know the prisoner, he came to me with a 10 l. note on the 13th of February last, in the evening, and asked if I could give Mr. Bolton change for it; knowing Mr. Bolton to be a paper-hanger, of the City-road, I said Yes, and did it. When I gave him the change he said I might put his own name on it. I knew his name and put it on it. I knew he worked at a paper-hanger's, but did not know him to be in Mr. Bolton's service.</p>

            . I am a paper-hanger, and live in the City-road. The prisoner worked for me about six months before last February, as a journeyman, he finally left me at that time. I did not send him with a 10 l. note to Longsdon on the 13th of February. I know Mr. Longsdon as a neighbour, he lives about two hundred yards from me - I do not deal with him. The prisoner behaved very honest while with me - he did not live in my house.</p>

            . I was originally a signer of 1 l. and 2 l. notes; the signature is not my hand-writing - there is no other person of my name in the Bank.</p>
               <p>MR. GLOVER. (Looks at the one uttered the 25th of April.) This is forged in all respects, it is signed J. Lambert; he was a signer of 1 l. notes - this is not his writing - he was not authorized to sign 1 l. notes on the 14th of February, the date of the note (Looks at the other 1 l. note). This is forged in every respect, it is signed G. Gardiner; there was a clerk of that name authorized to sign 1 l. notes, but it is not his writing. The 10 l. note uttered to Longsdon is also forged in every respect. The two 10 l. notes are not both off one plate, one is dated 13th of February, 1821, the other the 10th of February, 1818.</p>

I gave the change to the young man who sent me, he is now transported, he gave me 4 l. for it. Longsdon sent to my mother's, I went and paid him the 4 l. again. I am quite innocent of it.</p>

I do not recollect the prisoner's person - a boy came to the house - I remember the last witness going down for some bottles of wine, and bringing them up; the boy who came on that occasion paid me for the wine with a 5 l. Bank note. I asked him what name I should put on the note, he said "Mr. Gregson, No. 6, Little Butcher-lane." I asked him if he meant Butcherhall-lane. He said it is all the same. He saw me write on it "Mr. Gregson, No. 6, Butcherhall-lane." (Looks at a note). This is it - I am sure I mentioned Butcher-hall-lane, and he said it was all the same.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any other transaction of this kind with any other boy on that day - A. No. This transaction was with the boy to whom the last witness delivered the basket and bottles. I gave him four sovereign and 3 s. and 4 d. change.</p>

            . I am a painter and glazier, and live at No. 6, Butcherhall-lane, Newgate-street, it is not called Little Butcher-lane - I know no such place. I have lived at No. 6, for nine years, and at No. 4, for sixteen years next March. I never saw the prisoner till I saw him here. I did not send him to Mr. Staples's, nor ever gave him a 5 l. note - I never had a lodger, and know no Mr. Gregson, or any name like it. There are about twenty houses in the lane. I know all the inhabitants.</p>

            . I keep the Brittannia, public-house, Nelson-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey. The prisoner came to my house on the 24th of July last, and asked for a pot of beer and half a pint of gin, and also asked me to change a 5 l. note for his brother William. I am sure he said his brother William. I had known the prisoner at this time about a month, by his living in the neighbourhood; he said his brother's surname was Sowerby. I gave him the change - he said his brother worked at Mr. Calow's, Blackfriars-road, a dyer's. (Looks at the note). This is the note I received of him. I wrote "W. Sowerby, Mr. Calow, Blackfriars-road;" and underneath, "Mr. Sowerby, 26, West-street, D. P." He lived at No. 26, West-street. I had served him with beer there, it is just by my house. He took the beer and gin away, and referred me to next door, No. 25, for the pot as his house was at that time shut up. I kept the note in my house a fortnight, and then paid it to my brewers; it was returned to me by them. I had not seen the prisoner from the time he paid it me. I believe he brought the pot back himself, almost immediately, but I did not see him until I saw him at Marlborough-street. I knew his brother by his coming for things - they both lived together.</p>

            . I am an inspector of Bank notes. (looks at that uttered to Jones) this is forged in all respects, the signature H. Whiting, is not his hand writing - the note uttered to Staples, is forged in all respects, nor is it the signature of H. Whiting; there is a person of that name, but he is not authorized to sign 5 l. notes; the other is also forged in every respect, and is signed W. R. West, there is such a cashier authorized to sign notes, The three notes appear to me to be impressed from the same plate, and the names Whiting, appears to be written by the same hand, and that of West, I think is the same writing as the other two.</p>
               <p>H. WHITING. I am not authorized to sign 5 l. notes, nor any person of my name - the signature on the two notes are neither of them my hand-writing. West's name appears written by the same hand.</p>

I went out, and saw the prisoner running away with it - I overtook him about three hundred yards off, and stopped him, I asked where he was taking them to, he said, a man gave them to him - one of my young men came after us, and picked them up; the prisoner had dropped them; it was a dirty evening, and they were all dirty - I took him back to the shop, they were taken from within the shop, not outside the door, about half a foot from it; he must have entered the house to have taken them; he might have reached them with his arm.</p>

On Tuesday, the 16th, about ten o'clock in the morning, I saw Hodegman go by Charing-cross with a woman; I seized him, and charged him with being concerned with Newman in a robbery; he said, Why did I not take him in St. James's-street, and refused to go with me, he resisted, his girl laid hold of me, and he escaped across the ruins into Cockspur-street - about an hour after, I saw him close to the Duke of Northumberland's, coming towards me; I told him to stop, he ran off towards the Horse-guards, and nearly upset every body who met him - an officer secured him, after some resistance.</p>

On Saturday fortnight, the day the houses fell, in St. James's-street, I was with him five minutes before the clock struck twelve, at Mr. Herring's, King-street, Soho, where my shopmates dine - I had not been to St. James's-street, I came out of Gerrard-street, where I work; I heard the clock strike after he came in, it is a wine-vaults - I believe I had some salt beef for dinner, Hodgeman's brother dined with me; we came out to dine at twelve o'clock, because we wanted a job (we usually dine at one o'clock), and did not return till two o'clock, as the porter would not be at the warehouse.</p>

Last Thursday or Friday fortnight, he was in company with me and Grose, from twelve o'clock till past two, at a house in Macclesfield-street, Newport-market; it joins Gerrard-street - the house is kept by Herring.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be there so long - A. My master had hurt his eye, and the doctor came to dress it at twelve o'clock, so we could get no work, and went to dinner; he was with us both days; I had some beef steaks and gave him some, and some bread and cheese - I think Grose had salt beef; Grose and I went in together, and he came in directly after, he came to ask my master for a job on both days.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have given him an answer on Thursday - A. I could not see my master to give him an answer, We often go to dinner at twelve o'clock; I do not know why we went the other day.</p>

On Sunday, the 5th of October, about ten minutes before ten o'clock in the morning, my fellow-servant came up and gave me information - I looked out of window and saw the prisoner with two others against the rails of the square, I watched and saw him go down the area. I went out of the front door and locked the area gate, he was then inside the house - he came up in a moment, I asked who he wanted - he said Mr. Sidney, Lord Sidney's coachman (Lord Sidney lives next door), I said "You know where Lord Sidney lives, his name is on the door - you came here to steal." He said a gentleman sent him, he could not tell who he was or what he sent him for; he had a parcel under his arm, I do not know what it was. I got a person to mind him while I went round another way, and then he had thrown the parcel in the coal-hole, it contained two pounds of tea, and belonged to

            . I am foreman to the London Dock Company. I was in the warehouse at the Docks, about half story high, and saw the prisoner with a waggon load of lump sugar unloading it. It was Kerrison's waggon. I saw him take a lump of sugar from the bulk, and attempt to put it under his apron. I immediately turned round and went into the warehouse, it was then four o'clock, at which time we leave work. I desired the men to leave the floor, and assist him to cover the waggon. I then observed something strange in his gait, and sent a man to give information at the gate, and saw a piece of sugar taken from his breeches, and another piece from his jacket pocket, they weighed about 6 lb. I weighed the bulk it was 10 lb. deficient.</p>

On the 17th of September, between one and two o'clock, the prisoner came into the shop and asked to see a pair of black worsted stockings. I took a pair down from the door and gave them to her, she said she would not have them, but would have a pair out of a bundle; the bundle was reached down and opened - she looked at them a long time, and I saw her slip a pair down on the floor. I stood at her side. After looking at them some time she stooped down and put her hand into her pocket-hole, and drew them up under her clothes into her pocket - the bundle got lose, and I thought she had taken another pair. I said "Do you intend to have a pair?" she then offered me 15 d. for a pair, but I refused them for less than 18 d. She walked to the door. I followed, tapped<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240033"/>her on the shoulder, and said</p>
               <p>"Give me the stockings you have taken." She said she had none, and presently put her hand down and dropped them down the same way she had drawn them up; she put them on the counter; and said there is your stockings. She only returned one pair. She was going away, I said, "I rather think you have another pair, and I will send for an officer." She said she had no more. I sent for an officer. We found three pair on her, one of them was ours. She had only 11 1/2 d. in her pocket. We live in Whitechapel-road.</p>

I had seen the prisoners following the waggon from Mile End to the Salmon and Ball, public-house. They were walking together, sometimes round the waggon, and then on the footpath; they must get under the waggon to get it. I was by the side of the horses. Two gentlemen came by in a chaise, and said they were running away with it. I stopped my horses, went on a bank, and saw Batty three or four hundred yards off, with a coat under his arm. Pratt was two or three paces before him, I followed, Batty dropped the coat into a ditch, and then walked away. I caught hold of him - he said he did it from want. Pratt ran off and was taken in about an hour. I am sure he is the boy.</p>

               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. When Mr. King saw them, were they in the same paper - A. Yes; it was untied, I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240035"/>leave the room before he saw them - no other parcel of spoons was brought to me.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK KING. I am a linen-draper, and live in St. John-street. I gave Mr. Upjohn's mother an order for a dozen spoons, about August last, I never gave them any other order. When I came home one evening, I saw them on the dining-room mantle-piece, on the first floor - Mrs. King was present, I did not count them, each spoon was enclosed in silver paper, and brown paper round them; those produced resemble them in appearance and shape.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this room always called a dining-room - A. They call it a bed-room, the child sleeps in it sometimes.</p>
               <p>MRS. KING. The spoons were put on our bed-room mantle-piece, where I and my husband sleep.</p>
               <p>MR. KING. They were not there when I saw them, nor afterwards; I never had any like them - I took them off the mantle-piece, looked at them, thought them charged too high, and gave one to Mendham to take to Goldsmith's-hall, to the deputy-warden - I afterwards took five of them from a box and gave them to Mr. Cook - they were only in silver paper then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. You saw them in the dining-room - Yes; I do not know who put them in the box - I did not attend before the Justice; I went to the solicitor for the prosecution, I did not see one Wintle there; I never heard his name before - I sent the spoons to Goldsmith's-hall, as I thought them not good silver.</p>
               <p>MRS. KING. I delivered six of them to

            . I am inspector and marker of silver plate at Goldsmith's-hall, and have been so thirteen years. Every manufacturer brings a punch with his initials to the hall, and an impression is taken from it on pewter - it has the initial of the Christian and sirname of the manufacturer. The punch is returned to the manufacturer, and an impression taken from it, is kept in charge of the deputy warden, I produce it, that taken from the prisoner punch - the person is dead who took it. The stamp is entered in the Companys book, and signed by the manufacturer at the time, it is taken off, I produce the book; the entry is signed by the prisoner - I have every reason to believe it is his signature, from my knowledge of his writing; the date of the entry is the 18th of September, 1810, and is made by

            , who is now dead, he also took the impression; this is the Company's book, in which the transaction is entered. I produce a pewter plate with the initials W. W. on it - it corresponds with the entry, and I have the punch, which made the stamp (producing it) the prisoner delivered it to me at his house: he was in the habit of sending plate to the hall to be marked, it always came with this stamp. The spoons are marked with this punch - I have no doubt of it, it has been my business to examine the stamps, for the last thirteen or fourteen years - when they have a new punch, it must be entered a fresh at the hall, and the punch must be different. I find no subsequent entry to this; if plate came with a fresh mark, I should detain it, till the new punch was brought forward - two punches can never be alike. An impression is taken off in the book as well as on pewter - he has used this punch from the date of the entry till now.</p>
               <p>Q. When a manufacturer brings an article to the hall, what is done with it - A. It is often delivered to me; it is then weighed, and taken to another office, where it is assayed, and if it is the standard, it is delivered to the stamper, who stamps it with the Company's, and the King's mark, which are a Leopard's head, a Lion passant, and a variable letter for the year, the stamp is made, the King's head is the Government stamp, denoting that the duty is paid - all these stamps are made by one punch.

               <p>Q. Are articles brought to be stamped, in a rough or polished state - A. Rough; they are polished afterwards by the maker.</p>
               <p>Q. Examine these seven spoons carefully, are the stamps genuine or not - A. I have not the least doubt of there being all forged, and so are those on the five. I speak from my general knowledge of the stamps, it has been my business to inspect them for the last fourteen years.</p>
               <p>Q. You and three officers went to the prisoner's house - A. Yes; on the 6th of October, it is in King-street, Islington. Armstrong, Jun. was one of the officers - we found the prisoner at home, I went into the back workshop, and found his two sons at work polishing twelve tea spoons, which I took from them - I found four dozen tea spoons, with genuine marks, and three pair of sugar tongs,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240036"/>all with the genuine marks on. I produce the tongs, they have not been bent into shape, the stamps on the tongs appear to have been hammered very much since they left the hall.</p>
               <p>Q. Can any person procure the appearence of the legitimate stamp, by hammering on this genuine stamp - A. By laying an unstamped piece of plate on in, with a smart stroke, he could get the reverse, and the reverse would be useful to forge a stamp with - it can be done, I have not the least doubt, for I have tried it; I think the sugar tongs bear the appearence of having been so used - they are not polished; the twelve spoons bear every appearence of having been stamped in that way, an instrument made in that way, would make precisely the same mark as on these - the edges are considerable blunter than if made by the original stamp. I have a real tea spoon stamp. I am confident the marks on the spoons, have not been done with a genuine stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at these twelve spoons found in the prisoner's workshop - A. The stamps on them are forged, I am certain, and appear to have been made in the way I mention - there is not that impression on them, which there would have been had they been done by the original instrument. They bear the prisoner's initials, marked with his punch. Soft silver would have the same impression as hard.</p>
               <p>Q. After the spoons, and tongs were found, did you see the prisoner - A. I did, and asked him for his mark punch; he unlocked his counting-house door, and gave me that which I produce - I asked for his books, he said he kept none; I said from information I had received I was confident he must keep books - he made no answer, I said I hoped he would produce them, or I must direct the officers to make further search; he then gave me these books which I have examined.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the 31st of August, and see if you find an entry of this transaction - A. Yes. (reads) "31st of August, Upjohn, one dozen of fiddle teas." I have examined the book from the 29th of May, to the 1st of October, it appears that in that interval he sold 914 ounces three pennyweights of plate. On the 28th of June there is an entry of three dozen teas, a pair of sugar tongs, and two fiddled gravy spoons, to

               <p>MR. WALFORD. Q. Is there an entry of the duties being paid - A. On the 6th of July, there is an entry of the duty being paid, and on the 8th of June, to Peachey's goods, twenty-eight ounces eleven pennyweights 2 l. 2 s. 2 d., and on the 31st of August, Upjohn's duty 11 s. 2 s., on the 28th of June, Walter's thirty-nine ounces fifteen penny-weights, duty 2 l. 19 s. 8 d.,</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. The person is dead who kept the book where the punch is entered - A. Yes. I only know the prisoner's punch mark, by looking at the plate and book - we have a general knowledge of the people's marks, I believe the signature in the book to be the prisoner's writing, I have no doubt whatever of it, from my knowledge of his writing, without other circumstances. I found nothing at his house which could make the forged impression - our punches are of steel. The prisoner did not know we were coming to search his house, only his sons were at work.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Wintle, who was tried here - A. Yes; I did not see him at either of the examinations. The duty is 1 s. 6 d. per ounce; the spoons weigh seven ounces nine pennyweights. The polishing ought not to take away any of the impression, they send them to us as smooth as they possibly can; the polishing does not remove the clear impression, it merely takes off the sharpness; I never said that it was impossible to tell whether the stamp on light spoons was correct. Before the examination, Mr. Barrow asked my opinion on the plate, and I gave it him - I occasionally use a magnifying-glass, I do not think I did on this occasion; I gave my opinion first, and afterwards took my glass to examine them, as it comes so habitual to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Barrow say he thought the impressions fair, and you replied that it might be so, but it was difficult to ascertain whether they were forged or not - A. Such conversation never took place, I never thought the stamp on the tongs was forged.</p>
               <p>MR. BARROW. I never said to any one that it was nice and difficult to say whether the stamps on the spoons were forged or not.</p>

             re-examined. Q. You have tried the experiment of getting the reverse of the original stamp - A. I have tried it with silver; a stamp so obtained, would soon be worn out and become blunt, and I should think would not stamp above four or five. If polishing is done skillfully, it will not at all injure the stamp.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this spoon, has it a genuine stamp - A. It has; and is finished. There is scarcely any difference in this impression from when it was made; here are twelve with genuine stamps which are not at all injured in polishing, two of the twelve forged ones appear to have received more injury than the rest - the sharpness is merely taken off.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Then they appear deteriorated - A. The sharpness is off.</p>
               <p>Q. Must not an impression taken from the tongs be in all its parts a counterpart of the original, though not so plain - A. Precisely the same mark; those which I say are made from impressions taken from the tongs, are those found in his work-shop, not those indicted on - I have no doubt that those in question are made by silver punches, taken from genuine marks; I cannot possibly be deceived in distinguishing between that and a mark from the genuine stamp; they stand in the same form, but there is a material difference between the impression of this and the Company's steel punch; a silver mark cannot give the same impression as a steel one.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. It is possible that he might make a steel punch instead of a silver one - A. The genuine mark is altogether different; we have no private mark.</p>

            . I am engraver to the Goldsmith's Company. I engraved the instrument which makes the Hall and Government stamp, and have done so for fourteen years; marks made by a steel punch would be different from any made by silver or any other metal. The marks on the seven spoons are all counterfeit, I should conceive they were never made by a steel punch, but can positively swear they were not made by the instrument I made; the punch is engraved entirely by myself. I never tried how a mark might be made without a steel punch; I am also certain that the other five are not made by the punch which I engraved, and are not the marks of the steel punch used at the Hall.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are they made with a steel punch - A. They cannot; if it had, it would not be convex, there is a convexity round the Lion, which could not be if it were done with a steel punch, as they are always flat and hard - I cannot say what metal it is made with, but it is not steel. It certainly requires great experience to detect these stamps, I believe I am the most accomplished in this art. I had some conversation with Mr. Lane about the sugar-tongs, I did not express a doubt of the stamps on them being genuine; I took a magnifier to examine them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say "It may be so, but they do it with such a nicety, that it is difficult to tell whether the stamp is correct or not" - A. I think those words were used, with reference to the spoons, but not to the tongs.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. Is it with reference to your being the maker, or your general knowledge, that you think yourself the only likely person able to judge whether they are forged - A. I think myself the only person, as I made it; the opinion I gave of the spoons was, that they were decidedly forged, I never doubted it, I never said it was impossible to judge, for they were done to such a nicety - I expressed no doubt about it to Lane, not of my own opinion.</p>

            . I am a pawnbroker. On the 28th of June, I gave the prisoner an order for two pair of gravy spoons; Mr. Miles took one pair away (looks at a pair) they were like these, I had none but what I had of the prisoner - they have W. W. on them.</p>

            . I am a silversmith, and live in Goswell-street. I employed the prisoner to make silver articles for me; I have a bill of parcels dated the 8th of June, for thirty tea-spoons, there are eighteen added to this bill which I had on the 1st of May; I gave Mr. Miles eight of them last Saturday week, they were spoons which I received of the prisoner, but I cannot say when - they have his mark, W. W. on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you aware this man is being tried for his life - A. Yes; I cannot swear they were part of the forty-eight spoons mentioned in this bill, or that I had them from his hands, but they come to me in consequence of orders I gave him; I never recollect any being brought but by him or his sons, one of whom is grown up - I have dealt five years with him.</p>
               <p>MR. NORTON. Q. He has brought you spoons with his own hands - Yes; and they were marked W. W. the same as these.</p>

             re-examined. The two gravy-spoons have the Leopard's-head, Lion's-head, and date mark, they are forged, and so are eight from Peachey's.</p>
               <p>MR. SMITH. The marks on the gravy-spoons are forged, and so are those on the eight tea-spoons; the ground or shield is rose convex above the letters, the convexity could not appear if it was done with the proper stamp, and the shield round the impression is spread. and not a correct oval, but battered in - I think it is a little larger, but striking deep or shallow would have that effect.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. The witness Miles, I am sorry to say, has spoken very wrong; he says I rather refused to give up what he asked for; but the moment they came in I readily shewed them every thing. When I saw them there were five or six of them, they came right into the shop, and fortunate enough for me, had they been half an hour later I should have put the four dozen they sent back into the very state of the three pair of tongs they say I had taken an impression from. Work goes in the rough to the Hall and comes back in various states; sometimes it is almost cut through with the mark, and at other times they are so faint you can hardly see them, and we are obliged to hammer them and take as little off as we possibly can, as we pay duty before it goes, though they make a small allowance. It was never my intention to injure any one. He asked for my books or something - I said my accounts were very short; but such as they were I gave them. I never had but one mark since I have been in business. If there is any thing that bears the appearance of forgery it must be some evil-designed bad person out of doors who has been the cause of it. I am rather in the decline of life, and my faculties rather decline, and for some time past I have not worked myself but left it to my sons.</p>
               <p>JURY to MILES. Q. Are the same sized stamps used to all silver - A. They are different sizes, but the same impression. All tea-spoons are marked with the same impression.</p>

On the 9th of October, about half-past eight o'clock at night, the prisoner came in and called for a glass of gin and water; I took him a silver spoon with it, and staid in the house looking after him some time, as I suspected him, then I went out and as I returned I saw him coming out. My brother ran out, and said he had taken a spoon. I collared him - he appeared surprised - I said it was of no use for we had lost ten spoons, and I would not let him go; he then produced it, and begged for mercy. I had marked it before I gave it him; he had left a plated one instead of it.</p>

He was to bring it back as soon<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240039"/>as he could. He said I should always find him at the watering-house. He never returned it. I found him on the 6th of October at a public-house, at the corner of Quebec-street; before I spoke to him he said "I have not got your carpet." I went to speak to the landlady, and he went away. I saw him a quarter of an hour after at the General Townsend, public-house, in Oxford-street, but said nothing to him. On the 9th I met him again, and said he had stolen the carpet. He said "No I have not, I shall be obliged if you will let me go, I will come back again." I took him to the office.</p>

            . I am an officer of St. Sepulchre's. On the 7th of October I was coming down the City-road with Keys, just as Westley's chapel was over. I heard a noise made, which is a signal among thieves. I looked across and saw seven or eight lads running after a gentleman - the prisoners were two of them. I had noticed Hendley two or three times before - he was always at the head of the boys. He tried a gentleman's pocket, the gentleman felt it, and followed them up and down the pavement to watch them. I saw them attempt several pockets, and by Chiswell-street the prisoners parted from the rest, and followed a lady and gentleman down <placeName id="t18211024-75-crimeloc436">Finsbury-place</placeName>

I saw Foxon receive a handkerchief from Hendley, and put it into his jacket pocket. I went up and took it out of his hand; it was this handkerchief - I am sure it is what they took from the gentleman's pocket, for I did not lose sight of it. They crossed and went down by Lackington's, and each stood up in a different doorway, I took Foxon and Keys took Hendley. I could not find the gentleman, or I should have lost the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. You could have called out - A. I was afraid of losing them, they had got two or three hundred yards before we took them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BARRY. Q. You could not see what was taken from the pocket - A. Not till I saw the handkerchief go from one to the other. There were a great many people in the street. I am a constable of St. Sepulchre's - I was here two nights ago as a witness. Keys and I had been to Islington.</p>

The watchman could not manage him, he did not get from him; three more watchmen came and secured him - I have not been well since it happened.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the watchman get the bonnet and handkerchief from him - A. No; there was a number of them there, who threatened what they would do if he was not let go - one of them came up, and the bonnet was found in the passage of the house where I live, with the ribbons torn off; I did not see what the prisoner did with it - the blows I received prevented my observing what he did with it - The handkerchief has never been found.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see the man who came up and threatened what he would do - A. It was a woman; she came up as the watchman was taking him away - I am sure of the prisoner's person.</p>

            . I am a watchman of Whitechapel, my box is about 300 yards from Alderson's house. On the 18th of October, about half-past eleven o'clock, she came running down crying out Watch! Watch! and the prisoner was running after her - she ran up to me, and said I am in danger of my life, she had neither bonnet or handkerchief on; he ran up to her, and said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, I will kill you;" and hit her two or three times, he caught hold of her arm, and if I had not hindered him, I think he would have broken it - he said "D - n your eyes, I will knock your brains out;" I secured him, he was never out of my sight. She said he had robbed her of a shilling, her bonnet and her handkerchief off her neck - I sprung my rattle, got more assistance, and took him to Whitechapel watch-house, which is about 150 yards off - he was then taken to a more secure place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any persons interfere with you - A. He was so very outrageous, I could only attend to him, it was as much as I could do to hold him; when he was taken to the watch-house, he was obliged to be handcuffed, or he would have torn the place to pieces. Alderson seemed very much frightened, and said she was much hurt - I think the prisoner had been drinking, but he knew well what he was doing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I came home at twelve o'clock from Hyde-park corner, where I had been to carry a box, I came into Rosemary-lane, this woman came up, and asked me to go home with her, I said, "No, I do not want you;" she followed me to Red Lion-street, and then sung out for a watchman, and said I took her bonnet away - I said I knew nothing of her bonnet; I told the watchman she wanted me to go home with her. The watchman hauled me about, and struck me over the eye, with a stick - they took me to the watch-house, and tied my hands together. I know nothing of her things.</p>

            . I am a pewterer, and live in George-yard, Old-street. On the 3d of October, about ten o'clock in the morning, Mr. Jeave, and I were sitting in his parlour, and about twelve o'clock, the prisoner brought a pot of beer, I took it of him - he went away as I thought. Jeave and I were in conversation for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour - I was then going into the yard, and passed the bed-room door, saw a shadow, went into the room, and saw the prisoner there, I asked what he was doing - he said he was playing with the parrot - there was one in the room; he went out about his business. I told Jeave, he said he thought him honest, and had no suspicion.</p>

This woman keeps a house of ill-fame, and whenever I went there, she asked if I had any money to treat her with gin, and if I had none, she would persuade me to pawn my clothes. One day she took my handkerchief off my neck, and said she would lend me 6 d. on it, to buy gin, and in the afternoon she said she would lend me another 6 d. on it, if I spent it, and next day, she offered 1 s., 6 d., more if I would spend 6 d.; she gave me 6 d. for the duplicate of a pair of stockings, and said if I could get her duplicates of anything, she would buy them, let them be what they would, and said I could not be without money in such a house as I lived in. As to these things,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240042"/>I went for my pots at nine o'clock in the morning, she asked if I had any money to toss for gin, I said No. She sent me for a pot of beer, and asked me to drink, and after waiting about five minutes looking at the parrot, she told me to give it some bread, and as I came into passage, I kicked against something and found it was a thimble - the ring and padlocks laid by the side of the drawers; this gentleman came in the passage, and said Hallo!

            . I have the care of the Adelphi Theatre. On the 3d of October I was coming down Broad-street, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240043"/>saw the child surrounded by the three prisoners - I am sure of them - they pushed the child against a hoard. I was crossing over to see what they were doing, when they all three ran off up Compton-street. The child put her hands up to her face and began crying; and in consequence of what she said I went after them, leaving her in care of a woman. I overtook them all three at the Seven-dials - Anderson slipped away, but was stopped and brought back immediately. The other two said they did not take it, but Anderson did - and he said it was the other two, but they wanted to lay it upon him, because he was the least, and if he attempted to say any other way they would wallop him. A mob collected, and the street-keeper came up. I picked the necklace up in the Green-yard (near the church), where the prisoners had been put. Pendergrass came and said if I would forgive him he would tell me where it was - and that Anderson took it, and threw it in the dirt, where I found it.</p>

She said she had made away with the sheets and blankets, and gave me the duplicate of a sheet and blanket, another duplicate was found in her room.</p>

            . I sell fruit and other things in the street.

I afterwards saw her with money in her hand looking for the prosecutrix.</p>
               <p>Q. When were you applied to about this - A. She sent for me when she was in prison. I went to her last Monday; she said as I saw the woman give her the shirt, I should come down.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you - A. In Clare-street. The prisoner asked the prosecutrix if she should help her down with her pail of oysters. She told her to take the shirt, she was to bring her the money. She generally stood in Clare-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she appoint any place for her to bring the money to - A. I did not stop to hear. There is a wine-vaults just by, and I went in to see the time - it was ten o'clock. I wished to know the time as I was going for oysters, and Billingsgate is generally shut at twelve. I live in Little Wild-street. I could not go to Billingsgate as I wanted to bring out my stand, and it was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. What ten o'clock too late to go - A. I had not money enough, I went to Drury-lane, and met the prisoner; she said I have got the money for Mrs. so and so. I said "You ought to be ashamed of yourself to be seen in such company;" for I had often seen her tipsy in the street, and the prisoner was quite tipsy. The prisoner lived servant with me when I was in the milk business, and bore a good character.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath has she not been in custody - A. I never heard it.</p>

While she was drinking, I fell into a doze for a quarter of an hour, and when I awoke I missed my silk handkerchief from round my neck, and my tobacco-box and another handkerchief from my pocket - I saw her running out, ran after her about three hundred yards, took her, and gave her to the watchman - she ran out as soon as she saw me awake; she said she had none of my property; the watchman found the handkerchief and box - I had drank a little, but was more tired than drunk.</p>

About four o'clock I saw the prisoners in company, Young was concealing something under his jacket - I watched and saw him change it from one side to the other, and then he gave it to Barber, and pointed to him to go across the fields with it, he took it, and I followed him across the common, and about ten yards before I got to him he dropped it - I secured him, he said he found it, it was this pelisse; I first saw them about 150 yards from Sheffield's.</p>

He was taken in three or four hours.</p>

            . I am an apprentice on board the brig. On Sunday the 14th of October, I went ashore with the prisoner, and left him in the dock - he said he was going out of the dock; I went on board another vessel, returned directly, and met him coming from the vessel, we went to the Three Crowns, public-house, and had a pot of beer - nobody but him was on board. I found two chests removed, which rose my suspicion.</p>

            . I am a Thames Police officer. On the 15th of October, I found the prisoner at the Scotch Arms, public-house, close to the dock, drinking - I told him, I took him for breaking open the carpenter's chest on board the ship, and taking four sovereigns and a guinea, and asked what he had done with the money - he said, he knew nothing of it. As I took him to the office, I asked if he had left a sovereign and guinea in the hands of any body, he said he had not - I asked if he had changed them any where, he said he had not; then I asked if he had left some sovereigns in the hands of the landlady of the St. Andrew tavern - he said he had not, and that he had none to leave with any one - I found 4 s. 6 d., on him. The landlady of the St. Andrew tavern gave me two sovereigns and two shillings. A friend said in his presence, that he would refund the money for him, if he could have his liberty, he said nothing to it; I said I could not take it, he then advised him to say nothing about it.</p>

The bread was in two baskets, the prisoner came up alone, and put it out of the large into the small basket, and carried it across Oxford-street. I stopped him.</p>

I went to the prisoner's, I had been there twice before, and told the officers what had passed, On going in I told her I had come for some more shillings - she asked how many I wanted - I told her seven. She went to a place in the room, which she went to an a former occasion; she took them from there, sat down in a chair by the fire, took the poker out and placed the shillings on the hot poker, then put them in a mug of water, put something out of a paper into the mug, and washed them with it; then wiped them with a cloth and gave them to me. I gave her 2 s. 4 d. for seven. I gave her the same money Gleed gave me. I came down and went into the barber's shop. Hanley came in and took from me the same shillings which I had from her.</p>

            . I am a constable of St. Luke's. I met Isaacson by appointment in Fetter-lane, on the 23d of October; Gleed and Kennedy were with me. Gleed marked some money at the White Hart, public-house, Fetter-lane, and gave it to him. We followed him to Charles-street, Drury-lane, and saw him go into the house. If he succeeded he was to go into the barber's shop - I saw him in the shop, and went in and found seven counterfeit shillings on him, which I produce. Gleed and Kennedy went up stairs - I took him up stairs with me; he pointed to the prisoner, and said "That is the woman who sold me the money." Gleed searched her and found the marked money on her. He asked her how she came by it? she said she took it of her lodgers. There was only a boy about fourteen years old in the room.</p>

            . I am assistant to the solicitors of the Mint, and have been so nearly thirty years. The seven shillings are all counterfeits, have never been in circulation, and are all from the same dye. There is a flaw in the dye - They are base metal - merely washed. The half-crowns are also counterfeits, and merely washed, and all three from the same dye.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This man came up and asked for Mrs. Kelly. I was getting the men's breakfast, and told him no such person was there; the other man said, "Come here and warm your hands, here is a nice fire." I went down for a pail of water, and left them in the room. When I came up I found this money on the cloth. I supposed my lodger had left it for me to get his dinner. I was blowing the fire - these gentlemen came up and said, "Is not your name Kelly?" I said No; and shewed them my certificate. I knew nothing of the half-crowns - it is done out of spite, because I gave information against one Callagan.</p>

We keep our oil in a house in Warwick-street, which communicates with the shop - two or three days before he was apprehended, I saw about four gallons of oil in a can, in a recess in the back warehouse, it was not the place for it, I saw it there on Saturday and Monday night; he was taken on Tuesday - I never spoke to him about it. It was Mr. Slark's can, I put a mark on it when I first found it there. About eight o'clock on the Tuesday morning, the officer brought the same can back to the shop - the four gallons of oil are worth 1 l. 2 s., and the can 4 s.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Your house has an entrance from Cockspur-street, and another from Warwick-street - A. Yes; the oil is kept in the Warwick-street premises. the can was used to carry out oil in - we sometimes leave cans with customers, and have them back when empty - we have a porter and a shopman, besides Coleby - only the shopman was in town at the time; his name is Baker, he absconded on the Tuesday following Coleby's apprehension - I owed him no wages. Neither of them slept on the premises.</p>
               <p>Q. On the morning Coleby was taken, did you let him in - A. No; the female servant did, he usually came about six o'clock; I came into the shop at a quarter past seven o'clock - I knew the officers were to be on the watch at six. I found Coleby at his business, when I came down, he was dressed in a light-coloured jacket, which he usually wore; he generally wore a white apron, I cannot say whether he had it on - I looked for the can, it was then gone, I saw it there the night before; Baker generally came after breakfast; I saw him there at eight<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240050"/>o'clock that morning, he sometimes came before breakfast, he was not there when I came down stairs - the officers brought the can about half-past eight o'clock; I had marked my initials on it with a fork - Coleby asked leave to go to breakfast as the clock struck eight, the officer came in at that moment and stopped him - I said nothing to him about the can.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRINSEP. Q. Was it Coleby's business to serve out oil to the lamplighters - A. Yes; at times. Jones was an extra man.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you see Baker at the shop on the morning Coleby was apprehended - A. Yes; about five or ten minutes; there are houses opposite the back premises, but none in front, the window of my room commands a view of Warwick-street; nobody could pass that way without my seeing them, if I was out of bed.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 18th of September, I and Clinton were in attendance in Cockspur-street, at a quarter before six o'clock; I stationed myself behind a hoard where I had a full view of the shop, and at a quarter past six, I saw Coleby unscrewing his master's shutters, and observed him looking towards the piazza of the Opera-house - he nodded his head, as if to call a person, and then beckoned with his fingers; immediately after, the prisoner Jones came up from that direction - I saw Coleby run into the shop and go backwards; Jones was then just within the door, Coleby brought out a can from the back part of the shop, and gave it to Jones, who put it on his left shoulder and went to the Opera-house, under the Piazza, to the corner of Charles-street, turned round, looked about him, and then went up the Haymarket, up Coventry-street, to the door of No. 35, Greek-street, Soho - he put the can off his shoulder and rang the bell, it appeared a private house; I went by before the door was opened, and saw the can standing at the door and another alongside it; I do not know how that came there (Clinton was rather before me), I passed by, took no notice, and in a moment the door was opened (I could not see who by) and shut uncommonly quick - Jones was shut in and took the two cans in; Clinton and I immediately got to the door, he forced it open with his hands, as the bolt had not quite shot, and another door inside the passage was nearly shut before we got to it, they shut it inside, it was only single latched - we opened it, and immediately laid hold of Jones and asked where he brought that can from (the two were in sight) he said he found it under the Piazza; we asked young Warner, who stood by (dressed in his night-gown, without shoes, stockings, or breeches) if he knew him, he said it was "Old Jones." His father hearing the noise, came down, and asked what was the matter - the son said "It was only Old Jones;" and either said That he had got something, or he had got oil, I do not know which - we asked if Jones lodged in the house, the son, in the hearing of the father, said No; and denied knowing him, I believe both denied knowing him, but it was in the father's hearing - he stood naked on the stairs, I had Jones then in custody.</p>
               <p>Q. When Warner said he did not know Jones, did you hear the father say any thing - A. I did not hear, I was then taking care of Jones. We took both father and son into custody, and when they had dressed themselves, we took them to Bow-street, and then to St. Martin's watch-house. The cans of oil were put in a house next door to Warner's; we fetched them and took them to Bow-street, both were full of oil; Mr. Edensor saw them at Bow-street. After apprehending them, we went to Slark's and took Coleby.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. You are a City officer - A. I am constable of St. Vedas, Foster-lane. I was first applied to on Friday, and saw Coleby that day, I knew then that he was suspected; I went there with the impression that he was suspected - Mr. Slark's shop is near the end of Sussex-street, I was the width of the street from them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and Clinton talked about Coleby's dress - A. We talked about his dress as we went along together to wait for them - he had a fustian jacket on, and opened the shop in that dress; I cannot say whether he had an apron on, I think he was described to me as having a white jacket on; I might describe it as white, it was between white and brown - he was in sight four or five minutes, I knew him before - Jones had a blue jacket on.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. At what time in the morning did you see the cans left at the door in Greek-street - A. I suppose better than half-past six o'clock, we entered the house instantly, only young Warner was present when I first went in. There is a fan-light over the street door, it was very light in the passage; and after passing the inside door, there is a light from the staircase; Warner was not a yard from Jones, and the oil stood at Jones's feet, as if he had just set it down. There is but one door to the house, Jones said he found it under the Piazza; it was after that I asked Warner if he knew him, and he said it was "Old Jones" - the father came down after that, and the son said "Here is old Jones, and he has got some oil, or has got something - Clinton asked what room the man lodged in, they said he did not lodge there; Clinton then asked old Warner what room he lodged in, he said, up stairs, and Clinton went up - they denied knowing where Jones lodged; then Warner wanted to go up stairs to dress - they did not at first deny knowing Jones, but denied knowing where he lodged; they afterwards said they did not know him - a man came out of a room on the ground floor, just shewed himself, and asked what noise that was, I do not know what answer was made, he shut the door and went in directly. I believe he was in his shirt - a man, who appeared to be a coachman, came down, and Warner's wife came down, I do not know whether she or her husband came down first, I believe both came down nearly together - I was engaged with Jones and young Warner, and cannot say what passed on the stairs.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Are you sure Coleby is the man - A. Yes; I had seen him three times before, and had been watching him there twice before - I believe the father was on the stairs when the man put his head out to ask about the noise - I had not seen Jones before that morning.</p>

            . I am a City officer. On the 18th of September, I accompanied Sheppard to watch this house. We sat down at the corner of Cockspur-street about half-past five o'clock, and about a quarter past six, saw Coleby come from Spring-garden gates, and go to his master's -<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240051"/>he entered the back door in Warwick-street, came out in front in Cockspur-street, took down the bar of the left hand shutter, stood with it on his hand, and nodded his head to beckon to some one, and then beckoned with his hand - I was exactly opposite, not concealed, a coach or cart passed, so that I could not see him for a moment, but when that moved, I saw Jones two or three yards inside the door - I saw him with his right hand receive a can from Coleby and put it on his left shoulder, then walk out of the shop to the Opera Piazza. and at the end of the Piazza, he turned round to look about him - I was then very near him, and took out my watch to avoid suspicion, and set it by St. James's clock, he then went on through different courts and streets, I never lost sight of him till he went to the door of No. 35, Greek-street - he never looked behind, he took the can off his shoulder and put it on the step of the door on the left side, and in a second or so, another man came up with another can and placed that by it, said something to Jones and went off immediately, Sheppard was turning the corner at the time; the house is about three doors from a street, he was behind me - I then spoke to a butcher's boy next door, to avoid suspicion, and in the mean time the door was opened and Jones went in with both cans, and the door was closed immediately; I rushed against it twice, and the second time burst it open and entered a passage with a door to it, which I pushed open, and saw Jones with the cans of oil, one on each side of him, and young Warner naked, all but his bed gown, he attempted to go up stairs, I stopped him, asked Sheppard for a pair of handcuffs which I put on Jones, and asked young Warner if Jones lodged there, and in what room, he said he did not know, he knew nothing of the man - his mother came down undressed, and said "Good God! what is the matter;" he said "I do not know, here is Old Jones" - I asked Jones how he came by the oil, he said he found it in the Haymarket; young Warner wanted his clothes, I said I would go up and fetch them - I followed his mother up into the one pair of stairs front room, and found the bed-clothes down, as if he had just got out; his shoes were by the bed side - the father was in the back room, dressing himself, and rubbing his eyes, which were wet.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that the first time you saw him - A. It was, I asked him if he had any oil about the place, he said No; he was very willing that I should search, and his wife opened a box of linen, there was none there - I found none in those two bed-rooms - I came down and asked young Warner to shew me the cellar where he kept his oil, he said "Let me go up stairs and fetch my boots and handkerchief" - I went and got them from the room, he put them on, and then took me to a yard at the back of the house; I said "This is not the place "- I went to the cellar where the oil is kept, he said he had none; I said I would not be trifled with, and down stairs he should go - when I got to the bottom of the kitchen stairs, I spied a door open on the left hand, where there were three very large oil cans, all empty - I said I should look to see if they had any mark to lead to any thing, he said nothing - I then went along a passage under ground, and found a door rather open, and thought I heard a latch go; young Warner was rather before me; I told him to stop, and said"Is there not somebody in that room?" he said "No, nobody at all;" I knocked at the door, and a female answered from within "We are two lone women, and are naked" - I said I only wanted to ask a question, as Warner had deceived me - I could not believe him; she opened the door, pointed to a cellar, and said "That is Mr. Warner's cellar" - Warner said it was locked, but I might break it open; Mrs. Warner brought the key down, and there I found two cans of oil, a funnel, and a quart measure; I came up with Warner, the father was coming down stairs, and I believe he said "For God's sake, what is the matter now;" the son said "Why here is Old Jones got some oil" - he spoke loud, the father told him not to make such a noise; I said we must take them all three to a place of confinement, and asked old Warner which was the best place - he said we had better go to Bow-street at once.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you found the oil in the cellar, had the father said there was no oil - A. Yes; while he was rubbing his eyes on the bed, he said he had no oil, and the son denied there being any in the place. We took them to Bow-street, and left the cans of oil next door at the butcher's; they both said they knew nothing of Jones. We fetched the oil and went to Cockspur-street, saw Mr. Edensor, told him I must take his man Coleby, which I did; I did not tell him what I took him for, he never asked what charge I had against him, or what I was going to do with him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you learn where the Warners carried on business - A. Yes, under the Adelphi. I went there the same morning between eleven and twelve o'clock, and found between 400 and 500 gallons of oil, and four immensely large empty cans - three of them had the name of Dare on them at full length. The prosecutor claimed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Are you a parish officer - A. I am an extra City officer. Sheppard employed me to assist him - I have been an officer sixteen years. I saw Mr. Slark on Monday, and Coleby also, he was pointed out to me as Mr. Slark's servant, that I should know him again; Sheppard said that was Mr. Slark's servant, and we must watch him - I know nothing about Baker. I cannot say whether Coleby saw me; it was a light morning; Sheppard was with me - he might have seen us both. I do not know whether Sheppard hid himself, I saw him come from near the hoard - I saw Coleby let in at the back door, and come out in front, he had an oil can in his hand when he entered the house - I did not notice his dress. I never said any thing about his jacket, I knew by his dress on Friday, that the same man had come on Monday, that is the only way I have mentioned his dress - I swear to him by his face. When we returned from Greek-street, I went into the shop and took him; I believe he then had something of a smock frock on - there was another young man behind the counter; I did not particularly notice him. I searched Coleby's lodging, and found a quart oil can, marked Dare.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you the officer that wanted his wife to give you drink - A. No, she offered to send for some; I did not want to alarm her - I said I only wanted to see if there was any cans, as some were lost - I wanted to look in a cupboard, she asked what I wanted; I said I was looking for the gin bottle. On my oath I did not ask her to send for liquor.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRINSEP. Q. When Coleby turned the corner by Spring-gardens, was he alone - A.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240052"/>Yes. Jones had a blue jacket and apron on, like a lamplighter.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you say you spied a door open, you mean you saw it open - A. Yes. I went into the house in less than two minutes - Warner stood a yard or a yard and a half from Jones, they were abreast, I looked through a key hole, and saw there was a stay shop there. The moment I entered the passage I seized and handcuffed Jones - Warner said he did not know whether Jones lodged there or not.</p>
               <p>Q. For what you know old Warner was in bed and asleep then - A. I followed the mother up, and found him up and dressing, he had his breeches on, I was not in the house two minutes before I went up - nobody claimed the oil found in the house. I have not paid any money towards this prosecution.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you given any money towards it - A. The boy Buchanan said just now, that he was hungry - I gave him sixpence to buy some pudding, he returned me four pence.</p>

            . I am errand boy to a butcher, next door to Warner's. On the 18th of September, I saw Jones at Warner's, when the officers came - I had seen him go there two or three times a week, for ten weeks before; it was always from twenty minutes to half-past six o'clock in the morning, two men used to come, and bring cans with them - I have seen him come on Saturday afternoon, and receive money. I have seen Warner, sen., and the servant girl, pay it into his hands. On the 18th, I saw the officers go into the house - I stood at the door. Jones brought one can, and another man brought another, which he gave him, and run away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PRINSEP. Q. What is Jones - A. I do not know, I only know him by bringing oil; from his dress I suppose him to be a lamplighter - he came on Saturday for money, and sometimes the other man came; Warner did not appear to have any business.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. When you say he brought oil, you mean cans - A. I have seen the girl empty the cans, in the middle of the day; I could not see what was in them when they were brought. I have seen her pay him money, and have seen her master pay him money in her presence.</p>
               <p>Q. When you were going to Bow-street did you say to her</p>
               <p>"I shall make haste and get my work done. I shall be there at one o'clock, and speak a d - d good word for your master, and will do for him" - A. I never said any thing of the sort.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came back did you say, "Well I am come home, he is found guilty, I have done for him" - A. No; I said no such words; nor did I ever say to any body "I'll be d - d if I don't go and give evidence, as it will prove a prime thing for me."</p>
               <p>MR. EDENSOR. The cans are our's, and one is that I marked T. E.; the other has "Dare," on it; the prosecutor succeeded him in the business. The oil in the can which I marked, is spermaceti, which is 5 s. 6 d. a gallon; lamplighters do not use sperm, but common oil, at 3 s. a gallon. The cans found at the Adelphi are also marked Dare - we bought all his stock. I know no other oil dealer of his name.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Can you say the three cans found at the Adelphi were ever in Mr. Slark's possession - A. No; I have lived eight years with him; he never lit the Opera House. I do not know whether Dare ever did.</p>
               <p>MR. SLARK. I succeeded my father in the business - he bought it of Mr. Dare. I tasted both the oils, it is sperm, and the same sort as that in my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. How long ago did your father buy the business - A. Above thirty years. I do not know that Mr. Taylor of the Opera House, bought oil at the house. We occasionally send it out by the porters, who take a full can and bring back an empty one. They are generally bought when they first go out, and changed from time to time.</p>
               <p>COLEBY'S Defence. I know nothing of it.</p>
               <p>JONES'S Defence. I found it under the Piazza. I frequently worked for Warner, and left it there to find an owner for it.</p>
               <p>WARNER, JUN. put in a written defence, which had been intended as a joint defence for himself and father, but the Court thought the evidence not strong enough to call on the father for a defence. It stated, that the three cans found at the Adelphi were not the prosecutor's, Warner, sen. having had them in constant use in his business as a lamplighter for ten years. That he lit the Opera House, and several Theatres in the metropolis; that Warner's, sen. brother occasionally called before any of the family were up, and on this morning the bell rang, and the mother called her son to let his uncle in, he immediately went and opened the door, and Jones, whom they then employed as a lamplighter, came in, followed by the officers, they could not tell what induced him to bring the oil, as it was entirely without their knowledge; that many years ago Mr. Glossop provided oil for the Opera House, and Dare carried on business in Cockspur-street, and he had the oil from Dare for the Opera House; that Warner succeeded Glossop, and as to their denying all knowledge of Jones, he understood the officer to ask, What do you know of this business? and his answer was, "I know nothing of it." The defence then went on to state, that Warner, sen. had lived in repute for twenty-five years, and would not forfeit a good character for such a trifle.</p>

            . I am brother to Warner, sen., he lived in Greek-street. I am a lamplighter, and live at No. 7, Vere-street. I was in the habit of going to his house from half-past six to seven o'clock in the morning. I have worked for him these two years; I used to ring at the bell, the lad sometimes let me in. At times I used to take a can of oil with me from the Adelphi to go to work with at Sadler's Wells, and to call him up. I used to light the Sans Pareil and Sadler's Wells Theatres. I used to put the oil down at the door till they took it in.</p>
               <p>Q. You used to leave the can at the door - A. Yes. I was afterwards to take it Sadler's Wells Theatre.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Did you carry sperm or common oil - A. Both. We use sperm oil to the patent lamps<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240053"/>at Sadler's Wells Theatre. We buy it at Mr. Enderby's and Mr. Johnson's.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not get it from the Adelphi - A. Yes; it is kept there. I left some at Greek-street, because I could not carry it all.</p>
               <p>- SARSOM. I am a stay-maker, and keep the house in Greek-street, Warner lodged on the first floor. I have seen his brother bring cans of oil there, or something. On the morning he was taken I heard a noise in the passage, they knocked at my door and asked if I knew Jones. I let all the house out, I had not noticed a ring at the bell.</p>

            . I am servant to Warner, and have lived four years with him. I never saw Jones at the house, nor ever saw my master pay him any money, nor did I ever pay him any. I know Buchanan - On the day he went to Bow-street, before he went, he said to me "I shall make haste and get my work done, I shall be there at one o'clock, and shall speak a d - d good word for your master, and will do for him;" and when he returned, he said, "Well, I am come home, he is found guilty, I have done for him."</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Has he a wife - A. Yes. I never slept in the house. I used to go there between seven and eight o'clock in the morning. They kept no other servant.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have you known young Warner - A. As long as I can remember, I went to school with him. I was going out for some porter, when the boy said this, it was about ten o'clock on Saturday morning. I had never spoken to him before. I saw him again about twelve o'clock when I was cleaning the steps, he tapped me on the shoulder, and said "I am almost done work, I shall be there at one, and will do for him;" and about four o'clock, he saw me at the street door, and said he was come home, and he was found guilty, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. These were the only times you ever spoke to him - A. Yes. I did not tell his master nor did I go to Bow-street to tell the Magistrate. I told Mr. Sarsom of it the same day, directly, and told my mistress.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you say any thing in answer to him - A. No. When he spoke to me at twelve o'clock, I said I would tell his master.</p>
               <p>- SARSOM. I have heard the girl mention what the butcher's boy had said to her, but I cannot speak to the time.</p>

            . I am a lamplighter, and knew Buchanan by sight. He met me one morning in Church-street, and said he should be a d - d fool if he did not go and give evidence, as it would be a prime thing for him, he said so on the Saturday, between twelve and one o'clock, as he was out going with meat on his shoulder. I had not spoken to him - he forced his conversation on me - he said he should have a crown a day for it.</p>

On the 24th of October, between ten and eleven o'clock in the morning, I went out and gave the key of the door to the prisoner, who lodged with me, and asked him to get the kettle boiled for tea; my watch was in a drawer - I had left the key in it by mistake. I returned between four and five o'clock, he was in the room, and had tea with me. I missed the watch about five o'clock next night, and told him of it next morning; he said he did not take it.</p>

On the 25th of October I took him in charge, and found a crown piece and four shillings on him; I said I thought it was part of what he had sold or pawned the watch for; he said he knew nothing about it. When he got to the watch-house he said he wanted to speak to Mrs. May. I said I must hear what was said; he said he knew where the watch was. I asked where the duplicate was; he said it was where he worked. He took me to a pile of bricks at the end of Newland-street, Kensington, he moved the bricks and took it out.</p>

I said I must have a week's money in advance. He said he had none, but could go to his employer's and get one or two pounds; he wrote his address, I was to go to his master at three o'clock he stopped about the place, I thought it strange; he asked the way to St. Giles's, which I shewed him. He left, and in five minutes I found him sitting in the parlour, my watch then hung over his head. I left him there for two minutes, and then met him at the door, my wife had him by the collar, and said the watch was gone; he denied having it, then gave it me from his pocket.</p>

I found the tea caddy thrown down - I had seen it safe two minutes before in the kitchen window, it could not be seen from the street, no other person but him had been in the kitchen - it could not have fallen off the shelf; I found it about two yards from the window. There is a gate, and a forecourt, before the house.</p>

I knew the instrument again, I had paid 38 l. 17 s. for it; I never heard of it till a week ago; I sent several times after the prisoner, and heard of him through an examination at Union-hall.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. There was no period appointed for him to keep it - A. No; I keep printed circulars, stating, that if instruments are bought and paid for, within six months, no hire will be charged. Gentlemen frequently buy instruments after hiring them. He never gave me notice that he meant to purchase it. I never saw him after he hired it - he called twice within an hour or two on the day he hired it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How long after it was delivered did you cause enquiry to be made - A. Soon after the six months expired. He said nothing about buying it.</p>

            . I lived servant with the prisoner, in Edward-street, Portman-square. I was there a week before I saw the piano-forte, it was put in the back parlour; the house was well furnished, and had the appearance of a gentleman's house; his wife hired me, there was only one child, she is seven or eight years old. The prisoner slept in the house sometimes; a man servant came about a fortnight after me, he was not in livery, my master gave him a suit of clothes. The instrument remained in the house about five days, and was then sent away; I believe the house belonged to Mr. Beby - a bill was stuck up to let it while I was there, it was taken down very often and put up again, I cannot say if it was taken down when goods were coming in - I stopped six weeks, and then Mrs. Wood told me she did not want me any more - I did not get my wages.</p>

            . I am the owner of the house, No. 22, Edward-street. I engaged the prisoner's wife to take care of the house, and let it for me; I was to pay her 5 s. a week, I live at Enfield. It was to be let ready furnished - I came to town and saw the prisoner there, he told me once he had let it to the Archbishop of Tuam. I once called when the bill was down. I think he was three months there, and left at the end of August. He was in the King's Bench as a prisoner, I knew that in the first instance, but gave his wife leave to take care of the house - I saw the piano-forte there when I called, he told me it was an article which he had when he was a housekeeper, and he had lately redeemed it by paying 15 l. for it, and offered it me for sale. His wife came to my house the latter end of July.</p>
               <p>MR. CHAPPELL. The piano-forte is ours.</p>
               <p>By referring to the writ of Haebeas by which the prisoner was brought from the King's Bench, it appeared he was committed there on the 30th of June, 1819.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It was my full intention to have paid for it, and I can prove I have other property coming to me from Western. I have a gentleman in Court who is willing to enter into contract to pay for it. Mr. James of Western has money of mine, but my accounts are confused - I am willing my wife and myself shall be bound over in any way the Court shall think proper.</p>

I have paid it her and took her receipt.</p>
               <p>MR. ANDREWS. Q. How came you to be an agent - A. Mrs. Wood called me in, to pay the money arising from two houses in Ridinghouse-lane; I went with the mother to get the money from the lawyer's in Gray's Inn - I knew the prisoner three years, and served him with coals when he lived in the New Road; but from the time I paid Mrs.

            . I am Mr. Ingram's housekeeper. I do not know the note. I have often gone for change - I have been to Spicer's a great many times for change. I do not know any person of the name of Thompson besides myself, that comes from Ingram's. Ingram keeps a public-house in Bedfordbury; Hunt was a poor man who came to the house, I have occasionally sent him with a glass of spirits and water into the parlour when I have been in the bar alone - he was not a waiter; he has taken it off<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240058"/>the bar when I have put it there. Spicer always asked me what name he was to put on the notes - I do not remember this particular note.</p>
               <p>Q. How many notes do you think you have carried to Spicer's from the beginning of July - A. More than one, two, or three; I dare say I have carried more than one 10 l. note. I do not recollect, as I have carried so many. Whenever Ingram wanted change, he sent me there, and said, Get change for a 5 l. a 10 l. or whatever note it was, as I cannot read. When he received a note from the gentleman he called me to get it changed at Spicer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Then he received this note from a gentlemen - A. Yes. I should know the gentleman again if I saw him - I gave Ingram the pen and ink to write on it, but what he wrote, I do not know. There were three or four gentleman, they had their reckoning to pay - they had something to eat and drink; I think they came in the morning. I believe they had some cold meat - it was a long time back.</p>
               <p>Q.Was it a year ago - A. I cannot say. Handley and Cooper came to the house afterwards.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When were they there - A. I cannot tell. They fetched me before the Magistrate. I have taken many 10 l. and 5 l. notes to Spicer's.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you within a year, taken more than one - A. Three or four.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Ingram keeps the house - A. Yes. I saw him receive the note from the party; he has taken a wonderful deal of pains, to find them out. A great many notes pass through his hands. I told the Magistrate the same as I tell now.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you tell the Justice that you saw him receive the note - A. I told him as I told you. I cannot swear to the note; I have gone so repeatedly for change.</p>

            . I am an officer of Queen-square. I went to Ingram's house the beginning of September - I told him, I was come to make enquiry about a 10 l. note, which he had sent to be changed at Mr. Spicer's, and asked if he could tell of whom he received it - I said I must know, as the note was a stolen one; he said he did not know whether he could or not, without seeing it - I said he could see it at the Bank; he promised to go, and said he would send us an answer - I told him who I was. Three or four days, or a week elapsed; we went to him, and asked if he could give us any tidings about it - he said No, he could not, that he had been to the Bank, and they laughed at him, and said he came on a fool's errand, and that he had not had a proper account given him which office to go to; I said we gave him the same account as we gave other people who had seen it. I told him to fix a time, and we would go with him - he hesitated some time; I again asked him what day to fix on, he said he did not know what day to fix - I said "Will to-morrow do," he said, "Yes," and at last eleven o'clock was fixed. We went to his house next day, at eleven o'clock, and he was not to be found. Mrs. Thompson was in the bar, and said he was gone out on other business - we left, and told the Magistrate, who issued a summons for him; it was put off until another examination, which was on Saturday, the 20th of September. The depositions of the witnesses were taken in writing, but what the prisoners said was not. Previous to that day, we called on him at his house, and asked if he could give any account of the parties - he said No, he did not know who the parties were, but he had taken it of one Thompson in King-street, and pointed towards King-street, which is near his house. He attended at the office, and said he thought he could find the parties, and was to appear on Monday, the 24th of September, he attended, and the Magistrate asked if he could give any better account - he said No, he had been to No. 20, and 22, King-street, Westminster, and could find no such person as Thompson. The Magistrate committed him to Bridewell - we had a search-warrant, and found a pocket book with a flash note in it at his house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. He pointed to King-street above, and then said it was King-street, Westminster - A. Yes. He was bailed and appears here to day.</p>

            . I was with Cooper, we were always there together - his account is correct. I asked Ingram, why he did not keep his appointment, he said he did not know why he was to interfere in it - it was no business of his. He said at the office, that the name of Thompson on the note, was his writing.</p>
               <p>INGRAM'S Defence. I took the note in business, and called Thompson for a pen and ink - the reckoning I think was four shillings, the man asked for change for a 10 l. note - I had not sufficient, and called Thompson; the gentleman gave me the name of "J. Thompson, No. 22, King-street, Westminster." I sent for change, and gave it him.</p>
               <p>HUNT'S Defence. About six or seven days before the Coronation, three genteel dressed men came into Ingram's, and called for brandy and water. Ingram was not at home, the bell rang, they asked if I knew who would go to Crossley's, at the bottom of Holborn, and buy a small Cheshire cheese, a gentleman said Hunt will do it - they gave me the note; I went and had a bill of the cheese, and gave them the note, and my name and address - I delivered the cheese to the gentlemen, at the Sun, public-house, which Ingram keeps, and in the afternoon a carrier came, and took the cheese. They gave me three shillings for my trouble.</p>

I thought something was going on not right - I waited a moment, and heard the asp of the door wriggle, as if somebody was coming in - in about a moment, the door opened, and a man came walking softly along - I let him pass half across the shop, he appeared to be going very gently into the parlour; I made a dart at him, and collared him, he tried to get from me, but I held him tight on the floor, and sung out for a light; he begged of me to let him get up, I said he should, and in the mean time, my wife came up with a light - I pushed him down and said "What have you come here for, you rascal," he said "I have come to buy a second-hand hat." I said, "You know I don't sell any such thing." I secured him, I am sure the door was shut, and on the latch, it was not left a-jar - his companion ran off when he heard the scuffle in the house - I went to the watch-house with him.</p>

I asked what it was, he answered "Nothing"; I asked him two or three times where he got it, he made no answer; the watchman said he had seen another bundle go before that, I asked what he had done with that one, and where he had sold it; he hesitated some time, and said at Forder's, an old iron shop. I asked what was in it, he did not answer, I said, "Was it the same as this bundle," he said "Yes;" he said he sold it for three halfpence per pound, and that there was not quite so much as in this bundle - I ran over to Forder's, and found him in the shop, and two or three people stood round the door talking about the matter - he refused to let me search, as I had no warrant; I went and brought the prisoner over there, and by that time Forder was gone - I examined the scale and counter, there was dust on them similar to what came from these plates; they are coffin-plates, and are dated 1817, 1798, and 1808; there are a great number of them. On the following Thursday, I went into the vault of the church, and in the first vault, I found eleven inscription plates taken off the coffins, three appeared distinctly to be forced off - In another vault, a great many were gone; Messrs.

I ran up Park-street, and saw the prisoner turn the corner, running at full speed, I cried Stop thief! - he was stopped - I collared him and brought him back.</p>

On the 11th of September, in the morning, the prisoner came to buy a horse of me, I asked him three guineas and a half for it - he offered me three guineas - I refused - he then wanted me trust him till Sunday with it, which I also refused; he said he had a good cart to sell, or he would leave it my hands until he paid me. I went to look at it in Red Cow-lane, and brought it home, we afterwards agreed to change the horse for the cart; and as soon as he got the horse he took it to the horse-boiler's to sell it; the horse-boiler stopped it - he came to me to say I sold it to him. I went and said he bought it of me for a cart; the boiler said he supposed the cart was stolen, and detained the horse while I enquired about it, and when I got home Moxley was looking at the cart. Two or three days after I found the prisoner, and had him secured; he escaped while I fetched an officer.</p>

            . On the morning of the 23d of September, about a quarter past one o'clock, I saw the prisoners coming towards me, when they saw me they crossed over on the other side, I saw one had something carrying, and I followed them into Queen-street - I stopped them and asked what they had got? Wilson had the bundle - he said it was his own property. I said he must go to the watch-house; he said he was only a short distance from his own place and would go home. I called another watchman, who took him. He had a saddle, four bridles, and a horse-cloth.</p>

            . I am a watchman. When the prisoners were brought to the watch-house I asked who the property belonged to. Wilson said it was his own, and that he brought it from one of the principal coach offices in Oxford-street. Brown said, "No, we have brought it from Piccadilly," and that he lodged with Wilson in Little Queen-street.</p>

I was on duty at Execution Dock; between twelve and one o'clock at night, the prisoners came ashore there, they had a parcel rolled up with a blanket, and pillow, they were sitting on a bench with the bundle; I asked where they were going, they said to Nightingale-lane. One of the waterman afterwards came up, and asked if I knew them. About twenty-five minutes after, Sherwood returned, I saw him go down to the water side, and asked him where his bed was, and where his brother was, as he had said Frank was his brother-in-law, he said the watchman had stopped, and taken him to the watch-house - I asked why they did not take him, he said, they said they would not take him, because he had not got the bed. I took him to the watch-house.</p>

            . I am patrol of Whitechapel. I met the prisoner about seven o'clock on Sunday night, the 28th of October, going down Whitechapel-road, he slipped by me - I stopped him, he was carrying a sack. I asked what he had there; he said he did not know, but that a man had just given it him by Mile End turnpike. I found it contained thirty-two planes. I said "Why these are planes;" he said "Yes, they are," and that he did not know the man, nor where he was going to take them. I took him. This was about a mile and a half from Mr. Warren's.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. What property was she entrusted with - A. All our wearing apparel and the children's, and articles of plate. The lodgings were left in her care while we went to Paris. I charged another servant with robbing me, they both slept together; her boxes were searched before the prisoner's; the officer opened them with keys which they both produced. While the officers was searching the other woman, the prisoner went down to the privy, we did not suspect her till then.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she told that she might go about her business if she said nothing about the money you had in your hands - A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she say I wish much to go out of such a master's house - A. No. About two years after she came into my service she gave me 20 l. to put in the Saving Bank. She never said she put the property into her box for safety.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q. At whose suggestion did you charge the other servant with the robbery - A. I accused her because she was only a short time with us, and we had great confidence in the prisoner. She gave up her keys very reluctantly, our suspicion arose from her going to the privy. She at first gave me her money to take care of, I explained to her about the Saving Bank, and put it there for her. I refused to hold it.</p>

I there found several articles of mine; a silk shawl, some lace, a child's coral necklace, a garnet ring of mine, a child's frock and trowsers, and two or three napkins. Her box was not the place for the childrens' clothes - I had not given her the things. She left the room at the time of the search, she knew the charge against the other servant, and was in and out of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240063"/>the room during the search of the other servant's boxes.

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When the last search was made she was in custody - A. Yes, she gave her keys to the officer. The ring, frock, trowsers, and silk shawl were found at that time. The lace and necklace were found the first time. There were drawers for the children's things. She had complained of missing the necklace before she went to Kentish-town.</p>
               <p>MR. DOWLING. Q. How many children had you at Kentish-town - A. Four. She had enquired about the necklace. The lace was given her to sew on a child's cap, she said nine or ten weeks ago, that some one had taken it out of the drawer, and laid it to the landlady's daughter.</p>

I asked her on Sunday morning for her keys; she very reluctantly gave me the key of a drawer which contained the keys of her boxes. I went to Kentish-town, and found the keys in the drawer where she said they were. I found four keys there. I searched her boxes in Mr. and Mrs. Lewis's presence, and found a piece of lace, a necklace, and a ring; and in another box I found eight sovereigns and a tobacco box, a 5 l. note, a guinea, a garnet ring, two pair of stockings, a frock, another necklace, a pair of gloves, three napkins, a lace cap, and a shawl.

            . I keep the house at Kentish-town. I was present at the search, and saw Stone find the things.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>MRS. LEWIS re-examined. Q. Was it not her duty to send the things to the washerwoman - A. Yes; she was not present when the garnet ring was found.</p>
               <p>MR. LEWIS. The garnet ring was missing two years ago. I asked her about it and she said it must have fallen down a crevice.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My mistress gave me the lace to trim a child's cap, it was taken out of the drawer by some means; I had lost 3 s. 6 d. before that. Mrs. White's servant said she would examine Miss White's drawer, and see if she could find it. The shawl I washed before I went into the country. We knew nothing about going away till Sunday night, and went on Monday, and in packing up, my things got mixed with the childrens. The coral, necklace was my own years before I knew Mrs. Lewis, and the ring and broach were given me by a friend who is dead, two pair of silk stockings are mine, and a pair of pink gloves my mistress gave me. On Saturday night my master asked if I had seen the sovereigns; I said No, he said he had lost two and knew them by a mark. I shewed him my eight, he was satisfied they were not his. After the constable came I never left the room.</p>
               <p>MRS. LEWIS. The garnet ring was made for me, I had it two years. I never gave her the shawl or any thing.</p>

On the 9th of September, about one o'clock in the morning, I was locked out of my lodging, and walked the streets till about five o'clock in the morning; my landlady was ill, and I did not like to disturb her. I was walking up George-street, St. Giles's, between five and six o'clock, and a man shoved me off the pavement into the street, he was behind me; I asked why he did so, and he immediately struck me a violent blow over the eye, and knocked me down - I got up and wanted to defend myself; I fell under him on his striking me a second time. The prisoner and another man then came up and supported me, as though they were my friends. I asked them, for their civility in parting us, to come to the Two Brewers, public-house, and I would give them half-a-gallon of beer. I told them I had been locked out of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182110240064"/>lodging, and was drowsy; we went to the public-house, and had two pots of beer, the prisoner said I could go to his house, which was a small distance off, and lay down a little to rest - I went with him to the house, and saw a woman; he ordered her to get a bed ready, and he would have breakfast ready by the time I awoke. The two men stood up, and took off my coat, I put it on a chair and my hat and shoes at the foot of the bed - I then laid down with the rest of my things on; only the two men and the woman were in the room. In about an hour and a half, I found Sullivan (the other man) at my left hand waistcoat pocket, which I had on; I asked why he did so, he said he was only putting the clothes on me - I do not know whether the prisoner was then there. When I got up I missed my coat, hat, and shoes, I found the slider of my watch on the bed, the watch was taken from my fob. I gave the alarm. The prisoner was taken afterwards - I have found none of the property.</p>

I went to the Magistrates, but they would not give me a warrant till one o'clock and I was obliged to leave at half-past ten o'clock, for London. I apprehended Harding on Saturday, the 13th of October, and going along he said we could have made it up, without all this work - I said if he would give me the watch and seals, I would forgive him, and he might keep the money, and I would give him a 1 l. note besides - he denied having it, but said he knew who had; a woman who he called his wife, brought it to me on the Monday morning.</p>

I have only got the watch - I never saw his wife in his presence, she said she was his wife, and he said "My wife will make all good."

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. There is no mark on it - A. No; nor any of my work on it. It is an uncommon pattern; the prisoner boarded at the house, my husband does not live with me. Mrs. Stevens keeps a boarding-house for ladies, a single woman lodged there besides us - I do not know that the prisoner was distressed.</p>
               <p>MRS. STEVENS. I know this to be Mrs. Thorn's shawl, I could tell it from a thousand. The prisoner paid me one guinea per week for the first six months; somebody hired it for her, she was afterwards left destitute and quite forlorn - I did what I could for her, I did not know where she went on leaving me.</p>

            . I am an officer. In consequence of information, last Saturday morning, I watched the prisoner and two other men; Patrick was with me; I first saw them about eight o'clock, and about nine, I saw the prisoner go down Whitecross-street alone, with a tub on his head; he went into a house in Bullock-alley, I followed him in, and asked what he had brought into the house that morning; he said there was nothing brought in; I asked him if something had not been brought in a wheelbarrow, which he denied. I searched the house, and found this pig, he said he had it of his brother, and afterwards he said he bought it in Smithfield for 28 s. While I was questioning him, another man came in with an iron pot in his hand; I took him into custody, he was one of those I had seen with him that morning; I also took the prisoner - the prosecutor claimed the pig, it was alive. I had heard it was taken in in a wheelbarrow.</p>

I was on the look out on Sunday morning, the 16th of September, between five and six o'clock, with Charlesworth, and met the prisoner coming down White Lion-street with a basket on his back covered with parsley; I asked what he had in his basket, he said "Parsley" - my partner found thirteen banks of hemp under it; he at last said he found it; I found he lived in the rope-walk, White Conduit-fields.</p>

I went up and asked who he was; he said "It is me;" I said I insist upon knowing what you have under your arm. He made no answer. It was the prisoner who was my servant. I immediately called for a light, which was brought. I insisted on knowing what he had, he pointed down and said, "That is it;" it was the skin which he had under his arm, it then laid at his feet, he had brought it from the workshop. I gave him in charge, went to his lodging, and found one skin, some handles, and other things.</p>
