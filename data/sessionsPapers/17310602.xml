             depos'd, That the Prisoner and his Master Mr. Farrington came about a Quarter of a Year ago to her between 9 and 10 o'Clock at Night to the Turn-pike-House, her Master being in Bed, and she being lighting a Fire in the Turn-pike-House, that they said to her, Mr. Edgerly has gotten a new Maid, and Mr. Farrington said, ay! and he has got my Business too; that Farrington said, if you will do one Thing for me, I will give you some Money, that she ask'd, what that was? He answer'd, kill your Master's Fowls. She ask'd how? They said, they would bring her a thing to do it with, and the next Night they brought her a Stick with a Wier ty'd to the End of it, telling her, she must put it up the Bodies of the Fowls, and it would draw their Guts out. That the next Night they came again, and ask'd her, if she had kill'd any? And she told them she had kill'd two; that they came again the next Night, and Mr. Frame ask'd her to do one thing more, and that was to set Fire to her Master's House, and that she being unwilling, Farrington said, D - n you, if you will nor, some Body else shall, and that the House was set on Fire 2 Nights after. That the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173106020015"/> second Time it was set on Fire, she seeing the Prisoner setting Fire, to it, he jump'd down, and said to her, D - n you, you have frightned me, and if you do not tell me, if they are all still, I have got a Knife, and I will kill you this Minute; that she told him they were all a Dancing, and this was an Hour before Day.</p>
               <p>This Evidence being ask'd by the Court, Why she did not discover this till so long time after? (which, as she said, was about three Weeks since she discover'd it) she answer'd, because she was afraid of her Life; but not being easy in her Mind, without discovering it, she did declare it; she added, that after the Prisoner had jump'd down, he shew'd her a Paper, Touch-Wood and Tinder-Box, that this was about an Hour before Day, and that about an Hour after it was Day, he was behind the new Chimney, and he shew'd a Pipe and Touch-Wood, and told her, that it would lie 3 or 4 Hours before it kindled; that he lighted the Touch-Wood, and put it under the Thatch, and that afterwards it was all on a Blaze, and that he came the third Time, and was behind the new Chimney, and she saw him light the Touch-Wood with his Pipe, and put it under the Thatch; that her Mistress sending up the Boy to take down the Straw that was about, he cry'd Fire.</p>

             has lately prepared two Anti-Scorburick Medicines, being Pills and a Spirit, which excel any Thing yet offered to the Publick, with a Purge given at proper Times with it: It expels the numerous<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173106020017"/> Trains of Scorbutic Symptoms; and as the Hypochondriac and Hysteric Illnesses have their Source from the Scurvy it relieves them; it alters and changes all the Juices in the human Body, thins the Lentor, viz. that sizy , viscid, coagulated Part of the Blood, which obstructs the Capillary Vessels, and is the Cause of Chilness in the extream Parts, as well as Heat in Hypochondriac and Hysteric Paroxysms, renovates the Blood, restores decay'd Nature, chears the Heart, revivers the Spirits, and opens Obstructions of the Viscera, gives Rest to weary , tired and worn out Bodies, it invigorates and inkindles again the almost extinguish'd natural innate Heat, making the Vital Flame to burn clear, removing Weaknesses and Indispositions, and restoring the Pristine Health.</p>
               <p>The Symptoms are cutaneous Eruptions, as red, yellow or black Spots upon the Arms and Legs, as small as Flea-bites, sometimes as large as a Crown-Piece, and sometimes the Limbs are beset with rough scaly Swellings, oftentimes there is an itching of the Skin, which is frequently taken for what is vulgarly call'd the Itch.</p>
               <p>The Scurvy perverts the Lympha, and is a mortal Enemy to the nervous System; for Scorbutick Persons are troubled with Weariness, Weakness, Sense of Weight, and a dull obscure Pain in the Limbs, the Appetite is either too stimulating or too languid, the Gums are liable to Excrescences, Swellings and Ulcers, and when rubb'd void either a saltish Blood or serous Humour, the Teeth are loose and corroded, the Mouth has a Stench; the Spittle is very salt and sometimes acid, they are likewise affected with nocturnal Sweats, difficulty of Breathing, wandering Pains, a fat Skin is found sometimes swimming on the Top of the Urine; but all these Symptoms are rarely found in the same Person.</p>

               <p>An ADDRESS to the GENTLEMEN,</p>
               <p>By Dr. GREGORIUS,</p>
               <p>(Noted for his Skill in Surgery and Anatomy, as well as Physick and Chymistry;)</p>
               <p>WHO having observ'd the frequent Advertisements in the News Papers, of one and another single Medicine, said to cure all sorts of Gleets, and Seminal Weaknesses, which their Authors consound together, as if there were no Difference between<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173106020018"/> them, has been prevail'd upon, by his Friends, in this publick Manner, to inform, and undeceive those who have unwarily been brought into either, (or both together, as it sometimes happens) of these perplexing, draining Imbecilities.</p>
               <p>That where the Gleeting is only from a Laxity of the Glands in the Urethra, what leaks and drills away insensibly from them, through the Urinary Passage, and spots or smears the Linen, though it be yellowish, yet being without Pain, or any ill-condition'd Disorder, is no more than Mucus, and must be cured one Way.</p>
               <p>And where it is a Seminal Weakness, that which slips away involuntarily, though it be thin, watery, and unelaborate, either by itself, in the Day-time, or a Nights too frequently , or profusely in the Sleep, or with the Urine, or upon Stool, whether from an Acrimony, or Depravity of the Juices, or by over-straining the Spermatick Vessels, or both, is Seed, and is to be remedied another way, in as much, as that Medicine which will cure the one, will not cure the other, and (vice versa) as every Practitioner that known the Nature, Make, and different Situation of the Parts ministring to Generation, will all ow; and that for want of this due Distinction, and right Application, it is, that so many People are disappointed of Cure; and by continuance of the Gleetings, are drain'd, as they are, into Impotencies, or Infertilities, which as it hinders their marrying, gives 'em great Anxiety, and the more, when attended, as in some, with Pain and Weakness in the Back and Reins; or, as in others, with Difficulty, or Dribblings of the Urine in, or after making it, which at length comes away either foul, sharp, slimy, or of an ill Smell.</p>
               <p>As this is so in Fact, and the Dr. Well known to have experienc'd, in numberless Instances, the noble and never-failing Effects of two particular Balsamick Electuaries, which he spared no Pains or Expence to find out, the one to restrain the Mucus, and the other the involuntary shedding of the Seed, by their respectively branching up the Fibres, and restoring the Tone and Springiness of the relaxed Glands and Seminals, invigorating the Genitals, and fertilizing the Seed, was also perswaded to recommend their Use, that those, who, for a long while together, had tried other Medicines for the same Weaknesses, and by their not succeeding, concluding themselves incurable, might be convinc'd by their speedy Amendment and Recovery by these that it was not the Incurability of their Malady , but the wrong Method they had been in for Cure.</p>
               <p>But yet in either of the said two Weaknesses, or where it happens that they are complicated, and have proceeded, either from Self-abuses, excessive, or over-straining Coltions , or from over Purgations in Venereal Cures, or any other Cause, as a Flux of Humours generally falls down and settles upon all weakened Parts, rendring them still the weaker, and these tender nervous Parts more especially. The first Step to be taken in order to make way for a regular and substantial Cure, (and without which it is not to be accomplished) must, in a peculiar Manner, be to correct, and gently divert those Humours; and the only Medicine he could ever reply upon to do this effectually, that is, to overcome the Cause, and introduce the Cure of the most difficult of these Weaknesses, (even where the Vessels had been obstructed, Manhood greatly enfeebled, and in some, well high extinct, or at least not able to touch a Woman, but ad primum labiorum contactum, semen emittunt;) has been his Preparing Pills, of which when the Patient has taken only three Doses, at due Distances he is to begin (and not before) with one or t'other (or both together, as the Case may chance to be) of the said two Electuaries, which how to distinguish in, and how to proceed with, the printed Directions, wrap'd up with the Pills, do so plainly shew, that no Persons, even of the meanest Capacities, can be at any Loss to understand them; but will by their observing the easy Rules therein laid down, have their Blood and whole Body well cleans'd and purified, the debilated Parts strengthened, and by Degrees, compleatly, and lastingly invigorated and restored, so as to be enabled quickly, and safely to Marry, without the least Need of any further, or other Advice or Medicine.</p>
               <p>They are to be had, Price 7 s. 6 d. the Box, sealed up, ready to be delivered to any Messenger, upon only asking for, a Box of Pills, at Mr. Payne's, a Bookseller, at the Crown, facing the Chapter Coffee-House, in Pater noster-Row.</p>
               <p>Note, The said Electuaries, viz. Number 1, for Gleets, and Numb. 2. for Seminal and Genital Weaknesses, are to be had there also, Price 7 s. 6 d. each Pot, and are likewise sealed up, and to be asked for by Electuary Number 1, or Electuary Number 2.</p>
