I am a hackney carriage driver, No. 5397—on Saturday, April 12th, about 10 p.m., I was sitting on my cab outside the Grosvenor Hotel and opposite the Victoria public-house, I saw the prosecutor rolling in the road with three others—he was very drunk—McCarthy picked him up, took him round the corner, and came back towards the station—I knew McCarthy well—I did not see him come out of the public-house with the others—I did not see O'Shaughnessy there, there was a man similar to him, but I can swear he was not there—the man who was there was not so tall as O'Shaughnessy.</p>

I am a decorator, of South Lambeth—on April 12th, about 9.45, I was in Buckingham Palace Road—I saw the prisoners come out of a public-house with the prosecutor and another man—they went into the middle of the road—I did not know any of them—they all fell to the ground—I went up and got hold of O'Shaughnessy—he slipped behind a cab and got away—I picked up the prosecutor and assisted him to his feet—I then went towards Victoria to see if I could see a constable—I saw McCarthy hold the prosecutor down by his shoulders—they all ran away, and I saw some silver in McCarthy's hand—I was among them in the middle of the road—both the prosecutor's pockets were turned inside out.—I went to Victoria Railway Station to call a policeman, and as I was returning with one past the Grosvenor Hotel, I saw the prosecutor running as well as he could and McCarthy running after him—I said to the constable. "That is the man," and he caught him—that was about a minute after I had seen him—McCarthy was on the ground with the prosecutor, and O'Shaughnessy tore his coat—I do not agree with the cabman—the prosecutor said to the constable, "That man has <hi rend="italic">done</hi> me for over thirty <hi rend="italic">bob.</hi>"</p>

I am a barmaid at a public-house in Tottenham—on April 10th I had been out, and as I was returning home I met the prose<lb/>cutor—he and I and another man walked along the road together—while we stood at the corner three men passed us—I could not identify them—I know them now—they passed us and said something to the prosecutor-then one of them turned back and struck the prosecutor with his fist—I saw a second blow, and the prosecutor was knocked into the road—I did not see anything more.</p>

Thacker—we all went to the Gate House, Stamford Hill, and saw Foster and Sheldrake standing outside—Foster said to the prosecutor, "You are not going to charge us, are you, George?"—he said, "I shall"—he asked Foster where the other man was—he said, "I have seen no other man with us to-night"—the prosecutor went inside the public-house and said, "There he is talking to a woman"—Whitworth could hear what he said—I took the prisoners into custody—on the way to the station I saw a stick poking out of Whitworth's pocket—he said, "You b----well are not going to take that"—I took it from him—I searched Sheldrake—I found nothing on him—Foster had 2d. on him—I arrested Whitworth 15 or 20 minutes after the prosecutor was robbed—there were other people in the bar—I do not know if they were his friends.</p>

I am foreman to George Attenborough and Sons, 193, Fleet Street, pawnbrokers—on April 14-th, between 11 and 12 a.m., the prisoner came into the shop—he was very excitable—I gathered from what he said that he had lost the ticket of a pledge—I told him in English that he would have to make a declaration before a Magistrate, and he went away—about 3 p.m. he came back—I was writing at the counter—he came facing me and brought a bronze—as he had been before and was rather a nuisance I motioned him to take it away—he struck me in the face to the bone with this dagger—the police were sent for and he was given in custody—I have known him nearly twenty years as a customer and seeing him about.</p>

I examined Holden—he was suffering from a severe contusion on his left temple and eye, caused by a blow from the fist or something—there was an incised wound an inch long to the bone where the scar is now—there was a slight wound on the back of his head—his left ear was much swollen, and there was an incised wound under it, about an inch long, passing upwards and inwards, through the cartilage of the ear, which would bleed freely, and there were two slight incised wounds on his right ear from cuts—a pocket knife would do it—the third finger on his left hand was severely lacerated exposing the bone on both sides, and torn away probably in getting the finger out of the mouth—he was very exhausted—he will not be fit for duty for another fortnight or three weeks.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a hosier of Station Parade, Hampstead. On March 14th the prisoner called and asked me for some circulars that I had issued for business purposes, as he said he wished to get up a descrip<lb/>tive article to put in the <hi rend="italic">St. James' Review</hi>, which had a circulation of 2,000 in the district. He brought a proof of the article next day and read it to me, and I approved of it. He then said it was usual to take 100 copies of the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> on approval of the article, and I gave him a signed order for 100 copies; he asked me for half the cost, £1 5s., which I also gave him, believing his statements to be true. The order was to include the article on my business at 6d. per copy. The address which he gave of the paper was 406, Mansion House Chambers, E.G. Having heard nothing more of the prisoner up to the April 7th, I wrote to St. James' Press, Mansion House Chambers, and the letter was returned through the post marked "Gone away."On April 7th I went to that address and was told that the prisoner had left there about the middle of March, and that letters coming there for him were forwarded to Wood Green. I then went to his house at 3, Granville Gardens, Wood Green, the prisoner opened the door and I said, "You are Mr. Charles Douglas. "He said, "No, he is not in, I am Mr. George Douglas. "He admitted that he had been in Hampstead on March 14th, and I again taxed him with being Charles Douglas and as having received money from me for the <hi rend="italic">St. James' Review</hi>, but he still denied his identity. At the time I gave the order he said nothing about my not receiving them until he had obtained 2,000' subscribers. He promised to deliver them the first week in April.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">The Deposition of Daniel Grady read.</hi> "I live at 87, Malvern Road, Willesden. Unfortunately she is not my wife, I am not married to her. I met the female prisoner about one o'clock yesterday afternoon outside the Chippenham public-house, at the corner of Malvern Road. I bought the food that was wanted for the house, and took some clothes out of pledge. I had a few drinks at different public-houses. The prisoner had one with me. I went home about four o'clock in the afternoon, and came out about five o'clock. I was sober then. I then went and had a drink at the Cambridge public-house with a young man I work with. I do not know his name, and then went with him to the Shakespeare and had another drink. I went for a walk up to the High Read, Kilburn, and got home between ten and eleven o'clock alone. The prisoner was at home in bed. I was sober then. I pulled my coat and vest off and lay on the top of the bed. I do not think the prisoner was sober, or she would not have done what she did, the prisoner got out of bed and was going to strike me with the tongs on the top of the head. I tried to defend myself by pushing her off. She picked up the lamp which was standing on the table she threw it at me and covered me with flames. I don't know exactly what time, but I think it was between half-past three and four in the morning. I tried to put the flames out myself, but I could not, so I ran down the stairs, someone in the house, whose name I do not know, put a piece of carpet round me and put it out. This was done by a man and woman, both strangers, the police came after that, and they brought me straight here to the hospital, all through the day there had been a little quarrelling between me and the prisoner, nothing very much, we have often previously quarrelled, I am not exactly a teetotaller, I work hard, I made fifty-two hours last week as a plasterer, and my wages amounted to £2 5s. 10d. I gave the prisoner 25s. yesterday, besides money during the week, about one shilling a day." <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by the Prisoner.</hi> "The prisoner got my suit of clothes out of pawn for 10s. 2d., I don't remember whether I was in the Chippen<lb/>ham at ten minutes to twelve last night, I did get a can of beer from there, a pint and a half. I drank some and took some home, I was at home before ten o'clock. I got on the bed without waking the prisoner. I did not take the lamp up and throw it at the prisoner, and then she threw it back at me, it's a lie, I am not a terrible drunkard, I do get drunk sometimes, about once a week. I am always jolly with it, but she always upsets me, I suffered six months' imprisonment in America for assaulting my wife, she died whilst I was in prison, she met with an accident not caused by me. I am quite sure I was sober when I went home last night, I did not strike the prisoner outside the Chippenham last night, I never hit the woman at all she hit me."</p>

I there are lots of Jews in London, in fact there are two in the company now"—with that Samuel struck prosecutor, who returned the blow and knocked Samuel to the ground—he got up and struck the prosecutor again—it was Moses who put his arms round the prosecutor—when they let him go the prosecutor went for a policeman—I said to Moses, "Why do not you go away"—he struck me in the face and I fell down senseless—when I came to my watch and chain and a brooch were gone—my friend picked up the watch and chain; I lost my brooch—I had seen both the prisoners two or three times before in Wells Street—they often interfered with us—Samuel did not touch me, it was Moses—the next morning they came to our house and nearly broke the lock off the door by knocking so hard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> When the prisoners came to our house Samuel said he had got somebody else's cap and wanted his own—he was told if he wanted his cap it was at Leman Street Police Station—the row occurred close to a public-house just after closing time—there were not a good many people about—there is a fried fish shop just there, but I do not know Levy as keeping it—I do not know him—I do not know Mr. Murphy—Samuel got the worst of the fight, Moses pinned his arms round the prose<lb/>cutor's waist, and when they let him go he found his watch and chain all right, but said he missed two rings and three sovereigns—both the prisoners went away—when the prosecutor went for a policeman I screamed, and said, "Why don't you go away, we are not interfering with you"—I was then struck and prisoners ran away down a court—I found my watch and chain close to where I was knocked down—I had been with prosecutor a long time—we were not singing, we were humming a coon song—it was not a <hi rend="italic">sheeney coon song.</hi>

                  </hi>. On February 5th I was in the Whippet Club, Adelaide Street, Charing Gross—Devenport and two other men came in, one of them was Thomas Brown—a game of cards was played, and Deven<lb/>port lost £2 or £3—Brown spoke to me, and then handed to me what purported to be a £5 note—I took it to a man named Laws, who changed it—I handed the change to Brown, and he handed at least £1 to Devenport, probably more—I had known Devenport for the better portion of a year—I had only seen Brown on two or three occasions before, and nearly always with Devenport—Brown or Devenport invited me to accompany them—we left the Whippet Club, and went to the Tivoli Restaurant in the Strand, where another note, purporting to be a £5 note, was changed—it was actually handed by a man named Levy, who was with us—we then all four went to a club kept by a man named Bartenshaw in South<lb/>ampton Buildings—from there we went to Mooney's wine shop in Holborn, where another note, purporting to be a £5 note, was changed—Levy was the actual hander of the note also—when Levy changed the notes he took them from at least five others which he had in his hand—we all went outside Mooney's, when the other three hailed a hansom, saying they were going north—they turned up Gray's Inn Road, and I got on the next omnibus—On February 6th I was again at the Whippet Club about 6 p.m.—I saw Mr. Laws there—he made a statement to me, and produced a note which I had handed to him the night before, at least, he said it was the one—I took a note of its serial number, the note number, and the date—I had not looked at it on the 5th, it was given to me doubled up, and I knew it could not be for less than £5—I had not the slightest suspicion with regard to it—I had some further conversation with Laws on the 6th, and during it Parr's Bank was mentioned—we then went to the Bull public-house in Devonshire Street, Bishopsgate Street, where I expected to find Brown, he had been manager there—we did not find him, he had left on the previous Thursday—I knew that Devenport lived at 63, Mark House Avenue, Walthamstow, and that he invariably returned home by a late evening train from Liverpool Street to St. James' Street—that is how I became acquainted with him—Laws and I waited at Liverpool Street Station till 12 a.m. train had gone, then I left Laws and went home to Hoe Street, Walthamstow—next day I went to Devenport's house—I did not find him at home—I met Laws at St. James' Street Station at 11 o'clock—we waited with the object of seeing Devenport, when Ex-Inspector Walter Outram of the City police came along, who I knew—I spoke to him, and we all went into the Coach and Horses—Laws showed the note to Outram, who looked at it—I made a statement to him in reference to it—I went out for a <hi rend="italic">few</hi> minutes, and while I was away the number of the note was given to Outram—an appointment was made that I should meet Outram at 11 a.m. next morning—then Laws and I returned by train to London—that evening at 11 I again attended at Hoe Street Station—I did not see Devenport—I went to his house, and he came downstairs into the front parlour in his</p>

               <p>night clothes—Lawes had written to him the day before, and, I believe, had told him about the note—Devenport said to me, "What does Lawes mean about this note you changed for Tommy Brown?"—I said, "They say the note is a bad one"—he said, "Do you mean it has been stolen?"—I said, "No, it is a bad one altogether"—he said, "I will send a telegram to Tommy Brown to meet us at the Unicorn public-house, Bishopsgate Street, at 2.30 this afternoon, and if you will come back for me we will go up together"—I was not present when the telegram was sent—I went back for him, and we went to Bishopsgate Street by train together—Brown was not at the Unicorn, and we went to the Bird Cage in Columbia Market—we got there about 3 p.m.—I told Devenport that Lawes had said the note had been taken to Parr's Bank, and that the cashier there had been unable to definitely announce it a bad one—on the way from the Unicorn to the Bird Cage he said all of a sudden, "It is a bad one, it is one of a parcel of 100, we are going now to see the man who enabled us to pay for them; Walter Brown has taken 50 out of the 100, and he is sending them to South Africa; the other 50 is a three-handed deal between Walter Brown, <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi> Brown, and myself; we got rid of 17 yesterday; we dropped one at every public-house on the way home from Hurst Park; we never had a single one questioned, and it was like handing out tracts—he said his share was a third in the deal—he said he had not been <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> enough to put a note down himself—I did not know who Walter Brown was—(<hi rend="italic">One of the Jurors was here requested by the Court to leave the box. Another Juror was called, and the Jury being resworn, the witness repeated his former evidence and continued.</hi>)—at the Bird Cage he left me, saying he was going to see Walter Brown—he returned in about two hours with the person he called Walter Brown, and a person whose head was heavily bandaged—in Brown's presence he said to me, "I have been telling Walter Brown that the note cannot be pronounced a bad one by the chief cashier at Parr's big Bank"—and speaking to Brown he said, "I have been telling Fry that we got rid of 17 at Hurst Park yesterday, that we dropped one at every public-house on the way home, that it was just like handing out tracts, and we never had a single one questioned"—he then produced four notes—I handled them—two were undoubtedly good, and two I judged by the initial letter and the serial number to be bad ones—I said of the bad notes, that either of them seemed much better than the one I had changed, which was the fact—Devenport said if the chief cashier could not tell about that one, what about these that were better—he said they invari<lb/>ably carried a good note and a bad one when changing notes, and not more than one bad one at a time—I had made repeated requests for the £5 which Lawes was out of, and an arrangement was made that if I took Lawes to the long bar at Liverpool Street Station, at 7 o'clock, Devenport would return us the £5 on our handing him back the £5 note—he asked me on no account to tell anybody what he had been saying to me—he and I, Walter Brown and the bandaged man then all left together—I left them in the Hackney Road, and went to the Whippet Club—I saw Lawes, and with him about 7 p.m. went to what I believed to be the long bar at Liverpool Street Station—we waited till close upon 8 o'clock, but Devenport did not come—we</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190205050052"/>
               <p>went to the platform where the trains start for Walthamstow, I saw Deven<lb/>port—there was some conversation with regard to the note, and he said, "Give me the note and I will give you the gold"—he was hurrying for his train, and as Lawes was finding the note in his pocket book he was counting the gold into my hand, something was handed to him by Lawes which was believed to be the £5 note—it turned out to be a special contract note—the train started and Devenport went away, and Laws found he had made a mistake with regard to the document—that night I was again at the Whippet Club, and I saw a Mr. Nadel, who carries on a tobacconist's business downstairs, I had some conversation with him in reference to the note and I handed it to him—I saw him again later, and he handed me a small portion of it only, and he made a statement as to what he had done with the rest. In the evening of February 9th, I went to Devenport's house and had a long conversation with him—he had often told me he could not be brought into the business himself, as he was not <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> enough to put down a note himself, I told him that a man like him might give good reasons for putting six or seven down, but that to speak of such numbers as he had been speaking of was perfect madness, and it would be sure to be brought home to him, and that it was perfect madness to take one to a club like the Whippet Club, and I told him that it was not what one would have expected of a person, to place it with his friends, and that if he had such things he had the world for his market, and I could not conceive him doing what he said he had done—I was referring to his having passed a forged note through my hands—I asked him what I was to do, I said, "I am sure to be recognised as being with you, what excuse am I to make," he told me to find a reason, and used a very coarse expression—I told him that to my knowledge he was committing the most serious crime known to the commercial world, and that the law of con<lb/>spiracy would touch him, because I knew what the law of conspiracy was as I had been charged myself—I was charged here with conspiring to obtain money by false pretences, at this Court on November 5th, 1897, and was sentenced to three years' penal servitude—I became free on January 25th, 1900—I became acquainted with Devenport about a year after that—I have only met him two or three times in the club, he was only a mere acquaintance—I told him that the Whippet Club note had been burned, and he declined to believe it—I promised I would get the piece I had seen, and return it to him—I told him it was a good thing it was destroyed, because Lawes within my knowledge had given Outram the number—I do not think I made a bit of impression upon him in dis<lb/>suading him from the course upon which he was set—on leaving the house I went to see Inspector Outram, and made a statement to him—I made an appointment to see him the next day, Monday the 10th, and in con<lb/>sequence of what passed between us, I met Chief Inspector Davidson on the 11th, and made a statement to him—a further appointment for Wednesday the 12th was made at which I was introduced to Inspector Sagar, and we came to an arrangement as to what was to be done in the future—that same evening I was in the Peacock in the Minories, where I saw Devenport, I had arranged to meet him there and return him the piece of the note,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190205050053"/>
               <p>so that he could show his co-partners that it had been destroyed—he said, "You had better get rid of some of these notes"—I said, "Well, I will consider the matter"—he said, "Well, I will see my man and see how many I can let you have"—I said, "If the notes you can sell are up to the specimens you had on the Saturday night, I have no doubt I shall be able to do them"—those were the two he showed me at the Bird Cage—he said they had paid 30s. per note, and the expenses of travelling, the horse and trap and drinks, had averaged less than 5s. per £5 note, and that up to that time they had got rid of twenty-seven out of the fifty, that they had been enabled to pay the expenses to which they had been put but that they were nothing in pocket, and that the money had been paid to Walter Brown—he said he was not inclined to part with any parcel of less than 100, but he did not think he could obtain more than 200, and that 30s. per note was what he was paying for them himself—I told him I would endeavour to find a principal who would go into the business—we then arranged to meet next morning at his house—I then saw Davidson and made a communication to him—on all occasions I made a full and complete communication to the police of what was being done or was intended to be done—when I telephoned to the police I used the name of "Good"—on February 13th I saw Walter Brown at the Bird Gage, I did not speak to him, but I made an appointment with Devenport, who was with him, to meet him at Liverpool Street Station at 6.30 p.m. the same evening, when I told him I was not accompanied by my principal, because I could not find one, but that if he would go on and put it in train I would wait for him till 7.30—he said he had to go and see his man at 7 p.m.—we left the station together, went into the long bar at the Railway Tavern, Liverpool Street—then he went into Ward's, the hosier's, at the corner of Wormwood Street, and bought a pair of gloves, then he looked through the window of Smith's oyster bar in Bishopsgate Street as if he expected to see somebody, and then he jumped on to an Elephant and Castle 'bus going in the direction of London Bridge—at 7.30 I returned to Liverpool Street Station—he came soon afterwards—he said he had seen his man, and had the matter in training, but that he would not de<lb/>finitely order the goods until he had seen my man—he said he thought his man could supply 200 at 30s. each to him—I said I would bring my principal along in the course of next day, Friday—next day I saw Deven<lb/>port at the Peacock when an appointment was made for Saturday, Feb<lb/>ruary 15th—I met him there, and Thomas Brown was also there—Brown made an observation to Devenport, which showed he knew of the business afoot between Devenport and myself—I said, "How is it that Brown knows about this deal, I thought it was between you and myself, and I did not know Brown was to know anything about it?"—Devenport said, "Brown must come into the business, because I have good reason to fear that on my return home to-night I shall be arrested: last Friday at Hurst Park I gave a runner named <hi rend="italic">Ginger</hi> Murray one of the notes, and he took it to a bookmaker named Billy Foots; Foots saw that it was a bad one, and told Ginger Murray to bring me to him, and now it has subsequently got to the knowledge of Detective Walter Scott of the</p>

               <p>City Police, who was on duty there, and Brown will now have to come into the business in case I fall"—Brown said, "I know <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> even better than does Devenport, because he used to use my house"—he probably referred to the Bull public-house—"and if what Devenport fears may happen should occur, I can manage it just as well as he"—I think that was the first time I heard the name of <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> from either of them—I subse<lb/>quently asked who he was—they showed me some samples of notes they had bought to show my man in case he had turned up—there were at least four notes, it may have been five—I looked at them—Brown borrowed an envelope from the landlord of the Peacock and placed the notes into it, the envelope was gummed down, and a cross made on the back, and then Devenport or Brown handed it to the landlord and asked him to take care of it until they called for it next day—the landlord did not know what was in the envelope—we made an arrangement to meet at the Horns at Kennington at 1.30 next day, where I was to take my principal—I went then to Fenchurch Street Station and then home to Leyton, but before doing so I saw Outram, and also made a statement to Davidson—I met Davidson next day at 10.30, and learned that I could have a principal next day, Monday—I then went to the Horns and met Devenport and Brown at 1.30—they drove up in a buggy and Devenport's trotter—I told them I could not get a principal that day, but that they might take my order on his behalf for 200 notes, and we made an appointment for 6 p.m. next day, Monday, at the Ship in Finsbury Pavement—my prin<lb/>cipal was to be charged 50s. per note—as they were leaving Devenport said they would drive direct to their man in the Kennington Road, and get him to cable to Spain and order the notes, and that he would expect them to be in London on the Thursday, and not later than the Friday morning—I gave them an assurance that I should be accompanied by my principal on the Monday—later on Sunday I saw Davidson, and on Monday evening, February 17th, a little after five. I was introduced to my so-called principal, Mr. Sammes, a jeweller of Ilford—he lent his assistance to the police in this matter—I attended at the Ship with Sammes at 6.30—as we approached Devenport crossed the road, and I said to him, "This is my merchant friend, Mr. Sandes"—Devenport said, "Wait a moment"—he went across the road, and appeared to take something from a person standing on the other side of the road—he returned to us and handed me an envelope, and said, "These are the samples, take your man away some<lb/>where where he can look at them on the quiet"—the envelope had a cross on the back of it, and was a similar envelope to that handed to the landlord of the Horns the day before—Sammes and I took a hansom cab and went to Masons Avenue—I stayed in the cab while Sammes went in search of the police, the envelope remaining in my possession—I handed it to David<lb/>son, who came in a short time with Sammes—he went away with the envelope—Sammes rejoined me with the envelope, and we drove back to the Ship—I left Sammes in the cab, and went inside the Ship, where I found Devenport and Brown—I said, to Devenport, "My man is outside"—he came out and Sammes invited him into a cab, and Devenport said to me, "Go and tell Brown to wait at least an hour for me, and I will</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190205050055"/>
               <p>come with you"—I told Brown, and then we all three got into the cab and drove to Finsbury Square—Sammes said to Devenport, "I thought at first you were having a game with me, and these were genuine £5 notes, but they have been submitted to the examination of experts, and I know now they are bad."—Devenport said, "Yes, they are good, but they are not nearly so good as you will find the bulk to be."—Sammes said he was prepared to buy any quantity at the price mentioned by me, 50s., if they were up to the sample—Devenport said he could have certainly about 200, and I would not like to swear, but I rather think he said there were some more, I think 1,500 was mentioned, of which he could get about 200—Sammes said I was his agent in the matter, and he would be glad if Devenport would let me know as early as possible when the business could be carried through. Something was said about two days, but I do not remember now by whom, I think Devenport was to let Sammes know in two days when he could deliver them—by that time it was known that the delivery could not take place before Thursday at the earliest—when we were in the Peacock on Saturday, February 15th, when the four notes were shown to me, I said they looked so much better than the others I had seen, as they were absolutely new while the others had been creased—they were given back afterwards to Devenport by Sammes, but Deven<lb/>port said about them that they had made a mistake in the engraving, and that he had known some years before a Mr. May who had been a member of the Bank of England, and that Mr. May had pointed out that in the good £5 notes there was a white dot in the old English "i," about half way up the "i," and in the "f "in "For the Governor and Company of," the tail of the "f" was left in an incomplete state, but in the bad notes the "f "had been completed and the dot on the "i" was absent—he said he had drawn attention to the fact and that an alteration would be made in the plate—later he said that the original intention had been that the notes should not come out till the Lincoln Handicap, which was on March 17th—and he also said, "But there are some <hi rend="italic">teners</hi> being got ready, which will be ready for Lincoln"—on the Monday night I parted from Devenport with Sammes, and later on I was in communication with Davidson—on Tuesday, February 18th, in consequence of a message I got, I went to the White Bear in King William Street, and about 11.15 a.m. Devenport came in—he beckoned me out, and we went to the Monument Station, opposite which we joined Brown—Devenport said he was going down to see his man at his private house, and we all three went over London Bridge—we went by the electric train to Kennington, and by tram up the Kennington Road—opposite a house in Kennington Road Devenport alighted—Brown and I proceeded a little further and then alighted and went into the Ship, where' within a short time we were rejoined by Devenport—he said that his man was out, but that he had seen his wife and had made an appointment to dine with them that evening at 7.30—we returned to the Peacock and made an appointment to meet next morning—on leaving the Peacock I went and met Outram, and sent him for Davidson—he and Sagar came, and after making arrangements with them I went to Blackfriars Bridge by train, where I waited till Davidson</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190205050056"/>
               <p>and Outram rejoined me—we then all three drove down the Kennington Road and I pointed out to them the house at which Devenport had called, it was No. 189—on Wednesday, the 19th, I saw Devenport at his house—I asked him if he had dined with his friend the night before—he said no, but he had seen him and that we could have all the bulk that were left, about 1,150, but that he was afraid no business could be done because there were several others after them, and his man had put the price up to £2 per note to him—he said, "I have had a letter in which you see he says that we can have the 1,150, but they will be £2 a note "and he handed me a letter in an envelope addressed to himself—I read the letter, and it said what he had told me—I asked him to let me have it to show my principal and tell him the price would be £3 instead of £2 10s.—Deven<lb/>port had said they would be £3 each—when I asked him for the letter he said, "You see there is a postscript which says, 'Please destroy this letter,' so you must let me have it back," and I promised to do so—it was not signed—it had no address upon it, but I recognised the writing as his own—it commenced, "Dear Pal"—I had no doubt that it was Devenport's writing—I was to return it to him a little after six that night at the Tower Bridge Hotel—I showed the letter to Davidson and Sagar, it was at that inter<lb/>view that Devenport told me that <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> Cohen was so angry at his having called at his house in Kennington Road, that he proposed to leave his lodgings there next day, and that he had declined to see Devenport any more in the business, because he heard there was a warrant out for him (<hi rend="italic">Devenport</hi>) for the Hurst Park note, and that in future appointments to complete the business would have to be made between <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> and Brown, and not Devenport, and that <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> had arranged to meet Brown at the Shepherd's Bush Station of the Tube Railway on the following Thursday, when he hoped to be in a position to let Brown know when he would deliver the notes and make arrangements for the delivery, examination, and payment—Brown was to take the place of Devenport—I received the letter back from the police, and kept my appointment at the Tower Bridge Hotel, where I saw Devenport and Brown, I gave the letter to them and it was burned—then another appointment was made for 3 o'clock next day, when I was to meet Devenport in the King Lud, in Ludgate Circus, and I was to take him to see my man whose office was in Imperial Buildings, which is just opposite—I went with Devenport from his house to the Tottenham Court Road Station of the Tube railway, where we arrived at 12.30—Brown arrived about 1.15, after he was supposed to have seen the principal at Shepherd's Bush Station at 12 o'clock—I heard from Brown that <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> had not kept the appointment at Shepherd's Bush, and it was decided we all three should go to <hi rend="italic">I mey's</hi> house at 189, Kenning<lb/>ton Road—Devenport called there afterwards and overtook Brown and myself, who had strolled along together—Devenport told us that the land-lady had said that <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> had left the house, and had gone to Hastings Devenport and Brown then suggested that they should go to <hi rend="italic">I mey's</hi> solicitor, Mr. Kemp, at 143, Holborn Bars—as we were going Devenport thought we were being followed, so we alighted from our omnibus—we were going to Mr. Kemp to get him to telegraph to <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> to make an</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190205050057"/>
               <p>appointment with him—when we alighted we parted for a time, I re<lb/>joined them, and we all got on a 'bus to Chancery Lane, I to keep an appoint<lb/>ment with Sammes, and they to go to Mr. Kemp's office, to try and get an appointment with <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> next morning—I rejoined them at the King Lud, and took Devenport to see Sammes at 30, Imperial Buildings—Sammes said to Devenport, "Fry tells me we can have 1,150, but the price has gone up to £3."Devenport said, "Yes, that is so, there are several others after them, I will tell you what I will do for you, I will split 5s. of my profit and you can have them at £2 15s. "Sammes said, "All right, I will let you know, if you can call back to-morrow, but I am very sorry you have raised the price as I had instructions to complete the deal"—next morning Devenport, Brown, and I went to Mr. Kemp's office—we could get no news of <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi>, and it was arranged we should go to his daughter's, at 6, St. John's Street, Market Place, Finsbury—Brown inquired at the door, Devenport and I remaining a little way off—Brown rejoined us and said the telegram was still lying there—we went to the Peacock, and then Devenport and I went to keep the appointment at Imperial Buildings—we found Sammes there, and he told Devenport that he was instructed to complete the deal for the 1,150 notes at £2 15s. per note, and he showed him several bags of gold which he had—it was hoped the delivery would take place next day, Saturday, but Sammes left the arrangements of any appointments that might be necessary, with me—I returned with Devenport to the Peacock to find Brown, who was told what had passed.—Devenport and I then went to Rossaman Street, Clerkenwell—opposite the business kept by Devenport's sister is the Red Lion—as we passed it I said, "Let us walk over and have a drink"—he said, "I would rather not, because <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi> Brown and I are friends of the landlord, and <hi rend="italic">Tommy</hi> came up with a local ice cream merchant and changed a note over the bar when the landlord was out, and I do not think I will go in there"—about 7 o'clock I returned to the Peacock where I found Brown—I left with him, and as we were walking along Houndsditch he suddenly left me and darted across the road and joined two men—he went away with them—I waited about half an hour, and as he did not return I walked back to the Peacock—I found Devenport there, Brown returned shortly afterwards, he was accompanied by another man, and directly they entered the bar Devenport ejaculated,."It is our man," and jumped up, and the man never got into the door because Devenport and Brown went out with him—the other man was <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> Cohen—I only knew him from seeing him, there is no doubt that it was he—they remained out of the Peacock about fifteen minutes—Devenport came back and said to me, "Come out and see our man"—I went out—he simply said he had not seen me before—I said, "no, I did not think we had met"—he said, "Deven<lb/>port and Brown tell me you have a man who can deal with 1,150, how is it you have a man who can do with such a large number of notes?"—he mentioned no price—then I told him the tale that had been agreed upon by Davidson and myself—I told him that Sammes was acting for a Paris banker who was deficient in his accounts, and was anxious to obtain as many £5 Bank of England notes as he could, at their face value, to</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Continued</hi>). On February 22nd I was with Brown in the Peacock awaiting the arrival of <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi>, who did not come—on Feb<lb/>ruary 23rd I was at Devenport's house, and he told me he might receive a telegram from <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> at any moment—on the 25th I went to Mr. Kemp's office in Holborn to inquire about <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi>—Brown was expected to attend there but did not—I saw Devenport again both on February 27th and 28th, but he could give me no information with regard to the missing <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> Cohen, and I never succeeded in holding any further communication with <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> Cohen—on March 1st I again saw Devenport, and he asked me to work out some prices to compare with some he had made with regard to what 1,150 notes would come to at £2 and £2 15s. per note, and as the result of my calculations I saw him write the last figures on this document (<hi rend="italic">Produced</hi>) "£862 10s."—that would be the difference between £3,162 10s. and £2,300, the proposed cost price, and he then said that he made his figures slightly different—on March 3rd, at midnight, I was with Brown at Liverpool Street Station, and shortly afterwards Wyndham came up—Brown then said to me in Wyndham's hearing, "I have been asking Wyndham whether he could enable us to find <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi>, and he tells me that <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> has gone away, but that he can do more for us than <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> could"—I said to Wyndham, "Is that so?"—he said, "Yes, it is, <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> was never trusted with more than a few notes at a time. Brown tells me that you have a purchaser of 1,150, and I can get as many as you require, if you come with me now I will take you to my man"—I said to Brown, "Let us go"—whilst we were talking Devenport came up, and Brown told him to go away, and said we would overtake him—Devenport walked a way, and I saw no more of him that night—Wyndham, Brown, and myself took the 12.15 a.m. train to Coburn Road Station—on arriving there we turned into the Mile End Road, walking towards the City—Wynd<lb/>ham stopped outside a house which I now know to be Durban House,</p>

               <p>No. 453, Mile End Road—he went inside, and shortly after returned and said, "<hi rend="italic">Alf</hi> is not at home, but I have seen his wife, who knows as much about the business as he does, and she says we can have up to £6,000 worth,—I have made an appointment for him to meet you at the Royal Hotel, Burdett Road, at 10 o'clock to-morrow"—Brown and I left Wyndham, and we drove to Brown's house at Stratford—I then left Brown and went and saw Ex-Inspector Outram first of all, and with him went to Chief Inspector Davidson, arriving there at 4 a.m. on March 4th—at 11 o'clock that morning I went alone to the Royal Hotel, and there met Wyndham—he said, "I have been to my man, but he is in bed, as he did not get home from his club until 8 o'clock this morning, I could not wait for him, as I want to go to the Races, but I have arranged for him to meet you at the Bodega in the Strand at 7.30 this evening, it would be most convenient to his man, as his offices were in the neighbourhood"—at that time I did not know Hurley, nor did I know that he lived at 453, Mile End Road, and had an office at 9, Adam Street, Adelphi—whilst Wyndham was still with me, Brown arrived, and repeated his previous statement to me, and then went off to Gatwick Races—later in the day Brown and I saw Deven<lb/>port at the Peacock, and told him of the appointment for that evening at the Bodega—I suggested keeping the appointment by myself, as if we all went together it might frighten them off the deal—Devenport was very angry, and said that if there was any business to be done he would be the person to do it, or he should see there was none done at all—on arriving at the Bodega at 7.30 we saw Wyndham and a man named <hi rend="italic">Fitzey</hi> Gibbons, whom I had never seen before—after our arrival Wyndham went out and came back in a few minutes and said, "They have arrived," or"They are outside"—Devenport and Wyndham then went out, and returned in half an hour, and then we went towards Daly's Theatre—Wyndham and Devenport kept looking about to see that they were not being followed—I asked Devenport if he had done any thing—he said, "Yes, I think I have fixed the business up—they tried to discourage me, but I have overcome their objections, and I have made an appointment to meet them at 11 o'clock to-morrow morning at the King Lud, and I believe that we shall be able to complete the business by about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, I want you to get your man to his office by 10.45, so that I may have five minutes' conversation with him and satisfy myself as to the arrangements for their delivery, examination, and payment"—we all five went to Daly's Theatre, and on leaving there we went to the bar of the Crown Hotel, Charing Cross Road, where Devenport said to Wyndham, "I thought you said there were too many in this business already, and now you have been and told <hi rend="italic">Fitzey</hi>"—Wyndham waved the objection away by saying, "Oh <hi rend="italic">Fitzey</hi> knows all about the business"—then Wyndham, addressing me, said, "Now, Fry, tell us all about this business, and what it means"—I repeated the tale that we had a man in Paris who was a buyer of 1,150, and Gibbons said, "I don't understand how any man can possibly do with such a quantity, because there is sure to be a <hi rend="italic">row</hi> sooner or later, and what is your man going to say when he is asked where he got them from? besides, these things cannot be examined in a public-house; how do you</p>

               <p>propose to examine them I have heard no scheme that I consider prac<lb/>ticable for their transfer from their present holder to the buyer"—he asked me more than once if I was quite sure my man was all right—Deven<lb/>port said he had made arrangements for their being taken from the cloak-room by myself, that I would take them to the office in Imperial Buildings, where they could be examined quietly, and that the money was to be paid either there or at the Safe Deposit in Queen Victoria Street—£3,000 was said to have been deposited there, but at another interview £1,500 only was mentioned—I mentioned that the weight would be rather heavy, and Devenport said, "You need not bother about that, because I have made all the necessary arrangements for getting the money away"—then Gibbons said to me, "Do you know Davidson?"—I said, "What Davidson do you mean?"—he said, "The Chief Inspector of the City Police"—I said, "I should rather think I do; I know them all, but why do you ask me this question?"—he said, "Well, about half an hour before you turned up, Wyndham ran right into him in the Strand, and we did not like the look of it at all"—we then left the Crown, and whilst walking along Brown said to Devenport, "<hi rend="italic">Fitzey</hi> appears to be putting Wyndham off the deal; if I were you I should let him know a little more fully how you mean to manage the business"—we went into the Gaiety Buffet, and Devenport said he proposed coming up in the morning with his trotter and <hi rend="italic">buggy</hi>, that Brown would bring a portmanteau, and that if he was attempted to be followed driving his trotter nothing could possibly do so except a bicycle, and if that persisted in following him he would be sure to notice it—he said that he had seen my man on three occasions, and that if he were willing to run the risk the others ought to be able to stand upon his assurance—Devenport and I then went on to Liverpool Street Station and took the train to Hoe Street—on the way Devenport told me that when he went out of the Bodega with Wyndham he had seen two men whom he alluded to as the fat man and the lean man, and that he was confident the business would go through, and he asked me again to be sure and have my man there at 10.40 the next morning—I saw Devenport again next morning and we drove up from Walthamstow to the Unicorn, Bishops<lb/>gate, and I told him that Mr. Sammes would be unable to keep his appoint<lb/>ment at 10.45, but would be there at 12.45, and that if the notes were found to be in order the money would be handed over against the cloak ticket room—I then left and Brown who had arrived got into the trap with his portmanteau—as I was leaving Devenport asked me not to arrive at the King Lud until 11.15, as he did not wish me to meet his men—I arrived at the King Lud at that time, and Devenport came there and told me that the business was not progressing at all satisfactorily, that his man had learnt during the night that <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> Cohen had considered the business too dangerous to proceed with, and they were very suspicious of it, and he was afraid that the business would not go through after all—he said, "I have left them over there," meaning the Bodega opposite, "talking it over, and I am now going back to them," and he went back—about half-an-hour after he returned with Brown, and said, "The business is off and they have gone away; I am sure it was the largeness of the number</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190205050061"/>
               <p>that has frightened them off the deal"—at 3 p.m. Devenport and I saw Mr. Sammes—he told Mr. Sammes that he could get 200, and at intervals of two or three days a further 200 or 300, so that in the course of ten days they would have the whole of the parcel of 1,150 notes, and that that course of procedure would inspire confidence, and that he should like the business to be done somewhere else because he thought we were being followed, and it was then stated that Mr. Sammes had a room at the Gannon Street Hotel in the name of Sanderson, and that he would see Devenport there in future—Mr. Sammes said he had come for the express purpose of completing the deal, and had brought the balance over and above the £3,000 required—he said to Devenport, "Here it is in these bags; cannot you get me the equivalent of this gold in notes to-day?"—Devenport said, "No, I cannot"—on March 6th, at 8.45 p.m., I again saw Devenport, and he said he had just left Wyndham's man, who had told him that Wyndham could have as many notes as Wyndham required, but that the business would have to be done as between Wyndham and himself, and that he had arranged that the business should be completed on Saturday, as that would be most convenient for Wyndham, as there was no racing on that day, and he asked me to make an appointment so that I could take him up to the room at the Cannon Street Hotel to see my principal—the next afternoon, Friday, I took Devenport to see Mr. Sammes at 3 o'clock on Friday at room 62, Cannon Street Hotel, and he told Mr. Sammes he had arranged to get 200 notes, that he was then going down to see Walter Brown from whom He would get £150, and to a Mr. Rees, of Poplar, from whom he hoped to get the balance, because he had to pay for the notes before they were delivered to him—on Saturday, March 8th, about 4 p.m., I took two small parcels of notes which Brown had handed to me to the Cannon Street Hotel, room 61, next door to room 62. where I saw a number of the City Police, who took the numbers of them and handed them back to me—I then went back with Devenport to room 62, where I handed the notes to Mr. Sammes, who said to Devenport that the business could be completed in a cab, anywhere Devenport suggested, and Deven<lb/>port suggested that at 7 o'clock we should arrive in a cab outside Coburn Road railway station of the Great Eastern Railway with the money to pay for the notes, £250, and that Devenport should call later in the evening at Cannon Street Hotel for the balance of £300, making the purchase price £550 for the 200 notes at £2 15s. per note—when the cab arrived at Coburn Road it was arranged that Devenport would have the notes either with him or in the immediate neighbourhood, that he would hand them to. Sammes who could take them up into <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the lavatories, examine them, and if he found them correct, come back and hand over the £250 for them—Mr. Sammes and I accordingly arrived in a four-wheeled cab at 7 p.m that evening at Coburn Road Station—Devenport came up and said, "Back in a few minutes"—he went away and returned in two or three minutes, and gave two small packages to Mr. Sammes, who then left the cab and Devenport got in—Mr. Sammes returned to the cab and said, "They are all right, Fry," and to Devenport he said, "You had better hold these until Fry pays you," and at that moment the cab was surrounded</p>

I came out of prison on January 21st, 1900. since when I have earned money by writing magazine articles, and I am now engaged in some translations—I was not a member of the Whippet Club in Chancery Lane—I have been there, but not for the purpose of gambling—it was a gambling club, but since 1897 I have never had a shilling on a horse or a card—after I found the note that I changed was bad I did not say to Devenport, "If I knew where to get notes like this I would take care that my wife and family should not live in one room," or anything remotely resembling it, and Devenport did not reply, "If what you say is true, I would not have one of them on me for a thousand pounds," or anything remotely resembling it—the only thing Devenport ever said resembling that was that he was never <hi rend="italic">mug</hi> enough himself to put one down—I never suggested for a moment that I would get rid of the bad notes for Devenport.—I say that before March 4th I endeavoured to pre<lb/>vent Devenport from entering into this business and entirely deny that I am more or less responsible for Devenport's present position.</p>

When I found that the note given to Laws was bad I did all I could to dissuade Devenport from going on in the course he had begun—when the police requested me to assist them 1 said I was the last person on earth willing to get anybody into trouble—my conversation with Devenport lasted two hours—he never thought he was running one iota of a risk—I desired to act in a friendly way to him—he said, "Why, Levy himself never knew these notes were forged, he thought they were good notes, but they had been stolen from somebody's <hi rend="italic">jug</hi>—he used the word <hi rend="italic">"jug,"</hi> I know—I only saw Gibbons once and that was on March 4th, and up to that time the whole of the proceedings had gone on without his personality entering into them at all—in the first conversation I had with him he expressed doubt about the scheme and it was at that interview that I said, "<hi rend="italic">Fitzey</hi> seems to be putting Wyndham off the deal.'</p>

Sagar was there—between the 9th and 12th Fry placed himself almost entirely at our disposal—on February 14th I saw him again, first in the morning and again about 6 p.m., in Mason's Avenue, Coleman Street—he was introduced to Sammes by Davidson—Sammes and Fry left us—they subsequently returned and brought back an envelope which Sammes handed to Davidson—it contained four £5 notes, of which I took the numbers one E/74 and three of E/45.</p>

I live at 12, Warmington Road, Herne Hill—I am out of regular employment—on the evening of February 5th I was at the Whippet Club and saw Fry there, and afterwards I saw Devenport with Brown and Levy—a game of cards was played and Levy and Devenport took part in it—Brown did not play—I saw him talking to Fry—Fry brought me a £5 note which afterwards turned out to be spurious—I noticed that Brown had a small roll of notes in his hand—I cannot say if this is one from the roll—I changed it into gold and put it into my pocket—I had no other notes there at that time—I handed the gold to Fry and he handed it to Brown—I heard Devenport ask Brown to lend him some money—he had lost at the game—Brown threw down some gold—a short time after<lb/>wards Fry, Devenport, Brown, and Levy left the club—later that evening I looked at the note which I had received from Fry—my suspicions were aroused, and the next day I sent it to Parr's Bank, through a friend of mine, Mr. Clarke, he brought it back, and in consequence of what he told me I saw Fry in the afternoon—I made a statement to him about the note and went with him to find Devenport and Brown—we were not successful, and consequently we went to Liverpool Street Station to find Devenport—we did not see him there, and together we went home to Walthamstow</p>

Ilford—on Monday, February 17th, I accidentally met Davidson in Basinghall Street, and had a conversation with him, and later the same evening I was introduced to Fry—it was the first occasion I had ever spoken to him—that same evening I went with Fry to the Ship in Finsbury Pavement—outside the Ship I saw Devenport—that was the first time I had seen him—Fry introduced me to him as his principal, who could buy forged notes or other securities—it was said that my principal was on the Continent, and could get rid of any amount of notes—50s. per note was mentioned as the price I should have to pay—Devenport then left us and went across the road—he returned with an envelope, which he handed to Fry, and said that there were four notes in it, but that they were not the best specimens he could show him—I said I must take them and examine them privately before I could do any business with him, to which he consented—Fry and I drove in a cab to Mason's Avenue, Coleman Street—I left Fry in the cab and went and found Davidson, Sagar, and Outram—we went into an office in Coleman Street—I told Davidson Fry was in the cab, and he went and took the envelope from him—he came back with it—it was opened in my presence—it contained four bank notes—the particulars of them were taken by the police—we rejoined Fry, the envelope was returned to him, and he and I drove back together to see Devenport—I remained in the cab while Fry went into the Ship—he came out with Devenport—I cannot swear if I had the envelope in my possession then, either Fry or I had it—I suggested we should drive into Finsbury Square—we all three did so—we stopped the cab—we remained in it—I said to Devenport that the samples were all right, and if he could deliver the bulk according to the samples we could do business at the quoted price—he said he thought he could deliver 200 at once, and that he thought he could deliver up to 1,500—I said I would communicate with my people on the Continent and would let him know the result, but that it would take three or four days—he said he thought he could deliver by then—I said that Fry was my agent, and I would leave the matter in his hands to make arrangements—we parted then—on February 20th, at the request of Davidson, I went to a room on the second floor at 13, Imperial Buildings, Ludgate Circus, about 3 p.m.—Fry and Devenport came in—Fry said, "I have brought him here to explain," meaning Devenport—they had put the price up to 60s. per note—I said, "I have already advised my people that they can be</p>

               <p>Fry overtook me, and in consequence of what he said I went to room 62, Cannon Street Hotel, where in a short time I was joined by Devenport and Fry—Devenport still could not get his money, and he wanted me to pay the £250 for the purpose of getting the notes—I would not listen to that, it was cash against notes with me—he said he could let me have twenty-one or twenty-three immediately, and that he had sent Tommy Brown to get them—I said such a small parcel was no earthly use to me—I saw them again about 2 p.m.—Devenport said he was still unable to get the money, and he asked me again to help him—he said he had seen Walter Brown and Tommy Brown, but that he had not seen Rees—I said I could not let him have the money without the notes, as I would not take the responsibility on my own shoulders, but I would communicate with my people in Paris by telephone—he said he had come from Wyndham's—that he had seen the notes in Wyndham's sideboard, where he kept his spirits—that there were every one of 200, as he said there were, that they looked lovely, and that Wyndham would not part with them without the money—Devenport said the 200 notes could be taken up or delivered at Coborn Road Station—an appointment was then made for three o'clock at the same place—just before three I was in room 61, once with Fry and once without him—I saw Davidson and a number of police officers there—Fry produced nine notes—I examined them with the police, the numbers were taken and the notes handed back to me—later on I was in No. 62, and Fry and Devenport came in—I produced the nine notes and said, "There are only nine, you said there were eleven"—there had been twenty<lb/>three originally, they had been reduced to eleven, and then dwindled to nine—Devenport said something to Fry to the effect that there had been twenty-three, but they had been reduced in some way—he said the bulk was better than the samples—the first arrangement was that they should be handed over at Imperial Buildings, or at the hotel, and the latter one that they should be handed over at Coborn Road Station—but at that interview Devenport said his people would not bring them into the City—he then proposed that I should go down to Coborn Road Station with the money—he would meet me at the station, and if all was right he would go round the corner and get the 200 notes—I was to take them up stairs to the railway station and examine them in the lavatory—turning to Fry he said, "That is how I did it with <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi>"—after I had examined the notes I was to come down to the cab, if all was right we could go round the corner and settle the deal by my handing him the full amount of cash against the notes—after meeting him at three o'clock I said I had been in com<lb/>munication with my principals and they had given me instructions to go on with the buying of the notes—I understood he had been unsuccessful in getting the £250 which he was out of—I kept the nine sample notes in my possession until I handed them over to the police—the appointment at Coborn Road was to be at 7 p.m.—I drove there with Fry in a four-wheel cab—Detective Landy was present in the lavatory when I examined the 200 notes that I had taken from Devenport—on returning to the cab it was surrounded by the police and the arrest effected.</p>

               <p>February 17th—I had known Davidson a great number of years—when I met him on this evening he told me he was on a difficult job, but he did not tell me what it was—I have never been engaged with him before—I assisted him in this case because he asked me—I neglected my business very much through this—there was no arrangement as to what I should be paid—I have not been paid anything yet—I knew nothing of Fry except that he was mixed up with this Jubilee seat business, but I did not know it was the same Fry who had been convicted until we got back to the Ship, On February 20th, when Fry brought Devenport in it was Fry who said, "They have put the price up to 60s."—but Devenport agreed to it—I do not think I suggested that we should split the difference—in my note here I have got down that Devenport said we would split the difference—when Devenport and Fry came in on February 21st, Devenport said he had not got the notes—I showed him the gold on that occasion because I wanted him to see I meant business—I thought he was going to throw the business over—I saw him again on March 4th—he said the man who had the notes would not part with them without the money—I did not then think Deven<lb/>port was going to drop the whole matter"—when I said to Fry, "Are you prepared to go on the Continent "the business had been resumed—I am quite sure that Devenport said on March 8th that he had been down to Wyndham's—I should say that Devenport knew where Wyndham lived—I have not heard Devenport say that he would not carry one of these notes for a thousand pounds.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">the Prisoner</hi>). I have pleaded guilty to the counts charging me with uttering 200 counterfeit Bank of England notes—I was manager at the Bull Inn, Devonshire Street, Bishopsgate, up to January 30th—prior to that I had known Devenport, Gibbons, and Freeman for five or six months—I knew Freeman also as Wyndham and Gibbons as Fitzy—I have seen them at the Bull—Freeman and Gibbons used to come there together—Devenport was there oftener than they were—he was very seldom there with them, but I have seen him in their company—I thought they were racing men—on January 30th I saw <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi>—I do not know what his real name is, I only know him as <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi>—I do not know the name Cohen at all—I know he went by the name of Brown and Wilson—I saw Devenport with him on the 30th, and saw him give Devenport a Bank of England note—I do not know what its value was—I saw Devenport give it to Levey, who took it away and returned after a short time, and I saw him hand some gold to Devenport—he gave some of it to <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi>, and offered 5s. to Levey—Devenport then stood drink to the party—later that day I saw Devenport, Walter Brown, and <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> cross Bishopsgate Street—I know Walter Brown as a manufacturer of boots at Kingsland—I think he lived at Putney—later that day I saw Devenport at Bishopsgate Street Station—we all went to the Prince of Wales after leaving the Bull—I was living at Stratford then, and therefore went to the same station as Devenport—I met him on the following Monday, February 3rd, in Bishopsgate, when he asked me to get into his trap, and we went to the Prince of Wales—as we were driving towards Islington Devenport said that he had some notes which he got in playing at cards off a <hi rend="italic">mug</hi>, and he was going to change them—he said that I was to change them one at a time at public-houses—he did not say at that time whether the notes were good or bad—I believed them to be good—he gave me one at a time, three altogether—I changed each of them singly at a different public-house—I changed them by calling for drink and paying for it with them—I handed the change to Devenport—there was a third person in the trap, a man named Nash—we drove back to Bishopsgate, and Devenport and Nash took the trap home—I know Smith's fish shop, it is opposite Devonshire Street, and about one minute from Liverpool Street Station—we went inside the shop, and Devenport said, "Do you know what you have been doing?"—I said, "No"—he said, "Those notes were bad"—he said he had had twenty-five, but he did not tell me how many were gone—he did not say how many were still on him—he said they had not been paid for, and that he had got them from <hi rend="italic">I mey—he</hi> did not say if anybody else was in this matter with him—after we had been in the fish shop a little time Walter Brown and <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> came in—they did not come in together—Devenport and <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> were talking about the notes, and</p>

Coborn Road at 7 o'clock—when I left Devenport it was arranged I should go to Wyndham's house, get the notes and take them to Devenport—I got there about 6 o'clock and found Wyndham and Gibbons still in the same room—I told them that Devenport and his man would be round at the station at 7 o'clock, that I was to take the notes round to the station, and Devenport would bring the money round—they said that would be satisfactory, and Wyndham said that it would be best that I should take the notes round before Devenport arrived, because they did not want him to be seen coming to the house—I agreed to that—Gibbons produced two parcels from his inside pocket—he gave them to me and said, "Look at them and see if they are all right, you will find 100 in each parcel"—I. opened the parcels—I saw there were counterfeit bank notes in each, but. I did not count them—I put them into my jacket pocket—I went into Litchfield Road and then into Coborn Road—I met Devenport—I told him I had got them and I meant to give them to him—he said, "No, keep them a minute "and told me to wait on the other side of the road until Sammes came up—I did not know his name then—he said he would come and fetch them—I went to the opposite side of the road and waited a short time—I saw a four-wheel cab drive up—Devenport came across the road to me—I partly met him—he said, "Here he is," and I gave him the two parcels of notes which I had received from Gibbons in Wyndham's presence—Devenport went to the cab—I waited on the other side of the road—within a very short time I was arrested—next day I remember having some conversation with Gibbons at the Cloak</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Re-examined</hi>). I said yesterday that I had not seen Devenport between the Thursday and Monday, but I saw him on the following Friday—I was driving with him and another man named Nash—we were out till midnight—we had an accident about 11.30.</p>

I left the Bull on January 30th because I was discharged at a moment's notice on that day—Devenport gave a note to Levy—I saw it—I did not have it in my hand—I cannot say if it was good or bad—I have known Walter Brown about nine months—he is no relative of mine—I had £50 or £60 when I left the Bull, which I had saved, but I could not get it at the time—I only had £10 or £15 ready—I owed £15 to Mr. Scott, so had to pawn my things—I pawned a diamond stud and a diamond ring and got £25 for them—my other money was in the Post Office Savings Bank—I had seen Fry before February 5th, but not many times—I lent Devenport £1 at the Whippet Club—he suggested we should go to the other club in Chancery Lane—I do not think he knew it—we went with Fry—Fry was playing cards himself at the Whippet Club—he did not ask me for any money at Mooney's—I did not lend him any—he did not say he had none—I only saw <hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> at the Peacock once—then he was very angry about the way in which the negotiations were proceeding, and he said he would have no more to do with Devenport, but in future everything must go through me—I do not know if Devenport was too open in the matter—<hi rend="italic">I mey</hi> said it was too dangerous to be seen with him—Devenport saw me talking to Wyndham at Liverpool Street Station—but until I saw him on the 4th he knew nothing about any appointment at the Bodega—on the Friday before the arrest Devenport and I had an arrangement to meet at Smith's fish shop—Devenport did not come—I saw Wyndham there—he agreed to sell certain notes at £1 7s.—Devenport did not know of any arrangement made between Wyndham and myself on that occasion—on the day of the arrest—Devenport and I did not see the notes the first time we called at Wyndham's—they were only produced the second time that I went—I did not see Wyndham produce them from the whisky cupboard—both notes that I made in my pocket-book were from Devenport's dictation—I believe that Fry also took down from</p>

I only knew Freeman by the name of Wyndham—I believe that is the name he was betting under—I heard the name of Freeman before this case commenced, but not long—when I met him in Liverpool Street Station on March 3rd it was by accident—I was going home to Stratford—he would be going to Coborn Road, which was in the same direction—I introduced him to Fry, and we all three went down in the train together—there was no conversation in the train about the notes—we got to Coborn Road before closing time, but I am positive we did not go into the Plough in Mile End Road—we were not having a last drink—Freeman did not say he would go out and fetch Alf—"Alf "being Hurley—I was on the opposite side of Mile End Road when Wyndham knocked at the door—I told him I was going house hunting next day—I meant I was looking for a public-house, not for a house to live in—I was looking out for a fresh job—he told me if I heard of anything likely I might let him know—I believe that was in Fry's presence—it was not in connection with that business that Freeman and I arranged to meet next morning—I went to the Royal Hotel next morning by myself—I was standing outside and I met Freeman there—we went in together—at that time he was proposing to buy a bicycle from me for his daughter—but we did not have any conversation about it that day—the arrangement that I should meet him on March 8th was not solely in reference to the question of purchasing the bicycle—I do not think we had any conversation about it at all that day—I went to his house with Devenport about 2 p.m I was with Devenport all the morning—I was with him the whole time I was in Wyndham's house—I did not see any of the notes then—they were not produced from Wyndham's sideboard.</p>

I went to see Southgate about March 4th—I said to him, "Southgate, I want to see you respecting two forged £5 Bank of England notes, which were changed by you on February 14th, one at the Duke of York, Ampthill Road, and the other at the Morgan Arms—he said, "I never changed either of the notes, I was in the company of a man I have met at various sales, and I met him at the Caledonian Market on the day the notes were changed. On that day he sold a horse, And I saw him receive some Bank notes in payment for same, the reason I handed the note to Mr. Thorn at the Duke of York was because the man I was with was rather <hi rend="italic">boozed</hi>, the note that was changed at the Morgan Arms was handed by the man himself, and I believe he put his name on the back. I handed the five sovereigns to the man"—I said, "Do you know his name or where he resides"—he said, "No, I shall be going to Cale<lb/>donian Market on Friday, and no doubt shall see him there, and will communicate with you his name and address"—I got no communication from him—he was requested to attend the Mansion House on April 7th, when six prisoners were in the dock—Freeman, Hurley, Gibbons, and Levy were amongst them—I asked him to look and see if he could see the man who was in this company on the day the notes were changed, or if he knew either of the persons in the dock—he said "No, I have never seen either of them before in my life"—he had a good opportunity of seeing them—I asked him two or three times to go back and make sure.</p>

                  </hi>. I am Battery Sergeant Major of 136 Battery, Royal Field Artillery, stationed this year at Woolwich—the prisoner Gardner was pay sergeant, and Williams an ex-quartermaster-sergeant in the Army Pay Department, and from January to April this year he assisted Gardner with his accounts—I was in charge of the Battery Office—part of Gardner's duty was to prepare requisitions for the pay of mobilized Reservists—Gunner Bush was discharged from the mobilised Reservists on February 2nd—a money order was sent to him on February 12th addressed to Marsh Farm, Manningtree, Ipswich—I produce Bush's receipt, dated February 12th, 1902, for the amount, £6 2s.—I searched for the requisition for that amount and could not find it—I asked Gardner if he knew where it was—he told me he had handed it to Williams—that was after he had been placed under arrest on March 20th—I produce the requisition for the money order from the Pay List Army Form 1806 in Gardner's writing for £10 and £7 3s. 6d., payable at Conway Road, Plumstead, to Gunner Bush—it is sighed by the proper officer, Captain Bond, and certified by Lieutenant Potter to have been sent—it would have to be taken to the post office when the money was drawn—it is entered in the Pay List—the postmaster issues money orders upon the requisition and the numbers are put in the margin, 2616-7, in these orders, and the stamp showing the office, Artillery Place, Woolwich, February 28th—that is all in the ordinary course—I produce the post book of the Battery con<lb/>taining the date, February 28th, in which I find Gardner's entry of a letter to Quartermaster-Sergeant Williams, Charlton—I find no letter sent to Bush after February 12th in Bombardier Martin's writing—this telegram to Bush, "Do not answer any letter or telegram from anyone in Woolwich until I send you to-day, Gardner, 136 Battery," is Gardner's writing.</p>

M. S. Williams, Army Pay Corps, was, with the sanction of the officer commanding, appointed to instruct me in the duties of Pay Sergeant. During the month of February, 1902, Q. M. S. Williams made up the accounts of Gunner Bush, in which he has shown a balance credit of £17 3s. 6d. I told him the man was already settled up with till date of discharge. He said I did not understand, as this man had been to the front he was entitled to a gratuity, and asked for the money order requisition (<hi rend="largeCaps">AFO</hi> 1806) for £6 2s. 4d., the amount sent to Gunner Bush, which I gave to him, and have not seen it since. When I could not find it later in the month I asked him what he had done with</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="190205050089"/>
               <p>it. He said it did not matter about that time as it would be all right. Acting under instruction from Q. M. S. Williams I got the money order made payable to Gunner Bush, Conway Road, Plumstead, and forwarded the money orders to Q. M. S. Williams, No. 1, Nadine Street, Old Charlton, S.E. (one money order being for £10, the other for £7 3s. 6d.), together with a receipt to be signed and returned. The receipt was returned duly stamped and signed in the course of four or five days. On March 17th, 1902, a letter was received from the District Paymaster, asking why the money orders were made payable at Conway Road, when the man's permanent address on discharge was Manningtree, near Ipswich. I went and saw Q. M. S. Williams, and asked him about it, and he said it was a mistake on his part. He then asked me to go to Ipswich, and see Gunner Bush, saying he was too ill to go there himself, which I pro<lb/>mised to do. He then gave me instructions what to do, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, (1) Send a telegram to Gunner Bush, telling him not to communicate with anyone in Woolwich till he had seen me; (2) to bring Gunner Bush back with me to Woolwich if possible, paying all expenses; (3) if not able to bring him to Woolwich to offer him money, £2 and the balance of the £17 3s. 6d. to be forwarded to him as soon as possible; (4) to get a letter in Gunner Bush's handwriting, asking for his pay and war gratuity to be made payable at Plumstead; (5) if he received a letter or telegram from the District Paymaster or the 0. G. 136th Battery, asking what his last payment was, to say £17 3s. 6d. (which he promised to do). Gunner Bush refused to take any money, but gave the letter asked for. I went to Q. M. S. Williams' house at Charlton in the evening [<hi rend="italic">March</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1902] after returning from Ipswich and I saw him sick in bed. I told him about the interview with Gunner Bush, and about his refusing the £2, and that he had promised to say his last payment was £17 3s. 6d., which he said would be all right. Q. M. S. Williams then asked me had I heard about his being arrested on Sunday night, and I told him I had not heard of it He said it would not be in the papers, as he had arranged that it should not appear in the papers. He told me the whole case, and about the course he took by going to see the man the same as he had sent me to interview Gunner Bush. He told me that he gave the man of No. 2 Company A.S.C. a letter drafted to answer any letter that he might receive from Woolwich. He also told me that he had cashed the money orders and signed the receipt as Bush, and that he was asked no questions at the post office, and that he copied the signature off the one for £6 2s. 4d, which brought from his house. When the Pay List for February came back from the Army Pay Office with the observations there was, one asking why no gratuity had been charged for Gunner Doyle, Q. M. S. Williams asked me how long this man had been on furlough, and I told him the whole time I had been in the battery (which was about eighteen months). He asked me the man's address, which is at Plumstead. He made up the man's accounts, amounting to £15 odd, and told me to get the money order payable at Lee Road, Plumstead, as this man lived at Plumstead. I did not see anything wrong at the time. After telling me about his having been arrested I would not send it. He wrote to me twice asking when I</p>

I am a newsagent of 10, Brockley Road, New Cross—on Easter Monday, about 10.35 a.m., I went to this cab-shelter—the door was open—I went in and found a child without any clothing lying on the floor on a sheet of iron—it was not crying, but it made a mournful noise once—it was very cold—I gave information at the station, and when I went back a doctor had arrived—it is a shelter for cabmen only; it used to be locked, but the door was open.</p>

I am an engineer's labourer, of 8, Lambeth Walk—I knew the deceased—about 10.45 p.m., on March 16th, I was with him, my wife, and some others in St. George's Tavern, Lambeth Road—the deceased went out by himself—I followed about three minutes later—I saw all the prisoners round him swearing at him and saying what they would do to him—I did not see anything done to him, but he had been knocked down and kicked, and a young man had picked him up—he was standing up when I first saw him after coming out of the public-house—while the prisoners were there the deceased said to me, "Mr. Sheen, am I going to be knocked down and kicked and punched about like this for nothing?"—I took hold of him by the arm and said, "Come on, Mr. Rosser, come home"—I took him down the street to his house—my wife went with us—we had gone about twenty or thirty yards, when the prisoners followed us—just as we got to the deceased's door, the three men rushed at us—James Benson rushed at me and punched me in the face—I was knocked to the ground and kicked by the brothers Benson—I got up and tried to get away—some people shouted out, "Look out, he has got a knife"—James rushed at me, I got hold of his legs, he got round me and stuck the knife into my back—I fell down—I got up again and ran away—I fell in a doorway in a fainting condition—Preston and the two women had not done anything to me—I do not know where the deceased was when I was stabbed—I was taken to St. Thomas's hospital in a cab.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.</hi> I do not know a man named Joseph Sand—s I have never heard of him or of Frederick Richardson—Sands is not a relative of mine. I do not know if Richardson was charged at the South London Sessions with wounding Sands—I do not know if Benson was interested in Richardson—I know the Hercules in Kennington Road—I was not there on the 16th—I was in St. George's Tavern from about 8 to 10.50 p.m.—I went to the Lambeth Road entrance once during that time—I was not out of the house five minutes—I am known to the people serving there—the deceased was with me at 8 p.m. and was in my company till 10.45—it is quite untrue to suggest that we were in the Hercules at 9.30 with eight or nine others, and followed the prisoners down to St. George's Tavern—my party consisted of the deceased, my wife, Mr. Ray, and my<lb/>self—I did not see Michael Benson knocked down and covered with blood—I and my party did not surround him and punish him for the part he had taken in getting Richardson acquitted.</p>

               <p>and a young man named Edward Ray—I did not see any of the prisoners there—I saw the deceased go out by himself—we followed a few minutes afterwards—I saw all the prisoners round the deceased—my husband said to him, "come down home, Mr. Rosser, we want nothing to do with those,"—I did not hear the deceased say anything—he had been brutally kicked—I saw the kicks at the hospital—I did not see the prisoners actually beating the deceased—we all three went down the street—when we got to the deceased's house the prisoners came up and got round us—I saw the deceased being beaten—the two females were round him, but I could not see much because I had quite enough to do to look to my husband who was laying on the ground—he had been stabbed by James Benson with a large knife—he was standing up when he was stabbed, and some people shouted out, "Look out, he has got a knife"—I saw the other prisoners round the deceased—I went to the hospital with my husband and the deceased in a cab—Edwards had on a white sailor hat with a black band round it and a fawn-coloured coat like she has on now—she had not got her hat on her head, she carried it from St. George's Tavern to the place where my husband was stabbed—it was one of those hats which fasten with a pin thrust right through the top.</p>
