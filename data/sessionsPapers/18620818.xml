                  </hi>. I live at 32, Cumming-street, Pentonville, and am one of the shorthand writers to the Court of Bankruptcy—I attended there on 9th June when the bankrupt was examined—I had previously taken a declaration under the Act of 1861 to take the examination accurately in shorthand, and make a true transcript—the defendant was sworn on that day, and examined by Mr. Turner—I have here the transcript of the examination (<hi rend="italic">This stated that the goods were delivered at the end of February or the beginning of March; that he had them for the purpose of carrying on an hotel in Skinner-street; that they were afterwards removed to Messrs. Cutten and Davis's, and that he had pledged part of them for </hi>32<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.,<hi rend="italic"> and afterwards sold his interest in the tickets, and with the money had paid wages, and Mr. Catchpole, his attorney, for the fees of the court; that he had been bankrupt about sixteen years ago, and not since, though he was insolvent eight years ago</hi>).</p>

I am one of the firm of Smee and Co., uphosterers, of Finsbury-pavement, and am one of the assignees of the estate—I was not present when the prisoner first came for goods—I am not aware that goods to the amount of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. were given up—I think they realized from 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the pound on the cost price—out of that 35<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was set down for rent—they were all goods purchased at our establish<lb/>ment.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> When did you first see him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The third time he called—it was about six weeks before the goods were supplied—he gave me references to whom I referred, and was satisfied—the goods were sold to him on credit—the understanding I had with him in conversation was that there was to be, I think, twelve months' credit—that was embodied in a letter—he proposed terms of credit rather vaguely as to what he could pay, and I asked him to state what he actually could pay under any circumstances, and certain instalments were mentioned; 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in April, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each succeeding month—I think that would amount to the same thing as twelve months' credit—he stated that he should be able to pay off a good deal more than those instalments—he frequently spoke of his expectations from the business—he said that he probably could pay more than 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month; and, if the business succeeded, he would clear off the whole in a few months—that conversation was in January—I arranged for the articles to be supplied at the same time—the order was completed during February and March—I am quite sure he made a positive promise to pay 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in April—I sent to him for the money on 15th April, and again on the 16th—he then called on me and asked for time; but, I believe, no time was mentioned—I sent my attorney, Mr. Turner, to him next day—we proposed that he should give an unconditional bill of sale on all the goods, which he declined, and we com<lb/>menced an action against him for the whole amount, and issued a summons in bankruptcy against him at the same time—the goods were not sold at credit prices; we should have given him two and a half discount for cash—after this petition everything that was not pawned was taken away from the hotel and sold by us, as assignees, by auction, at Cutten and Davis's, the brokers to the Court—I was not present at the sale—I have no doubt that</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180005"/>
               <p>the amount they realized was 39<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were sold in one day, I believe—they get over broker's sales very quickly, and great bargains are sold—I do not know when the attorneys called upon the prisoner.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a salesman in the employ of Messrs.

I am servant to Armelino du Coster Ricci, of 2, Inwood-cottages, Hounslow, in the parish of Isleworth—on Monday night, 16th July, I fastened up the house at half-past 10 o'clock—there is a little window in the safe which had a piece of paper in it to keep it partly open, and let the air in—I fastened the back-kitchen shutters with a little button inside—I came down next morning about 6 o'clock, and found the back kitchen shutters open; I found a match box and a pair of shoe brushes on the floor—on the front-kitchen table I found some matches, and some more, which had been lighted, in the fire-place—two bottles of beer had been emptied, and the bottles set beside the cupboard—I missed three silver dessert-spoons, a silver table-spoon, five plated forks, a table cloth of my masters, and two dresses, a shawl, and a piece of calico of mine, which were all safe when I went to bed—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I found these gloves on the table, they were not there the night before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a carman in the service of Messrs. Shoolbred, and live at 9, Huntley-street, Tottenham-court-road—on Sunday, 13th July, about 11 o'clock in the evening, I was at the end of Cannon-street—I saw the prisoner there, driving a Hansom's cab—he struck me across the face with the thong end of the whip—I let go my wife, who was on my arm, and caught him why the leg of his trousers and the stock of his whip behind, and asked him why he struck me—he made use of some foul expression, and said, why did not I get out of the way—I said, "My dear fellow, I was not in your way in the least; you neither had to pull your horse up, nor on one side, for me,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180015"/>
               <p>and why did you strike me?"—he said, "Let me go, or I will kick your brains out"—I said, "I will if you promise not to strike me again"—some bystander said, "<hi rend="italic">Tom,</hi> why don't you keep your whip still? the man has no wish to detain you"—I said that I had not, if he promised not to strike me again—with that I let go, thinking he would go about his business—he then turned round and struck me three or four times across my head; but, baring my head down, it did not hurt me—I made a dart at him to catch him again—he then thrust his whip back into my eye, and drove away over the bridge—I did not notice Burns at that time; there were several persons round—I followed the cab after that, nearly down to the dark arches at the Fresh-wharf, calling out, "Stop that cab"—I was then so exhausted that I stopped—the sight of my eye is quite gone—the prisoner is the man—I have not the least doubt of it, if I had he would have had the benefit of it long ago—this happened right opposite the Ring William statue, where there were five or six lights burning—I saw the prisoner next when he was brought out from his house; I do not know the date—I went with the policeman and Burns—I waited outside with Burns, about 200 yards away, in the same street or terrace—the policeman came out with one man first, and then came out again with two men—he did not bring out the prisoner there—the two men were brought out of the yard where the cabs stand—we then went across Primrose-hill to the prisoner's private house—the policeman went in—Burns and I stayed some 200 yards away from the house—we remained till the policeman came out with the prisoner—I at once identified him.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 22, Acorn-street, Bishopsgate-street—on Sunday evening, 13th July, I was at the end of Cannon-street, near the King William statue—I saw the prisoner there, and the prosecutor holding him by the leg and his whip—the prisoner was driving a Hansom's cab—he said, "If you don't let go, I will kick your brains out"—he then took the whip deliberately and shoved it in his eye—I was close to him—I am quite sure the prisoner is the man—after that the cab drove off, and I fol<lb/>lowed it nearly half-way over London-bridge, when I was obliged to give over—I was not able to take the number; he kept whipping me—I then returned to where this happened—in about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes he came back; somebody struck me with a whip, which made me look, up sharp, and I recognized the same man—I followed him; and he got down off his cab and kicked me in the ribs—he said, "I will give it to you for following me"—a policeman was then coming up St. Martin's-lane, Cannon-street, and he went off—he was twenty yards off of his cab; that was the reason I could not have the number—he ran back, got on to his</p>

I am a cabman in the employ of Mr. Higgins—I remember Sunday, 13th July, perfectly well—I returned home with my cab about half-past 12 o'clock, and, as I was just going out of the yard the prisoner drove in with his cab, George Higgins's four wheeler—I helped him to take his horse out—I was going away, and he said, "Stop a minute; I will walk with you home;" and we walked together as far as John-street—as we were coming into Parker's-road) I said, "It has just struck I;" and I pulled out my watch and said, "We are late."</p>

Simpkin and Marshall, Stationer's-hall-court; the letter was signed with my ordinary signature—this piece of paper (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) bears my signature; I cannot say it was part of that letter, it is part of a letter written by me—I put the order and letter into an envelope and fastened it, and gave it to Wise to post between 9 and 10 in the morning of the 24th.</p>

                  </hi>. I am butler to Mr. Samuel Gregson, M.P., for Lancaster, of 32, Upper Harley-street, in the parish of Marylebone—on the night of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180033"/>
               <p>6th June, I fastened up the premises about 11 o'clock—I went round and ascertained that they were all properly secured—I slept in the butler's pantry in the basement—I was awoke about 2 o'clock by hearing a noise in the kitchen—I went to the kitchen and heard a man's voice say, "It is only me, don't lock me in;" but I did lock him in—I then went up and rang the alarum bell—on going down again to the kitchen I found a man coming through the kitchen door—the post of the door was broken where the bolt of the lock goes in; he had broken his way out by forcing the door post—I struck him in the face with my fist—he followed up and worked his way to the pantry at the end of the passage—we fought in the pantry with no weapons—he was more powerful than I and threw me on the table—after that we had a tustle and he threw me on the floor—he thea said, "If you don't give up the property I have a knife as sharp as a razor, and I will cut your throat "—he produced a knife, I saw it, and I then got a small poker in the pantry and struck him—it was in the dark, and I can't say positively where I struck him; it was on the face or head; I did my best—we got to the pantry door at the foot of the kitchen stairs, the two maidservants came down with a light—they went to give an alarm, and he followed them up stairs—I distinctly saw a clasp-knife in hand at he went up stairs—they opened the street door and called murder and police! and he took the opportunity to run out, and I lost sight of him—to the best of my recollection the servants only had one light on the stairs—I had no opportunity of seeing the man's face when the light was brought—there was a very small lamp which he lighted himself—I saw his face in the first instance, till we got fighting, but not when the maid servants had the light, his back was towards me—the lamp that he lighted is a lamp that is used in the kitchen, the man must have lighted it, it was not usually lighted at that time—that enabled me to see his face in the first instance, as he came out of the door and broke his way from the kitchen to the passage; that was the only time I had an opportunity of sating his face—I did see it by the light of that lamp, and I had a small light which I had lighted in my pantry, so that between the two lights I had a glimpse of him; I saw his face—to the best of my belief the prisoner is the man; I have no doubt; I say so from his voice—he is the same sized man, and the same voice—I heard his voice at the Marylebone police-court—the simi<lb/>larity of voice struck me as well as the similarity of appearance—I believe that he is the man.</p>

BESLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was the date at which you heard his voice at the police-court? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I can't say, there were two remands—I was there when a man named Abraham Law was charged with the same burglary—he was taken in custody in the neighbourhood—I think it was two or three weeks after Law had been discharged that I went to the police-court again and saw the prisoner in custody—Law was brought in in a kind of confusion with his face bleeding, and I said he was a big man—he might have been more corpulent than the prisoner—I heard Law speak at the police-court; his voice was not like the voice of the man—I said be was not the man—they asked me if. I would swear he was the man or was not, and I said neither—I could not swear he was not the man in the position I was in that night, I had been knocked about a good deal, and ill-used—I said I would not swear he was not the man—that was the next day after the burgulary—I did not hear Law's voice—I was wrong in say<lb/>ing that I did, I thought you meant this man's voice—at the time the female servants came down stairs the man and I were fighting at the foot</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180034"/>
               <p>of the stairs—I don't think I gave him any blows after he turned to follow the maids up stain—I had the poker in my hand, but I don't think I used it—I don't know which of the servants had the candle, they were together—they did not turn round immediately, they faced the man, and said "What is the matter, whatever is it"—I said, "There are thieves in the house"—and the man said, "I am not a regular burglar, but this man has insulted me, and will not let me go now "—the women then turned round, and ran up stairs screaming, taking the candle with them—I don't know whether the small light in the kitchen had been put out before the servants came down, I think it most have been—my lamp was alight on the pantry table—I did not put it out at all, it was knocked out by the man, perhaps ten minutes before the women came down—I think the man put out the lamp in the kitchen, or it might have gone out of itself; it had not been used for a week or two—I have said that had I met this man in the street, I should have hesitated to give him in custody; I should have looked at him fancying he was the man; but I might have had a scruple about giving him into custody—that was the only doubt I had.</p>

               <p>not know from whom it came—the meat was seen by Mr. Newman, the City inspector—I had not formed a judgment on it before the inspector saw it, but afterwards my opinion was that the meat was not good, and I sent it to the slaughter-house to go away for my pigs; it never went into my shop at all—I can tell by close examination the difference from meat which is bad, by reason of disease in the animal, and meat which is bad from putridity.</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the inspectors of meat for the City of London, appointed by the Commissioners of Sewers—on Friday morning, 11th July, I saw Sandy with another man, wheeling some meat in Newgate-street, and followed them to the shop of Mr. Nicklinson—as the meat was going along, I saw a portion of it which was uncovered, in consequence of</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180047"/>
               <p>which I followed it into the shop and examined it—I found that it was the four quarters of a cow that had evidently died from disease—the blood was in the tissues of the meat, and had not been taken from it; the lining of the lungs and the belly was very much inflamed—the lungs themselves were not there, but I could tell from the cavity of the chest—it was alto<lb/>gether in such a state as to be unfit for human food—if four quarters of beef were put in a cart, covered with a cloth, and with live calves under<lb/>neath, the meat would not have presented the appearance which this did, even if it had been there five nights; it may have made it bad but not diseased—I can tell the difference between putrid meat and the meat of an animal that has died from disease—in my judgment the indications that I saw existed the previous day—there is a large quantity of meat sold at Mr. Nicklinson's shop every day—I, and the other inspectors inspect that place every day as part of Newgate-market—I went down to Bengo's at Kingston that same day and found him washing his cart in his slaughter-house—I told him I was an officer, and had come down from London concerning a body of beef that I had seized that morning, that bad been brought that morning by Sandy, who had told me that he brought it from Bengo's place, it Kingston—Bengo said be was wrong, he had not had any beef on his premises for four or five weeks—I asked him if any one else had dressed a cow on his premises—he said, "No"—I asked him if any one had borrowed his cart to fetch a cow in—he said, "No, he had nothing at all to do with any beef, but that there was another Bengo in the town who might possibly have sent it—on his making that statement I left him—Bridges, the policeman, and Fisher were with me at the time—on the 17th I went to look after Neville, and found him in Kingston market-place—I told him I had got a summons for him to appear at the Guildhall police-court, London, concering four quarters of a cow that he had sent to Mr. Nicklinson of Newgate-market—he said it surprised him as he knew nothing about it—Fisher was with me then.</p>

                  </hi>. On the morning of 11th July last, at about half-past 5, Newman called my attention to four quarters of a cow at Mr. Nicklinson's—I examined the carcase—it was unfit for human food—it had the appearence of a cow that had died from lung disease—that was quite apparent to any one at all familiar with meat—I should think it would have presented the same appearance on the previous day—it was fresh, not tainted by the weather—I went with Mr. Newman and a police officer that afternoon, and saw Bengo—we told him who we were, and asked him if be knew anything of a cow that had been sent to Newgate-market that morning, or rather the day before—he said he did not know anything at all about it—he knew nothing about a cow—we asked him several times if he had had a cow on his premises that day—he said he had not; and, in fact, had not had a cow on his premises for some weeks—he was then asked if he had lent his cart to any one to fetch such a thing—he said no he had not, and knew nothing about it—this conversation took place in Bengo's place, which is in a lane close in Kingston—on Thursday, the 17th, I went again to Kingston with Newman, and saw Neville in the market-place there, and told him we were officers from the City, and had come down there respecting a cow, which it was stated he had sent to Mr. Nicklinson's at Newgate market—he said he knew nothing at all about it—it was the first he had heard of it—we asked, did not he know anything about a cow that came from Mr. Wallace's, of Ham<lb/>common—he said, "I know nothing about it; this is the first I have heard of it; I never heard it mentioned before"—I do not think anything was said about where the cow was put into the cart—he denied it altogether, and we served him with a summons and left him.</p>

I keep the Red Lion public-house, in Horton-street, Clare-market—on the evening of 22d July, between 7 and 8 o'clock, the prisoner Gibbons came into my house, and asked for a half-quartern of rum, she gave me a shilling in payment, and I gave her 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I put the shilling in the till—there was other money there—she drank the rum, and went away—in about a quarter of an hour afterwards she came in with three other women—Miles was one of them—Gibbons asked for a quartern of rum, and tendered a shilling in payment—I gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—they drank that between them—I put that shilling in the till—there was then in the till nothing but sixpences and the other shilling—a pot of beer was then called for by Miles, which was 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—she gave me a shilling, and I gave her 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I also put that shilling in the till—the other two women were there then—Miles afterwards called for a quartern of rum, and tendered a shilling in payment—I looked at it; it was a bad one—I had suspicion of it, and put it on one side under<lb/>neath the counter, on a ledge which comes out, by itself—the quart of beer was not drunk—Miles said she wanted half-a-pint—she took an oath she</p>

               <p>would not drink out of a quart pot, and then asked for half a pint, and said she would pay for it herself—she gave me a shilling; and I gave her 11<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. change—I tried that shilling with ray teeth; it was rather soft—I then put it the other, under the ledge—about this time a person came in and asked me for change for a half-sovereign, and I went to my till to get the change—I found the three bad shillings there, and gave them in change for the half-sovereign, and the rest in sixpences—she tried, one of the shillings in my presence, and said it was bad—I then sent ray servant for a constable, and gave all four of the women in charge, the two prisoners amongst them—the policeman took the five bad shillings I had taken—I gave the person who came for change good money, and told her to hold her tongue, as the people were in the house who had given me the money—I sent for a police-man quietly, and they were just going away when he came in—I put no other shilling in the till while they were drinking in the house, or before.</p>

I am an unfortunate woman, and live at 2, Victoria-places, Shadwell—on Saturday evening, 26th July, the prisoner was brought by Sank Smith, a coloured girl, to that place—he slept with me that night, and promised, to give me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in the morning—the coloured girl took his money, and she and the landlady had the clothes and money between them—in the morning the prisoner asked me where his things were—he knew very well where they were, for be missed them at half-past 11 o'clock over night—the coloured girl was after taking his money and things then—I saw her take them—I was sitting in the kitchen when she brought them down—she brought down his trousers and jacket, and what money he had, I suppose in the trowsers, she had between her and the landlady, and she took the trowsers up stairs again—I did not see what the money was—I did not see any money at all—she took it in to the landlady, whatever she had in her hand—I got up about 3 o'clock in the morning, and went out drinking, leaving the prisoner in bed—afterwards he came up to me in the street, <hi rend="italic">catched</hi> hold of me by the shoulder, and stabbed me in two places, behind the back, and under my arm—that was about a quarter-past 7 o'clock, I think—I do not recollect any<lb/>thing about the blows myself, for I was tipsy—1 remember his coming down the street; but I do not recollect anything else before I found myself in the London Hospital on Sunday morning—I was then wounded—I was in the hospital three weeks—I came out last Saturday.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner.</hi> I was met by this woman on the Saturday night; she won't acknowledge that she robbed me, and it is no use asking her any questions. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> I did not rob him—when he came to the house he brought the girl of colour with him—that was about half-past 10 at night; they both went up stairs into a room—I knew the coloured girl—she lived with the land<lb/>lady's sister; she brought him to the house—he went with her first, and slept with me afterwards; the coloured girl left him about 11—after she brought the things down she went straight away—I do not know whether she took his things with her—she took them into the room to the landlady, and she did not bring them out any more—I don't know what became of the money; they had it between them—I saw them divide it—I do not know what became of the clothes.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer living at 15, Victoria-street, St. George's—on 26th July, about a quarter-past 7, in the morning, I was in Victoria-street, and saw the prisoner come to the prosecutrix, lay hold of her by one hand, and stick the knife in her back three or four times—I was the knife—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—the last blow was in the shoulder, and he could not pull the knife out again—the woman fell—I gave an alarm, and he was taken—I had not seen any altercation between them—the woman said nothing to him previously—I saw him go to the court where he was robbed; he could not find her there, and he came down the street and stabbed her—he had on an old pair of his shipmate's trowsers, a shirt, and a pair of boots; nothing else.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, K</hi> 19). In consequence of information, I went to Bluegate-fields; I saw the prosecutrix there; she was wounded in several places, and was bleeding very much—I saw a knife sticking in her right shoulder; it was firmly fixed through her clothes and flesh into the shoulder, right up to the hilt, as far as it could go; we could not get it out—I placed her in a cart and took her to the hospital, where I saw the surgeon take out the knife—I returned to the station, and told the prisoner that the woman was stabbed in four or five places, and I believed she would die—the prisoner said, "Whatever if the matter with her; I have done it; she has robbed me of my clothes, and all my money"—I had gone to the house a short time before the woman was stabbed, and searched it, and I found a pair of trowsers between the bed and mattress, in the second floor front-room, where the prisoner said he had slept with the woman—I had seen the prisoner walking about the street, about three-quarters of an hour before—he was then in his drawers, shirt, and stockings; he complained of being robbed at this house—I went there and saw the prosecutrix, and told her in the prisoner's presence that he accused her of robbing him—she said, "I have not robbed him," and she rushed at him and struck him on the head with her fist—this was about three-quarters of an hour before she was wounded—she swore a word I should not like to repeat, and called him a black nigger—she said they had passed the night together, and when she awoke in the morning, the clothes were gone—she was very drunk and violent—the prisoner had no knife then—I advised him to go and get some things.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at the London Hospital—on Sunday morning, 27th July, about 7 o'clock, the prosecutrix was brought there—she had a punctured wound of the right shoulder, in which a knife was firmly fixed—it was buried to the depth of four inches; the whole length of the blade up to the handle—it required some force to get it out—besides that she had a lacerated wound, two and a quarter inches long, in the same arm, and two punctured wounds in the back, and a slight wound of the right loin—the wound on the shoulder was not dangerous to life—it was a very severe wound; the others were not so dangerous—she remained there about three weeks—she cannot move her arm very well yet; but she is now pretty well—it must nave required very great force to have inflicted the wound on the shoulder.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sorter in the General Post-Office, and reside at 5, Brunswick-place, City-road, in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch—about 4 o'clock on the morning of 5th July last I was awoke—I jumped out of bed, when I heard a noise and screaming from below—I ran down<lb/>stairs—my son was outside the door—I went to the front door, and saw the prisoner Buckett down in the area—there were several people standing out<lb/>side the front door, and among them I saw King—I am quite certain he was outside the door—this key (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is one of mine—I made in partly myself—it is an old key, and I filed it down to this form—it was in my wife's possession the night previous to the robbery—I cannot swear that I saw her with it—I will swear it is my key.</p>

I am a labourer, living at Elstree, which is close to Brockley-hill—I worked at hay-making at Mr. Partridge's, and the prisoners worked there also for two or three days—on Friday, 1st August, I was dis<lb/>charged, and received my wages at the time—at sunset that day, when it was getting dark, I went to Herrington's public-house, at Brockley-hill—the prisoners were there when I went in—I had a pint of beer, and took out my purse when I paid for it—Williams saw all that was in my purse—I do not know exactly what time I left the public-house, but it was about half-past 10 when I went there—I was not in there more than a few minutes, and then I walked out again—the prisoners followed me out—I was going down to my master's place, and they came out after me, and John Williams said, "Come along," and the three dragged me to a pond there, and knocked me down; I got up, and then John Williams knocked me down again—I got up again, and he said, "If I can't do it, I will stick him with a knife"—I was calling for help, and I was knocked down again—I got no assistance, and John Williams took hold of me by the neck and choked me that I could not speak; the others then took hold of me, one on each side, and he put one hand on my neck, and with the other took all the money out of my pocket, and they all went away—when Williams threatened to use the knife, he took a knife from a case and opened it—he took it out of his trousers pocket—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—during this time the others were kicking me, and I was calling out "Help!" and fighting—the police at Elstree heard me, and were coming down—after being robbed I met with my mate, Patrick Berry—I afterwards met with two police constables—I saw the three prisoners next day at the station—I am sure they are the same three men—I did not go to Mr. Partridge's place since I was robbed.</p>

It it likely I could bend his hand down as he says I did, and have hold of his throat and take his watch all at the same time. Tucker is a perfect stranger to me.</p>

I live at 6, Market-street, and keep an eating-house—on the night of 28th July, or morning of 29th, about 1 o'clock, I saw one of the prisoners about a yard from the cellar flap of the house of Mrs. Tester—I could not swear which prisoner it was, I was on the opposite side—he walked to the cellar flap, it gradually opened; he descended, and it closed again immediately—I immediately ran over, knocked at the door, and told Mrs. Tester, the landlady, what I had seen—I then sent for a policeman, who went down in the cellar, and I kept watch on the cellar flap—he brought up Cooper—he took him to the station and brought back more assistance, and they went down and brought up the other prisoner—I remained at the cellar flap all the time—the cellar flap communicates with the public-house kept by Mrs. Tester.</p>

I spoke to her mother one night to go out and see if she could see her previous to this she had had some sweetmeats and so on in her pocket I looked out of the window and saw her coming out of St. Mary's street; I charged her with it, and she said she had been in the yard, but she also said in her confusion, that what she had, she did not know what it was, she had laid on a step in St. Mary's-street; she afterwards took some more money and gave it to some girls from a ragged school, she was late that night also. I do sincerely hope this young man will be cleared of it; I am the head of the family and am responsible for them. The money spent going over to Ireland was the young man's, as far as I can tell; he received 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. then from his owners as a present, and he got a good deal of money given him by officers of ships. He used to go out with a few envelopes, paper, and black leads, and he has sometimes given us 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at a time; he save us 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. last Christmas, and paid for a dress for his mother and sister.

She made mouths at me, and made use of some bad words, and I own I slapped her twice with my open hand, but I did not knock her down or kick her. Next day she took out a summons against me, and gave me four days—she was well and hearty then, and did not complain of her head. She had a row with a person a week after wards; she was a very quarrelsome woman. She used to keep a place to sell ginger beer, and had a jar of liquor to sell on the sly, when all the public-houses were shut up, and she used to have a lot of girls and young men there at all hours of the night. A week after this happened, a woman threw a milk can at her.</p>

I was with Morrisa, and saw Kelly trying to keep Moyce from going into the field—I went into the field after they had been fighting five or ten minutes, and saw Smith and Moyce fighting—first one acted as second, and then the other—there were two naval reserve men, and Weldon and Cook—I saw him on Cook's knee, or, if he was not on his knee, he was heaving him up—no one was seconding Moyce when I went into the field—when he fell down he got up again—I afterwards saw Kelly come and strive to get him away, and one of the naval reserve men came up and tried to prevent him; and Kelly got hold of him, and said, "Do not let him fight, it is better for you and me to fight than that"—he was drunk, and could not help himself—Moyce was not sitting on Kelly's knee each round—I saw the last round—they got hold of one another, and were striking one another—Moyce fell, and Smith with him; and Smith being the shorter man, when he fell, his head pitched on Moyce's breast, and slid up under his chin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician and surgeon—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination of the deceased, by the Coroner's direction, two days after the death—he was a large, powerful man, nearly six feet high—his body was very much decomposed, and extensively bruised about the shoulders and back—around the scalp of the lower and back part of the head I found a quantity of extravasated blood, and on the surface of the brain a corresponding extra<lb/>vasation, and another extravasation between the bone and its membranes—the skull was not fractured—the head was unnaturally loose on the spine, and the ligaments which connect the cranium with the spine had been damaged—the cause of death was pressure on the junotion of the brain and spinal cord, caused by the extravasation of blood and the loosening of the ligaments—falling heavily would have caused the bruises; but, I believe, the injury to the ligaments of the neck was caused by his falling doubled up in some way, or by some one falling on him when he fell in a half sitting posture—a fall which caused the head to be doubled on the body would do it; if the upper man fell with his chest on the deceased's head, that would have caused it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> After such a fall at you describe at might have caused death, could the man have had another round, if in an intoxicated state? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should say not; I believe this injury occurred in the last fall, which was distinct—it is impossible for me to say whether it might have occurred in a previous fall—it is possible that he might have received the injury and gone on struggling a little longer, but I think not.</p>

I was going to the post-office that morning when I left my house, and I met a young man, who told me he had got a situation at a woollen warehouse in the City. He then had two bags with him, one in front and one behind. He said he had to leave one at Blackfriars-road, and one at Islington. He asked me if I was going home, and I said I should be, shortly, to my breakfast. When I got to the station-house the officer took my money away from me. I told him I had had no breakfast, and he got me some. After asking the man what the goods were, I took them. Knowing the man, I did not know I</p>

Had the officer gone home with me I should have had an opportunity of clearing myself, but by his not going home with me he robbed me of the only chance I had. The man called for the goods, and my wife told him the officer had there and searched the place, and then he made off. Had the officer have gone with me he would have seen the man, but he is prejudiced against me for a certain thing, although he has never had me in trouble before. There was no trying to shift out of any question he put to me. I answered him sharply, and did not try to evade an answer. I think the case is very doubtful, and I beg you will give me the benefit of that doubt.</p>

I reside at Rupert House-terrace—on Friday, 25th July, I fastened the window of my dining-room at about half-past 11 or from that to 12 o'clock at night—I was called down by a servant next morning about a quarter past 6, and found that an entrance had been made at this particular window—I missed from the dining-room some counters, a pair of Balmoral boots, a coat, a cream-ewer, a sugar-basin, and cake-basket—two of these things (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are not mine, but the rest belong to me—the value of the property altogether is, I should say, about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—some of the articles were in use the night before—my house is in the parish of Chiswick—I was the last person up, and barred and bolted the dining-room back window.</p>

I am cook in the service of Mr. Bridges—on Friday night, 25th July, I closed and fastened all the windows and doors, at a little before 11, except the dining-room window—next morning I came down a few minutes after 6, and found the room all in a disorderly state, and the window open—I roused Mr. Bridges directly—the window of the hall back-door was also broken—the dining-room window was the only place at which a person could get in—I found this iron gardening instru<lb/>ment in the dining-room.</p>

               <p>morning, the prisoner came and asked whether we purchased plate—I told him we did sometimes, but I should not buy any of him unless he brought a note from the person to whom it belonged—he went away, and returned in shout a quarter of an hour with this note (<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "James Connell. Sir, please to take the plate, and send a note back by the bearer, J. Council, 7, Marlborough-street, Chelsea.

I live at 4, Queen's-square, Hoxton—I am a painter and am the occupier of the house—on the night of 16th July, I and my family went to bed about half-past 11—the house was quite secured at that time—I fastened it myself—the parlour door was locked and the back window secured by a fastening in the ordinary way—there were no shutters—at about 4 o'clock in the morning I was awakened by the police, and came down into the back kitchen—I found the back window still closed, but a square of glass had been cut out of the half that was close—I found two coats, a clock, and some children's wearing apparel in the middle of the room, packed up—that property belonged to me, and was worth about 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—my house is in the parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch.</p>

Some went one way, and I and two or three others came and stopped at the corner of Essex-street. They went indoors to go to bed, and left me. I lived in Clerkenwell, and I was very tired and sleepy, so I sat down and went to sleep, and all at once I heard the policeman halloo.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge at the White Swan public-house, in Bream's-buildings, Chancery-lane—on Monday, 18th August, about 6 in the after<lb/>noon, I went into the yard at the back of Swan-court, and as I stood there talking with Mrs. Smithies, in the yard of No. 2, Mrs. Chappel came out of one of her tenant's houses and said to me, "Come into this yard, and I will double you up"—I said, "You can't hurt"—she again said, "Come in the yard, and I will double you up, and rip your b—y guts out"—I replied, "Mrs. Chappel, I have too much love to offer to lift a hand against a woman; it may be if you were a man and struck me, I might turn in my own defence"—a few minutes afterwards, a man named Sullivan came out of one of Mrs. Chappel's tenant's house, and offered to fight me—I said, "My good friend, I will have nothing to do with you; I am no fighter; I never did fight in my life"—as soon as that had passed, he and the prisoner rushed into the yard—I was standing with my hands in my pocket, and a short pipe, and Sullivan came up and struck me on the breast—as soon as he struck me, the prisoner came and caught me by my beard—Sullivan then tried to get hold of my hands to fling me back—they dragged me down into the passage of No. 5, Swan-court, and then the prisoner called out for a pair of scissors and said, "Let's murder the b—y b—r"—Sullivan had hold of my neck-tie behind—I was standing then, and the</p>

                  </hi>. I was assistant house-surgeon at King's College Hospital when Leak was brought there on the 18th, between 6 and 7 o'clock—I examined him and found a slight punctured wound on the right eye-brow—I washed it and found there was a very small opening—the upper eyelid was much swollen—had it been half an inch lower it might have caused very severe injury.</p>

I was on the step of my house, when a message was brought to me, that Leak was at the back doing a great deal of damage. I went to the back and he made his way into my yard; I then asked him how he came to commit the depredations he had on my premises; he told me that he came thinking my b—y husband would come out to fight him; I told him Mr. Chappel was not at home, and I wished for no quarrelling; he then said, "Bring any other man;" Mr. Sullivan then came round and said, "Why do you want to quarrel with her?" Leak then said, "Will you fight me?" Sullivan said, "Yes;" and they took</p>

               <p>their jackets off. I, not wishing to see Mr. Sullivan got into trouble, placed myself between them, and immediately I did so, the man Leak struck me upon my breast and I fell. I did not strike him at all."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a labourer, living at Hairbrain-court, Royal Mint-street, Whitechapel—I knew the prisoner when I had my eyesight—she lives nearly opposite me, in the same court—last Saturday three weeks, I came home into the court between 9 and 10 o'clock at night—I found there was some disturbance in the court, and I walked out again—when I last came home I found the prisoner's mother and my wife having a few words—I walked in-doors and told my wife to fetch me out a chair; she did so, and I sat down and was unlacing my boots, and the prisoner's mother came over, struck me twice in the face, spat in my face, and called me a blind bastard—I shoved her away from me, and while so doing, and getting up from my chair, the prisoner threw a jug or bason, I cannot say exactly which, and struck me on the breast—I was crossing over to run after her when my wife, or some other woman, laid hold of me and detained me—during that time the prisoner, I believe, ran up stairs and fetched down another missile—she struck me over the forehead with it, and out a small gash over my eye, say<lb/>ing, "There, I'll blind you if I can't do nothing else"—I wrenched myself from my wife's hands, and from the other persons, and ran after the prisoner—her mother and sister were standing at the door, and they detained me from running after her; and while I was wrangling and <hi rend="italic">jawing</hi> with them, she ran down again, jumped down the steps, and gouged me in the eye with</p>

               <p>some small instrument, a key or something, I could not tell what it was—I directly cried out, "My eye is out"—two of the neighbours laid hold of me, led me in-doors, and detained me there till they fetched a police-constable; they gave the prisoner in charge, and two of the neighbours led me up to the police-station, and I gave the charge, and from there they took me to the London Hospital—I lost the sight of my right-eye three years ago last September—I did not strike the prisoner or do anything to her—I did not know at the time that she was in the court; I do not believe she was, at the time the quarrel was going on with my wife.</p>

I live at 3, White-yard, Royal Mint-street, White<lb/>chapel—I was in Hairbrain-court, between 12 and 1 o'clock, on this Sunday morning; and, seeing a disturbance between the prisoner's mother and Harris, I went and said, "Harris, you had better go in-doors"—I took him in-doors and he sat down for about five minutes, and then came out again—the prisoner then came and said, "I will give it you"—she ran up stairs, fetched something down, I cannot say what, and chucked it at Harris—she went up stairs again, fetched down a jug or basin, or whatever it might be, and caught him over the eye—I saw that, and saw him bleed from the eye after it—I heard something fall on the ground, as if from his face—he seemed to be quite sober.</p>

I am the wife of Charles Barnard, of 9, Hanover-street, Bermondsey—I was accompanying my sister over London-bridge on the 10th, and saw her take hold of a man's arm, and saw him run across the road—it was the prisoner—I called out for police—the prisoner ran, and the police ran after him—I saw his face—he is the man the police ran after, the same man who had his hand in my sister's pocket.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">Policeman, C</hi> 137). On 16th July last, about 12 o'clock, from information I received, I went to the house of Mr. Palmer, 6A, West-street, Soho—I went down into the back-yard to the dust-hole, and there found this ingot of tin nearly covered with dust—I could just discern one end of it—I concealed myself in a cellar something similar to a wine or coal-cellar—I remained there till about 1 or half-past, when the prisoner Still and another man not in custody came down to the dust-hole with a basket and shovel—the other man reached over into the dust-hole, and took</p>

               <p>out the ingot of tin, and put it into the basket—Still was close to him at that time—he could see the ingot put in—he had the shovel in his hand, and he filled the basket with dust, and helped it on to the other man's back—he took it up stairs, came down again, took up one more basket full of dust, and then both left—they went into Litchfield-street, close by, and took away some more dust—I followed them round into another street, where the other man, not in custody, and Still, both got up into the cart, wrapped the ingot up in some old dirty pieces of rag that they had picked out of the dust, and put it into a sack or bag—they then finished their load there, and went away both together—I and Ewell, a foreman of the firm, followed them to the corner of Upper Ground-street, Blackfriar's-road—I was in plain clothes—the cart stopped there, and Still took the sack from the cart, and went to 35, Upper Ground-street, the prisoner Barker's shop—he went into the shop, and went through into the back-parlour—I remained there a minute or so—another man, neither of the prisoners, came out of the shop—I stopped him, and asked what he had—we both went back into the shop together—the two prisoners were there in the back-parlour together—I asked Still what he had done with the piece of tin which he had just brought in—he said he knew nothing of it whatever; he did not know what I meant—I then asked Barker if he was the man belonging to the shop—he said "Yes"—I asked him for the piece of tin that the other man had just brought in—he said he knew nothing of it; he had not seen any<lb/>thing—(I had told him I was a constable)—I said I was quite sure he had brought it there, for I had hardly lost sight of him since he took it from the house where it came from—Barker replied that he knew nothing of it whatever—I said I should search the house for it, for I was quite sure it was there—I went through into the back-parlour, where both prisoners had just come from, and in amongst a lot of rags, piled up in separate lots, just between the partition of one pile from the other, this piece of tin was put, a few inches under the rags—it was not in the sack in which I had seen it—Still had the sack in his hand when he came out of the parlour.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boiler-maker, of Bell and Anchor-cottages, Victoria-docks—on the night of 30th June, about half-past 11 o'clock, I was in company with a friend, named George Dent, in the Victoria Dock-road, and observed a party of Russian seamen on before me—I afterwards saw five more seamen, Americans, come up, and one of them went in among the other seamen, who were on before me—I had seen the Americans in public-houses on former occasions, all five of them—the prisoner is one of them—I have seen him with his comrades—he went from his party to the party before, and then returned to his four mates—the party of Russians then set off to run, and the American party followed them—Dent and I ran on with the Americans, and while I was running I saw the prisoner running about fifteen yards before his own mates, with a knife in his hand—one of the Russian sailors was left by himself; and I saw the prisoner plunge the knife into him—I had left Dent behind, and I then turned and went back to him—the prisoner made the plunge with something in his hand which glittered; I cannot say whether it was a knife or not—I had seen the man, at whom he made the plunge, that night at the publican's</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186208180128"/>
               <p>house—when I returned to my mate, the prisoner was returning to his mates, and, as he was coming past me, I saw this thing glitter in his hand, as he was putting it into the breast of his shirt, and pointed it out to Dent—I then touched the prisoner on his shoulder, and told him not to run away—he walked about five yards past me and then set off running to his mates, and I lost sight of him for that night—about two hours afterwards I went to the Bell and Anchor public-house, close by where I live, and saw the same Russian, at whom the prisoner made the plunge, lying on the table—Harris, the policeman was there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Was it the noise that these people were making in the public road that attracted your attention? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—there was a bustling and talking among the Russians when the American was in among them; a noise; loud talking—I was about five or six yards from the party of Russians when I heard this—it was half-past 11 o'clock at night—the noise was not from the whole party of Russians and Americans; the party of six were behind—the prisoner's mates were ten or twelve yards from the Russians at that time—the whole body of the Americans did not overtake the Russians, but the prisoner only overtook one man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. LILLEY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In the first instance when the Russians were before and the Americans behind, did anybody but the prisoner run? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; the five ran, and the four Americans were left in the rear the same as my mate—he was not with them, or next to them—I cannot tell the distance he was from them, because I was running before them—when I saw the prisoner put something glittering in his shirt, he said, "I have done for that b—r."</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> As he passed you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Just as he passed us; he was setting off to run away—the American party followed the Russians—the prisoner's mates were all together then, but they were either frightened to follow, or they could not run fast enough—he outstripped them, and got fifteen yards before them—he and I ran side by side and outstripped the others—I did not say that at the time I saw this thing in his hand, he was fifteen yards a-head of his mates—I said that I could not look round behind to see how far behind they were, but I said that the man was fifteen yards off us when I saw the thing in his hand—his mates might have been close behind him—he and I were running side by side—the man who the prisoner overtook, and made a plunge at, was left behind by the rest of his party—he was standing still—his face was towards me—I just merely ran to see what would come of it—to see whether there would be any fighting—I ran after the Russians with the Americans.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">JURY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the Russian turned round towards the American, did he show any menace towards the American, or were there any words between them? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you sure he did not turn his face in order to make a stand against the Americans? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Well, I cannot say what he meant to do—I did not take notice of his gestures—I saw nothing in his appearance to lead me to form an opinion why he turned round and presented his face towards his pursuers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boiler-smith, and lived at Bell and Anchor-cottages on 30th June—I was with Taylor that night in Victoria Dock-road, and saw a cargo of Russian sailors going down the road before us—when we got a little way down the road, five American sailors came alongside of us—the prisoner was one of them—he left his four mates and went amongst the former crew, the Russians, and a disturbance commenced amongst them; a noise, and in a short time the prisoner returned to his four mates—the</p>

               <p>Russians stood still during the time the prisoner was among them—they were walking on; but when he went among them they immediately stopped—the Russian party were at that time, as near as I could judge, about eight yards from the American party—when the prisoner returned to his four mates, the Russians ran away immediately, and the Americans ran after them—the prisoner was with the other four, all running together, and I and Taylor ran with them—I did not observe who was first among the Americans—as the Americans ran, I saw the prisoner turn from the man who was stabbed—I was the last one who got up—the prisoner was then about three yards from me—he had a weapon of some description in his hand—I saw it glitter, and I saw him put it in his bosom—he called to his mates to stop; and, as he went up to them, he said, "I have done for the b—r"—I was not near enough to see whether the Russian was in any threatening attitude—the prisoner and the other Americans ran away in another direction from the Russians—I had not known the Russian before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did not some other man besides the prisoner rush up among the Russians just before the stab? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not see any other man—I was not near enough to see—he could not have got away without my seeing it—another man might have struck him without my seeing it—Prentice was there that night; he was one of the five Ameri<lb/>can sailors—he had returned before Brennan returned—he had come back to his mates before the prisoner; I am sure of that—I did not see Prentice among the Russians—I saw him coming from them—that was just before I saw the prisoner coming away—a great many sailors wear knives; almost all seafaring men do.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What light was there at this time that you could see by? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Gas-light—there are not a great many lamps about there—you could not see for any great distance, not with the light there was—when the prisoner put the thing that glittered into his bosom his mates were before him—they had returned from the Russians, and were running back towards the railway crossing, in a different direction to the Russians—they began to run back before I got up to the man that was stabbed, before I saw the prisoner turn from the Russian—I know of no reason why they began to run—they were running after the Russians at first—I saw no reason for their running back again—I did not see them turn—they were about six or eight yards from the Russian that was killed when I saw them returning back again, but the other Russians were further—the rest of the Americans were about five yards before the prisoner when I saw him turn from the man that was stabbed.</p>

               <p>twenty minutes past 11, I was on duty in the Victoria Dock-road—I heard cries of "Murder" and "Police"—I saw a great crowd of persons in the Victoria Dock-road, and I saw a man running away—I could not tell who the man was at that time, or what occupation he followed—I afterwards saw a Russian sailor at the Bell and Anchor—I did not see him on the road—I ascertained his name from the chief mate; it was Stephen Kossorokoff—I called in the assistance of Dr. Banks—he temporarily bound up his wounds, and I took him to the Poplar Hospital—the deceased did not give me any description of the person who had inflicted the injury upon him—as I went to the Bell and Anchor I inquired of the persons standing round, and I received a description from the witness Taylor—in consequence of informa<lb/>tion, I apprehended the prisoner at half-past 5 next morning, on board the ship <hi rend="italic">Fanny Fern,</hi> lying in Victoria Dock—I took him to the Poplar Hospital, about 8 o'clock that morning; took him to the bedside of the wounded man, and he at once identified him—he pointed to him—I could not understand his language, he being a Russian—he could speak a word or two of English—I had Prentice in custody besides the prisoner—he was also taken with the prisoner to the deceased's bedside—he made gestures, and pointed to his breast, as if Prentice had assaulted him as well, beat him, or held his arms—I distinctly asked him two or three times about the short man, and he said, "Short man no knife;" and then he moved his arms about on his breast, as much as to say he had struck him with his fists—he pointed to Prentice, and said, "Short man no knife"—Prentice is not so high in stature as the prisoner—he had pointed to the prisoner before that—as soon as ever the prisoner came into the room he pointed to him at once—I was present on 25th July, when the deceased's deposition was taken by Mr. Reeves, a gentleman from Essex—the prisoner was present at the time—he had the opportunity of cross-examination, and he did cross-examine—the deposition was taken down in writing, and signed by the Magistrate.</p>

I am a carpenter living near Plaistow Marsh—on the night of 22d July, about 11 o'clock, I went, in company with a son of the prosecutor, to the premises, to look around and see if all was right—there is a gateway by the side of the house at the back—I saw a man standing there—I saw him move his elbow, as though giving a signal, which raised my suspicion that something was wrong—I went for a policeman, leaving the prosecutor's son on the premises—I met a policeman just outside, and he went with me to the back part of the premises—I got on the fence there and saw several men about—the policeman got over the paling at the bottom—I stayed by the premises—the policeman had a struggle with a man down below, not on the premises—I went and met three dock constables, and they came back with me.</p>

I keep a beer-shop in Mount-street, Bolt-fields, Wool<lb/>wich—on Sunday evening, 27th July, about 6 or 7 o'clock, Abrahams and another marine came in with a sailor and two civilians—the two marines were dressed alike—they asked for a pot of ale which came to sixpence, and Abrahams gave me a half-crown—I gave him a two shilling-piece change—I put the half-crown in the till where there was some small silver, but no half-crowns—they went up stairs and sat some time, and in about ten minutes they went away—after they had gone some little time I discovered the half-crown to be bad, and put it in my pocket—I am sure it was the same half-crown—no one had been to my till in the meanwhile—there was only some small silver in my pocket—I marked the half-crown at the back of the head, and kept it till the following Friday, when I gave it to Martin, a policeman—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is it—both the men had light coloured trousers; they had tunics, not jackets, and hats, which I believe they call shakos.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. CHAMBERS</hi>, Q.C. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> A very important question was asked you, which you answered incidentally, as to whether you knew Mr. Williams before he entered into business on his own account? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We did two years previously—our firm then consisted of my father, myself, and my brother Samuel—when I became acquainted with Williams, he was in the employ of Page and Welch, leather factors, of Bishopsgate-street, as one of their leather warehousemen—I know Mr. Page—he is in Court—my brother Samuel ceased to be a member of the firm on January 1st, 1860—as a leather salesman, or agent, Page had sold leather to our firm—I cannot say whether we owed Page and Welch a debt of 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I should certainly say it was 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it exceeded 3,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. by some hundreds, but at this distance of time it is impossible to fix it to a few hundreds—it was for leather he had sold for us, and for raw goods as well—I should think the leather was about 1,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the raw goods about 2,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—of course I am not fixed to a hundred or two—we paid every farthing of it—in the panic of 1857 we had an extension of time, and at that time we owed Messrs. Page and Welch only 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the debt afterwards increased to 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. when Mr. Williams was with them, and then we reduced it—Mr. Williams left in 1857—our debt at that time was, I should think, much less than 3,500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but it is impos<lb/>sible for me to swear it without reference to books, if I had my books here, I could give you the exact figures—Page and Welch insisted on our diminishing that debt—that was, I should think after Williams left—they never mentioned his name to us at all, nor do I think he complained to us that he had been spoken to, for trusting us to so large an amount—when he started in business, we introduced him to the London and Westminster Bank, where we kept our account—before he went into business, we told him most distinctly that we would support him—he went down to Leeds after he left, Page and Welch, and we corresponded as friends, and promised him our support—I never used to go down and see him—he set up in business in 1858—I do not recollect any service he did us before he set up in business—he did not give us letters of introduction to houses in Glasgow and else<lb/>where—I will swear he did not introduce us to firms there—he was with the firm of Richard Mitchell, large tanners, near Leeds—he never intro<lb/>duced us to them, and we never had a transaction with them—we had not introductions to a firm at Glasgow to my knowledge—I do not know whether my father is here—he is my partner—he did not refuse to prosecute—I consider him as a prosecutor—I have never been to Glasgow—my father went there, and we had a transaction with John Slater, and lost money—I</p>

               <p>was at Margate at the time—it was in August, 1858 and Williams set up in October—my father was at Glasgow two or three days—he went to Leeds, and from Leeds to Glasgow—Williams was very intimate with my family—he came and stopped at my father's house before he set up in business—he and his family were at our house three or four months, and then they started when they had got a house and furnished it—I believe my father is not here—he assists me in managing the business, and is a very active man—he appeared at the police-court—he has never given evidence—Williams came up to town with the express intention of starting in business, and my father assisted him in finding a place, and was very active—long before this circular was sent, Williams and I had conversations about his doing business for us—it was our custom to draw bills on him before the goods were actually sold, but I cannot tell whether that was mooted before the circular was sent—I never proposed to him that he should accept accom<lb/>modation-bills for us, nor did my father—my father never accepted bills, and never drew them—I drew the bills—the arrangement in the trade is, that we can draw for two-thirds of the value of the goods—that arrange<lb/>ment was never put in writing—it was no privilege at all—it is the custom of the trade—if we drew a bill at two months, and the goods were not sold for six months, we always gave him the money to meet his bill, to recoup himself—I am aware that he started in business with no capital; in fact, our object in drawing on him, was to give him the benefit of our money in effecting sales—we were to draw, and he was to accept, before the goods were sold—there is no such thing as a maximum price.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In one of these there is "At 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 8<hi rend="italic">d.;"</hi> that is maximum and minimum, is it not? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The instance you refer to is the N. S. W.; it is 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that was specific on one amount—it is 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to 18<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if he returned us 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., that would not do—if he only got 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., we should be satisfied—if he returned us 17<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but not if he got more—if the customer turned out bad, he was to lose the money, so that he had to look out to see that it was a sound customer—I perfectly remember, in September, 1859, a transaction of a number of Petersburg kips, at 21<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—I have not been brushing up my memory, I recollect that transaction thoroughly—I did not tell him to take them, and render account sales, so as to secure the transaction; the goods were sold out and out to him, and an invoice sent with them—there have been no proceedings whatever in the Bankruptey Court—what makes me recollect toe transaction is, that they were the only goods we ever tanned, and it was our largest parcel—it was an experiment—we do not tan generally such light goods—Mr. Williams had a sample, and sold some, he had the prospect of selling them all, and he bought the parcel out and out—I know it was 17th September, because I was going to Margate the same day; it was Saturday—it was as long ago as 1859—we did not require him to return account sales of those Petersburgs before he sold them—I will swear that—I do not know when the whole of the goods were sold to him, and I never had any interest to know—I do not know that they were eighteen months before they were sold; I never inquired—I am quite up in this transaction; it was an out and out purchase of the goods—the whole were sold to him as an experiment; but he had some first—he had the first lot, it might be two or three weeks prior to the sale; it was in summer time—we first sent about ten dozen to him as a sample to Messrs. Brooksbank—he suc<lb/>ceeded in selling them, and we never consigned him any more—he sold them, and then he bought the whole bulk, and the whole were invoiced to</p>

               <p>him—he had very nearly 2,000—I have come into possession of all his papers—I have not looked for any paper in which these Petersburgs were invoiced to him—I have not heard before of the statement he has made that that transaction was as a factor—I did not recollect this suddenly—I, of course, knew what you meant when you referred to the transaction—I cannot say what the amount of his sale was, without looking at his ledger, or my own books; they are in Court—I have no doubt that it was somewhere about 557<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was a large transaction—we allowed him three months' credit—it was paid by bills—I have not got my bill-book here—he was made a bank<lb/>rupt at the end of February this year—I was chosen trade assignee at the end of March—the other assignee was Samuel Barclay, a leather-dresser—the charge at the police-court was made in May, two months after his bankruptcy—Mr. Barclay consented to my making the charge—I know that Mr. Barclay is dead—I swear that he did not refuse to prosecute—he was ill when he was chosen assignee—he was taken to a sick bed and died, and I never came in contact with him, and never consulted him—I went before a Magistrate to get a warrant against Williams on Saturday night; and, I believe, instructions were given that he was not to be apprehended till Sunday—I heard that he was apprehended on Saturday evening—he was taken before the Magistrate on Monday morning—he was not living with his wife and children; he was up at Islington, and his wife was living with her friends—that was after he had become bankrupt, and I and the other assignee had taken possession of his property—I appeared there on Monday—the charge was dismissed three weeks afterwards—I went before the Magistrate three times—Mr. Knights was called as one of my witnesses—he was a customer of Williams—part of the consignment of 23d August is not sold to William Knights; it is to Leonard Harriss; nor is it so in the consignment book.</p>

CHAMBERS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Is that the Mr. Knights who was examined as a witness for you before the Police-Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—we have not taken his case at all to-day—we have not subpoenaed him here to-day, and do not want him—I believe he is an absconding bankrupt—I heard him examined before the Magistrate—there is risk in a factor trusting a customer, but not very great risk—it depends upon how a man conducts his business—difi<lb/>culties in the leather-trade arose in 1860—there was no more risk in trusting people after the leather panic than before—a great many people became bankrupt then—we did not suspend, nor was there any danger of it—we got an extension of time in 1857, and paid everybody in full—I was excessively intimate with Williams's family—he had a daughter—I never made a pro<lb/>posal of marriage to her—I will swear that she did not refuse me, or treat me with coldness and dismiss me; what an absurdity!—I was not paying attentions to her, nor did Williams tell me to cease doing so—she is now married—my intimacy with the Williams's ceased at the time of the bank<lb/>ruptcy—Williams has not told me that he did not like the attentions I was paying to his daughter; she was married two years before—Williams has never been examined before the Commissioners in Bankruptcy—we caused him to be taken in custody in May—there was an adjournment to prepare accounts—I had looked through the accounts, but I had good advice; Messrs. Paul and Turner assisted me—I caused Williams to be taken in custody a week or two before the adjournment day—Mr. Paul is here—the purchasers whose names I have given are all here; Thomas Simeon, James Gidden, Alexander Macleod, Eaton, Harriss, and Smerdon—they were not all before the Magis<lb/>trate</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In 1858, I understand there was a slight deviation in the terms? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; we were to pay cartage—that was perhaps twelve months afterwards—that was never reduced into writing, but it was a matter privately understood between us and Williams—although there was a bankruptcy, I took no opportunities of examining Balch or Williams, for special reasons—we did not learn that we could not make out any indictable offence against Williams, unless we included Balch—one party advised one course, and one another—we had two or three courses submitted to us—we were told that we should not have so good a chance of convicting Williams unless we included Balch in the indictment—I was told that it would help me to introduce Balch into it; but I should most dis<lb/>tinctly have done so without that—I swear that—I believe there is no separate indictment against Williams—I may take my solicitors' statement, and say that there is not.</p>

GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after you became assignee did you inspect the books? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Immediately; and I had not been at them an hour, before I discovered a fraud; and I informed the solicitor to the bankruptcy, Mr. Linklater, and afterwards applied to my present solicitor, Mr. Humphreys, and in his company took the advice of Counsel, and acted by his advice—the variation in the terms was, that we were to pay cartage, the same as others—the London factors charged about 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a ton, which we consented to, and paid on the subsequent account sales—when I called it private, it may have been mentioned in conversation between us; he may have said, "I find that Poppleton and Beer are paying those charges," and we consented—Mr. Barclay was ill when he was appointed, and never acted in the matter; he did not even appear in Court to sign the paper; he died about six weeks afterwards—he never to my knowledge expressed any disapproval of the course I was pursuing; nor did I ever hear that suggested till to-day—they have not appointed another yet—Williams knew that we had the Petersburg kips—we sent him down a sample, with which he was so pleased that he bought the whole lot—it was a purchase out and out—the amount was paid by acceptances, which were drawn and paid on their becoming due—Miss Wil<lb/>liams has been married two years, and our firm continued to deal with Williams down to the date of his bankruptcy—I never heard till to-day any suggestion of their discontinuing to deal with us on account of the coldness of the lady—my father was at the police-court—there is no truth in the suggestion that he disapproved of this prosecution; he decidedly pays part of the expense of it, and not only he, but the other creditors—I am not aware of his having been introduced at Leeds or Glasgow by Williams, or of any arrangement by which my father was to draw bills, which the prisoner was to accept for my father's accommodation: it is impossible—every penny of our debt to Page and Welch was paid years ago—we stopped payment in 1857; we procured an extension of time, as we could not realize stock during the panic—we prayed for four, eight, twelve, and eighteen months—we did not pay interest; we were not asked—I do not know where Mr. Knights is now—he was bankrupt, and his examination was adjourned <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi>—I did not interfere with the execution of the warrant, or give instructions one way or other—our goods shrink according to the weather, and there is sometimes a difference in the weight—they absorb moisture very readily, and, therefore, they afterwards recover their weight again.</p>
