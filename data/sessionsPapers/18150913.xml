               <p>SARAH COLLIS. I was a lodger with the deceased, who lived in <placeName id="t18150913-1-crimeloc3">Short's-gardens, Drury-lane</placeName>

I knew her for the last fourteen years; for the last two years, she has cohabited with the prisoner. In consequence of a quarrel between the son of the deceased and the prisoner, relative to their cohabitation, it was agreed that the prisoner should take separate lodgings; which he accordingly did, in Queen-street. On Tuesday morning, the 20th of June, the prisoner at the bar called at the lodgings of the deceased, and inquired if she was at home. I told him, she was not; and he asked me if I would have some gin. We went to the Two Spies public-house, and while we were drinking there, he said, " it would be blood for blood."</p>
               <p>Q. In allusion to what, was that - A. I understood it to be relating to the quarrel between the deceased's son, and himself; for there was ill blood between them. When we went over to the lodgings again, the deceased was come; and the prisoner being intoxicated, requested permission of the deceased to lie down on the bed, to sober himself, that he might go to work the next morning, and she gave him leave. He layed down, and in about half an hour, he got up, and asked for his razors, saying, Bet, I shall take them away, for fear of the boy; meaning a son of the deceased's. He remained in the room until five in the afternoon. We were then at tea, and he expressed a wish for some gin. I accordingly got a penny, and went for a pennyworth of gin, and mixed it with a basin of tea, which I gave him, and which he drank. After that, he took a knife out of his pocket, and threw it on the ground, damming it, and saying, it was of no use. He remained in the room a while longer, and then pulled out his pension ticket, and threw it into the fire. I snatched it out, and gave it to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by his pension ticket - A. He had been a sailor; and this was the ticket by which he procured his pension. He remained in the room until a little after six o'clock; and then he took a penny, and went over the way for some gin, without his shoes; and returned immediately. Presently afterwards, he wanted to go home; and the deceased said, you had better stop a little, until it is dark, least you should see my son John. The prisoner then sat down behind the door, and he had something in his hand; and some blood fell from his hand. I did not know what it was that was in his hand. I told the deceased, (who was close to him working,) to mind that no blood fell on the work; she was working at Army work, making soldiers coats. She then went to the other end of the room; and he went out, and called her. She said, she would come presently; and he told her to come immediately, and he would not keep her a minute. She went, and after having been gone about ten minutes, she returned for a piece of lace to tie up his trowsers, which were loose, on account of his braces having been broken. I gave her the lace, together with a handkerchief of his; with which she went down stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her any more alive - A. No, I did not. When I saw her again, it was in about five minutes, at the foot of the kitchen stairs, with her feet up four steps, and her head on the stones. I lifted her up, and her head fell right back on my arm; it was only held to her body by a bit, (Here the witness explained the breadth of the integument, as equel to the length of the fore finger.) I immediately ran to the gate, and called murder.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She has foresworn herself. I never sat behind the door, nor ever had the razor in my hand.</p>
               <p>Witness. I did not say he had the razor in his hand. I could not distinguish what was in his hand.</p>

            , and for the last two years and two months, she cohabited with the prisoner, At about half past six o'clock in the evening of the 20th of June, 1815, the prisoner came into the deceased's lodgings, and asked her permission to lie on the bed, to sober himself, in order that he might go to work the next morning. He layed down behind the bed for about two hours, and then he got up again, and wanted some gin. Mrs. Collins went, and got him some. In the evening he drank tea with us; and after he layed down, he was quise sober. He walked backwards and forwards, up and down the room several times, with something in his hand. He finally left the room at seven o'clock; he then called Mr. Beesemore, the deceased, out of the room, and said, he wanted to speak with her; she went to him; and came in directly. She went to him on the landing place, and then came back to go on with the loops of the jacket, which she was working. He called her again, and she went; and on returning again in about ten minutes; she took with her to him some lace and his handkerchief, and went back again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see her alive again - A. No, I did not. The next time I saw her was in about five minutes, with her head on the stones, at the bottom of the stairs, her feet up four steps and her head early severed from her body.</p>

               <p>"nobody but myself robbed my master." I then said, what have you done with the money. He had previously asked me whether it would be better for him to tell all; and I told him, that was a question I could not answer, for it was with the magistrates. He then told me to tell Armstrong, to go to his father's house, and on a shelf in the chimney, he would find ninety pounds rolled up in a piece of parchment. He said, that some of the notes had been lost out of his waistcoat pocket.</p>

I called my master at five o'clock in the morning of the 25th, and he went into the cellar. I saw the state of the window the night before, and it was safe; it was tried, but I was not present. I opened the casement the night before, to admit the air; the bar was then fast. I then went into the laundry, and missed the ironing cloths. The laundry is about two yards from the dwelling-house. I had been in the laundry the night before, and saw the ironing clothes, and a pair of sheets; and at five o'clock in the morning, I missed them. They were worth ten shillings at least.</p>

I purchased some articles from the prisoner at the bar, about two months ago; I saw him at a public-house in my neighbourhood one morning; there was lot a of victuals laying on a table, and the people all round were eating of them. I asked him, if they were to be sold; and he said, yes, and I should have them all very reasonable; there was a piece of cooked beef, and a piece of uncooked, a quartern loaf, a piece of cheese, and half of another quartern loaf; these things were in a basket, but that, he did not sell. I bought all for six or seven shillings. I conveyed the victuals in the basket to my place. He told me on my enquiring of him, that he knew an old house-keeper who used to save broken victuals for him, and used to give him several old things about the house; and the next day he was to go, and fetch some old pieces of blankets. He brought me the blankets by agreement the next day, and some old sheets; and I bought them of him. The basket he left till he came again, for he said, he must take it back again to the house-keeper. When I was asked a few days go, I gave up all I had.</p>

I immediately went down stairs, and called one of the lodgers; but he refused to get up, and so I went myself; and then the one that was on the watch, ran away; and on going into the house, I found the prisoner behind the door, hiding himself; he had nothing about him but the ink-stand; the knives and the other things were packed up inside, ready to be brought out; some part of the printed cotton was in his hat, and some in his trowsers. I took him to my own house, and locked him up in my room until I had put my clothes on. I knocked at Smith's door, to see if any body lived there; and afterwards I saw Smith, when he returned home from the country with his milk, about six o'clock. I gave the things I found on the prisoner to the constable.</p>

After that, she asked me if I had ever tasted turtle soup; I answered, no. She promissed she would bring me some. I knew her by her frequently coming to purchase articles in my father's shop, and always understood she was Lady Say or Seles servant. She left the print she had bought on the counter, without paying for it, and went as I thought for the soap. I never missed any thing until the next day, when my father missed a piece of cotton print, and spoke to me about it. I had not particularly noticed that piece to have been in the place where she stooped down.</p>

            . I am an officer. I searched the prisoner's lodgings, at No. 14, Shuldam-street. Mr. Walker had got some information that she was there, and having procured a search warrant delivered it to me to execute. When I went to her lodgings, she was at home. I found these two pieces, (producing two pieces of cotton,) in the room in which she was sitting. Mr. Walker had gone in first and said something to her. I asked her if she had any more: the woman of the house said, that she had got six yards of her, and was to give her eighteen pence a yard for it, to make a gown. I took this piece (producing another piece.) out of the woman of the house's premises. Then the prisoner said, that her landlady did not buy it of her, but took it in lieu of rent. Mr. Walker asked the prisoner what she had done with the remainder; and she said she had sent it into the country. I then took her to the office.</p>

            . I am a linen-draper, residing in Blanford-street. A piece of cotton was missing from my shop on the morning of Thursday, the 22nd of June, it contained twenty-eight yards, and stood with others against an iron pillar in the centre of the shop. I was not at home on the day previous, when the prisoner came to my shop; we had in general understood that she was a servant of Lady Say and Sele, but on enquiry, we found she was not. Subsequently I was informed by my boy, that he saw her taking in milk at 14, Shuldam-street. I accordingly got a warrant and went there with an officer; I found her sitting in the window at work, with a piece of cotton in her own hands, but not the whole piece. I asked her how she came by it; and her reply was, that she bought it. She then said, she had bought a piece of print at my house, and was coming for it. I said to her, Melina, you did not bring the turtle soup to my daughter; and I then put my head out of the window, and beckoned to the constable. She then gave us part of the print, and the constable asked her if there was any more, and we got some from the woman of the house, to whom she said, she had given it in the place of rent. We got all three pieces, and they are all parts of one piece, which was the one I lost. These pieces has my shop mark upon it, and I saw it in the shop the day before I missed it.</p>

               <p>JOHN ARMSTRONG. I am an officer. On Wednesday, the 28th of June, I apprehended the other prisoner, in Crooked Village-yard, Kingsland-road. She said, she knew what I took her for, it was for the shawl. I then took from her hand, a small screw box, with a duplicate for the shawl in question, in it, and it appeared by that, to have been pawned for one shilling and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Powell's Defence. We met this woman, and asked her for some gin, and she gave us the shawl to pawn to get some.</p>
               <p>Kelly's Defence. I will leave it to the mercy of the court.</p>

            . I lost some bank notes on Saturday, the 2nd of September. I went into the Black Horse that night, and called for a pot of beer; shortly afterwards, the prisoner came in, and sat on the other side. I treated him, until at length, the landlady would not let us have any more liquor. The prisoner then called me out, and asked me as a countryman, to come, and eat a bit of supper with him. I went with him to his lodgings, but I don't know in what street they are; and there was a girl there; we had supper, and when I had finished mine, I wished to go, but the prisoner held me back three or four times, and said, I should not go yet; I then kicked violently at the door, and cried out murder; and then he took me by the other shoulder, and hit me in the face; he then took his knife out, and cut the handkerchief which was round my neck, and took three one-pound notes out of it. I am sure they were in it. I came on shore that day, at Tower-hill, from on board the Menelaus frigate, and had received the notes from Captain

            . I immediately ran out then, and went for a watchman, and found three in about half an hour. I brought them to the door of the house, but they would not break it open, as it was locked. I soon after, saw the prisoner in a cook's shop, and then I called some watchman again, and when he came out, they attempted to take him, but he made his way through the whole of them. He was taken on the Sunday afterwards.</p>

            . I am a drover. I was at Holloway on Monday morning, the 13th of August, at about seven o'clock; I saw the prisoner driving the sheep through Holloway while I was taking a pint of beer. I asked him if he wanted any person to help him to drive them, and he agreed to my assisting him. Going along, he said, he was going to Smithfield. I asked him whose sheep these were, and he said, they were his own, and he was a farmer, at Bowden Green, below Northampton, from whence he had brought them. I asked him, who was his salesman at Smithfield, and he said, he had no one in particular; I recommended Mr. Ealand to him, and he agreed to him. When we came to Smithfield, I spoke to Mr. Ealand, and he spoke to the prisoner, and entered the sheep into his book. In about an hour and a half, the officers came in search of the prisoner, and he was taken at the Fortune of War public house.</p>

            . I am a Smithfield salesman. Application was made to me by the last witness to seel these sheep, on the morning of Monday, the 13th of August; I was introduced to the prisoner, who told me that they were his own, and he was a farmer, at Bowden Green, below Northampton. I asked him if he was a dealer in sheep, and he said, no. He said, that there were six score; they were all marked J. L. I asked him his name, and he said, it was Wright. He then asked me if I was a regular salesman? I told him, I was; and he said, very well, he should put the stock in my hands, and I must do the best I could for him.</p>

            , ESQ. After I had received information of the loss of my sheep, I went up to Smithfield immediately, and we took the prisoner at about eleven o'clock at the Fortune of War public-house.

            . On searching him, I found a paper, and asked him from that, if he did not live at Redburn, and he said, he did, and had worked with several farmers there. I then asked him if his name was not Draper, and he said, it was. I asked him what was his reason for taking so many sheep; his answer was, that as " he was determined to be hanged, he might as well be hanged for the whole flock, as for two or three. He said, he had shortly before come out of Hertford gaol, where he was imprisoned for three years before, for sheep stealing. I then took him to Guildhall.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. If there had been twice as many more, I should have taken them, for I was quite insane at that time. About sixteen years ago, I was bitten by a mad dog, and was dipped in the salt water at Gravesend for it, and I am always insane in the months of July and August. I really do not know how I came by these sheep at all.</p>

               <p>JAMES ARCHER. I saw the prisoner, and a lad, standing at Mr. Pullen's door, at about half past seven in the evening, of the 15th of August, and presently I saw the lad take a piece of printed cotton, which was standing on the threshold of the door, half in, and half out, and deliver it to the prisoner at the bar. They immediately ran up the court, and I pursued them, and laid hold of the prisoner, who had the cotton, and had thrown his apron over it. Just at the end of the court, I met a man, who assisted me in securing the prisoner; and the lad got away. We then opened the apron, and took the prisoner to Mr. Pullen, who claimed the cotton. The prisoner said, he was employed by some person, whom he did not know, to carry the cotton, and he was to have had a shilling for his trouble. An officer was immediately sent for, and the prisoner was delivered into his custody.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am confident it was the prisoner that received the cotton from the boy, for he had it in his apron when I took him.</p>

I stopped the prisoner at the bar when I was on duty, at about eleven o'clock in the morning, of the 5th of September, a the corner of Bull Head-passage, just by Wood-street, he had a bundle under his arm, and on my interrogating him, he neither knew where he got it, nor where he was going with it, nor what he was going to do with it. He appeared to be a hawker of wood. He had this bundle of pitch wood in his hand. I took him into a house. In this bundle I found twelve lace shawls. This might perhaps be four hundred yards from Mr. Jerome's house. I afterwards found they were Mr. Jerome's property.</p>

On the 5th of this month, I was in my counting-house, behind the warehouse, and at about eleven o'clock<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130012"/>in the morning, I heard the door open, and somebody asked if there was any wood wanted? (without taking my attention from my books, which I was then looking over,) I answered, no. These shawls had been on the counter, and were not missed until they were brought back by the officer. I did not see the face of the person who asked if any wood was wanted, because I did not raise my head. My counting-house looks into the warehouse. The shawls here produced by the street keeper, are my property; they have my private shop mark, masculine, on them, and they are worth from ten pounds to twelve pounds.</p>

I ran out directly, and the man was just then leaning over to get something else, but I did not mind that, and pursued the boy, whom I never lost sight of, and shortly after came up to, and then he threw the knife case down. I took him, and sent for an officer.</p>

The mistress of the house said, that she saw my watch chain hanging out when I came into the house, and the watch must be produced. I then dressed myself, and when I put my hand in my pocket, I found my pocket-book was gone. The prisoners denied knowing any thing about it. I then asked the landlady to give me a sheet of paper and pen and ink, that I might write for an officer. Elizabeth then ran away, and I after her, and secured her.

I was alarmed about five o'clock in the morning of the 9th, by hearing the prosecutor say he had been robbed of his watch, I had seen the chain hanging out of his fob the night before, and determined that he should not be robbed in my house; I told Elizabeth that the watch must be given up, but she denied all knowledge of it. The prosecutor then was writing for an officer, when she said to me, if he would remain there, she would get the watch. She took me down the Coal-yard, and called at the bottom of a pair of stairs, Sally, and then brought me the watch, which I delivered to the prosecutor. Afterwards she said, she had one pound twelve shillings, but it was her own. I went to the watchhouse, and fetched Furzeman. She delivered the one pound twelve shillings to me at the time she delivered the watch. When Furzeman came, the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130014"/>prosecutor discovered he had lost some money as well as the watch.</p>

            . I am an officer belonging to Hatton Garden office. Between four and five in the afternoon, of the 8th of September, I was standing in company with Limbrick, a brother officer, and I observed the prisoner with something apparently very heavy tied up in this piece of green baize, (produces it,) and hanging by a cord over his shoulder, which it appeared to cut; I remarked this circumstance to Limbrick, and we agreed to follow the prisoner, which we did, across Clerkenwell green, and into Red Lion-street, and there we went up to him, and stopped him; we observed him looking into a good many old iron shops on Mutton hill. I asked him what he had there, and he said, nails: he said, he had them from his brother, who was a manufacturer at Sheffield. I asked him where he was going to sell them, and he said, in Smithfield. I went with him to Mr. Wright's, the great nail warehouse, in Smithfield, and called Mr. Wright out of the counting-house. Mr. Wright asked him where he got them, and he said, from Sheffield; Mr. Wright said, that was a falsity, for they were Birmingham nails. After going to various nail warehouses, we at last, discovered them to be the property of Messrs. Williams and Blunt.</p>

He went with me to my lodgings, and I took out of my chest, a silk waistcoat, a pair of trowsers, and a jacket, and gave them to him. My landlady then came in, and told me I was giving clothes away to a common thief, and shoved him out of doors. I thought he was really in distress, and jumped over the hatch which she had shut, and followed him. He said, he would get a warrant for her for saying what she did of him, and soon after, he remarked what a pretty little watch I had, and asked me to let him look at it; I took it, and gave it into his hand, holding the chain myself, which he gently drew out of my hand; I turned, and immediately he was gone; I pursued, and lost sight of him, and so I gave information at the office. The next time I saw him was in the custody of Brown, the officer.</p>
               <p>JOHN BROWN. I am an officer. I apprehended the prisoner, and asked him what he had done with the watch, and he said, he had taken it back to Pearce. Going along, he said, Brown, it is no use telling you a lie, I have pawned the watch; he told me the pawnbroker's, and after I took him to the office, I went and got the watch; and here it is.</p>

I was drinking with the prisoners in the tap-room; I was perfectly sober, and having fallen off the Portsmouth coach coming to London, I was not able to look out for a bed for myself, so I said, I would thank any one to help me to a bed;

             told me she would help me to a bed, which she did, and not being able to strip myself, laid down with my clothes on, and soon after, the other prisoner, Maria, came up. I fell asleep, and they remained in the room. My money was safe then in a pocket-book, which was in a sort of belt round my body. I was awakened by the prisoners rummaging my clothes about, and then I perceived they had got the pocket-book. I saw Elizabeth take the notes out of it: then she threw the pocket-book at me, and then they both ran down stairs. I picked the pocket-book up, but it was empty. I then went down stairs, and to the place where I first fell in with them, but could learn no tidings of them. At last, I fell in with them at the Kettle Drum, in Ratcliffe Highway, and I immediately procured an officer, and had them taken into custody. I am sure I had four notes for the payment of five pounds each, and two for the payment of one pound each.</p>

On my return from the Continent, after the late campaign, I took up a temporary residence at the Northumberland coffee-house, and shortly afterwards took lodgings in the prisoner's mother's house, at the West end of the Town. The prisoner I believe, is a musical instrument maker. I employed him to bring several articles from the Northumberland coffee-house to his mother's, and last of all, I told him to go for the desk in question; I apprized him of its contents, which were two twenty pound notes, two ten-pound notes, and several valuable papers, which were infinitely of more of consequence than my money. He never returned at all.</p>

The season was very dry, and I could only trace which way the wheels went for a short space, and it was in a direction for the High road, in front of St. James's chapel. In consequence of information which I received, I went down to Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, and there I saw the wheels and springs, which I can swear are my property, and belonged to this chaise cart.</p>

             I knew before. Thomas told me he had a friend, pointing to Roberts, who wished to sell a chaise cart; he had sold it at Smithfield to a grocer, who resided at St. Albans, and he had taken it down to him, but found he had not the money, and so they brought it to me, thinking I was a likely person to purchase it. Roberts was standing by when this conversation took place. Roberts appeared to be the owner, and I bargained with him for it; after some chaffering, I agreed to give him four pounds ten shillings for it, it was out of repair rather, the wheels were bad, and one of the springs was bent, so I took off the springs, and put wooden ones in their places, and put on another pair of wheels. Thomas and Mr. Warden came down together in a gig in a few days afterwards, and I understood it was to shew Mr. Warden where they had sold the cart. Warden immediately claimed the wheels and springs when I shewed them to him.

             on Monday, the 11th of September, in Cold Bath-fields; he said, there were two others remained, a baker, and another named Bason, and if I would go with him, he would shew me where to find them; he said, this Bason lived over the water, and then he said, he lived some where else, and at last, from the description he gave me, and a direction to Shropshire-court, Pancras-street, Tottenham-court-road. I apprehended Roberts. Roberts told me that Thomas, and a baker, named Riddell, (who has since absconded,) told him that he was to appear to be the owner of the cart, and Thomas knew a smith down at Dunstable, who would buy it; I first saw the cart at Mr. Fox's, in Cold Bath-fields.</p>

            . I live in Baker-row, Cold Bath Fields. I know nothing of the sale of the cart. All I know is, that I went to Dunstable about the 8th of August, and Nicolls bought the gig I went down in from me, and lent me the chaise cart in question to come up to London in. That cart was afterwards seen on my premises by Marden, and claimed to be his.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was in company with Brown when he took Roberts, on the 11th of September; he said, that Thomas, and a man named Riddell, drew away the cart, and he, (Roberts) considered it as Thomas's property. It was taken from the back of the prosecutor's house, he said, but he did not know but what it was Thomas's own property, and he being poor, and having a large family starving, was induced to go down to Dunstable to sell it, and present himself as the owner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I saw his family, and they really were in a most wretched condition; no furniture in the house at all, except an old box, upon which Roberts himself was sitting, and three straw beds up stairs, upon which the children were laying.</p>

            . These are the springs of my cart, and I have seen the rest in the yard; it might be worth ten pounds; it cost me thirteen pounds three months ago.</p>
               <p>Thomas's Defence. I was in company with Roberts at a coach-maker's in the New-road, and we were asked over the way by a man named Riddell, a baker, who asked us to buy a cart; I said I did not want one, and Roberts said, he had no money, but we agreed to sell it for him.</p>
               <p>Roberts's Defence. What Thomas says is true; that we were invited by this Riddell, (who has since run away,) to buy this cart, and as I had no money, I could not, and we agreed to sell the cart for him, and accordingly that night we went into the Regent's Park, and he led us to a yard where the cart was, and he and Thomas drew it through a dust yard, and into the High-road, and I borrowed a horse of a man who is here, to take the cart down to Dunstable, which I at first understood was only fourteen miles from Town. We saw Riddle the Friday following in Smithfield, and gave him the money.</p>

I had just got to the front of the watch-house, without knowing it, when I asked the prisoner the way to it; she said she was also going to the watchhouse, and if I would go with her, she would conduct me thither. She walked down the lane with me, and contrived to get behind me; in a moment I missed my watch, but did not feel it go from me; I suppose she took it, when I stopped to ask her my way. I called the watchman, and saw her trying to shove the watch into his pocket.</p>

I returned on Monday morning, at about half past ten; there are three locks to the outer door of my premises, a top one, a bottom one, and one in the middle. I usually unlocked the middle lock, but when I put in the key, I found it was not locked; I had locked it I am certain on the Saturday night. I could neither unlock the top nor the bottom locks, they were both spoiled. I suspected all was not right. I accordingly went to the back part of the premises, and perceived the doors which I had locked on the Saturday evening, were broken open. I got in, and on examining the goods, found twenty seven dozen pounds weight of thread, and one hundred and seventeen yards of linen gone. The whole of what was taken away was worth forty pounds, and what I got back, might be worth eighteen pounds.</p>

            . I am a City constable. On the 30th of July, at about a quarter before seven o'clock in the morning, I saw a chaise cart standing at the door of the Punch-bowl, just opposite Little Queen-street in Holborn. There was a man in it, and presently I saw

On the Tuesday morning following, I accompained Salmon and Wilson, two other officers, with a search warrant at about six in the morning, to search the Punch-bowl, Old Scarr's house. Salmon told him, we came to search his house, and he said very well, and he would accompany us, and he would just go and call his wife, to mind the business. He went up stairs, we followed him close and met him just coming out of the room where his wife was in bed, with the same dark canvas bag in his arms which I had seen his son carry in on the Sunday morning. Salmon told him to put it down, which he did, and I was sent to call Davis, the clerk to the prosecutor, who was waiting outside; he came in immediately, and said the contents was his master's property. I searched the bedroom, and in a box, I found a quantity of linen,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130021"/>which Davis also said was his master's property. The father told me that a man named

The bed was not made, and only appeared to have been slept in by one person. In his box, I found this bunch of skeleton keys, and these bottles of phosphorus; I knew it was his box, for his shirts were in it, and when we were taking him away, he wanted a clean shirt out of that very box. We told him not to mind it then, as he could have it another time. He then went with us.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with the two last witnesses at Old Scarr's house, and afterwards in Angel alley, to get young Scarr. I searched a cupboard in the back room on the ground floor; Old Scarr was with me; before I opened it, he said there was nothing there belonging to this business, but said he would go and fetch the key to unlock it; I told him there was no necessity for that, and would not let him go; I took out a knife to open it, but found that it was not locked. In this cupboard, there was a piece of green baize, under which I found these three separate parcels of linen, each of them wrapped up in a silk handkerchief. I said to him, that this is what we were in search of. I next searched the bar, and there I found a pound of whitey-brown thread, and a remnant of linen. I then searched the cellar, but found nothing there. Here are all the things we found.</p>

            . On the 24th of August, I dined with Sir Lumley Skeffington, in Charles-street, Grosvenor-square. I quitted his house at about nine o'clock in the evening, for the purpose of going to the Haymarket Theatre; Sir Lumley accompanied me part of the way; I went through the Green Park, down Constitution Hill, where Sir Lumley quitted me.

He said, my name is Manners, and I wish to speak to you. I told him, he must be mistaken, and desired him to leave me immediately. He then said, he was in great distress, and he wanted some money, which I refused to give him, having never seen him in my life before. He then seized me by the collar of the coat, and said, unless you give me some, I will accuse you with having attempted to commit an unnatural crime upon me, and will follow you to your own house. I was not at all alarmed; but told him to follow me quietly into Pall Mall, and I would borrow some money of a friend, as I had none about me. I had money about me, he said so, and the first watchman I met was just at Hammersley's the banker's, to whom I gave him in charge. He then begged pardon, and begged to be let go. I went with him to the watchhouse, and there when I had given in my charge, the prisoner dropped upon his knees, and entreated me over and over again to let him go. I was determined however not to let him go.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was one night, about this time twelvemonth, sitting in the stage box at Covent Garden Theatre, when Captain Parker came in, and fell into conversation with me; after the play was over, he went and spent the evening with me, at the King's Head coffee-house, just by Furnival's-inn, in Holborn, and I paid five and thirty shillings for him, as his share of the reckoning, and this evening, I was in the Green Park, he met me as he was walking with Sir Lumley, and said, how do you do, Manners, where have you been all this time; I told him, I was in very great distress, and would thank him to let me have the money that he owed me, but he said, he could not speak to me then, as I was dressed so shabbily, and Sir Lumley Skeffington was with him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Since the prisoner has dared to set up a defence of this kind, I must go farther in proof.</p>

I laid down on the bed, and fell asleep, and on my awaking in the morning, I found myself alone. I went down to the mistress of the house, who told me she knew nothing of the prisoner. I have never seen neither watch or notes since. On Thursday, the 3rd of August, the prisoner was in custody at Bow-street; when I saw her, I knew her immediately; she acknowledged at the bar there that she was the person who robbed me.</p>

We went to the Two Brewers public house, at Ponders End; we there had a pot of beer outside of the door. After that we went to Mr. Mellish's field above the brick ground, and drove the sheep up against the hedge and the gate, and there

We took it down to Corby's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130025"/>house, Streamer carried it part of the way, and we all assisted for that purpose. When we had got to Corbey's house, Streamer stuck it. We then went into the brick ground for some wood; we then went back to Corbey's, and Corbey skinned it, and I purchased it. We took the skin into a bean field, and we buried it in the field. I afterwards told Mr. Reynard, the patrole, where it was buried, and it was dug up there. The carcase was cut up into quarters, and put into a box, and the box was taken into a field of Mr. Allen's, two fields off of Corbey's house. I was afterwards taken up for an assault, and confessed to the patrole.</p>

            . I am porter at the Saracen's Head, Snow-hill. On the 22nd of June, the prisoner arrived at our inn, by the Portsmouth coach, slept there that night and the next day went away. The next day, I went to the York Hotel, and there heard that the prisoner, or a foreigner answering his description, had taken up his abode there. I asked the waiter to let me look at his trunk; which I did, and then was convinced it was him. The next day the waiter's clothes were stolen, and I went to Bow-street to get an officer, and on our enquiring at the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, we found that the prisoner had sent his trunks there, and was to sleep there that night, in order to go off by some one of the coaches in the morning. We examined his room, and there we found the waiter's clothes laying open and exposed in the room, but his trunks fast. Beresford knew them to be his property. We gave information at the bar, and requested to be informed when the prisoner came in, which was at eleven o'clock that night, and then he was taken into custody; he was taken to the watchhouse, and on Monday morning to Queen-square office.</p>

On my arriving at the Golden Cross, I went up stairs to the prisoner's room, No. 34, and unlocked it, and in it, we found two tranks, a leather one, and a pasteboard one, and loose on a chair were laying all the prosecutor's clothes, which he missed, except the silk stockings, which were afterwards found in one of the trunks. By the direction of Mr. Fielding, I brought every thing of the prisoner's to the office. Here are the clothes.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Being deprived of my papers and money by the Police, I have been unable to procure an advocate: I have therefore committed my defence to paper in my own language, and will take the liberty of reading it to the court. I am an <rs id="t18150913-81-deflabel460" type="occupation">officer in French Army</rs>

On the return of the Bourbon family to the French Throne, I was honoured by having a commission in the Garde De Corps. But soon after Napoleon returning from Elba, and I wishing not to draw my sword against my lawful Savereign, I returned, by the advice of my friends, to this Country, where I remained at bath for a considerable time. In June last, I came to this City to meet some of my brother officers; I took up my lodging at the York Hotel,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130028"/>at which place the innocent cause of my present misfortunes arose. I have been reared in the paths of rectitude and truth by my excellent parents, and am confident that justice for which a British Jury is celebrated throughout Europe, will this day be shewn towards me. I am most innocent of the charge which is imputed to me, and I will in a moment account for this unhappy mistake. The morning after I arrived in London, I received orders with some of my brother officers, to join my regiment; the next morning, I packed up all my clothes, and went to the Golden Cross, Charing Cross, but then found the coach had gone off. I returned to the York Hotel to change my trowsers, and without going up into my own room, went into an empty room, which I saw open, and there unpacked the whole of my things in one trunk, as my trowsers were at the bottom; in re-packing them, I suppose it was, that I put up the clothes of the prosecutor's; for as I said before, I am so blind that I never perceived them; I then went to the Golden Cross, determined to sleep there that night, in order to be in time for the coach the next morning. When I went into my room, I put my spectacles on, and on examining my clothes, was greatly surprized to find a coat, waistcoat, shirt, and stockings, which did not belong to me; I could not conceive how they came there, and it was not until I was in prison, that I supposed they came there, by the means I have suggested. I did not conceal them as if stolen, but put them openly out, and locked my trunks. Unfortunately all my papers and trunks have been kept from me, together with a pocket-book, which if I had, I might be able to convince the Court and Jury of the rank I held in the French Army, and of my belonging to the Legion of Honor. I have not a friend in this Country, as all my brother officers are gone. I have only again to repeat my innocence, and place myself in the hands of a British Jury, from whom I am sure I shall receive justice.</p>

            . I am a marshalman of the City of London. Having a warrant to apprehend the prisoner, I went and found him at Arundel; I called him down stairs, and told him I had a warrant against him for forgery; we went to a tavern, where Romanis was; the prisoner requested to speak to Mr. Ridge, one of the partners of the Bank. Nothing was said to him to induce him to confess. He said, I am guilty, and claim your mercy.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he seen the note when he said this - A. He had not. I told him not to say any thing, but he said he had made them with a camel hair brush. He said he had made more than this one. We then went into a carriage, and went to Chichester, and there he took us up stairs, and shewed us some coulouring, and some brushes, with which he had done them. His companion is a man, whom we have not in custody. He did not at that time tell me any thing more; all that he has told me since is much to the same effect.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. I found no other notes. I did not find Jordane. He said, he had been in company with Jordane.</p>

            . I recollect taking a letter to Mr. Munton, but I don't know when; I got that letter from that man, (pointing to the prisoner,) he is a stranger to me; he said, will you go on an errand for me? I said, yes. He then gave me the letter, and shewed me the place where I was to deliver it; it was at an office in Downing-street. He told me to ask for Mr. Munton, and if I did not see him, I was to enquire after him. He said I was to bring the answer to him opposite Downing-street, where he would wait. I carried the letter, and saw Mr. Munton, who came back with me to the place where the prisoner said he would wait; but he was not there. I never saw him before I saw him in the Westminster-road, but I am quite sure it is him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Now, you know this man is trying for his life. This which you state was what happened three months ago. Can you say on what day it was - A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never say it was on the 10th of June - A. I don't recollect that I did. I talked to some one here in the yard; and I believe it was on a Friday in May. I think I said so to the justice at Bow-street; I think it was about Friday, the 14th of May.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know when it was - A. It was on a Friday. I gave it to Mr. Munton on the same day, and I believe I told the justice at Bow-street that it was on a Friday in May. I am quite sure the prisoner at the bar is the man who sent me with it. I saw him in Prison.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. Now when you saw him in Prison, are you sure you were not told that the man you would see, was the man who gave the letter to you, and therefore you believed so when you saw him - A. No; nobody told me so. The prisoner walked over Westminster-bridge with me, and pointed out the place in Downing-street where I was to deliver the letter.</p>

That letter enclosed a draft to me upon Hammersley and Co. for ten pounds, which draft was signed Williams. I went with the boy to where he said the the prisoner was to wait, but he was not there; it was just by Whitehall, opposite to the Treasury; nobody was there. The note enclosing this draft was signed Allen. I know a person of that name who belongs to the Excise office. The prisoner knew Mr. Allen. When I first saw the note I really thought it was Allen's hand-writing, but afterwards I was confident it was not, when I compared it to Allen's hand-writing. That draft appears to have been drawn by a Mr. Williams in favour of one Thomson, neither of whom I know.</p>

            . I had made no appointment with Mr. Munton whatever to meet him in the evening of the 27th of June. I had received two notes previous to this, purporting to be from Mr. Allen, but which were not, and by them three pounds had been obtained from me. So close was the imitation of the hand-writing of Allen on each of those, that I could have sworn to it; one of them was dated from Westminster Hall, requesting one pound, which was sent. On the morning I appointed to meet him, and in answer to the letter I had sent, this letter enclosing the draft was returned to me, by the boy I had sent three pounds to him in similar requests in writing, by two different persons.</p>

I had occasion to go back again at ten o'clock, and the padlock was off the door, and I could not get in. I pushed, and the person who was inside was pushing also; in an instant he rushed out upon me, and I saw it was the prisoner; I laid hold of him, and said, murder, and thieves; he ran down stairs, and I after him, and I cried stop that thief, and he was taken. I found nothing was removed out of the room; but a bonnet-box, which had been on the top of another box, by the side of the bed, was removed, that contained a black silk bonnet, and a straw bonnet, for one of which I gave fourteen shillings, two years ago; and the straw one twelve shillings. I don't think together that they are worth more than five shillings.</p>

I was first acquainted with the prisoner in 1809, he was in the habit of constantly coming for small parcels of goods to the amount of twelve or fourteen shillings for which he always paid ready money. From being a man of gentlemanly appearance and address, he gave me an order to send some goods to his house in Queen square, Aldersgate-street. The money was not brought back, but the receipt I sent was, and the goods left. I did not see the prisoner for a long time, and when I did, it was in a quarrel in our street, which he had with a woman, who exclaimed, Mr. Bowyer, here is

The next time I saw him, was on the 16th of April, 1813. he came into my shop on that day, in company with a gentleman, and said I suppose you don't know me? I said I did; Ah, said he, I have suffered a great deal since I saw you, I have been in a French prison, but being released, I have just landed at Plymouth, and I determined the first step I would take in town, would be to discharge your debt; but how you have altered and improved your shop! Whilst he was making this last observation, he presented me with the bill in question.</p>

            . This is the note, I know it by the prisoner's name being written upon it. I wrote it myself, in his presence, before I gave him the change. It was for ten pounds, and I gave him a check upon my bankers Down Thornton, and Tree for the difference. After the prisoner went out, I began to suspect, and went immediately to stop payment of the check, but the prisoner had just got it cashed, and gone out of the house. I sent the bill to my banker, and did not do any thing, until it became due which was on the 23rd of April. On that day I went to No. 4, Mark-lane, I found there a counting house, but shut up, and nobody there. I did not see the prisoner again until the 27th of July last. I never found the person to whom this bill was directed.</p>

I still followed on, and observed him very busy, and in about twenty minutes I got up into the waggon, and observed him sewing up the seam of bag 16, Seeing me get up into the waggon, he swore at me, and demanded, did I come to plunder it? I told him no; but I was a police officer, and I should apprehend him for doing so; and I told him, I had been observing him all the time. He besought me to desist, saying, he had a large family, and it would be the ruin of him. I then examined the bag when we came to the London Dock, and found that a hole had been cut in it, large enough to admit this tin tube; that would be a very convenient tube for conveying the pepper out of bag 16 into his own bag, and it is the same size as the hole.</p>

On the night of the 17th of August, between the hours of twelve and one, I was standing at my own door, I saw two coloured men, the prisoner, and the prosecutor, coming along the street; I saw the prisoner knock the prosecutor down; I did not see him do anything else, as I went and called the watch. I took them both to the watchhouse, where they could not make out who was the person charged; for the prosecutor said he had been robbed, and the prisoner said he had drawn a knife upon him. The prisoner was searched, and in his breast jacket pocket, the notes were wrapt up in a Jark handkerchief. The prisoner claimed it as his; the prosecutor as his. The prisoner was told if it was his, to tell what was in it? this was said before the handkerchief was examined. The prisoner said there were nine one pound notes in it, the prosecutor said there were one, two, three twenty pound notes in it, and upon opening the handkerchief, it was exactly so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Walford. At first I took no notice of them in the street; but the prisoner charged the prosecutor with drawing a knife against him; and for that they were both taken to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>"So help me God, he had no money but a few halfpence, which he produced." I then searched him, and found and old handkerchief in a breast pocket, which ran down on the inside of his jacket; here it is. Before I opened it, I asked whose it was, and what was in it, the prisoner said it was his, and contained nine one pound notes. I asked the prosecutor if it was his? he said it was, and contained three twenty pound notes, and a smart ticket. I opened it and found three twenty pound notes, a smart ticket, and a piece of leather wrapt round them. That smart ticket has the name of

I was at Woolwich on the 17th of August, and paid the prosecutor the sum of eighty four-pounds nineteen shillings and six pence, as his share of prize money and pay, without any deduction whatever.

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. By the good God I am innocent of robbing this man, I had the note to take care of for him as a friend. I went down to Woolwich and went on board his ship, knowing some of the crew; and he being a stranger, and a man of my own colour, I asked him to lodge with me when he came to London, which he agreed to. He told me I had better stay on board, for there would be blankets and things which would be throwed away, and as I might as well have them as any one else. When the crew was paid off, he sent one here for half a gallon of rum, and we got all quite comfortable; and when we were coming off, they all made me commodore, and this here Jack, (pointing to the prosecutor) was drunk, and very riotous, and disobeyed my orders; when we came on shore, he would have more rum; I told him I was commodore; I was superior officer, and would not let him, but he would have some, and went and got some. We hired a cart to bring up the chests, and my blankets and things, and we all got on board, and was very merry; but this Jack was drunk and quarrelsome, and would have something to drink, at every public house he came to. After we came up, he changed one note, and gave me the rest to take care of; and went to a cook's shop, and got something for supper; we went into him at the cook's shop, and he wanted to go with girls; we went to a house where there were<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130034"/>some, one got one, and another got one, and this Jack made a bargain with a lady, but something was the matter and she went away. I fancy they did not agree. Jack made a row, because she would not stay, and blamed me for it, saying I took her away. At last we agreed to go home to our lodgings; he was very quarrelsome; and in the way pulled out his knife, and swore he would kill me Portugue. I was obliged to knock him down to try to take away the knife, and when the watchman came up, he swore I had robbed him, and I was taken to the watchhouse. He came here to swear away my life to day (addressing himself to the prosecutor.) You Jack, you know it was all a drunken frolick; so help me God Almighty I am as innocent as the child unborn.</p>

            . I am an unfortunate girl, and live at No. 5, Williams court, Cable-street. In August last, I remember being in company with the prisoner and the prosecutor; it was on a Thursday, I heard a noise at No, 7, of some people merry making, and being in an importunate situation, I went and opened the door, and saw a number of sailors and women drinking and making merry. I said I suppose I am not wanted here; Mr.

             a dark blue handkerchief, saying Morris, take care of that until to-morrow morning. I don't know what were the contents; I did not like the prosecutor's company, he was very quarrelsome, and I got up and went to my own lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Gurney. I have been in this unfortunate situation between nine and ten years. I have known the prisoner at the bar about nine months, by his coming to see a girl that is in the same situation as I am in, and who live up my court; I have known the woman with whom he cohabits, nine years. I was informed that this prosecution was made against him, and that was the reason I came here to day; he did not send for me.</p>

            . I am the son of the last witness. On the 30th of July, I staid at home after my father and mother were gone out, until eight o'clock; I then went out with a young man named Burgoyne, who called for me. We locked the door, and put the key under the mat. We met the prisoner Townsend, and a young man named Marrian, together. Townsend asked me if my father was out? I told him, he was. They asked me where I was going, and I said to the Wheatsheaf, in Drury-lane. They asked me how my father would get in when he came home? I told them, he would find the key under the mat. They said, they would come down to me at the Wheatsheaf. That was all that passed. Marrian had been a school-fellow of mine; I did not know where Townsend lived at that time. I heard that my father was robbed, for the first time, at about eleven o'clock, the same night when I went home. Neither Townsend nor Marrian came to us at the Wheatsheaf. The next morning, I told Townsend, that I had a suspicion it was him that did the robbery; he denied it. At eleven o'clock, I got a search warrant, and searched his place, but found nothing.</p>

When he was gone, I put my hand into one which appeared the most heavy, and drew out some coffee; on further examination, I found there were seven pounds six ounces; it was tied up in a handkerchief, and in the nose bag. I took it up into my own room, and then went to enquire if he had delivered the coffee safe.

I went into the room soon after they were gone, and saw a watch laying on the floor. It was my girl first told me to send the prosecutor away, for she said, he had a watch, and being with bad women, would lose it.</p>

The prisoner was with me at that search, and opened a box by my desire, in which I found six bottles of wine, and various parcels of seed; there was more than twelve pounds altogether; there were some few pound of turnip seed; the cabbage seed cost me four shillings and sixpence a pound; the turnip seed might be worth one shilling; fifteen yards of Osnaburg linen, value fifteen shillings. The prisoner had access to all these things while in my employ. I asked him where he got all these things, and he confessed they were mine, and that he took the wine when Mr. Lucas gave him the cellar key.</p>

               <p>Mr. Wrench. All I know about the wine is, that it was very learious and remarkable good wine, and I had it from a wine merchant named Power, whose name was sealed on the cork of each bottle.</p>

The prisoner Paxton asked me, if I had a single room to be let; I told him I had one with two bedsin it, in one which two young men slept. He agreed to take this, and brought several little bundles there that night; the other prisoner came in on Friday following and asked for these bundles; he came and said, has not Harry something here? I said he has; he said I am come for his things, has he not a packing case here; I told him he had, but refused to let him have his things at first, but afterwards permitted him to take them. I can't say what were taken away. My servants brought the things down, and Pope packed them in the packing case. He said Harry, meaning Paxton had got a place as coachman in the country, and he, Pope, was to send his things down to him. Pope was dressed like a coachman, and I said where do you live coachman? he told me at the other side of Russel square; but it afterwards appeared he did not. I said if Paxton went to him to tell him to send his clothes into the country, he might have called upon me in his way; but Pope said it was he that went to Paxton.</p>

            . I am an officer of the public office, Marlborough street. On Friday the 30th of June. I took Paxton into custody on suspicion of having stolen the articles mentioned in the indictment. I told him what he was taken for, and that it was very material to inform me where he spent the evening and night of the 28th of June; he said he slept at No. 20, Gower Mews; I went with him there and saw the coachman who lived there; I asked him if Paxton slept there, on Wednesday night? before the coachman had time to answer, Paxton said, you know I slept there; the coachman then said yes. I told him that Paxton was charged with having committed a my on that night. Then said the coachman if that is the case, I won't tell a lie for any body; he never did sleep here. Paxton then acknowledged that he did not; but he really slept in the stables belonging to

            , at Cheney's Mews; and he said the reason he did not tell me the truth at first, was for fear he should get the coachman anger. I then went to 25, Cheney's Mews, with Paxton; but Pope was not there. We then went to his lodgings, which Paxton knew, and which were in Mortimer Market. I found Pope there. I put some questions to him whether Paxton had slept at his stables on the Wednesday night; he said he had; he had lent him a horse cloth, in which he slept in the hay loft. I said if you can prove that, this man must be innocent; you had better come with me down to the magistrates; he said I can't do that, for I must drive my master out in about three quarters of an hour. I told him that Paxton should not be examined until he came; and the magistrates waited until five o'clock in the evening in order that he might come down, but he never came at all. In consequence of some information which I received, I went to Pope the next morning, and said, you did not come according to your promise yesterday; he told me it was not in his power, for he could not get time. I then asked him whether he had fetched anything from Mr. Hough's and said if you could not find time to come to the office, you could find time to go to Hough's to fetch the things away in the packing case; he denied that he went to Hough's immediately. I told him he had brought Paxton's things away, and the landlord knew him. I then searched the stables, but found nothing relating to this charge. I then went to his lodgings with him but found nothing there; I told him he had fetched something from Mr. Hough's; and he certainly must know what it was, for he packed it up himself. He then said, well I will tell the truth, and pointing to a box, that is the box I fetched away; I looked into it, it was empty. I said that can't be the box, it was a large packing case, and so full, that you could not put a hat in it, and you were obliged to carry it in your hand. He then began crying and his wife fainted away, and there was a great deal of distress; and he said he had fetched them away for Paxton, and when I and Paxton went together to his stables, Paxton made a signal to him to say he slept there. I asked him what he had done with the things, he said he brought them away from Hough's to save Paxton if he could, as he had a friendship for him, and had sent them to Camberwell by the Peckham stage directed to

            . I am a printer to Mr. Bell, and locked up the house on the night of the 19th of June, and had the keys in my possession all that night; I was the first who entered it the next morning, at about twenty minutes after seven o'clock, and in going to my breakfast, I perceived the window of the counting house door was broken; I should rather say the glass was not broken, but taken quite out; I knew it was not broken the night before; I observed Mr. Holland's desk was not shut down. I went for the key, and on opening the door, perceived that the desk had been wrenched off; and perceived some indentions or marks of the instrument, with which it had been forced open. My suspicions immediately alighted, on Sweeting. In consequence of that suspicion I went with Clarke, the constable to the Cornish Arms, on Wednesday evening, about nine o'clock; and on finding him there, apprehended him. He was taken to the watchhouse, and the next morning he sent an officer to me, saying he wanted to speak to me; on my arrival he told me he knew some of the parties who had committed the robbery; and said he had received a one pound note, and some silver, for information which he had given to the parties who had committed the robbery. He said that bad company had been the ruin of him. He said one Hill, and a Charles, but he mentioned no surname, had led him to it; he said if I could make an intercession he would be glad; and I said, I would make any intercession that laid in my power. He said he was not present at the robbery himself, but was at the Adam and Eve all the evening. I saw a hammer tried to marks on the desk, which hammer exactly fitted the indentions.</p>
               <p>JOHN BEAN I am a patrole of the parish of St. Clements Danes; and saw the three prisoners at the bar at a quarter before two, in the middle of the Saturday night, between the 19th and 20th of June; they were with two others, and two girls; I did not know Hill before; but I knew Sweeting, I followed them up Catherinestreet, from the Strand, up Brydges street, into Russel street, and so on, until I lost sight of them in Drury lane; I had my reason for looking after them. The next time I saw them was at about ten minutes before three; they were all the same persons again; I was standing at the end of Fountain court, which may be about twenty yards from them. I saw Taylor take something like notes out of his pocket, together with some silver, and I saw him sharing it; I saw him give a three shilling piece to one, and a three shilling piece to another. I then heard a boy, named

I then told one of the watchman, to go round Founting court, as they immediately separated when they discovered I was there; I had no chance of catching any of them then. I apprehended Taylor, on the first night of the illumination for the battle of Waterloo. I did not take Hill into custody until afterwards. I searched Hill's lodgings, on the same morning that he and Sweeting had an examination at Bow street, I found at his lodgings this slater's hammer; I don't know that Hill is a slater. I have seen that hammer tried to the marks in the desk, and from its fitting the marks in every part, even the teeth and all, I am enabled to say, that I believe it is the instrument made use of to break open the desk.</p>

            . I am constable of St. Clements. In consequence of a description which we received from the last witness he was found in his lodgings, and there also the dress he was described to have worn, was found. We did not bring the hammer away at first; but afterwards we fitted it to the marks on the counting house door, and found it fitted the holes which were made in it. We afterwards tried it to the desk, and there it fitted in a similar manner. Here are some pieces of wood which were broken off the door, they have similar indentations, and the hammer also fits them. I don't know what business Hill is; he said, he was a coppersmith. At Bow-street, I was present when Sweeting told Delancy that he introduced the other two prisoners how to commit the robbery; but was not present with them when it was committed; he told Delancy after he had been crying.</p>

I missed the things on the Saturday morning, and I cast my eye upon them as I went to bed on the Friday night. I took the prisoner home, as she said she was distressed for a night's lodging; I gave her part of my supper, and permission to sleep in the room with me. She went away about half past two, or three, in the morning; I did not hear her go out, but was awakened by the watchman at half past two, who told me that the stable door was open. In the morning, I found the watch and shawl missing. The prisoner was afterwards taken into custody, and I saw my shawl at the pawnbroker.</p>

            . I am the wife of Mr. Cooke. I missed some tablecloths some time after the prisoner had left our lodgings; he said he was going to lodge at Mrs. Wilson's in Nottingham-place. On my missing the tablecloths, I went to Mrs. Wilson, having heard he had offered some to her for sale. I told him I had missed them: but he said, those which he had offered to Mrs. Wilson, he had brought from America with him, and that they were his property. I begged to see them; but he said, he could not produce them, as he had given them to a brother officer, of the name of Dodd, who was then at Portsmouth. The next morning, the tablecloths were found at Mr. Teasdale's, the publican's; I knew them to be my tablecloths, and the C was picked out. I went to the prisoner's lodgings again, but found he was gone to others, a Mrs. Burton.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. I believe the defendant has been serving in the British Army in America. I had a reference for his character to Mr. Glover, Secretary at the Admiralty. I believe it was four or five weeks before the prisoner was examined before the magistrate.</p>
               <p>ANN WILSON. On the 21st of June, the prisoner came to lodge at my house; it was the same day that he left Mrs. Cooke's; he offered me four tablecloths to sell; I observed, I should like to know where he got them? he said, he had bought them of a brother officer, at Bermuda, who told him that he had given ten dollars for the largest of them, for a mess-cloth. I did not purchase them of him. I afterwards saw the same tablecloths at Teasdale's, the publican's, and those which he has now produced are the same.</p>

            . I happened to be passing by, at the time of the robbery. I observed the two prisoners coming along the street together. The smaller one took the gingham, while the other prisoner waited for him, three or four yards off; and when they had got it, they both ran together. Baldwin must have seen Wilkins do it; they ran full drive by me, and I went into the shop to tell the linen draper.</p>

I followed him, and he perceived I was following him, and he went up a court which leads to Mr. Smith's the attorney's office; I went into Mr. Sewell's shop, a seedsman opposite of Mr. Smith's, and presently I saw the prisoner come down the court and look about him; I pointed him out to Mr. Sewell and requested him to watch if he carried the portmanteau away, whilst I ran home to enquire whether it had been bought; I found it had not been bought, but was just missed.

            . I am a beadle of St. George's, Hanover square, and saw the prisoners in Oxford street with this muslin. I stopped her, and asked her what she had under her cloak, and she said nothing; I told her I should search her; and she then gave me the muslin, which she said she found. I took her to Marylebone watchhouse; and afterwards went to Mr. Brooks's. where the muslin was claimed. Here is the muslin.</p>

The first time I saw the prisoner was at seven o'clock in the morning of the 5th of March, when he had three quarterns of gin and milk, for which he paid, and ordered me to get a coach for him, saying, he was going to get some money of a gentleman in the Strand, who owed him for a horse; he ordered me to have a rump steak ready at half past twelve, and I had it ready against he came back. He came to my bar, and asked for change of a ten-pound note; I told him I had only two pounds in notes and twenty shillings in silver; he said three pounds would be enough for him, and he would leave the ten-pound note until he returned. I put the money down; he had some sort of a piece of paper in his hand, but I don't know that it was a ten-pound note. He snatched up my money and ran away. I expected him to have given me the ten-pound note. I did not see him again until he was taken into custody, and I believe that was in June.</p>

The prisoner had apartments in my master's house, and left on the 25th of June; she had five children, two nursery maids, and herself. A man of the name of Carter used to come every day. She usually dined between four and five. She dined on Saturday, the 25th, at about half past one; after dinner was over, the spoons were brought into the kitchen. The servants and four of the children left the house at half past two; Lady Price and her eldest daughter remained behind; she rang the bell, and I answered her; I was called up stairs, and she said, bring up the spoons; I took up one, and put it on the sideboard; Lady Price was in the room then, and nobody else; her daughter was in the yard at the time. They afterwards left the house; the key was not left in the door; I don't know who took it out. Lady Price did not return that night, nor any of her family. The next day a letter came, with something like a key in it; my master opened it, and the key of the dining-room door was in it. We made search, to see that all was right; and the table-spoon was missing, and a pair of sheets. We found no spoon in the lodging. These things were let with the lodging.</p>

I let the prisoner have the goods; they might be worth four pounds; he went away, and came a second time, but I was not at home then. I am sure the prisoner is the person; he did not say where he lived, nor mention any thing about White's-row, Shitalfields. I asked him was Mr. Evans busy? and he said, yes, since the last order came in. While he was there, one of the Mr. Morgans came in, and told me to give him the beat paper; nobody was present when he gave me the order.</p>

I told him when my husband had done with the sea, he would be glad of some employment. He said, it was in his power to do some thing for him. He then said he belonged to the Custom House himself, and then pulled out some warrant, or something to shew me that he did: and he could get my husband a situation, and it would only be two or three pounds expence to him; he said he did not want any thing for his own trouble, unless he was asked to drink a glass of any thing with the parties. When my husband came home, I told him what he had said. I told him when my husband would be at home, and he accordingly came; he said to my husband, your wife has been saying that you would wish to get some employ in your leisure time. He told him that it was in his power to obtain him some employ, and a place in the Custom House, and that it would only cost him two or three pounds expence for fees of the office. I was obliged to go away, and did not hear him say any more then.</p>

            . After the night of the 29th of June, my wife informed me what the prisoner had said to her. The next evening he came to sop at our house, seemed very friendly, and asked us how we did; he told me my wife had been telling him that I should wish some employ in my leasure hours; that he could get me a situation as weigher in the Custom House, that would not require above three or four hours daily attendance, and that it would bring me in three or four shillings a-day, and it would not cost more than two or three pounds for office fees to get that situation. I told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130050"/>him, I was very much obliged to him. He said he did not want any thing for himself, unless it was to take a glass of any thing with the parties; he appointed the Monday following to go to the Custom House, and said it would want twelve shillings for fees of the office, and ten shillings to pay for the printed warrant. I went with him to the Custom House, and he went into an office, having got this money from me, and told me to wait outside; he returned, but without the warrant; and put me off by telling me it was not ready; he got other sums from me at different times, and always put me off with different excuses.</p>

            . I am an ivory-turner, and live in Houndsditch. On Saturday, the 18th of March, the prisoner came to my house, and asked me if I wanted to buy some ivory. I asked him what sort of stuff it was? he said, there were nine teeth, weighing four hundred weight. At this time I knew of the robbery having taken place. I asked him where I could see it, as I did not like to buy it by samples, without seeing the whole. He said, it had been smuggled, and therefore cut into pieces to be brought on shore. The real reason I said I wished to see the whole was because it was exactly the same number of teeth, and nearly the same as had been stolen. He said he would endeavour to get the person who owned it, to let me see the whole; he said they were down at Blackwall. When he was gone, I communicated the substance of what he had said to Messrs. Sinclair. He came again in the morning, and came after that again at three o'clock in the afternoon. He came again on the Monday, and said he had four teeth weighing two hundred and six or two hundred and eight pounds. I understood them to be of the same parcel that he had first mentioned. He said, he would bring a piece to shew me, and in the afternoon, about three o'clock, he brought this piece; he brought it strangely wrapt up in a sack, so that it did not look like what it was. I told him I should like to have seen the whole. He said, if I would buy this piece, he would bring another, and so on, until he had brought the whole. I told him, I thought it was stolen, and as I had a suspicion of two persons, I should like to know the name of the person from whom he got it? he said, he could not help it. I said, I must detain the piece. He said, you have brought me into a strange dilemma, and then he went away. I gave information to Sinclair. I had known the prisoner fifteen or sixteen years. I had heard of the robbery on the Wednesday morning before.</p>

               <p>"Shepherd and Hine, to be left until called for." We send up a number of trusses at a time. We sent up four on the 17th of December, 1814, directed as I have stated. On the 4th of January, 1815, we sent up three; on the 7th, we sent up one, and afterwards I came up myself, to dispose of them; when I went to the inn, I only found seven there, and those were all I could get; I could tell that the one lost, was one of the three trusses sent up on the 4th of January, or the 12th of January following, I will not be sure. I went in company with Mr. Mills and Mr. Hutchinson, two officers, to the Cock and Horn, the house of the prisoner, in Duke's-place, at the bottom of Creechurch-lane; when I went in, Mr. Mills and Mr. Hutchinson had four bundles of parchment produced, which I knew to be my manufacture; they had passed through my hands so many times, that I could identify them. I never sold any to the defendant; each roll contained sixty skins. The<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130051"/>officers went in before me, and afterwards made a signal to me to come in; and I went in; after the skins had been produced, the defendant was asked where he got these skins? he said he could immediately tell, he said he had them in the house six months, and afterwards he said he took them for a bad debt, from a person of Liverpool.</p>

               <p>ALEXANDER WILLIAM MILLS. I am a law stationer in Great Shire lane. On the 12th of January, the prisoner called at my house in company with another man; I am quite sure of the prisoner's person; the man who was with him said he had a friend; who had an article which might suit me; and then he pointed to the prisoner, as the person of whom he was speaking. The prisoner then produced a roll of skins, containing sixty, wrapt up in brown holland cloth. I asked him what the price of them was; he told me four and sixpence a skin. I told him he was very young in the business because it was far above the price. I had a quantity of skins by me, each considerably larger in size, than these; for which I only gave one and sixpence per skin. I asked him where he got them from, he said he obtained them in payment of a bad debt. At that time he did not say where the persons lived whom he had got them. I told him what he asked, was above the value. He then asked me, were they worth a shilling a skin; I told him they might be, but not to me, and suspecting something, I told him I did not chuse to buy them; the person's name who came with him was Phillips from whom I had some times purchased pens, and stationary. In about half an hour afterwards Mr. Shepherd came in, to whom I communicated the circumstance. It was afterwards agreed that I should call at the prisoner's house; I never went alone; it was on Friday the 30th of January, I asked him had he disposed of the parchment, he said no, and he produced four rolls. I told him I wished to see it all, and I would call the next morning, with Hutchinsoe and Shepherd, who remained outside; he said he had two or three rolls. I asked him, had he not sold one to a Mr. Waterhouse, he said he had, to a person in Carey street, who in being described, was Mr. Waterhouse. The next morning, there were only two rolls produced to me and Shepherd; which was claimed by Shepherd, as his property. The officers went up stairs with the defendant, and brought down two more; I asked him where he got them, and he said he could not recollect. He then said, he had them in the way of his business, and had had them in the house six months; he then said he took them for a bad debt, of a man at Liverpool, but named nobody, nor the amount of the debt.</p>

In the early part of the year 1813, we were possessed of a good many houses, which we built ourselves; I believe we had about eighty cottages of different sizes; some in Summerford field, Mile end; Others in Globe fields. They were of considerable value; I had no dealings with Birch before the year 1813.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Q. Were you in that year, at all embarrassed for money, and if so, at what time - A. About April I was a little pushed for money, but it did not arise from insolvency, but merely from a temporary run which we had not at that time the means of supplying. The first of my creditors that were the most pressing, was Mr. Norman, of Earl street. The next was Mr. Bumford.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you recourse to Birch - A. Yes, I sent for him to become one of my bail.</p>
               <p>Q. Before you sent for him for that purpose, was there any account subsisting between you - A. Not any. He did not become my bail, but prefered to pay the debt; for which Mr. Bumford accepted a bill as security for eighty pounds four shillings. Birch agreed to the security. and Mr. Bumford gave him a bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the bill - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Bill read, drawn by Miller and Leavitt, accepted, by Bumford, and endorsed by Birch.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130052"/>Q. Is that endorsement Birch's hand writing - A. It is; eighty four pounds four shillings; but there were some little expences, the sum for which I was arrested was not so much, but the bill was drawn enough to cover the expences. I think Mr. Birch, and Mr. Bumford to the best of my reccollection, went to pay that bill. I afterwards had a communication with Birch on the state of my affairs; I told him I was affraid of being arrested by the same party; and asked him, if he could lend me the money to pay the bill which amounted to a hundred pounds. He said he had not the money, about him, but recommended me to call upon Mr. Gower: after seeing Gower, I returned to him for the purpose of seeing if he knew any body who could lend me the money. I told him I had applied to Gower, who was in company with a gentleman named Kinnaird. Mr. Kinnard said he had been making a purchase, and he did not know how he stood upon his bankers; books, but he said if I would join Birch in a bill for a hundred pounds he could give me a draft, which he did; and that bill was paid afterwards by Mr. Birch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Birch ever after that. get the hundred pounds from you - A. He had more of me; I think the bill became due in May, and some few days afterwards, I handed him the money; or he had money's worth of me.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you say, that after this you received some money - A. I received money on the 19th of May, on an annuity deed.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the person who paid you - A. Mr. Brownsworth; and my solicitor was Mr. Christie. I went to execute the annuity deed in company with my partner, Leavitt; Birch, and Reynolds a publican and builder, at that time living at Mile end; to Mr. Christie's office. Birch went with me to give security on the annuity, against my being a bankrupt in two months. I received four hundred and eighty odd pounds. Leavit, Birch and Reynolds dined with me, on the same day at the top of Fleet street. After dinner, I withdrew with Birch, into the next room; and gave him nearly the whole of the money at that time; I can't say exactly how much, but I think about four hundred pounds. After that we adjourned to Mr. Nelsons, in the neighbourhood of Temple bar; for me to assign to Birch eleved houses; and I did assign them, Mr. Nelson had been spoken to before I gave him instructions to make a lease to assign the houses over to

            . Before I went to Mr. Nelsons, I had deposited an agreement, in Birch's hands; which I executed in going to Mr. Nelson's; Mr. Birch executed part with me. About the same quantity of money that I gave him before, he returned the same sum of money to me in Nelson's presence. We then left Nelson's office, and returned to the eating house; I returned him the same money in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you return it to him again - A. I returned it to him, that he might keep it; and to draw it as I had occasion. We then parted for the day.</p>
               <p>COURT. Making him your banker - A. Yes. The next morning, I called upon him for a hundred pounds to pay the bill, with the joint acceptance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. Was that the hundred pound bill upon which Kinnaird's draft was granted - A. Yes, Birch paid it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the hundred pounds, applied to the eighty, pound four shilling bill - A. No, I went to him, and he gave me a hundred pound note to pay the eighty pounds four shilling bill with, which I went to Messrs Down, Thornton, and Co and took up the bill, kepping the overplus myself.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time did you come to any agreement or understanding of money matters - A. Yes, I told him of the state of my affairs, and told him I was involved in difficulties. He persuaded me to assign eleven more houses, besides the former eleven to him, to raise money upon them to supply my wants.</p>

               <p>Q. Was this the proposition to you - A. It was; and I took steps towards carrying it into effect; Mr. Nelson was employed to make out the instrument.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was this done - A. I think about June, and the other was about the 20th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you execute any deeds then - A. I did; and deliver them into Birch's hand.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Notice had been given to produce those deeds.</p>
               <p>Mr. Andrews. The deed was made over. Yardley made the assignment over, and the money was paid at Yardley's office.</p>
               <p>Mr. Miller. Nelson was employed to make out the ground land instrument, and Yardley was employed to make assigment to Birch, to the amount of three or four hundred pounds, paid by Birch to me; that money was part my own, and one or two of the bills were his, and one was mine. He had received about three hundred pounds of me.</p>
               <p>Q. What bill was it of yours that he paid back to you - A. On the bill of twenty pounds. After I left the office, I returned to Birch, and paid him back the money, and all the bills; not all the money, but the greater part. He was to keep it in security for me, and I was to draw it when I wanted.</p>
               <p>Q. Why was not Yardley employed to do this - A. Because he was Birch's attorney, and might be suspected.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the next application? Was it to make him owner of the property, that he might raise money for your use - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did he do it rather than yourself - A. Because I was in difficulty, and he could do it without any.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it customary for him on these occasions, to ask you for a voucher - A. Yes; he used to write it down upon a piece of paper, and make me sign it. I kept account against him, and he kept another against me.</p>
               <p>Q. After he made this proposition to you about the sureties, did you go to him again to raise money - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many houses were assigned to him - A. Twenty-two; and the value about one hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How many did you make over to him after that - A. Nineteen, and part of two.</p>
               <p>Q. What might be the value of the forty-one houses - A. About two thousand pounds; seven<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130053"/>hundred pounds were raised upon the twenty-two first houses; and that seven hundred pounds went into Birch's pocket. In the whole, I might have got of that, between two and three hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>Q. How much in the whole did you receive from Birch for all the houses - A. I don't think that I received a shilling. I received about three hundred pounds for the annuity deeds. This transaction happened previous to my bankruptcy. The last time I assigned over any of my property was on the 7th of September, 1813. After September, my affairs pressed upon me, and I had a communication with Birch.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you - A. He said the best thing would be for me to be a bankrupt; he persuaded me after that time to be a bankrupt; it was arranged two months after the 7th of September, that he should strike a docket against me, for the purpose as he said, for me to have part of the property back again, namely the houses, that I had assigned over to him. At this time, and not before, I had a communication with the prisoner Dowding, at his own house, at Mile End.</p>
               <p>Q. What induced you to go there - A. We had often met at a public-house. Birch was present, and they pursuaded me to issue out some accommodation bills; which I did, in a considerable quantity.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by accommodation bills - A. Bills which they were to give to fictitious creditors, to prove under the commission of bankruptcy, upon my estate, in order for me to procure the certificate. The property was to remain in Birch's hands, until after the bankruptcy, and then he returned to me, that I might pay such creditors as I thought proper. There were some stamps procured, some of which, I signed in blank; some Dowding wrote, and some I filled up myself; some of them were made complete, and one or two were filled up by a person named Grey, and there was another person, whom I don't know; I gave the biggest part of these bills to Dowding, for him to circulate them to different people; he was to give them to whom he thought proper; I signed one for Dufton. Dowding gave them to different people. Birch had only one to my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the description of that one - A. It was for three hundred and forty-nine pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed between you and him before you drew this bill and gave it to him - A. He told me to get a bill drawn up for him, that he might appear the biggest creditor; Dufton wrote the body of that bill, and I signed it myself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any consideration pass between you and. Birch for that bill, at that time, or before - A. None</p>
               <p>Q. Was he your debtor, or you his - A. He owed me money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards meet Birch - A. Yes; Dowding and Hughes were present.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know a man named Rigs - A. No, not until after the docket was struck, and he was to do it. We some times met at Birch's house, near Finsbury-square. It was on the 27th of November that I attended the bankruptcy at Guildhall,</p>
               <p>Q. Had you continued up to that time in your own residence, or had you removed - A. I removed on the 7th of November, from Hinton-street, to No. 7, Ropemaker's-street.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to move - A. Birch persuaded me to move, and had taken an apartment for me.</p>
               <p>Q. In what name did he take the lodgings for you, and what name did you assume - A. The name of Thompson.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of your goods - A. They were removed after I was removed, as I was told, by Birch and Dowding.</p>
               <p>Q. For what purpose did Birch remove you to this lodging - A. He advised me to keep out of the way of my creditors, that he might have a docket struck against me, and for me to keep out of the way until it was struck. I passed by the name of Thompson. Birch used to come and see me two or three times a day. He told me my goods were removed a week afterwards, and said, he assisted in removing them; he said he would keep them for me, until I got my certificate, and he would give them to me afterwards. Before I went to Guildhall, Birch and Dowding told me what had been done with some of the bills; Dowding told me he had passed them away to different persons; he said, Dufton had one and Kent had one; he told me other names, but I don't recollect them; and he had some himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there at that time, any debt owing from you to Kent, to Dufter, or to Dowding - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he name a man named Drake - A. Yes; Dowding told me Drake had a bill; Drake lived in Whitechapel, and was not a creditor of mine. I had met Birch and Dowding at Drake's house by appointment, to talk over these affairs. Dowding used some times to talk it over in Drake's presence.</p>
               <p>Q. Where and whom did you meet on the first morning that you went before the commissioners at Guildhall, on the 27th of November, or thereabouts - A. I met Dowding at Birch's, and that was before I went before the commissioners; we had some conversation. They went with me to Guildhall, and it was appointed that Dowding should meet us that morning, to go with us to Guildhall, to prove my act of bankruptcy; a man had been procured to go and prove it, but he would not go; and Dowding went into the street, and brought in a man named Nobles, who was to go before the commissioners to prove the act of bankruptcy. We all went then to Guildhall; Nobles was examined before the commissioners, but I was not present. After the examination was over, we went to an eating-house across Cheapside, and there one was speaking about the bills; but nothing was said about assignees. Birch was intended to have been an assignee from the very first. The next meeting was to be on the 4th of December; Briggs, Hughes's clerk, wrote out some depositions to prove debts. I saw several strangers with fictitious bills, which Dowding had given them. When I went to Guildhall, I saw young Dufton, Birch, Robinson, and several others offer themselves as creditors. On that day there was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130054"/>a dinner after we came from Guildhall, and Birch asked several to choose him as assignee, and Mr. Reynolds, who was not present. I understood that the persons who were to prove these fictitious bills, had make Reynolds and Birch assignees, were to have a pound a piece. Afterwards there was a conversation in my presence between Birch and Dowding, at Dowding's shop, and Birch said, if there is not enough bills, never mind a few pounds in stamps, let there be bills enough. Accordingly some more were made. Hughes thought there was not sufficient proved when we applied to him; altogether, there was about one thousand pounds worth of bills. I was not to let the just creditors prove their debts, by Birch's and Dowding's direction; and I was to say the fictitious bills were just debts; and if I was asked what consideration was given for the bills, I was to say, I lent my acceptances to Dowding and others, and they had been passed away. Those houses which I had disposed of to Birch, I was to say, he had bought, and paid for. On the meeting, on the 11th, some were proved, and some were rejected. On the third meeting, they asked me, in Birch's presence, where my residence was? and Birch interposed, and told them where I lived. I made no answer where I did live. I was previously told by Birch, not to give them a direct answer. The commissioners enquired after my books; I told them some were at Hughes's. A messenger was directed to accompany me to get them; and as I was going along, Birch stopped me, and said, he was my bail, and would not let me go; nor did I return to the commissioners; but Birch took me away. Birch paid for the dinner at the tavern, where the men who held the bills, dined. I was not at that dinner. Birch, who paid my lodging in Ropemaker's-street, said it was necessary that I should remove; which I did, to a lodging in Cripplegate, where I remained until the 6th of January, when I surrendered to the Fleet. My books at that time had not been delivered to the assignees. It was Birch that told me to go to prison. (Book put into the hands of the witness.) This is one of my account books. Here is a cash account, in which, there is an alteration made by the direction of Birch, of the sum of three hundred and ninety-six pounds nineteen shillings and sixpence, and is in my handwriting. I did not surrender my books to the commissioners, because Birch persuaded me not. (The witness now proceeded, by the direction of the counsel for the prosecution, to mark several false entries in his Book, which he had made by the direction of Birch.) I was supported in the Fleet by Birch, and after that, went to the King's Bench. After my surrender, I submitted to an examination before the commissioners, and was committed for gross prevarication, I had seven examinations, and had the assistance of counsel, Mr. Montague; for all of which expences, Birch paid.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I was twelve months in prison before I gave up the second account; and that I gave up because I saw my error.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by the prisoner Dowding. I have bought blankets of you; I know you are a cloth-draper, and had large bill transactions with you; you were in the King's Bench for one of my bills; but I believe you have got most of the money or goods for it.</p>

            . I was present at some meetings before my husband's bankruptcy, with Mr. Birch and Mr. Dowding; and heard them propose to effect the act of bankruptcy. I heard them planning about it; but I don't think they were very anxious that I should hear. I saw some of the fictitious bills made. My husband left his house on Sunday, the 7th of November, and assumed the name of Thompson. Birch came the next morning, with a young man, named Thompson, before it was day-light, and moved part of the furniture. After it was removed, I went to Ropemaker's-street. After the second meeting of the commissioners, we removed to a tobacconist's, at Cripplegate. Dowding came very frequently while we were in Ropemaker's-street. Birch supplied us with money while we were in lodgings. My husband remained in lodgings until he surrendered to the Fleet, where he was about five weeks, and in the Bench about a year. Birch supplied him with money while in confinement.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We were not intimate with Mr. Birch. I never asked him to move a bed, nor said, it would be a bad job to lie at the back of my brother-in-law; I never said to any one, I never saw any person hanged, but would make a hanging match, and go to see Birch.</p>

            . I know Birch; I saw him twelve or fourteen days before I went to Guildhall, at Dowding's house. After that, I saw them at Mr. Reynold's public-house, the Collingwood; while I was there, Dowding requested me to present a bill of Miller's. (Bill put into the hands of the witness.) This is the bill: Dowding's name is written upon it, and so is mine. I tried to pay it away. but did not succeed. Dowding asked me to go to Guildhall, to prove the act of bankruptcy. Dowding asked me to get some bills into circulation, to prove the commission of bankruptcy. I afterwards saw some bills in his hand, I suppose twenty or thirty. I can't say whether I gave bills to

I went to the meeting to prove my bill, but did not like to attempt, as I saw so many. I returned to the French Horn, and saw about thirty persons there come for dinner; some of them were persons whom I had seen at Guildhall,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130055"/>attempting to prove bills. Birch did come into the dinner room, but took Miller away with him; I saw them send Miller for his books with a messenger from Guildhall; and I saw Birch insist on taking him away, saying he was his bail. Several people made a piece of work with Dowding for their pound notes, which they were to have, for proving their fictitious bills; and particularly one Drake. Dowding said he was afraid he should have to pay all the expences, because Birch and Reynolds had not been chosen assignees, Dowding told them to hold their tongues about it; but some of them wished to have their money, and wanted to go home.</p>

I saw Dowding give to a man named Taylor, a bill for ninety seven pounds, ten shillings; which he was to prove on the estate. (Bill put into the hands of the witness.) That is the bill. (Another bill put into the hands of the witness.) That is the bill, with which I was to answer the same purpose. Dowding said it was a mere matter of form; I said it was a matter of form I did not understand, and did not like. I saw Dowding give bills to other people at the French Horn; and I went to Guildhall with them, but did not attempt to prove my bill. I afterwards went and dined with them.</p>

            . I assisted Mr. Birch in removing my brother's goods. We used to begin between five and six in the morning, before it was light. We used to leave off about a quarter before seven; some of the goods were removed to Dowding's but Birch told me to say, that they were all gone to Globe fields, and to make as much a fool of myself as I could; and to speak as broad as a countryman; some went to No. 1, Ann street, Globe fields; which was an empty house. The rest, six other loads, were taken somewhere else that I dont know; by a young man named Thompson. I afterwards received orders from Birch to break open No. 1, Ann street, as if there had been thieves; and I was to say that to Mr. Bumford, or to any of the creditors, that should ask me; I took the things out of the house, by Birch's orders, and was to say this to make it appear they had been stolen. I broke open the door with an axe, by his direction. Soon after this, my brother got into the Fleet, and I saw Birch and him looking over some accounts there, and papers; and I saw my brother sign some blank papers, by Birch's request. I have carried money from Birch to my brother; I received a paper from the commissioners summoning me to attend them, which Birch told me to lose, and not to attend. A second came, and a third came; and Birch told me not to attend until they fetched me; and then he said, I was not to know anything. Dowding also assisted me in moving the goods. Birch said if I got into prison, or any trouble, I should not long he in it; he would get me out.</p>

            . I know Miller and Leavitt, and was a creditor of theirs in November, 1813. Miller told me he was going to have a docket struck against him, and he would make it all right afterwards with me; and in consequence of that, I promised to be his friend. He asked me to attend the first meeting, and prove my debt; I was also to attend the choice of assignees; and was to chuse Birch and Reynolds. After dinner, Birch called for the bill and paid it.</p>
               <p>SAMUEL LIPTON. Being in the habit of using the French Horn public house, I got acquainted with Dowding; and one day in October, 1813, he asked me could I sell him a hundred pounds worth of cloth for a bill. I saw the bill, which was upon persons named Miller and Leavitt; and was accepted by them. I told him I did not know the parties; and afterwards he said, if I would only go and prove the bill at Guildhall he would give me a one pound note. I said you have got a hold of the wrong man; I won't do any such dirty work. He then told me not to mention it; and parted with me.</p>
               <p>MR. EDWARD BUMFORD. At the time of the dissolution of the affairs of Miller and Leavitt, I was a creditor of theirs to the amount of several hundred pounds. At the meeting of the commissioners, several persons attempted to prove bills; Mr. Sheffield as our solicitor, cross-examined them, and their proofs were rejected. Miller was asked where he then lodged, by Mr. Sheffield; he hesitated, and then said No. 2, Neck lane. He was then asked whether his books were to be found there? then Birch said, he lived at No. 7, Ropemaker street; and he took the lodging to keep him from wandering in the streets. He was again asked where his books were? and after some hesitation, he said at Hughes's his attorney's in Dean street, Fetter lane. He was then ordered to accompony Mr. Codd and me to Hughes's, to deliver up the books. On our going into the hall, we were surrounded by a number of persons, who had been offering to prove bills; amongst whom was Birch; Birch took hold of Miller's left arm and said to me, he shall not go with you, he shall go with me; I am his bail. In fact, Miller was rescued from us. I went back, and the commissioners were dispersed. I then went to Hughes's but could not get the books. I then went to No. 7, Ropemaker street, and enquired for Miller by name, but could not find him I went to Birch's also, but could not find him.</p>

On the 10th of September, the prisoner bid me good buy, saying, he was going to Woolwich to see his brother. He did not return that night; and I missed all the things, but the great coat, which I did not miss until his apprehension. In consequence of information I received, I went to a barber's shop, on the Friday following, where we found him in a back room, the door of which he had locked, and did not open it until the officer threatened to break it open. The duplicates of my property were found on the mantle-shelf. I have never seen my great coat since.</p>

My wife told me, the prisoner had robbed her of some spoons; and I received twenty-three duplicates. On the, following day, I had the prisoner apprehended. She stated that Fairbank pledged the different articles. I told her before hand, that if she confessed, it might do her an injury. She gave the residence of Fairbank, and the constable went and apprehended her. On Fairbank being apprehended, she confessed her guilt, and said, she would contribute her part towards the recovery of the articles stolen. Fairbank had assisted the other prisoner during my wife's confinement.</p>

My pocket-book was in my inside coat pocket; my coat was buttoned, and I thought it impossible to get at it. There were three five-pound notes, and eight one's in it. I saw a fire as I was coming out of the Theatre, and I went to see where it was: it was on Tower Hill, at the back of the Minories. My pocket-book was safe when I got to the Cresent; I wanted to get out of the crowd, and in a place where there was no crowd at all, the prisoner and another came just before me, and stopped me; they said, take care, sir; and there was nothing to take of. At that moment, I felt my coat torn open, and clapping my hand upon my pocket, found the pocket-book gone. I immediately seized them both, and held them for three or four minutes in the mob without any assistance; and at last I was obliged to let one go to secure the other, and I held the prisoner fast. I did not see the pocket-book pass between them.</p>

Not knowing but it might have fallen, I went round the other side of the counter; and there I saw the prisoner with something in her apron, which on examination was my muslin.

The prisoner Kelly and another man, who is not here, came up to me, and pushed my arms forward; and the man who is not here, put his hand into my breeches pocket, and took out a three shilling piece. Upon that, I took hold of them both, and the prisoners, Stagg and Cohen, and a great many others that are not here, came up to me, and made me leave go of the one that robbed me; I enquired after a constable, but nobody could tell me where to find one. The next time I saw Kelly was in the watchhouse, in the dusk of the evening, with a great coat on; and I could not then be sure of him. I was perfectly sober when I was robbed. Cohen and Stagg went to a public house afterwards; I am now sure Kelly is one of those that robbed me.</p>

As soon as we guessed he had got something from Fogram, I followed him through the crowd, going through the mob, he put whatever he had got into his breeches; as soon as he got outside of the mob, I laid hold of him: he then ducked his head; he put his hand into his breeches, and then threw down the pocket-book, and then all the papers flew about. I was obliged to beat him desperately before I could get him along. I took him to the Ram, and there the prosecutor owned the pocket-book. Here is the pocket-book.</p>

I was knocked senseless for some time; and when I got up, we went into Grays inn lane, and fought; at last he said he would not fight any more, and I ran to Hatton Garden, and got an officer.</p>

After we both got our pensions we went to the back of the College for some refreshment. Nothing happened until we got into the road, and then the prisoner came up to me and put his hand into my pocket, and took out my money. We were both rather intoxicated: I said, you have robbed me, and he immediately knocked me down. After he was taken up he said, Connelly, don't send me to prison, and here is your money back again.</p>
               <p>FREDERICK M'DOWAL. I saw the prisoner at the bar put his hand into the prosecutor's pocket and took some papers out, and then asked him where his money was? I afterwards saw the blows given. They were both intoxicated.</p>

He had one hundred and fifty pounds a year, with his board and lodging. He left me, and on his return in 1812, he did not lodge in my house. He absconded on the 12th of April last. The next time I heard of him, was by a letter, but I don't know the date, He absconded in consequence of my finding fault with the manner in which he had disposed of some money which he had been paid for some goods. He kept my accounts, and used to shew me every day by the account, the money which he had received; I found an entry of twenty pounds in cash received, but no account given of it in the books. It was his duty to account for it, if he had received it.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Machin. On the 19th of March, 1814, I see by my books, that I paid a sum of twenty pounds, on account of Mrs. Gordon. I don't know how I paid it but I know it was in Bank notes. It was paid to the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Gurney. I do not speak from my recollection of having paid this money, but from an entry in my book. We now have goods in our hands of the prisoners. Here is the entry in the day book, and here is the entry in my ledger.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that you did not pay the twenty pounds to Mrs. Gordon herself - A. I don't recollect ever paying any to Mrs. Gordon; it was not customary.</p>

               <p>Cross examined. If a payment was to be made up, the prisoner had to make up the money, and if he could not make up enough, he was to apply to me. He has now some little money due to him as salary.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130066"/>Sometimes he used to pay himself; but he then would so account for money.</p>
               <p>(A letter was now read, signed by the prisoner, and addressed to the prosecutrix, confessing his guilt, and hoping for mercy.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. From my earliest youth my exertions have been devoted for the prosecutrix The reason I parted from her, in 1812, was owing to some disgusting treatment I received from her husband's executors. When I returned, I had the absolute controul of her affairs, with the expectation of being taken into partnership, and was told to supply myself with my salary, from the money that came into my hands.</p>

            . I am clerk to the prosecutors, who served Mr. Dean, of Congleton, with stationary and other articles. On the 4th of June, the prisoner at the bar came into our shop, and enquired for Mr. Cooper, one of the partners; he said he came from his fathers at Congleton, and produced this letter; (producing a letter.) The letter stated as if from the father, that we were to deliver to the prisoner all the articles mentioned in the indictment, and the prisoner would convey them down, as he was to send a box to his mother, in which he could inclose them. Upon that order, I gave him a box of water colours, one hundred leaves of gold, one dozen packs of playing cards, nine pounds of sealing wax, a silk umbrella and a parasol. The amount was nine pounds fifteen shillings and nine pence. I let him have some of the things, for the convenience of going more safely in a box, which he said he was going to send to his mother.</p>

            . In consequence of some suspicions I entertained, I took the prisoner up stairs to his box, and told him to open it; he hesitated, and said, he had lost the key. I told him to break it open with a hammer, which he did, and I found all the articles mentioned in the indictment, in the box. I knew the flannel to be mine, for it exactly fitted a piece to which it apparently belonged, by the jaggs, and it not being cut straight. (The two pieces of flannel were here produced, compared, and appeared to correspond.) I can swear to all the articles except two remnants of corderoy. to which I cannot positively swear. (The property, except the corderoy, was here produced, and sworn to.) The bits of calico were cut out of breeches pockets, and I had a great many such. The other calico corresponds in the folds with some calico which I have by me; and to the best of my belief, all the property is mine.</p>

I went to bed last on the night of the 10th; my windows were all secure when I went to bed, and the door on the spring lock. I was alarmed between three and four in the morning; I heard the footsteps coming cautiously up stairs; it was rather day-light. I always sleep with my bed-room door a little open. Hearing footsteps, I pretended to be sleep. The prisoner came and looked at me, as I was in bed. My bed-room was on the first floor. I saw it was a tall dark man. He then went into the front room; and then returned again, as there was nothing there worth his taking; he then came and looked into my room again, and seemed to hesitate a long time; he did not come into the room, but went down stairs into the shop. I then got up cautiously, and went into the balcony, and beckoned to people in the street, telling them to come and surround the house, as there was a thief in it; I saw a young man, and asked him to go round the corner, which way the prisoner got in. When the prisoner found the house was surrounded, he went into the back parlour. threw up the window, unfastened the shutters, and jumped into the court; and in a minute he was brought in custody. When I had leisure to observe, I saw marks on the door-post as if a crow had been used, and the screws were loosened in the lock. After he was in custody, I found that two table-spoons were gone, which had been on the sideboard in the back parlour; and six tea-spoons, which had been in the same place; the table-spoons were old, and were worth about eighteen shillings; the tea-spoons might be worth three or four shillings each; and the pepper caster tops worth two or three shillings.</p>

            . On the 22nd of July, I saw the prisoner at the bar, standing on the stairs in my house; when she saw me, she came and said, I have brought you six shillings for the things you have sold this morning. I told her she must be mistaken; whilst I was talking to her, I saw my husband's great coat in a basket she had in her hand. I took her into the kitchen; and took out the coat, and then there was a black net scarf, and some candlesticks. The scarf had been in a drawer in the back first floor room; that drawer was not locked. The great coat was hanging up in that room. There were other things which were not meddled with. I sent for a constable, who is here with the property. I don't think the lace would sell for one pound; but it would be difficult to get it second hand for that money; my husband's coat is worth about one pound.</p>

            . I was robbed of my watch, on the 31st of August; I was waiting at Scandler's livery stables, for my master, whom I was going to attend to his house at Walthamstow. I went into a public-house to get some refreshment, and the prisoners followed me in; I called for a quartern of gin, and drank a little, and left the rest for the women. I then went out, and the two prisoners followed me; Dockerill laid hold of my watch, and Fogg held me while Dockerill pulled it out. I did<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="181509130070"/>not then call out; she ran down Angel-alley. I was in great fear, and pursued after her. I saw the watch drawn from my pocket, in her hand; Fogg came down the alley with us. She asked Fogg for the key, and they went into the room, which was quite dark, and locked the door upon me with them. Whilst we were in the room, I felt the watch in her hand. She pulled me down, and I cried out I wanted to get up; and she said, I had money about me, and money, by God, she must have. I won't say whether the door was properly fastened or not, I don't know. After this, Fogg and Dockerill both went out with me; and as it was late, I was obliged to go to my master, whom I found waiting for me. I have never seen my watch since.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM GILDERSFILD. A little after ten o'clock, I was told a young man had been robbed; I saw the prosecutor, and he said, two women had robbed him in the street, and he had followed them up into their room in Angel-alley, and felt the watch in one of their hands, while struggling with them. The prisoner, Fogg, was found, and taken to the watchhouse, and searched, but no watch found on her. I wanted him to go to the watchhouse; but he said, he had not time, he was obliged to go to his master.</p>

            . I am a baker, and live in the Minories. The fire broke out at a little after nine o'clock, at the back of Mr. Wilson's; I went to assist him; and when I came back, my house was full of furniture. In about ten minutes, both the prisoners came in; Howard pretended that he was a sufferer in the fire, and that almost all the furniture there was his. He asked me for an old hat; I offered him one all over flour, but he did not choose that. He asked me to lend him a one-pound note to pay the men who had been assisting him to move his goods. Pepperidge was with him, and brought in some of the things; I told him a little beer would be quite enough to give the men, and lent him five shillings; he then wanted to sleep in my house; but I could not let him do that. The next morning, they both came about eight o'clock, and claimed all the things that were there, chairs, tables, sheets, chest of drawers, and such like; they brought porters with them, with knotts, straps, and ropes, to carry every thing away. At first, I did not object to it; but soon after, the real owners came, and then it was discovered. Howard was then taken to the watchhouse, and Pepperidge went away.</p>

When I left him, there was not a creature with him in the parlour; and people could only get into that parlour through the bar. I told the landlord, he had property about him. The next time I saw him was on the landlord of the Marlborough turning him out of doors; and then I took him to the Eagle in the Kingsland-road, and there he missed his money.</p>

            . I am landlord of the Marlborough. I remember the two last witnesses coming to my house, and the prosecutor going to sleep in my back parlour. Understanding he had property, I locked the other door which goes into this room, and then a person could only get in through the bar; nobody went into the room that I know of; but the room window was open after the prosecutor was gone; and it was not open when he first went to sleep. When he went out, he wanted to go into the taproom, but I would not let him, for fear he should be robbed; and I advised him to go home, and pushed him out at the door. I then went and shut the window down, but did not think of any robbery. In consequence of information I gave at the watch-house, Lilley was apprehended, and the other prisoner afterwards, at Coventry.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Ballantyne. I remember when Lilley came into the house with Trotter, but I don't know when he went out.</p>

His mother was feeding a donkey at the door. I went in, and seeing them all whispering together about me, I guessed all was not right, I went out, and the prisoner followed me and shoved me up against the wall and held me there, while Pat Downs took a ten pound note, and a five pound note, out of my pocket. They both pushed off, and I made sail after the prisoner. I lost sight of him, so I came back, and boned the donkey. I was getting on his shoulders, when the prisoner came back, and I seized him; but he was rescued from us. He was afterwards secured, and taken to the watchhouse.</p>

            . I am a patrole. Seeing a mob in Drury lane, just by Charles street, I went to see what was the matter, and there I saw the prosecutor, trying to get a donkey on his shoulders. He said he had been robbed. Just then the prisoner came riding down the street, upon a donkey; and the prosecutor said he was the man that robbed him; and I took him into custody.</p>
               <p>WILLIAM MOLES. I was in Charles-street, Drury-lane, and saw the prosecutor trying to get a donkey on his shoulders. He said he had been robbed by the people of he house at which the donkey stood.</p>
               <p>THOMAS EDWARDS. I searched the prisoner, and took from him his money. The magistrate asked him how much he laid out, and what profit he had got, and he said he had sold all his goods for twenty-seven shillings, and that was all the money he had. When we came to count the money I took from him, there were two pounds five shillings and sixpence, and some halfpence.</p>
