                  </hi>. I am the wife. of Thomas Slocomb Black-man Maddox, and live in Smith-street, Marlborough-road, Chelsea. In June last I had two ponies at my stable for sale—the prisoner came about them three times—I cannot exactly say the first day he came, but it was in June—the last time he came was on the 26th of June—he at first said he came recommended by Mr. Hetherington, who he supplied with hay and straw, to look at the pair of ponies—he did not tell me his name the first day—he afterwards told me he was a farmer, living at St. Albans., that his name was Comber, and that he formerly lived at Silverton, in Northampton-shire he looked at the ponies—they had been looked at by a variety of persons before—he did not buy them the day—I had other parties in treaty for them at that time, and told him so—he made no offer for them then, nor on the second day—I did not tell him what the persons in treaty had offered—when he came on the 26th he said he had come to see whether I had disposed of the ponies—I told him I had not—he never had the ponies out of the stable, he only looked at them in the stall—he said if he could not buy horses from looking at them in the stall, he was not worthy of buying horses at all—he offered 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I think first—I said it was a very low offer—I wanted 70<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were thirteen hands. high, very</p>

               <p>handsome, particularly good, they were bay, without spot or blemish, black legs, manes, and tails—he said other persons might offer more money, but they would give me bills—I said bills would not be accepted, for I would either take money for my ponies, or I would keep them—he then offered 61<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I called my mother to know whether I had better let him have the ponies—she said no, I should certainly be doing wrong—I had him into the parlour—he put his hand up to his head, and said, "Well, I must have them, I will give 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, but I cannot give any more"—he said he wanted them for a lady who was returning from France, and that she was such a kind woman, the ponies would have such a good home, and they would be kept in a meadow in front of his house till she returned—I was very fond of the ponies, having had them three years—they were my husband's property—I agreed that he should have them for 62<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and also a large Newfoundland dog into the bargain—he then took out a cheque-book, and said he had a very large account in the Southwark branch of the London and Westminster bank—a great many cheques were gone from it, and it appeared to have been worn—he said he was a very large dealer in horses, that he supplied the Duke of Newcastle, Mr. Han<lb/>key, and a variety of other persons he mentioned in Wales and else-where, and he always paid in cheques, for he never carried money about with him for fear of being robbed of it—I am sorry to say this imposed upon me—he wrote the cheque, and gave it to me in my mother's presence—this now produced is it—he said that Mr. Hetherington had been kind enough to lend him a man to assist him in leading away the ponies, and that he was going with the ponies straight to Mr. Hetherington's—after unfastening the horses, he cast his eye round the stable, and asked whether I would lend him one of Peat's hunting-bridles, which was hanging up, until the Tuesday following—I lent it him, but he never returned it, and I never saw him again till he was taken into custody—before the 26th of June I had seen a man named Peter House, but I did not know at that time that it was House—I had not the least idea I had such a set about me—a man named Beament also came—I permitted the prisoner to take the ponies on receiving this cheque, and on the faith that it would be paid—I should not have parted with them, except on the belief that he had authority to draw the cheque, and that there would be money to meet it when presented—I considered it exactly as cash—I have since seen one of the ponies in the streets of Oxford, with Mr. Rack straw, an attorney, riding her—they could be ridden as well as driven—they were remarkably good-tempered and docile, from never having been knocked about or ill-treated, and yet they would go at about fourteen miles an hour.</p>

About nine o'clock, on the night of the 15th of September, I was crossing Arthur-street—the prisoner fol<lb/>lowed me—I stumbled at the curb-stone, and dropped my umbrella—the pri<lb/>soner came up, hustled me, and took out my leather purse, which contained two sovereigns—I felt her hand in my pocket, and said, "You have picked my pocket"—she said "No"—I took the purse out of her hand, and the so<lb/>vereigns were gone out of it—she ran off down by the Monument—I am sure she is the person out of whose band I took the purse.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabinet-maker, and have one partner. Sabberton was in my employ for about a twelvemonth as foreman—Hollis was a bed—i stead-maker. On the 13th of August, I went to my manufactory in Ful<lb/>wood's-rents, and missed several of these long pieces of wood—I went to Blackey, the turner, in Baldwin's-gardens, and saw some beech, which is ours—I have two thousand feet bearing the same mark with the branding-iron, it is the initials of the timber-merchant—on the 27th of August I received a communication from Mr. Blackey—in consequence of which I went to his house in Baldwin's-gardens—I waited some time, and saw a carter named Hedge remove the timber in a cart—I followed it—it was taken to Dalston, to Hollis's father's house—seeing where it was deposited, I went to the station-house—an officer came and took possession of it—I went back to my workshop and gave the prisoners in charge—Hedge went with me—when he got to my work-shop and saw the prisoners, he said, "There are the two men that employed me"—they said they had done nothing wrong—this letter is in Sabberton's handwriting I am positive—he made bills out on Saturdays—the letter was delivered to me by a woman—(<hi rend="italic">read</hi>)—" Sir,—With trembling hand I write these few lines, imploring your forgive<lb/>ness, not for the sake of myself, but for my poor wife and child. I own I am guilty of a part of the offence for which I am charged. The cause of me and Hollis taking what we did, was, when the beech was got in I came and asked you to let us have some refreshment; yon refused, and there being some over the number, in an evil moment I and Hollis took some of them, but my brother and Mr. Hollis knows no more about it than a child unborn. I have no more to say; but on my knees, let me pray that you will forgive us for the sake of my wife, for she is in the family way, and entirely dependent on me for support, and we will make every recompence in our power.—<hi rend="smallCaps">SABBERTON</hi> and <hi rend="smallCaps">HOLLIS</hi>."</p>

On the 19th of July I sent my boy—he came with twelve sets of quarterings to my house—in the afternoon the two prisoners brought some pieces with them, and they said part of the pieces the boy brought belonged to them, and not to Mr. Lyon—they both told me they belonged to them, and that they were to be turned into stumps as soon as possible—Sabberton told me I was not to mention it to George Lyon, or any other person in the shop, that the wood was in ny possession—on the 27th of August the two prisoners came—Sabberton selected some of the timber and put it on one side, and Hollis put some on the other side—Sabberton marked his with a saw, and told me to put it down in the kitchen—Hollis paid me 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the stumps I had turned—he was, to Pay me 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the three sets—he said a man was to come for them, and he did.</p>

I was standing at the corner of Jones's house, and saw the de<lb/>ceased on the opposite side of the street, boasting, and saying he had not got much fatter or thinner since he was summoned—I turned and asked if he was speaking to me—he said, "No," I turned round and saw Jones standing at his door—he was saying this to Jones—he kept going on, and putting his hand up to his face, and mimicking the goats—I thought he was making game of Jones—he came nearer to the house, and spoke to Winslow, then Winslow and Jones had some words—Caulfield went up Bailey's yard—Roberts then came and offered to stand a pot of porter if the prisoner and Winslow would not fall out, (I cannot say whether Ro<lb/>berts was sober)—Caulfield then came down the yard towards the pri<lb/>soner, and the prisoner put himself in an attitude to fight—he hit Roberta, who stood by the side of the prisoner, in the face, a back-handed blow, then went up to the prisoner, with his fist, and said he would serve him the same—Jones said he did not want to dirty his hands with him, and told him to go away—they then pushed each other, and got hold of each other—the deceased threw Jones down in the mud—Caulfield was upper-most—he caught hold of Jones round the middle, and tried to throw him, and being the smallest and weakest man, as I thought, Jones fell on the top of him—I brought Jones away, took him to his own door, and the people hallooed out that the man's leg was broken.</p>

On the 2nd of July, a few minutes after five o'clock, I saw Jones standing at his door, abusing Winslow-Roberts was with him—they both came over to Winslow's shop-door—Caulfield came up in about ten minutes—Jones said Roberts should fight Caulfield for any sum—Roberts then stood in an attitude for fighting—Caulfield put his hands up to defend himself—Jones pushed Caulfield several yards, and then a fight took place between Jones and</p>

               <p>Caulfield—they both fell down, got up, and continued fighting, they closed and both fell together, Caulfield undermost—Caulfield had no neck<lb/>kerchief on—Jones had hold of his throat and shirt with his right hand, and was going to hit him with his left—Paulding called out, "Don't hit him now he is down"—Paulding and I tried to separate them—Breeze came up, and said to Jones, "What are you doing? let go of the man"—we got him off, and Breeze took Jones away—while Jones held Caulfield by the shirt-collar, he said he would do for him—Jones was taken away be<lb/>fore he found out that the man's leg was broken—Paulding tried to raise the man up, and he said in a low voice, "Oh, dear me, my leg is broken"—Jones said, in less than a second, he wished it was his bl—y neck instead of his leg—we conveyed him. to the hospital, then came back, and was going into No. 7—Jones hallooed out to another person with me who had helped to take him to the hospital, "You long slab, I am a man that don't eat my own words, what I said, I say now, I wish I had broken his bl—y neck instead of his leg."</p>

                  </hi>. I am one of the house surgeons of St. Bartholomew's hospital. On the 2nd of July, Caulfield was brought there—I saw him about six o'clock—he had a compound fracture of the right leg—part of the bone protruded through the akin, and there was consider<lb/>able bleeding—the bones were put in their proper place, and the leg placed on the proper apparatus, but it proceeded unfavourably—a severe inflammation attacked the limb and thigh, which extended to the groin—on the 20th, large abcesses had formed, and the bones mortified—his strength was much reduced by the discharges—he became daily weaker and weaker, and it appeared in a few days he must have died—the wound had a very unhealthy appearance, and had no symptoms of healing—it was thought the best chance of saving his life was to amputate the limb, which was done by Mr. Stanley, the surgeon of the hospital—I assisted—he lived a fortnight after that, and appeared to rally for a few days, but eventually sank on the morning of the 8th of August—I examined the body after death, I found no disease to account for death, and believe he died in consequence of the injury of the leg, which I think might proceed from a fall in the way the witnesses describe.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in partnership with Andrew Caldecott, as Manchester warehousemen, in Cheapside.

                  </hi>. In March last I was clerk at the booking-office at the King's-arms, Holborn-bridge. When porters from warehouses bring parcels, they produce their parcel and delivery-book, and we sign the pro<lb/>prietor's name—if they pay the booking only we put in 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and if they pay the carriage, we put in the carriage and the booking as well—we have a book, in which we enter what parcels are paid for, but I have not got it here—this entry imports that the carriage was paid, being 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., but I only received 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. has been put in since—I signed only to the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the booking—this 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is my own figure, and the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is not—if I only receive 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. I put a stroke on the left-hand side, and I find that stroke here—1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. would be the amount charged for carriage to Bister—if I had been paid the carriage, I should have entered 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. myself in the book.</p>

When parcels were to be paid for, it was the pri<lb/>soner's duty to make the entry at the time they were sent out—if it was order<lb/>ed to be paid, it would be marked "carriage paid"—it is a most unusual thing for us to pay the carriage, nor have I any reason to believe that the package in question was ever paid for—I am quite satisfied it was not—no carriage has been charged to him in our other books—I am quite sure of that—I should expect the person to whom the goods were sent, paid the carriage—it is usual in all cases, and I know of no reason why he should not have done so in this one case—it is never the practice of the house to pay the carriage, unless it is in consequence of any neglect or omission on our part—if the porter had come back and said he had paid the carriage without being directed, the prisoner had no authority to allow the porter that.</p>

I heard a cry of "Police" in Angel-court—I went immediately, and saw the prosecutor, who was quite sober, but agitated—he complained of being robbed of 85., and his life threatened—I knocked at the door, and after some time the prisoner looked out at the two pair of stairs window—I asked her to let me in—she said she should do no such thing—I said I was determined to have her, for she had robbed the man—I asked the people of the house—they would not let me in—after considerable time I knocked the door in with a hammer, went up to her room, and called to her—she pretended to know nothing about me—I called the prosecutor up, who said she was the woman—I took her—her language going to Bow-street was most disgusting—she was searched, and two shillings and a fourpenny piece found upon her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the son of Christopher Daniel Hayes. I am a floor-cloth manufacturer, and live in Fenchurch-street, and have a factory in Hackney-road—the prisoner was my foreman for about sixteen years—he was paid by piece-work—he was able to earn from 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to 35<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—the retail business at Hackney-road was very small—the prisoner's attention was confined to that place alone—I keep no clerk there—the prisoner acted as clerk there, and I allowed him 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a week for that—he said to his private friends, and accounted to me for that, but that was a distinct account altogether—when he received orders, it was his duty to place them in the order-book, and when he received money, he put it down immediately in the cash-book—I am principally in Fenchurch-street—there was no fixed period at which he ought to account to me—it might be six weeks or longer, but it was his duty on receiving money to put it down at once—in July last I found he was drunken, and had to discharge him—he settled his accounts the following day—there was a balance of half-a-crown due to me, which I never received—I did not care about it—after he was gone, ou referring to my book, I sent out accounts to various customers—the prisoner had never accounted to me for 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received from Mr. Parnell, nor 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from Dr. Burder, nor 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Gopp—they do not appear in the cash-book—the goods were entered in the jour<lb/>nal, or I should not have found them.</p>

               <p>were left in the desk in the factory which he used—he had the key of that desk—I had the lock picked that I might open it—that was before I dis<lb/>charged him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did he not ask for an inspection of the books from you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He never did—that I swear solemnly—he called on me after he was discharged—he did not then demand that the account should be gone into—I de<lb/>manded it—he did not demand to see the state of the books—this was on the day after his discharge—I settled the cash-book, but those accounts that I charge him with embezzling I could not settle—I settled the accounts represented to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were there not books occasionally taken from the factory to Fen-church-street, and was not the prisoner left then either to trust to hit me<lb/>mory, or take slips of paper to put accounts on, and to transfer them to the books when they returned to the factory? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, but I do hot suppose that was done three times—the books were never away at Fenchurch-street for six weeks together—I took them monthly to Fenchurch-street—one of them might be there sometimes for a fortnight, but he had another book to place these things in.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not the prisoner come to you in the month of July after his dis<lb/>charge, and ask you to settle the accounts? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I swear I did not give him for answer that another time would do—he called on me on the day after his discharge, and we settled the accounts—he called on me several times afterwards—I never told him another time would do after we had settled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What did he call for? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On one occasion he called to ask if I would give him a character, and there were several things belonging to him in the place—I turned him away for drunkenness—he was away from Monday till Friday, and I wanted the books, which was the reason I opened the desk.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

DOANE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> The journal went regularly every month to Fen-church-street, and the cash-book occasionally? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—the order-book would still be left with the prisoner—it was not his duty to enter these accounts in the order-book—it was not usual to enter them there—he had a cash-book of his own besides mine—he was in the habit of entering the accounts in his own private cash-book, and then transferring them to mine.</p>

I received the prisoner in custody, on the 11th of September, from Mr. Bulworthy, a pawnbroker, in Aylesbury-street—he had a pair of white silk stockings and a pair of black at the time—I asked the prisoner where he got them—he said he bought them at Castle, Luck, and Company's, in Love-lane—he said he had been out of place three or four months, and was jobbing about the City to get a shilling—I found on him a card of his master's residence, a book, and two blue cards.</p>

On Saturday morning, the 28th of August, in consequence of receiving information, I took steps to apprehend the prisoners, and placed three policemen in Mr. Drake's house, 14, Camden Villas—on the Sunday afternoon, I saw the prisoners together, about three hundred yards from Mr. Drake's house—I think I had seen Johnson before, but I am not positive—I saw them again about half-past nine o'clock that evening in a beer-shop, about the same distance from Mr. Drake's house—I saw them go towards Mr. Drake's house—about half-past nine I found them in custody at the prosecutor's house, and they were taken to the station.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a law-agent, and live at No. 12, Hill-street, Brompton, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster—my two sisters live in the house with me. On Friday night, the 3rd of September, about half-past nine o'clock, one of my sisters was ill in bed, in the second-floor front room—about that time I heard a loud call from her room—I was in the parlour on the ground-floor—I ran up stairs and found her bed-room door open—she gave me information, in consequence of which I searched her room and the next one, which is the hack room—in the back room I found the table drawer open, and also one of the top drawers of a chest of drawers—the things in the drawer appeared in con<lb/>fusion—I went up into the attic, found the window open, and a table placed under it—there was some wet foot marks on the table and a short piece of tallow candle, which appeared as if it had been trod upon—I went down and got the assistance of a policeman, who came up stairs with me—he got out of the attic window and went along the leads—I waited a minute or two, and heard him springing his rattle—I ran down into the street and found several persons collected round the end house in the street, which was unfinished—I saw two men get over the front door of that house into the street—I then went back to my house to get a light, and in a few minutes I saw the prisoner brought out in custody of the police from the unfinished house, which is six houses from mine.</p>

I have been married to him ten years—I do not live with him—we have been separated since last April—I have one child, nine years old, who lives with me, at No. 50, Limehouse Causeway. On Tuesday, the 7th of September, I was in Oak-lane, with the child, and saw the prisoner coming up the lane—I said, "Mary Ann, here is your father coming up the lane, go and kiss him,"</p>

Do you see her?" and endeavouring to excite him, knowing his attachment to the child; that being distracted at her having the child, knowing it would be taken to improper places, he went in search of her, and met her in Oak-lane, and in the struggle to get the child from her, what she had stated occurred.

Dear Kingwell, I thought, by not appearing yesterday, it would have been much better for you. The police found me out, and took me before Mr. May, the inspector at Poplar, last night; and I was obliged to promise to attend on next Tues<lb/>day, otherwise I should have been detained until the time: and my dear Kingwell, if I do not attend, you will only be remanded until I do come forward. And after Tuesday, should you be sent for trial, deposed on it that I will raise the money, and get a counsellor for you, so that nothing shall be left undone for you; and I can vary in my statement, which will make it appear very black on my side. Do not screen me, but say my thing in your defence that will make it favourable to yourself. I hope my dear Kingwell, I hope you will endeavour to bear this trial with forti<lb/>tude; it is all for wise ends, depend on it; and it may be the means of making us happier than ever we have been. I wish you to write to your sister, and persuade her, if she is your friend, to hold her tongue, down</p>

               <p>at the office; for yesterday, again, although I was not there, she told several of the police, that she was sorry you had not (<hi rend="italic">part obliterated</hi>) and she was convinced it was your intention to do so, come out when you would; and now the police are determined to take it up next Tuesday; and under these circumstances, my dear Kingwell, we are glad to catch hold of any thing;—not that I care any thing about it, but I am afraid it mil make it worse for you. If she had not abused me on Saturday last, I should not have appeared against you; but it was galling to be called and re-called, by one that I had been a friend to, when she could not help herself; and all because I would not deny that circumstance. Now will be the time to try your friends; you will soon know who are your friends and who are not. I should be most happy if I could find any friend that would do me justice, with regard of the lies that have been told, or even a brother, that would take my part like you do hers. My dear Kingwell, you cannot be blind; you certainly must know that it is spite; and when a husband once speaks disrespectful of his wife, all the world is at once her enemy; and is it possible that a sister is nearer than a wife? even if it was the case, that will not deter me from doing all that lays in my power, for you to get your freedom again. I hope you will destroy this, and write often to me at 50, Limehouse-causeway. I still remain, dear Kingwell, yours affectionately, E. <hi rend="smallCaps">KINGWELL</hi>."</p>

About five o'clock, on the 10th of September, I saw her come in with another female to go into her own apartment—I did not see her go in, but I heard her directly she had come in, go up to her own apartment—a few minutes after I saw the other female come down, and go out—I was afterwards crossing the passage, and saw the prisoner come out of my bed-room, and go into her own room, which joins it—I went up stairs to my bed-room, and missed two boxes out of a drawer—I found the door open, with a key in it, which I had left locked, and I missed these two boxes—I immediately went to the prisoner's door, pushed it open, and saw the boxes on her table—I asked what she was doing with them, or how she got them—she said she found them on the table—I called my husband—he called a policeman, and gave her into custody—the boxes contained the articles stated in the indictment, except the rings, which were taken out of another box in the same drawer—one of them was found on the prisoner's mother, and the duplicate of the other also.</p>

I was sent to Old-street, and as I came home I met the prisoner—I knew her before—she said, "Would you go of an errand for me?"—I said, "Yes"—she then said, "Oh, what a thick pair of shoes you have got on; it is only round here; it is not far; go down the court, sit down on the step, pull off your shoes, and I will buy you a new pair of Adelaide shoes"—I said to Ellen Murphy, a little girl who was with me, "I will put my new shoes on, and you take your shoes home with you"—the prisoner took them off my feet, and then she went over the way, and never brought them back—I went home without them.</p>

On Tuesday, the 11th of September, I left the stable of my employer, in Half Moon-street, and left two coats in the coach-house, one my master's and one my own—I locked the door and took the key—I returned in three quarters of an hour, and the coats were gone—I have not found them—they had got in through the next coach-house to get them.</p>

About one or two o'clock on Tuesday afternoon I saw the prisoner with a blue coat and yellow buttons on his back over his old fustian coat—I thought at the time that it belonged to the coachman up the yard, having seen him wear such a coat—there was another roan by the side of him, who had a kind of black bag or black apron, which looked as if it had been washed out a good many times—he went through the Hoop and Grapes public-house, down Petticoat-lane.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman, and live in Wellington-place, Limehouse. On the morning in question I was passing by in my cart—I saw the prisoner pulling the prosecutor about the deck by the hair with one hand, and striking him with the other with his fist—I called out to him and told him he ought to be ashamed of himself to use the man in that way—he said the man would not work—that was what I understood him to say—I got out of my cart, which was very near to the ship, and told the prosecutor if he would come with me would take him somewhere—he was crying very much—he came down the ship's side on to the jetty—I asked him what was the matter with his arm—he said the prisoner had hit him with the handspike—I got him into the cart, took him home, gave him some breakfast, and went to the Thames-police with him—the prisoner spoke English or I should not have understood him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. The prosecutor was brought to the Thames Police. I examined him there, and saw two very severe bruises on his shoulder, which appeared to be made by some piece of wood—they were very severe blows, and were black—I got a warrant, and went to the ship next morning, in the West India Docks—I then saw the prosecutor crying on the deck—I asked for the prisoner, saw him, and told him it was a very bad case—I said, "How came you to do this?"—he said, "It was not done with the handspike, I only hit him twice with the handspike, it was done with a rope"—I am in the habit of seeing marks made with ropes at our office, and think it impossible these marks could have been made with a rope—the prosecutor made motions to me that he had been <hi rend="italic">punched</hi> with it as he was lying on deck—I examined his hack lower down, and found black marks corresponding with the end of it—I took the prisoner into custody, and took the prosecutor to the London Hospital—he had his arm braced up, and we took him to the Magistrate—he is still an out-patient of the hospital—the doctor said it would be some time before he was able to work.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Queen-street, Greenwich, and am the wife of Joseph Midmer, a greengrocer. On Thursday, the 16th of September, I heard the prisoner scolding some children, and two of mine were among them—I saw her up with her fist, and knock my little boy down—he is three years old—I ran down to take the child's part, and asked why she knocked him down—she said she would do it, and she would knock me down afterwards—I said, if she did I would make her pay for it—I then went to my own room—I had not been there long before I went out again, and she was at her own door eating some meat and bread—she had a knife in her hand—she began to abuse me, and said, "D—you, and b—you, and your children too; all your children are b—thieves"—she aggravated me till I hit her over the head with my hand, but I did not hurt her—she then pushed me against the wall, struck me, and cut me on the lip and eye with the knife she had in her hand—it was done on pur<lb/>pose—I called her a b—h, for in my passion, and the blood pouring, I was frightened—she said she knew she had cut me, and she would, for she meant to do it, for she would have my life—I tried to get the knife away from her, and a young man passed me at the time—I asked him to help me—I fell to the ground—the prisoner was rather tipsy—I had quarrelled with her before about her conduct to my children.</p>

I was in company with the prosecutor and Myers at the Yorkshire Stingo—when we were coming out, I heard the prisoner say to the prosecutor, "Will you drink?"—the prosecutor said, "No I Will not"—the prisoner said, "Will you fill this pot?"—he said, No"—the prisoner said, "Then don't, you old b—"—the prosecutor up with his hand, pushed him on one side, and said, "Go on one side, you old rogue"—the prisoner then struck him across the mouth, and made it bleed—after he had done that, he challenged him out to fight—I and Myers in<lb/>terfered, and pushed the prisoner on one side—we advised the prosecutor not to fight, but to drop it, to put up with it, and to come off home, which he did; and just by his own house he met the parties he was about to take a house for; and as we were going across the street, the prisoner overtook</p>

               <p>the prosecutor, struck him behind with his fist, and knocked him down to the ground—his friends we had just met took his part, by turning round and challenging the prisoner to fight—they did not touch him—the prisoner then went into his house, and the door was shut—he came out again in six or seven minutes, with a sword in his hand, flourishing it about, and said, "Now then, I will do for you"—he turned to the right, and was going to make a cut at a man, but he found it was not the prosecutor, and he did not strike him—he then turned round the contrary way, and found the prosecutor, cut him over the head, and felled him to the ground—he was then going to cut him again—he held the sword by the blade, and hit him with the hilt—the blade is not sharp at the edge—I saw the prosecutor covered with blood from the wound—I and two more assisted in picking him up, and conveyed him to a surgeon's in Hlackfriars-road, who dressed his wound, and we took him to the hospital—there was a great deal of blood.</p>

I will go and fetch my sword"—he came again with the sword, went up to a man, found he was not Crawford, turned away, then came and struck Crawford on the head, and knocked him down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier in the London department of the West of England Fire and Life Insurance Office, 20, New Bridge-street, Blackfriars. On the 28th of July last I received instructions from the prisoner for the insurance of property in a house No. 59, High-street, Lambeth—the Company was established at Exeter, and the Directors sit there—the policies are written in London, and sent to Exeter for the signature of three of the Directors—they are responsible for what I do in London—the instructions given me, on this occasion, were to insure 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on stock-in-trade, as a butcher, and 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on household goods and furniture, in the name of Charles Cordwent—the prisoner did not tell me his name—I thought his name was Charles Cordwent—I understood it so—I acted upon those instructions—this policy was issued by another clerk, from the instructions which I took—it was issued by our office—I know two of the signatures to the policy, and I know the attesting wit<lb/>ness—he is at Exeter, I believe—he is the Secretary of the Company—in consequence of the instructions I received, this policy was written and sent to the Directors in due course—at the time the instruc<lb/>tions were given, I made an entry in this book—a receipt is given for the money at the time the instructions are given—I received 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from the prisoner on this occasion—supposing the policy to remain in the hands of the Company, after the premium is paid, the party would be entitled to be paid that policy—we have had instances of losses occurring before the policies were issued, but the Company always pay on the receipt—I gave a receipt to the prisoner on this occasion.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You gave a piece of paper? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The usual office receipt—the Directors would pay any fair claims after thorough investiga<lb/>tion—they would feel themselves bound in honour to do so—there is no investigation before a policy is issued on small risks—we do a good deal of business at our office—I am not the only person in London who acts</p>

               <p>—the principal may do it, and the junior clerk in my absence, but not give a receipt—sometimes I may see 150 persons in the course of a day at the office—I certainly could not pledge myself to the recollection of every person who comes and effects a policy—the instructions were given on the 28th of July, and I saw the prisoner either on the 23rd or 24th of the fol<lb/>lowing month at Union-hall—he was then standing by himself as the party charged—I first saw Charles Cordwent last sessions—I cannot tell precisely the day—I saw him with other witnesses—I did not know he was Charles Cord went.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose one of the very first things you do before you pay an in<lb/>surance, is to ascertain that the person bears the name that he comes and asks to be paid in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The exact minutiae I cannot tell, because it is my duty to take insurances, not to pay claims—I have never been to the premises, and know nothing at all about the fire.</p>

The prisoner occupied the one pair back room—he is a baker—I was in the habit of calling him of an evening to go to his work; generally about a quarter to eleven o'clock—on Monday evening, the 9th of August, I was in my room, in which I can bear what is going on in the prisoner's room—about a quarter before nine I heard him come up stairs, and heard some talking in his room—I did not hear what was said—the talking did not continue more than two or three minutes—it was the butcher-boy and the prisoner—the butcher's boy went down stairs, after asking the prisoner what time he should call him—the prisoner said, when he shut up shop, about nine or half-past nine—about ten minutes before ten I called him and told him it was ten—he said, "I know it is"—I then returned to ray own room—about ten I heard him run down the stairs—I heard him speak to some one when he got to the bottom of the stairs, but I do not know who it was—I remained in my room—I am quite sure the person who ran down stairs came out of his room—I then smelt as if there was wood burning somewhere, and went down stairs—about two minutes before the prisoner went out, I had heard the cracking of wood, which I thought might be by the striking of lucifer on the wall—it was after that that I smelt fire—when I went down stairs and came to the prisoner's door, I found the flames coming from under<lb/>neath the door, and at the side of the door—the door was shut and locked, and the key was in the door, outside—I had four children up stairs, three were in bed and asleep—I got the children out of the house, after giving an alarm in the house—the butcher's boy ran out naked—the furniture in ay room is my husband's property.</p>

At the time this took place I lived at No. 59, High-street, Lambeth—I do not know the parish—I occupied the shop, parlour, and back room, first-floor—I held it of Mr. Hancock, the land-lord, who did not live in the house—I occupied the room entirely myself in which the watch and spoon were—I afterwards let the room to the pri<lb/>soner's cousin—the prisoner himself did not occupy that room at all—I let him the top-room—I remember his cousin going into Somersetshire—I saw the spoon and watch last on the 18th of July—I think it was about a month before the fire happened—the outside of the watch was metal, and the in-side silver—the spoon was silver—I kept it in a box in the parlour where I slept—I kept the box locked—I went out on Sunday, the 18th of July, my box appeared in the state in which I had seen it before—I left it un<lb/>locked—when I went out, I locked the door of my room, and put the key in my pocket, and took it with me—I am confident of that—I came home about ten o'clock—I did not see the prisoner, to my recollection, till next evening—he then asked me how I came to go out and leave the door unlocked—I said I did not, for I went and took the key from my room up stairs, and locked it myself—the fire took place on the 9th of August—I did not ascertain my loss till about the 11th of August—on looking into my box, I missed the watch and spoon—the box was locked then, but I think I left it unlocked on 18th of July, because I took the key out on the Monday morning, and locked it—I have since seen the spoon in the pos<lb/>session of Mr. Cole, and the watch in possession of a person in Black-friars-road—I believe the name is Aldous—the spoon and watch were what I kept in my box—I never authorized the prisoner to pawn them, or to go into my room, or take them—these now produced are them.</p>

On the 5th of August I rowed for a prize skiff in the Thames, off the Custom House—my colour was pink—in the fifth heat I and Radford were [about to row against each other—I know the defendants—they were all in a cutter, of which Henry James was acting as coxswain—he was in the head—whilst pre<lb/>paring to row in the last heat, I heard Henry James say, "So help you G—, so help me J—C—, if young Hipkins can win the boat, he shall not win her"—at the time he said that, all the other defendants were in the same boat with him—he spoke loud enough for them to hear—I was about a yard off at the time, or more—it was loud enough for me to hear—George James said, "You young b—, you shall have a swim for it"—he said that loud enough for the others to hear—in consequence of that I would not row, and spoke to Broughton the manager—I was afterwards induced to row, and Radford and I started—we made a false start, and were called back, as we started without the manager—we started a second time—we rowed scull to scull all the way as far as the tier, which we had to go round, and then Radford came alongside of me, put his scull against my back, and went right ahead of me—I followed him as far as Horsley-down New Stairs—I caught him there, touched him on the outside quarter, and turned him round—that was fair—I then pulled about three strokes, and got just clear of his boat, just ahead of him, when James's cutter came alongside of me, and Henry James laid hold of my boat—I asked him what he meant by laying hold of my boat—he gave me no answer—before that I heard Henry James say, "Give way," which means for the rowers to pull—he said that just as I turned Radford round—he came up along-side, laid hold of my boat just abaft the rowlock, in which the oar is, and upset my boat—my feet were in the stretcher straps—when I saw the boat going over, I got my feet out of the straps—I was thrown into the water, underneath my boat—Henry James put his arm down, laid hold of me,</p>

               <p>and hauled me over my wager-boat into his cutter, and I was taken ashore—I cannot swim—I was taken to George's Stairs, and into the George public-house—I know it was Henry James that pulled me out of the water—he was in the cutter's head—I was very bad when they got me into the boat, and said, "Pray take me home, take me home"—I was alarmed—I was confined to my bed seven days, from being in the water, and being in the heat in which I was—a doctor was sent for directly.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you start a second time, because you had fouled him at first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> We got fouling—we were not called back to start again be<lb/>cause we got foul—Henry James laid hold of my boat, and held me while the other went a-head—that was the reason we were called back, not be<lb/>cause we were fouling each other—when Henry James made use of the expressions I have stated, he was speaking to me—he said I should not have the boat—he was speaking so as I could hear him—he was not speak<lb/>ing to me, he spoke so that every body could hear him—he said, "So help you G—, so help me J—C—, if young Hipkins can win the boat, he shall not win it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Repeat that. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> "So help you G—, so help you J—C—, if you can win the boat, you shall not"—he said that publicly, in the presence of all the people there—he was in the cutter at the time—I cannot say how many heard him—we were in the middle of the river—he was in the cutter's head, and the other men were just rowing by the manager's cutter when the words were said—he was lying down in the cutter's head—the cutter was a four-oared boat—the seven defendants were in her, one forward on the look-out, one sitting down, the man steering, and four rowing—the one sitting down (Morris) was about the middle of the boat—before I started I was not cautioned by any of the defendants, or by any body, not to foul—nothing of the kind was said—I was not told that if I fouled again I should not have the boat, even if I won her—I swear that—nor any thing of the sort that I could hear—they had not charged me with fouling before I started the last time.</p>
               <p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman.

               <p>men then started—they started at first without the manager's sanction—the manager ought to have started them, but did not, and he called them back—I was in a boat waiting on Hipkins—when they started the second time, they rowed till they got to the tier—they were as nearly level as could be then—then they got entangled together till they got round in shore—they could not get clear of one another, and Radford put his scull against Hipkins's back to get off, that was in a fair wager manner, and he then got the lead—I saw Hipkins overtake him at Horsleydown New-stairs—he touched him on the outside of his stern, and turned him round—Hipkins was then just clearing Radford's boat, but had not time to get a-head of him—Henry James was behind them in a cutter waiting on Radford—I heard Henry James say, "Give way"—the men in his boat then pulled up to Hipkins's rowlock, and I saw Henry James lift up Hipkins's boat with his hands, and turn her bottom upwards—Hipkins went into the water—he went under the water, and I saw Henry James, as soon as ever he could do it, lay hold of his wrist, and drag him over his own wager-boat into James's cutter's head, and they rowed ashore with him—I should say the water was a dozen feet deep there—I did not row ashore—I saw Hipkins about an hour or an hour and a half after it happened, at home in bed, and he was ill at home seven days, from the 5th till the 11th—George James, Thomas King, Rivitt, and Cook were rowing the cutter—Morris was a sitter with a Dogget's coat and badge—he was doing nothing—Legon was steering.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JONES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A deputy corn-meter, which is in the gift of the City—I am a waterman as well, and belong to Horsleydown-stairs—Hipkins belongs to the same stairs—he and I have been very good friends, in fact I was very good friends with them all till this happened—I am not now, after using a man as they have used Hip<lb/>kins, I am not friends with them on that account—I have taken up Hipkins's part against them—I mean to convict them if I can—I have got no wager depending upon whether they will be found guilty—I swear I have not made any bet about it—I have never said I would be sure to do for the defendants, nor that they would be sure to be found guilty—all I wished was, that they should get fined or something—I would not have them sent to prison, because they have families of children—I do not want any of their money—I have said if they came forward and settled Hipkins's bill, there would be no more said about it—I never mentioned any sum—I know Mr. Keogh, a cow-keeper—I did not send him to tell the defendants if they paid the money all would be right—I take this interest about Hip<lb/>kins as a friend, that is all—I am his brother-in-law—I married his sister—it is brotherly love—I have stated before to-day, that King said "He shan't have the boat"—I have mentioned it several times since it hap<lb/>pened, in my own house, and at one or two places, and to both parties" round the stairs—nowhere else—I was examined at the Thames police-office, and before the Grand Jury—the only reason why the men started afresh, was because they started first without the manager's sanction—it was not because Radford and Hipkins fouled—they did foul, but I will swear that was not the reason they started the second time—a great many persons were present when the expressions I have named were used—I should think as many as a hundred could hear them—there were a great many about in boats and ships—there were a great many about when the</p>

               <p>boat was capsised, not a hundred—there were some hundreds on the wharfs who could see what happened—I saw Hipkins foul Radford just before the accident—he ran into Radford's starboard side—I do not know whether he went light on the canvas—his boat's stern touched Radford's hind quarters—he ran into his gunwale—not so much as five or six feet—the wager-boat was about twenty-five feet long—it was the usual size, it was very light—the canvas was drawn over as far as the fore-rowlock—that is done to prevent the water coming in—the cutter was a great deal longer than the wager-boat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How soon after Hipkins fouled Radford, did Hipkins' boat cap-size? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should think about three minutes, or from that to four—I will swear it was more than one, and more than two—James's boat came up before mine—I was about a yard from James's boat—Hipkins's boat was not a-head of Radford's when it capsized, he was about clearing his boat's stern, and then Henry James said, "Give way," the men pulled, and the boat capsized—I will swear Henry James said, "Give way," be<lb/>fore Hipkins was in the water.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why might not Radford's stern have occasioned Hipkins's boat to overturn? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Because it was not far enough forward—it was James's laying hold of the boat—Hipkins's boat was between Radford's stern and the shore—they could not have fouled so as to overturn Hipkins's boat, because Hipkins's boat was never on Radford's stern at all, nor Radford's stem on his.</p>

               <p>said, "Do you mean to start the men again?"—Broughton said, "Yes"—he said, "For what reason?"—Broughton said, "For the best of all reasons, because I have not started them yet"—Henry James then said "So help me G—, so help me J—C—, if young Hipkins wins the boat he shall not have her"—one of the party in our boat said to the manager "Did you hear that, Broughton?"—he said, "Yes, I will go and ask for an explanation," and he went to speak to Henry James—I could not hear what he said—when the men started I followed them—when they got to the tier Hipkins was rather in advance—Radford fell on his starboard side—they both came towards shore, and kept throwing their skulls about to get the lead—Radford got rather the advantage, and took the lead—Hip<lb/>kins rowed as hard as he could after him, and when they came to New Horsleydown-stairs Radford had to row his boat out a little, and Hipkins, as he was coming along, caught him on the starboard quarter—his head went round, steering out, and Hipkins endeavoured to get the lead—I then heard Henry James say, "Give way, us," and the men pulled—our cutter had orders to stop—I turned my shoulder to see the transaction—I was row<lb/>ing, and did not see any hands used, but I saw Hipkins's wager-boat go over, and he went into the water, under his boat—I saw him taken out into the defendants' cutter—he sat down, and his head dropped on his shoulder like a man dying—he looked exhausted—I saw no more of him till Monday—I did not see James turn the boat over—my back was turned—I was not in a position to see—we had orders to stop, or we should have turned him over also—I do not think Hipkins's boat could have been turned over by striking against Radford's—I have seen a number of wagers, and never saw such a thing.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman, and live in Jacob-street, Bermondsey. On the 5th of August I was about five or six feet from the boats when they came in collision—I was in my boat, lying on my sculls—I had a fare to witness the race—it took place just below Horsleydown New-stairs—there is a strong eddy there—they were rowing against tide—Radford's colour was green, Hipkins's was pink—Radford's boat was not a foot from Hipkins's—the boats are covered fore and aft—the rower sits in the midship—I saw the striking—when they came to the eddy, I saw Hipkins's boat strike Radford's close on the stern—(<hi rend="italic">here the witness placed models of three boats in different positions to explain his evidence</hi>)—Hipkins, finding his boat touch Radford's, pulled very hard—there is a strong eddy there, and it takes very little to turn a boat round—the keel of Hipkins's boat hit on Radford's stem, and was about five feet over Radford's boat—the boats did not disengage themselves—as Radford came with his boat's head down, the stern was in the eddy, and his boat came athwart, and Hipkins endeavoured to back-water with his right hand seull, to disengage his boat from Radford's, if possible—that was to bring it off—while he was in the act of backing-water his scull appeared to slip, and caused him to slip at the same time, and when he found his boat tilting over he endeavoured to stand up in it, and before he could do so the boat</p>

               <p>turned over on the larboard side—if he had succeeded, he would have cleared the boat—Radford's boat turning athwart the tide was the means of upsetting Hipkins's—his rising gave a bias to the boat—the boat was com<lb/>pletely athwart the tide, laying in and out—at that time no other boat was close to the two boats—the man was in the water before the cutter came up—it was all in a moment—the cutter might be two or three yards from the boat at the time it turned over—Hipkins's boat turned completely over and he was under it—shortly after, he came up on the upper side of the river nearest to the shore—the boat was athwart at the time it was overturned—I saw Henry James take hold of Hipkins, shawl him into his cutter and row him ashore immediately—I am certain the boat was capsized be<lb/>fore the cutter came up.</p>

I was present at the boat-race on the 5th of August, standing on my own wharf, adjoining Horsleydown New-stairs—I first saw Hipkins endeavouring to overtake Radford, which he succeeded in doing, just abreast of Horsleydown New-stairs—he then rowed his boat's head up on Radford's boat's quarter, a little before the stern, and turned him round athwart the tide; but he rowed his boat so hard on Radford's boat's quarter, that he could not extricate her, and as Radford's boat was turned round, she dragged Hipkins's boat with her athwart the tide—Hipkins endeavoured to extricate her, by backing water wits his right-hand scull, and that, in my opinion, caused it to capsize—he could not disengage his boat, and she remained there till she capsized—it took her bearings out of the water, and she had nothing to support her forward, and his backing water at the same time, tended to drag her gunwale down—in my opinion the man, finding himself going down, attempted to rise, but could not, and went over—the fore part of his boat was on the stern of the other—my attention was so riveted to this man, that I did not see what passed between him and the cutter—I saw him extricated from the water by Henry James.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a waterman. I was one of the competi<lb/>tors at the race, but not in the last heat—Radford and Hipkins were both close to one another, rowing in the eddy, till they came to Horsleydown New-stairs—the offset of tide just caught Radford's boat's head, and turned it to the north—Hipkins's boat came up, touched him on his starboard-quarter, and made him go athwart the tide—Radford's boat caught our cutter, and Hipkins was on the quarter—he tried to extricate himself off the boat's quarter, but his scull was overpowered by the tide—he slid down, and his boat filled, turned over, and he went down with it—the cut<lb/>ter then came up—the man at the head put his hand out, reached over, and dragged Hipkins out of the water right over the boat—he was in the water before the cutter came up—it was not upset by the cutter coming up against him—the cutter had nothing at all to do with it, she was not near enough—the boat was half sunk—she did not go over in the first instance, not till she got more water in her—I should say James's cutter was three galleys' length from her at the time she capsized—I did not hear the word "Give way."</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable of the Thames police—I was in a small skiff, near Mill-stairs, just below Horsleydown New-stain, and saw Hipkins coming in towards the shore—after rounding the tier Radford took the lead—I saw Hipkin let go his right-hand scull, take the left-hand scull in his two hands, and endeavour to place the blade of his scull against Radford's boat to shove him astern, which he missed, in con-sequence of that, Radford shot before him, and cleared him, and got ahead of him—I then saw Hipkins draw up towards him nearer the stairs, and in coming in the eddy, I saw Radfords boat rather shot out with the tide run<lb/>ning down with the offset of tide, with the head towards the north—at that time Hipkins touched him on his quarter, and Radford's boat's head went out athwart the tide—Hipkins seemed to pull a stroke rather harder than usual, I suppose to send him farther out to let him go by, and his boats stem went on the gunwale of Radford's boat, and Radfords boat being athwart the tide, drew Hipkins's boat athwart the tide also—his boat was off the balance, and the tide running down very strong, caused her to see on her larboard side, the strength of the tide catching the canvas was in all probability the cause of it, I saw the boat turn over immediately, and Hip<lb/>kins fell into the water—there was no other boat touching it—I saw a cutter row up towards the boat then—what cutter it was I cannot say—I took a scull, and sat down to row towards it, which prevented my seeing him taken out—Hipkins's boat was capsized, and he in the water before the cutter shot in towards him—it had nothing at all to do with capsizing the boat.</p>
