             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. Q. I believe you are a relation to the unfortunate young gentleman, who is deceased. - A. Yes; cousin.</p>
               <p>Q. I believe, on Sunday the 7th of May, you and your cousin went out together? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Be so good as state slowly all that took place on that evening? - A. We set out from Southampton-buildings, Holborn, and walked through the fields beyond <placeName id="t17970531-1-crimeloc4">White Conduit-house, towards Islington</placeName>

               <p>Q. How far had you got beyond White Conduit-house when any thing struck you as worthy of alarm? - A. To where the unfortunate accident happened, about three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Inform these gentlemen of the Jury the manner in which the accident took place? - A. When we came to the style, near which the accident happened, I observed to Mr. Fryer that I heard a noise.</p>
               <p>Q. From whence did that noise proceed? - A. From the right hand; and he stopped with me to listen; he said, there is, and immediately went over the stile to where he thought the voice proceeded from.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you from the stile when you observed to Mr. Fryer that you heard this noise? - A. About four yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Immediately upon your making that observation, Mr. Fryer went over the stile? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do when Mr. Fryer went over the stile? - A. I followed him towards the stile.</p>
               <p>Q. When you came up to the stile, what did you observe? - A. I saw a man, I think, about four yards on the other side of the stile.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean by that, that you saw the man at the time you came up to the stile, before any thing took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you an opportunity of observing him at that time? - A. Yes; Mr. Fryer asked him what he was doing; the man spoke to him, but I cannot tell what he said.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you then observe? - A. He shot him.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was Mr. Fryer to him at this time? - A. The man was quite close to him, and put the pistol under his hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean that you saw the pistol? - A. A. I saw the flash that proceeded from it, and heard the report, but did not see the pistol, because his hand was over it.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as it was fired, what was the consequence? - A. Mr. Fryer immediately fell.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he fall? - A. Into a small pond.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it on your right or your left hand? - A. On my right hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Then Mr. Fryer had his back towards you? - A. No; he stood side ways, and the man stood with his face towards me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you then an opportunity of observing his face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. The upper part of his face? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing about the lower part of his face? - A. Yes; a silk handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. How high did the silk handkerchief come up? - A. It covered his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. What then took place? - A. When Mr. Fryer fell into the pond, the man that had discharged the pistol advanced towards me, and then turned on his left towards the pond, and took the watch out of Mr. Fryer's pocket; then he came to me.</p>
               <p>Q. You had never changed your position? - A. No; I had never left the stile.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You were standing on a different side of the stile from Mr. Fryer? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Q. You were close to the stile, though you did not get over? - A. Yes; he then came up to me with a pistol, and desired me to deliver my money; my hand trembled, and I could not get to my pocket, he said, make haste, give me your money; and I gave him my purse, with some money in it; he then went off, and I got over the stile.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you got over the stile, did any thing else happen? - A. About three or four yards from the stile, I met another man; he asked me for my money, I told him I had given it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he make any reply? - A. He said, give me your cloak.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give him your cloak? - A. I do not know whether he took it, or I gave it him; and then the man, that shot Mr. Fryer, said, come on.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they both go away together? - A. He followed him, when he called to him to come on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any opportunity of observing the features of the second man? - A. I did not observe his countenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310004"/>Court. Q. Not so as to be able to know him again? - A. No, not by his countenance; his person I recollect.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Q. As accurately, as you can recollect, describe the first man? - A. He was rather inclined to be lusty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he tall or short? - A. A middle-sized man.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you first see that man again? - A. At Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners at the bar, and see if either of them is that man? - A. Yes; the shortest man in the blue coat(Clinch), I believe, from my soul, to be the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt, in your own mind, that the man in the blue coat is the man whom you observed previous to your going up to the stile, whom you saw shoot Mr. Fryer, and afterwards rob you? - A. No, I have no doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. With respect to the other man, be so good as describe him as well as you can? - A. He was a tall man, a great deal taller than the other man.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him again? - A. At Worship-street; the prisoner quite resembles him in his person, but I did not see his countenance.</p>
               <p>Q. The tallest man at the bar resembles that man? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Were these the first men that you saw, to examine whether they were the men that had committed this offence? - A. No; I saw three men at Bow-street. I was sure they were not the men; I saw them on the 16th of May, before the sitting Magistrates.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the deceased shortly after? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any wound? - A. Yes; I saw his head bloody in the field, but I did not look at the wound then, I spoke to him, but he could not answer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Const. Q. I observe you speak very positively to the person of one of those men-have you always been as certain? - A. Yes; from the first time I saw him.</p>
               <p>Q. You mean when he was in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you sufficient recollection of the persons as to describe them? - A. I did, within two days after the accident happened.</p>
               <p>Q. To whom? - A. To a relation of Mr. Fryer's, and another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Are either of these gentlemen here? - A. Yes, Mr. Brown is.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe him now? - A. The upper part of his face appeared to be very broad, and he was rather lusty.</p>
               <p>Q. If I understood you right, you said he had a silk handkerchief over his face, from his nostrils down? - A. It might be so, but I said over his mouth.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a flapped hat? - A. A round hat.</p>
               <p>Q. Therefore you could see but a small part of his face? - A. I could see half his face.</p>
               <p>Q. That part of it that was between the hat and the top of the handkerchief, no more than that? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You saw the middle part of his face? - A. I saw his eyes, and part of his forehead.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe what hair he had? - A. No, not the colour of his hair.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you take upon you now to say, whether the man, you described, had short hair or long, from your recollection, I mean? - A. I am pretty sure he had long hair.</p>
               <p>Q. The pistol you could not see? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was a dark evening? - A. No; it was a very fine evening; it had been a bad day, but it had cleared up.</p>
               <p>Q. When the flash took your attention, you could have seen the pistol? - A. No; his hand covered almost the whole of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not see any part of it, not the barrel of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember afterwards going to a public-house there, a Mr. Rice's? - A. I do not know the name, I went into a public-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Do not you remember enquiries, natural one's, being made of you, to describe the persons? - A. I do not remember that there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect being asked what kind of persons they were? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect whether you said you could not at all describe them? - A. I do not recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon you to say that you did not say so? - A. No; I was much confused.</p>
               <p>Q. You staid there, I believe, more than an hour? - A. I do not think I did stay so long; I thought that was of no service when the surgeon came; I could not give any account of it that day, not the day after.</p>
               <p>Q. You must have been quite as much confused the moment of the accident? - A. No; I was more collected, upon the instant, a great deal, than I was afterwards; I was so collected, that I sent for persons to his assistance, and for a surgeon to take care of his wound.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you, that, at the time it happened, and when Mr. Fryer lay in this disagreeable situation, you were so collected, as to observe all these circumstances, and yet afterwards, when you had disposed of him as properly as you could, you could not recollect circumstances so strongly as you had before? - A. No; I was not asked to give an account of his person, though his person was never out of my mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310005"/>Q. I am speaking of the time when Mr. Fryer received his accident? - A. I was collected enough to observe every thing that passed.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. That is, that you were more collected at the time of the accident, than you were afterwards? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Your first examination was before the Coroner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give your evidence then as accurately as now? - A. I believe I described the money I had in my pocket; I said I could not describe their features; I was asked if I should know the men; I said, I could not describe them, but I believed one was lusty, and had on a darkish coat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you use words like these, that you could not take upon you to describe either of them, but that you thought they were both lusty, and one in a dark coloured coat? - A. I believe I did not say both, I said, one was lusty; I am pretty sure I did not say both.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you take upon yourself to say, upon your oath, that you did not say they were both lusty? - A. I cannot say that I said so before the Coroner, nor I cannot say now, that they were both lusty, or that they were not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. You do not think you did say so before the Coroner, that they were both lusty? - A. No, I did not think I did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Can you take upon you to say whether before the Coroner you described their persons? - A. I cannot believe that I said they were both lusty.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. When he came up to you, you say he held a pistol to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pistol then? - A. It was something, I have no doubt it was a pistol, it was very short.</p>
               <p>Q. You only think it was a pistol, because it was very short? - A. I have no doubt it was a pistol.</p>
               <p>Q. Merely from that circumstance? - A. I saw that it was short, and I have no doubt of it; I supposed it was the pistol he had shot Mr. Fryer with.</p>

               <p>Q. Then you know it was discharged? - A. Yes, it was discharged.</p>
               <p>Q. Whatever you said before the Coroner, you signed and left it? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that after the accident happened? - A. I think it was the very next day, on the Monday.</p>
               <p>Q. The first place at which you saw these men was at Bow-street? - A. No; Worship-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you as positive to them the first time you saw them as you are now? - A. Yes, I was, indeed.</p>
               <p>Q. Then afterwards you saw them at Bow-street? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your examination taken down the first time you were there? - A. I fancy it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign it there the first time? - A. I believe I did; yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you there more than once? - A. I was there twice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you sign any deposition the second time? - A. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. These men were not taken up from any information you gave of them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You found them in custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ward. Q. You were examined before the Coroner the day after the accident? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your state of mind at that time? - A. Very much agitated of course upon such an occasion.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you as collected as you were before? - A. No. (The examination before the Coroner read.) Middlesex to wit.</p>

Before I came to the bank, across the first or second field, I saw a man on the other side; we came up to the bank, I was going to get over the bank, but on seeing the man, I drew back, and got over at another part of the bank; I crossed the lane, and came to a rail step, and crept through it, and I directly saw another man in the lane, who went up the lane, we passed by, and saw them no more.</p>
               <p>Q. Was that lane a thoroughfare or not? - A. I fancy it is no thoroughfare; if it is, it is a very private one.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing draw your attention to these men, to look at them? - A. Not particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at them? - A. I did not look at them before I came to the bank, but not so as to know them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you afterwards see any persons at Worship-street? - A. Yes; I saw two there, and I thought, to the best of my recollection, one was the person I saw go up the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe how he was dressed? - A. Not particularly; I saw the side of his face, and I thought he had carrotty hair, and his hat was rather over his face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe the dress of the other man? - A. I observed the dress of the other man more than I did of him.</p>
               <p>Q. How was he dressed? - A. He had a brown coat on and a light waistcoat; whether it was white or something mixed, I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you see any body in Court That you think at all resemble those persons? - A. (Looks at the prisoners). That man in the carrotty hair is very like the person I described, but I don't attempt to say it is; I think he is very like the persons. I saw in the lane, put I don't pretend to say it is him.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say any thing with respect to the other man? - A. I cannot say exactly, I saw both their faces, but I did not take any notice of them; it was the man with the carrotty hair that went up the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the spot where this unfortunate affair happened? - A. I have seen the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is the lane from that spot? - A. I can hardly tell, it may be upwards of 200 yards, or there abouts.</p>
               <p>Q. At what time was this? - A. It was about twenty minutes before eight, when I left my house, and it is not above ten minutes walk from my house to the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You never saw the faces of them? - A. I saw both their faces, but I did not take particular notice of them.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see them pretty plain? - A. Very plain; but I did not take that particular notice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take notice of the height of them? - A. Yes; one was taller than the other, much.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, who was the tallest? - A. Him with the red hair, him that was in the lane.</p>
               <p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. Q. I believe you were walking with your wife, from your house, in Paradise-row, on the 7th of May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In the course of that walk, did you observe any men? - A. Yes, I did; I observed two men, it was about half past seven o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe the place where you saw those two men? - A. The place was in a lane; there is a path runs across, which leads to Copenhagen-house, it is within a field or two of Paradise-row, Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the name of the lane? - A. I don't know the name of the lane.</p>
               <p>Q. You have seen the spot where this unfortunate transaction took place? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who pointed out the place to you? - A. Miss Fryer.</p>
               <p>Q. How far do you suppose the place, where you saw those two men, was from the place Miss Fryer pointed out to you? - A. Nearly two hundred yards, as near as I can imagine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it further from London or nearer? - A. Further from London. - As we were coming from Paradise-row, we observed one man standing in the lane opposite to us as we were on one side of the bank, and when we got up to the bank it was very high, and I found it was a very difficult matter to get over; I told Mrs. Goddard it would be impossible for her to get over at that place; I jumped over the bank myself, and the man turned his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310007"/>back upon me; I went round the corner to assist my wife down the bank, and I saw another man come over the stile into the lane, with red hair, a tall thin man; I then went into the next field, and lost sight of them; the one with red hair went down a little lane where there was no foot-path.</p>
               <p>Q. Has the lane a thoroughfare? - A. There is no regular foot-path, it is between two hedges.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen, since that day, any men resembling the men you saw on that day? - A. I have seen two men since these, at Mr. Floud's office, in Worship street, that very much resembled those two I saw at the bank; but I am not positive they were the men I saw at the Justice's that I saw at the bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at the prisoners? - A. I am not confident whether those men are the men; I know they are a good deal like them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the evening light? - A. At the time I saw them it was perfectly light.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever observe to any person before, or when you came to the office in Worship-street, the colour of the hair of one of the prisoners? - A. When I was asked the question I described the colour of the hair before I saw the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. You say those two men are a good deal like the men you saw near the spot? - A. I cannot say they are.</p>
               <p>Q. At this time it was light? - A. Yes, it was light.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What difference was there in the height of the two men? - A. One was a good deal taller than the other.</p>
               <p>Q. One was thinner and taller than the other? - A. One was taller than the other.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Ward. Q. You are an officer belonging to the Police-office, Worship-street? - A. Yes, I am.</p>
               <p>Q. In consequence of some information, did you apprehend either of the prisoners at the bar? - A. On the 16th of May, in consequence of an information, I, and Mr. Armstrong, and some other officers, went to the Weavers-arms, Crown-street, near Finsbury-square, and there we saw Clinch, and one Smith, that is not now at the bar; we told Smith and Clinch that we had an information against them, and they must both go to the office in Worship street; we took them to our office, and they were committed that evening upon a general charge; the next evening we went out again, in pursuit of the other person, and at the Magpie and Stump, in Sun-street, I and the other officers stopped at the door, and Armstrong went in, and brought out the prisoner Mackly, and secured him; after that they were brought up, and some people came-the first time of their examination, I believe the young lady was not there; the second time, she was.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. In point of fact, the prisoners were not apprehended for this crime? - A. Yes, that was my information; I told the Magistrates so at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Mackly was let out upon an undertaking given by some persons that he should appear? - A. I believe he was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mackly discharged in consequence of that? - A. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. That was the case the first time? - A. I don't believe it happened more than once.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner Mackly was the person who was discharged on other persons undertaking for his appearance? - A. I believe he was; but Miss Fryer had not been there at all at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. But altho' she was not there at the first time, when she did appear at the second examination, did Mackly appear? - A. Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Were you present when Miss Fryer first saw the prisoner Mackly? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that she knew him? - A. I believe she did; I have very little doubt but she did.</p>
               <p>Q. She fixed upon him immediately? - A. Yes; not positively swearing, but believing him to be the person that came up to her the second time and robbed her of her cloak, after she had been robbed by Clinch.</p>
               <p>Q. How were the prisoners situated? - A. The prisoners were all sitting in the bar with their hats on, and as soon as the Magistrates asked her the question, she directly fixed upon and swore to Clinch being the man positively; and after she had swore to them they got up from their seats, and when it came to her turn to be asked the question, she positively swore to Clinch before the Magistrates, in their hearing, close to them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. There was no property found upon the prisoners? - A. None at all, but a little money; I searched them both.</p>

               <p>Q. What are you? - A. I keep the public-house the deceased was brought to, the King's arms, the corner of Park-place.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the prosecutrix being there at the time the deceased was there? - A. I believe I was the first person that she came up to when she came across the fields; the lady said, there was a gentleman killed in the fields; I alarmed my neighbours, all that I could collect together, in the neighbourhood, and went to the spot.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation passed, while the lady was there? - A. After she returned to my house, she told me she could not tell what kind of people they were.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did she give you? - A. she told me she could not tell, that they were three young men she believed, but they had something over their faces; that she could not give any description of them; that they had something over their mouths; I told the lady it was just about the time of the Bow-street patrols coming, and I could almost answer to their being upon the spot; it proved they were there before any body returned.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. At the time the lady made use of this declaration, had she her senses or recollection about her? - A. she seemed very much agitated; I asked after that, and said, there are people about, we can dispatch them different ways, if you can give us any description of the men; she said, she certainly could not; that they had something over their faces, and had darkish coloured coats on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long might she have been in your house? - A. As much as an hour, or an hour and a half; or an hour at least.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any refreshment during the time she was in your house? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she continue in the same opinion? - A. she continued in the same opinion during the time she was in my house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. The poor lady was in great distress at that time? - A. she was; she was kept from the wounded gentleman as much as possible; I believe the surgeon was in the house within five minutes after the deceased was brought in.</p>

            , in this fact. In short, the indictment charges both of the prisoners at the bar with murder; and it is my duty to tell you, in point of law, that wherever it appears that one subject of the realm has deprived another of life, the law presumes it was malice aforethought, unless the contrary appears, and calls upon the person who kills the other, to shew there was some reason or justification for his so doing. You observe here are two persons charged, one for killing, and the other for aiding and abetting him in so killing-the law is, that if two persons or more go out on an unlawful purpose, to commit a felony, and one or the other of them kills a person, in such a way as to make it murder in him that kills, it is not only murder in him that kills, but also in all that are present, aiding, abetting, and assisting him; and it would not signify in this case, in reality, if it was to turn out in evidence before you, that Mackly was the person who committed the murder, and that Clinch was aiding and abetting; if they were there both together for an unlawful purpose, and in the prosecution so that unlawful purpose they committed the murder, they will both be equally guilty. But, however, Gentlemen, that is not a matter of distinction necessary for you to attend to here, because, if by and by, you should give such credit to the evidence, and undoubtedly, if you believe the witnesses, it clearly appears that Clinch is the man who committed the fact, and the other is the man who is stated to have been present at the time. The first question I would draw your attention to is this, whether or not, a murder has been committed? and when you have satisfied your minds that a murder has been committed, whether both or either of the prisoners at the bar were concerned or guilty of that murder? if it should turn out that one of them is not, then you will make a distinction in your verdict.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310010"/>Gentlemen, I will just state to you, in this case, one observation, and I would wish you to carry that observation in your minds throughout; you will find that this case will very much depend upon the evidence of the lady who has been examined. It generally happens, that the person robbed, is at the time of the robbery, exceedingly agitated, and, unless they are acquainted with the party robbing before-hand, it is sometimes extremely difficult afterwards to swear to the person; we all know, that an act of this sort is attended with great terrors, particularly if the person happens to be a female; one does not at all wonder at it, and for that reason, where there is only one person in company, who can speak to the fact, surely we must hear the evidence with great attention, and great distrust, not as to the honesty and fairness of the witness, but as to that sort of uncertainty in which the humane mind is frequently under in cases of fear, which may not make such an impression on the mind; for which reason I always look for, and I am very happy when I find some corroborating circumstances to shew, that the person robbed is not mistaken, as to the person of the party robbing, and if part of the property can be traced, or if any other person swears to the persons of the prisoners, or if any body can be found, that can swear that the persons charged with the robbery, were at or about the spot at the time, all these circumstances of corroboration very much deserve, nay, indeed, require the attention of a Jury.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, having said so much, I will read to you the evidence; I will now say, that the evidence, as to the identity of the prisoners, is from Miss Fryer, who was present, and then there are some witnesses called to you, and it is for you to judge how far they will corroborate her evidence; you heard her, and I am very happy to observe, that you heard her attentively; I will not make a comment on her evidence, I will simply read it, and it will be for you to judge, whether a better and more distinct account could be given by a female, under the circumstance in which she was, and under which she has now been examined.</p>
               <p>Here the learned Judge summed up the evidence, when the Jury, having retired about half an hour, returned with a verdict.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you know it to be the same when it came back from Yarmouth? - A. Yes; by its being a good deal torn, and I took particular notice of the names and number.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you recollect where it was dated from, and the sum? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Having observed all these circumstances, do you think, upon the whole, you can safely swear that this is the same note that you received from the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you any doubt about his person? - A. Not the least; as soon as the prisoner had got out, I felt a something, I cannot tell what, that led me to follow the prisoner at the bar; I immediately took my hat, and followed him through Norton falgate, up the Curtain-road, and I saw him go down a small passage; he knocked at the door, or rung the bell, I do not know which; as soon as the door was shut, I took particular notice of the house; my master carried the note to Messrs.

               <p>Q. Consequently you took no particular notice of it, but that it was a country Bank note? - A. I took particular notice that it was torn, and I took particular notice of the writing; all the names I took very particular notice of.</p>

               <p>Q. Though you had never seen the hand-writing but once, you undertake to swear positively to it? - A. I mean to swear that that is the same bill.</p>

               <p>Q. Your name was not upon it till after it came from the banker's? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Then why did you take such particular notice of the writing? - A. No farther than I had looked at it, and I knew the writing again.</p>
               <p>Q. To howmany places of the name of Yarmouth did you send? - A. Only one, in the county of Norfolk.</p>

             sworn. - On Saturday evening the 11th of March, when I came home, the circumstance of a note having been taken, goods sold, and change given, was made known to me, and the note presented to me by Thomas Hall; I had a strong suspicion that it was forged, I took particular notice of the note, and kept it until Tuesday, when I delivered it to Messrs. Harcourt and Co. bankers, Lombard-street; it was brought back to me by one of their clerks, and put into my hand; I can swear positively to its being the same note; I shewed it to the Magistrates in Worship-street, and gave it to Thomas Hall again; I did not mark it till Friday last.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to mark it then? - A. Because it was going to Yarmouth.</p>
               <p>Q. They were your goods? - A. Yes; the goods are in Court now, I can swear to the goods, they have my private mark upon them, they were found at Harriman's house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You have undertaken to tell us, that the cloth was found there, when you were not there to know any thing about it; now, I take it for granted, that you had no suspicion of this note when you sent it to your bankers? - A. I had a very strong suspicion on the Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. And yet you sent it to your banker's as a good bill? - A. I sent it in as I took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say you told the bankers you had any suspicion of it? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. It was natural enough, if a man had a suspicion, that he should tell that suspicion? - A. No, it does not follow.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you undertake to swear to that handwriting? - A. Yes; and that is the identical bill I received from my servant.</p>
               <p>Q. It must have been mixed with a good many other bills, after you had sent it to your bankers? - A. Yes; but the bankers enter every bill separately in their books, it was only twenty-four hours out of my hands, and I will swear positively, that it is the identical bill given to me by my servant, on Saturday night.</p>
               <p>Q. There was some linen found at this man's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what shape did that appear? - A. Cut up, with a private mark upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, you sell all your pieces with your private mark? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that that piece of linen, which you did not sell yourself, but was sold by your shopman, was found at the prisoner's house? - A. No; but I mean to swear that that was my piece of linen.</p>

               <p>Court. Q. Could it be worked by one person, without the assistance of the other two? - A. I cannot tell; if it could, it must be by a longer line coming from one end of the press to the other; I found a considerable quantity of saw-dust, 
and some sieves that are used to fist the saw-dust out of the halfpence, and these cloths all over grease, I do not know what they are used for.</p>

               <p>Q. Before she had said any thing of this, did you say to her that it was of no use for her to deny it? - A. I told her, I thought it would be better to confess; I can speak to both the towels, they are of a very particular manufacture, they were made in India by a friend of my own.</p>
               <p>Cross examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. I believe the prisoner was recommended to you by General Fox? - A. By Mrs Fox.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, when she came to you, she had a character? - A. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. The articles stated in the indictment, consist of towels, veal, and pork? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not your intention, originally, I believe, to have prosecuted her at this place, you intended to have prosecuted her at Hicks's-Hall? - A. I had not made up my mind; in consequence of having examined her trunks, after this, I had reason to suppose, there were things of General Fox's.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you it not, in your mind, to try her at Clerkenwell? - A. I intended to try her where I thought she would be transported, that is what I intended.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of the whole? - A. About six or seven shillings.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any agreement with the prisoner at the bar, when she came to you, about wages? - A. Yes; I agreed with her by the year.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any agreement for a month's warning, or a month's wages? - A. None; it is a rule in my family not to do it.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told her she was to go on the first of May? - A. I had.</p>
               <p>Q. How long notice had you given her of it? - A. Not above a week, or a week and two days.</p>
               <p>Q. You have paid her her wages? - A. No, I have not.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you are still indebted to her for her wages? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This night she was standing at the door? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she stand at the door all the time of the search? - A. No; she was present in the room all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she immediately taken into custody that night? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you desire her to come to your house again? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. On what day? - A. I believe, on the Monday; she did not come on the Monday, she came on the Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Q. On the Tuesday, though you had made the charge against her, she came to your house on the Tuesday? - A. Yes; I sent one of my servants for her.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she then taken into custody? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did she come? - A. in the evening.</p>
               <p>Q. Not in the morning? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And you had taken that time to consider whether you should take her into custody or not? - A. It was in consequence of finding a great number of things in her box, with the initials of Mrs. Fox upon them, and in the hopes that he would certainly come first, and prefer a bill of indictment himself</p>

               <p>Q. You have not paid her her wages even now? - A. No.</p>

               <p>Moy.

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Was not she first committed for stealing a towel? - A. She was committed for stealing the towel and the meat.</p>
               <p>Q. And she said, she had had the meat at the butcher's, and meant to pay for it? - A. She said so.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. You were set to watch the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was set to watch you? - A. Not any body that I know of.</p>
               <p>- MARLEY sworn. - I am a butcher; on Saturday morning, the 29th of April, the prisoner came to my house, and ordered some roasting beef, and a piece of neck of veal, to be sent down to Mr. Lynd's, for Mr. Lynd; Mr. Lynd sent for me, and I came down, and saw the bundle with some veal and pork in it, in the house-keeper's room.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it the same? - A. I cannot say.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear to it? - A. I think no man could do that.</p>

               <p>Q. Nor much to be wondered at, that it was in the house-keeper's room? - A. She desired it not to be put down as beef and veal, but to put it down as all beef.</p>
               <p>Q. She did take from your house a neck of veal? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. This neck of veal was to be sent to the housekeeper at Mr. Lynd's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And when you went into the house-keeper's room, there you found it? - A. Yes.</p>

I had myself bolted the door, and the shutters were fastened by a bar; we all went to bed about half past nine o'clock, when I was alarmed by the watchman; I opened the street door, and found the shutter was gone, a pane of glass broke, and the stockings that laid in the window gone; I got a light to see what mischief was done; I missed about twenty pair of silk and cotton stocking, five pair of silk and worsted, five pair of cotton and worsted, and about thirty pair all cotton; and two or three purses made of silk and cotton.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you kept it ever since? - A. No; but I am sure it is the same note; I put no particular mark upon it, I know the number was 398, it was greasy, and I took notice of the two indorsements, E. Wilkinson and Thomas Green.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he give you that note in payment for the shirts and stockings? - A. Yes; I told him I had not change to give him; he told me he was a captain of a ship, that his name was Hawse; he wrote it down, he said he lived at No. 25, Burr-street, Wapping, and desired me to send the change of the note in an hour's time, and if I did not, he would come for it, he never came for it; I gave it to the maid first to get change for it, she did not get it changed, and at eight o'clock in the evening, Mrs. Wetherall came home, and I presented her the note and the address that he gave me and she went there.</p>

Yes; a watch-maker, in Burr-street; Mr. Luck came, and I went there, and saw him; I asked him why he took me in for these things, and he said, he had given me a note for them; I asked him why he did not come for his change, and why did he give me a false address; he said, he trusted to my honour in sending the change, he was not at all uneasy about it; and he pulled another note out of his pocket, and said, here is another note for the one I gave you, is that a forged note? a gentleman behind him desired to look at it, and he said, he did not chuse to trust his property in another man's hands, and he immediately folded it up, and I did not see it afterwards.</p>

               <p>Q. It was a note upon Mr. Pybus's house? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner at any time afterwards? - A. Yes, the next day; I was sent for to Mr. Luck's, the watch-maker, I went with the servant who took the note, I asked him how he came to obtain goods from my servant upon a false note; he said, madam, if you do not like the note, give it me, and I will pay you for your shirts; I told him, I had not the note, that it was at Mr. Pybus's; there was an officer sent for, and he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he tell you where he got the note? - A. I do not recollect whether he did or not, to the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310025"/>best of my recollection he said he had taken it at Portsmouth; he called himself captain Wilson, I think.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you mean to undertake to swear merely from the circumstance of these indorsements, and the note being greasy, that this is the note you received of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Now, be so good as point out where the grease is? - A. I do not see it now, it has been in several hands, it may have got out, I know it from the number and the name.</p>

               <p>Q. You put it in your pocket, I suppose? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean positively to swear that you can recollect the number? - A. No; it is the note, No. 398.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not put it down in any book? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has it been out of your possession? - A. From the next day after I took it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it or not paid? - A. It was not; payment was refused; I left the note with Mr. Brookes, one of Pybus's clerks, who is in Court.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. I believe, all you have been saying about supposing it was a bad note, was in the absence of the prisoner? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you live in the town of Manchester, or do you reside in the country part? - A. I live about five miles out of Manchester, but I was backwards and forwards every day.</p>
               <p>Q. You suppose it requires a vast degree of respectability to draw a note of 10l.? - A. Yes, on demand.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you undertake to swear, that man's life being at stake, that there is no such person living at Manchester? - A. No, I will not.</p>

               <p>Q. There is another in Warwickshire, is not there? - A. I cannot say; there is a place called Godmanchester.</p>

            , came to me on the morning of the 5th of May, about half past ten o'clock; the produced me two pair of sheets, she wanted to pledge them for four guineas, one was calico and the other linen; I asked her whose they were, and she said, she did not know exactly; I asked her who sent her with them, and she said, a woman, which woman was a servant of the owner; I went with her to where the lived, No. 6, in Castle-court, in the Strand, and she went about half way up stairs so far as she could see the door of the one-pair of stairs room, and she said they were not there; I asked her who was not there, she made no answer, but came down stairs directly; I followed her, and she went into the shop of the woman who keeps the house, it is a chandler's shop, and enquired of her whether Mr. Burke had been there that morning, and the woman told her, he was there just now; I asked her who Mr. Burke was; says I, is he your husband, she said, he was; I asked her if the sheets belonged to him, she said, they did not, but they belonged to an acquaintance of his; I asked her then where she thought he could be, and she supposed he was at the Horse-shoe public-house, in the Strand; the prisoner and I went there, but he had not been there that morning; and in returning to her lodgings again, she pointed out her husband to me at the farther end of the court, that was the other prisoner; we walked up to him, and he was very angry with his wife for staying so long; I told him I was the cause of her staying out so long; I asked him who the sheets belonged to; he asked me, what business was that of mine; I told him it certainly was, and before he had the sheets again, I must know that he came honestly by them; I asked him where he got them, he said, of a Mr. Donovan, a Jew broker in the city; I asked him how long he had had them, and he said, five years, and that he gave twelve guineas for them; I told him I did not believe he came honestly by them, and he must go with me to Bow-street; he said, he would not go any where with me, and threatened to punish me if I stopped his property; I told him I would certainly stop him and the property too; I told him to go home with me where I had left the sheets; he said he would not go any where at all with me; I told him he certainly should go with me, and if he did not go quietly, I would alarm the neighbourhood; and after these threats, he went with me quietly, and he was committed, (the sheets produced); these are the same sheets that the woman brought to me; I afterwards went to their lodgings again; I returned with the officer from Bow-street, far the woman; I found her locked in the room up one-pair of stairs, that she took me up to before; and I left her there in custody of the officer.</p>

Hodgson and Hayter, in Seething-lane; I got some other information from Mr. Mead, and he and I, and Mr. Botheroyd, all three went and examined the vaults; over the stairs is a bulk head-way to go down into the vaults, there we perceived a water-tub that stands over the bulk head, under that were some boards, loose, that had been nailed down formerly, and we put our hands under them.</p>
               <p>Q. How many boards were there loose? - A. I cannot say; I dare say there were three or four of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take the boards up? - A. No, we left them as we found them; I went to Mrs. Haydon's and begged her to let us set up and watch in her cellar, which is directly opposite the stable, and nothing could go in without our seeing it; we did go there, myself, Mr. Mead, the Excise-surveyor, and my brother; we went about eleven at night, and about half past seven the next morning, we saw the prisoner, White, come to his mistres's stable; he unlocked the door and went in, we supposed to clean his horses, and Smith went in to him about eight o'clock, or rather before; I saw White empty the water-tub at the stable-door, and put on one side; the prisoner Smith then went out and got a light and brought in with him, and then White took the key out of the stable-door, and put the stable-door to, and shut themselves both in; I then waited a few minutes, and went out to Mr. Botheroyd, and he and I went and got a couple of constables, and I left Mr. Botheroyd and the two constables at the bottom of the court; I then went up to Mrs. Haydon's cellar and informed Mr. Mead, and then we came out, and just as we got out, the prisoner, White, opened the stable-door.</p>

               <p>Q. How long might it be from the time you saw them shut the door to that time? - A. About twenty minutes; he looked about, I suppose, to see if the coast was clear, and then he pulled the door to.</p>
               <p>Q. Then after he had satisfied himself, he went away again? - A. I fancy he saw somebody, and pulled the door to again pretty sharp; I then called to Mr. Botheroyd, and the two constables, to come up to the stable-door; they did come up, Mr. Botheroyd went to open the stable-door and there was a little resistance made.</p>
               <p>Q. From the inside, I take it for granted? - A. Yes; they then ran round as if they meant to come out at the other door of the stable; upon which Mr. Botheroyd told them if they offered to stir he would blow their brains out, he had a pistol; I was at the stable-door at the time, and saw the two prisoners in there; Mr. Crane, the constable, caught hold of one, and Mr. Jewson caught hold of the other, and made them prisoners; the prisoner, Smith, said, God bless you, forgive us, and we will pay for the rum.</p>
               <p>Q. At that time White was close by them? - A. Yes; but I did not hear any thing he said, except, upon being challenged, he denied it at first.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. This was not said till you had said something to them? - A. We had challenged them with it.</p>
               <p>Q. And you told them, one of you, that it was better to confess it? - A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you make them any promise? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you threaten them? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Did not you threaten them a good deal? - A. No; they were a great deal frightened at being detected; we challenged them that they had something, they at first denied it; and then<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310029"/>Smith said to White, you had better give it them; White said, you know where it is best; Smith then reached over to the furthest stall in the stable, and pulled out a stone bottle full of rum from amongst some trusses of straw; I then begged Mr. Mead, the Excise-surveyor, to take off the lock of the vault, that we might go down and see what they had been at.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go down when the lock was taken off? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any thing particular in the bulk-head that you have described? - A. The boards were laid on but the water-tub was not; and at the farther part of the vault, on the left-hand, there was a hogshead of rum which had been bored in the head with an implement, a kind of augur, or spike-bit, which we found in a sack in the stable, the sack was all wet at one corner with rum; we have the augur and the spike-bit here, they had put a kind of a fauset into it that was not big enough, and it was leaking very fast; and on that hogshead there were several drop of blood quite fresh, and on the ground likewise; I then called Mr. Botheroyd from up stairs, and the constables, they came and looked at it; Mr. Botheroyd then went up into the stable, I staid there five minutes to make it as sight as I could; I went up in a few minutes, into the stable, and there were the two prisoners, and the constables, and Mr. Botheroyd, and several other people; I saw Smith's little finger had been torn or cut, was very bloody, and was then bleeding; they were then taken away and secured; we went back again and found the sack, and the two implements in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Such as you suspected had been used to bore the hogshead? - A. Yes; we found nothing in the sack but a gimblet and a spike-bit.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Gurney. Q. Who is in partnership with you? - A. My mother,

On the 10th, in the morning, I went to see whether the bags were gone; I placed myself behind the chests, and about half after two o'clock in the day time, I saw a man come and take a bag of tea away from the place; I cannot say whether it was the prisoner or another man; I gave information to the assistant elder; the man was taken down to the accompting-house, it was not the prisoner, he was searched, and nothing found upon him. The prisoner came into the accompting house, while we were searching the other man, to hang up the keys of that department where the bags were that I am speaking of; the assistant elder searched the prisoner, and I saw him take two small bags of tea out of his breeches; I did not observe him to say anything then. Mr. Brookers has got the tea.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. What are you? - A. I am a commodore, to take care of the Company's business.</p>
               <p>Q. I understand you have a guinea for every prosecution? - A. I expect nothing.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, don't you expect a guinea from the East-India Company, for every man you convict? - A. I never heard of it, I can say nothing to it, I never received any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>Q. You did not see the prisoner take the tea? - A. I saw one of the two men, but I don't know which it was.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner came to hang up the keys? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear he would have been brought into the Costom-House, if he had not come? - A. The information was given against both of them.</p>

               <p>Q. Might not the man have gone out of the gate, instead of coming into the accompting house? - A. He might have attempted, but he would have been stopped.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. You were searching another man? - A. I was searching another man at the time the prisoner came into the accompting-house, I desired him to stop, I laid hold of him.</p>

            , Esq. on making an enquiry, strong suspicion fell upon the prisoner; in consequence of which, I obtained a search warrant, and searched the prisoner's lodgings, I found a great part of the things marked with Mr. Cholmely's initials, a great part of the things the prisoner looked out himself from some drawers that were in the room; he was a perfect stranger to me, his lodgings were in Whitcomb-street, Charing-Cross; I told him the occasion for which we came, he made no kind of resistance, but looked a great number of the things out himself; I have been in possession of the different articles ever since. (Produces them).</p>
               <p>Q. How came they to be in the possession of your porter? - A. They were delivered to him by my mother, they were left at my house to be delivered to Mr. Cholmely, they came by the Oxford stage.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. I believe those things were lost on Wednesday the 3d of May? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And the search warrant you did not obtain till the 4th? - A. No, it was about half past eleven in the morning.</p>
               <p>Q. There was time enough for him to have pawned the things, or to have made away with<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310033"/>them? - A. He picked them out himself from his own property.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did he give you any account how he came by the things? - A. No, he did not; he seemed very much confused.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. I am a cheesemonger, in Honey-lane-market: the prisoner came to our house a little time back, I cannot say when, I think within these three weeks; he said he had got a book of wastepaper to sell, and asked what I gave a pound; I said, two-pence a pound was the price of waste-paper.</p>
               <p>Q. Should you know it again if you saw it? - A. I do not know that I should; I think I gave him fourteen pence for it; soon after, I cannot say whether it was a week or ten days, Mr. Bolland's servant came for some butter, and I tore half a sheet of to put the butter in, and sent it to Mr. Bolland's, by his servant.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Raine. I am clerk to Mr. Bolland: I received a book from the last witness, which Dickinson, the officer, has; it was delivered to him. (Dickinson produces the book).</p>
               <p>Heptinstall. This is the book.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when any thing was said to the prisoner about the book? - A. Yes; I told him the leaf had come home on a lump of butter, and that had led to the discovery; I asked him if he had ever sold waste-paper or taken any books away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him it would be better to confess? - A I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that? - A. Yes; he denied it; he then left our house and went to breakfast; I saw him again between nine and ten o'clock; the maid-servant went and fetched the book, and I did not say any thing upon the subject, to him, till one or two o'clock; he persisted in denying that he had taken it, and I insisted upon his going to Mr. Thomas's with me; when he found that we had got the book in our possession, he said he had taken it away, and sold it to Mr. Thomas, for fourteen pence, and there the matter rested till Monday, to look over our books, to see if any thing more was missing.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the book that he said he had sold to Mr. Thomas? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Dawson). Is that the book you gave to Mr. Heptinstall? - A. Yes; it is the same that I had of Mr. Thomas.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Heptinstall). Do you know that to be Mr. Bolland's book? - A. I do, by the hand-writing, it is a day-book.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. (To Thomas). Is that the book you bought of the prisoner? - A. I cannot swear that it is, I believe it to be his.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have lived with this gentleman seven or eight years, and have been entrusted with cash and goods; I never defrauded him of a single shilling; Mr. Heptinstall has known me ever since I have lived with Mr. Bolland.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Heptinstall). Has this man had a good character with you as to honesty? - A. Yes; prior to the present time.</p>
               <p>Q. What date is this book; is it a book in constant use? - A. No; it is a book from 1781 to 1783.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it kept? - A. Amongst the other books below that were out of use.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at the prisoner, and see if that is the man? - A. That is the man; I was not certain of it when I was summoned up at first, but I am clear of it now; my horse came in, I saddled the horse, and set him off myself.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. The Captain did not tell you he was going to High Wycombe? - A. No; I understood so from Mr. Hinton, the other stable-keeper; I understood him that it was for two days, this was on the Saturday; and on Monday this letter (producing it), came down to Mr. Hinton, from Captain Harcourt, he has signed his name at the bottom of it, W. Harcourt; he never returned, and I never saw him again till he was at Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner himself tell you he was going to High Wycombe? - A. I do not recollect any thing of the kind, it is a long while ago; Mr. Hinton is here. I got the horse back again the latter end of August, or beginning of September, following; I had a letter to inform me the horse was in Smithfield; I went, and Mr. Blunt had him; they told me he belonged to Mr. Philpot, of Paddington.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. This took place at Oxford? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago? - A. The 12th of October, 1795.</p>
               <p>Q. The person, whoever he was, went to Mr. Hinton first? - A. Yes; he asked me what I valued my horse at; and I said, I could not fell him under twenty-five pounds; and he said, the mare would not do for his company, or something of that sort.</p>
               <p>Q. The prisoner replied, I believe, that he had no objection to him if he liked his paces? - A. I do not recollect; he said, if he liked him he would take him at all the money; I thought he was a gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not ask you if the horse was really your own, that you could fell it? - A. Not a word.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you tell him that he might rely upon it, the horse was your own, and you might sell it yourself? - A. No; I never said any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not, in fact, know any thing about<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310035"/>the actual hiring, as to the length of time? - A. No; I heard it from Mr. Hinton.</p>
               <p>Q. That letter, I believe, contained a note for twenty-five pounds, for the supposed value of the horse? - A. There is the letter.</p>
               <p>Q. Cannot you answer my question - Was not that the purport of the letter? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never receive a note for twenty-five pounds, a draft upon a person in town? - A. No; not any body else.</p>
               <p>Q. In that letter you were told, if he liked the horse he would keep it? - A. Yes; I heard that he had slept at Tetsworth, the first stage from Oxford.</p>
               <p>Q. That was where he had, in fact, hired the horse to go to? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. It was eighteen months from the time of the horse being hired, till you saw any thing of the horse again? - A. It might be ten or eleven months.</p>
               <p>Q. And you did not see the prisoner till a little while ago, at Bow-street? - A. I did not see him till I was summoned.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you certain he is the person? - A. Yes; I was not that night, being candle-light, but I am now positive he is the man; he has a dent in his chin.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you, over and over again, say you could not ascertain that he was the man? - A. I did not rightly understand Mr. Bond's question, I had been riding up from Oxford; I am very certain that is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not the question, over and over again, put to you by Mr. Bond? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said, over and over again, he was not the man? - A. No, I never said he was not the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Mr. Ford, another Magistrate, desire him not to put the question any more; for having denied it so many times, it was of no consequence whether you swore it now or not? - A. I did not hear him say any such thing.</p>
               <p>Q. You have had some conversations with the runners during these examinations? - A. No, only Croker; I asked him how he did, upon the steps, and that was all.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not Croker tell you there could be no doubt of his being the person? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever seen him before he hired the horse? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Now do you mean to undertake to swear, though you did not chuse to do it upon your examinations? - A. I am very positive and clear that he is the man.</p>

             sworn. - In October 1795, the prisoner applied to me at my yard, in Magple-lane, Oxford, about eleven o'clock in the day; he said, Hinton, how do you do; I told him he had the advantage of me; he said, did not I recollect him at the Angel I told him no; he asked me how my wife and family were, and I told him; then he asked me if I had a horse sit to carry him as far as Tetsworth or Wycombe; he said, he was going to meet a recruiting party that day; if they were not at Tetsworth, he should go in pursuit of them till he met them, that is to say, as far as Wycombe; I told him, I had not a horse that was capable of performing the journey; Mr. Gardiner being present in the yard, I asked him if he would like to serve the gentleman with a horse; he told him, if he would not over-ride him, he should have his horse; the gentleman wished to see the horse, but not seeing the horse, he turned round, and asked me, if I thought he was a capable horse, I told him he was; I know nothing of their agreement, I took my leave of them and went about my business, and they agreed between themselves; I afterwards saw him ride down the street, over the bridge; I should have told your Lordship, that when he was making himself known to me first, he told me he was a gentleman that I had once dressed, with a lady, at the Angel, (at that time, I followed the capacity of a hair-dresser), and I had then served him with a gig, and he paid me for it, and behaved very genteelly; at first, I doubted it, but he said so much about my serving him, that at last I had no doubt that he was the gentleman, and a gentleman of great respectability, character, and fortune.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. When you first saw him at Bow-street, you did not undertake to swear to him? - A. No; but the features of the face, the more I have thought of them, the more they occur to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that the way you usually form an opinion, that as the distance of time increases, your recollection increases? - A. No; but when a person has been absent a considerable time, you don't recollect him immediately.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you undertake to swear to him at Bow-street? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you sure he is the man? - A. I am sure he is.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alley. Q. You did not think he was the man when you saw him at Bow-street? - A. I did think he was the man, though I would not swear to him.</p>

             sworn. - About the latter end of October 1795, I believe it might be the 29th; the prisoner came to my house in Arlington-street, Piccadilly, he had been there two days; he sent<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310036"/>for me up to his apartments, he begged I would excuse the liberty he had taken with me, being a stranger; he said, he was under some very unpleasant circumstances, that he had just arrived from Chichester, with a recruiting party that had come from the West-Indies, light-dragoons; he called himself Captain Clifford; he said, he had got into a very unpleasant affray; he said, he could not think what was the matter with the people in this country, he thought they had an enmity to the army, for he and his brother officers had got into an affray, and he had almost severed one man's arm from his body; two of his brother officers were in custody, and what was very unfortunate, he had lent his servant to a party to go a shooting; he expected his servant to follow him from Guildford, that his business in town was to see his attorney, who was unfortunately out of town, and that his agent would not do any thing without money, and his request to me was, to lend him eight guineas, that he had a horse cost him twenty-five guineas, over at the Three Kings, and that the horse should remain in the stable till he had paid me the eight guineas; the story seemed very well told, and from his manner, I believed him to be what he represented himself, and I lent him the eight guineas; in about two days more, I had a second message from him; he told me then he had sent the attorney's clerk to Chichester, that he had given him all the money he had received from me, that his servant was not yet returned, and begged I would advance him the sum of three guineas more, for which he would give me a written agreement, that the horse should be at my disposal if the money was not returned, which agreement is here. (Produces it.)</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see this horse? - A. Yes; it was a black cropped horse.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Do you know whether that horse belonged to the prisoner? - A. He came and swore to it afterwards; as soon as he got the three guineas, he decamped, and left the house bill unpaid, which was six or seven pounds, he lived in a very extravagant style; I sent the horse to the Repository, to dispose of it, but there was not above eight guineas bid for it, and a friend of mine advised me to send him down to a straw-yard till the March following, and then I had him up to the Three Kings again; I sent him to Tattersall's, and there he sold for twelve guineas to Mr. Philpot, and in the month of September following, the horse was owned while Mr. Philpot was riding him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How long had you the horse in your possession? - A. From the latter end of October, 1795, till the latter end of March, 1796, the horse was then sold.</p>
               <p>Q. And what became of him afterwards, you do not know of your own knowledge? - A. Yes, I do; I was present when he was sold, he was sold to a Mr. Salmon.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it after the time you sold him to the time he was sold to Mr. Salmon? - A. I sold him to Mr. Salmon myself.</p>


               <p>Q. How many months after you sold him to Mr. Salmon, was he sold to Mr. Philpot? - A. Two months.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. With respect to the circumstance of this horse, which I hired, as has been sworn by the prosecutor: I was coming to Oxford on the 24th of October, and I asked for Mr. Hinton, from the recommendation of a person at the Bear inn, Oxford, he told me he had horses to lett; I went down and said, Hinton, have you any horses to lett? he said, my man, Mr. Gardiner, had a good horse, but did not wish to lett it out for hire, he would rather dispose of it; and, in an hour and a half, I went down to this yard, and there I found Mr. Gardiner, with the horse ready for me; I took my spurs out of my pocket, and said, I was going on the London-road to meet a Captain Winter, then of the third dragoons, who was coming to Oxford to recruit; I sent him to get me some spur leathers; when I was fixing them, he said, I do not like to let this horse go, the price, with saddle and bridle, is 25l. and I said, if I like the horse, I will send you a promissory note for the money; and as I was going out to High-Wycombe, a Mr. Fisher, of Oxford, joined company with me; unfortunately for me, I cannot learn any thing of that gentleman; I asked his opinion of the horse, and he said he did not think he was worth so much; I slept at Tetsworth that night, I could not hear any thing of Captain Winter, and I proceeded to London on the 5th morning; not hearing any thing of my friend, I went to Mr. Allen, a merchant, at Kennington, and learned that he had been, and was gone down to Chichester; I went down there with a Major Blunt, who has since been tried for an assault at Chichester; we went out together, and got into an affray from my kissing a girl in the street; it was impossible that I could, as has been stated, with only a slight stick in my hand, severe a man's arm from his body; I found there were warrants out, and, in the night, I took a place in the Chichester coach, and went to Mr. Bland's hotel; I wished to send an attorney from town, and I went after a Mr. Bevan, formerly Bevan and Mudge, but he was out of town; I then went to a Mr. Holmes, a gentleman of Arundel, and he told me he would endeavour to conciliate the matter, and for this purpose I borrowed eight guineas of Mr. Bland. Previous to my giving him that agreement, I sent for a stamp, and sent down a promissory note of 25l. payable at No. 6, Crescent, in the Minories. I never heard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310037"/>any thing further of this horse, till I was apprehended; I believe Mr. Bland knows that I have been confined in prison for debt, and got a letter of licence from my creditors, till I could get a reconciliation with my friends; Mr. Bland might have sent down to Oxford, and informed them where I was. As I am free from any intentional defraud, I trust my case to your Lordship, and the Gentlemen of the Jury.</p>

               <p>Owen. After he was pardoned to be transported for life, there was another pardon made out for him, to serve in the West-Indies as a soldier.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was placed upon the island of Martinique, having three hundred and upwards of emigrants there; I was afterwards pressed by the Grampus's boat's crew, and brought to England; we arrived on the 27th of July, and laid at Spithead for the space of a month, when an order came from the Admiralty for the ship to be paid off; the ship's crew was made over to the Ardent, and we sailed with Admiral Duncan to the North Seas.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are you in possession of this pardon; it is now alledged there was a subsequent pardon, on condition of your serving in the army?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I have nothing but what the Sheriff produced and read before us, that we were pardoned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. I have the pardon; I sent the prisoner, with forty-two more, down to Southampton.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Prisoner.) This subsequent pardon was, that in case you served in a regiment abroad, transportation for life should be removed: Now, it is necessary for you to give evidence, that you complied with that subsequent pardon, and that you were compelled to come to this country by some force which you could not resist; unless you can establish those facts I have mentioned, the original sentence upon the first part remains, you have not got the benefit of the other, unless you can prove you were brought here by force.</p>

             sworn. - I am a printer, in Aldermanbury: The prisoner was my servant, I apprehended the prisoner in consequence of an information on Saturday the 13th of May; I immediately went to his house in Bethnal-green, I found his wife there; I went into a back room, there I found a large quantity of paper, part of which paper the constable took away, a large quantity of printing types, one hundred and sixty pounds, and an Oxford Testament, part of a printed book not bound, called Mrs. Rowe's works, some spelling books, not bound, called printed paper, twenty-five quires of white demy printing paper, and four sheets of gilt post paper.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310039"/>Q. Are you able to speak to any of those articles being your property? - A. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you do with the prisoner after you had found those things? - A. I went home, and took him immediately before the Alderman; I had left him in custody of an officer at my own house. The moment he saw the officer, he acknowledged he had robbed me, and begged I would forgive him, and hoped I would consider his wife and child; I told him I could not, and ordered the constable to take him away. I had missed various things, particularly large letters that we make use of for handbills, that are stuck against the walls; there is so much paper about the house it is impossible to miss it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. Could you not tell whether you had lost paper if you took your stock? - A. We could not take our stock; I may lose a great many reams of paper and not know it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you deal pretty largely? - A. I should like to do so.</p>
               <p>Q. Possibly you might have sold that paper? - A. I never sold demy paper of that description; some of this paper was absolutely wetted, to be printed upon; and there never was a wholesale paper-maker ever sold a quite of paper ready wetted; I never heard of such a thing.</p>
               <p>Q. This man has had some dealings with you? - A. He did buy some books.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, did he not buy some demy paper of you? - A. Before he was my servant he did.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. How long has he been your servant? - A. Since Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, fell the prisoner at the bar some low demy? - A. Low demy I did fell him, to my sorrow; and several other articles, before he came into my service, to the amount of several pounds.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you not some security for it? - A. Yes; I have his father's warrant of attorney, which is not yet due.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. Had you ever sold him any types? - A. Never any.</p>

             sworn. - I am a constable: I went with Mr. Wilkins to search the prisoner's house, those are the things I found in the house; I was with the prosecutor when I found them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkins. It is proper to inform the Court, that my types are cast differently from any other printer's types in the trade; they are shorter in the shank; my predecessor, Mr. Oliver, had his types uniformly cast in that manner, and the most of the letters that are taken were formerly his, part of them have been in my possession sixteen years, and part of them are quite new. I can also speak to them by a particular nick, they are distinguished by either one, two, or three nicks.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gurney. Q. With respect to the paper, what part of that paper did you find wet? - A. There are twenty-five quires altogether, and two or three of them were wet. This printed paper is my property likewise, some is printed on one side, some on both sides; I am sure of that which is printed at my press.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence. I have bought demy paper of him, and a great quantity of spelling-books, and psalms and hymns, since I have been in his service. He has taken away some books which are not in the indictment.</p>

               <p>Q. With respect to the wet paper, did not he wet the paper himself? - A. Oh yes, he might; it is never wetted out of the house.</p>

             got upon the other step. I should have told your Lordship, that they drew the chaise a little out of the road close to the side; the prisoner, Wale, used very violent language, and asked me what I meant by cutting him; I told him I did not go to do it; he then demanded my money, watch, and pocket-book; they all three had pistols, and presented them; the prisoner, Wale kept a pistol to my head the whole time; and George Withers was on the step, on the other side, with a pistol at Mrs. Beresford's head;

             stood at the horse's head, with a pistol in his hand; the prisoner, Wale, began to search me; I told him I had no money; he then appeared to me to colour in the face; and then he put a red handkerchief which he had round his neck over the lower part of his mouth; he then searched me again, and put his hands in my waistcoat pocket, and felt upon my breeches and thighs, but did not find my money; I should have mentioned, that when he made the second search, he pushed me back in the chaise, and pulled my hat over my face.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Was that before or after he had put the handkerchief over his face? - A. Afterwards; he then reached over me to Mrs. Beresford, and tried to get the watch from her side, which he could not do, and be swore very much for a knife; and he began pulling her very hard, and by so pulling her my hat got from off my eyes, by which means I was able to see his face completely; at last he got the watch away, I saw it go.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it effected without some degree of violence on his part? - A. Very great violence; she then gave her purse to the prisoner, George Withers; he took the silver out, and a memorandum, which was in it, and gave to the prisoner, Aaron Withers, for the purpose of his looking at it; George Withers then returned the memorandum and the purse to Mrs. Beresford, and then said, go on, go on, and do not look back.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon did you see either of them again? - A. I did look back, and I observed them go along the road towards Harrow; I went to a public-house and gave information that I had been robbed, and the next day, the 2d of May, I went and lodged an information at Bow-street; the prisoners were apprehended the same day in the afternoon, and I saw them the day after, on the Wednesday, at Bow-street.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you recovered any of the property since? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. You say it was between eight and nine o'clock - had you a watch? - A. No; my wife had my watch, she had broke her own; I had seen the watch, and asked her the time, when we were at Brentford, and from the time I had been going, it must be about that time; it was a clear bright night, I believe the moon was in the first quarter.</p>

               <p>Q. You stopped after the robbery, and gave information of it? - A. Yes.</p>

               <p>Q. That is in a direction that would carry them further from Townsend's house than where they committed the robbery? - A. That depends upon which way they went; if they went strait on it would, but they might have gone to Kilburn.</p>

               <p>Q. He had cut him with a whip, I believe? - A Yes; Mr. Beresford told him, he did not mean to cut him; then Harry Wale demanded his watch, pocket-book, and money; he told him he had no watch nor pocket-book; but he began to rifle his pockets at the time; and all on a sudden, his coantenance seemed to change very red; he then drew his silk handkerchief, which he had round his neck, over the lower part of his face, it was a red silk<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310042"/>handkerchief rather dirty; he then pushed Mr. Beresford back in the chaise, took his hat off, and pulled it over his face, then rifled his pockets again; and then reached over Mr. Beresford to me, and began swearing in a very violent manner, for my watch, which Mr. Beresford said he should have; he then put his hands to the pocket-hole of my habit, and took it out of a little pocket that I had tied round my waist, he swore very violently for a knife several times; I begged him to let me untie it, and he should have the watch; it was tied with a very strong string round my waist; he got it either by breaking the string or drawing it through the knot; he pulled so violently, that he pulled me almost out of the chaise; at that time, the pistol in George Withers's hand hit me on the temple; I was afraid of it's going off, and laid hold of his hand and a part of the pistol, and begged of him to take it away; I then gave George Withers my purse; I had ten or eleven shillings in silver, and I gave him them all; then there was a little memorandum, which he took out and gave to Aaron Withers; I looked very much at Aaron Withers the whole time; Aaron Withers gave it to George, and shook his head, and then

             is the man that stood on my side, and the other was the man that stood at the horse's head.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you ever any doubt of their persons? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The observation you made when they left the chaise, was, that they were all nearly of a height? - A. Yes; except that Wale was lustier, but you will give me leave to observe, that Wale has got much thinner now than he was then.</p>
               <p>Q. He was lustier than the man who is now nearest to you? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Perhaps he has grown a little shorter too, since? - A. No; being lusty, it made him look shorter.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted, and you will tell me if I am wrong, that you were extremely alarmed? - A. I was; and I could not have believed that it could have made the impression it did make on my mind; I looked very hard at them.</p>
               <p>Q. I suppose as the men approached, and as they became violent, your fears did not lesson? - A. They came up nearly altogether.</p>
               <p>Q. But when they presented the pistols, your fright did not lessen? - A. I screamed very much for the moment; but I soon came to, and looked at them very hard.</p>
               <p>Q. Under this alarm, you observed a change of colour in Wale's face? - A. I was quite in my senses by that time.</p>
               <p>Q. You have now spoke of all three of them with great positiveness, did you at Bow-street, express yourself with the same positiveness? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Not a belief, but positively swore to them? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. If that was the case, could you by any possibility, pick out a man that turned out to be none of these three, a man of the name of Barrett, who was one of the officers of Bow-street? - A. I looked at one, rather a dark man. I thought he was the man at first, and then I turned round and said, no, there is the man that stood at the horse's head, and the officer said, you are right, ma'am, that is one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not, point to Barrett, as the man? - A. Yes; but I contradicted it instantly; I said, no, he is much like him, but this is the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not suffer these words to escape you when you pointed to Barrett, this is one of them? - A. I might, but I contradicted it; it is most likely that I did till I saw the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, or did you not? - A. I cannot recollect; I dare say I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not say when you were pointing to Barrett, this is the man? - A. I cannot say; I do recollect pointing to him; I had my doubts at the time, though I pointed to him, and that made me look round again.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you give any information at the turnpike, that you had been robbed? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after you had been robbed, was it, that you gave this account at the turnpike? - A. I cannot say, it might or it might not be a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Beresford was extremely frightened? - A. Yes; but he told me directly after that he knew the man.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect stopping at Townsend's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either you or Mr. Beresford mention that Wale was one of the men? - A. No; I did not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did either Mr. Beresford or you mention Wale's name? - A. He said he could swear to the man's voice, and that he should know him again; in a very few minutes after, he said, good God, it is

               <p>Q. Did you see either of the Withers's at your house that day? - A. Not to my knowledge; I never saw them come in at all.</p>
               <p>Q. The one mile-stone, I understood you to say, at first, was a quarter of a mile from your house? - A. Yes; the one mile-stone from London.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear positively he could not be out more than ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Across the fields to where the robbery was committed, is not above a mile? - A. It may be thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, if persons had been so inclined, they might have got the back way over the fields to that place where the robbery was committed, in less than a quarter of an hour? - A. Not to do the robbery, and come back again in the time; I am sensible they could not.</p>
               <p>Q. At all events it is much nearer to go over the fields through the church-yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many yards do you think you may cut off by going through the church-yard? - A. I suppose about two hundred yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how many times he was absent during the course of the time you say you and him were together? - A. I cannot say.</p>

               <p>Q. Was he absent two or three times? - A. He might.</p>
               <p>Q. When was he out the longest? - A. When a man was playing the rogue, and taking another man's hat off, he went out to pacify him; that was about five o'clock, and that was the only time he went out, only to make water.</p>
               <p>Q. And he was always that length of time making water, ten minutes or a quarter of an hour? - A. I cannot say; he might not be above ten minutes; I am sensible he was not out above a quarter of an hour.</p>

               <p>Q. Being so much engaged as you were, how is it possible for your to fix any particular time of their being absent, when your house was full the whole afternoon? - A. I cannot say, I never missed him.</p>

               <p>Q. You have told us every body that you recollect being in the tap-room? - A. Yes; those names that were asked me I recollected being there.</p>
               <p>Q. How many ostlers had you? - A. Two.</p>

               <p>Q. You had horses and chaises stop at your house that afternoon? - A. Yes; and one ostler was at the door, but Finch was with Wale.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any buggies? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Any taxed carts? - A. No; Finch is a man that the ostler mploys.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know where the robbery was committed? - A. I heard say it was at Chelsea-reach, but I never was there, I do not know where it is.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not know how far it is? - A. I cannot give any idea how far it is; I have heard some say a mile and a half, and others two miles.</p>

               <p>Q. You were, however, attending there? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect seeing Beadle at Mr. Darby's? - A. Yes; on Monday the 1st of May, I saw him as near as I can recollect, between three and four.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did he stay there? - A. Till half past ten, or a quarter past ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe him absent at that time? - A. I was absent myself, carrying out beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you carry out any beer? - A. Yes; I carried a pot of beer to the turnpike-gate, about a quarter after eight, as near as I can recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. When you left the house, to carry out a pot of beer to the turnpike-gate, did you observe whether Wale was in the room, or not? - A. Wale was in the room then.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned from the gate? - A. I suppose I might stop conversing at the gate, about twenty minutes: when I came back I found Wale in the tap-room again; I was ordered to take another pot of beer to the turnpike-gate, which I did, in about five minutes after, and while I was at the gate, Mr. Beresford passed; I then heard the alarm of the robbery having been committed.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you stay any time at the turnpike-gate then? - A. Not five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you returned at that time, where was Wale? - A. In the tap-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knapp. Q. So you were absent then from a quarter after eight, for about twenty minutes? - A. Yes; with the first pot.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not till you went for the second pot, that you heard of the robbery being committed? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you orders to take the first pot to the turnpike, at any particular time? - A. No; it was sent for.</p>
               <p>Q. It was nothing extraordinary for a pot of beer to be ordered on May-day? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not recollect the delivery of any other particular pot of beer that day? - A. Yes; when beer is particularly ordered.</p>
               <p>Q. But suppose it is not particularly ordered, then you do not pay an attention to the exact time when you take out every pot of beer? - A. I know that it was just at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any clock in the tap-room? - A. No; there was one in the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. But you had not gone into the parlour to look at the time? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you six any particular time that you delivered a pot of beer where there was not a previous order for it on that day? - A. I recollect perfectly well, that the eight o'clock beer had then gone out, and this first pot that I carried, went after the eight o'clock beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know either of the other prisoners? - A. Yes, I do; both of them by sight.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see them on that day? - A. I saw one, Aaron Withers.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you see him? - A. He came into the Red-lion, at pretty near ten.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he join the company of Wale? - A. I cannot say whether they drank together or not.</p>
               <p>Q. But you are sure he came into the tap-room before ten? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Beadle there? - A. I do not know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose he had started that he did not come into the tap-room, he must be wrong, and you right? - A. He did come into the tap-room, and had a pint of beer.</p>

             sworn. - I am an officer: I apprehended the girl, I got the duplicate of the watch at her mother's; I know nothing more. (The watch produced).</p>
               <p>Henry Foreman. This is my watch, my father's initials, J. F. is upon the back of it, and here is H. F. here.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence. I was in company with them three or four nights before this, and we went to an a-la-mode-beef-shop; and a night or two after that, I met with those young men in Drury-lane, and we went into a house and had something to drink, and then they went and bought us some pies, and took them to this Dark-House; he took the watch out of his pocket and put it down my bosom, and they sung two or three songs after I had the watch; he was very much in liquor at the time. I sent him a note to know if he would accept of the watch again; he said, he would not without I would give him a guinea.</p>
               <p>Court. (To Foreman.) Q. Did you offer to make this up for a guinea? - A. No; I have a gentleman here to prove it; the note said, if I would accept of half-a-guinea and the duplicate, and half-a-guinea by instalments, they would call and settle it; I would have nothing to do with it.</p>

             was nearest the fire, he was upon his legs, he had money in his hand, but whether it was a shilling or a sixpence I will not be positive, he instantly dropped it. Maurice Standford was at the left-hand side of the room, sitting at the door; but at the time I went in he instantly got up and dropped the money he had in his hand; the woman tossed the bason on the floor and broke it. Taylor, Elby, and myself, laid hold of the men in order to secure them (for they followed in a few seconds after I had burst the door open); we endeavoured to secure the men, there was some resistance, but no blows, they pushed us about but did not strike us, they put their hands in our handkerchiefs and endeavoured to get away; we secured them, and got them hand-cuffed; during the time we were struggling with the men, the woman laid hold of a bottle and run to the window, and pushed her hand against the casement window and it opened; she threw the bottle out, and some other things that she had been pretty active in throwing out, they were in parcels; there was a smart fire in the room, and upon the fire there was a gridiron, and upon the gridiron there was charcoal laid over the bars of the gridiron, and either one or the other of the parties threw the gridiron off the fire; near the fire I found some bad money, unfinished money; and the money that was in the bason that was before the woman, as much as was not thrown away, I picked up and put into my pocket; there was another bason in the room which I ordered Taylor to take the money out that was in it, (produces the money and other articles); this is the whole of the money that was in the bason, except the two or three shillings that I found by the fire-side. I also got this paper, containing these different articles, brick-dust, bread, and different things; also a cloth, which is called a scouring-cloth, which Richardson took out of the bed, and out of the cloth I took half-a-crown, three shillings pieces, and a sixpence; in that cloth there is falt, and some other articles; we found a pot in the room, with a bason with some sort of liquor in it, but in the scuffle most of the liquor was spilled, but what remained I ordered Richardson to take care of; we brought the prisoners to the Public-office, Shadwell.</p>

When I was before the Magistrates I tried the liquid in the presence of the prisoners, with a little of the falt, and the other stuff that is in this cloth, and it produced from these red blanks something exactly of the colour of shillings and sixpences; aquaforts is certainly some of the composition.</p>

            : On the 13th of April, I missed the masts mentioned in the indictment, they had been in a private dock which we made to accommodate ourselves; and, to prevent the masts going adrift, we placed an old mast, that was condemned, to hinder them going out; the dock was wet or dry, as the tide came down. On the Sunday I saw them, I marked them with my own hand, all of them; we had them from Mr. Osborn, from on board the ship Empress of Russia; Mr. Mills, the rafter's man, brought them, and he set his mark apon them; in consequence of some information I received, I went in pursuit of them; I went to a lane nearly opposite Hungerford coffee-house, and there I saw best part of the property I had lost; two of them were cut up into two foot and a half, and three foot lengths, it was on the Thursday before Good-Friday; I missed them about twelve o'clock at noon, and I got there a little after four in the afternoon; I found them on Mr. Germaine's premises; the two masts that were cut up were valued at one hundred pounds; I took Germaine into custody; I have no doubt but the short pieces of wood were part of the masts, because the number and contents all agree with my book; there is a piece in particular that has R.T. upon it, and another marked 82, which I rased with my own hand the day we bought them; there was considerably more of it upon Germaine's premises.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you search after any person you supposed to be the thief? - A. We had constables all about the town.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. The only mark you put upon it was R.T. and the contents? - A. Yes; most watermen in the river Thames know our mark; I found only two masts at Germaine's, but we lost four.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you since found those two other masts? - A. We found them the same evening made fast at Temple-stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Does not timber of this description frequently get afloat? - A. A gale of wind will occasion it often, (and we cannot guard against it); small timber, that runs from about sixteen to twenty feet long will get afloat, but not timber of such magnitude as these are.</p>
               <p>Mr. Trebeck. Q. Was it such a stormy windy night that it was impossible to prevent them getting adrift? - A. No; they were fastened to a boom, and that boom we found fast, and exactly in the situation we left it; if the boom had gone adrift, I should naturally have supposed it was caused by some accident, but the boom being made fast, I concluded they must be stolen; this is the wood I lost.</p>

               <p>Q. Was that timber brought the next tide, that Mr. Ferguson found upon your premises cutting up? - A. Yes; I paid him for the timber.</p>

You are allowed a salvage, but when you take it to those water bailiffs, you never get any thing for it; it is a common thing to see timber adrist, when I see it, I generally lay hold of it; I have taken up some hundred sticks; I am quite certain that this happened between two and three o'clock, day light was beginning to appear.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if any body had taken timber as far as Hungerford, between twelve and one o'clock that night, it could not have been that timber? - A. That I cannot swear to.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Trebeck. Q. Did he say any thing about bringing that timber from a captain of a ship? - A. He said nothing, there was another person in the boat with him, a man of the name of Wood.</p>

No; my handkerchief was whole, the holes, I am persuaded, happened in the scuffle, for he would not part with it till we got to the watch-house; he pulled extremely hard, there was a scuffle all the way to the watch-house; I think it was torn in the scuffle on purpose that I might not know it again.</p>

               <p>Q. Mrs. Watkins, I believe, parted from you? - A. At the corner of a street, in Oxford-road, Mrs. Watkins left us, and got into a Hackney-coach to go to her own house.</p>
               <p>Q. After she was gone, did you observe any thing particular about your carriage? - A. Not till we got into <placeName id="t17970531-46-crimeloc268">Hanover-square</placeName>

               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Alley. Q. How did it happen, that Mrs. Watkins's portmanteau was behind your chaise? - A. In consequence of its being very dirty, the trunk was very wet, and rather than incommode her with it, we were to take it to our house, and she was to send for it the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was it? - A. Between eight and nine in the evening, it was dark.</p>
               <p>Q. I take it for granted you could not see what was doing behind the chaise? - A. Yes; I mean to swear that I saw the trunk in the man's arms, it was fastened by myself, in Yorkshire, with leather and cords both.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether or not, in consequence of your having travelled a considerable length of way, you are able to say whether the trunk was fast when you came into town? - A. No; but at Barnet I saw it fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to undertake to swear, that when you arrived in town, the trunk was fastened or loose? - A. At Barnet, I saw it fast.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Did you see it behind the chaise in London, when you looked back? - A. Yes, I did.</p>
               <p>Mr. Const. Q. Was that the same trunk that you saw fastened at Barnet? - A. It was; the straps were cut asunder, I saw them this morning.</p>

               <p>Q. Did not you say you believed she had a white bed-gown on? - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you go farther and say that she had? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. You would not swear to her, thought you were satisfied in your mind? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. And were not you sworn to speak the truth, and the whole truth? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And you said you could not swear positively to her? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. And now you say you can swear positively to her? - A. No, I do not.</p>

             sworn. - Examined by Mr. Raine. - I am foreman to Mr. White, timber-merchant; he has got a timber-yard at Millbank, and another at Whitehall; his timber generally lies at Millbank, when it is imported.</p>
               <p>Q. Previous to this transaction, had you any quantity of Dantzick timber at your yard? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the nature of Dantzick timber? - A. It is larger than Memel or Riga timber. On Wednesday, the 1st of March, in the evening, I secured all the timber at Mill-bank, and the piece that was stole, particularly, because being broke loose by grounding upon the bank, I had the piece particularly to make fast the night before: On the 2d of March, a little after six in the morning, I was informed it was gone; I examined the place, and found the rope that had fastened it, cut, and the headfast likewise, this satisfied me that it must have been taken away with intention of stealing it; about two yards of the headfast was taken along with it, I have the remains of it, (produces it): it is cut, I searched, but could not find it any where in the river; we then had it advertised, and on Saturday morning, the 4th of March, I made search again, and I came to Lowndes and West's coal-wharf, by White-friars dock, and in consequence of information I got from the coal porters, I was directed to Mr. Wheeler's premises; when I came there, I found a piece of timber, which I had every reason to believe was the one I was looking after; I enquired of the sawyers where it came from.</p>

               <p>Q. What are the defendants? - A. Master carpenters, I understand.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout upon their premises did you find it? - A. In the saw-pit, one part of it was cutting.</p>
               <p>Q. Where are their premises? - A. In <placeName id="t17970531-49-crimeloc281">Hancock-yard, White-frairs</placeName>

               <p>Q. Does the water come up there? - A. Very near it.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Does the tide flow up there? - A. Within a very little distance of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310064"/>Mr. Raine. Q. That is in London? - A. Yes; the tide flows up by Mrs. Sargeant's premises, where there is a dock for landing goods, and these premises are not above fifty or sixty yards from it.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe this timber? - A. It was cross-cut in two pieces; one piece was cutting, and the other was lying by the side of it, in the house where the saw-pit is.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it marked before it was stolen? - A. Yes; C.W. near the contents, and C.W. at the end of it, and a P. which is the mark put on by the measures, to distinguish the ship it came from.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe these marks when you saw them at Wheeler's? - A. No; they were cut out with an adze or axe, or something of that sort, and the places where the marks had been, were daubed over with mud, so that it might not be discovered that there had been marks upon it; when I came to look at it, there was a part of the letter C still remaining.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it appear to you that this adze or axe had been applied to these parts of the timber where the letters had been? - A. It did evidently.</p>
               <p>Q. And that the letter part of the timber had been daubed with mud? - A. Yes; it appeared wet as if it was just done.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the mud fresh mud? - A. Yes; and the ends where it was cross-cut, was mudded over, that it might not appear to be fresh cross-cut.</p>
               <p>Q. You observed the timber particularly, at Wheeler's? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that was the timber stole from your master's premises? - A. Not the least.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any conversation with the defendant? - A. No particular conversation; Mr. Maton had.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. What was the length of this timber? - A. Fifty feet three inches.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is Mr. White the only importer of Dantzick timber? - A. No, I believe not; but Mr. White was the only person that had timber above Westminster-bridge at that time; one piece as thirty feet two inches, and the other is twenty feet one inch.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Are there no timber merchants above Westminster bridge, that deal in Dantzick timber? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Mr. Raine. Q. Do you happen to know for what particular purpose this timber was imported, by Mr. White? - A. Yes; for the East-India Company's warehouses.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Any person that had large buildings to erect, would require large timber as well as the East-India Company? - A. Yes; but very few buildings would require such large timber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Knowlys. Q. Are you quite sure this is Mr. White's timber? - A. I have no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the mark is remaining? - A. There is a part of the C.</p>
               <p>Q. Now might not that be a part of an O? - A. I do not think it could have been an O.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon your oath, is that part of the C as you call it, that is now remaining, such as may not have constituted a part of an O? - A. That I leave to the Gentleman of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Q. But you can tell us? - A. I believe not. (Produces a piece of timber with a similar mark upon it).</p>
               <p>Q. Now will you tell me, from that very letter, that any one part of it may not constitute a part of an O? - (Hesitates).</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Do you mean to say you always mark it in the precise way you have marked it here? - A. Nearly.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knowlys. Q. Then tell the Gentlemen of the Jury, whether there is any part of that that might not have constituted part of an O? - A. I do not think it could.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to swear that upon your oath? - A. There is nothing that has any connection with any other letter, and it has not been chopped above the top of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Upon what part of the timber is it that this part of the C remains? - A. At the end where the rope was made fast.</p>
               <p>Q. These premises of Mr. Wheeler's, are carpenter's premises, I believe? - A. I believe they are.</p>
               <p>Q. I see with what complexion you come, have you any doubt that they are? - A. No; I have not a doubt.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this remaining open to inspection? - A. Yes; because the men could not work without light.</p>
               <p>Q. It was not stowed away into any warehouse? - A. There was not time for it, it might have been consumed in another day.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to say that it might not have been slowed away between the Thursday and the Saturday? - A. No; there was an opportunity of shutting the doors, but the men could not work without light; there is the country mark remaining upon it.</p>
               <p>Q. That is common to all Dantzick timber? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Is it the W which is chipped away? - A. Yes, and the under part of the C.</p>
               <p>Q. How near is the W chopped away from the C? - A. I have not exactly measured.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there any space between this which you suppose to be a C, and the W, which remains unchopped? - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout is it marked? - A. Near the contents.</p>
               <p>Q. When it comes into the river, it is given to the person who tows it, and he puts his mark to it,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310065"/>and the mark of the ship, which was P. the contents are marked ten or fifteen see: from the end.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this mark near the contents to be seen that it is cut out? - A. It is.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the contents of the timber? - A. It was one hundred and ten feet, that is cut out likewise.</p>

               <p>Q. Those warehouses require large timber? - A. Yes; it will not do less than from sixteen to eighteen inches square; it was designed for girders.</p>
               <p>Q. On the evening of the 2d of March, had you seen this timber fastened in the way that has been described? - A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. The next day, in consequence of any information you received from Garnswaithe, did you go any where? - A. Yes, to Mr. Wheeler's saw-pit, in Hancock-yard, White-friars, that was on the Saturday in the forenoon; I saw one Diamond, a sawyer, there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand who Diamond was? - A. Yes; I took his address, and his name, from himself, because I believed him to be the thief; he was a sawyer employed by the Wheelers, and has been generally employed by them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the timber there, according to your judgement, that you had lost? - A. I think it necessary to describe the saw-pit: it has the appearance of being originally a coach-house, inclosed by a wall on each side, and the front by doors, so that the doors were obliged to be open that the sawyers might see to cut it; I examined the timber very particularly, and I found the marks had been chopped out almost entirely, and that they had very carefully daubed it over with mud; and I am sure of it for this reason, that I washed one part of it off, and then it appeared to have been done very lately; where it had been crossed by the saw it was very carefully robbed over with mud, but not so very carefully but I could distinguish the glimpse of the fresh cross cut; I then proceeded to Mr. Wheeler's, in consequence of information I had received from Diamond, and I found Mr. Joseph Wheeler; I told him that I came up in consequence of a piece of timber being in his saw-pit, and I insisted upon seeing a bill of parcels where he got it from; he said, he did not know he had such a piece of timber; I told him it was very extraordinary he should have so large a piece of timber upon his premises and not know it; and, moreover, when the men who were cutting it said, it was by his order that they were cutting it for arris-rails, for fencing, which was very improper to cut such a piece of Dantzick timber for arris-railing; he made answer, upon recollection, that he had been speaking to a Mr. Smithwaite about some timber, and he said, perhaps it might become from him, who, by-the-by, had been a timber-merchant of a few months; nothing more passed between Mr. Wheeler and I, but knowing Mr. Smithwaite, I went to him within a few hours.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they cutting it when you saw them? - A. They were cutting it into planks for arris-railing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this timber a proper thing for that sort of railing? - A. No; in the first place, it costs a great deal more money; and in the next place, there is more sawing in it, which greatly adds to the expence.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other conversation with

               <p>Q. When did you ever see the other Wheeler? - A. Not till he was taken up to Marlborough-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any doubt that that was the timber that belonged to Mr. White, that was fastened to the trees? - A. The greatest reason that strikes me is, that there is the appearance of a C. which C. I believe, I made with my own hands, and for a very particular reason.</p>
               <p>Jury. Q. Is Dantzick timber fastened to the pales by a staple, or by the timber itself, like Memel? - A. With a staple.</p>
               <p>Mr. Knapp. Q. Had you a bill of parcels with this timber? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you examined your account of the dimensions with the bill of parcels? - A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Does it correspond? - A. It does, within two inches and nine twelfths; I made that mark myself,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="179705310066"/> for a particular reason; it did not correspond with the sample that we intended, and being frosty weather I did not mark it near the contents as usual, but near the end as a private mark, in case it should go adrift, that I should be able to identify it, which is a very unusual thing to do, I marked it within a foot.</p>
               <p>Court. Q. Whenever you measure your timber you mark the contents? - A. It is always marked by the measurer employed by Government.</p>
