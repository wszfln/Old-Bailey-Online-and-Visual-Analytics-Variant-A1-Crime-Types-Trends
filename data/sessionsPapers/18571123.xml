On the morning of 11th Nov., about a quarter past 12 o'clock, I was on duty on Ludgate Hill—I saw the prisoner there, and I had seen her twice before that evening, between 10 and half past 12 o'clock—she was pulling two gentlemen about—I kept my eye upon her—I saw her take hold of Mr. Husberry by the arm, and give him a turn under the arch, and hold him there; it is the entrance to Pil<lb/>grim Street—I went down the hill and up Martin's Court, and came on them at the rear up Pilgrim Street; I found them still there—I said to the prisoner, "You are out of your latitude here, I think?"—she said, "No, sir; it is all right"—I said, "I do not think it is all right;" and I said to the prosecutor, "Is there anything amiss?"—he said, "Yes, I felt her hand in my pocket, and I have lost a sovereign and a shilling"—I said, "Will you charge her with that?"—he said, "Yes;" and I took her to the station—I kept her hand confined all the way there, that she should not make away with anything—as she was standing in the station house, I saw her fumbling her hand about under her shawl—I said, "Let me see what you have got in your hand?"—she refused to do so; I took hold of her hand, forced it open, and found in it a sovereign, three sixpences, two halfpence, and a farthing—she was afterwards searched by the female searcher, who produced to me an empty purse and a latch key.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sub warder of Cold Bath Fields Prison. I was on duty at a quarter to 7 o'clock on Wednesday morning, 11th Nov., in the gallery passage; my duty was to see the prisoners pass down the respective wards, and prevent them communicating with each other—I saw the prisoner leave his cell—he had his cell pot in his hand, in the usual manner—here is one of them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—they are all made on one scale—as he passed by me, I took no more notice of him than I did of any of the other prisoners, neither he of me; but on passing me on my right hand side, he took the pot up in his hand as if he had nothing in it, which is a very rare occurrence, and hit me a very severe blow on my forehead: it caused me to stagger, and I was caught by several other prisoners—after striking the blow, the prisoner ran down into the yard—I have not been able to return to my duty since—he inflicted the wound which you see on my forehead—I was obliged to go to bed—I was taken up into the infirmary; I had a very severe fit through it—it bled a great deal; the blood streamed down my arm—I had reported the prisoner on the previous day—I saw him talking, and I spoke to him; he owned to laughing, but he made a laugh of it, and the second time I told him of it he said he was doing me no harm; I said, "No, but you are breaking the rules of the prison"—I reported him, and he got two days' cell and bread and water from the governor—when the blow was struck, I had my cap on, and it was cut through; the leather is four times doubled, and it cut through that, and then inflicted the blow.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 5, Adam Street West. I was with the two last witnesses—I saw no scuffle—I heard Slark ask the prisoner what time it was; he made use of very bad language, and Jefferys and I walked on; in about a minute I heard Slark call out, "<hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>, he has got a knife, and has stabbed me in the arm"—I took my pocket handkerchief, and bound up the wound—I saw the prisoner fling a knife over an area, and showed the spot to a policeman—there was nothing offensive in the way Slark asked the prisoner the time.</p>

The prisoner has been in my employment over three years—it was his duty to make sales of goods, and receive moneys for them—when he received money it was his duty first of all to enter it in a book, and give me a copy of it at the end of every month—he was either to pay the money away to my order, or remit it to me—there was an understanding that until it came to about 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he might retain it in his hands, and when it came to that amount, he was to remit it to me through my bankers—that was to be done once a month—the average amount that he collected monthly was from 78<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to 93<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—somewhere about 20th Oct., after something had passed between us, he furnished me with this account (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is a statement of his deficiencies up to that date—this list does not contain the three sums of 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 9<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he has never accounted to me for those sums.</p>

                  </hi>. In Nov., 1856, I was manager to Messrs. Collins, ivory cutters, Charles Street, Hatton Garden; they deal in pianofortes. John Marks called upon me in that month—he said that he had sent a pianoforte, which he had bought of us, I think to Melbourne, and from the return sale of that he had an order for twelve to give me—I said twelve was a large number to order at once; but he said, from the account that he had had of the description of instrument that was wanted, he should not hesitate to</p>

               <p>have the twelve—he said they must be ready by a certain time—he named a time—I said it was impossible for us to get them by that time, the description of instrument that he wanted—I then showed him what we had in stock, and, being nearly the same description of instrument, only some were rosewood instead of walnut, he said that they would do—I said that I could not decide then on letting him have the twelve, until I spoke to Mr. James Collins—I saw him after that, and told him that Mr. James Collins objected to taking his acceptance for the whole amount of the twelve, but if he gave satisfactory references we would take his acceptance for half, and customers' bills for the remainder—the six were delivered to him—he gave the refer<lb/>ences, one was to a house in Houndsditch, and the other to his banker, Sir Claude Scott—the six were delivered on Nov. 27th, to a man that he sent in his own van—(<hi rend="italic">Molloy was here called in.</hi>—I think that is the person who came with the van, but I have no recollection of ever seeing him before or since—three were delivered the first time, I think—the van went twice with them—the other three were delivered the same day, I think—the invoice price of those six pianos was 234<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the cases were paid for—a bill was drawn for the amount, and John Marks, after the delivery of the goods, accepted that bill—it was not paid—it fell due Aug. 23rd, 1857.</p>

                  </hi>. I was in the service of John Marks, the bankrupt, from ten to twelve years before his bankruptcy, as foreman of his establish<lb/>ment, at Bell Street, Edgware Road—he had an establishment also in Long Acre, which he took about two years ago; I managed the business in Bell Street—I know Samuel Marks, his brother, and Abraham Simmons—the first time I saw Simmons was when Samuel Marks came from Melbourne—I saw Mr. Simmons in the prison, in Kingsgate Street; that was the first time I saw him—he was not carrying on any business at all—he lived at Rockingham Row, Kent Road—I cannot say what time that was; it may be two years ago, two and a half; or three years; Samuel Marks went away in 1853, and came back in about fifteen months afterwards—I went there to see Samuel Marks, and I saw Simmons with him—I know that Samuel Marks married Simmons's daughter—that might be about six or seven months</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185711230032"/>
               <p>after he got out of his trouble, out of Whitecross Street—Simmons and Samuel Marks carried on business in Long Acre as coach makers—their place of business was very nearly opposite to that of John Marks—at the latter end, I think, of last Nov., I was requested by John Marks to go to Mr. Collins's with a van for some pianos—I brought away six, by John Marks's directions, from Mr. Collins's; three each time, in John Marks's van, which he had had made by a man of the name of Lee—I took them to a mews in Great Queen Street, Long Acre—there was a coach house there, where they used to put carriages in—I have seen Simmons and Samuel Marks in that coach house; they helped me unload the last three that I brought there—when I took the pianos to this coach house, I saw a man of the name of <hi rend="italic">Bill.</hi> I do not know his other name, that used to work for Samuel Marks—Simmons and Samuel Marks were in the coach house while these pianos were there, and they told me I was to put them at the further end of the coach house, which I did—they remained there till I took the first load of varnish to the Eastern Counties Railway—that might be about three weeks or a fortnight after I brought them; but you will see by the Eastern Counties' Railway date, that was the day I took the first load of four pianos away by the directions of Simmons and Samuel Marks—John Marks told me that his brother Samuel wanted to see me, I went to him, and he told me he was going to get a van and horse of Mr. Bewer, a man who lets out horses and carts in Bedfordbury, and they were to go away—I took the pianos away after I had received those directions, in the van and horse—he did not tell me where to take them—he told me I was to drive over Waterloo Bridge, and Simmons and Samuel Marks would meet me over Waterloo Bridge—I started with the van and pianos, and went over Water<lb/>loo Bridge, and they met me just over the bridge, where the public house is, on the left hand side—they got up there, and instructed me to drive on—I had four pianos in the van—I turned to go along the Cornwall Road—they told me to turn round the turning, and keep on there until I got to Kent Street, in the Borough—they wanted me to stop back there, but I made some demur, and they had some conversation between each other, and I went on—they got out of the van—I turned up to Mr. Mandeville's back premises, where there is a public house at the corner—they got some man to help unload the pianos, and I stopped in the van and helped to get them out—that was the first time—I took two more pianos there by their directions, on the following Monday, and two crates of canvas—they were the pianos that had come from Messrs. Collins—it was on the Saturday that I took the four, and on the following Monday I took two, and some crates of canvas which had been bought by John Marks, of Mr. Unite, of St. Alban's Place, New Road—they did not go with me on the Monday; I was ordered to go down to St. Martin's Lane, by John Marks; he wanted to see me, and he ordered me to take them where I took the others—he asked me if I thought I could find the place out; I said, "Yes"—I saw Sim<lb/>mons also—he was up stairs, in Mr. Marks's room—he told me to be care<lb/>ful—I left those things there—I never saw Mandeville before—I never received any directions as to bringing those goods back—I had no more to do with them—I did not pack the canvas in the crates.</p>

Wilkinson and Kidd, the army saddlers, of Oxford Street—I first was told to take them to the Adelphi, and afterwards I was given instructions to go to the Lyceum Theatre—I commenced moving those things in May—John Marks and Samuel Marks, and Simmons, helped me load the first load—Samuel Marks sent his man up next morning with a horse, and I helped put the horse in the van, but I was not to say anything to his man, and of course I did not; I put the horse in, and I met him and Mr. Simmons—it was about 7 o'clock when I met them the first morning—Mr. Simmons was the first person to come, and Mr. Samuel Marks the next—Simmons came with a pair of morning slippers on, and he drove the horse and ran away, and Mr. Samuel Marks took me to a coffee shop, and kept me there some time—I did not know at that time where Simmons had driven the van with the goods to—from some suspicion I had, I employed two men, named Richard<lb/>son and Young, to watch where they drove the van to—I took about eight van loads of goods from the bankrupt's premises to the Lyceum Theatres—the value of the cases, as near to I can guess, was about 7, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never knew myself to what place in London the van with those goods was driven; I never saw the van, but I went with William Young, on Sunday, to Wool Quay, and there saw one of the packages with the direction turned over, directed to Ipswich—I there identified one of the cases that I had driven in the van from Bell Street; it had three pairs of wheels in it—I knew it again—in consequence of some information which was conveyed to me, I sent Young down to Ipswich; I did not go there myself—when I took the goods from Bell Street, Paddington, to drive them to the Lyceum Theatre, they were not directed, only numbered in rotation—I wrote on them out<lb/>side, in pencil mark, what the cases were; sometimes Mr. Samuel Marks used to come and put it down in a book, No. 1 contains such an article, and Mr. Lee used to come up stairs, and help me mark them, and plane the writing off—there was no address—I remember the bankruptcy of John Marks happening on 28th May—before the bankruptcy, John Marks told me I was to go and get shaved, and put on my coat, and go along with him; I did not put on my coat; I put on a jacket, and went with him—he told me I had no business to send the man Young down to Ipswich; I denied it to John Marks, but he took a <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> with me, and in the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> he questioned me about it, and I still denied it—he took me in the <hi rend="italic">cab.</hi> to Bernard Street; that is the residence of Samuel Marks; the first I saw there was Samuel Marks, then I afterwards saw Simmons, and we</p>

On Saturday, 13th Dec., I lent a horse to Samuel Marks, and on the Monday following I lent him a horse and van—my man did not go with it—it is a usual thing, but Mr. Marks never had my man—on 18th Aug. I let two horses to Samuel Marks—there was also a horse and cart let that day to him—no man went with it.</p>

Capper and Woolley, of Fenchurch Street, and instructed me to make arrangements with them for ninety-four cases of goods to Liverpool—I was directed to go down to Reading to see if the goods had been forwarded on to Liverpool—when I got there I did not find the goods, or get any information about them——I afterwards went to Liverpool, and saw on the jetty a number of cases, which I understood were the ninety-four cases I had gone about—they were marked with a diamond and C in the centre—a man was employed to take care of them until they were shipped for Australia—I did not employ him—they were shipped in the <hi rend="italic">Boanerges.</hi> for Sydney—I gave directions for them to be shipped—I have not heard of them since—I got the bills of lading and sent them to Samuel Marks—(<hi rend="italic">David Harris, managing clerk to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor at Ipswich. On Friday evening, 22nd May, I was consulted by Mr. Beckley and Mr. Brown, who were creditors of John Marks—I went with them to Mr. Paul's warehouse at Ipswich, and saw a large quantity of goods—in conse<lb/>quence of information a warrant was obtained by the superintendent at Ipswich, upon which Simmons and Samuel Marks were taken into custody—I saw sixty, seventy, or eighty cases of goods there; I forget the exact quantity; there was a large warehouse full of them—the prisoners were taken before a magistrate on the Saturday, and remanded till the Wednesday, when the case against them was withdrawn in consequence of an arrange<lb/>ment—I only knew Simmons by the name of Abraham Simmons at that time—on the Wednesday morning that the case was to have been heard, John Marks and his attorney, Mr. Solomons, called on me at my office—on the night the other prisoners were taken, or when they were remanded, Simmons stated, "The goods belong to John Marks, who is a respectable coach builder in the Acre; he bought them, and paid for them, and if he is</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185711230039"/>
               <p>telegraphed for, he will come down and satisfy you that they belong to him, and that we are innocent parties, and ought not to be here"—he also said, when before the Magistrate, that the goods were brought down to Ipswich for sale, to be turned into money at John Marks's request—on the Wed<lb/>nesday morning there was a declaration of insolvency, which was the act of Bankruptcy—I came up on the Wednesday night, and John Marks was made a bankrupt on the Thursday morning—at the time the declaration was signed, John Marks also made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, to enable us to take possession of the goods immediately—we then went before the Magistrate—I explained the matter to the creditors present, and stated, that as the goods were given up to them, and John Marks had signed a declaration of insolvency, we wished to withdraw the case, to which the Magistrate consented, and they were discharged—I then took the three prisoners into the adjoining room, the Grand Jury room, and Mr. Solomons and two or three other parties came with them—I said to Simmons and Samuel Marks, "I think you ought to know upon what terms you have been discharged"—I then told them that John Marks, to save them, as they were innocent parties (Marks had used those words), had made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors of all his effects, and had also made a declaration of insolvency—I was going on to put a question to them about some other goods, but Simmons or Samuel Marks interrupted me by saying that the van and two horses belonged to Simmons; they were not the bankrupt's—there was a van and two horses, and a well bred mare that Simmons had been riding about the country on—I did not observe what name was on the van—Samuel Marks said, "The van and two horses belong to me and Simmons, and the blood mare to Simmons"—I then said to them, "It is your duty to tell me if you know of any other goods which have been secreted, or in any way belong to John Marks. I have been told you have sent some other goods to Norwich; have you done so?"—Simmons said, "We have not sent any goods to Norwich or anywhere else, and we have no other goods but these"—Samuel Marks said, "Quite so; this is all we have;" and John Marks added, "They cannot have done so; this is the whole lot"—I came up to London that same evening, and the Commission was opened next morning—I saw Samuel Marks at the Bankruptcy Court, and I think I saw Simmons, I will not say actually in the Court room, but in the building.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Wilkinson and Stevens, solicitors, conducting this prosecution. I do not recollect exactly when the prisoners were given into custody; I think it was some time in Sept. last—Samuel Marks and Simmons have never attempted to prove a debt, they have made a claim—the cash deficiency in the bankrupt's account is 3, 924<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—that is the result of the accounts, which I have investigated carefully.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT BALLANTINE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">submitted, that by this indictment, founded on the.</hi> 251<hi rend="italic">st sect, of.</hi> 12 &amp; 13 <hi rend="italic">Vict., c.</hi> 106, <hi rend="italic">three distinct offences were charged; it was usual to have separate Counts for removal, concealment, and embezzle<lb/>ment; here they were all combined in one Count, and he submitted that the prosecution should be called upon to elect upon which charge it was intended to rely.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was of opinion, that before the prosecution could be called upon to elect, it must be shown that some inconvenience was suffered by the defendants; here no real difficulty could occur, it was not that two or three different charges were made, but different modes of stating the same thing, and it would be for the Jury to say whether the evidence brought the offence within either of those modes of charge.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">con<lb/>tended, on behalf of Samuel Marks, that there was no case for the Jury as against him; the evidence, if believed, clearly made out that he was a prin<lb/>cipal, and if so, he could not be convicted as an accessary before the fact; see Hales' Pleas of the Crown, p.</hi> 615, <hi rend="italic">and Reg. v. Pearce and others, Sess. Paper, Vol.</hi> 15, <hi rend="italic">page.</hi> 387; <hi rend="italic">he further contended, that no person but a bankrupt could commit the principal felony here charged, that the section in question applied only to a bankrupt, for in the.</hi> 209<hi rend="italic">th sect, the word "person" was used in con<lb/>tradistinction to the word "bankrupt," and, with that exception, the whole statute related merely to bankrupts and creditors, and contemplated no other class; and if any other person did such acts as in an ordinary felony would make him a principal, that would prevent his being liable as an accessary before the fact; further, that it was proved that the bankrupt had not passed his last examination, and the case of Rex v. Waller went to show, that until he had, he had a locus penitentize, and could not be indicted for a criminal offence.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. HUDDLESTON</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">for Simmons.</hi> relied upon the same objection; if the legislature had contem<lb/>plated any other person than a bankrupt being guilty of this offence, they would have stated so in express terms, and used the words "if any person," instead of, "any bankrupt;" in the case of concealing the birth, the words of the statute were, "if any woman shall conceal," etc., and there was an express section to enable a man to be convicted as an accessary to that offence; he also relied strongly upon the objection, that until the bankrupt had passed his last examina<lb/>tion, the felony was not complete within the meaning of the statute, and although the case of Rex v. Waller had been partially overruled by a case in the Exchequer, it was not overruled in such a way as to disentitle it to considera<lb/>tion. <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. EDWIN JAMES</hi>. <hi rend="italic">with respect to the first objection.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">that being the only one which the Court called upon him to answer., contended, that by</hi> 4<hi rend="italic">th Geo.</hi> 4, <hi rend="italic">an accessary before the fact might be indicted and convicted either before or after the conviction of the principal; therefore, accessaries to a sta<lb/>tutable felony might be convicted as principals; the.</hi> 11 &amp; 12 <hi rend="italic">Vict., c.</hi> 46, <hi rend="italic">sect.</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">regulated the pleadings; the indictment proceeded upon that statute; it alleged that the prisoners were accessaries before the fact, and therefore liable</hi>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185711230043"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">to be indicted as felons, and the statute enabled them to be indicted as acces<lb/>saries, charging them as principals in the first degree.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">was heard on the same side.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SERJEANT PARRY</hi>. <hi rend="italic">in reply, stated that what he con<lb/>tended was, that no person but a bankrupt could be a principal under this section, and that if another person, with a full knowledge of the bankrupt's fraudulent purpose, received goods from him and disposed of them, that person could not be an offender within the meaning of this statute; that the evidence here showed the parties to be principals, and that where a party became a prin<lb/>cipal in a felony, he could not be convicted as an accessary, because that acces<lb/>sorial act was rather an act of the mind than a physical act.</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. JUSTICE COLERIDGE</hi>. (<hi rend="italic">with</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185711230044"/>
               <p>afford to pay much"—he said it would be the first and last expense; 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was given him then, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the day following—she stated that she was the widow of Christopher Shepherd Parker, and her brother, Mr. Neagus, had drawn out of the bank 80, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of her property, and her sister, Susan Branch, 20, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her daughter Sarah to go to Australia, and previous to that, 15, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay her husband's debts, and that her husband's nephew, the Rev. Mr. Close, had come and taken out some, and all she had left was 180, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the Bank, the Roebuck tavern, and two houses in Dowgate Hill—the prisoner said, "In that case, you are a person of large property?"—she said, "Yes"—he said, "I can get it for you, and will do so imme<lb/>diately, but I must have money to serve writs on different parties"—he asked if there was a will—she said yes, but it was at Messrs. Seton and Nicholson's, in the Adelphi—she produced her husband's father's will—she said that she had had three children—he said, "Then the pro<lb/>perty has been willed to your children?"—she said they had all been poisoned—he appeared to make notes; he was constantly writing all that Mrs. Parker stated—she said, "Now you can proceed, of course"—he said, "No, I cannot without money"—she said, "How much?"—he said, "2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—this was not at the first interview, it was the second or third—the first time he came he stated his name to be Jervis, but he did not say where he resided—he said he had both a town and country house, and kept a carriage—he said, "I am a solicitor"—I think that was very nearly all that passed the first time—the second time he came for the remainder of the money—he said he was going to Merton or Morden, to search for the regis<lb/>ters of the deaths of those children—Mrs. Parker gave him the money, and he said he should go on the following day—during that second visit it was stated about the 80, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the 20, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I remember his coming in July; I do not remember on what day—he then wished to have more money, for the purpose of going down to Bury—Mrs. Parker said to him, "There are very few lawyers or solicitors of the name of Jervis; are you related to Sir John Jervis?"—he said, "Oh, yes, I am the son of Sir John Jervis"—she said, "Have you any brothers or sisters?"—he answered, "I have a sister"—she said, "Is she married or single?"—he said, "She is married to the Turkish ambassador"—Mrs. Parker said, "I thought you were some great man, you bear the stamp of it;" and, turning to me, she said, "Do you not think so, my dear?"—I said, "I must beg to differ in opinion with you"—I then turned to him, and said, "I have many times asked you for your address; you told me you had a town and country house, and kept a carriage; will you favour me with your card?"—he said, "Unfortunately, I came out without my card"—I said, "Then will you favour me with your country or town address, and I will put it down on paper"—he answered, "This is quite irrelevant to the point, and it is not customary to question solicitors"—he said he was a solicitor of forty years' standing—I asked him, if he kept a carriage, if he would occasionally give me a ride—he said he would be happy to do that—at that time he required 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., to go down to Bury—Mrs. Parker said, "I cannot give it you, I have but 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but I have no doubt my friend here" (pointing to myself) "will accommodate you with the other 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. "—he had 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and he left immediately on receiving it—he said that he had filed a bill in Chancery; that was before he received the money—he said the business was going on, and Mrs. Parker would receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the Saturday, which he would bring her, and that she would receive 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month till the case was concluded—I remember his coming again after that—that was in</p>

               <p>Oct.—at one time he received 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but I cannot tell the date—before he received that 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. he stated that he had been down to Bury, and he had seen Mrs. Parker's brother, and had served him with a writ, and that her brother must come up; he said it was highly necessary—he inquired the state of Mrs. Parker's mind when she was absent one morning; I cannot recollect the time—on several occasions he called when she was absent, but waited till her return—he received altogether upwards of 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> How soon did you first see me after 23rd May? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The advertisement was inserted on 27th May; you replied to it, and called immediately after—I wrote the advertisement, and Mrs. Parker herself inserted it—this paper (<hi rend="italic">Looking at one.</hi> is my writing—I had never seen you when I wrote this—when you called you gave your address, No. 62, Newman Street—you had written a letter, and given your address—that letter was received, I have no doubt, by Mrs. Parker—I mean to persist in saying that you came up stairs, and said, "Which of you ladies is Mrs. Parker?"—most decidedly you did so—you might have seen Mrs. Parker previously, and left your address; she saw many persons—when you first came, Mrs. Parker did not answer the door and begin to introduce you to me—I did not interrupt her by getting up and stating, "In short, Mr. Jervis, I am the wife of a solicitor, and I have written the advertisement, and I mean to act as her friend in the matter, as she has been greatly robbed"—you stated that you called to know whether she could make out anything, and what she could show you—she produced the probate of her husband's father's will—you looked at some of the other papers, and pre<lb/>mised to call on the following day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> On the following day, 1st June, did I call and read that probate over to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> All I can say is, that I got so weary of it that I went to sleep—the first time you had 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mrs. Parker, and 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the next—you said you would carry it through for the sum of 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—Mrs. Parker told you she had three children, most decidedly, and you asked me if it was true—you said, on reading the probate, "Then it will go to your husband's children," and she said, "Yes, I know that; I have had three children;" and you asked whether they were living, or, if dead, where they were buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she not give me instructions to go to search for their burials and baptisms at St. Martin's in the Fields, at Merton, and at Morden, and was not money given for that purpose? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Money was given—I believe you came the next day, and said you had searched Morden and Mitchan, and advised that Doctors' Commons should be searched, and you went with Mrs. Parker to Doctors' Commons—you were constantly coming for money, stating it was for this and for that—I believe you told Mrs. Parker that you could only interfere with one thing at a time, and you would only go at first under the will of her husband's father—my husband is not a solicitor, he is a law stationer—I cannot tell you where he resides; I do not reside with him—for the last three years I have resided with Mrs. Parker—I did not separate from my husband; there has never been any separation—he leaves me, and returns when he has what he calls his <hi rend="italic">spree.</hi>—I have not seen him for three years, but we parted very good friends—he does not maintain me now—I summoned him before a Magistrate, and the consequence was he was compelled to maintain me—Mrs. Parker said she had 180, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the funds, and that her brother had sold out 80, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and her sister had sold out 20, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for her daughter to go to Australia, and 15, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay her husband's debts—I never went out with you and Mrs.</p>

               <p>Parker, but down to the Roebuck—we met you at the station, and she said, "I have brought my sick friend with me; as she is ill, and it is so fine a day, I think a ride will do her good"—we went to Buckhurst Hill—I heard something of the people at the Roebuck directing you to Mr. Jury—I went to the Roebuck with Mrs. Parker when you were not there—I lodged with Mrs. Parker from 25th May till Oct.—I was invited on a visit—I paid her 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—you asked me one morning the state of Mrs. Parker's mind—I mentioned about a child by George IV., and four children by the Duke of Wellington. (<hi rend="italic">The deposition of the witness was here put in and read.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever receive a letter from the Duke of Wellington? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, when I was eighteen or nineteen years of age—you told me you were going to throw up the case, and when Mrs. Parker came in you said it was a good case—you said so most decidedly—I asked for your card; you told me your letters were to be addressed to Newman Street—you said you kept your carriage—you said that Sir John Jervis was your father, and your sister was married to the Turkish ambassador—you said both in answer to questions—I have not known you to wait two or three hours for an omni<lb/>bus—I know Mrs. Parker received the rent of her house in Sloane Street—she said you bore the stamp of being a great man—I have been with Mrs. Parker to the City—I told Mr. Ingram I could not state on oath when the 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. was paid till I referred to my friend, and I find you received it on 11th Aug.—the signatures at the bottom of these sheets of paper are my hand<lb/>writing—by direction of Mrs. Parker, I signed Sarah Parker at the bottom—I did not read it; you did—I do not know whether you left it two days to be read—it might be two weeks for what I know—in all probability it was—I suppose you read it yourself—Mrs. Parker said to me, "I approve of that; my dear, I will trouble you to sign it." (<hi rend="italic">This purported to be a state<lb/>ment by Mrs. Parker of property to which she was entitled, and particulars relating to her family.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You talk of the service of writs; was it not the service of notices? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> You called them writs—I signed many—I did not read them all—I glanced over several—I never saw Mrs. Parker pay you any money except at Manor Street—she did not pay you 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at Buckhurst Hill—most de<lb/>cidedly not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did she not come and put the two sovereigns on the table before me, and did you not see it, and tell me to take them up? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> At the Rein Deer that might have been, not at the Roebuck—she went to the Rein Deer to pay money, but what I do not know—I was there, she paid you some<lb/>thing, I cannot say what she paid you—you did not say before persons had a bill filed it was necessary to know what it was about, and she had better give the proper notice to know what it was, nor did I say it was perfectly correct—I signed some of the notices by Mrs. Parker's request—there were one or two which I did not approve of—you left some one night, and I kept them till the next day—I do not recollect receiving a letter by post on 11th Aug.

               <p>was fair, everything was right, that she would have 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, and 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. the next Saturday—I do not know whether you told Mrs. Parker that if she would make an affidavit that she was not worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the world, besides her wearing apparel, after the payment of her just debts, that the Court of Chancery would assign her a solicitor—I do not know whether you showed her a petition—this is my writing to this paper (<hi rend="italic">This was a petition of Mrs. Parker to the Court of Chancery, applying for permission to plead.</hi> in forma pauperis)—this paper might have been left with me two or three days before it was signed—I do not recollect—I have heard you say to Mrs. Parker, "My dear madam"—I recollect going with her to Newman Street, to see a piece of writing—you did not put her to any expense for refresh<lb/>ment; you refused to take any refreshment with her.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you in custody for being tipsy on 30th Aug? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> So it was stated—"I dined with Mrs. Parker that day—I really cannot recollect whether she prepared a shoulder of lamb for me, or whether I went out after dinner—I went out on that day, if it was 30th Aug.—I do not know whether I am bound to answer whether I got drunk, but I would say, "No"—I was taken up by the police, by Mrs. Parker's direction—I found myself in custody, and I said I knew not why I was there—I should say I was not in liquor—Mrs. Parker certainly came and got me out—I was not often tipsy when with her, not if she treated me—I was not often tipsy there, most decidedly not—I was not tipsy when I kept the papers all night—I was able to sign them, but I did not choose to sign them that night—I was not always more anxious to know about Mrs. Parker's business than she was herself—I did not always give the instructions; certainly not, only when she directed me—she keeps ardent spirits by her, and wine—she locks them up, and her tea and sugar, and other things—it was stated about her being mad before you produced a letter from her bro<lb/>ther, on 16th Aug.—I did not say I could prove to the contrary, and offer to leave the house and go to a neighbour, and fetch the doctor who was attending on her; most decidedly not—she and I had a quarrel, which gene<lb/>rally began in consequence of her referring to my husband—she used to market for herself, and she was under no restraint—I was her lodger, but she did everything as housekeeper—she kept house, and did as other people do—she did not talk as other people do—this letter (<hi rend="italic">looking at one.</hi> is my writing—I recollect your coming perfectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I tell Mrs. Parker that I had come in answer to your letter, to tell her I had not filed her bill at present, but I should want to see her pro<lb/>bate again first? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> What passed before I entered the parlour I cannot tell—when I entered, her niece came in immediately afterwards—I am not aware whether you asked Mrs. Parker for money—the first that was stated was, "They come to interrupt our business"—her niece said she had searched and found that you were no attorney, and there was no bill filed—you did not tell her there would be one filed—you distinctly told her the bill was filed—I am positive of it—the niece did not call her aunt a liar, and tell her she had had no children, nor did I get the doctor's bill and receipt to prove that she was not crazy—I did not say I was sorry that the niece had conducted herself in such a way, and say that I was afraid to go down into the kitchen to her—the niece said, "If I have insulted the gentleman, I beg his pardon;" and she laid a stress upon the <hi rend="italic">if.</hi>—you said you were an attorney, and you had a client very near, for whom you had done business for many years—you never said anything about having a clerk—I was not</p>

Mr. Oaks, of Bury St. Edmunds; I had been living with him some time—I left him in consequence of a letter received by that gentleman; I came to London—I saw the prisoner at my aunt's, Mrs. Sarah Parker's—she was residing then at Battersea—I went to my aunt's at 1 o'clock, and the prisoner came at 3 o'clock in the afternoon—I was present when he came—he asked my aunt who I was—she told him I was her nephew, and he went on telling me that he was the son of Sir John Jervis, that his father lived at No. 47, Eaton Square, that he had a town and country house, and his sister married the Turkish ambassador, that he kept his carriage, that he was an attorney, and that he could not only act in one Court, but in all the Courts, as a solicitor—he asked my aunt to fetch him the probate of her husband's father's will, and he began reading it—my aunt asked him why he had not come before—he said he had filed the bill in Chancery, and he had been taken up all day in selling the Man in the Moon public house—he said he had sold it for 12, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—when my aunt went up stairs to get the probate of the will, he said to me, "She is <hi rend="italic">cracky.</hi> all her relations say that she is; what do you think?"—I said, "She never has been right"—when my aunt brought down the probate, he read it all over, and told her she would come into possession of money, and he would bring her 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a week's time—she complained that that was very little, and he said in a few weeks after he should bring her 10, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—after he had been there some time, he said the bill was not filed, his time had been so taken up with the Lord Chancellor—he told me to stay with my aunt, and not to leave her, as she was coming into a great deal of money, and I was to have 8, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year and a title—he made an appointment to come at 6 o'clock on the following Tuesday, to bring the bills for me to read over to them, to let me see that he was about filing them—he said he had had a great deal of trouble.</p>

                  </hi>. I had an advertisement inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> for an attorney—I recollect your calling on me—I think I was alone—you told me you came about the advertisement—I told you I had several applications—you gave me your address—you had never seen Mrs. Houghton then—I directed her to write to you—I received a letter from you that you would come, and you did come—I took you up stairs, and introduced you to Mrs. Houghton—I do not know that you asked which of those ladies was Mrs. Parker—I think you knew me—I think Mrs. Houghton said she was a law stationer's widow—I am not aware that I produced my husband's father's will on that day—you promised to come on the following day and take copies—you read the will over to me and Mrs. Houghton, and you said the first thing to be done was to get up a case—you asked if I had any children—I told you I had three children, two born in Paris, and the two sons and a daughter, and I think they died suddenly within a few years—I believe you told me it was necessary to search for the certificate of their baptisms and their deaths—I cannot tell where they were buried—I think I gave you the name of a clergyman to go to at Morden—I might give you something on that day; I would not positively swear that I did—I do not know that I asked you for any card; I think Mrs. Houghton did—you never told me that you were the son of Sir John Jervis; I know his children quite well—I</p>

               <p>never heard that your sister was married to the Turkish ambassador before I heard it in the Court—I cannot tell whether you called on me, and told me that you could not find the certificates of the deaths of my children—I went with you to Doctors' Commons—I was taken very ill—we looked at several wills, and perhaps we referred to fourteen or fifteen others—I did not go with you to the Consistory Court—I do not recollect your telling me a day or two afterwards that you could find no wills of any of the parties—I think I paid 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the search—you never refused Mrs. Houghton to go into the city with me—I believe on 5th Aug. you sent me a statement of my case—I think Mrs. Houghton read some of it; it was too much—I believe I said I was satisfied with it—I thought you were going on right—very likely when that statement was put in, there had been 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. paid—I recollect going with you and Mrs. Houghton to Buckhurst Hill—I do not know what I said to you when I brought her to the station—she wished to go down—I recollect signing this paper on 11th Aug.—the second part of this statement relates to my late husband's property—that was begun as a separate charge against the parties—you said you should give the parties notice—I thought not—I do not recollect your telling me you had filed a bill in Chancery.</p>

Q.</hi> Did I not tell you that that statement should go before Counsel to prepare a bill, and that would go before the Lord Chancellor? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I never called you "My dear" in my life—I do not recollect that you ever called me "My dear"—I should have been rather surprised if you had—I never reproved you for being rude—when we went out together you never put me to any expense—you would not take anything yourself—I never accused Mrs. Houghton of having an illegitimate child by George the Fourth, and four by the Duke of Wellington—she must have been tipsy when she said so—I recollect the 30th Aug. very well—I had a leg of lamb and a greengage pie for dinner—Mrs. Houghton said she was going to receive the sacrament—when she came home she was tipsy, and she put her things on, and went out—she often got drunk—she did tell you that she thought I had a very good case, and that my relations had robbed me, but she does not know what she says—you charged me for omnibus hire—I never heard you say you kept your carriage—I recollect that on 11th Aug. I heard you brought one statement; I do not know that I saw it—I heard some of it—you told me you should want 50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the service of notices—I thought you always honest—I thought you were going on right—I did not give instructions for you to be taken into custody; certainly not—I think I have paid you 18<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in the whole—I do not recollect your saying that part of that was for writs—Mrs. Houghton paid me 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and I gave her her breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper—I have been several times to Newman Street—I never heard you say you had a country house—I believe you mentioned about a petition in Chancery for me to proceed <hi rend="italic">in forma pauperis</hi>—you said you could get me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month—you said that as soon as any money was paid in they would make me an allowance, and appoint an attorney and counsel—you read the petition to me—I believe you called on me on 29th Sept.—I really do not know whether Mrs. Houghton was present—my niece was there—I never heard you ask me to make any will—you said you were going to file a bill—I recollect my niece came into the room very quickly—she said you were an impostor, and came to extort money—you</p>

               <p>might say that you had not come for money, but you were money out of pocket—I believe she did say she had been to the Chancellor, and there was nothing done—I believe she begged your pardon—you might offer to show her her uncle's letter—I think you pulled your certificate out of your pocket—I do not know whether Mrs. Houghton said she could prove I was not insane—it is very likely I called at Newman Street about the end of Aug., and request you would come and see me, as I was alone—I did not accuse my niece of stealing two tons of coals—I missed some Brussels carpet out of my house, and she had the care of it—I recollect your coming to my house on 31st Oct.—my nephew chanced to come in—I did not know he was in London—you might tell him that I was going to file a bill <hi rend="italic">in forma pauperis</hi>—you had better have kept it to yourself—he told me that you told him that I should have 1, 000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in a week—you asked me for the probate, to examine it with the dates—I did not hear you tell him that you kept your carriage—I never heard you tell him you were the son of Sir John Jervis.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did I ever in my life get any money from you under the representa<lb/>tion that I was the son of Sir John Jervis and brother in law to the Turkish ambassador, and kept my carriage and country house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have repeat<lb/>edly told you "No"—I did not ask you why you did not come sooner after I had called at Newman Street—you did not ask me for any money that day—I do not recollect your bringing any affidavit—I believe you said you should return on the following Tuesday—I do not recollect that you opened the probate and began to read it—it was so sudden, about the person being ill in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, that I do not recollect anything more—I recollect your bringing the statement, and putting it into my nephew's hand, but he would not read it—you said you brought it for him to read to you and I—I asked you to tea, and you said you should like the lady to have a cup of tea, and you went out and came back, and partly fainted away; I gave you a glass of gin—I followed in the rear, and said I had nothing against you, and told them to leave you alone.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a brother of the last witness, and am a solicitor; I live at Cavendish Hotel, Golden Square. No. 68, Great Port<lb/>land Street, is the property of my mother—I went over it a fortnight or three weeks before 22nd Oct.—everything was then safe, as far as I could see—I received information on 22nd Oct., and went to the station house first—I was then accompanied to the house by two inspectors, and in the passage we found two of my sister's travelling trunks broken open, and the back parlour door was forced open—I then went up stairs to the drawing room, and found the doors locked; we conveyed the trunks to the station—there was nothing in them but bits of old dresses, nothing of any importance—I do not know what they had contained—this portmanteau (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is my sister's, but I had not seen it for some months—I afterwards got the keys of the drawing room, and went over the house with a policeman—we found every box and every safe broken open; both drawers, and desks, and wardrobes—some had the locks broken, and some were merely opened—at least 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth of property was stolen.</p>

On a Friday morning, about the 6th Nov., the day after Sankey arrived in London in custody, I was told that he wished to see me in his cell at Marylebone police station—I went to him, and he said, "Sergeant Potter, I believe you are engaged in this case?"—I said, "I am"—he said, "I wish to tell the truth"—I said, "What have you to say?"—he said, "I find I have been entirely deceived by a man of the name of White, and two men whom White introduced to me as his friends; and them first two men took me home drunk, and I fell asleep, and they robbed the house; after they had taken me home, they went out to get more drink, and I believe they let others in; when they awoke up in the morning, I found the house had been completely ransacked; the articles which were found on me were left in the dining room; and those things I put into the portmanteau and intended to take to the station, and report the case, but being afraid the case would be put on my shoulders, and being distracted in my mind, I took the woman, and went off with the things, instead of taking them to the station"—I did not take that down in writing—this was about an hour and a half or two hours before I went to the police court—last Thursday week, at a quarter before two o'clock, I went to Earl Street, Seven Dials, to the attic, with two officers—I knocked at the front room door, received no answer, and broke it open—we went in, and found Burnett and Mills in bed together—I said, "Have you got any jewellery or property here which does not belong to you?"—they both said they had none, and Mills jumped out of bed—I said, "Are you sure you have no watch or jewellery here—she said, "No; we have no watches and no jewellery"—I thought she took something quickly from a table that was standing by the bed—I said, "What have you there?"—she said, "Nothing but money" I said, "Let me look?" and took from her hand this red purse (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), containing seven sovereigns and some silver—I asked her whose it was—she said her's, and that she had had it for years—I said, "What have you in the other hand?"—she said, "Nothing"—I took hold of her hand, and found a lady's gold watch—I asked her whose it was—she said, "Mine"—I searched, and found two pillow cases, two or three towels, and some napkins—I left sergeant Pierce and Joy there, and searched the landlady's room, where I found a quantity of sheets—on the next day I made a further search in Burnett's room, and, on removing a cupboard which was standing on a shelf, I found twenty-six skeleton and latch keys, and large door keys of all descriptions; a centre bit, and two picklocks—I told them that I took them on a charge of robbery in Great Portland Street—Burnett said, "I do not know Sankey"—Sankey's name had not been mentioned then—I said, "Why do you mention Sankey; no one here has mentioned his name?"—he made no reply—Sankey was in custody at that time, and committed for trial—this was last Thursday week, and he was committed on the Friday—there had been a report, and the prisoner Sankey had given me the names of <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Harry</hi>—Burnett is the one whom he described as <hi rend="italic">Bill</hi>—I know White—he was taken into custody before Sankey was apprehended, and remanded—he has since absconded.</p>

I am a clerk in the principal money order office in London—this letter of advice arrived at our office on the morning of 31st Oct., and would authorise the payment of 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Mr. William Jolliffe Slade—on Monday morning, 2nd Nov., Mr. William Jolliffe Slade came to the office—in consequence of some representations which he then made, I filled up an application—this is the form of application issued when an order of this sort is missing—I filled that up, and then a duplicate order was issued, and the money paid; then the gentleman who drew out the order indorsed the original advice with the duplicate order "paid," so as to prevent its being paid a second time—that is the course of business—about half an hour after Mr. Slade had gone away, the prisoner Embleton came, between 11 and 12 o'clock, and produced this letter and this original order, of which I had had advice, just as it is now—from what I saw of that, and from the fact of my having paid the order before, I made a communication to the comptroller, and he was taken into the comptroller's room.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a police constable attached to the Post Office. My duty is principally in the money order department—on Monday, 2nd Nov., I was called into the office—I found Embleton at the granting window—I was desired by Mr. Spencer to take him round to the comptroller's office—I did so, and received this letter and order from Mr. Spencer—the Comptroller said to Embledon, "This is a forgery;" and he was asked where he got the order from—he said, "I received it from a person of the name of J. Slade, or commonly called <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Slade, on Saturday night, about 8 o'clock, and I was to receive half a crown for my trouble"—he said he was to take it back to Slade, at No. 13, Brydges Street, Covent Garden, that Slade lived there—I asked him what trade Mr. Slade was—he stated that he was a pen maker, and that he himself sold pens about—I asked him how long he had known him—he said he had known him a long time, he knew him when he lived at Chelsea; he then said, "I have been at the office before, with the order, and signed it 'J. Slade,' and it was refused in consequence of its wanting another Christian name;" he said, "I went back to Brydges Street, and from there to Broad Street, Bloomsbury, where I saw Slade; I told Slade I could not obtain the order, in consequence of its wanting another Christian name;" and he said, "'Why did you not tell me you had another Christian name, as I only knew you by the name of <hi rend="italic">Jem</hi> Slade?'"—I then took him to the Bow Street station, and left him there—as I was going out of the station, I said, "I suppose I shall have no difficulty in finding Mr. Slade at No. 13, Brydges Street?"—he</p>

               <p>said, "Not 13, 11; and if you do not find Slade there, ask for Bagley"—I went to No. 11; I found no such person as Slade; I then inquired for Bagley—I went up stairs into an upper room, and saw Bagley sitting there in his Post Office dress—I said, "Is your name Bagley?"—he said, "Yes"—I asked if he knew a person of the name of Slade—he said he had heard of the name—he said he had seen such a person—I asked if he knew where he lived—he said, "No"—I then said, "You sent a person of the name of Embleton to obtain a Post Office order for 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. "—he said, "Yes, I did"—I asked where he got that order from—he said, "I was on my delivery on Saturday morning, in Broad Street; a person tapped me on the shoulder, produced the order, and asked me where it was made payable; I looked at the order, and told him it was payable at the General Post Office; he asked me to get the order cashed for him, and he would give me half a crown; I said, 'I cannot go myself, but I will get a person to go for you;' he then gave me the order and the letter, first tearing off one half of it; he said the money was to be brought to him (Slade), at No. 56, Broad Street, St. Giles's, at 11 o'clock on Monday morning; he said it was the house next to the workhouse"—I found it to be a public house—he said that Embleton brought him the order back on the Monday, saying that he could not get payment for it—he said, "I then took and signed the order, as it is now produced, 'Wm. J. Slade,' and gave Embleton the order and letter back"—before I left the station Embleton said, "I took the order back to Slade, and told him that I could not receive the payment of it, in consequence of it wanting another Christian name, and Slade replied, 'Why did you not look at the letter?'" and he (Embleton) replied, "I was not going to look into other people's letters."</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 1, Market Street, Finsbury. I was in Mr. Oldham's employment at the same time as the prisoner; I am sure I do not know whether it was Mr. Oldham's or Mr. Leveridge's; Mr. Lever<lb/>idge employed me, at least he took me to the office; Mr. Oldham, when he came into the office, said, "I will not say anything; Mr. Leveridge will em<lb/>ploy you"—I was under the prisoner, he was chief clerk—on 7th Nov. he gave me a cheque for 96<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and a 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bank notes—I cannot speak to the 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. note; I had two that day, and I cannot say which he gave me, and which I had from the Commercial Bank; I wrote Mr. Leveridge's name upon it—I find it on this note—he told me to cash the cheque at the Com<lb/>mercial Bank, and then to get the notes changed at the Bank of England—it</p>

                  </hi>. I live at No. 2, Finsbury Market, and am a general dealer. On 13th Nov., about 12 o'clock at night, I was returning home with Mary Casey—when near Red Cross Street, I had occasion to leave her for a short time within two doors of Whitecross Street, and on my return I saw her and the prisoner—there was a lamp close by where she was stand<lb/>ing—she said the prisoner had indecently assaulted her—I asked him why he had done it—he made use of a most beastly expression, and I said, "I shall lock you up"—I directed Casey to go to the corner of Golden Lane, where I had seen a policeman a few minutes before, and tell him I wanted him—I said, "I will take care of the prisoner"—he said to me, "Do you mean to lock me up?"—I said, "Yes, I do"—he said, "If that is what you mean, fol<lb/>low me," and took to his heels—I followed him down Lower Whitecross Street, and into a court—the entrance of it is very narrow, but at the top is a square—I followed him there, and on the left hand there is a recess, and he fixed himself in it, and as I came by he <hi rend="italic">fetched</hi> me two violent blows on my face—they came so unexpectedly, that I was knocked down—I could see it was the prisoner—I jumped up and grappled him—I could have mastered him, I believe, but I found there were two more, who knocked me about most dread<lb/>fully, and kicked me about—I had a silver watch and a silver chain—I was knocked down three or four times, and the last time I was knocked down the prisoner seized my waistcoat, tore it open, and took my chain from round my neck, and the watch from my fob, while I was on the ground—I do not believe the prisoner kicked me, he struck me, and the others kicked me—I jumped on my feet, and made a last effort to get my watch—the prisoner had a muffler round his neck—I seized it, and he struck me again—I received three or four more blows, and fell with the muffler in my hand—it was all over soap suds, the same as my coat—there were soap suds in the gutter or drain—the prisoner dragged the muffler from me—I received some more kicks from the others, and they all left me—after I had recovered my<lb/>self a minute, I went to where I had left Mary Casey—I saw the officer, and he went back with me to the place—I saw where the soap suds had been mopped up from the ground with my things—I told the officer what kind of man the prisoner was—he took me to the yard where the prisoner was taken, and I went to the station in Moor Lane; I saw the prisoner there, and charged him—I am sure he is the man—this muffler was taken</p>

               <p>from his pocket, but it had been refolded; I told them to open it, and the mud and soap suds was on it—I told the officer to take off my coat and let the inspector smell it, and it had the same soap suds on it.</p>

I went to bed about 11 o'clock—my staircase window was one or two inches open—I have a yard in front of my house, in which were two or three ladders—between 3 and 4 o'clock on the following morning I was awoke by what appeared to be a single knock at the street door—I listened and heard a noise below—I got out of bed and opened my bed room door—the sash of the staircase window was thrown wide open—I waited about a minute, and saw a light come on the wall, which disappeared again—I went to the head of the stairs, and saw two men in the kitchen on the ground floor—I called out to them, and then there was a shuffling noise—I stepped back, expecting they would come up stairs, but instead of that they went out of the street door and out of the yard—I ran down, and ran across the yard—when I got into the yard, they had just got outside the gate—they ran down the street; and when I got to the gate they had come back, and were exactly opposite me, and one of them dashed something to the ground—I then ran after them up the street—when they got to the top of the street they divided—one ran one way, and one the other—I followed Jones down Silver Street and down Great Pulteney Street, where he was stopped by a policeman—I never lost sight of him—I went back to my house, and when I got back to where I had heard something thrown down, I saw a tobacco box found—it was not mine—I searched my premises—the key had been taken out of my parlour door, and a desk in the parlour had been broken open—I missed some postage and receipt stamps, and a pair of sugar tongs—two other boxes had been broken open, and a wooden door in front of my safe—I saw a candlestick picked up in the yard; that had been stolen also—a pair of steps was placed against the staircase window, which had been in the gateway the night before—a <hi rend="italic">jemmy</hi> was shown to me—I compared it with marks on the iron safe and other things, and they seemed to correspond.</p>

On 9th Nov., about half past 12 o'clock in the day, I was standing in Thames Street, and saw the prisoner's hand in my right pocket; he took my watch out, and passed it to some one else—Cotterell took hold of him, and he was taken to the station—I saw three persons who were near run away—I have not seen my watch since—I was mobbed, and had my hat knocked over my eyes.</p>

I said to the prosecutor, "Sir, this man has got your watch"—I saw the gentleman in the middle of the crowd being hustled, and I said, "Here is a man that has got a watch, if you have lost one"—I could not get a policeman for a moment or two, till the officer that I gave him in custody to came round, and then I said, "This man has just stolen a watch, it is in his pocket"—while I had the prisoner another man came and kicked me in the leg, and said, "What has this man done? he has done nothing; let him go"—I said, "I shall not let him go; he has got a watch"—he came and tried to rescue the man, and then he struck me on the hat, and my hat went off—this transpired before the policeman came up—the policeman took him into custody—I did not see the watch found on him—I held him by the collar all the time till the policeman came up.</p>

I was there when Brendall was brought in—I found a wound on his eye, at the lower edge, through the inverting mem<lb/>brane, showing a wound through the cornea into the interior chamber of the eye, which was filled with blood—the lens is injured, and he has lost the eye; it will not recover—it must have been a very violent blow with the knuckles, a chance blow; a man might try to do it a great many times before he could do it, as the eye is so beautifully protected.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, and live at No. 10, Upper Cleveland Street, Fitzroy Square. I have been a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man about six years—on Friday, Oct. 30th, about a quarter or half past 10 o'clock, I was on my rank in Tottenham Court Road, and a person of the name of Onslow, whom I had known for about nine months before, spoke to me there, and engaged my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—in consequence of that he came, with the prisoner Moore, at about 2 o'clock in the morning—my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was still on the rank—they got in, and Onslow said, "Drive up Goodge Street"—they pulled me up at Charlotte Place—Moore was in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at that time—when I got to Charlotte Street, a third party came, and they both got out—the third party appeared after they got out—I could scarcely see where they went, but they were back in half a second—they went in the direction of Charlotte Court—it was scarcely a second or two before they returned—Johnson was the third party, he was with them then—that was the first time I had seen him, to my knowledge—they brought two bags which they carried amongst them, I do not know scarcely which, they were all together; at all events they put them in my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, the three parties did; who put them in I cannot exactly say, and then Moore and Onslow got in—Johnson did not get in—I saw him again when I got to my residence—when Onslow and Moore got in, I asked where I was to drive to, and Onslow said, "Oh! go on;" I said, "Where to?"—he said, "Where you please;" I said, "I don't like that; have you got my fare?"—he said, no, he had not; he said, "Well, I must leave the things in the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>; I have no money to pay you; you know me, and if you take care of these things, we will fetch them in the morning, and pay you"—I had known Onslow as a man in the capacity of rubbing up <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>—I went to my own house with the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and the goods, and took the bags in them—I suppose it was about a quarter past 2 o'clock then, or something like that—after I had left the bags at my house, I went to take the horse and <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> home to the stables—I said to Moore and Onslow that I was going home; they said they were going my way, and they rode to the corner of the yard—when I had put up my <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> I came out, and saw a fellow servant of mine, named Sleigh, and I walked home with him—I got home, I should think, about 3 o'clock—Moore and Onslow followed me, and another one with them—I think that was Johnson; I could not be certain, because they followed on the other side of the way—they followed me right to my door—they did not speak to me there—I went in and went to bed, and I saw them no more till the next morning, when I saw Johnson and Moore about half past 6 o'clock—they walked into my place, and I was in bed; they undid one of those bags and counted out a quantity of shoes, I should think 100 pairs, and they invited my wife to have a pair of shoes, and likewise the children; they said</p>

               <p>there were plenty—of course it was refused—she said, "If you do not take those things away, I shall certainly fetch some one that will"—they both assured me that it was perfectly right, that there was no occasion to fear at all—they then went out—they had only stopped while they were counting the shoes, it might be ten minutes or a quarter of an hour—I was in bed while they were there—I got up after they were gone, and dressed myself—one of them, Moore, I think, brought another party in to look at the things—it appeared that they could not agree—nothing was said or done in my presence; they came into my kitchen, I was there—the third party looked over the shoes, and then they walked out together—they stopped there about a quarter of an hour doing that, and then Johnson came back directly, and took a pair of boots with him—Moore and Johnson were both in the kitchen when the third party was looking at the things—they left after that—I did not go to the police directly—Johnson came back the second time with some gin and beer—after that he went out again, and then I went down to Mr. Meller's, where I had picked these things up from—I saw Mr. Meller opening the shop, and saw him look aghast to see the things gone; I saw two inspectors, Pethers and Lambert, and I gave information to them of what had occurred, to Lambert, I think it was, and in conse<lb/>quence of that they came along with me.</p>

About half past 7 o'clock on the morning of 31st Oct. last I was outside the premises of Mr. Meller, in Charlotte Court, Goodge Street, and Smith made a communication to me—from what he said, I went to Cleveland Street, where I could command a view of his house—I went there about a quarter to 8 o'clock, and remained there till about a quarter past 10—it was nearly 8 o'clock when he spoke to me—I had examined the prosecutor's premises; I had been called to the matter—I saw Johnson admitted into No. 10, Upper Cleveland Street; that is Smith's house—he occupies the kitchen there—I followed him into the kitchen; and when there, told him I charged him with being concerned with others in stealing a quantity of boots from No. 16, Charlotte Street, Goodge Street, at the same time pointing to two sacks of boots that were lying on the floor of the kitchen—he replied, "There are others in it besides me; I only assisted in putting them in and out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>"—he did not say anything more—I took possession of the property—the bulk has been given to Mr. Meller—I took Johnson into custody, and remained in the premises till Moore came, and another man who has escaped—he was not Onslow, I have every reason to believe—I do not know Onslow, but the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man knew him well; he was there at the time, and he said it was not Onslow—when</p>

               <p>these two men came, they stamped at the railings outside the kitchen—I told the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man to admit them—he went up and admitted them, and directly he admitted them he ran away, leaving the two men to come down of their own accord—I told the constable, 68, Lambert, to follow the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man, and he took Moore into custody, and the other escaped—if we had had the assistance of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> man we should have captured them both—I did not hear either of the men say anything when they came.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> driver, and live at No. 9, Charles Street, Seymour Street, Euston Square. I am acquainted with Edward Smith—on the morning of 31st Oct. I saw him at the yard where the <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi> and horses stand—he was putting up, as I had previously done—there was one person in the yard about twenty yards from the gateway—I had some conversation with him—I went with him towards his house, to the corner of Warren Street, in Tottenham Court Road—I cannot say how far that is from his house—I did not know till this occurred where he lived—this was about a quarter past 3 o'clock in the morning—when I was walking with him towards his</p>

                  </hi>. I am a wine merchant, living at No. 15, London Street.

               <p>got into bad company, I would not allow him to go to business, and from that moment he was not entitled to receive anything from the prisoner—I did not tell him to allow my son 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a day, or 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week; since my son has not come to business I have paid him his money regularly—I am quite sure that the prisoner asked me for a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on 6th Nov.—he said, "Give me a cheque for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I want 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash"—I did not fill it up, being in a hurry, and for a long time I had a thorough confidence in the prisoner—I had a long indisposition, and did not come to town for twelve months, and I used to give him cheques, and he did not abuse that con<lb/>fidence—I have given him blank cheques when I was ill, and sometimes when I was in a great hurry, and a customer was waiting—I often filled them up myself, for my own expenses—I did not generally give him the business cheques in blank; he used to fill them up, and I used to sign them, for duties, or any large amount—I have given him blank cheques for petty cash, because sometimes he might have to pay 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on this occasion he asked me for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for petty cash, and I gave him the cheque, and told him to fill it up for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he was at my office all day on the 7th; I was not there myself—I understand that he made his appearance there on Monday, after business hours; we shut up at 4 o'clock—he came to my attorney's office on the Tuesday, because the police officer was on the look out for him—I believe I said to him, "Now, John, for God's sake, don't let this go forward; pay your debt, and have done with it"—he complained of my going, or sending, to his wife—I said if he did not hand over the money, I would give him into custody; he refused to do so—I did not say to him, after the policeman came, "I will give you a last chance; you shall come back to me, and nothing further shall he said if you will give up the money," nor anything to that effect—he made no claim for the amount that he had filled up the cheque for; there is his own handwriting in the petty cash book, to prove that he could have no claim—in Nov. last a person named Edwards made a claim against me for 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; it was an unjust claim, and I would not listen to it—I was required to pay 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. into Court, but I did not do it, and the bill was not allowed to pass.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of George Rich; we live at No. 15, King Street, Golden Square, in the parish of St. James, Westminster. On 23rd Oct. I went out with my husband, about 1 o'clock in the day—I locked the door of my first floor front room; I left nobody in it—I locked the room safely and took the key—I returned with my husband at a quarter before 3 o'clock—I did not notice anything on opening my room door, but as I was going to light a fire I saw a box open, and I found some things had been taken out of it—they were all safe when I went away—I lost seven gowns, two shawls, three mantles, nine waistcoats, and other articles, worth together about 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are only four of the gowns here; these are mine—these two shawls are mine; two mantles were mine; they were given up to me, and are at home—these other things are mine—these waistcoats have my husband's name and address on them; I identified one shawl when Watts had it on—Atkins has one of my scarves round his neck now.</p>

Q.</hi> Has this matter ever been inquired into before a Magistrate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—the prisoner was known to me in his capacity of beadle before he was appointed collector—if he had not conducted himself in a very exemplary manner he would not have been appointed collector—I believe this day book is the prisoner's son's writing—I should not say the prisoner is very illiterate; he cannot write very well—there is not another book besides those I have here which was used in the first instance when tolls were collected—I presume this one to be the toll book—the goods are carted by porters—the porters report to the prisoner the goods to each party, and he enters it in this book—I never heard of another book called the toll book in which such tolls are entered—here is a book called the rent book—these amounts are collected by the prisoner—he was to receive casual rents as well—these sundries mean sundry rents—a certain number are regular standers, week by week; he takes their tolls by name—other persons come casually; he does not know their names, and he puts "Sundries"—the sundries comprise the amount of tolls he receives from casual persons, not standholders—this name "Levy" is, I believe, a porter, who made a return to the prisoner—this entry, "Cases and rail," are cases which come by rail—the rents are entered in this part—we have no means of checking the prisoner with respect to the sundries—they might be double what he enters for what we know—the sundry tolls are very trifling—some are a halfpenny a basket—these amounts are made up of the small tolls—when this matter was first investigated it was before a committee—the prisoner attended as a matter of course, as beadle—he was not in custody.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When this matter was mentioned, did not the prisoner say, "Every shilling I received I always paid in"? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know that he said that, but he justified himself—I believe he said that he had accounted for all he had received—I think there were about three meetings that he attended before he was taken into custody—I forget whether it was in Sept. or the latter end of Aug. that he was taken, but he was not given into custody till some time afterwards—I gave intimation to the prisoner of these charges, when I knew what they were; I wrote him a letter—that was on Saturday—I did not tell Mr. Solomon before that notice that I should proceed with this indictment.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ROBINSON</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you a good opinion of the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I had no reason to suspect him till this was discovered, or a little time before—a committee was appointed to inquire—there were two or three charges entered into, and it was understood there would be others—I presume the sundries would be paid for at the time—Mr. Monk's was paid once a week—I</p>

               <p>cannot explain how it happened, that if a mistake was made by putting more into the sundries than he ought to have done, that a larger amount was put into his bills—I have looked at the bills which Mr. Monk has got; the amount of them is 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amount of the prisoner's accounts is about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

On Saturday, 24th Oct., the prisoner came to the bar about half past 11 o'clock at night—I served him with a pint of ale—he did not bring anything for it; but there was a pot on the counter, and he told me to fill it—the price was 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a half crown; I tried it on the counter, bent it a trifle, and said, "This is a bad one"—he said, "Is it?"—I gave it to my husband, who was on the other side of the counter—a constable was sent for, and the prisoner was taken into custody—after he was taken away, two hats were brought in by Maria Hull; I put them on the side of the counter—one was fetched away by the constable, the other remained till the Sunday morning.</p>

I can go quiet enough without you"—I let him go, and he immediately got away—we caught him again, and he immediately threw the constable—he threw him three times, and was very violent—I saw the two hats fall off in the scuffle, the policeman's and the prisoner's—I called to George Hull to pick them up and take them home, and he did—when I got to my home, I saw one hat there, and on Sunday morning I gave that hat to George Lewis, to take to the constable—I had taken a bad half crown ten days or a fortnight before—I had thrown that away by the Elephant and Castle.</p>

               <p>in Leather Lane. On 10th Nov., about 10 o'clock in the morning, I was in Wooding Street, Lambeth; I saw the two prisoners there—I went, playing my organ, down a court where there is a house where they some<lb/>times give me a penny—I went down, and the shop was shut up—the two prisoners followed me, and Lee caught hold of me round the waist, and tried to get my pocket—I thought he was in joke—I had in my pocket a half crown, a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, a sixpence, and 2 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—Burns was in the court at that time—when Lee caught hold of me and caught hold of my pocket, I went into the middle of the court, and then both the prisoners caught me—one caught hold of my shoulder, and the other round my waist; they threw me down, and both got on me—they took my money away—Lee put his hand in my pocket first—I cannot swear which had my money—they only left one farthing in my pocket—they kicked me, and went away—I told a policeman.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a shoemaker, of Eagle Street. On the morning of 10th Nov. I saw the prosecutor with his organ in Little Windmill Street about 11 o'clock—shortly afterwards I saw the two prisoners following him; he went down Jane Place, they offered him a halfpenny to go down, and they followed him—I followed behind; as soon as they got down, one got on one side of the prosecutor and the other on the other—he was coming back, and Burns jumped on his back; he could hardly stand—then Burns got off, and Lee caught him round the waist and threw him down—while he was on the ground, the prisoners were on the top of him—I saw Lee put his hand in his right hand waistcoat pocket, and he shook something up in his hand which sounded like silver—the prosecutor cried out, "Stop thief!" and tried to get hold of their legs, and they both gave him several kicks while he was on the ground—Lee afterwards opened his hand, and I saw a half crown and a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece in it—the prosecutor got up and said something which I could not understand, and the prisoners both said, "If you don't go we will smash you"—I can swear the prisoners are the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Did they both say, "If you don't go, we will smash you?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, they said it together—one part of Jane Court is in Wood<lb/>ing Street—I was about two yards from Lee when he opened his hand—I can swear it was not two half crowns he had—I can swear I saw a 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. piece, it looked so bright—he did not show it to me; he showed it to the other prisoner—I do not believe they saw me—only bad girls live in that court; there was no one going down it—the prisoners went on towards Wooding Street—I left them, came out with the prosecutor to the policeman, and the two prisoners were in the other end of the court—there is a public house there, the White Horse—I heard some persons say that they had turned out of there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Burns.</hi> This witness says that we offered the prosecutor a halfpenny; the prosecutor did not say that. <hi rend="italic">Witness.</hi> You said that you would give him a halfpenny, and you shook your pocket, and said it was the last half-penny that you had got.</p>

               <p>prosecutor came to me, and complained of being robbed of 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and being ill used in Jane Place—I went with him, he pointed the prisoners out, and I took them—I found 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on Burns—I told them what I wanted them for—they both said they knew nothing about it, in a <hi rend="italic">staggering</hi> sort of manner—they were both a little in liquor.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> What time was this? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About a quarter before 11 o'clock—I did not see Andrews till he came to the station—he did not point out the prisoners—they both appeared as if they had been up all night—since then I have made a little inquiry; I find Lee is a respectable working man—he gave a true statement of where he lived.</p>
