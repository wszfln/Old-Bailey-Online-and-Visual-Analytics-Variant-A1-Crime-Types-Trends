            The PREFACE.</p>
            <p>As the Welfare of every People depends in great Measure upon the good Tendency of the Actions of every particular Member; so the Detriment thereof arises from a contrary Conduct, and Behaviour of Men. Hence every Piece of Injustice, or Injury done to another, occasions a kind of Resentment in the Breast of every honest Man, and true Christian. Because, as he doubtless wills and wishes every Good to himself, and uses his best Endeavours to prevent, that any Mischief or Harm should be done him; so is be concerned for his Neighbour, that his Property in any Shape may not be ravished from him. And this Inclination is be affected with, not only out of that Respect be chooses to pay to that Golden Rule, as it is called, of willing, and doing to others, as he would they should do by himself; but because the Commands of his God are frequent to this Purpose in several Parts of his revealed Will.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, a Set of Men there are, as is too much experimentally found, who bound by no Obligations or Law of either Divine or Human Institution, led by no Promises to Virtue, and scared by no Threats from Vice, seem averse to all that is Good. These give a Loose to their own licentious Will, and suffer no Restraint in their evil Courses; they boggle at no Degree of Wickedness. Besides, as 'tis said, they train up, and as it were educate, and teach others a Sort of Emulation, who shall be forwardest in the Practice of every evil Work. A sad and melancholy Thought indeed, that there are such sad Instances for the Rigour, and Severity of Justice, and the Laws to be so frequently executed upon; a Calamity scarce sufficiently to be lamented, that so many Men should study, as it were, how to render themselves not only useless Members of Society, but obnoxious to all that Ignominy, Shame, and Disgrace, which are justly due to their atrocious Offences.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding the man fest Vigilance, and Care of the Worthy Magistrates, and Guardians of this great and famous Metropolis, to put a Stop, if possible, to the Growth of those Evils, and to bring Men to a proper Sense of the Laws of the Land, by which the whole, and every Part of the Community is to be protected in their Lives, their Rights, their Liberties, and their Properties; yet, we find, there are, who, deaf to all Invitations to Duty, untouch'd by any Examples of the Vengeance of the Laws, not only disturb the Peace and Order of this City; but by their daily Transgressions, by Robberies, Murders, and the like, seem to aim at breaking asunder the Ligaments of all Society. These Wickednesses, together with the blasphemous Impieties of the Age, are such, and so growing every Day, as to cry aloud for</p>

            <p>
            The PREFACE.</p>
            <p>a proportionable Distribution of Punishments for their Crimes. The Guilty cannot but allow, that their own ill Management and Behaviour in Life brings the deserved Fate of their Iniquities on their own Head, the necessary Consequence of their Wickedness on their own Pate. And those, to whom the Knowledge of Actions being punished according to their Malignity shall by any Means be conveyed, cannot but be pleased to see, or hear, how Justice is dealt forth with an equal and impartial Hand. And now,</p>
            <p>As I am about to enter on an Office, or Duty, which may in some Measure be said to be New to me, it seems to be expected I should declare what my Proceedings shall hereafter be with Respect to the unhappy Persons, in that melancholy Situation I shall from Time to Time meet with them. And the Reason for such Expectation may be, not only as 'tis customary, but, as I have before observed, because the Public is partly concerned for the good or evil Tendency of every private Man's Actions, and to provide that Rewardsand Punishments be proportioned to Actions.</p>
            <p>In few Words then be it known, that my Attendance shall be constantly and daily, pursuant to the Order of my Worthy Patrons the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen; to whom I beg Leave to take this Opportunity of returning my hearty and sincere Acknowledgments of their Favour, and of assuring them, that the unhappy Prisoners shall from Time to Time be instructed in their Duty publickly and privately, according to the best of my Power. To which may God more and more enable me!</p>
            <p>Whatever they shall think fit to acquaint me with in Respect to their Life and Conversation, shall faithfully and ingenuously be dealt forth in almost their own Words, as Occasion offers; sometimes indeed begging Allowance for a better Dress, than the Ideas and Thoughts of some of them, who may be altogether illiterate and ignorant, can be supposed by them to be expressed, when delivered to me.</p>
            <p>This, I hope, is sufficient for the present. May God continue to me his Grace, and Strength, to pursue my present Undertaking, to help forward the Salvation of such Wretches, as most need Help. And, the Sincerity of my Intentions may be a Reason, why the Public might receive with Candour and Good-Nature the present Sheets, and others that may hereafter come before them from my Hands.</p>

For a Series of Years he frequented the Playhouse Passages, and scarce a Night passed but he carried home with him a considerable Booty: So industrious was he in his Business, that he neglected no Game, high or low; for he would aspire to a Lady's Gold Watch or a Gentleman's Sword, or descend so low as a single Handkerchief. In these Adventures he sometimes met with Opposition, but always retained a Number of Dependants, whose Care and Business it was to keep a good Look-out, and if at any Time he came into a Scrape, a Posse was immediately raised, and he was sure to be rescued. At length he became so considerable among them, that he kept a Warehouse on purpose to receive such Goods as from Time to Time those Gentry pick'd up, and a fix'd Price was made for every Sort of Commodity, which they were always sure to receive on Sight; a Gold Watch was fix'd at Five Guineas, a Silver Watch at a Guinea and an half, and so in Proportion for any Sort of Commodity they laid their Hands on; and when a sufficient Cargo was made up, he generally took a Trip to <placeName id="OA17470617-geo-11">

            <p>At every publick Entertainment, or Shew of any Sort, he was always present; either an Installation, a Clergy's Sons Feast, or any such publick Meeting; he was sure to make one, and sure too to make it worth his while, as the News-Papers soon after testified in the Rewards offered for Watches, &amp;c. lost at those Places, of which he or his Agents generally had a good Share.</p>
            <p>In Length of Time his Face began to be pretty well known, and he obliged to appear somewhat more reserved, especially as there happened unluckily for him a Quarrel between one of his Out-Scouts; whom he had cheated out of a Gold Repeating Watch he had stolen from Lady H -. This Chap, whose Name was W -, was so much vexed at losing what he had ventured his Life for, that he was determined at all Events to Squeak, as they call it; which made Sir John, as he knew it was in his Power to hang him, to think of providing for himself; and therefore, as by his going to and from <placeName id="OA17470617-geo-13">

            <p>After his Return from Cruizing, hearing that his Companion W - had been transported, he began again to follow his old Trade, and frequented the Passage leading out of Spring-Garden into the Park; was there generally on Sunday Evening, then being the greatest Concourse of People: His Method was commonly to go with three or four in Company; two of 'em was to be coming out of the Park a-breast, while the others were entering in; and just at that narrow Passage, when a sufficient Number of People were gathered together, who found it impossible by their Obstruction to get backward or forward, Sir John set to work, and whatever he got he immediately handed to his Wife, who generally followed close to him, and she handed to her Maid; so that it was three deep in an Instant, that if it had been miss'd by the Loser, he would of Course have fixed on the Person most near to him, which has been frequently Sir John's Case, when nothing being found upon him, and he genteely dress'd, the Person whose Pocket he had but that Instant pick'd, has been obliged to ask his Pardon. In such Cases the Maid's Instructions were immediately to get off with what she had received; but it no Suspicion happen'd, to stay till her Master went, and then to follow. He has frequently gotten three or four Watches of an Evening in this Manner, till at length he was taken on the Information of his Maid, and capitally convicted.</p>
            <p>His Wife also since his Confinement was taken up for robbing a Shoemaker's Shop of a Parcel of Shoes, tried at the Old Bailey, and sentenced for Transportation, which Sentence has been since put in Execution, and she gone abroad.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174706170008"/>
            <p>
            While Sir John was under Sentence of Death, he set his Engines to work, and by the Help of his Money procured some People to contrive a most iniquitous Scheme to save his Life, which was as follows:</p>
            <p>The Maid who swore against him having a Quarrel with another Person, was sued by an Attorney; which being told Sir John, he quickly imagined that Quarrel might be of Use to him, and sending for his Friends, they contrived together, and drew up a strong Affidavit, setting forth, that all which the Maid had sworn at the Old Bailey against him was absolutely false, wicked and malicious, and done with an Intent to take away the Life of her Master out of Malice and Revenge, and that she could not be easy till she had in this Manner discharged her Conscience, by doing all in her Power to express her Sorrow and Repentance for so vile an Act.</p>
            <p>This Affidavit being drawn, the next Business was how to get the Maid to swear it: They immediately went to the Person with whom she had the Quarrel, and getting her on their Side, persuaded her to make her Proposals of Peace, which she readily came into, and agreed that General Releases should be drawn; which being done, and read to her, she was content; but being quite ignorant in these Affairs, was told, she was to swear it before a Magistrate, which the Maid, supposing a proper Form, consented to, and accordingly went before one. In the mean time, they had artfully taken away the General Release, and put in its Place the above Affidavit, which they were in Hopes she would have sworn; but when it came to be read to her, she absolutely refused it. On which Disappointment they knew not what to do; but getting another Woman, for a large Sum of Money, who was pretty near like the Maid, they again went to the Magistrate, whom they deceived, he taking her for the real Person who had been before him but a little Time past, and the Affidavit was sworn and signed.</p>
            <p>Having now gotten over this difficult Task, the next Thought was how and in what Manner to use this Instrument of Wickedness; but that Way was soon pointed out. Hearing when his Majesty was to receive the Recorder's Report of the Malefactors under Sentence of Death, they got a Petition drawn up, in strong Terms, setting forth the Innocency of Mr. Pidgeon, to which this Affidavit was annexed, and both Petition and Affidavit they procured to be laid before his Majesty in Council; which being read, Mr. Pidgeon was pitied, and his Majesty was pleased to respite him, and he had the Satisfaction to see the other Criminals go to be hang'd, while he remained behind.</p>
            <p>But he enjoy'd not long the Success of his Art and Contrivance: This iniquitous Scheme was soon brought to light; for the above Maid being on some Occasion again at the Old Bailey as an Evidence, was questioned about this Affidavit, which she utterly denied, and being then on her Oath declared, that what she had sworn in that Court against Mr. Pidgeon was absolutely the Truth, and nothing but the Truth;</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174706170009"/>
            <p>which so much surprized the whole Court, that the Magistrate before whom the Affidavit was sworn was immediately sent for; and after some little Enquiry, the whole Affair was unravelled, and proper Report thereof being made to his Majesty, he was justly and deservedly included in the next Dead-Warrant, and suffered accordingly.</p>
            <p>All these Affairs to be sure drained Sir John's Pocket, it having cost him during his Confinement upwards of Twelve Hundred Pounds; nevertheless, 'tis said, that his Companions have publickly declared that they would give a Thousand Pounds still to save him.</p>

She appeared of a surly obstinate Disposition, and was resolved to give no Account of herself, she said, because she would have no Speeches made about her when she was dead. She said also it was Grief enough to her Parents that she suffered such an ignominious Death, and she did not choose to say any thing to be repeated after her Death to add to their Afflictions for her unhappy End. It were Pity, indeed, she had not been always of that Way of thinking, then she had not been an Instance of the Resentment of the Laws, and the Cause of the Parents Grief had been taken out of the Way. She confesses the Facts for which she suffers; says she was sorry to have been so long, as till the Warrant came down for her Execution, fed with vain Hopes of a Pardon. She dies however, she says, in Charity with all Men, and hopes for Salvation through the Merits of Christ.</p>

There were several other Indictments found against her from different Shop-keepers she had robbed; but being capitally convicted on one, the Court thought it needless to try her on any other: Nevertheless, when Sentence came to be pronounced upon her, and she was asked what she had to say, she made a Speech, which lasted some Time, in which she seemed to arraign the Justice of the Court, in not giving her Time or Opportunity to make her proper Defence, by sending for Witnesses, &amp;c. But being told she had allthe Indulgence the Law in such Cases requires, she submitted. The Truth indeed was she knew herself guilty, but foolishly imagined the Punishment of her Crimes did not amount higher than Transportation, and therefore did not take so much Pains in her Defence as she would have done, had she thought her Life was in Danger; however, she at length owned the Justice of her Sentence, and died in Peace.</p>
            <p>She seemed to be of a turbulent Spirit, and frequently quarrelled with her Fellow-Prisoners, and being the weaker Vessel, frequently came off damaged. When she was tried she had two black Eyes, which she got in a Quarrel; and when she went to the Place of Execution, she had a black Eye, received but a few Days before in another Skirmish. During her Confinement she contracted a great Fondness for Gentleman Harry, which lasted to the Gallows; for they went off the Stage, after saluting each other several Times, Hand in Hand, with her Head reclining on his Breast.</p>

He had no Manner of Education given him, and being brought up to no Business, lived with them till within these two Years past. In which Time, he says, he was used to be up and down the Streets, idling away his Time, which is too frequently the Forerunner of evil Courses. He owns the Fact for which he dies, and says he has been a very wicked and profligate Boy; has been guilty of breaking the Sabbath, and many other Offences against God and his Neighbour. He was very ignorant, but very willing to be instructed in Religion, and the Duties thereof; and was very desirous of partaking of the Sacrament, which I had from Time to Time given him as much Insight into the Nature of it as I thought convenient, and as the Church of England directs. He declares himself sincerely sorry for the Sins and Offences of his Life; not only (as I gave him to understand his Sorrow ought to be grounded) because they had brought him to his unhappy End, but because they were committed against a good and gracious God. He was always very penitent, and depends for Salvation in the World to come on the alone Merits of Christ Jesus, our Redeemer.</p>

He told me the Circumstances of this Affair, and endeavoured to palliate the Offence, by saying, she used provoking Words to him; which he being in some Measure concern'd in Liquor, as he call'd it, soon rais'd his Passion, and hurried him on to that cruel Act, otherwise he believes he had not been so wicked.

            <p>Fustian Frock, White Stockings, and White Drawers; and just as he got into the Cart at Newgate, threw off his Shoes. Being arrived at the Place of Execution, some Time was spent in Devotion, in which they all most heartily joined.</p>
            <p>PIDGEON wept bitterly, and denied to the last his committing the two Robberies on which he was convicted; but owned he had in other Respects been a wicked Sinner, and justly deserved to die.</p>
            <p>SIMMS happening to see in the Crowd the Person who was taken into Custody on his Information concerning a Plot to assassinate the King, he most heartily ask'd his Pardon; and declared at the same time, that the whole was a Scheme form'd in his own Brain, in hopes to save his Life. The Person told him he forgave him with all his Heart; he then addressing himself to the People again owned the Robbery of Mr. Smith in the Borough.</p>
            <p>ALLEN Wept a good deal, and own'd the Robbery for which she died.</p>
            <p>EXELBY and HUDSON both own'd the Justice of their Sentence.</p>
