            <p>After their Condemnation, they were urged in the most serious Manner to prepare themselves for their approaching Dissolution; and as they were all Persons</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174008060003"/>
            <p>utterly ignorant of Religion, and absolute Strangers to Piety and Virtue, the Wretchedness of their State, and the Importance of the great Work they had to perform, was set before them in Terms most likely to affect them. Their dreadful Condition was represented to them, as they had forsaken the only Fountain of Happiness, and were Strangers to the Covenant of Promise, having no Hope, as they had liv'd entirely without God in the World.</p>
            <p>I endeavoured to make them sensible of this their wretched and miserable State; and to consider, that as they had all their Lives neglected their Souls, and their future everlasting Good, it was highly necessary that they should redouble their Care and Diligence in improving the short Space of Time that was before them, to saving Ends and Purposes. And as the Image of God was destroyed in them, and they had liv'd all their Days in Enmity to God and Goodness, they were instructed to cry mightily to God, to be filled with a due Sense of the Evil of their past Courses, and that clean Hearts, and upright Spirits, might be renewed in them.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17400806n18-2" type="given" value="JOHN"/>John Foster</persName>, having been convicted of Murder, they had Admonitions suitable to their Cases. The Heinousness of their Crimes were represented to them, and they were made sensible, that their having destroy'd the Lives of their Fellow-Creatures, was an Offence for which no adequate Reparation was possible to be made by them. That it was a bold, presumptuous invading the Power and Authority of the Lord of Life, and the Author of all our Beings, whose Property alone it is to give Life, or to stop the Breath in our Nostrils. That God had expressed against such Offenders his highest Indignation, having declared, That the Bloody and Deceitful shall not live out half his Days; that whosoever sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed; and that God himself will require it at the Hands of such Sinners against him, and their Fellow-Creatures.</p>
            <p>It was further represented to them, that the Consequences of Murder were horrible and bitter, with regard to themselves even in this World; for though they should have escaped the Justice of Men, yet unless their Consciences were seared, and they under a judicial Hardness of Heart, they could never have expected to be free from that Anguish and Horror of Mind, which would have inseparably haunted them through all the Hours of their after Lives, and would likewise have dreadfully Embittered all their future Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>After these Things were laid before them, and they seemingly affected with them, they were in the most serious Manner advised in this their Distress to fly for Refuge to the Hope set before us, to plead for Mercy at the Throne of Grace through the Blood of Jesus, which speaketh better Things than that of Abel, and to pray for that sincere Contrition and Repentance which God would not despise.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174008060004"/>
            <p>During the Time of their Confinement in the Cells, they willingly attended at the Chapel, and to outward Appearance joined with me in Prayer; but yet none of them were so seriously and deeply affected with a Sense of their deplorable and undone Condition, as they ought to have been, and as would have become Reasonable Creatures, under such Melancholly Circumstances.</p>

He endeavour'd to extenuate his Crime, by charging the Deceased with being likewise addicted to Liquor, and by saying, she did not apply in Time to a Surgeon for Assistance, and that when the Church-Wardens got her into the Hospital, it was too late.

Tho' his Drunkenness was rather an aggravation, than an Excuse of his Crime, yet this was what he insisted on, in allevation of it. He behaved with seeming Seriousness, and declared that he repented of all his Sins, and died in Peace with all Men.</p>

            <p>About a Twelvemonth ago she was brought to Bed of a Child, and this Child she overlaid one Night in her Liquor, while I was abroad getting what I could, so that can't be laid to my Charge. When I came Home, I found what had happened, and some Words rising between us, as she was in Liquor, I left her and went to another Lodging-House till she was sober. She had then on a Parish Gown, and when I returned to her, I told her, - Sukey, there's no body that ever belonged to me ever wore a Parish Gown; so I went out and asked Charity, and with what I got I bought her another Gown, and got the other made into a Petticoat for her. Then I went out again to get a Penny to buy us a little Victuals, and some Flowers to put into the Child's Coffin; and having got Three-pence Three Farthings, I came Home to her, and we spent it together.</p>

Our Time, who are to suffer, is appointed by our Fellow-Creatures, but yours is likewise appointed, though not by Man, for there is an appointed Time when all must die, and Man's Life is very short, 'tis like a Shadow that flies away. My Fellow-Prisoner Clark, is something of a Scholar, and a Man that has Knowledge; I had rather discourse with such a one, than with one that knows nothing, for talking to an ignorant Person, is only sowing good Seed among Tares, according to the Parable; but Clark the Catcher being a Man of some Learning, I bid him turn to the Parable, where the Master of the Vineyard sends Workmen into the Vineyard, and they that were last hired, received as much as they who had Wrought longer. I told that Parable was for the Encouragement of Sinners; and John, says I, this is suitable to your Case and mine. He read it over, and shaking his Head said, it was very extraordinary. After  a Taylor, who was at Work in the Press-Yard, hearing me talk Scripture so, thought me a Scholar, and asked me Who was the first Taylor? Why, says</p>

He could not answer me, so I asked him what he thought of Joseph, who took the Lands of the AEgyptians in Pledge for Corn in the Time of Famine; and so I silenc'd him.</p>
            <p>And now, tho' I have the Gift of Knowledge, I have no Expectation but to die; but what signifies Life, 'tis but a Vapour and a Trouble, and we all must die sooner or later. I hope no one will reflect upon my Son for my dying in so shameful a Manner, and that is my last Request.</p>

This provok'd me, and I threaten'd to push her down Stairs, upon which she took hold of the Broom, and I took it from her, and happened to give her a Blow on the Right Side of the Top of her Head, and though the Witness swore I afterwards turn'd the Broom and struck her over the Shoulder, yet there was no Marks on her Shoulder, and to be sure a Man in a Passion would strike as fast as he could without turning the Broom; but this unlucky Blow prov'd her Death; and I expected nothing less than to suffer for it, as soon as I heard she was dead.

I serv'd him five Years, and used to ply with him on the Water. While I was with him, and lay waiting for Pares at the Steel-Yard, Three Cranes, and other landing Places, I generally diverted myself with a Catcher and Ball, and by constant Fractice, I arrived to such Perfection in the Management of it, that I could whenever I pleased catch the Ball, either on the Point, or in the Cup, ninety-nine Times out of a Hundred.</p>
            <p>By this Means I used to pick up sometimes 2 or 3 Shillings a Day, by Betting and Wagering among the Watermen, and at Alehouses near our plying Places. This occasion'd me frequently to neglect my Master's Business, and tho' he was angry with me at first, yet when he found I was willing to appease him, with Part of what I won, he was much easier under my Negligence.</p>
            <p>After some little Time, I thought it hard my Master should constantly come in for a Share of what I got by my Art, so upon Consideration what was to be done, I resolved to leave him; and accordingly the hard Work of a Waterman not being agreeable to me, I ran away from my Service, and got me a Wife, who drew Beer at an Alehouse at Lambeth.</p>
            <p>I supported her and my self for some Time with my Catcher and Ball, by playing in <placeName id="OA17400806-geo-63">

            <p>The next Day we went over the Water, and as we were going along the Road, we overtook a Cart, which had been at London with Greens and Fruit; I made an Agreement with the Gardiner to ride to such a Place, when I got there (Parker and my Companions having gone a shorter Way) were waiting for me, and as soon as I alighted, Parker pick'd up a Catcher, which I offer'd to buy of him; according to Custom we agreed, and he said he would spend the Money. While this was doing we all fell to play with the Catcher, and I took in the Countryman for a good Parcel of his Money, while my Companions assisted in the Design, by taking the Countryman's Part, and urging him to venture good round Wagers with me.</p>

            <p>Others were Artists at dropping Money and shuffling the Cards; I was taken into this Society as an Artist with my Catcher, and hoped that some one or other of our Partners would be always at Work, and that I should not want Money now.</p>

Izzard found it, and I being pretty near him, cry'd out - Halves, and told him I would give him six Pence for his Share.

            <p>All my Life Time I have been a most wicked Wretch, neglecting all Religion, breaking the Sabbath, drinking to Excess, and herding with bad Company. I always delighted in Gaming and idleness, and have travelled to most of the Country Towns and Fairs in England, with my Companions and my Catcher, and have frequently got 30 or 40 s. a Day, and sometimes 40 or 50 l. in a Week; but as I got it in an ill Method, it never did me any real good, for as fast as I got it in this idle manner, I always squandered it away as foolishly and extravagantly, in my wicked Way of Life.</p>
            <p>It was very unhappy for me to be left destitute of Friends, and to be abandon'd by my Parents in my Infancy, if there had been a due Care taken of me in my Youth, and had my Father not deserted me, but trained me up in a regular, orderly Way, and restrained me from vicious Company, my untimely Fate might have been prevented, and I should not have come to this shameful and ignominious End.</p>
            <p>But being destitute of Friends, and having no one to prevent my being exposed in my tender Years to the wide World, and to the Vices with which it abounds, and having been carelesly brought up in a total Neglect of all Religion, and Duty both to God and Man, my early Days was full of Crimes, and as I advanc'd in Years, I made a proportionable Progress in every Vice; and being an absolute Stranger to the Obligations of Piety and Vertue, I never was under any checks of Conscience for the Commission of my enormous Crimes.</p>
            <p>I now deplore my Misfortune and my Folly too late; and for the Sake of rash unadvised young Persons, whose ill Courses may involve them in the same dreadful Circumstances, into which I am now plunged, I declare that my Life has been a continual Scene of Trouble and Uneasiness, and tho' I have not laboured much under the Remorse of my Conscience, yet I have been in constant and continual Fear, even from the Successes of my Way of Life, and this not without Reason; for the consequence of my Gain has been, that several Times I have been committed to Houses of Correction, from whence I have with Difficulty got my Release; happy would it have been for me, if the Trouble I frequently met with, had warned me from my ill Courses; but instead of that, I always returned with more Eagerness to my old Vices, and my Ignorance even of the first Principles of Religion, rend'red me capable of committing any Crime, if I had but a Shadow of Reason to believe I</p>

            <p>should escape without the Punishment of the Law. How thankful ought every one to be for careful Parents, and a pious Education, the Want of which has occasioned me to live the Life of a Brute, in Ignorance, Rapine, and Plunder, without one Hour of Satisfaction in all I have enjoy'd, and the Consequences of which are Misery here, and a dreadful Prospect of Anguish and Torment hereafter.</p>

            <p>Aug. 4, 1740.</p>
            <p>Dear G -.</p>
            <p>" AS my unhappy Courses have " brought me to the End of " my Days, which, though I am " but a Young Man, must be cut " short by the Hand of Publick " Justice: I thought I could not " do you any greater Kindness, than " to send you Word, that with " my expiring Breath I desire you " would look on me as a miserable Example of that Calamity which " will most certainly overtake you, " and the rest of our Companions, " if you do not turn from those " Courses, which we all inconsiderately have been engaged in so " long. Consider that all our Pleasures have been too dearly bought, " at the Expence of our Peace and " a good Conscience, and the Consequence has been Terror, Fear, " and a constant Apprehension of " that Hand of Justice which has overtaken me. View in me the " Period of all our Engagements, and " as you would avoid those Terrors " with which I am now fill'd, and " which will most assuredly torture " your Mind upon the near Approach " of that shameful Death which will " certainly overtake you, if you persist in our ill Courses; as you would " avoid all these, fly from the Company of wicked Men, and abandon " your Way of Life. What would " I give, that I could be able to look " back upon my past Time without " Torment of Soul; it would afford " me more comfort and satisfaction, "than all the World can now give " me. That you may take Warning " by my dreadful Fate, and immediately shun those Paths which " have brought me to Destruction, is " the hearty Wish of,</p>
            <p>Your Friend,</p>
