As to the Fact for which he was convicted, he said he neither did, nor thought of any Harm, tho' he had a Pistol in his Hand charged with a large Slug, and about 20 Shot which he held right against the Persons who went down into the Cellar to take him; that Horner broke open the Cellar Window, and went down; and not coming up after he had called to him several Times, he went himself down to fetch him up. I leave it to the Reader, whether a Man could mean any Harm, who had the above Pistol, and a Bottle with Gunpowder; besides a Sword or Tuck, and a Piece of Iron, an Instrument made use of to splice Ropes with, with which 'tis very probable the Door was wrench'd open. Thus accoutered, and found in a Cellar, broke open, his Intentions could not be very harmless; and nothing to be sure, but being seasonably detected prevented his carrying his evil Designs in Execution. He was armed for doing great Mischief, and seem'd to have a Will fit for such Enterprizes.</p>

For Davis got into Business and continued to work, and do Jobs for one or other Home to the Time he was taken. He knew Raffody was guilty of wicked Practices, and advised him, often against it, but unluckily for him Raffody came to his Lodgings the Afternoon the Fact was committed, and they having drank together more, he says, than he was accustomed to do, they went out to take a Walk, Davis not thinking of any Harm; he was pretty much in Liquor, he says, and as they went along, Raffody took the Advantage of it, and began to talk to him about Thieving, said there was a good deal to be got that Way, and he had a good Mind to try his Luck that Way. Davis says, he did not give much heed to what he said at that Time; they talk'd again of indifferent Matters, but Raffody would not drop this Subject, and said to Davis, you foolish Dog what signifies your slaving every Day for a Trifle, when if you'll be ruled by me, you shall live easy and well, without hard Labour. Davis says, he replied, that he loved Work better than Play, and if any one was of a contrary Opinion, they might follow their own Inclination; 'twas nothing to him, and he hoped to get his Livelihood by his Work; tho' by Means of evil Communication he finds himself mistaken.</p>
            <p>They kept together that Day and Evening, and drank at several Places in their Walk, so that Davis says, he was pretty much in Liquor, and his evil Counsellor prevailed; being off his Guard, he forgot his former Use of going to his Lodgings in very good Time, so they kept walking the Streets till they met with Mr. Fleming. As he came towards them, come says Raffody to Davis, we'll set upon this Fellow and rob him, we two shall be a Match for him. Accordingly Raffody attacks Mr. Fleming, and tho' Davis had passed him (being somewhat diffident of what he was going about) he returned to the Assistance of his now Brother in Iniquity. He owns the taking of the Watch and Shoe Buckles, but says if there was any Money in the Case, it must have been taken by the other, for he does not remember to have seen or handled any at that Time. No sooner had they committed the Robbery, but a Gentleman coming by that Instant, and saying, what are you at that Sport? then have at you.

But he says, he is heartily sorry for what he has done, tho' this is the first Time he ever even thought to commit a Robbery, and it was not five Minutes before 'twas done.

When the Constable apprehended her, she asked him, What it was for? He only told her in Reply, It was Time enough for her to know when he had taken her before a Justice. She was in the City Liberties when taken, but the Prosecutor, and the other Witness, by the Constable's Advice, agreed to take her to a Justice of Peace quite out of the Liberties of both where the Fact was supposed to be done, and she apprehended. She lamented her Fate, and said, she never had any other Thoughts than of getting an honest Livelihood by her Calling; and therefore to be brought to an untimely End was so much the more unexpected and terrible to her.

He says he has been in the Service for some Years, but how, and where, he either could not tell himself, or would not; and the rest of his Life is all a Secret, 'till for some evil Practice he was put into Custody of a Watchman, whom he robbed, and treated very ill, at the same Time he robbed the Prosecutor. There was indeed another Indictment against him for that Fact, but the other appearing so plain, it was thought needless to try him upon it. However, he denies the Fact for which he was convicted, though so plainly proved against him; nay, the very Character the Persons he called into his Aid and Defence gave him, added Circumstances from whence his Guilt might be inferred, tho' they alone are seldom sufficient to produce a Conviction in the Place where he had his Trial. About six Weeks before this Fact he was in Custody, as above, two Days and a Night, for knocking a Man down upon the King's Highway, and for that Offence was liable to Indictment; but the Person then by him injured, frighted with the Menaces of his Accomplices, in case he prosecuted McLaughlin, was at last glad to consent to his being let go. This might have been a Warning to him, if he had any Sense of the Evil of his Ways; but nothing less than Justice overtaking him, could have stopt his Course, his Genius seeming somehow or other suited to the Purposes of Rapine and Plunder.</p>
            <p>Barbarity and Cruelty appeared to be rooted in his Breast, as far as he was concerned in committing this Fact, and there can be no Manner of Doubt of his Guilt; for on the 29th of March last, McLaughlin, and three Persons his Comrades, were, like the Devil, lying in wait to see whom they might destroy; and the Prosecutor, with the Watchman, lighting him Home, happened to fall into their Clutches. They were all three concerned in robbing them, but it does not appear that any but McLaughlin treated them ill. They robbed the Prosecutor of the Things mentioned in the Indictment, and afterwards took away his Hat and Wig; but by his Entreaties they at last relented, and gave him them back again: But McLaughlin knocked down and robbed the poor Watchman, and used him barbarously, by jumping upon his Breast; upon which the poor Man only said, Why do you use me so barbarously? I did not use you so when I had you in my Custody two Days and a Night; and they began to threaten and swear at him in a most shocking Manner, bidding him deliver; and they took from him one Shilling and Four-pence, and his Hat and Wig.</p>

            <p>This Affair was next Day noised Abroad in the Neighbourhood, and that McLaughlin was one concerned in it. A Constable, whose Business called him there, went to the Three Mackerels, and seeing him there, knew him, and took him. The Constable saying to him, You are the Man that abused the Watchman, he seemed to speak of it with Pleasure, and replied, The Watchman was very much abused, and I did it; repeating again, in an exulting Manner, I am the Man that did it: (I suppose in Revenge that the poor Watchman had done his Duty, and kept him in his Custodylonger than he approved of. The Constable having taken him sent for a Watchman, who being come, said directly upon Sight of him, this is the Man that abused me, and stamp'd upon my Breast, accordingly they had him before a Justice, who committed him to <placeName id="OA17490426-geo-47">
