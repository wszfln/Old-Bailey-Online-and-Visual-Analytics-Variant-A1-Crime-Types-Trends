            <p>Immediately after conviction, they were severally put into a cell as usual; a place contrived by the architect, no doubt with a view, first to safe-keeping, and then to a speedy execution; for they can scarce breathe, much less exercise in the compass of six or seven feet square, having neither air nor light but what is strained through a thick-barred iron grate, fixed in an aperture scarce so large as a port-hole, and yet so high above the head of the prisoner that it cannot admit light enough to read by, at the brightest noon-day, however needful and proper that exercise must be to those who can,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176308240003"/>
            <p>and are disposed to read in these their last hours. These dreadful tombs for the living are equally distressing in extreme heat or cold; and as to candle-light, their only resource, they can have no money of their own property to purchase that or any other necessary, being known to forfeit all, if perchance any be left, from the wretched rapacity of a prison, on their convicton. In these ill-favoured circumstances did this unhappy set of criminals languish and pine, several of them very near to death, for 6 or 7 weeks, from the beginning of July to the 24th of August; in a season when (it need not be said) air and light are most necessary for them, and most wanted to preserve life and prevent infection. A sad scene to which my attendance on this place has been less accustomed during the late war, wherein we have had few or no convictions at this season, most infectious to the prisoners and perilous to those who attend them.</p>
            <p>If this representation from a daily eyewitness, which humanity can no more suppress, than true benevolence can forbear to relieve, should contribute to deter any rash and unwary adventurers now safe and at liberty, from blindly rushing into such circumstances as may render them liable to this dark and dreadful passage out of this life, into a worse, that will be one good purpose attained.</p>
            <p>Whatever farther good designs may be quickened into life and motion from these, and yet higher considerations, by the powerful, the wise, and the good, of our honourable city and county; it may better become us, humbly to hope and wish, than to mention on this occasion. Only adding, that the cells are the best part of our present gaol: and that the four respited convicts have escaped more deaths than one: and 'tis hoped from the same mercy which has hitherto saved them, that if they be true penitents, and make a right use of what is past, they have undergone the worst of their sufferings.</p>

The prosecutor, a Portugueze in the same service, was paid off with him from on board the Blenheim. They had been shipmates therein about 2 months. Mackely received two guineas wages, and had but one left when he committed this fact. From the time of his conviction, though he appeared tolerably composed and resigned, he was deplorably wretched in his circumstances, being distempered and indigent both of clothes and food, and destitute of friends to help him; so that if he with most of his fellow-convicts had not been daily fed, by several well-disposed neighbours, particularly some of each of the nearest markets, and others who were applied to on this occasion, they might probably have been famished.</p>
            <p>He daily attended our chapel, behaved with seeming decency, and when questioned, said, he understood the plain instructions there given, and joined in the prayers. It was his own option to do this: yet he was often claimed by those of the church of Rome; but after several attempts, he refused to be directed by them. A few days before he suffered he was twice visited by a clergyman of his own communion, to which he was admitted by him, and which appeared to confirm him in his peace of mind and submission to his lot. He was not however, sometime before this so peaceful and resigned as he now appeared to be, for he was detected to be deeply concerned in a conspiracy to break out by a very wicked and ungrateful attempt on those very runners and keepers who, had been kind and compassionate to him in his distress. He with a few more of these convicts, abusing the delay and forbearance of their execution to relapse into their former bad habits and evil thoughts, instead of improving it to their better preparation for eternity, had formed this weak but wicked scheme, after they found themselves included in the death-warrant. But it only made fresh work for a repentance yet less hopeful; made my attendance on them yet heavier and more disagreeable, calling for just and necessary reproofs, when consolation should have taken place, in the chapel, and occasioning them who were actively concerned to be chained down in their cells. Yet he still continued to join in prayer with us; and after repeated instruction, preparation, and examination, was finally admitted to the holy communion.</p>

When they found all their endeavours were in vain, their grief at parting is not to be described: he lamented especially that he had not followed the good example of his wife, in keeping to his church and being a frequent communicant, nor regarded the good instruction and advice she used to read to him out of pious books. This they both mentioned as matter of grief to him, and credit to her, that she had laboured to keep him to his duty. He has left one son of 2 years old.

His behaviour since his conviction is said to have been quiet, submissive, and becoming his circumstances. Hopes were entertained and communicated to him of having his life spared, for this crime, on account of some services he had done in the prison; which would not, probably, have been disappointed, but for the unsurmountable objection of his having been tried, though acquitted, last session, for being concerned with two others in the robbery of a young woman near <placeName id="OA17630824-geo-40">

And though he confessed, when in custody of the constable, that the pieces of money found upon him were Mrs. White's, the prosecutor's, prperty, found by him in a shoe in her cellar, and most of it was recovered, yet, another part of his behaviour greatly aggravated this felony; when being asked by Mrs. Dobey, partner to Mrs. White, are not you a great rogue to rob her that has been better than a mother to you? he replied, with a bitter curse against her, and said, what is that to you; and when ordered by the justice to deliver up</p>

            <p>the silver buckles bought with her money, he said, no, blast me, I will not: this shews his heart was obstinately set on coveting and keeping that which he had unjustly gotten, and too probably shut that door of favour and mercy against him, which otherwise would very likely been opened to him: for indeed this unhappy offender seems to have been drawn into this fact rather by surprize, and the temptation falling in his way, than by ill design; he fell rather for want of virtue and resolution to resist, than through an active premeditated evil purpose. It seems he has dealt with Mrs. White, the prosecutor's wife, for small tubs, called salmon-kits, for 13 years past: it is part of his employment to turn them into small washing-tubs. Having bought a number of these, he was entrusted to go down to a cellar and take them away; being almost blind, he groped them out as well as he could, in doing of which, this sum of money, amounting to 35l. nearly, fell in his way, and was by him seized as good prize, but it proved his bane.</p>
            <p>On the first sight of him, at chapel, after conviction, his case not being known to me, he was asked what he was convicted for? he answered, for a thing which a thousand others would have done as well as he. He was told, a thousand others might do wrong, and suffer for it. He daily frequented the chapel, and had the advantage of hearing and attention superior to those who saw better, and were more liable to be amused by various objects: but he rarely spoke, or made any responses, acknowledging he was little accustomed to the church-service, but had sometimes gone to the Tabernacle. He seemed to enjoy health better than most other of the convicts, was peaceful and resigned, and answered whenever he was asked, that he employed his time in repentance and prayer, and preparation for death, to the best of his ability.

This is the account he gave of his manner of living, till he fell into this fatal snare: from whence it is plain he might have been comfortably supported, and usefully employed many years, had he lived in the fear of God, a dependance on his providence, and obedience to his laws. He fell a warning to all, not to quit the path of honest industry for the gilded bait of unlawful gain, nor give way to a sudden temptation, however alluring and seemingly convenient for the present, since the consequences will be bitter as gall and wormwood.</p>

For all which, both he and Murphy earnestly prayed for pardon of God, and the injured parties. They all oined in prayers and receiving the holy-communion, with some good neighbours, who were present.

They got to the fatal place in about an hour. It took near half an hour to disengage them from the cart, and tie them up to the tree. After which they were asked, Whether they had hope in God's mercy through Christ? whether they were resigned? and in peace? to which they gave satisfactory answers; and their behaviour seemed to confirm it. They agreed to desire the multitude, which was very large, to join in prayer with and for them; which they did with decency. They themselves prayed earnestly; Murphy making responses audibly for himself, and the rest who could not read.</p>
            <p>They were severally asked, Whether they had any thing farther to say, either publicly by way of warning, or in private by way of acknowledgement? Holloway answered, he had nothing farther to say but what he said to his friend; he meant one habited like a chairman, who had been in close conversation with him in the cart, before prayers.</p>
            <p>Murphy only repeated it, that he was not guilty of the fact for which he suffered; and that she was a common woman who swore falsly against him. He had said also in the chapel, after the death-warrant came, " God forgive her that swore my life away falsely!" Mackely and Saunders had nothing to say.</p>
            <p>While these four joined with us in prayer, Geary was invited to do the same, but refused, and kept reading and praying in his own book, with his face toward us. He was told, we would con</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176308240012"/>
            <p>tinue to pray for him to the last, as we had hitherto done.</p>
            <p>A little before prayers were ended, some loud cracking of the timber in the nearest galleries was heard, which alarmed and terrified the numerous crouds that were on and near them, occasioned the latter to retreat, and several of the former to swing themselves down at the peril of their bones: it caused a short interruption in prayer, the sufferers turning their heads about to observe many who seemed to be as near death as themselves. Having gone through the proper and usual acts of devotion, and confession of faith, and given the final benediction, we parted. They continued to pray devoutly after their caps were put on, and drawn over their faces, and when the cart was moving from under them, they cried aloud in prayer, beseeching the Lord Jesus to receive their spirits. Many present were much affected, even to tears; all seemed serious, with a mixture of some complacence to see these poor destitute sinners make an hopeful exit, which seemed to promise a deliverance out of all their sufferings.</p>
            <p>P. S. It has been reported that the poor breathless corps of Saunders was inhumanly abused by a giddy multitude, to the purposes of a lawless riot, and misapplied revenge, so directly contrary to the temper in which he closed his life; for beside that he died in charity with all, I never heard that he once reflected on his prosecutors, or murmured at his lot; and I am persuaded, could he, at that instant, have opened his mouth, he would have spoken to this purpose, " Beware rash men! ye call &#8221; yourselves christians, now is the time &#8220; to prove your title! judge not, that ye &#8220; be not judged. Dearly beloved, avenge &#8220; not yourselves, nor me, in your mistaken rage and fury; but hear a voice &#8220; more tremendous than the loudest &#8220; peals of thunder. - It is written, vengance is mine, saith the LORD, and I &#8220; will repay - the wrong-doer.&#8221;</p>
            <p>&#8220; May the Almighty Prince of peace, &#8220; who stilleth the waves, who ruleth the &#8220; raging of the sea, and the madness of &#8220; the people, stablish and strengthen our &#8220; most gracious and amiable Sovereign, &#8220; with every rank and order of men, &#8220; throughout his wide dominions, in &#8220; peace and piety, in duty and safety, at &#8220; home and abroad."</p>
