            <p>It is true, he is descended by the Father's Side from a very honourable Family in the Highlands of Scotland, whose particular Distinction it would be cruel to mention on this scandalous Occasion. His Father, a younger Son of this Family, was bred up a Divine of the Church of Scotland, and going over to <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-5">

He married into a reputable Family in these Parts and left only two Sons; one of them an Honour to his Memory, and Profession, he bred up a Divine, and is now Pastor of a Protestant Congregation at the Hague. The other the unhappy Sufferer, whose behaviour has afforded so much Matter of Speculation to the World. To him he gave a decent Education, designing him for some mercantile Employment, so soon as he should be of Age proper to be put into a <rs id="OA17501003-occupation-8" type="occupation">Compting-House</rs>

            <p>Mr. Maclean's Patrimony gone before he was much turned of 20, his Mother's Friends who were the only Relations he had in Ireland, quarrelled with him for his Extravagance, and refused him either Advice, Shelter or Subsistence, his Brother was then in Holland, and he was too far removed, and too little acquainted with any of his Family in Scotland, to acquaint them with his Wants, or receive any Assistance from them.</p>
            <p>After various Attempts to prevail on his Mother's Relations to fit him cut for the Sea, or some other Business that might insure his future Subsistence, proving unsuccessful, he had no other Recourse lest, but for Bread, to become menial <rs id="OA17501003-occupation-9" type="occupation">Servant</rs>

            <p>But either they saw something in his Manner and Principles that did not promise them much Credit from their Kinsman, or his Demands were ill-timed and unsuitable to their Circumstances, for they refused either to see him, or afford him any Countenance.</p>
            <p>On this Disappointment he gave over all Thoughts of any of his Relations, except his Brother at the Hague, from whom he frequently received Remittances and Advice that might have been of greater Service to him than all the Money on Earth, but the Cash was to him much more acceptable, he spent it as fast as he could, and never remembred the prudent Council that accompanied it longer than he was reading the Letter: However, it could not be expected that the Appointments of a Dutch Minister could spare Support for an idle Gentleman. These Favours frequent, and larger than could be expected, every Thing considered, were not sufficient to depend on for Subsistence, and Mr. Maclean was obliged once more to look out for some Gentleman's Service, where he might be free from the Dread of meer Want of the Necessaries of Life.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175010030005"/>
            <p>As he had left Mr. Howard's Service without a Character, it was more difficult for him now to get a Place without it, than if he had never been in Service before, as the Want of it laid him under a kind of Suspicion,which all his Pretensions to Gentility could not wipe off.</p>
            <p>He was some Months before he got over this Difficulty; but at last Providence, always indulgent to Designs that have Industry and Honesty for their Motive, cast him accidentally into Company with a good-natur'd Officer of the Army, who had some Knowledge of his Father's Family, and was perfectly acquainted with that honest Man's real Worth and Character, and on that Account ventured to recommend him to Col. R - d F - n, of D - n - le near <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-8">

            <p>He remained some Time out of Place, and had some Thoughts of going over to serve in the Irish Brigade in the French Service, but on communicating his Design to a Gentleman who had the Charge of enlisting Men for that Service, he was told, that his Encouragement there would be but small, unless he would conform to the Popish Religion; and though his After conduct shewed that he was very little influenced by the Doctrines and Principles of any Religion, yet the early Tincture he had received from the pious Care of his Parents of the Protestant Faith, supported him under the Temptation of embracing the Errors of the Church of Rome, though prompted by a View of Interest, and the most pressing present Wants; he rejected the Proposal, and gave over all Thoughts of the Irish Brigade.</p>
            <p>Fortune seem'd to reward his Constancy, for about this Time he came to understand, that his old Master, Col. T - n, intended shortly to set out for England. Mr. Maclean entertained some Hopes, that if he could find Means to come into England, he might there find a better Chance for some Sort of Living than where he was. Presuming on the Colonel's known Humanity, he represented to him, in as pathetick Terms as he could devise, the Necessity of his Circumstances, which so far wrought on this charitable Gentleman's good Nature, that he not only defray'd the Charge of his Passage to <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-9">

He remained for some small Time in this humble Situation, but prepossessed with the Perfections of his Person, which he had the Vanity to think might induce some of the compassionate and Merit-decerning Fair, to raise him from his present Obscurity, provided he could find Means to set off his personal Talent to proper Advantage by the Help of a genteel Dress, to procure which Money was necessary, and for that Purpose he set all his Wits to work to raise the necessary Funds for supplying his Wardrobe. He had experienced the Colonel's good Nature on several Occassions, and had the Assurance to propose to him to send him a Sum of Money to be employed in Purchase of a Pair of C lours; though if he really had succeeded in his impudent Request, he intended only to have equipped himself for a Fortune-hunting Campaign. He was justly disappointed in his Suit, and at last was in downright Earnest, for the Sake of Bread, willing to enlist in Lord Albemarle's Troop of Horse-Guards: But even this could not be effected without Money, and though but ten Guineas was only wanting, he could not, without the Help of his Patron, raise this small Sum.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175010030006"/>
            <p>The Colonel at his Importunity was prevailed on to agree to lodge the Money in the Hands of an Officer belonging to the Troop, with which Mr. Maclean seemed satisfied, but after his Pass and other necessary Credentials for joining the Troop then in Flanders, were made out, his Inclination to a Military Life evapored, and he once more enlisted himself in the Service of the Fair, by whose Interest he procured the charitable Contribution of fifty-Pounds, under pretence of shipping himself for the West-Indies. But being once possessed of the Cash, he changed his Mind as totravelling, laid it out in fine Cloaths, and made Suit to the Daughter of Mr. Macglogno, a Dealer in Horses, with whom he was so lucky as to succeed, and with her received about five hundred Pounds, as her Marriage Portion.</p>

While his Wife lived he kept even with the World, and maintained his Family in Decency, though with much Difficulty; for he was more the Man of Pleasure than Business. Those who knew him at that Time generally say he was a harmless inoffensive Man; but being surpriz'd at his Way of Life, were apt to suggest strange Things of him, but no one could lay any thing that was wicked and notorious to his charge, while he lived in that Neighbourhood. His Wife died about 3 Years after their Marriage, leaving him two Daughters, of whom on her Death, her Mother took Charge, as she does still of the one that is so unhappy as to survive him.</p>
            <p>Deprived of his Wife, who had managed all the Affairs of his Shop and Business, he was too much addicted to Idleness and Pleasure, to confine himself to the Occupation of a Grocer, he sold off his Goods, and with the Remains of his Effects, which he had not augmented, but greatly diminished by Trade, he commenced Gentleman and Fortune-Hunter.</p>
            <p>He was scarce six Months embark'd in this fallacious Project, before he had in Folly and Extravagance exhausted all he had left of his late Wife's Portion, and was at a Loss how to raise any more to supply present Necessity much less to support the Figure he made. It went to his Soul to descend again from the fine Gentleman to the menial Servant, and he soon grew melancholy on the (to him) dreadful Prospect of being oblig'd to dispose of his Cloaths and Equipage for mere Bread. He was in this Disposition when he was visited by a Countryman of his, one Plunket, bred a Surgeon or Apothecary. His Friend in a famlliar Way ask'd the Cause of his Melancholy, on which the other open'd his real Circumstances, to which he was not before a Stranger. Honey, says Plunket, I thought, Maclean, thou hadst Spirit and Resolution, with some Knowledge of the World. A brave Man cannot want; he has a Right to live, and need not want the Conveniencies of Life, while the dull, plodding, busy Knaves carry Cash in their Pockets. We must draw upon them to supply our Wants, there need only Impudence, and getting the better of a few silly Scruples; there is scarce Courage necessary, all we have to deal with are such mere Poltroons. This Discourse was soon understood by the unhappy Maclean, who tho' at first shock'd with the bare Mention of it, yet the Necessity of his Pride and Indolence suggested so strong, that he yielded to the Temptation, and from that Time, which might be about eight Months after his Wife's Death, enter'd into a particular Intimacy with Plunket, agreed to run all Risques together, and, present or absent at any Enterprize, to share all Profits, of which, till the fatal Discovery, they kept a fair and regular Account.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175010030007"/>
            <p>Tho' Maclean believ'd himself possessed of, and it is not improbable really was possessed of as much natural Courage as any Man, yet on his first Attempt (nor could even long Practice harden him) he felt every Symptom of Fear and Cowardice, aggravated by the Stings of Conscience, which Vice could not harden. However, the Success of this first Enterprize, was (on a Grazier's coming from Smithfield Market, from whom, on <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-13">

In this Transaction he was no more than passive, stood by without speaking a Word, or so much as drawing his Pistol, and inwardly in greater Agony than the Man that was robbed; so that if any Resistance had been made, he had certainly taken the first Hint of taking to his Heels. However, the Man parted peaceably with hisMoney, and they had Time to divide it, and squander it without Suspicion or Molestation.</p>
            <p>The next Robbery they committed was on a Coach in the Road from <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-14">

By Agreement he was to stop the Coachman, and present his Pistol at one Side, while Plunket did the same on the other. But though he rode frequently up with Intention to give the Word, yet his Heart fail'd him, and Plunket, lest they should miss the Booty, did it himself, and it was with some faultering Maclean demanded their Money after the Coach was stopt, and no Danger seem'd near. However, he grew more resolute, and to redeem his Credit with Plunket, who began to rally him with some Freedom, on his Pusilanimity, he robb'd once in Hyde-Park by himself, a Gentleman on Horseback, of his Watch and Money, and was the acting Man in the Robbery of

            <p>He reign'd long and successfully, and was never but once afraid of a Discovery; at that Time he went over to <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-15">

After he had staid some Time in <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-16">

            <p>With these Collections from the Publick, he lived in Splendor, but to avoid impertinent Questions, often shifted his Lodgings; though he appeared in the greatest Splendor in all publick Places, and kept Company not only with the most noted Ladies of the Town, but some Women of Fortune and Reputation were unguarded enough to admit him into their Company, without any other Recommendation than his appearing at all public Places with great Impudence, and a Variety of rich Cloaths. He had the good Fortune, even to make some Progress in the Affections of a Lady who really deserved a better Fate, but his Character was blown by a Gentleman, who knew him too well to think himself obliged to accept of a Challenge sent him on that Account by Maclean, and the Lady saved from total Ruin.</p>
            <p>By this Means he supply'd all the Extravagance of his Disposition; yet he never once thought of his Daughter, or seldom visited his Mother-in-Law, who took Care of her; and least he should be plagued with her Importunities, or that she might take the Liberty of a Person so nearly concern'd in him, to ask about the Means of his gay Appearance, he made his Visits short and seldom, and always conceal'd from her his Abode.</p>
            <p>He thought this Course would never have an End, but he was mistaken; Justice, tho' slow, at last took hold of him, and even made himself, chiefly, instrumental in doing Justice to the Laws of his Country, he had so long violated with Impunity; for it is to be observed, and he often made the Remark himself, that if a particular Fate had not directed him to dispose of the Goods in the Manner he did it, and to strengthen the Suspicion by a judicial Confession, there were, as yet, no Man but Plunket his Accomplice, that could hurt him. But whom God will punish he first makes mad; so it happen'd with Maclean in the Robbery for which he was condemn'd. For after he had, on the 26th of June, robb'd the Salisbury Stage-Coach of their Money, and two Port-manteaus; and the same Morning, by an Artifice, robb'd Lord Eglinton who was so good-natur'd as not to appear against him, they divided the Spoil at Mr. Maclean's Lodgings, who was so infatuated, tho' the Cloaths were advertised and described in the public Papers, to offer the Lace strip'd off Mr. Higden's Waistcoat, to the very Laceman from whom it had been bought; and to desire a Salesman to come to his Lodgings to purchase the Cloaths, who</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175010030008"/>
            <p>bought them, and by whose Means Mr. Higden was brought to view them, knew his Property, and had Mr. Macklean immediately taken up by a Warrant, and carried before Justice Lediard, before whom, he at first deny'd the Fact, but afterwards sent for that Gentleman to the Gate-house, and acquainted him, that he intended to make a Confession. The Justice told him candidly, that if he could impeach but one, his Confession would be of little Use to him, and recommended him to take an Hour to consider of it. He came to him again at the Expiration of that Time, and he still insisted that he had no Accomplice but Plunket. On the 1st of August he was brought to his second Examination, before Mr. Justice Lediard, at which Time, he delivered his Confession in Writing, but not sign'd, which the Justice did not desire him to do, and then left the Papers in his Hands, without asking them from him. He shew'd a mean dastardly Spirit before the Justice, shed many Tears, which enduced the female Part of his Audience to accompany him, and some to present him with a Purse of Money, which, with other compassionate Contributions from the same weak Quarters, he lived at the Gatehouse with as much Ease as a tortured Conscience, and natural Dread of Death could permit him. The Notice taken of him by some Persons of female Distinction, perhaps, gave him some Hopes of Life, which never left him 'till he left <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-17">

                        targets="OA17501003n25-1 OA17501003-geo-18"/>Ireland</placeName>, well known for his zeal and affection to the present royal family, and happy government; who bestowed an education upon me becoming his character, of which I have in my hand a certificate from a noble lord, four members of parliament, and several justices of peace for the county where I was born, and received my education.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of the late French war, my Lord, I came to London, with a design to enter into the military service to my king and country; but unexpected disappointments oblig'd me to change my resolution; and having married the daughter of a reputable tradesman, to her fortune I added what little I had of my own, and entered into trade in the grocery way, and remained therein till my wife died. I very quickly after her death found a decay in trade, arising from an unavoidable trust reposed in servants; and fearing the consequence, I candidly consulted some friends, and, by their advice, sold off my stock, and in the first place, honestly discharged my debts, and proposed to apply the residue of my fortune in the purchase of some military employment, agreeable to my first design.</p>
            <p>During my application to my trade, my Lord, I unhappily became acquainted with one Plunket, an apothecary, who, by his account of himself, induced me to believe he had travelled abroad, and was possessed of cloaths, and other things suitable thereto, and prevailed on me to employ him in attending on my family, and to lend him money, to the amount of 100 l. and upwards.</p>
            <p>When I left off trade, I pressed Plunket for payment, and, after receiving, by degrees, several sums, he proposed, on my earnestly insisting that I must call in all debts owing to me, to pay me part in goods and part in money.</p>
            <p>These very cloaths, with which I am now charged, my Lord, were cloaths he brought to me to make sale of, towards payment of my debt, and accordingly, my Lord, I did sell them, very unfortunately, as it now appears; little thinking they were come by in the manner Mr. Higden hath been pleased to express, whose word and honour are too well known to doubt the truth.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175010030009"/>
            <p>My Lord, as the contracting this debt between Plunket and myself was of a private nature, so was the payment of it; and therefore, it is impossible for me to have the testimony of any one single witness to these facts, which (as it is an unavoidable misfortune) I hope, anddoubt not, my Lord, that your Lordship and the gentlemen of the Jury will duly weigh.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I cannot avoid observing to your Lordship, is it probable, nay, is it possible, that, if I had come by those cloaths by dishonest means, I should be so imprudent as to bring a man to my lodgings at noon-day to buy them, and give him my name and place of residence, and even write that name and residence myself in the saleman's book? It seems to me, and I think must to every man, a madness, that no one, with the least share of sense, could be capable of.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have observed in the course of Mr. Higden's evidence, he hath declared, he could not be positive either to my face or person; the defect of which, I humbly presume, leaves a doubt of the certainty of my being one of the two persons.</p>
            <p>My Lord, it is very true, when I was first apprehended, the surprize confounded me, and gave me the most extraordinary shock; it caused a delirium and confusion in my brain, which rendered me incapable of being myself, or knowing what I said or did; I talked of robberies, as another man would do in talking of stories; but, my Lord, after my friends had visited me in the Gatehouse, and had given me some new spirits; and, when I came to be reexamined before justice Lediard, and then asked, if I could make any discovery of the robbery, I then alledged that I had recovered my surprize, that what I had talked of before concerning robberies was false and wrong, and intirely owing to a confused head and brain.</p>
            <p>This, my Lord, being my unhappy fate; but, unhappy as it is, as your Lordship is my judge and presumptive council, I submit it, whether there is any other evidence against me than circumstantial.</p>
            <p>First, the selling of the lace and cloaths, which I agree I did; for which I account.</p>
            <p>Second, the verbal confession of a confused brain; for which I account.</p>
            <p>All this evidence I humbly apprehend is but circumstantial evidence.</p>
            <p>It might be said, my Lord, that I ought to shew where I was at this Time.</p>
            <p>To which, my Lord, I answer, that I never heard the time, nor the day of the month, that Mr. Higden was robbed; and, my Lord, it is impossible for me, at this juncture, to recollect where I was, and much less to bring any testimony of it.</p>
            <p>My Lord, in cases where a prisoner lies under these impossibilities of proof, it is hard, nay, it is very hard, if presumption and intendment may not have some weight on the side of the prisoner. I humbly hope, and doubt not, but that doctrine will not escape your Lordship's memory to the jury.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have lived in credit, and have had dealings with mankind, and therefore humbly beg leave, my Lord, to call about a score to my character, or more, if your Lordship pleases; and then, my Lord, if in your Lordship's opinion, the evidence against me should be by law only circumstantial, and the character given of me by my witnesses should be so far satisfactory, as to have equal weight, I shall most readily and willingly submit to the jury's verdict.</p>
            <p>The Evidence being plain, the jury brought him in Guilty without going out of court; at the time of receiving sentence he attempted to read a paper, but was so much disordered by grief, dread, or guilt, that he could not proceed; the paper is as follows.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I shall not presume to trouble your lordship with many professions of sorrow and penitence; such from men in my unhappy condition, are too often considered to proceed more from fear and shame, than a heart justly touched with a deep sense and abhorrence of my past inexcusable conduct. - Were the sentiments of my soul this moment disclosed to the world in their true light, I should have no occasion to use any expressions to move compassion. - For the best of men are the readiest to pity the anguish of their fellow-creatures not hardened in guilt. - I might, perhaps, collect some circumstances to mitigate the execution of a sentence I am now going to receive, - but, as I am sensible that nothing of that sort on my trial escaped the penetration of the court. So I am equally assured, that if there is room for mercy, it will be recommended.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175010030010"/>
            <p>My Lord, it is for my offences against heaven and the publick; it is for my family disgraced, for a helpless infant daughter, that my heart is weighed down with contrite anguish, and dares not with confidence apply to the great and good. - And yet, my Lord, permit me to implore so much mercy as will for ever remove me from being a disgrace to those who once knew me worthy of a better fate, and will enable me topass the remainder of my days in penitence and sorrowful obscurity.</p>
            <p>The reader may observe mention here made of his brother, whose Letter hinted at on the trial, has so much christian charity, honesty, and humanity in it. that I can not deny it a place here, though it would have done Mr. Maclean no hurt if it had been kept more private.</p>

            <p>Utrecht, Aug. 17, N.S. 1750.</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>I Received your melancholy letter, but the dismal news it contained had reached me here before it arrived, as I have been happily absent from the Hague some time.</p>
            <p>I never thought any belonging to me would have loaded me with such heart-breaking affection, as the infamous crimes of him whom I will call brother no more, have brought upon me; how often, and how solemnly have I admonished him, of the miserable consequences of an idle life, and, alas! to no purpose!</p>
            <p>However that be, I have made all the application possible for his life, filled with shame and confusion, that I have been obliged to make demands so contrary to justice, and hardly knowing with what face to do it, in the character I bear as a minister of truth and righteousness.</p>
            <p>"It is the interest of some friends, I have</p>
            <p>"made here, that can only save his life: They</p>
            <p>"have lost no time in applying, and I hope their</p>
            <p>"endeavours will be successful; but I still hope</p>
            <p>"more, that if providence should so order events,</p>
            <p>"as that he escapes the utmost rigour of the</p>
            <p>"law, and has that life prolonged, he does not deserve</p>
            <p>"to enjoy any longer, I hope, or rather</p>
            <p>"with, that in such a case he may have a</p>
            <p>"proper sense and feeling of his enormous crimes,</p>
            <p>"which lay ample foundation for drawing out</p>
            <p>"the wretched remainder of his days in sorrow</p>
            <p>"and repentance.</p>
            <p>"With respect to me, it would give me consolation,</p>
            <p>"if I could hope that this would be the</p>
            <p>"issue of his trials; it would comfort me on</p>
            <p>"his account, as he is a man, because I will</p>
            <p>"never acknowledge him in any nearer relation;</p>
            <p>"and because, except such good offices as former</p>
            <p>"ties, and present humanity demands from</p>
            <p>"me in his behalf, I am never to have any further</p>
            <p>"correspondence with him during this mortal</p>
            <p>"life.</p>
            <p>"I have given orders to look towards his</p>
            <p>"confidence, and what is necessary for it.</p>
            <p>"I am obliged to you. Sir for your attention</p>
            <p>"in communicating to me this dismal</p>
            <p>"news, and shall willingly embrance any Opportunity</p>
            <p>"of shewing myself,</p>
            <p>Sir, Your most, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>P. S.</p>
            <p>"If you see this my unhappy brother,</p>
            <p>"let him know my compassion for his misery,</p>
            <p>"as well as my indignation against his crimes,</p>
            <p>"and also that I shall omit nothing in my</p>
            <p>"power to have his sufferings mitigated; - he</p>
            <p>"has. I fear, broken my heart, and will make</p>
            <p>"me draw on the rest of my days in sorrow."</p>
            <p>He was soon disabused as to the Hopes of Life raised by this Letter, but not so soon of his Interest with his fair Friends; however, that did not intirely lay aside his Thoughts of Eternity, though it might distract his Thoughts and abate the Fervour of his Devotion, which ought to make every Man cautious how he gives Encouragement to such dangerous Expectations, without having it in his Power or Inclination to perform them, they my be a real Injury, where they mean only Mercy and Humanity.</p>

In short, he was not arrogant enough to brave Death, nor so much wedded to Life, as to dread it like a Coward.</p>

            <p>Mr Smith had Talents, and a Genius that might not only secure him from the Temptations of Want, but that if properly applied and accompanied with Industry, Honesty and Application, might have rendered him anuseful Member of Society, and enabled him to live in Affluence. His Capacity may be easily gathered from his Writings, published in the Daily Papers, on the unhappy Occasion of his Condemnation, all which were penn'd by himself. But unhappily for him, his Abilities only served to aggravate his Guilt, and gave him Opportunities of doing Mischief, and entering into wicked Plots and Contrivances, that a Man of less Genius could not think of When he had got Money by the most iniquitous Ways, it was soon squandered in Riot and Excess; OEconomy was a Virtue he had an utter Abhorrence to, tho' no Man dreaded and hated Want more than he did, yet he never could prevail on himself to take honest Means to prevent his Necessities, and would often spend twice as much Time in contriving and executing a fraudulent Design, as might, if industriously employed, have brought him in more Profit in an honest Way.</p>
            <p>He was perfectly Master of the Art of Dissimulation, and had a peculiar Talent in engaging People to commiserate and relieve his almost constant. Necessities he lived in. When in Company of any but his Associates in Iniquity, he might be mistaken for the most upright and honest Man alive, which induced several to be his Dupes, till a little further Dealings with him discovered the Villain, without one Grain of Honesty or Gratitude; there is one Instance amongst many, that shews both his Talent of stealing upon People's Passions, by a mournful Tale, and the base, ungrateful Spirit he had for the most obliging Favours. The Instance is this;</p>

            <p>Some Time ago Smith, who made a very mean Appearance both in Body and Apparel, was met in the Streets by a Friend of his, who was surprized to find him in such a Garb, and expressed his Surprize by telling him at the same Time, that surely a Man with his Capacity need never appear so wretched; Smith excused himself by telling him, a Disorder of Body, which he had for some Time been under, render'd him incapable to think of doing any Thing, and at the same Time was ashamed, on account of his Dress, to appear before his Friends, from whom he might expect Relief. The Gentleman, his Friend, taking Compassion on his Distress, desired him to come to him next Morning, which he did, and was cloathed from Head to Feet in a decent Manner, and had also from his Friend a Letter of Recommendation to one of the most eminent Physicians, to whom he apply'd, and by whose Skill, as he knew the Gentleman who recommended him, he was made whole; after which neither the Physician nor his Friend saw him again for some Time, 'till his Friend, to his very great Surprize, met him one Day in the Streets in the same mean Garb as before. Astonish'd at the Sight, he demanded the Reason; Smith, with much seeming Grief, told him a lamentable Story of his being so much in Debt for Lodging, Board, &amp;c. that he was obliged to sell those Cloaths he had so kindly given him to satisfy Creditors, and furnish bare Necessaries of Life; adding withal, that as the Doctor of Physick had, with so much Kindness and Humanity, made him well, he could not help owning his Ingratitude in not waiting on him to return him Thanks, which he was ashamed to do in such mean Appearance. In short, this Gentleman, Smith's Friend, had the good Nature to cloath him from Head to Foot again. When Smith was thus equipped, away he marches to the Doctor's, was admitted into his Study, where he told him he was the Person he had lately been so good as to cure, by the Recommendation of * * * * *; the Doctor then remembred him again, wish'd him Joy of his Health, and kindly enquired after the Health of his Friend. And now mark the Gratitude flowing from the honest Heart of this Villain! He instantly pull'd out a Pistol, and holding it to the Doctor's Head, told him he was an unfortunate Gentleman, and wanted Money, and threatned to blow out his Brains if he did not instantly furnish him with fiveGuineas; the Doctor, with a good deal of Calmness, told him he might act as he pleased with his Pistol, but he was sure he durst not fire it off, for if he did, and kill'd him, it was a Matter of Indifference to him, who had already (as he told him) one Foot in the Grave, and he was sure of being taken by his Servants, and as sure of being hang'd for it; he therefore told him his belt Way was to walk off, and be glad he was permitted so to do, but as to the five Guineas he demanded he should not give it him. On this, Smith immediately; reflecting on his ticklish Situation, and fearing he should be taken, knew not how to behave, but fell down upon his Knees, and had Recourse to that dissembling, deceitful Member his Tongue, which he knew so well how to employ, that he, by his melancholy, doleful Tale, so touched the Heart of the Doctor, that, moved by his Distress, he put his Hand in his Pocket and gave him three Guineas, advised him to follow better Courses, and suffered him to go away unmolested.</p>
            <p>After a Circumstance of this kind, the Reader can be at no Loss to form a Character of what this Man once was, nor at all surprised that such Principles at last led him to a violent and shameful Death.</p>
            <p>He was ungrateful to all, and willing to defraud every Man he could; but he put his Tricks oftenest upon his Friends and Acquaintance, as was the Case of the Fact for which he was tried and condemned.</p>
            <p>He was at the Time of hatching this black Design in one of his necessitous Fits, and so reduced that he knew not where to raise a Shilling, except by Application to some kind of Business, a Thing he hated, very near, as much as Want. In this Exigence, he happened to meet accidentally in the Street with Mr.

            , an old Acquaintance, whose good Nature he had often experienc'd, and passing along with him, before they parted, unluckily for all Parties, saw Mr. Weeks receive a Letter with a Bill of Exchange in it, for 45 l. which he left with a Friend till he should call for it, and received 10 l.</p>
            <p>They parted for that Time, but the Sight of the Money put several strange Notions and Wishes into the indigent Smith's Head He wanted much, he had the strong Plea of Necessity no Gratitude nor Honesty to crush the vislainous Thought; in short, he was determined to have by some Means or other, tho' the direct Manner was not yet formed into Project.</p>
            <p>In the Interim Mr. Weeks fell indisposed and was confined to his Room for some Days. This was an Opportunity not to be lost, Mr. Smith pretends likewise to be sick, and to keep his Room, but took Care to lay in Wait, and intercepted Mr. Weeks' second Letter of Advice, with a second Bill of Exchange, as is usual, left the former should miscarry, and made Use of it with Mr. Weeks's Receipt forged, to receive the Remainder, which was 35 l. as his own Account of the Matter, and the Money was instantly paid. Smith now out of his Pinch, immediately sets out for Holland, not doubting but a few Days would discover the Fraud, as it actually did; for Mr. Weeks going in a few Days for his Money, or some other Affair, to the Friend with whom he left the first Bill, he was surprized with a Receipt for 45 l. in his Name, but he soon knew the Hand, and went in Search of Smith, but Smith was eloped, and no-where to be heard of.</p>
            <p>But this unhappy young Man had run has Length of Wickedness, the Hand of Justice must strike some Time, and then most severely when longest delayed. Smith, it would appear, was strongly connected with Paterson in that infamous Plot upon an honourable Gentleman, and though they had missed their Aim, their Malice was not abated; for there is great Grounds to believe, that a Project, relating to this Affair, brought Smith once more over into <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-47">

The Gentleman would have excused seeing him without sending in his Name, but was at last prevailed on to come down to him.</p>
            <p>Smith addressed him in a formal Manner, asking him if he knew one Paterson, and told him, that he had a Bond of Paterson's in his Hands for 150 l. which he would give up for any small Matter Mr. W - should think proper, which Bond Smith since de clared was absolutely and entirely a Forgery of his own, but that indeed he and Paterson had before been concerned in extorting Money from a Gentleman after the same Manner, which they did effect.</p>

            <p>When he came to be examined, he protested the Honesty of his Intentions, kept his Tale pretty well connected; and though he was examined three or four Days following by different Justices, there was nothing to be made of him, but only he said his Name was Sandys, and that he was the Son of a Man of Note at Andover; but his Manner of Speech laving him under strong Suspicion of being an Irishman, he was confined in <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-50">

            <p>Mr. Lord, I am unhappy enough to stand here indicted for a Fact, which I perceive my Prosecutor is ready to prove against me; therefore, from a Consciousness of it, and to prevent giving the Court any unnecessary Trouble. I do confess my Guilt, and submissively rely on the Favour of the Court to intercede for my Life. - My Lord, I have thus much to say in Alleviation of my Crime, that this is the first Time I ever appeared before a Court of Justice in an ignominious Manner; that a Case of Necessity urged me to commit the Fact I am charged with; and that my Heart is full of Sorrow and Contrition for it. If, therefore, your Lordship, or Mr. Recorder, will be pleased to report me in this favourable Light to his Majesty, or the Lords in Power, it will, I hope, be the happy Means of inducing them to extend their Clemency towards me: But if I am so unfortunate as not to be thought an Object worthy their Compassion, I trust that the Lord of Heaven and Earth will have Mercy on me. - His Prosecutor begged Mercy for him of the Court.</p>
            <p>And at the Time of receiving Sentence, he deliver'd himself in a very moving and pathetic Speech, which is as follows.</p>
            <p>My Lord, to what I said on the Day of my Trial, I have only on this melancholy Occasion to add, that my humble Confession then, proceeded from a sincere Compunction of Heart, in Abhorrence of my Crime. I therefore now servently pray, that the Almighty, who is the bright Fountain of Mercy, will inspire his Majesty's Royal Breast with Sentiments of Compassion towards me, and that, in Consideration of my unfeigned Sorrow and Penitence, he will be most graciously pleased to restore me my forfeited Life; a Life only sought to atone for the Errors of the past, and to pray for my Preservers.</p>

His Heart seem'd to be effectually touch'd, and express'd the greatest and most unseigned Horror, Shame, and Compunction for the Wickedness of his past Life, and did not neglect any Circumstance that could aggravate his Sense of Guilt, and augment his Contrition. He wish'd for Life rather to employ it in Repentance, than for the Sake of Enjoyment, in which he never could have any Relish. But though he wish'd, and the Tenderness of his Prosecutor, who had recommended him to the Mercy of the Court, gave him some glimmering Hope, yet as he had no Friend to intercede for him with the Regency, he built very little on it, but prepar'd seriously for Eternity. However, not to be wanting to himself, and that he might do all to preserve his Life that Prudence could dictate, he form'd that warm and melancholy Petition, which he had no other Way to introduce to the Hands of Men in Power, but by publishing it in the News-Papers. It had some Effect, but not the Effect he wish'd; its pathetic Style oblig'd many to compassionate his Miseries, aad even some to endeavour to serve him with Men in Power. But Providence had set Limits to his Life, and he was not deem'd a fit Object of Mercy.</p>
            <p>In the first Transports of his Agonies, on finding himself in the Dead Warrant, and for some Time after, he inveigh'd bitterly against an honourable Gentleman already hinted at, blaming him as the sole Cause of his being excluded from Royal Mercy; but being exhorted to a contrary Way of thinking, was persuaded, and when he came to recollect himself, his Passion subsided, and he was less severe in his Reflections; and when his Fetters were knock'd off, on the Question being ask'd, if he still blamed him, he said, he did not, and freely forgave him.</p>
            <p>His Irons were no sooner off, than he kneeled down in the Press-Yard, and addressed his Maker in an extempore Prayer, full of Penitence and Resignation, and delivered it with such a moving Sort of Voice, and such Justness of Action, that all that heard him were exceedingly mov'd. He did the same when he went into the Cart, and at the Conclusion all the By-standers said Amen to his pious Petitions for Peace, Mercy, and Grace. In a Word, the Whole of his Conduct, from his coming into <placeName id="OA17501003-geo-54">

            <p>As he had no Friends to look after his Funeral, he petition'd the Publick for Charity on that Score, in a Petition publish'd in the London Gazetteer; and is as follows.</p>
            <p>In vain has Mercy been intreated, the Vengeance of Heaven has overtaken me; I bow myself unrepining to the fatal Stroke. Thanks to my all gracious Creator, Thanks to my most merciful Saviour, I go prepared to launch into the irremeable Gulph of Eternity.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175010030018"/>
            <p>Oh! my poor Soul, how strongly dost thou hope for the Completion of eternal Felicity? Almighty Jehovah, I am all Resignation to thy blessed Will; Immaculate Jesus, oh! send some ministring Angel to conduct me to the bright Mansion of celestial Happiness. As to my corporeal Frame, I know it is unworthy of material Notice; but, for the Sake of that reputable Family from whence I am descended, I cannot refrain from Anxiety, when I think how easily this poor Body, in my friendless and necessitous Condition, may fail into the Possession of the Surgeons, and perpetuate my Disgrace beyond the Severity of the Law; so great an Impoverishment has my long Confinement brought upon me, that I have not a Shilling left for Subsistence, much less for procuring the Decency of an Interment Therefore, most servently do I intreat the generously humane and charitably compossionate, to afford me such a Contribution is may be sufficient to protect my dead Body from Indecency, and to give me Consolation of being assured, that my poor Ashes shall be decently deposited within the Limits of a consecrated Ground. The Deprivation of Life is a sufficient Punishment for my Crimes, even in the rigorous Eyes of offended Justice; after Death, the Law has permitted my Remains to pass without further Ignomicy Then why should Inhumanity lay her butchering Hands on an inoffensive Carcase? Ah! give me the Satisfactionof thinking I shall return to my Parent Dust, within the Confines of a Grave. Those who compassionate my deplorable Situation, are humbly desired to send their humane Contributions to Mrs. Browning's, next Door to the Golden Acorn in Little Wild-Street; and that Heaven may reward their charitable Dispositions, is the dying Prayer of the lost and unhappy</p>

And he added moreover, that had he been at Liberty a Week longer, he was sure he should find the Man of whom he bought the Gelding, he was indicted for stealing, having often had Conversation with him, though he knew not his Name. He declared to die resigned to the Will of God, and recommending his Family to Almighty Protection, said, he hoped he should be happy in the World to come.</p>
