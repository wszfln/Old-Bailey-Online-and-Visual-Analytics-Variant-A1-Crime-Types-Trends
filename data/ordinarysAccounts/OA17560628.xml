He was about to rifle and search him further (which had he done, Parkin says, he would have found the value of sixty pounds good notes about him) but luckily for him, a coach and six was coming on the road towards them, and the highwayman chose to ride off. It was early in the morning when he was robbed, and as he was stopping to breakfast, a gentleman travelling to London, came also to the inn where he was, and they joined company.

He says, that during this time, his former itch after cock-fighting revived, and he was that way let into the secret by some of the young bloods of the town.</p>
            <p>His favourite extravagance in the country was cock-fighting, which cost him there more money than was right to lose, or even venture, at so mean a stake; but the expence there was not near so much as he was taken in for about town; and what with cock-fighting, some adventures with women of the town, and attendance at the play-houses, from the time of his coming to town, about the 11th of September, to the 23d of December, when he was apprehended, he had squandered away upwards of two hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>Besides other extravagancies, he scarce ever missed an evening being at one or both of the playhouses during this time; and what was strange, he was often at both houses the same evening, and at expences in both; so that he might go backwards and forwards to either, just as the maggot took him in the head.</p>
            <p>The very night he was apprehended, he was dressed like a gentleman of the first quality, and intended for the play, after having been at the expence of hiring a chaise for an airing in the country that very afternoon.</p>

He wrote into the country for supplies; but that not coming time enough, he betook himself to forgery; and so strange was his folly, as to put the notes into the hands of Mr. Blake, the prosecutor, to whose house he resorted almost every day, to visithis aunt, who lodged there, who gave him money for them. All this while he never thought of the time going on, nor that the day was coming when the notes, each for 10 l. would be due, and of course the fraud and felony detected, but kept on the same way of life he had before been used to.</p>
            <p>Mr. Blake, the prosecutor, found Parkin continued his visits to his aunt, who lodged in his house, and for some time was well satisfied about his 10 l. note. Some time after he brought another of 17 l. which, upon his saying 'twas drawn by a very good man, Mr. Blake let him also have the money for: and, we think proper to observe, as Parkin said, he never went in his gay dress to visit his aunt, but only in clean and plain apparel, lest he might give suspicion, since it was there too well known his circumstances would not admit of such extraordinary appearance, as he sometimes set up for in his dress.</p>
            <p>The 10 l. note had been paid away in trade, by Mr. Blake, before he offered the other of 17 l. for payment. When he did so, on the 23d of December last, the person upon whom it was drawn, told him, he knew nothing of it, denied the bill, and acceptance.</p>
            <p>Mr. Blake thus finding himself imposed upon, returned in search of Parkin, and found him in the evening of the same day at the playhouse, gaily dress'd out, in order to entertain himself at the play that night. He did not choose to go before the justice in that dress, and upon his desiring the favour, they suffer'd him to change his clothes, before he was taken to Mr. Fielding's, who committed him.</p>
            <p>He flattered himself with some false hopes, that the affair might be made up; and, to that purpose, got his trial put off in January sessions, hoping money might have been sent him to repay, as he wrote into the country to desire remittance; but, all to no purpose, having cost his friends, and expended too much money already. So in February sessions he was tried and convicted of the two indictments for forgery.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175606280008"/>
            <p>He behaved very decently upon his trial, and afterwards continued so to do, as far as I know. Interest was made for him, to save his life, by men who were of considerable figure in life, who backed his petitions for it with their recommendations of him, as a proper object of mercy, upon accountof his youth; but, when the report was made, and it appeared he was convicted by jury of two indictments for forgery, there was no room left for mitigation of the punishment.</p>
            <p>As such interest was making for him, he could not divest his mind of great hopes of having his life saved; tho' he was often told by his friends, the nature of his crime was such as would not admit of building too much upon his hopes, and 'twas better to prepare for the worst. And, tho' such admonition had frequently been repeated, yet when his four months hopes were all quashed, by being told he was ordered for execution in a few days, how was he shock'd at the first! How did his heart tremble, and he was afraid! The horrid news occasion'd tears for some hours, but as he thought thereon, and made the necessity of his fate more familiar, he became resigned to the will of that great God, who had suffered him thus to be taken away from the earth before he became a man in years, or understanding.</p>
            <p>He was, upon coming to town, betrayed into the juvenile follies of the present times, and has suffered for it. He was so ridiculously foolish, as to the offence that he suffer'd for, as to depend upon returns to be sent from the country, to pay the money back again, (tho' he knew none could be sent,) and thought then no harm would come of it. He knew 'twas grievously to be punished by the law, yet he hoped to escape. He freely own'd the justice of his suffering, and died resigned, in hope that God might be merciful unto him.</p>

            <p>The father was applied to, who declaring for what purpose he had brought him there, and that he could not carry on his business without his assistance, the gentleman offered to hire a person to work in his room, if he might be along with him.</p>
            <p>It was agreed, and while the job of work lasted, which, he says, was two years, he attended upon the gentleman, and went with him wherever he went, in capacity of a servant-boy: the job being finished, the father soon after returned to <placeName id="OA17560628-geo-30">

He had contracted a habit of idleness, which took his mind off from what he was at first intended for. There was now no keeping him at home, but, prodigal like, away he goes, takes himself from his father's care and protection, who meant to do the best in his power for him; and now, lurking up and down the town, of course he fell into all sorts of bad company, which never fails to make the most of such unguarded youth, and by degrees brought him to destruction.

Of all days in the week, instead of going to church to do their duty to God, they chose Sunday to go about town and country, seeking what opportunity might present for their purpose; and this they did, because then, having their best cloaths on, they did not so soon create suspicion: But Sunday only would not answer their demands long, and in a short time it became with them the practice of every day in the week.</p>

This was the first time he had ever been in the hands of justice, though he had a long time been in the way of it, and in danger.

             was afterwards taken, and tried last January sessions, for being concerned in the same fact for which Pryer and West suffered death. Cane in this indictment was also evidence, and Banks was convicted; though the jury being so merciful as to overlook burglary, he was found guilty only of stealing, and accordingly transported. Cane on that trial declared upon oath, that Banks was one of those persons that was the occasion of his leaving his parents, who, he said, carried the hod for his father, who was a plaisterer, and they went together picking of pockets.</p>
            <p>One would have thought this was some mark of regret for what was past; and as he had got rid of this knot, by hanging two, and transporting the other concerned with him, he would have returned home; but notwithstanding, he soon found out new companions, who have only served him as he served others, and brought him to the gallows.</p>
            <p>Cane acknowledged to have been, for about four years past, a professed pickpocket and house-breaker, who had the good luck to escape unapprehended till about a year and half ago. He says, in his serious hours (which have been very few in the four years, free from debauch of some kind or other) he thought of nothing less than hanging to be his fate at last, but not of the evil day's coming so soon; though had it been ever so long</p>

Cole, the evidence against him, being afterwards taken, and owning several robberies and burglaries, in which Cane had been concerned with him, he was taken again, with one Williams.

With their booty they got clear off for that time, and sold them to

Of all bad practices, this of receiving stolen goods, which the receivers buy almost for nothing, is the worst. If these worse than thieves could but be brought to justice as oft as the thieves, 'tis likely burglaries would soon be at an end, for want of villains to receive.</p>
            <p>Cane, as observed before, was taken up on suspicion, but set at liberty again, as he steadfastly denied every thing he was taxed with; and, he says, 'twas always his fixed resolution so to do, after he had been evidence against the abovementioned persons, because he knew he should never be admitted evidence again by any justice that had heard of his same. But, when Cole was taken, and owned every thing, as above, Cane thought it was all over, and he no longer persisted in denial, as he found it in vain. And, upon Cole's confession, Cane was committed, and upon tryal, fairly convicted.</p>
            <p>Tho' he had been a sad, reprobate, hardened, young wretch, upon conviction, he began to grow dejected, and owned he expected no mercy here. He behaved, when I saw him, with decency and composure; and, having a sense of the wicked life he had led, he acknowledged the justness of his suffering, and, placing his expectations of hereafter, on the mercies of God, he had some faint hope of acceptance with him, through the merits of his son Jesus Christ.</p>
