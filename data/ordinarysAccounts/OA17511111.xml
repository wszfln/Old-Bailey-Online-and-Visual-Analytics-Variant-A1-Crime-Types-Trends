Unfortunately, perhaps, for him, his Father died, when he was about twelve Months old; so he was left to the Care of a Mother, whose Fondness brought him up tenderly; and she kept him to School, at the Expence of the Produce of her own Pains and Industry, till he was about 10 Years of Age. About that Time she met with a worthy Friend, who found Means to provide, that the Boy might be taken off her Hands: And from this Time he was put into, and bred at another School, till of riper Years, he grew fit to be put out Apprentice. There he learned to read, write, and cast Accounts,</p>

            <p>as is the usual Method to fit Youth to go into Life, and follow that which is good, unless the Depravity of their own Temper, or the Prevalence of evil Company induce them to pursue another Way of Life, which their Education was intended to guard them against.</p>
            <p>In this unhappy Youth both the above melancholy Circumstances seemed to concur to work his Destruction as to this Life. He was a Youth of some Vivacity, tho' a certain Sullenness seemed to set upon his Brow, and he was impatient always of Reproof, which was frequently necessary, as he was always an unlucky one, and ready at all Manner of boyish Mischief.</p>
            <p>About the Age of 15 Years he was put <rs id="OA17511111-occupation-13" type="occupation">Apprentice to a Hot-presser and Dyer</rs>

            <p>During this Time not any Charge or Suspicion of Dishonesty was alledged against him, so far as we have heard or found; but he began to grow less diligent in his Business, which occasioned Words, and he being yet of a Temper impatient of Reproof, took in Dudgeon what was said to him on that Occasion, and was about to determine upon leaving his Master. However, he bore with it for some Weeks, and staid in his Service, tho' he grew more uneasy every Day; for Occasions of Complaint against him encreasing, as he grew more negligent; of Consequence Reproofs grew so much the severer. He grew hardened under it, nor suffered it to take Place, and the more he was galled at it, the more uneasy he was, till he was out of the hearing of it. The Case with Holmes seems just the same as with most of those unhappy Creatures. When once they have gone on a while in evil Courses, nothing shall put a Stop to them, but what stops their Breath; but was greater Care taken to keep them to labour six Days, and to their Duty to God the seventh Day, the Case might have been otherwise, and many more useful Members of Society might have been brought up, who are cut off frequently in their Prime for Want of better Regulation.</p>
            <p>His Negligence grew habitual, and every Call to Business disagreeable; his Service was no longer pleasing, nor would he at any Rate stay; but, as the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, left his Father rashly, and to his great Detriment and Grief after he was gone; so fared it with this unhappy Youth presently after he had left his Master. He soon spent what little he had, and Poverty and Starving stared him in the Face. What should he do? His wearing Apparel, and every Thing else next followed; being either pawn'd or sold, and he was left almost naked.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175111110005"/>
            <p>He did not say but that his Master had been used to behave to him as one in his Situation could wish a Master to do; and, he said often, he wished his Example might be a Warning to all Apprentices, how they throw themselves out of Business, and think to providebetter for themselves, than their Friends have done. With him it was all Caprice, and not Reason: The Infatuation of his own Humour, and unsteady Temper, took Occasion to remove him, about nine Months ago, from such Service and Duty, as, attended to, might in Time have made him a Man, and been a Means to carry him safe through the World.</p>
            <p>But now Idleness had led him into the Company of loose and bad Men. All was gone; what should he do for more? He could not keep such Company long, without helping to pay the Expence of their Revellings. To dig he was ashamed, and was quite tired of Business. What he had sold his Goods for lasted not long: About this unhappy Juncture, who should fall in his Way, as an Engine of the Devil, to compleat his Ruin, but

David enquired of him, among other Things, what Way of Life he led, and how he got his Bread?

            <p>Upon which Davy perceiving his Necessity, and looking upon him as a proper Object for him to work upon, told him it was a Pity he should starve in a Country of Plenty.

            <p>With some Reluctance at first, Holmes says, he consented; but it appears, that when he was once enter'd into the Practise, he was active and desperate as any other Person could be. Custom in sinning wore out, and effaced all Principles of Good; and Industry and Honesty being at an End, he began to be as abandoned as ever Wretch was of the Multitudes that have gone before him in the same Road.</p>

                        targets="OA17511111n40-1 OA17511111-geo-42"/>Dublin</placeName>. His Father kept a Publick House, or Inn, in Cavan-street, and lived in Credit. And, had this unfortunate Youth made proper Use of the good Advice and tender Care of his Parents, he might have been a Credit to his Family, and a usefull Member of Society; but having a Tendency to Vice even from his Infancy, it was almost impossible to form his Mind to pursue any of those Instructions which tend to render Life happy and easy.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding his Father plainly perceived a Disposition, not without Difficulty to be conquered in him, yet he acted his Part, and gave him an Education much more suitable for a Gentleman, than a Person designed for Industry and hard Labour. Whilst in his juvenile Years, he made it a common Practice, instead of attending his School, to lurk after the Hostler in his Father's Stables, and took particular Delight in riding the Horses to Water. As he advanced in Age, so he contracted a Habit of Idleness and Vice, peculiar only to the most wicked and abandoned.</p>
            <p>He first begun with filching and stealing Gloves, Whips, Spurs and Handkerchiefs, from his Father's Customers; and proceeded next to try his Fortune in the Streets. His keeping very irregular Hours induced his careful Parent occasionally to make a strict Enquiry into his Manner of living; and dogging him one Night through a Crowd, found him very busy about a Gentleman's Pockets; but taking no Notice, till he was fully perswaded of the Intention of his Son, he caught him pulling his Handkerchief out of his Pocket. Struck with Shame and Confusion at the Behaviour of his Son, he directly informed the Gentleman of the whole Matter, and returned him the Handkerchief, entreating the Favour of his Company to his House. The Gentleman went with him, and in his Presence he gave his Son the most severe Horsewhip Chastisement imaginable.</p>
            <p>The Concern of the Father, and the Sorrow which the Son seemed affected and agitated with, moved the Gentleman's Compassion so far, that he suspended a Prosecution against him. However, the Father's Severity had quite a contrary Effect than appeared; for early the next Day the Son set off for the Country, not unprovided with Money, or proper Necessaries, and being a smart genteel young Fellow, he bent his Course to the County of <placeName id="OA17511111-geo-43">

            <p>Manner of Guilt; yet there was so much Deceit under that Shadow, as rendered him, at last, a Pest to civil Society. He behaved extremely well at first in this Gentleman's Family, and his Affability shortly acquir'd him the Esteem of all his Fellow Servants; but this Dawn of Honesty did not last long, for he was by and by detected in playing Pranks, which must be disagreeable to every sober Family. He thought it best to avoid the Consequence, and so, taking French Leave, he made off with all imaginable Precipitation; not forgetting to carry with him, of his Master's Moveables, a Portion for himself. And besides, he was so wicked as to make his poor Fellow-Servants also suffer the Loss of their Goods.</p>

He was not long in Town before he associated with some of his Countrymen, who led him into various Scenes of Debauchery; and, as he was excessive fond of Cards, so he thought himself perfectly unhappy when he was not engaged at a Game of Cribbage or All-fours. His Itch after Gaming was an Inlet to, and the Cause of all his Misery, and he was obliged to have Recourse to the Pawnbroker almost every Day, until he had not the second Shirt to put to his Back; and no sooner he got his Week's Wages, than it was expended either at Cards, or some other of his Nocturnal Debaucheries and Revels.
