            <p>While under Sentence, the great Evil of Theft was exposed and laid open to them, and they were earnestly exhorted to turn their Hearts, and fervently to implore the Favour, the Forgiveness, and the Protection of an all-merciful, omnipotent, all-gracious God, who will, when the Wicked turneth away from the Wickedness he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, save their Souls alive. When the Body is but Dust, the never dying Soul still exists, and immediately Experiences such endless Torment, or such eternal Happiness, as is beyond the Power of Man to describe, surely then, no Time should be lost, no Pains should be spared to endeavour the saving that precious Part, for what can a Man give in exchange for his Soul.</p>

            <p>This Crime of robbing and stripping young Children, is justly punish'd with the greatest Severity, for how often has it been attended with the most dismal Consequences, a favourite Child being in this manner taken away, has perhaps been the Loss of a Parents Senses or Life. Other Times perhaps the Child by being left all Night almost naked by these barbarous Wretches in the Fields, has lost its Life.</p>

One of them said to me, Pho! Pho! you foolish Girl, don't meddle with him, for as you go often up and down the Road, you may be murdered; and another who was in Company said, what Business have you with Cook? I reply'd, shall a Man escape that has been guilty of so many Robberies, and of Murder too? No, indeed, he shall not, since there is such an Opportunity of taking him. I then went into the Market, thinking to get one to go along with me. There I saw one of my Master's Men, I told him that I had dodg'd Cook into an Alehouse, and if he would go along with me, he and I could take him. His Answer was, he could not stay.

Yet again I reflected, 'tis not me who takes away his Life, 'tis the Law of the Land, and I do not do Justice to my Country, if I do not endeavour to take him, besides, he will have by far the Advantage of those poor sinful Souls, who are robb'd and murder'd, and sent out of the World with all their Sins to answer for, because he will have Time to repent, whereas they had none. Thus were my Thoughts in Confusion, 'till I came to Mr. Atterbury's the Butcher.

Mr. Haines went directly to the House, and I went in immediately after, tho' before I came in, Mr. Haines had seized him, and ask'd me, if that was the Man, I told him Yes, that was the very Man Cook ask'd him, what he wanted with him? Mr. Haines said, I want to search you; search me if you will, says he, for I have nothing about me. By this Time Mr. Atterbury came in, when the Constable was searching his Left-side Pockets, but when he came to search his Right, he got up and made some Resistance, and said he should not search him. Mr. Haines replied, I insist on searching you, for I am charg'd with you as a Highwayman. Cook said again, he should not search him, standing up all the Time, Mr. Atterbury, who had a Broom in his Hand, held it up, and said, D-n your Blood! if you don't submit, I'll knock you down; be civil, and you shall be civilly us'd; then he suffer'd himself to be search'd, and they found on him five Watches, a green Purse with nine Guineas and a half, and 2 s. 6 d. in Silver, a Pocket-piece of an old Date, three Seals, a piece of a Silver hilted Sword, and some Pieces of Silver belonging to the Tops of Whips, the Name Pennyman, after he had search'd and found no Arms about him, I insisted on his taking him into Custody, till we could get farther Information from Stratford, for I was sure he was the very Man, and at the same Time I desired Mr. Taylor to keep his Doors fast and let in none but those he knew, for tho' he had no Arms, yet as he had sent a Letter, and it was reported when the Barber was kill'd, that there was a whole Gang of 'em, there might come some to his Assistance.</p>
            <p>In the mean while I went to Justice Chandler's to wait till they could bring him thither, which was in about half an Hour, and Mr. Haines after telling the Justice the manner of my coming to him, and giving him Charge of Cook, produc'd the Watches which he had taken upon him, and which the Justice look'd carefully over, and examin'd the No. and Maker's Names, asking Cook how he came by 'em, who reply'd he was a Gentleman's Son who liv'd at <placeName id="OA17410916-geo-66">

            <p>Whilst I was here it came in my Head to go in Pursuit of the Constable who had got my Watch and Pistols, since the Time of my being taken, who I had such a Spite and Hatred against, that I was determined if ever I met him to have his Life; but Providence directed to the contrary, for I never could hear what was become of him.</p>
            <p>Going to Sea I thought a Hardship, especially for a Gentleman as I then thought I was entituled to by my Profession, and therefore resolved to continue as such, and revenge the Death of my poor Man Will, for whom I had a very great Regard and Esteem, not only from his Valour and Courage in the Profession of a Gentleman Collector, but for his civil Behaviour and good Nature, and had he not depended so much upon his Strength, his Reign might have been longer.</p>
            <p>When upon the Road, he instead of clapping a Pistol to a Man's Breast, would often take a Man by the Collar, and once as he stopt a Gentleman's Servant near Burntwood upon his Resistance seeing no Pistol, they both tumbled from their Horses into a great Ditch, I stood looking on some Time, till the Gentleman's Servant was too many for Will, I came up and presented a Pistol, which soon ended the Dispute, from whom we took a Basket, wherein was a Pound or thereabouts of Hyson Tea, Sugar and Plumbs, &amp;c. and several Pounds of Starch, this was a Present for a Lady, as several other Things had been before, that I had robb'd People of, all which she was thankful for, and willing to take, had there been a thousand Times as much, notwithstanding she well knew how I came by them.</p>

            <p>The next Morning several setting out from that Inn for London, who had lain there, and at private Houses in the Town, among whom was a Gentleman I had a great Suspicion was my bitter Enemy, Mawley. I let the Coach go on about half an Hour, I then call'd for my Horse, after paying my Reckoning, the Landlord bidding me a good Morning, and a safe arrival in Town, hoping I should escape the noted Cook and his Gang, I thanked him, and set out after my prey, the Stage-Coach, wherein was gone the very Antidote of my Soul; I persued with a Resolution, not only to shoot the Man I suspected, but for a certainty all in the Coach, when I came up with them, my Soul was so full of Envy, Hatred and Malice against him, that I scarce could bid the Coachman stop without blowing his Brains out; when I came to the Door of the Coach, I demanded which was Capt. Mawley, who had shot my Companion, and endeavour'd the same to me, I told them, they who were not He, had better discover which he was, otherwise I would destroy them all; when a beautiful young Lady who was in the Coach, fell upon her Knees, imploring my Mercy, and protesting he was not there, as did all the rest the same; this instantly excited my Compassion, and moved me to Pity. As I always had, and professed a great Veneration for the Fair-Sex, I put up my Pistol, desiring the Gentlemen to be speedy in giving me their Money, &amp;c. which they did to the amount of above 30 l. all I demanded of the Fair-one, was a kind Salute, which she readily complied with, with which I took my Leave, telling the Gentlemen if Capt.

            <p>The Miscarriage in this Undertaking I must confess, as my unhappy Companion Hall has often since charged me with, was in a great Measure owing to my ill Conduct in getting drunk every Day, and not being so close and secret in the Affair as I ought to have been in a Matter of such Consequence.

            <p>12 o'Clock, Sunday Night.</p>
            <p>My Dear,</p>
            <p>' I Am very sorry we could not have the Liberty of a little Time by ourselves, when ' you came to take your Leave of me; if we ' had, I should have thought of many more Things ' to have said to you than I did; but then I fear ' it would have caused more Grief at our parting. ' I am greatly concerned, that I am obliged to ' leave you and my Child, and much more in such ' a Manner, as to give the World Room to reflect ' upon you on my Account, though none but the ' Ignorant will, but rather pity your Misfortunes, ' as being fully satisfy'd of your Innocency in all ' Respects, relating to the Crime for which I am ' in a few Hours to suffer.</p>
            <p>' I now heartily wish, not only for my own ' Sake, but the injur'd Persons, yours, and my ' Child's, that I was as innocent as you are, but ' I freely own, I am not, nor possibly can be in ' this World; yet I humbly hope, and fully trust, ' through God's great Mercy, and the Merits of ' my Blessed Saviour Jesus Christ, to be happy in ' the next.</p>
            <p>' After I parted with you, I received the Holy ' Sacrament comfortably which Mr. Broughton was ' so good as to administer to me, who has also several Times before taken a great deal of Pains, ' to instruct me, and so has some others of his Acquaintance, by whose Assistance, and my own ' Endeavours, I hope God will pardon all my Sins ' for Christ's Sake, and admit me into his heavenly ' Kingdom.</p>
            <p>' My Dear, some of my latest Prayers will be ' to God to direct and prosper you and my Child ' in all good Ways, so long as he pleases to let you ' live here on Earth, that afterwards he may receive you both to his Mercies to all Eternity. I ' hope I shall willingly submit to my Fate, and die ' in Peace with all Men. This is now all the ' Comfort I can give you in this World, who living was, and dying I hope to remain,</p>
            <p>Your loving and most affectionate Husband,</p>
