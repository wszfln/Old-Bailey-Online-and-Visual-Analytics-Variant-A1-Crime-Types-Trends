            <p>When I had laid before him the exceeding Sinfulness of his Crime, and asked him, How he came to do it? His own Expression was,</p>
            <p>"The Devil was in me." As indeed nothing but the Instigations of that wicked One could prompt a Man to commit this, or any other such atrocious Crime.</p>
            <p>When I asked him, If there had been any Grudging, or Ill-will between Pit, the deceased, and him? He declared, as he was about to leave the World, that Bickerings, and slight Words would sometimes happen between them, but that they never had any Quarrel, which went so far as to cause them to be at Enmity, or to bear Malice.</p>
            <p>A very odd Circumstance you'll observe, as I give you Hullock's Relation of what passed in Talk between the two Bedfellows, e'er they slept that Night, in which this execrable Murder was committed. Pit, he says, came, and knocked at the Door between 12 and 1 o'Clock, on a Sunday Night; that he got out of Bed, went down in his Shirt, and let him in. Pit went up Stairs directly, and got into Bed. By and bye, after his Business was done in the Cellar, Hullock went up Stairs into the Garret to Bed to him. Pit asked Hullock, as they were a-bed together, whether he had been Abroad that Day? To which, when the latter's Reply was, He had not; the former (Pit) immediately said,</p>
            <p>"Some</p>
            <p>"cruel, wicked, and bloody Thing</p>
            <p>"would be done that Night." I don't find any Thing particular was mentioned, the Expressions was in general Terms. Hullock says, he took no Notice then of what Pit said to him, but bid him go to sleep, and not trouble his Head with odd Fancies; for the best Way was to go to sleep, and that was what they went to Bed for.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174707310005"/>
            <p>This he says, and declares upon his dying Word to be the true Purport of what passed between them e'er they fell asleep, and very much laments that he should so give Wayto those Evils, which the Craft and Subtilty of the Devil worked in him, as to have Reason to remember it all the Days of his Breath. For, as Pit had said, so unhappily indeed for the both Bedfellows, it came to pass, the one was immediately destroyed, and cut off in the Midst of his Sins; the other by acting this bloody Scene, has brought himself to a shameful and ignorninious End, to lose his Life by hanging like a Dog: Afterwards his Body to be exposed in open Air, debarred a decent Burial; which the Antients looked upon as the greatest Unhappiness that could attend their Exit from this World, and imagined the Soul never to be at Rest, till funeral Obsequies were performed for the Body. Besides which, there is the great Danger he is in with respect to the future Judgment, unless the Mercies of God prove infinitely greater than his Merits.</p>
            <p>Pit's Saying then, as it fell out, was somewhat remarkable; tho', by the bye, I don't pretend to say that any Consequence is particularly to be drawn from it. However, after they had slept awhile, as Hullock informs me, he awoke suddenly, and found Pit was lying cross his Stomach. Upon which, Passion, which is Madness and the Devil, got the Mastery of him; and taking to him the Instrument, that deadly Weapon (of which he had been Owner a long while) with which he first knocked him down, striking him on the Head, and then, in a most barbarous Manner, perpetrated the Sin of Murder, and wilfully killed not only his Neighbour, but Chamber-Fellow, by giving him thirteen or fourteen Wounds or Stabs. Against which, he appears now to be very sensible, that not the Laws of his Country only, but the Laws of the Author of all Beings hath provided, that he who sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed.</p>
            <p>He says, after he had committed the Fact, and he saw the Cruelty he had been guilty of, and reflected upon what he had done to the little Boy and his Master, he was very much shocked at it in himself, and from that Time expected none other than the Fate he has now suffered.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174707310006"/>
            <p>When I asked him again, how he could be guilty of a Murder so shocking to human Nature? He gives no other Account of himself than as above, only varies a little in Terms, that, as well as he can remember, his Passion was so very powerful, and hurried him on to that Degree, that he was in a manner deprived of his Senses, and forsome considerable Time after he had acted this bloody Scene, (for which I refer the Reader to the Sessions Papers) he cou'd neither hear, nor speak, and was like one bereft of all Sense of unguarded Moments. Oh! the fatal Effects! Oh! the detestable Consequences of unbridled Wilfulness! How dangerous is the Situation of that Man, who lets loose the Reins of Government to the Passions, and suffers them to get the Dominion over him. Therefore, Hoc scitum fit alienis periculum facere, to take warning by others, shou'd have its due Weight on the Mind of Man.</p>
            <p>This is what I gathered from him in the Course of our private Conversation, but not satisfied with this Account, he desired me to let him have Pen and Ink, that he might have the Liberty to write a Sort of History of his Life, to be delivered to the World, that others might avoid those evil Courses to which he gave too much Way, left they come into these melancholy Circumstances, which will put an End to Life. The following Account therefore he wrote himself in the Cells of Newgate, and delivered to me the Day before his Execution, viz.</p>

Mr. Birkill of Buenos-Ayres's Coffee-House in the Minories was my Fellow-Apprentice, till my Master died, which I think was March following. Then I went to Mr. Goodby next Door, and he and I not agreeing about Cloaths, I went to Mr. Clarkson in St. James's-Street, where I was for about five Months. While in this Service, a Fellow-Servant of mine being riper than I was, we used to look out for a Woman after we had done Work of a Night. And so we went on till I found out what sort of a Bargain my Father had made with my Master about me: Which was, I was to serve all the Time over again, that I had served with my former Master, and besides, my Father was to find me in Cloaths all the 7 Years, my new Master not being a Freeman of the City neither.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174707310007"/>
            <p>These Things I did not approve of, for besides having no Title to a Freedom of the City after my Servitude, I was likely to go without Cloaths during my Service. For I was sensible, my Father having so large a Family, he cou'd not do it. So I told my Master Clarkson, that I was determined to leave him. He asked me the Reason why, and I told him, as I have related above. Upon which, says he, you shan't have your Things away, till I see your Father, for we have made a Bargain about you. I understand you have, says I, Sir, but I will not stand to it, for my Father has nothing to do with me, but the Executors of my Master are the People that must do it, if any be made for me.</p>
            <p>Then he said, Sam, I respect you very well, don't leave me, and proposed other Things to me, which I wou'd not agree to, and so left him.</p>

            <p>My Father dying soon after I went there, and my eldest Brothere living Journeyman at a Stationer's-Shop in Bishopsgate-Street within, I began to be very uneasy about my Mother, and the other Children. But God provided for them, for what with her own Labour and Industry, and the Blessing of God, they lived tolerably well in Life. And by my own Labour I was enabled to help them, which I did as far I cou'd, not having Cloaths to provide for myself, my Master finding them for me; and besides I got a pretty many Pence by lighting Gentlemen Home, that used to frequent our House. Then he goes on, and puts down a Number of incidents too tedious to mention; and then proceeds.</p>
            <p>In my Apprenticeship, I was used to take Delight in the Female Sex, in going Abroad with them. I have too often spent the Lord's Day, rather than go to Church. Some of those I was acquainted with lived in the Mint, and they wanted me to rob my Master if I cou'd lay Hands conveniently on Plate, or any thing else worth while.</p>
            <p>To whom I answered,</p>
            <p>"What</p>
            <p>"must I do with the Goods when</p>
            <p>"I have got them?" This seems to shew the Temper of the Man, and it savours rather of Fear of Discovery, than Want of Inclination so to do.</p>
            <p>Their Answer was,</p>
            <p>"Bring</p>
            <p>"them to us, and we know what</p>
            <p>"to do with them." However, I forsook this Company, though it was not long e'er I became acquainted with, and knew others of the same Stamp, who would have persuaded me to the same, or such like Crimes, but I resolved to forsake their Society, and did leave them for some Time.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174707310008"/>
            <p>At this Time I took it into my Head to stay at Home with the Servants of my Master's House, which displeased my Master and Mistress greatly; insomuch that they gave themselves a deal of Trouble to talk to me. But I being too fond of the Sex to listen to any Body's Advice, took no Notice of what they said, at least it made no Impression.</p>
            <p>For immediately upon that I went over Tower-Hill that Night, where I met a Woman for my Purpose, and being concern'd with her, she gave me the Foul Disease, of which I took proper Care in Time.</p>
            <p>However our Foreman wrote to my Master then at Bath, who having receiv'd an Account of my Behaviour, immediately ordered me to be turned away.</p>
            <p>But I made a great Hurry about it, and the Alderman's Beadle was sent for to keep Peace, for fear of my being Angry, and abusing him that sent my Master Word of what I had done, and what had happen'd, so he seems always to have been a passionate and vicious Fellow.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless having been out of my Time about a Year and a half, and being hired to work by the Year, I insisted on having a Months' Warning.</p>
            <p>In that Time I sent to my Master, who returned me for Answer, that I might stay as long as I pleased. But when the Month was up, I packed up my Alls, and away I went, and fixed on a Lodging where I became first acquainted with my Wife that now is, with whom I had lived some Years, and had two Children, tho' not yet married.</p>
            <p>She being a very fractious and turbulent Woman, one Day getting a Warrant for me, had me before Sir <persName id="OA17470731n49-1">

The former Woman I did not see for five Years and a half, in which Time I had been in the Marshalsea Prison, and when I came out I turned off the latter, and so got rid of them both for some Time.</p>
            <p>Now I lived single, and by myself again, not troubling my Head about either of them, nor thinking to hear of them more. But at length the Woman I was first acquainted, and knew, came teazing me again, and then we agreed to be married.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174707310009"/>
            <p>Accordingly our Banns were ask'd at St. Catherine's by the Tower, and we were really married.</p>
            <p>On the Monday following, we began to be as much at Variance as ever, and to live like Cat and Dog. I found she wou'd take to her old Courses. For no sooner had we dined that Day at a Publick House upon six fine Rabbits, (at eating which were present six Old Women besides of her Acquaintance) than she began her old Tricks of abusing; and calling me Name, and would not stay with me that Night, but went Home with her Mother, as she call'd a Woman in the Company. But I soon fetch'd her to my Lodgings; beginning again to cohabit, Children came on, and I was forced to take a little House, and lived a troublesome Life with her unsettled Temper, that was never easy.</p>
            <p>At last she persuaded me to put out the Children, which done she went abroad to learn Slop-work about six Weeks, and then was tired.</p>
            <p>I went also to Work to Mr. Pickfatt's, but before this had borrowed two Guineas of him. During my being with him, he advised me to get into the Office of Ordnance to Work, for which I got a Warrant sign'd, tho' I never went to Work.</p>
            <p>One Evening I came Home, and was eating my Supper, when a Man came to the Door, and said, here's somebody in the House that has picked my Pocket, and I will see him.</p>
            <p>He knocked as if he wou'd knock the Door down; upon which I threw down a Cafe Knife I had in my Hand, and took up a little Fire-Shovel, and went to open the Door. When a Man forced in, and I stroke at him with the Shovel, and cut him on the Side of the Head; then came in another, and I found they were Bailiffs, for they carried me to Goal at Mr. Pickfatt's Suit, and there I staid a long Time.</p>
            <p>While I was there, he came one Morning, and enquired for me, and I went down to him, and he ask'd me, if I wou'd go Home with him. I desired him to say quickly what he had to say. Why in such a Hurry, Sam, says he? I told him, I was roasting a Breast of Mutton, and cou'd not stay, Why, says he, you live here better than I do at Home. And so I did, for at that that Time I had two Women came to the Prison to me, who took a great deal of Care of me.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174707310010"/>
            <p>However, I agreed to go Home with Mr. Pickfatt; and then the two Guineas was come, Chargesand all, to five Pounds, sixteen Shillings, and I was to work with him, and pay so much a Week. My Wife, and Children were now upon the Parish.</p>
            <p>I staid with him some Time, till he used to lock me out of Doors, and stop too much of my Wages at a Time, which I bore with a great deal of Patience, but resolved to leave him. At this Time my Wife and three Children were all at once sick, but it pleased God to take away two of them.</p>
            <p>At last Mr. Jones came to me, and seeing me in the Dumps, said, as Mr. Pickfatt did not use me well, he wou'd advise me to come and work with him. Accordingly I did on Monday the 25th of April, 1743, and left Mr. Pickfatt after Eight Years Service, whom I never since saw but once, and then he was after me with Bailiffs, as if I had been the greatest Thief in the World.</p>
            <p>With Mr. Jones I continued, but lived an uneasy Life with some I had to do with, till the unhappy and barbarous Murder was by me committed, as before related.</p>

            <p>For, she says, since that unhappy Day, she has led a loose and debauched Course of Life; but being urged to particularize, she was always silent and sullen. As to the Fact for which she was convicted, she confesses her Guilt with all its aggravating Circumstances; which are very wicked, and unbecoming one Christian to another, and one of her own Sex.</p>
            <p>It appears from her own Mouth, that she had known Ryley for some considerable Time, and, no doubt, many a dirty Trick have they committed together, though this was the first Time of their being found out.</p>
            <p>She accuses him of having led her on to Wickedness, especially to the Commission of this Fact; though she said, she did not chuse to upbraid him. But particularly she says, the Day that Ryley was cleared at the Sessions, before that of their Conviction, she was at the Old Bailey, and seeing him come out, they presently joined, and went away to rejoice upon his Deliverance. They went, she owns, and got fuddled together, and returning towards home in the Evening, fell upon a Booty, which cost them dear, though they made no Advantage of it.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutrix met, and asked them her Way Home, and they directed her to the wicked Place, where they knew they might, without present Danger, put in Practice their evil Designs against her. They led the Stranger out of the Way, and stripped her of all her Cloaths, and abused her. And beating the poor Woman in a barbarous Manner, who made no Resistance, they at last left her Comfortless, in a forlorn and desolate Place, naked, and in Danger of her Life.</p>
            <p>Before they could dispose of the Cloaths, she says, she was taken into Custody, and Ryley not long after; so the Day she thought to have rejoiced, proved a Day of Sorrow to her all her succeeding Days.</p>

He was a Lad of a stubborn, self-willed Temper, was very early initiated into evil Courses, and grew an Adept by times, and having been trained up without any manner of Education, was unhappily ignorant of every thing he ought to have been acquainted with: So that Nature took her own Course, evidenced early Marks of Depravity, and the Bent of his Inclination to Evil discovered itself, almost as soon as she began to exert her Faculties. For he says, when he was about nine or ten Years of Age, he, and one <persName id="OA17470731n72-2">

            <p>But, soon growing weary of such trifling Employ, they ventured further, and beginning a new Trade, became <rs id="OA17470731-occupation-21" type="occupation">Pick-Pocket</rs>

By which slight of Hand, when he had gotten any Money, he was never easy, till he got to Gaming, which practice was attended with a much worse, for profane Cursing and Swearing was as sure a Consequence, as any Effect is of its Cause.</p>
            <p>When ill Fortune had robbed him of these Acquisitions, away goes he into the Streets, Steals, and Pilfers every thing he cou'd lay his Hands on; scarce as yet having Sense enough to know, that discovery in these Practices wou'd be of ill Consequence to him.</p>
            <p>He says further, that he was used to lye from Home of Nights, to Game on Sundays, when he had any Money, and every other way did he break the Sabbath, playing at Cards, profanely and profligately blaspheming God's holy Name.</p>
            <p>And when his Father was in Liquor, he wou'd pick his Pockets, as sure as he had any thing in them. On Sunday Nights particularly he always went to Work, thinking, when People were best dress'd,</p>
            <p>'twas likely to meet with the greatest Success.</p>
            <p>Thus he led his Life for many Months, if not some Years; till seeing other Boys taken up, and punished, he thought it might be his turn next, so took it into his Head, to leave off, which he did for awhile; when he went and hired himself to a <rs id="OA17470731-occupation-22" type="occupation">Carman</rs>

In this Service having the Misfortune to break his Leg, he was put into an Hospital, and after receiving the Benefit of a Cure there, was put into a <rs id="OA17470731-occupation-23" type="occupation">Workhouse</rs>

            <p>At length, having stolen a Shewglass of Buckles, and two Gallon Pots, he was caught, and took his Tryal at the Old Bailey, and for that Time escaped, being cleared by the Court.</p>
            <p>The very same Day, not at all dismayed, away he goes to May-Fair, which happened to be at that Time: He had no great Success, though his Designs were to have stolen any Thing he could come by conveniently. He got enough however to make him and his Companion drunk, and returning homewards at Night, a Thirst after more induced them to commit the Fact for which he suffers.</p>
            <p>He says, Swearing and blasphemous Expressions was a Crime to which he was particularly addicted, for which, and all other Offences against God, he declares himself heartily sorry, and is instructed humbly to Hope, that upon his sincere Repentance and Trust in the Merits of Christ, God will forgive him, and he desires all Christian People to pray for his departing Soul, that God will have Mercy upon him.</p>

Hurlock appeared, as he always did, with a gloomy Look, and downcast Eyes, and remained in Silence. They were attentive during the Time of Prayer, and repeated with me such Parts, as I directed them. Having recommended them to God, they were turned off, calling on Him to receive their Souls, and had a very hard Passage out of this Life.</p>
