That, To the just and upright Man He will give Eternal Life: But, To the wicked disobedient Man Eternal Misery. They were desired to think Seriously on their approaching End, and to resolve to repent fervently of their former Sins, that they might at the last Day, be among the Number of those to whom our blessed Lord and Saviour shall Say, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom, &amp;c. They were pressingly urged not to lose those few precious Moments they had left, but incessantly to cry up to God for Forgiveness.</p>

            <p>THE next Robbery they committed, was upon a Carpenter belonging to Chelsea, whom they met going home, about nine o'Clock at Night; 'twas very dark, they could but just perceive him coming along; they made up to him, and demanded his Money, and Watch; which he not readily giving, saying he was only a poor Carpenter; they knock'd him down with a Stick; and he tumbled into a Ditch; they took from him a Watch, with an enamel'd Dial plate, (which they afterwards pawn'd in Wild-Street) and about Half a Crown in Money, and his Hat and Wig.</p>
            <p>'TIS very remarkable, that a Gentleman's Servant, one Saunders, was the very next Day taken up for this Robbery, carried before a Justice of Peace, sworn positively too by the Prosecutor, sent to Newgate, and was try'd at the <placeName id="OA17441005-geo-37">

            <p>&#8220; him was in the House, he knew him by his &#8220; Voice, and that when he came into the Room &#8220; where he was, he called him by his Name, &#8220; and said, How could you serve me so, when I &#8220; have given you many a Meal's Meat. The &#8220; Prisoner in his Defence denied the Fact, and &#8220; called several Persons to his Character, who &#8220; all gave him a very good one, and he likewise &#8220; prov'd where he was till near Ten o'Clock &#8220; that Night, (the Robbery being committed at &#8220; Nine) and he was acquitted.&#8221; The Whole therefore that we would infer from hence, is, that we would advise all Persons to be extremely cautious how they swear to the Identity of a Person in the Case of Life and Death; what Recompence, what Retaliation can be made, when a Man is no more? And what Remorse, what Stings must be on that Man's Conscience? when the Truth appears, that by his Means an innocent Life is taken away. Nor is this all, for tho' in the present Case, the innocent unhappy Man preserved his Life, yet his Character must severely have suffered; for true it is, tho' sorry we are to say it, that the Generality of the World are more fond of Censure, than of Praise. On the other Hand, we would not be understood to mean, that Rogues should escape their just Deserts; no, on the contrary, let every one exert himself, let every Man lend an helping Hand, and we should soon see an End put to those audacious, impudent, villainous Attempts, that are every Night made in this City and Suburbs.</p>
            <p>BUT this is a Digression, for which we ask the Reader's Pardon, and shall proceed in our Narrative.</p>
            <p>AFTER they had committed this Robbery, they did nothing else that Night, but went Home to their Lodging in <placeName id="OA17441005-geo-42">Covent Garden</placeName>.</p>

The other Gentleman was in the mean Time scuffling with Christopher, but the Rogues soon overpower'd them, and took from one of them a Watch, some Silver, and his Sword; and from the other, a Watch with a Triangle Chrystal Seal, set in Gold, a Guinea, and his Sword: Finding by their Tongues that they were Irish Gentlemen, they were sorry they attack'd them; but as they had begun, they must go thro', tho' it saved one of the Gentlemen his Gold Lac'd Waistcoat, which they would certainly have taken, had they not been their Countrymen. The Gentlemen begged very hard for their Swords, one of which, a Mourning Sword, Patrick returned, but his Companion Christopher would not return the other, nor the Seal, which the Gentlemen likewise begged for.</p>
            <p>N. B. The Gentlemen have been with the Evidence in New-Prison, who told them where all their Things were pawn'd, which they have since got again.</p>

All this Time Christopher and the other Man were not idle Spectators, but were thumping each other to some Tune; sometimes up, sometimes down; however, Patrick and his Companion were at length Conquerors, and when they had overpowered them, they took from them a Bag, in which was two Pair of Stays, a Child's Pair and a Woman's Pair, some Money, their Hats and their Wigs.

Christopher, while Patrick was engaging the Man, cowardly knock'd down the Woman, beat and abused her very much, for which Patrick severely reprimanded him.</p>

Thieves! it alarm'd Christopher so much, that he hid himself in the Fields all Night, but Patrick went Home.</p>
            <p>SOMETIME after this they robbed a Drawer in the Five-Fields, coming from <placeName id="OA17441005-geo-55">

            <p>ABOUT the Beginning of July last, they met an old Gentleman in <placeName id="OA17441005-geo-56">

[It seems the poor Gentleman feels the Effects of that Blow to this Day.] They took from him about four or five Shillings in Money, a Hat and Wig, his Silver Shoe, Knee, and Stock Buckles, and his Pocket Book, in which there were several Notes and Bills, all of which (as they did not know the Use or Value of them) they burnt. Christopher would likewise have taken his Coat, but Patrick prevented him; the old Gentleman begged for his Hat, or his Handkerchief, to put over his Head, but they would give him neither; he then got from them, and ran, and made a great Noise of Thieves! Thieves! and they made off.</p>
            <p>IN the same Fields, some few Nights after, they met two Gentlemen belonging to the Duke of Grafton, with whom they had a very smart Engagement; for on their presenting a Pistol to each of them, bidding them Stand and deliver,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174410050011"/>
            <p>they very fairly knock'd 'em both down; they rose again, and Christopher was knock'd down a second Time; they then presented their Pistols, determining to shoot, but missed Fire; at length Patrick's Pistol went off, close by the Gentleman's Ear, which surpriz'd him, and at the same Instant he knock'd him down with the Butt End thereof, and the Gentleman bled very much, and gave him his Money. Christopher was during this Time engaging with the other Gentleman, who had ran some little Distance, where Christopher followed him, knock'd him down into a Ditch, beat him when he was there, and took from him a Tortoiseshell Watch and a Cane, and left him. By this Time Patrick had done with his Man, and was looking about for his Hat and Wig, which had fallen off in the Scuffle, and Christopher came up to him, and they were going off, when they heard a Noise behind them; turning about to see what it was, they found that the Gentleman whom Christopher had left in the Ditch, had got up to his Companion, and taking him for one of the Robbers, seized him, and was laying on with his Fists most violently, till on his roaring out, his Friend discovered his Mistake, and most heartily asked his Pardon. This occasioned our two Rogues a hearty Laugh, and they made off.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Evening they met a Man whom they supposed to be a Taylor, in <placeName id="OA17441005-geo-57">

Why by stopping a Coach, wherein there was only an elderly Gentleman who lived at Hampstead, and he had only two Servants with him, an old Coachman, and an old Footman. Patrick still would not understand him, but exclaimed much against him, and said 'twas a dangerous and a wicked Way of getting Money. Mackavoy finding he could make nothing of him, was resolved to try his Partner Christopher, with whom he had better Success, for he was not long before he consented to take him in, and they both together applied to Patrick, who seemed, and was indeed very angry with Christopher for taking any body else in; when they had agreed to stand by and support each other by themselves, but now, since he had laid himself open to Mackavoy, 'twas too late to go back, and he gave his Consent, tho' with Reluctance, and they went out all three together that Night, and several Nights after, but met with no Success.</p>

From them they took a Silver Watch, a Tortoiseshell Watch, two Mourning Rings, and some Money. The fourth ran away.</p>
            <p>GOING a little farther, after they had robbed the above Gentlemen, they met a Man, to whom they gave the usual Salutation, D - n you, stand and deliver! He said he was only a Journeyman Baker, and that he had not received his Wages: But they took some Money from him, his Hat and his Wig, and a Parcel of Leaden Pieces, which they threw away.

            <p>THE same Night, and near the same Place, they endeavoured to stop three Gentlemen on Horseback, two of whom rode away, and cry'd out loudly, Thieves! Thieves! Thieves! Mackavoy snapp'd his Pistol after them, but it missed Fire: They took about four or five Shillings from the other Gentleman, and went Home, and did no more that Night.</p>
            <p>THE Tuesday following they proposed going out again, but Mackavoy thinking Patrick was drunk, refused to go, and Christopher and Patrick went by themselves. In Islington Fields they met a Man and a Woman, the Man said he was a Porter; they took from him a Coat with Silver Buttons, his Hat and Wig, and his Stock with a Silver Clasp. Patrick had no Thoughts of taking his Coat, but Christopher says, D - n ye, ye Dog, you must take his Coat, for the Buttons are Silver. From the Woman they took a Scarlet Cloak, a Straw Hat, her Silver Shoe Buckles, and four Rings, three Plain, one with a Stone in it; one of the Rings being pretty hard to come off, Christopher put the Woman's Finger in his Mouth, and drew it off with his Teeth.</p>

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174410050013"/>
            <p>THE next Day, about 3 or 4 in the Afternoon, Christopher, Patrick, and Mackavoy, went out together, (Ryley not yet having bought his Fire-Arms, staid behind) they all three went to Hackney Marsh, intending to bath themselves in the River, 'till they thought it was time for the Gentry to be coming from Ruckholt House; finding the Water cold, they soon left it, and went to Temple-Mills, drank some Beer, and Drams, then came over the Bridge, walk'd up and down Hackney River 'till near dark, and then they thought 'twas Time to begin their Work; accordingly they disguis'd themselves, Mackavoy turn'd his Coat inside outwards, and they all three put on Woollen Caps, and Handkerchiefs, went to the Foot of the Bridge, to see if there was any Watch; found the Coast clear, came back, saw two Men, who suspecting what they were, ran away: They heard a Coach coming from Hackney, which prov'd to be Mr. Alderman Heathcote's; Patrick stept forward, to see if there was any Danger from Attendants, it being the first Coach they ever stopt; found there was none, then gave the Word &#8225;, and went up to the Coachman, and presenting his Pistol, said D - n you, Stop, or I'll blow your Brains out! and the Coachman stopt. Mackavoy went to the Coach Door, put in his Pistol, and demanded the Alderman's Money and Watch; the Alderman said, Take away your Pistol, and I'll give you what I have: and he gave him his Gold Watch, with a Gold Chain, and two Seals, set in Gold, two Guineas and a half, and some Silver, his Mourning Sword and Belt; they also made him come out of his Coach, and took his Hat, and his Stock and Stock-Buckle; the Alderman desired they would return his Stock and Buckle; but they refused, and Christopher would have taken his Coat and Tye Wig, but Patrick prevented him; at which, Christopher was afterwards very angry, because he design'd them for Ryley's wear, (to whom he gave the Alderman's Sword and Belt, being determined to equip him like a Gentleman.)</p>
            <p>AFTER Mackavoy had taken those Things from the Alderman, he went to the Coachman, and demanded his Watch, which the Coachman not being very ready to part with, the Alderman said, Coachman, if you have one, give it him, and I will satisfy you. Patrick seeing Mackavoy not proceed to take the Coachman's Money, he got up on the Coach Wheel, and took some Silver from him. Patrick then went to the Footman, and ordered him to come down, and deliver his Watch and Money; he said, he had no Watch, and not coming down as he was bid, Patrick gave him a Blow with his Hanger, and cut his Coat, and then jumped up, search'd his Breeches, found he had no Watch, and took from him some Silver. Patrick went a second Time up to the Alderman, and demanded his Rings, and his Watch; the Alderman said, he had before given his Watch to the other Gentleman, meaning Mackavoy, and upon his Honour, he had no Rings; they then made off. 'Tis observable, that all the while this Robbery was committing, which was about 9 o'Clock at Night, not a single Person came by.</p>
            <p>WE cannot help taking Notice here, that tho' these Rogues would stand by and support each other in robbing Mankind, yet they could not be honest to themselves, for they were as ready to cheat each his Companion, on any Occasion that offer'd, as they were to rob a Stranger, which plainly appears by Mackavoy's Behaviour, after they had robb'd the Alderman; for being got a little Distance, they began to compare Notes, it being a Moon-light Night, and see what they had got. Mackavoy produced the Cole, but intended to sink the Watch: Patrick (who had been told by the Alderman, that he gave Mackavoy his Watch) says, what did'nt ye take the Gentleman's Watch? Mackavoy protested No! and insisted on it strongly; on which very high Words arose, and Christopher and Patrick were preparing to force him to go back, and overtake the Alderman's Coach, in order to prove him a Villain to his Companions, which they look'd on to be a </p>
            <p>&#8225; They had different Words between themselves, which were generally Irish; the Word Patrick now made use of, as near as it can be pronounced, was, Cornahasea, the meaning of which is, make 'em Stand.</p>

            <p>Crime of the first Magnitude, and he produced it, and Christopher snatch'd it out of his Hand.</p>

They agreed to divide, and each Man to receive his Share, and seem'd to be good Friends again, and while Ryley was gone down Stairs, Christopher promised to stand by Patrick, and never deceive him more, but go with him any where; and laid the whole Blame of his attempting to leave him, upon Ryley.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Ryley was below Stairs, telling the Woman of the House, that his Fellow-traveller was catch'd, above Stairs by a Man to whom he owed some Money, who would throw him into Goal, unless she would be so kind to assist him in making his Escape. She promised she would, and Ryley went up Stairs; after some Talk together, Christopher ask'd Patrick leave to go down to the Necessary House, which Patrick granted; and when he came down, the Woman of the House acquainted him with what Riley had said, and shewed him how to get into the Lane out of the Cellar; accordingly Christopher got out, and went away, and neither he, nor the Booty was ever more seen by any of his Companions.</p>
            <p>PATRICK and Riley having waited a good while, and Christopher not coming up, Patrick began to suspect he was trick'd again, and taking out his Pistol, swore he would blow out Riley's Brains, if he did not tell him where he was gone: Riley protested he did not know, but that he would help to seek him, and would take on with him, and go together on all Occasions; they went out, and was the whole Day seeking for Christopher, but to no Purpose, he had got clean off, and they never saw him more.</p>
            <p>THEY then went to Mackavoy, and Riley own'd his Contrivance to get Christopher away, designing to have gone with him: But since he had served him thus, he would stand by Patrick and Mackavoy, and they three only, would for the future be concern'd together.</p>
            <p>THE Saturday Night following, they all three went to Stepney-Fields, in Expectation of some Booty; but was met by five or six of the same Profession: Patrick going to put the Question to one of 'em, he seiz'd him by the Collar, and his Companions coming to his Assistance, as by this Time did Mackavoy and Riley, to Patrick's Assistance, there began a tight Bartle, each side play'd their Hangers pretty smartly! they fought each other very close, till Patrick fired his Pistol, and one of 'em cry'd out, and directly dropt into a Ditch, and the rest made a Retreat. Patrick and his two Companions followed them up briskly, and they took to their Heels; they pursued them a little way, and then came back to look for the Man in the Ditch, whom they supposed dead; but they found he was gone, so that they imagined he was only wounded.</p>
            <p>THE next Night they went to Deptford, where they staid some little Time to drink, and then came Homewards, determined to stop any Thing they saw; they perceived a Gentleman's Coach coming along, with a Man behind it, they made directly to it, in hopes of a Prize; but found it empty: They then took the Coachman's lac'd Hat, his Shoe, Knee and Stock-Buckles; and going to the Man behind, bid him deliver; but he saying he was only a poor Man, and had begg'd the Coachman's Leave to ride a little way behind, and that he had but 9 d. in the World, they let him alone, and went home.</p>
            <p>THE Week after, they went to Hackney-Fields, and met a Man whom they stopp'd and robb'd of an eighteen Shilling Piece, a Pair of Shoe, Knee and Stock Buckles, a Hat, a Wig, and a Tobacco Box; the Tobacco Box he beg'd to have again, but they refused him, and Ryley took his Shoes off his Feet, (which he carried home, and gave to his Footman) and left him</p>

Mackavoy did accordingly come into the Savoy, and Patrick took a Purse out of his Pocket, wherein was Nine Shillings and Two-pence. Mackavoy pretended immediately to detect him, and made an Uproar in the Goal, and said he would have him tried at the Old-Bailey for it. Accordingly he went before Mr. Justice Fraser, and swore he was robbed, and the Justice granted him a Warrant, which he came (with Ryley and a pretended Constable) to execute. But Captain Dod, who is Keeper of the Savoy, having observed an Intimacy between Ryley and Patrick before, thought it looked something like a Scheme, for him to be so seemingly inveterate against him now, and accordingly told 'em, he thought they were all Rogues alike, and he should not part with his Prisoner, till he had been with, and consulted Justice Fraser.

Mr. Maurice knowing where Patrick was, went to the Savoy, and reveal'd the Affair to Capt. Dod, the Keeper, who was then more strongly confirmed in his Suspicion of him and his Companions, and accordingly after Mr. Maurice was gone, he takes Patrick up into his Room, and asks him what was in that Box he left at Mr. Maurice's, he told him only some Wearing Apparel he was taking with him to Ireland. No, says Capt. Dod, they are Watches and stolen Goods, and there will be an immediate Order for you to be sent to Newgate, and you'll stand a good Chance to be hang'd; you have but one Way left to save your own Life, which is, to turn Evidence. Patrick, after some little Hesitation and Reflection, open'd his Mind, and confess'd to the Captain he was right. The very same Night he was carried before Mr. Justice Fraser, where he made a full and free Discovery of the Robberies he had been concerned in, and named his Companions. The Justice admitted him an Evidence, and by his Direction, Mackavoy and Ryley were surprized that same Night in Bed together, at <persName id="OA17441005n130-1">

I am here under &#8220; Sentence of Death, and expect no Relife, if &#8220; some charitable Friend don't assist me; with &#8220; the Help of God my Life can be sav'd, if &#8220; proper Application be made in my Behalf, for &#8220; the Judge seemed very favourable to me, and &#8220; told me he would represent my Case before his &#8220; Majesty. I am here in the Cells where nobody &#8220; can come near me, but twice a Day. Mr. &#8220; Callehan, my Attorney, can describe the &#8220; whole Affair and Trial to you, which is tedious to mention here.</p>

            <p>L. R.</p>
            <p>Some Observations on the present dangerous Situation of the Public, from the Combination of Thieves, Pick-pockets and Street-Robbers, to carry on their Villanies in Defiance of Justice.</p>
            <p>IT was formerly the Glory of this Metropolis, that as she was the most populous, so she was the best govern'd City in Europe. We heard with Astonishment of the Cheats, Robberies, and Murders, committed in other Places, and though our Happiness was not augmented by the Miseries of our Neighbours, yet we conceiv'd it more clearly, from having frequent Opportunities of entering into such Comparisons: But now the Scene is changed; Robberies and Murders are as frequent here, as any where; and the Insolence of our Thieves is come to such a Height, that small Bye-Streets are not safe in the Day, and the most public ones are the most expos'd when once it becomes Night.</p>
            <p>THIS is not occasioned by one or two Gangs of harden'd Villains, whose Necessities render them daring, or whose Crimes have made them desperate, but it is owing to such Numbers betaking themselves to these wicked Practices, that they find themselves too strong for the ordinary Guardians of Peace; and because they frequently get the better, begin now not only to detest, but despise Justice; wrecking their Malice on innocent Persons, by Way of Revenge for the Hopes they might entertain of bringing them to their deserved End. In order to deliver us from this sad Situation, and to restore Peace and Security to honest People in the Exercise of their lawful Callings, it is hoped that our Magistrates will give some Attention to the following Points.</p>
            <p>First, It is very certain, that People are not born with particular Inclination to these base Practices; but at the same Time it is no less certain, that their Principles are very early corrupted, and that they are in a Manner educated, if not in the direct Exercise of such Rogueries, yet in the Ways that naturally lead to it. This is occasioned by a Decay of Industry, and by the prodigious Increase of late Years of Places of Diversion. There are many good Laws that require the lower Sort of People to put their Children Apprentices, so that they may be provided for during the Space of seven Years, by the Care of their Masters, and be afterwards in a Condition to maintain themselves by their own Labour, in an honest Way, which Laws of late are not put in Execution, but People are left at Liberty to breed their Children how they will, by which Means they become frequently Burdens, and too often Nusances to their Country.</p>
            <p>IN the next Place it is visible, that the multiplying of Publick Houses, or Places where Liquors are sold, encourages and spreads this Spirit of Idleness, which naturally ends in a Spirit of Rapine; because these Places where</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174410050020"/>
            <p>Spirituous Liquors are thus vended, are not immediately under the Eye of the Civil Magistrate, as all Public Houses were; and thus abundance of People are suffered to get a Livelihood at the Expence of their Neighbour's Morals, for a Habit of Drinking naturally begets a Habit of keeping ill Company, and this begets all the other ill Habits, the Effects of which were long ago foreseen, and are now become so visible, that unless they are speedily and totally suppress'd, it will really become difficult to get an honest Livelihood; because in the Winter Half Year, the Mornings and Evenings will be in a Manner useless, and all People be forced to do their Business (without Doors at least) in the Middle of the Day.</p>
            <p>ADD to this, that these Practices are extremely detrimental to Trade in another Respect, which perhaps has not been enough attended to or considered, I mean the making People afraid to wear, and consequently unwilling to purchase Rings, Watches, Snuff Boxes, or other Things of Value, because the having such Things about them, exposes them in an extraordinary Degree to the Attacks and Insults of these Sort of People, and as there are already but too many Causes of the Decay of Trade, which lie perhaps out of the Reach of our Governors to remove, there ought to be the more Care taken of those that are undoubtedly within their Power.</p>
            <p>OUR Grand Juries have shewn a great Readiness, and if proper Encouragement were given them, would be still more ready to present all such Places, as not only harbour Thieves and wicked People, but are supported and maintained by exhibiting such Diversions, as tend to render Idleness fashionable, and to take away the Shame of Vice. The Constables, and other Officers of Justice, and even the Bulk of the People in general, would be more ready to exert themselves in the Cause of Justice, if the Rewards promis'd by Act of Parliament, were regularly paid; but as the Hazard they run in taking Offenders is certain and immediate, it is impossible they should have any Spirit in running such Hazards, when the Encouragements thought necessary by the Legislature to excite such a Spirit, are very indifferently complied with, at a great Distance of Time, and after such a Train of Sollicitations, as render them no Rewards at all.</p>
            <p>THERE might be a great deal more said on so copious a Subject, but as the Magistrates have doubtless employ'd their Thoughts upon it themselves, there is the less need of entering into Particulars; these that have been touched upon are of such publick Notariety, that there is Reason to believe our Magistrates will not be displeas'd at seeing them set in a proper Light, that it may appear how necessary it is at this Juncture, to strengthen the Hands of the Officers of Justice, and to postpone all other Considerations, to that of extinguishing the present dreadful Effects of that Flood of Corruption, which has overspread these great Cities, and alarmed us in such a Manner, as Posterity will scarce Credit, and as our Forefathers never knew. The Axe must now be laid to the Root of the Tree, for Executions will signify little, if the Causes of such Crimes as bring Men to a shameful Death, be not removed.</p>
            <p>FINIS.</p>
