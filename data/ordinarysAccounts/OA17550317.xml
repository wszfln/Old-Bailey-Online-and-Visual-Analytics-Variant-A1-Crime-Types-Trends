Dyson says, that for a month or six weeks before the robbery was done, Preston never ceased, day after day, to persuade him to be accomplice with him in the robbing Mr. Huffham's house, saying, he knew the house well; that they should get money enough; and that there was no danger of being taken in the fact: to which, at length, he consented.</p>
            <p>Accordingly on Wednesday, the 9th of October, about twelve or one o'clock in the morning, having for two or three days before been idling away their time in walking the fields together, and drinking till they had not a farthing left between them, they set about the breaking open of Mr. Huffham's house at <placeName id="OA17550317-geo-15">
                  <interp inst="OA17550317-geo-15" type="type" value="parish"/>

They got in at the cellar-window, which Preston opened, and went up the cellar stairs to get into the house. They drank several bottles of liquor in the cellar, and eat bread and cheese; and then Preston unlocked the cellar door with a key he had provided himself with while he lived in the family; and through a hole he had also made before, he pushed back the bolt of the door, and so got into the house.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175503170006"/>
            <p>Having thus got into the house, Preston went directly to Mr. Huffham's bed-chamber, and Dyson followed to the head of the stairs, where he stood, while Preston went into the room, and took Mr. Huffham's gold watch from his bed's head, where it hung, and his snuff-box out of his pocket. Preston then came out to Dyson with the gold watch, &amp;c. and they went togetherinto the parlour, where Preston opened a desk with a stick, he says, and took out several things, as mentioned in the indictment. After all this was done, they went again down into the cellar, and drank another bottle or two, and so made the best of their way, meeting with no manner of interruption (tho' they had provided a broomstick to defend themselves if any body should stir); yet they thought themselves very safe from danger, and the next thing they had to consult was how to dispose of their prize.</p>
            <p>In order thereto, after consultation, they thought it would be the best way to go at a distance in the country, that they might not be detected, little thinking how near they were to betraying their own scheme. So the next morning they set out for <placeName id="OA17550317-geo-16">

            <p>
            Being both very young in years, and very ignorant, they however behaved quiet and decently, till the next sessions brought others to the same unhappy situation they were in; some of whom being more versed than they in acts of robbery, and further advanced in daring repetitions of such crimes, made Preston and Dyson more bold by their hardened behaviour and evil counsel: inasmuch as Dyson said to me one day, speaking to him of the alteration I had observed in his behaviour and manners for the worse,</p>
            <p>"Had I suffered before</p>
            <p>"the others came, I believe it had</p>
            <p>"been better for me;" or words to that effect.</p>
            <p>Dyson continued very hearty and strong to the last. His years were so tender, and his thoughts so vague, that though, when talking to him, you might find him affected with a sense of his lost condition, expressed by his tears; yet no sooner was he out of hearing and sight, but the little levities of childhood, as it were, attacked him again, and the motion of a straw would cause him to laugh, and look as pleasant as if nothing had been the matter with him; as if under no calamity.</p>
            <p>Preston put on the appearance of a penitent, and behaved as one would expect a person under his unhappy circumstances. He was well and hearty till within about a fortnight before he suffered; and then he took to his cell, and pretended he could not stand upon his legs: but, the Saturday night before he suffered, he made an attempt to escape, and worked such a breach in his cell, as was scarce to be thought of, and surprized every one that saw it. It was indeed a vain attempt; for if he had worked for a month without interruption, he could never have effected an escape.</p>
            <p>Dyson before attempted the like, but had not gone so far as Preston did. Though very young, their inclinations to mischief were as strong as others of larger experience and years; for I scarce ever saw an attempt before to break out of the cells. All their attempts were in the night, when they thought every thing was quiet, and out of hearing their works; but there were not wanting, in the many attempts made by these unhappy people, some to discover and frustrate their plots and contrivances, which, tho' they were mean and ineffectual, shewed their earnest desire to escape from that fate, which they owned themselves sensible they had legally merited.</p>
            <p>The propensities of nature strove hard to get off from it, but proper care preserved them for their destined fate. They both suffered, declaring a dependance and trust in the mercies of God, and promises through Christ's, merits; and to those mercies we must leave them. If their juvenile years were such, as no lasting impressions were to be made upon their minds, who but God, through Christ, can procure a salve for their sores!</p>

            <p>His first place in town, he says, was at a grocer's, where he lived many months honestly, doing his business regularly as he received directions, and left this service with reputation, and was recommended to Mr. Royds, with whom he lived in the house, and upon whom he committed the robbery for which he suffered. Haynes and one Cowley were countrymen, and had beenformerly acquainted. Upon Haynes's coming to town, their acquaintance was renewed, to the great detriment of both; for, upon Haynes's capital conviction, Cowley being tried with him, for receiving the goods, knowing them to be stolen, the jury being of opinion that he knew them to be stolen, from many circumstances appearing in course of evidence, found him guilty also, and Cowley received the judgment of the court to be transported for fourteen years.</p>
            <p>Haynes, tempted by hopes of getting money faster than the nature of his place would admit, observing the large stock of goods in the house, was prompted by the devil, he says, to set his mind upon robbing his master; supposing that out of such large quantities, a piece now and then was not to be missed. The next thing was, what should he do with his stolen goods? It came into his head, that his old acquaintance Cowley, being a taylor, might help him off, and accordingly he put it to the trial. Sundry goods at times, Haynes says, he stole from his master, and carried to Cowley; and that Cowley came to his master's house, and fetched away the other goods himself, which Haynes delivered to him. He says, he was allowed 1 s. per yard, for the goods which Cowley sold for two; so that the value of the goods was equally divided between them. Haynes alwas declared, no body put him upon this; 'twas his own thought, and would by no means charge any body else with being concerned with him, except Cowley. Haynes behaved like a true penitent, heartily sorry for what he had done in this, and all respects amiss against God, and all law; and owned the justice of his conviction. And, being soon after conviction, taken very ill, continued so till he suffered; which he did with all patience and resignation, hoping that God would be merciful to him hereafter, as he saw his contrition earnest and sincere, and having his faith fixed on the merits of Christ's blood.</p>

His father was very well known to be a very worthy and industrious man in his way of business, but some how had not the happiness to succeed so well in trade, as 'twas by all that knew him thought he might have done. He left behind him this unhappy youth, who has not proved so well as was in his father's life-time hoped, and believed he had then the appearance of doing. He was in person a likely young fellow, had the blessing of a good understanding given him from above, which he has unhappily since most grosly abused, as well as that education which was bestowed on him by his father.</p>

            <p>When he was about 12 or 13 years of age, he says, his father died, and as he proved a forward youth, preparations were made for sending him abroad, that he might see the world a little, and improve his knowledge of it to a better purpose, than as it has proved in the event, to his great misfortune, he chose to do. In pursuanceof the good intentions of his friends, he says, he did go abroad, and was on a voyage to the <placeName id="OA17550317-geo-53">

The truth of which depends upon his own words, as this was his own declaration. He said further, that he might have staid there; and believes he should not have come home so soon, but that he expected a good fortune to come to, when he arrived in <placeName id="OA17550317-geo-54">

But when he came home, being disappointed as to that expectation, and having already entertained notions of a gay life, he could not forbear pursuing it, though he knew he had not wherewithal long to support it. However, he continued it till all he had was exhausted; all places of public diversion being his daily resort; besides that, he was too prone to the allurements of the stews, and disorderly-houses of the town, and had an itching after all gaming tables he could get admittance to.</p>
            <p>Indulgence from some quarter kept his imagination fixed in a security which push'd him forward to his ruin, that no end should be to his gaiety. But, finding the means of encouragement fail, at least not so flush as formerly, he began to think of shifting for himself, and of cutting out a way to provide for his extravagances at all events. He was too much indulged to be bred to any business, to which he might turn his hand to get an honest livelihood, and therefore his invention must be employed to supply the place of that industry, which 'twas pity he had not been put in the way of. If ever he was designed for business, he was not not kept to it; but, he says, he was bred to no particular trade, which he pretended to lay any claim to the knowledge of. Unhappy youth! what should he do? No employment to turn his hand to live honestly, and so he became a professed debauchee, gambler, and highwayman, tho' very artfully, and private in his doings. His deeds were deeds of darkness, and therefore he was rarely to be seen, but in the night.</p>
            <p>He acknowledges to have been a very bad liver, in all sorts of debauched and evil conversation, but for private reasons he had to himself, though he could not but own the justice of his fate, he would not suffer his deeds to be expos'd to light here, except such as were too publick for him to conceal.</p>

            <p>This was declared by him, before the person suffered; nor had the unhappy Delarant so feared and hardened a conscience, as to deny it, nor the before-mentioned facts. However, even though he had strong assurances from his friends, that they had interest enough to save his life, and though he was recommended to mercy by the jury that tried him, yet he behaved extremely well from the time of his conviction. Indeed, expecting from such motives to have life saved, his disappointment was greater, when he found himself included in the warrant for execution. But he soon recovered from this disappointment, by fixing his hopes and expectations where no such thing can happen to those, who endeavour to gain a reprieve from the jaws of death eternal, by flying to those conditions of the gospel of Christ, to which are promised life eternal.</p>

The prosecutor had no sooner told the court the manner in which he was robbed, and said, he could not swear to him, though he believed him to be the man, than Delarant (through the conviction of his own mind) was so infatuated as to own the fact, at the same time he thought he was clearing himself, by asking him, whether he had any thing about his head or face? Had no other evidence charged him home, this was enough to satisfy all that heard him of his guilt; but he was taken the next day, with the things he had taken from the prosecutor upon him, and a pistol in his pocket, but not loaded, as his horse was shoeing at the blacksmith's shop. He was suspected to be highwayman, and being apprehended upon the suspicion, to his cost proved to be so. The horse he rode on was ordered, by the court, to the captor, upon his conviction, pursuant to the act of the 4th and 5th of William the third, which gives the horse, money, arms, and furniture, to the captor, taken on a robber, except the same be feloniously taken away before the robbery. By this statute, the person who lends or lets a horse to a highwayman, forfeits the same upon conviction.</p>
            <p>Delarant owned the justice of his suffering, as also his general immoral life, and died resigned to the will of God, whose promises through Christ he sought in an humble and contrite heart.</p>

It is not out of spite that I send you this, for I freely forgive you from my very soul; though the money and things you have had of me is the very cause of my unhappy sentence. If you had tasted of both those evils, as you called them, it would have been the better for me; for I should have had money in my pocket, and have been a great part of my intended voyage. As my time is short for this world, I once more forgive you.

Upon this robbery, being represented to him, and the persons described; Mr. Fielding's people got intelligence of it, and pursued them in their haunts to apprehend them.</p>
            <p>They were taken soon after. Burk was terribly wounded, having fought desperately, and given Hind, one of the people that took him, a wound, which caused his arm to be cut off, in consequence of which he died.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of January, we have this account of their being taken, in one of the daily papers. Information being given, that the mother of Burk, lodged at Hyde-Park-corner, and sold old-cloaths, Mr. Gee, a constable, and Mr. Pentelour, keeper of New-prison, were sent to make enquiry, on which a plan might be formed to take Gill and Burk.

As soon as they perceived they were taken notice off, they paid their reckoning hastily, and attempted to make off. The constable seized one by the collar, on which Gill fired a pistol, in the very face of the constable, which luckily did him no injury, though 'twas loaded with balls and shot, which grazed his cheek. The constable quitted Burk, to pursue Gill, who fired at him; this gave Burk an opportunity to draw his pistol, which he presented to the head of Mr. Pentelour; who in an instant rushed in upon him; disarmed him, and by endeavouring to secure him, they both fell over a water-tub, by which means Burk disengaged himself, and they both made their escape in the dark. But the mother being taken, an account of their lodging in Shadwell was obtained, and a strong party set out next morning by break of day, to surprise them in their beds. But they being alarmed, by one of their whores, retired to the Strand for safety, where three of Mr. Fielding's people, just returned from a private expedition, had intelligence of them, and resolved to attack them. And rushing into a room, where they were, with drawn hangers, desired them to surrender. Upon which they started up, drew</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175503170020"/>
            <p>their pistols, and declared they would not be taken alive. But they were soon disarmed, and Gill after receiving a wound or two, submitted; but Burk, though his hand that held the pistol was almost cut off, and had received many wounds in his face and head, would not surrender till he was totally overpowered, and the vast loss of blood rendered him incapable of farther resistance. How valuable such a resolution, had it been employed in a good cause! but how to be dreaded in the hands of robbers! two of Mr. Fielding's people having paid dear; one having received a terrible wound in his arm, and another had his knee put out, several bruises, and one desperate wound in his hand.</p>

But where's the wonder, when we consider him as scarce past childhood; having never been exercised, but in puerile amusements; having had no education; and scarce ever having heard there was a God and a future state, till under sentence of death.
