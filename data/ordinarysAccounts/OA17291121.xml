            <p>Whiie under Sentence of Death, they were instructed from these Words, St. Mat. 1. 21. And thou shall call his Name Jesus; for he shall save his People from their Sins: in the great Design of the Christian Salvation; which consists not in an empty speculative Faith, that the Son of God died for the Sins of the World, but in an active Faith attended with good Works, bringing forth the peacable Fruits of Righteousness, which are to the Glory and Praise of God; for, Faith without Works is dead, being alone, St. James, 2 17. I shew'd them, that there is no doubt, but Christ delivers Men from eternal Death and Hell Torments, which is the Punishment that is due unto our Sins; this Christ has undoubtedly purchas'd for all those that are his. Rom. 8. 1. Now therefore there is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after Spirit. God who might in Justice exact those Punishments, is now reconcil'd to us by the Death of his Son, having given to us the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we can cry Abba, Father. As for this Deliverance from the Worm of Conscience and eternal Fire of Hell, it is what all Men must greatly esteem, for who can abide with everlasting Burnings? And therefore among all those, who are not atheistical or desperately Wicked, we find few or none, who will not make some outward Profession, and perform some Acts of Religion, that thereby they might quiet their Consciences, with some Confidence, although never so Groundless, of their Share in this Salvation. I convinc'd them in how many Instances they had been Guilty of the Breach of their baptismal Vows, for which they ought bitterly to mourn before God, to renew themselves by an unfeigned Repentance, and by partaking in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as a certain Emblem and Pledge of our everlasting Enjoyment of, and Communion with God and Christ, in Heaven hereafter.</p>
            <p>While these and many other Instructions were given, They were all attentive to my Exhortations, and made regular Responses to the Prayers. Bolton and Oliver, were most of the Time Sick, <persName id="OA17291121n8-1">

I beg of all good Christians to ' Pray for my departing Soul, for I must own I have ' been a great Offender, and have run a long Race in ' Wickedness, and am now justly cut off for my past ' Offences. So the Lord of his infinite Mercy Pardon ' me, my Sins, Lord Jesus receive me, and into thy ' Hands O Lord I commend my Spirit.</p>
