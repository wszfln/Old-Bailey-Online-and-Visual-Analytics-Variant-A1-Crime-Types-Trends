I convinced them of their Deficiency in the Performance of Christian Duties, and how guilty they had been of the Breach of their Baptismal Vows, and of their State of Infidelity.

            <p>They were diligently exhorted to an unfeigned Repentance of all their Sins, and to resolve, by the Grace of God, to forsake them; and in Token of the Sincerity of their Repentance, to renew their Baptismal Vows by receiving the blessed Sacrament of our Lord's last Supper, by which the Blessings of the Covenant of Grace, are sealed and applied to all true Believers.</p>

Bullock, Barrow, Purdy, and Richardson, were ignorant and illiterate, but they behaved decently. Barrow at first dissembled, and pretended to be so ignorant, as not to be able to understand any thing; but afterwards he appeared to know as much as any of them, and carried himself indifferently well. Totterdale (except 2 or 3 Days) was all the Time sick; he appeared to be a mean cowardly spirited Person, for his Illness did not proceed from Sickness, but from a certain Lowness of Spirit and Dejection of Mind, occasioned by the Torments of an evil Conscience, Furies and Vultures being (as he confessed) constantly preying upon his Heart. Clark and Franklin were sick most of the Time, but they were humble and submissive, and behaved well.</p>

He married a Wife about two Years ago, who, upon his Misfortunes, was so over-whelm'd with Grief and Sorrow, that she died before the Report was made. She told him, it would be her Fate to die before him, of Grief, Shame and Discontent, which accordingly happen'd. He said, that Wilson the Evidence against him, was the chief Instrument in drawing him to Sin, for he used to drink with him to excess, and then would persuade him to go on the Highway, and that Night they robb'd Mr. Christian, they were all very Drunk, and none of them knew what they were doing. He said, he had not committed above two or three Street-Robberies, besides this for which he died; but for some Years past, he confess'd he had follow'd Picking of Pockets in the Evening. In the former Part of his Life, he was not so vicious, but pretty regular, and went frequently to Church; but no sooner did he take himself to bad Company, and a profligate Way of Life, but he renounc'd Religion, Sobriety, and the Fear of God. He lamented, and shed Tears, when he reflected upon the extreme Folly of his Actions, to which he said he had no Temptation, because he might have been in good Business, and have wanted for nothing. He always behaved well, both in the Cell, and in Publick, appearing truly Penitent for the many Sins and Crimes of his Life. He declar'd his Hopes of Salvation through the Merits of Jesus Christ, repented of his Sins, and dy'd in Peace with all the World.</p>

This seeming Kindness did not last long, for the poor Woman being a little in Drink, went up Stairs to lie down upon a Bed; upon this the Devil entered Totterdale, and in a violent Fit of Passion he ran up Stairs after her, dragg'd her out of Bed by the Heels, and beat her and stamped upon her in a most barbarous and cruel Manner; upon somebody's speaking to him and upbraiding him with Cruelty, he left her and went down Stairs; they hid her at the Foot of a Bed; but his violent Passion and cruel Disposition still continuing, he went up Stairs again, and opened the Chamber Door which a Lodger had locked upon her, and found her; with great Fury he threw her upon the Floor, and a Man aying hold on him to hinder him, he sprang from him, and threw her down the Stairs, himself following, kicking and stamping upon her Belly, Breast, Legs, Head, and other Parts of the Body, till he had kick'd and spurn'd her to the Bottom; then he dragged her into a little Room which was their Bedchamber, shut the Door upon them, and continued beating her in this unmerciful Manner till she died; all this was done in less than the Space of one Hour, and without any the least Provocation, she not having been heard to say any Thing that might provoke him thus barbarously to treat her, only she at first cried out two or three Times Murder, and when her Strength was quite spent, she was heard speaking faintly twice or thrice. Johnny, Johnny, don't kill me; for God's Sake don't murder me, or to that Purpose. Nine of her Ribs were broken, some of them into three, four, or six Pieces, one of them was all shatter'd into small Pieces and beat upon her Kidneys. When this was done, he lock'd his dead Wife up in the Room, and for two Hours nobody offered to lay hold on him; during which Time, though he might have made his Escape, he was in such Confusion, and his Conscience so perplexed, that he could not move out of the Place, till a Soldier and a Constable came and carried him, without any Disturbance, before a Justice, who committed him to the Gatehouse till he was removed to <placeName id="OA17371005-geo-32">

He pretended to be sick, and kept the Cell most of the Time he was under Sentence, but his Indisposition proceeded more from Fear and Trouble, and Sulliness of Mind, than any Sickness of Body, for when the Dead-Warrant came down, he attended regularly in Chapel, and was attentive to Prayers and Exhortations, though indeed he did not seem so deeply affected as he ought to have been, yet when I spoke to him, he sometimes would cry and weep a little. He was an obdurate hard-hearted Wretch, but profess'd a deep Repentance for all the Sins of his Life, especially the great Crime of murdering his own Wife; that he believed in Christ, and was in Peace with all Men.</p>

            <p>APPENDIX.</p>
            <p>IT has been customary to give the Publick a farther Account of the unfortunate Creatures who are the Subjects of these Papers, than what is contained in the preceeding Part; for Insincerity and Prevarication is too constantly discover'd in these unhappy Wretches, by those appointed to attend them in their last Moments. The truest Accounts of themselves, and of their Offences, are generally to be collected from their scatter'd Papers, and from the Discoveries they make therein to their particular Friends and old Companions.</p>

            <p>Frequent have been the Uproars between him and his Wife, and for this 5 or 6 Years last past, the barbarous Usage she received from him, has been known to all who lived near them. He had but very little to say in Excuse of his horrid Crime, and the whole Time that he was in Custody he appeared stupid, and sullen, and very seldom spoke to any one. Two or three Days after he had been in the Gate house, the Deceased's Sister went to see him; she cry'd - O John! John! how could you be so barbarous as to murder your Wife! He replied, The Devil over powered me, - I was push'd on by the Devil, both to begin and finish the Deed - I cannot recall or undo what I have done, - but I wish I could bring back my poor unhappy, unprepared Wife from the Grave again.</p>
            <p>He was asked why he did not endeavour to make his Escape after he had committed the Fact, instead of continuing in the Room with his murder'd Wife? His Answer was, that he did intend to have got away, but as he was coming out of the Room from the dead Woman, he imagin'd he heard a Voice saying, John, John, stay, - what have you done, - you can't go off, and from that Instant he had no Power to stir.</p>
            <p>While he was in Custody in the Gate-house, he was visited often by one M - t F - r, with whom he used to keep Company; she embrac'd him, and publickly declared, That if he should happen to be Transported, she would go with him at all Events, which being heard by some young Gentlemen of Westminster School, they resented the impudent Behaviour of the Creature, and it was with some Difficulty she escaped Discipline in Tuttle Fields.</p>
            <p>He declared that he was not afraid to suffer the ignominious Death that was before him, nor did he desire to avoid it; if (said he) my Sentence had been, not only that I should die, but that I should die by Piece-meal, - by suffering Tortures, as such a Criminal as I must have given up Life in some other Nations, yet that would have been welcome to me: -'tis my Crime (added he) and not my Punishment that affects me.</p>
            <p>The Day the Dead Warrant came down to Newgate, he was acquainted that he was included therein, and that he must die on Wednesday next; to which he answer'd, - the Lord's Will be done; I am ready to die, I am willing to die; - only I bg of God that I may not (tho' I deserve it) die an eternal Death, and tho' I die out of this World for my heinous Crimes, and aggravated Offences, yet I hope 'tis not impossible for me to be forgiven - not impossible I should live for ever in a better State, and seeming in a sort of Transport, he cry'd out, - God bless his Majesty and my honourable Judges, they have done me no wrong, they are just, 'tis I that have offended, and have been guilty of the unnatural Murder of my poor Wife, the Lord be more merciful to me than I was to her, or else I perish. Then he desir'd</p>

            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>' I Return you a thousand Thanks for all your 'great Kindness to my 2 Children, whom you ' have been so good as to take Care of, since I ' have been under my unhappy Misfortunes; I ' hope God will recompence you for it, the Blessing ' of Almighty God be with you and yours, hoping the Lord will make you Recompence and ' yours; and I pray God prosper you and yours, ' as long as you live, for the extraordinary Favour done unto my Children. My Prayers to ' God for all Friends and Neighbours, hoping ' that they won't reflect upon my poor aged Mother and my two Children, for my Misfortune ' that has befell me, which I never intended; nor ' did I ever think of coming to such a shameful ' End, which I hope God in his great Power will ' have Mercy on my poor Soul, and forgive me ' all my Sins, as I put my Trust in him; and I ' beg (if the Favour is not too great) of all Love ' that you would desire all such Friends that ' shall come to see me Dye, that they will be so ' good as not to let the Surgeons have my Body, ' but to give me their Assistance, for my Brother ' and other Friends have promised me so to do; ' which I hope in God they will, for my desire is ' to lay by my Wife if possible I can. I beg of all ' Love that my Acquaintance that comes, that ' they will be so good as to assist my Body to some ' convenient House just by the Place where I did ' live, which I hope in God they will; and in so ' doing, I shall be thankful for it. So to the Lord ' I recommend my Soul, and the blessing of Almighty God be with you and yours for ever. ' Amen.</p>
            <p>N. B. I must beg your Patience for a few Words more, and then I shall conclude: Some Persons who were Witnesses against me at my Tryal happened to be Drinking at my House at the same Time the Quarrel began between me and my Wife, and perceiving me in a violent Passion with her, yet they never offer'd to stir to appease me, tho' one of them came up Stairs and saw her lying on the Floor, which if they had been so kind as to have done, she would have been alive now, and I should not have suffered that ignominious Death, which I shall To-morrow. I freely forgive every Person that appear'd against me at my Trial, as I hope God of his infinite Mercy will forgive me.</p>
            <p>From my Cell in Newgate, October 4, 1737.</p>
            <p>J. TOTTERDALE.</p>
            <p>When the Day of his Death was approaching a Reverend Divine, out of a compassionate Regard to his State, wrote him a Letter, which made a deep Impression on his Mind, and further'd him in the great Work that was before him; a Copy thereof follows,</p>
            <p>For Mr. Totterdale in Newgate.</p>
            <p>Mr. Totterdale.</p>
            <p>THO' I have but little Knowledge of you yet I am exceedingly troubled that you should commit such a barbarous inhumane Fact, as the Murder of your poor Wife, by which you have brought your self to such a shameful and untimely End. You have but a little while to live in this World; I beseech you to lose no Minute of it, but fast and pray. Retire from Company, and cry mightily to God for Mercy, God has ordain'd a Saviour for Sinners, his Son Jesus Christ, who is able to save the worst of Sinners, and will not cast out any that come to him in a penitent Manner, with a lively Faith in him. This is the only Way of Salvation; here spend all that little remaining part of your Time, and I pray God grant you Mercy through the Merit of his Son, and Sanctification of his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>It is but a few Hours and you will appear before your Judge; therefore bend all the Powers of your Soul to seek Reconciliation with him, thro' the great Peace-Offering, the Sacrifice of our Saviour on the Cross.</p>
            <p>For other Things I leave you to the Direction of the Reverend Mr. Guthrie, recommending you in my Prayers to the Mercy of Almighty God thro' his Grace.</p>
            <p>I am your Friend,</p>

He would frequently tell the rest of his Fellow Suffer's (who behav'd more decently than himself) that they need not make so much to do about their Repentance and their repenting, for he could repent himself as clean from all his Sins in half an Hour as well as in 7 Years. For such Speeches he was reprov'd, and made sensible that sincere Repentance, such as necessary to Salvation, was a great and difficult Work; that it imply'd not only a Concern and Sorrow for Sin, but an entire Change of Heart and Mind, and a newness of Disposition and Spirit, as well as of Life. Upon such Remonstrances, he would seem to be affected, and would sometimes complain of the badness and hardness of his Heart. He was not willing to own the Fact (as a Robbery) for which he suffer'd, no-(he said) he never robb'd any poor Person, but only such as were able to bear it, and they would not suffer by what he robb'd them of, and Master, says he, there's no great Sin in that. He was told, that his Duty and Interest obliged him to behave in a more serious Manner, that he ought to consider himself as one who had but few Moments more to live. Why, Master says he, I can't perswade myself that I have committed any great Crime in robbing the Rich, - I think I have not, for to let you know Sir, said he, all the People I used to rob had too much Money, and I had too little. Thus he constantly endeavour'd to extenuate his Crimes, and would fain have appear'd - tho' a Thief - a conscientious one. He said, he wish'd he could have known before he took his Trial, that he should have been capitally convicted, for then he would have dy'd with some of his own Companions, and would jamm'd 2 or 3 of them for Fun; for he could he said, have made some Discovery of the Persons that were concern'd with him, but since if he did it now, they would not be hang'd with him, therefore he was resolv'd to make no Discovery at all.</p>
            <p>Thus he behav'd, and shew'd how little sensible he was of his Condition, and how unconcern'd at his approaching Death; he was always laughing and jesting, to divert himself and others, instead of preparing himself for his shameful End.</p>

The Owner of the Meat was alarmed by the Watch, when they found his Shop broke, so he came and claimed the Goods, and the poor Fellow was sent to Tothill-Fields Bridewell, as I had like to have found to my Cost, for not knowing he was there confined, I went thither to see one of my Friends; while I was talking with him, the Butcher observed me, and knowing me again, he charged me with being the Man that desired him to watch the Basket. I absolutely denied the Charge, and pleaded Ignorance in the Affair; so after he had been some Time confined, his Friends made up the Affair, and he was discharged. I was concern'd at bringing him into all this Trouble and Expence, but I could not help him without bringing myself into the Scrape. The Man now lives at Mr. Lewis's, a Butcher, the Corner of the Play-House by Covent-Garden.</p>
            <p>Another time I broke open Mr. Waller's Slaughter-House, and found there a Whole Heifer hung up against the next Day's Market; I could not move the whole Carcass, so I cut all the Meat from the Bones, and carried it away in Baskets. I desire this may be mentioned particularly, because I am informed that a young Man was accused of this Fact, and whipped publickly for it.

I thought if we searched them narrowly we might find something else, so I drove the Man, and Lamb drove the Woman into a Field full of Cows, at some Distance from the Road. When we had them here, Lamb was resolved to strip them stark naked, and take all their Cloaths. I oppos'd it, because it was exceeding cold, and determined not to carry away their Cloaths. But we made them both pull off Shoes, Stockings, Shirt, Shift, - they stripped themselves as naked as they came into the World. Then we swore they should dance Adam and Eve three Times round the Field, which they did, and complaining of our Barbarity and the Coldness of the Weather, I told them I would be kinder to them than they imagined, for I would look out for something piping hot for them, and just as I had told them this, a Cow happened to Dung, so I brought them to the Place, and Lamb and I stood over them and made them eat it all up, before we would suffer them to put their Cloaths on. We stood by them till they were dress'd, and as the Man was putting on his Shoes, Lamb d - 'd him because his Shoes were best, and swore he must exchange with him, telling him, Exchange was no Robbery.

Mr. D &#8211; r knew it, so he stopped the Watch and the Man that brought it, and sent for the Gentleman that owned it. When he came he took his Watch, and sent the Man that brought it about his Business, least he should be obliged to give an Account how he lost it.

            <p>I always lived an uneasy, dissatisfy'd Life, and when I got Money, I used to spend it idly and in bad Company.

            <p>My last Request is, That none would reflect on my Friends for my shameful Life; in particular I hope no one will blame my Sister, for she has been very good to me; she put me out Apprentice, and found me in Necessaries all my 7 Years; in Return of which I have been very ungrateful, and have behaved to her with the greatest Cruelty and Kindness.</p>

Here the Spaniards watch'd them that they might not get away from them; but he and another gave them the Slip, and got away into the Woods, where they lived 6 Days upon raw Wood, Crabs, and what grew in the Woods. At last they ventur'd out into a Savannah, where they saw a House built with Reeds, this was one of the Spaniards Hunting Houses, for they frequently went 30 or 40 Miles to hunt wild Cattle, and often take up their Lodging in such Houses; they are built upon Poles above the Ground, and the Entrance into them is by a Ladder. Barrow got into this House to see for something to eat, and there he found a great Roll of Tobacco and some Fruit, which the Spaniards call Bernadoes; but as he and his Companions were retreating to the Woods again, they heard a Noise, and presently 3 or 4 Men on Horseback rode up to them, and threat'ned to cut their Heads off if they did not return to the Place from whence they had escaped, they could make no Resistance, and so being ty'd to the Horses Tails they were brought to the rest of their Companions again, and here they stay'd about a Fortnight longer, and liv'd very hard.</p>

After they had lain concealed here a great while, they ventur'd to a little Town, where the People were tolerably Civil to them; but at last they grew weary of their Company, and so bought them a large Canoe to carry them to <placeName id="OA17371005-geo-113">

They kept with their Canoe, always as near the Shores as they could; and whenever they came to any Island, where they imagin'd they could kill any-thing for their Subsistance, they used to draw their Canoe a-shore, and hide her, while they search'd the Place. This Trade they follow'd, 'till one Morning, they unhappily stav'd their Canoe, as they were getting her a-shore. Then they were altogether at a Loss, and were forced to betake themselves to the Woods in the Day-time, and at Night to come out for Provision. Sometimes they kill'd a wild Hog, and sometimes stole a Calf, which they brought into the Woods, and eat half roasted, and half raw.</p>
