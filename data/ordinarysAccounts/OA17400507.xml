            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174005070003"/>
            <p>While under Sentence, they were instructed how necessary it is to be contented with that Lot and Condition, in which God hath placed us in the World, since Discontentedness is the Cause of that Vice, namely Covetousness, for which all of them suffered so much Disgrace and Shame; and this Contentedness we showed them, is, being well pleased with that Condition, whatever it is, that God hath placed us in, not murmuring and repining at our Lot, but chearfully welcoming whatsoever God sends. How great and pleasant a Vertue this is, will appear by the contrariety it hath to several painful Vices; for where this is rooted in the Heart, it not only subdues some single Sin, but a Cluster of Sins together; it is contrary to the Sin of Murmuring, which we find so much reproved in the Israhtes; and if it be a pleasant Thing to be thankful, murmuring must be unpleasant and troublesome; it is contrary to Ambition, that makes one displeased with his present Condition; to Covetousness, as the Apostle witnesseth, Heb. 13. 5. Let your Conversation be without Covetousness, and be content with such Things as you have. Where we see Contentedness set in a direct Opposition to Covetousness, which is a very great Crime, as being contrary to the very Foundation of all good Life; those three great Duties we owe to God, to ourselves, and to our Neighbours. It is contrary to our Duty to God, Luke 16, 13, We cannot serve God and Mammon. It is contrary to our Duty to our selves, both in respect of our Souls and Bodies. The Covetous Man despises his Soul, by selling it to eternal Destruction for a little Money, which the Apostle calls the Row of all Evil, and which can be of no Use to us in the Distress, and much less in the Hour of Death: Upon the covetous Person, the Apostle pronounceth, That he shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, 1 Cor. 6. 10. And the Covetous Man offendeth not only against his Soul, but his Body too, in denying those necessary Refreshments it wants, for which Riches, so far as they concern himself, were given him. And Covetousness is contrary to the Duty we owe to our Neighbours, in both Parts of it, Justice and Charity.</p>
            <p>From many such Considerations as these, we took Occasion to expose to them, the great Wickedness of their Lives, which had been a direct Contradiction to every Thing that's Religions and Virtuous, for which now the heavy Judgments of God had overtaken them.</p>
            <p>One of them convicted of that heinous and attrocious Sin of Murder, I exhorted to think upon the Wickedness of his Life, and what it was that brought him into the Commission of so vile an Action, his unbridled Passion, want of Consideration, and having no regard to the fear and love of God, which Dispositions if he had been endowed with, they must necessarily have restrained him from such an outragious Action, whereby a Man is at once divested of all Humanity, and reduced into the pestiferous Nature of the most voracious and destructive Animals, whose only delight it is to tear in Pieces, and destroy their Fellow-Creatures.</p>

This poor unhappy Man often used his Wife very ill; particularly one Time when she had not lain in about two or three Weeks, he came up to her Bedside, swearing and cursing her after a terrible Manner, that for fear he should do her a Mischief, she got out of Bed with the Infant in her Arms, and went down with a Rope which goes along the Stairs to avoid him; and several Times he has thrown the Choping Knives at her. He cared not what he did when he was in Liquor, but behaved like a Madman, and one out of his Senses, which made him uneasy in Company, and to do a great many out of the Way little Things, and to express himself very undecently, to curse and blaspheme at a prodigious rate, so that he was lookt upon as a very irregular Man, and unaccountable in many of his Actions; and these Miscarriages were the Occasion of all his future Misfortunes; yet untill he happened to commit this Murder, he never did harm to any Body.

All this might be the Effects of Drink, not knowing what he said, but this is no Excuse. The first Sunday Mr. Clements did not come up to Chapel, being a little indisposed; he came up on Monday Afternoon, and when I spoke to him, he was mightily concerned and wept, and said, he knew nothing of the Matter, and was very much griev'd and sorry for what had happened, and heartily repented for it, promising all due care in Preparation for Death, and working out his Soul's Salvation by the Grace of God, hoping in the Mercy of God through Christ. He behav'd well under Sentence, and declar'd himself sincerely penitent for all the Sins of his Life, especially the crying and grievous Sin of Murder.

Upon which Parker and his Friend B - desired the young Man to be in the Way at such a Time, and they would call and let him know their Success; the poor Country Fellows being in hopes of getting a good Place, used to think Parker and his Companion the best Friends they ever met with in their Life, when at the same Time their chief Design was only to fleece them.</p>

When he had won about 15 or 18 s. I fancy Friend John, says Parker  B -, we shall win of you all you have  if we go on; come, says B -, I'll  with you for more if you think so, so then  Parker could get the Countryman to consent, they used to play for six Times the Sum which they at first play'd for, when B - was sure to win; by this Means they often strip'd the Countrymen of what Money they have had about them, to the amount sometimes of 12 or 14 l. at a Time, which they have won by these Means; and when they found that they had no Opportunity of taking Countrymen in this Way by Cards, they used to have Recourse to some other Stratagems, one of which Adventures of that Nature was thus, Parker and his Friend D &#8211; B - picking up one Day at an Inn a Countryman who had newly come from Chester, and finding that they cou'd do no good with him by Cards, for he neither cared for playing, going halves, nor betting, upon which they amused him (in the Manner before described) with hopes of getting a Place, and as was before observed, he was to see the Gentleman on the third Day after their new meeting; on the Day that he was to be introduced, Parker comes very early in the Morning, and tells him if he would get up he might go along with him, and have an Opportunity of seeing the Town, and likewise of being very well entertained, for he was going to several Places to buy Jewels and other Curiosities for his Master; the Countryman swallow'd the bait, hurried on his Cloaths, and got himself clean in a trice, in order to accompany this new Acquaintance to see the Town, and likewise to go and wait upon his new Master that was to be, and in order to appear more grand, he put all his Money which he had in his Box into his Pocket, to the amount of about 15 l. when he had so done, away posts Parker and he to several Toyshops; now Parker took the Countryman along with him when he went in to any of these Shops, and said, he was a Servant to my Lord such a one, naming some Nobleman of Distinction, and that he wanted to see such and such particular Toys, which commonly was shown him with much Civility, and after he had look'd over several, he seem'd not to like them, but at last looking upon an Equipage, he asked the Gentleman of the Shop the Value of it, who told him it was worth 20 l. Parker told him, that he would acquaint his Lord, and that he would call to Morrow about it.</p>
            <p>Now Parker had led the Countryman almost the Town over, and at those Places where he pretended to pay Money, he desired the Countryman to wait at the Door a little till he came out, and then going in to ask some frivulous Question, used to tell the Countryman when he came out, that he had been paying for some Things which he had order'd to be sent Home which was bespoke: As soon as he came out of the Toy-Shop, Parker ask'd</p>

Yea, says the Countryman, 'twas wounded fine; Aye, replies Parker, I would have bought it, but I have been buying so many Things that I have laid out all my Master's Money which I brought out with me, except about 10 l. now I know my Master will like it prodigiously. Egad, says Parker, I'll beg a Favour of you, I'll tell you what you shall do, lend me 10 l. and I'll step back and fetch it, and you shall be paid the Money immediately when I come Home, besides, in doing this you make my Master your Friend, for I'll tell him who I borrowed the Money of when we get Home; Come, says the Countryman, we'll drink our Wine out and I'll go along with you; come along, says Parker, but first you'd as good let me have the Money, because I wou'd not have my Master look scandalous in the Shop, upon which the Countryman opens his Purse, and tells him out 10 l. and after paying for the Wine, they went in order to go to the Toy-shop, and as they were going along, Parker espies a House which had a back Door, says he to the Countryman, O Lord! I had forgot, I must deliver a Message here, do you wait at the Door and I'll come out again presently; so in he went, and under a Pretence of asking some frivolous Question, immediately slip'd out at the back Door, leaving the Countryman waiting at the Door leaning against a Post, thinking it long till his new Acquaintance came out to him.</p>
            <p>Another Time Joseph pick'd up a Country Fellow, and after having some Discourse together, took him to see the Town: Parker carrying him through <placeName id="OA17400507-geo-66">

                        targets="OA17400507n43-1 OA17400507-geo-66"/>Drury-Lane</placeName>, the Countryman espy'd some Ladies of Pleasure very gayly dressed, which made his Mouth water: Wounds! says the Countryman, that's a fine Woman. Parker knowing her, steps up, and tells her he had got a Country Chub, and ask'd her if she'd go and drink a Glass of Wine, and desired her to humour the Joak, and pass for Parker's Cousin. So stepping back again tells the Countryman, that that Lady was a Person of 1000 l. Fortune, and was his Cousin; and he told the Countryman, she seemed to be much taken with his Person, and said he was a very handsome Man, and moreover, added Parker, I have asked her to go and drink a Glass of Wine, will you go also and drink with her? Aye! reply'd the Countryman overjoy'd, with all my Heart. So away they go to a House hard by, and Parker's Friend D. B. attended as a Drawer: After they had drank a Bottle of Wine or two, the Countryman was very much elevated, and began to be very sweet upon Parker's Cousin; in the mean Time Parker call'd about briskly for Wine and Cakes, 'till the poor Countryman got so drunk he could scarce see. When Parker saw that, he ordered the Drawer to bring a Bill, which was thus, and was a very reasonable one.</p>
            <p>The BILL.</p>
            <p>For 3 Bottles of Pimponella Wine at 16 s. per Bottle.2 8 0</p>
            <p>For 1 Bottle of Cedrus Pono Mandange Domo Wine.1 10 6</p>
            <p>For 1 Bottle of Lacrymalis Chrystylla Campeachy Wine.1 5 0</p>
            <p>For one Pound of Capacacoow Cakes.1 1 9</p>
            <p>Sum Total-6 4 6</p>
            <p>A soon as the Countryman looked over this Bill, it made him a little sober:  says he, what Rogues are here! Six Pounds for two Hours drinking? s'bleed! I'll never pay it. Hush, says Parker, don't make yourself ridiculous before my Cousin, pay the Money, and I'll tell you how we'll order it by and by. But the Countryman still refusing, and the Lady pretending to be uneasy,  handed her out of the Room, and left  Friend B-, the Drawer, to deal with the Countryman, who swore, and tore, raved like a Madman: At last the Drawer</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174005070014"/>
            <p>brought up a Person with a Constable's Staff, which a little mollify'd him, who told him if he did not pay the Reckoning he must go to Prison, which surprized the Countryman to such a Degree, that he opened his Pouch, and told him down the Money; but when he enquired for his Friend Parker, he was not to be found.</p>
            <p>Parker and B - had for their Shares One Guinea and a Half a Piece, the rest was snack'd between the W - re and the B - d of the House.</p>
            <p>Parker got acquainted with a Woman of the Town, who used to dress herself in Man's Cloaths; and one Night Parker being in his Livery, meeting accidentally with this Lady, very gay dressed in Man's Cloaths, with a Toupee Wig on, a Sword by her Side, and a gold laced Hat under her Arm, she accosted him in the following Manner: Heyday! Joseph, where are you a going this Way, (which was in Fleet-street) when I sent you of an Errand to St. James's. Joseph stared at her like one Thunder-struck, as indeed he well very might, but she discovering herself, he asked her whither she was going in that Dress, who replied, to the Play house. Joseph accordingly desired he might attend as a Servant, which being agreed upon, he called a Chair, and strutted before his new Master to Coven Garden Theatre, when they came there, the pretended Gentleman fixed himself in a Side-Box, by N -, a noted Toast of the Town, who was very gay dressed with a handsome Gold Watch by her Side, who taking her for a Gentleman of Fortune, thought she had got a very good Gallant, after the Play was over, the pretended Gentleman invited the Lady to  with him, who very readily accepted the Invitation: As they were a coming out, the Gentleman's Man Joseph was ready at the Door, and was ordered to call a Couple of Chairs, bidding the Chairman carry them to a noted  near the Hay-Market: As soon as they  he ordered a very elegant Supper to be got, and Joseph was ordered to attend below till Supper was ready, and then to wait upon his Master at Table: Mean while Supper was dressing, Joseph stepped to an Apothecary's and bought Six-penny worth of Liquid Laudanum: And when he came back Supper being ready, the Cloth and Things were laid, and Joseph attending, and being behind the Lady's Back, he every Time she called for a Glass of Wine, put some Drops of Laudanum in unperceiv'd: As soon as Supper was over, the Lady perceiving herself to be very sleepy, asked her supposed Gallant if he would not go to Bed, which he consenting to, she began to undress herself very hastily, and went into Bed; she had not been there the Space of one Minute, before she fell fast asleep. As soon as the other found she was safe, she called Joseph up Stairs to consult what was to be done; Joseph examining her Pockets, found 5 Guineas and some Silver, and taking the Watch, he went down Stairs and desired to know what was to pay, and was answered 25 s. so paying the Reckoning, and giving the Waiter a Shilling, he ordered him to call a Chair for his Master, which he did, and the supposed Gentleman came down Stairs, and desired that they might not disturb the Lady who had been up all Night, and was gone to Bed, and he would be back again in two Hours Time; so getting into the Chair, Joseph ordered the Chairman to carry his Master to my Lord Palmerster's in St. James's-square, but before they got there, she ordered them to stop, and got out and went away with Joseph to a House near <placeName id="OA17400507-geo-67">

            <p>This Practice Joseph followed for upwards of a Year and a Half, and most of the Time he kept with his Companions aforementioned, but upon some Disgust or other they seperated, and Parker shifted for himself. Parker being thus left to shift for himself, used commonly to dress himself as a Gentleman's Servant, or a Tradesman with an Apron on, and used to go about in an Evening sometimes to one Shop, sometimes to another, and he had very nigh been detected in the following Manner. He one Day went to a Grocer's Shop, and after agreeing with the Person of the Shop for a Quarter of a Pound of his best Tea, and flinging down a good Guinea, asked for Change, which the Man was going to give, and just as he had changed the Guinea, Parker pretended to recollect that he had Silver enough, and asked for his Guinea again, at which the Man looked wishfully at him, and in a Surprize asked him if his Name was not Parker, which so confounded Parker, that he did not stay to give him an Answer, but snatched up his Guinea, and marched off with the utmost Precipitation.</p>
            <p>Parker whilst he followed this Employment, used every Day to shift his Dress, and disguise himself by blacking his Eye-brows, so that he might not be known if he was met in the Day Time, and great Success he had, for he has publickly said he has put off upwards of seven hundred bad Guineas within this Year and a half.</p>

Whilst they were upon him, Mitchell pretending to assist Mr. Lee, and take the other two off, found Means in the Scuffle to take his Watch and some Silver out of his Pocket, and when they had all three got what they could, they made off; but the Man recovering himself, and finding his Watch and Money gone, called out very lustily, Stop Thief! Upon which being closely pursued, they all three fled seperate Ways, and Sawney taking down a wrong Turning, where there was no Thorough-fare, when he found he could not get through, walked very leisurely back again, and just as he had got half Way up the Alley, the Pursuers cried, Here I see one go down this Turning, and immediately turning down, met Sawney, who had got up almost by this Time out of the Alley, when one of the Men laid hold on him, and presently several assisted him; Sawney at the same Time crying, What's the Matter, Gentlemen? What would you have? You see I am but just coming from visiting a Friend in this Place; but, notwithstanding, they said hold him fast, and some more of you go down and search at the End of the Alley, for they cannot get through; in the mean time they dragged him to a Magistrate, but he not being in the Way, Sawney was put for that Night in the Cage, but Taylor and Mitchell got clear off, and missing their Companions, Sawney at the usual Place of Rendezvous, they came over about One o'Clock in the Morning with Saws, in order to release their Friend Sawney, but being disturbed, and he having just Time enough to tell them the Circumstances how he was taken, they told him to persist in what he had said and they would get a Friend to appear for him in the Morning, and then he would be discharged, but if he offer'd to * Puff, they told him they would blow his Brains out, and as was observed before, they being disturbed by their Saws making too great a Noise, they was obliged to retreat, and going to their place where they usually &#8224; Fenced the Things which they got. Upon letting the &#8225; Fence have the &#8214; Scout for about One Guinea and a Half, which was worth about Five, he promised to assist them in getting off their Companion in the Morning. Now this Person liv'd in the Lane where Sawney run down. In the Morning he was carried before a Justice of the Peace, and Mr. Lee not taking upon him to swear (it being a very dark Night) to his Person, he was discharged upon J - J - nes's, which was the Fences Name, giving him a Character, and saying, he had just been at his House upon some Business that Night. As soon as he was discharged, he went in quest of his two Companions, and finding them, they made themselves very merry at a Boozing Ken, but they told Sawney, they had given the Fence, the Scout to appear for him, so they sunk him out of his Share in that Booty.</p>
