            <p>One Man, viz. <persName id="OA17360204n12-1">
                  <interp inst="OA17360204n12-1" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  <interp inst="OA17360204n12-1" type="surname" value="BULKER"/>
                  <interp inst="OA17360204n12-1" type="given" value="THOMAS"/>Thomas Bulker</persName>, was by the Jury found Guilty of Capital Crimes, and condemn'd to die.</p>
            <p>While under Sentence, they were instructed in the Christian Faith, how as Christians we are strictly bound to a new and holy Life, being early dedicated to God in Baptism, to deny ourselves to all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, to the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, and to obey the Laws of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ in every Thing.</p>
            <p>They were exhorted seriously to repent of all their Sins; to consider their Ways, and turn their Feet unto God's Testimonies; to cry incessantly unto God, that he who made them, might have Mercy upon them, for the Sake of his Anointed; to fit and dispose them for his heavenly Kingdom and Glory; to eradicate those vicious Habits which they had contracted, and which prov'd the Occasion of all those miserable Misfortunes, to which they were then subjected, and implant in their Souls all those gracious and virtuous Dispositions, which would render them amiable in the Sight of God, and prepare them for that never-ending Happiness and Bliss, in the full Enjoyment of God, World without End.</p>
            <p>I exhorted them to a diligent Preparation for the Sacrament of our Lord's-Supper, as the Apostles adviseth, But let a Man examine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup, I Cor. xi. 28. In this religious Ordinance, we are to look on Him, whom God hath set forth to be the Propitiation of our Sins, Rom. iii, 25. Even Jesus Christ, that Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sins of the World, Jo. i. 29.</p>
            <p>They were told, that whosoever comes to this Holy Table without an entire Hatred of every Sin, comes unworthily; and he that doth entirely hate all Sin, will resolve to forsake it; for forsaking, naturally follows Hatred, no Man willingly abides with a Thing or Person he hates. And therefore he that doth not so resolve, as that God the Searcher of Hearts may approve it as sincere, cannot be supposed to hate Sin, and so cannot be a worthy Receiver of that holy Sacrament. Therefore they were bound to try their Resolutions thoroughly, so as not to deceive themselves in them, which is to their own great Danger if they do; for it is certain, God cannot be deceived, and that none can gain Acceptation from him by any Thing, which is not perfectly hearty and sincere.</p>
            <p>When these and many like Exhortations were given, they attended in Chapel, behav'd gravely and se</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173602040005"/>
            <p>dately, comply'd with Prayers, and seemed very Devout and Serious, and attentive to Exhortations and Instructions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Campbel, while he was under Sentence, was very attentive to what I read to him. He fell into a very ill State of Health, under which he still Labours.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17360204n54-1" type="given" value="JOSEPH"/>Joseph Cole</persName>, of whom the Reader has already had some Account, was a young Fellow unhappy in his Family, as well as in his Courses; for he had an Uncle, one <persName id="OA17360204n54-2">

This Nephew <persName id="OA17360204n54-3">

                  <interp inst="OA17360204n54-3" type="given" value="JOSEPH"/>Joseph Cole</persName>, followed the same wretched Course; he had large Acquaintances among these miserable Creatures, and whatever End of the Town he was in, he knew where to find enough of them; to destroy his Time, his Health, and his Money.</p>
            <p>He had addicted himself for a considerable Time to these mischievous Courses; for but in February last, he escaped Death by impeaching four of his Companions, and was in great Hopes of saving himself now by the same Method; but it being demanded of him, How many he could impeach? he said only One, who was concerned with him in breaking open the House of Mr. Chamberlain, the very Fact for which he died; but he said, if they had but let him alone for a Night longer, he and his Associates were to have broke open the House of a Silver-Smith, and then he could have given Evidence against three or four.</p>
            <p>This is a melancholy Proof of the extream Depravity of human Nature, since it shews us, that Men are capable, first of leaguing themselves with others, to commit Facts the most abominable in their Nature; and secondly, have it in their Heads all the while to hang one another, while they are eating, drinking, and conversing together like Brothers.</p>
            <p>Exorbitant Expences led this poor Fellow to think of supporting himself by Robbery, and from the Instant that he had entered on that infamous Sort of Life, he gave a Loose to yet more</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173602040012"/>
            <p>exorbitant Expences; for it is the universal Practice of these miserable Men, to spend with a Prospect of Plunder, and to plunder with no other View than to spend; so that it is impossible for them to avoid that Fate which they deserve, since they are continually tempting it, and as it were, hourly running their Heads against the Gallows.</p>
            <p>Habit in these People ripens Want of Fear, and Want of Conscience, into horrible Audacity: This very Fellow when he was taken, had a couple of Iron Instruments discovered in his Room, of which being asked the Use? He said they were his Mills, and that with them he would undertake to open any Doors in England. On his Trial however he said that they were not his, but that they were Tools belonging to <persName id="OA17360204n59-1">

            <p>To pursue the Thread of this Man's Villainies any further, would be tedious and improper, inasmuch as they are particularly related by himself. All that can be drawn from this Recital, is this Memento, that too high an Expence, and the running into promiscuous Companies, are Things the most dangerous to the common Sort of People, and of Consequence they ought to be avoided and left off, from the View of this unpleasant Spectacle, whose Death, if it deters others, effectually answers the End of Justice.</p>

            <p>MY DEAR,</p>
            <p>THIS with my kind Love and Respects to you, is for to beg of you not to grieve you self upon the Account of my ignominious Death, nor never to take any Notice of them, that was the Reason of it; for why, if I had gone on in this Course of Life, I should have had more Sins to have answer'd for, and I should have committed more Robberies, and in Case of Opposition, Murder might have been done, and if I had been killed in committing a Robbery, I should not have had Time to have said, Lord have Mercy upon me, which would have been a sad Thing, for what would have become of me; and now thro' God's Blessing, I have had a long Time of Repentance, but too short for the great Work I had to do. I judge that one of the chief Causes that makes me afraid of Death is, because I look'd upon God as a most severe and merciless Judge, inflamed with Anger and Fury against me, and armed with Vengeance. When I should consider and acknowledge him to be a merciful Father, full of Compassion and Knaness for Mankind. Every Slave trembles at the Sight of his Lord: There is no Malefactor but is afraid to receive Sentence; then how can I, who am all sptted with Sin, and blacken'd with Crimes? Can I appear before that glorious Throne, That cau</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173602040017"/>
            <p>seth the Seraphims to cover their Faces with their Wings, Isaiah vi. How can I, that am but Stubble, subsist in the Presence of the God of Vengeance, who is a consuming Fire, Heb. x. If I had been afraid of a cruel and shamefull Death, I should have kept myself from an evil and prophane Life; for commonly as a Man's Life is, so is his Death.</p>
            <p>My Dear, pray mind this; you who are afraid to leave behind you, a desolate, afflicted, and comfortless Widow, come and learn this Lesson. To rely upon the Goodness and tender Compassions of the Father of Mercies, who never fails to comfort the Distressed in all Afflictions, and who is always near to them that calls upon him in their Troubles, ii. Cor. 2. Psa. 14. He favours the Widow to that Degree, that he calls himself, The Judge of the Widows, Psalm 18. That is the Protector of their Integrity and their Rights, and severe Revenger of their Wrongs, that they may suffer. Therefore God tells us in express Words, That he maintains the Widow, and Establisheth her Borders, Prov. 15. But I mean the wise Widows, who being left alone by their Husband's Dath, have their Confidence and Trust in God, continuing in Prayer Day and Night. So to God Almighty's Protection I commit you. Which is all from your unfortunate, but dying Husband.</p>

            <p>To the DRAWERS in the several TAVERNS in LONDON, and WEST-MINSTER.</p>
            <p>WHEN I consider the terrible Situation I am in, what Misfortunes I have brought upon myself, what Reflections upon others, I think it becomes me to do somewhat for the benefit of the Publick, to the End, that my Punishment may have a proper Effect, and deter others from treading such steps as have brought Ruin upon me. However careful the Masters of Taverns may be, to prevent young People who serve in their Houses, from having their Manners corrupted, in which Respect, I must take this Opportunity of declaring that none could be more so than the Master I serv'd; yet it will be simply impossible for them to hinder their receiving any ill Impressions by any other Method, than fortifying their Minds with right Principles, which may make them abhor such Measures as lead to any sort of Vice. If my Misfortunes may be allowed to have taught me Experience, I should be glad to be believed, when I say that nothing is more Ridiculous, at the same Time, that nothing can be more Fatal than for young Drawers to imagine they are to live like the Company they see, and enjoy the same Delights with those they serve, were they capable of understanding it; they ought to place their. Happiness in other Things, they ought to seek a Competency by Honest Industry, and as they</p>

            <p> Opportunities of observing what terri Havock, Debauchery and Extravagancies  in Men's Persons and Estates, they should  thence learn to shun and detest such a Course of Life. Instead of Plays and Gaming-Houses, instead of Country Journeys and House-Races, you would do well to employ your leisure Time in Reading profitable Books, or in some innocent Amusement; for as to exercise the usual Excuses for such Excursions, your Business requires so much, that it cannot be pretended, a strict Habit of Justice ought to be acquired by a scrupulous Niceness in the Affairs of your Masters; for if once you come to think Cheating a small Fault, or Fraud in any Degree excusable, you will quickly advance farther in the same unhappy Path, and come at last to Practices as bad as mine, tho' perhaps less dangerous in the Sight of Men; as I have no other View in this Cordial Advice than your God, and the disburthening my own Mind, so I hope it will be receiv'd as candidly as I intend it, and that you will listen to my earnest Intreaties, as well as vouchsafe me your hearty Prayers.</p>

            <p>GOOD PEOPLE,</p>
            <p>THE Law in adjudging me to a shameful and ignominious Death, and in making me a Publick Spectacle, as you see me this Day, intended not so much the Destruction of my Body, as the Reformation of your Minds; for tho', as a rotten Branch, it was become necessary as well as just, that I should be lopp'd off, for the Sake of preserving Peace in human Society; yet surely my Death is intended as an Example to deter others; and all who are Spectators of my End, are bound in Conscience to take Notice thereof, and consider it in that Light. The Allurements of wanton Women, and the noisy Pleasure of a drunken Life, first led me to think of supporting my Extravagances by Gaming; and that Recourse sailing me, as it does most Men, in the midst of Distraction and Despair, I conceived in my Mind, that fatal Resolution, which has brought me to this shameful Place. If I had employed a few Moments Time, in considering the Difference between a regular sober Life, and those lewd Scenes of false Joy, which I so earnestly coveted, and so eagerly pursued, I had avoided a long Train of Mischiefs, which for some Time past I have suffered, as well as escaped this Ignominious Period of it. If with Respect to my Character, my Relation, and my Person, the present Circumstances I am under are grievous and full of Shame, yet as I have had a competent Time to repent in, and the proper Means of bringing me to Repentance have been furnished, which otherwise perhaps I might never have had. I am reconcile to all the Evils I have undergone, and even to this last terrible one I am yet to undergoe. I trust that my temporal Afflictions will in some Measure, attone for my flagrant Offences; and that Almighty God will have Mercy on my Soul, thro' the Itercession of Jesus Christ his Son, which that it may come to pass, I humbly beg that you will join your Prayers to mine, and continue them as long as Life shall continue in me.</p>
