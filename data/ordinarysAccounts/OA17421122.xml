            <p>While under Sentence, they were exhorted diligently to consider what a great Work they had to do, to secure themselves an Interest in the Kingdom of Heaven, which shall never be taken from them; and more especially, since their Time was so short, to double their Diligence, in working out the great Work of their Souls Salvation, while it is called to day; their eternal Happiness or Misery depending upon the few remaining Moments.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174211220003"/>
            <p>Being young, and grosly ignorant, they were carefully instructed in the first element of Religion, that there is one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and Man; the Man Jesus Christ, who gave himself a Ransom for all, to be testified in due Time. 1 Tim. ii. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>The Viciousness of their Lives was also represented to them; how dreadful it is to depart from the true and living God, to trust in Vanities and Things of this World, to which they were wholly addicted; yet these Triffles could not in the least satisfy the Desires of an immortal Soul, which can acquiesce in nothing less than God Himself, who is the Author of our Being and Fountain of all our Mercies: And their whole Life having been nothing but a despising of God, and deviating from his Commandments and Ordinances, they were directed to turn the Bent of their Inclinations another Way, towards God and Christ, which as it is their Wisdom, much more is it their Interest so to do, as most agreeable to the Will of God, and most suitable to the rational Nature of Man.</p>
            <p>Theft and Robbery being the Crimes most of of them suffered for; the Evil of this great Sin was particularly represented to them; how it was contrary to all Laws divine and human; and consequently liable to the Penalty, both temporal or eternal, annex'd to such Laws; the evil of Theft (as we told them) appears by the Injustice thereof, in wronging our Neighbour of his Right, and Property, to which we have no Title or Claim, on which Account it is prohibited by the express Law of God, Thou shalt not steal; it is the Will of God, that Man who is made after his Image, should live in a regular and rational Way, agreeable to the Doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We are commanded by our Saviour to love all Men, to love our Neighbour as ourselves; but to rob and spoil them of their Goods and Property, is to devour and reduce them to Misery and Poverty, which is contrary to the Nature of God, who is good to all, whose Mercies are over all his Works, and his munificence extends to the righteous and the wicked, causing his Sun to enlighten the good and evil. And as to Highway Robberies, it was represented to them, they were next if not equal, to that most atrocious of all Sins and Crimes Murder, since in Case of the least Opposition, or resistance, they not only knock'd down, but kill'd and murther'd the Persons attack'd by them; as hath been frequently too often seen in the Streets and Neighbourhood of this City.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17421122n18-2" type="given" value="THOMAS"/>Thomas Homan</persName>, being convicted of Murther, it was represented to them, what a dreadful Thing it is to rob innocent Persons of their Lives in an unexpected Moment, and that it was most just with God to throw them into the Pit of Hell and everlasting Destruction on a sudden, for such barbarous Cruelty; the speciality of their Crimes was shewn them; the one, Homan, having murder'd an old, innoffensive Gentlewoman, his Neighbour, in a most cruel Manner, thinking to rob her of her Goods; the other, Bird, having, in a Way unparallel'd and unheard of, in a Hole, where there was not sufficient Air to breath in, thrust down twenty or thirty poor Women, taken off the Street, committed to his Care, many of whom were like to die, though by proper Care recover'd; but four of them, in that narrow confin'd Place, for want of Air, were actually stifled to death. For these most attrocious Crimes, they were exhorted to fly unto the Blood of Christ, which only can cleanse us from all Sin, to exercise in a lively Faith Christ's Merits and Intercession, and to repent deeply and sincerely of all their Sins, especially Murder, begging the Assistance of God's Grace and Holy Spirit, to enable them to work out their Salvation, and so to fit and dispose them for God's heavenly Kingdom and Glory.</p>

As this happen'd, the Right Honourable the Lord Carpenter was coming to Town from his Lordship's Country Seat, and Laurence having escaped being robb'd, rode directly up to his Lordship's Coach and related what had befallen him; upon which his Lordship was so kind as to order 2 or 3 Servants of his Retinue to pursue the Robber, which they very readily did, and overtook him at a Publick House by the Highway not far off, drinking a Pint of Beer.

            <p>While under Sentence, he was all the Time very sick and weak, and with great difficulty came up and down to Chapel; yet he never absented, but sometimes when very bad. He behaved well, and was very attentive to Prayers and Exhortations, so that we may hope he was a sincere penitent. He believed in Christ our only Saviour; repented of all his Sins, and died in Peace with all the World.</p>

            <p>him in a most cruel Manner with Ropes, Sticks, and whatever came to Hand; by which means he lived a most miserable and slavish Life, constantly exposed to the imminent Danger of his Life by such cruel Hardships and Blows.</p>
            <p>Living thus miserably, as they were careless of the Body, so as little did they mind the Soul of this unfortunate Creature; for seldom if ever did he go to Church, neither had he any Fear of God before his Eyes. His Master dying, John was put to his Shifts; his Mistress though inclining to keep up the Business, not being well capable to do it, was willing however to give up John's Indentures, but could not find a Master; whereupon, having nothing to do, John took himself to the Company of bad Women, which was the ready Way to his compleat Ruin, for he lived with a common Creature equally wicked as himself.</p>
            <p>In effect, in his natural Disposition, he was very wicked and perverse; for upon the Sunday before his Trial, he misbehaved in Chappel, and endeavoured to spit on the Pulpit and Desk; when I reproved him sharply for so vile a Miscarriage; he had the Impudence to deny the same, although I myself was witness to it.</p>
            <p>He was a most vicious and wicked Fellow, knowing nothing but what was evil, and averse to every Thing that is good, being associated with the vilest Gang of Thieves and Whores about <placeName id="OA17421122-geo-36">

            <p>Before this, he also confessed three or four Street-robberies; and before he died, five or six Days, being past all Hopes of Life, he confessed he could not tell the Number he was guilty of with these abandoned Wretches he had joined to; and as to petty Thefts and Larcenies, they were innumerable; he having been nothing but a common professed Thief and Robber from his Cradle, to the Time of his Apprehension for this Robbery, which brought him to the fatal Tree; though as for his unlawful Profits, the highest Prize he got was 20 Shillings at a Time, and very seldom so much.</p>
            <p>As to his Behaviour, he was a most insolent and wicked young Fellow; one of the chief Occasions of several little Disturbances and Disorders in Chappel, was the Lenity and mild Government in keeping him so long under Sentence, it rather hardens, than has any good Effects upon many of these obdurate and reprobate Creatures.</p>
            <p>For these Miscarriages, he and his wicked Associates were sharply reproved, and instructed to behave in a decent and Christian Manner: They fairly promised, but did not long keep his Resolutions, untill the Dead-Warrant came down; then Cooper and his Companions altered their Behaviour, and cryed most bitterly, declaring their hearty Grief and Sorrow for their Miscarriages.</p>
            <p>He was a miserable poor Creature, and had no body at all to come after him; as for his pretended Wife, she never came to ask for him.</p>
            <p>Upon Wednesday the 3d of November, Cooper and Squire, when they came up to the Afternoon Prayers, slipt down from Chappel towards the Master's Side, and skult about some of the Rooms till one of the Runners went after them and brought them back, and then they were confined to their Cells a short Time for their ill Behaviour.</p>

Richard's Wife, who before that came enquiring after him every Day, and was always loitering about the Doors of Newgate, bringing him any small Thing she could get for his Support) she was married to a Sailor bound to the East-Indies or China; this the Woman denied, but the Boy affirmed it for certain Truth to his own Knowledge; she came sometimes after that to see Richard, but did not seem to be much concern'd about him.</p>
            <p>This proved an unfortunate Family, having 3 Brothers all equally wicked, Thieves and Robbers, tho' the 4th or eldest Brother is a good, virtuous, regular Man.

To this, White replied, (if he is to be believ'd) don't kill him; but says Hagan, I will, and swore a great Oath; so he follow'd his Blows, till they left him for dead. This done, they searched him, but he had no Money, nor any thing of Value about him, not so much as a Handkerchief. White alledged as an Excuse, that they used him so cruelly, because he resisted them; how this Excuse will pass in the next World, let any one consider; however that be, the poor Man died in the Hospital, about a Fortnight or 3 Weeks after, of the Wounds he then received. After this, they went to B - and the Landlady said to Hagan, How came you to be so bloody? I am afraid you have been doing what you should not do. He said, they had not; if you have not, said she, it is very well. They told her they had no Money, so she trusted them; then they all went Home to Bed; he lived at this Time with his Father, and used to get in at the Window, so that his Father and Mother thought he was at home all Night.</p>

He was very desirous that this might be made Public, for the Service of honest People, to prevent their being robb'd by others in the same Manner; the Method they take is, to push in this Iron between the Shutters, to shove or wrench them back, then putting in a Hand and breaking a Pane of Glass, they with a Brass or other Wire, with a Hook at the End, can draw any thing out, which lies near the Window, that are not very large, without taking down a Shutter; this, he said, was very much owing to the Carpenter's Faults in not making the Shutters to fix close with proper Irons, and not well securing the Groves.</p>

Hinton desired that nobody would reflect upon his Sister, (who is the only Relation he had) for his untimely End, begged of God that he would change her Heart, and desired she also would reform her Life, especially to take Care not to prophane the Sabbath-Day, which he has been guilty of, and heartily repents of.</p>
            <p>The following Letter having been found in Homan's Pocket, after he was cut down and stript, and brought to Us, after the Publication of the Account of his Behaviour, we thought it better to subjoin it here, than to omit it entirely.</p>
            <p>My Dear!</p>
            <p>THIS with my kind Love to you, and the Child, and my Brothers and Sisters, desiring you not to fret your self about me, for I am a going to my Home. I trust in God I have made my Peace with him, and am willing to depart this sinful World for a Place of Rest; and I hope you will put your Trust in God likewise; he will have Mercy upon you, if you turn and repent, for he has promist Forgiveness to all Men, if they will but turn.</p>
            <p>From your loving Husband,</p>

            <p>" THE many notorious Offences I have committed against God and my Country, which " show me, tho' a young Man, to have been an " old Sinner; make it necessary for me, if I desire " my Repentance should be thought sincere, to testify my sincere Sorrow for the same; and warn " all Persons of my Age, to refrain from the same " Evil Courses; if they wou'd avoid the like untimely End, and not fill the Hearts of their " Parents, and Relations with Shame and Anguish.</p>
            <p>" O! my dear Countrymen, did you know the " Pangs I now feel, you wou'd take Care  " fall into the same Calamity, as I hope  " being desirous of being the last </p>

            <p>&#8220; such an ignominious End. It wou'd indeed be a &#8220; great Comfort to me, in my Dying Moments; &#8220; could I have any Reason to believe my Sufferings &#8220; wou'd be of Advantage to you, and I hope it &#8220; will deter you from splitting upon the same Rock &#8220; as I have done.</p>
            <p>&#8220; For the rest, I acknowledge the Justice of my &#8220; Sentence, and am even Thankful to Heaven, for &#8220; taking me off in this manner, because otherwise, &#8220; in all probability, I should have persisted still in &#8220; the same evil Courses, 'till I had dropt unawaken'd &#8220; and Impenitent into the Devil's Arms, doom'd ever &#8220; to remain with him in everlasting Flames. At &#8220; present, thank God, the Case is not so, but I &#8220; depart this Life with great hopes of Mercy from &#8220; an all gracious God, thro' the Merits of a Dying &#8220; Saviour, who is ready to receive all who truly &#8220; turn unto him, even at the last Moment.</p>
            <p>&#8220; Good People, I have how but few Moments &#8220; longer to live, during which I earnestly desire &#8220; your fervent Prayers for my poor Soul; especially, &#8220; in those bitter Agonies, when I shall be unable &#8220; to Pray for myself. May Heaven Guard, and &#8220; Direct you ALL, and may the Lord Jesus, in &#8220; whose Merits alone I trust for my eternal Well-fare receive my sinful Soul. Amen.</p>
