            THE INTRODUCTION.</p>
            <p>CURIOSITY is one of the chief characteristicks of Britons; the people of every part of this island, like the Athenians of old, spending most of their time either in relating, or listening to some new transaction.</p>
            <p>Being now to enter upon a new scene of action, it will, I suppose, be expected, especially by the inquisitive inhabitants of this famous Metropolis; that I should say something by way of Preface, on this melancholy occasion.</p>
            <p>The tragedies of this week will afford matter of speculation for ages to come; and the Rebels at Kennington-Common, as well as the Malefactors at Tyburn, may give lessons to posterity.</p>
            <p>Truly sorry I am, that there should be any occasion for these sad examples of justice; but the extreme wickedness</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174608010003"/>
            <p>
            INTRODUCTION.</p>
            <p>of the age calls aloud for them: And executions in the state are frequently as necessary, for the welfare and security of the body politick, as bleeding for the preservation of the life of man: 'Tis certain that no government cou'd subsist long, in case a lawless liberty, or rather licentiousness, were allow'd, and no punishments inflicted on bold offenders: It is requisite that some sort of criminals should suffer death, as examples to deter others; and the justice as well as lenity of the government we live under, is manifest, in its inflicting punishments proportionable to the offences committed.</p>
            <p>The prisoners will be daily and constantly attended by me, pursuant to the new order of my most worthy patrons, the Right Honourable the Lord-Mayor, and Court of Aldermen, and from time to time instructed in their duties, both from the pulpit, and in private conversation; nevertheless my account of them, for the future, will not be swell'd with any heads of sermons, nor shall family affairs ever be divulg'd.</p>
            <p>The publick may therefore depend upon having a plain, concise, and ingenuous narrative of these unhappy objects, and almost in their own words; with such discoveries as may be of service to particular persons, or of general use to mankind.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the introduction, which I presume, will not be thought improper at this juncture: And as I mean well, I hope, that this first attempt to describe low life in affliction, will be receiv'd by the publick, with candour and good nature.</p>

            <p>IT has been too often the custom of writers, to foist on the publick stories which may appear diverting or surprizing, in order to amuse or entertain their readers without any regard either to truth or justice, which I here declare once for all shall never be my method; and tho' some of the following relations may appear dry and insipid, yet they will appear true, and as they were actually taken from the mouths of the persons themselves, who (as dying men) could have no interest in declaring falshoods; I shall give them as near as possible in the manner they were related, andin the order of time they were committed.</p>
            <p>And not withstanding these robberies are forty-three in number, they were all committed in so short a space of time, as from the 5th of January last to the 22d of May, not by the whole seven together, but sometimes by three of them, at other times four, and at some others two; but in general they robbed three in a company.</p>
            <p>I. The very first time of turning out (as they term it) was the 5th of January last, when three of them only set out together, and after rambling about for some time, about eight at night, between Pancras and Kentish-town, they met a man, whom they attacked, and demanded his money, he immediately delivered what he had, which was only one shilling in silver, and three penny worth of halfpence; they would have taken his coat which was a pretty good one, but he pleading that he was only a poor carpenter, they desisted stripping him, telling him that it being their first robbery he might escape, but that the next person they attacked should pay for it.</p>
            <p>II. The next robbery they committed was two nights following, viz. January the 7th, on a poor man in the Lock-fields, from whom they took only one shilling, it being all he had.</p>
            <p>III. As they were now set in, they determined not to be idle, and accordingly the very next night, Jan. the 8th, they set out again, and travelled a great deal of ground to very little purpose, till they came into the Lock-fields, where they attacked a man, and took from him only three shillings.</p>
            <p>IV. Meeting with very little success they almost determined to give it up, but resolved however to attempt it once more, and accordingly they went the next evening, Jan. the 9th, to Lock-fields again, where they met two men, from whom they took ten shillings.</p>
            <p>V. As they every night got something, tho' only trifles, they thought the Lockfields still to be their best place of resort, and accordingly went there again the following evening, Jan. the 10th, where they waited a long time without any prize, till at length a man coming along, they stepped up to him and demanded his money, he gave them seven shillings, and they walked off.</p>
            <p>VI. They went out several nights afterwards and met with no booty at all, till Jan. the 18th, between Deptford road and Peckham, they perceived a man whom they thought for their purpose, and accordingly saluted him in the usual Term of stand and deliver your money, and took from him seven shillings.</p>
            <p>The following robbery was committed by three of the above soldiers, as they have since confessed, who declared they never saw <persName id="OA17460801n58-1">

            <p>VII. The 24th of Jan. three of them set out together to seek their prey, and after strolling about for some time, about eight o'clock at night, they met between Tottenham court and Mother Red-cap's two men and a woman (which since appears to be one Mr. Morris and his wife, and one Mr. Ashborn) who had been to Mother Red-cap's to eat pig; it was one field from Tottenham-court towards Mother Red-cap's, one of the soldiers jostled Mr. Morris between the posts as he was coming through, on his asking what he wanted, the soldier clapping a pistol to his breast, answered, your money; to which Marris replied, he had none; the soldier told him he could not take his word but must search him, and accordingly took from him eight shillings and a watch key; Mr. Morris begged for his watch key again, but the soldier said, no d - n him he would have his watch also, and accordingly took it out of his pocket; in the mean time, another of the soldiers going to attack Mrs. Morris,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174608010011"/>
            <p>she cried out, and her husband hoisted her over a bank to make her escape; nevertheless, the soldier seized hold of her cloak and got it away; the third held a pistol to Mr. Ashborn's breast, and demanded his money; but Mr. Ashborn refused to deliver, and defended himself with his stick till the woman's cries raised some people at Tottenham-court, and the soldiers thought proper to retire with what booty they had got, and he escaped being robbed: The people from Tottenham-court pursuing the soldiers, who got clear off, seized on one <persName id="OA17460801n59-1">

            <p>VIII. The very same evening they attacked two young men between Mother Red-cap's and Tottenham-court road, from whom they took three shillings and some keys, they begged for their keys again, saying they were apprentices, and they returned them.</p>
            <p>IX. The 26th of Jan, three of them set out towards Camberwell, and in the road between Newington and that town, met two men whom they attacked and demanded their money, they gave them nine shillings, a knife, and a tobacco box; but immediately one of the men made a blow at one of the soldiers and knocked him down, on which ensued a very smart engagement, and 'twas with great difficulty they made their escape; the gentlemen they attacked being very stout, and men of courage, they own that one of their companions had liked to have been taken, being deserted by the other two, but he made shift to fling one of the gentlemen into a ditch, and throw the other cross a rail on his head, and made off.</p>
            <p>X. This last affair occasioned high words as well as blows among themselves, and they began to fear each other, Impeaching now was all the cry, however, after a few days it blew over; and Jan. 31st they went out again, and in the road between Newington and Camberwell, robb'd a Man of six shillings.</p>
            <p>XI. The next evening, Feb. 1st, they took the same road, and near the same place robbed another man of one shilling and sixpence, and tho' they travelled about for some hours after that, they met with no other prey that night.</p>
            <p>XII. For several days after they went together on the same day, but February 8th, they met in the Lock-fields with three Sailors whom they made stand, and after searching them found no money, only three pieces of silver foreign coin, which they took from them and made off.</p>
            <p>XIII. Three of them met with two men, Feb. 11. in the Lock-fields, and took from them a silver watch, a pair of bristol-stone buttons, and one penny; before they had got the watch, they were going to strip one of them of his coat, in the doing which they perceived his watch fix'd under his left arm, which they took, and left him his coat, telling him, his watch had redeem'd his garment.</p>

Mr. B - n hearing that the soldier who turn'd evidence, had put this robbery among the rest in his confession, came to him and questioned him, how and in what manner they robb'd him, which he described to him, and also what words past, and what they took from him, viz. a silver watch, and a pound of tobacco, which he said was perriwigcut tobacco; Mr. B - n not yet satisfied prevailed on the governor of Tothill-fields Bridewell, to admit the evidence under a proper guard to go to the place where the robbery was committed, and shew him the spot where they met, and how they proceeded, which he did, and Mr. B - n was convinced.</p>

            <p>XV. The next robbery they committed, was Feb. 21st last; they met a man between Newington and Camberwell, from whom they took two great coats, one off his back, and t'other hanging over his arm, and one shilling and six-pence.</p>
            <p>XVI. They met a man, Feb. 27th last, between Pancras and Kentish-town, whom they saluted with stand and deliver; from whom they took thirty shillings in silver and nine shillings in halfpence; by the weight of the bag they imagined they had gotten a very large booty, and proceeded joyfully to Town; but when they came to examine the hig and find the copper, they were greatly disappointed.</p>
            <p>XVII. This last booty served them sometime, before they turn'd out again; but when it was all gone they were determined to seek a fresh supply, accordingly March 5. they set forth again in hopes of more plunder, and just between <placeName id="OA17460801-geo-41">

            <p>XXIV. The next night of their adventuring, was March 14th, when they attack'd a man between Pancras and Mother Red-cap's, from whom they took a coat, a pair of silver shoe-buckles, eighteen shillings and two silk handkerchiefs.</p>

After this last robbery they laid still for some time, being some of them obliged to be on duty, or otherwise employ'd; however, being now become proficients, they could not forget their old trade, and therefore three of them set out March 31st, being Easter-monday, in search of fresh adventures, and between <placeName id="OA17460801-geo-42">

B.</p>
            <p>N. B. This was one of the robberies on which they were convicted.</p>
            <p>This robbery proved fatal to them, for next day going to a house they frequented in Fleet-lane, they sent a woman with the two pair of shoe-buckles and one pair of kneebuckles, to Mr. Barnes's shop near Ludgate to sell; Mr. Barnes having received a warning from the goldsmiths company to stop such things if they were offered, got a constable, and went with the woman to Fleet-lane, where he secured one of them, which greatly alarmed the rest, who began to be tearful of each other; at length one of them voluntarily went before Justice Fraser, made himself an evidence, and by his direction the others were taken, brought to their trials at the Old Bailey, and deservedly executed.</p>
            <p>The pistols, or rather imitation of pistols they robbed with, they made themselves, out of three muskets which they stole from the Tilt-yard guard-room: They cut off the stock and butt end with a hand-saw, and cut off the brass with a three square file, took the barrells out of the stocks, cut them to a proper length, and made them pistol fashion; what remained of the muskets they sold to their old chapman Mr. - in the Old Bailey, who generally bought during the course of their robberies, whatever they brought him.</p>
            <p>The behaviour of these miserable criminals has been so very extraordinary, during the whole time that has been allowed them to prepare for death, that I must not omit some further remarks concerning it.</p>

            <p>Their knowledge of divine things was small indeed, yet their hearts seemed to be thoroughly touched and enflamed with what they heard both at chappel and in private discourse; for they often sighed, and wept, and entreated me to pray for them. The blessed sacrament of our Lord's supper, was thrice administred to them and others whowere religiously disposed, at which, their devotions were devout and grave. On Sunday morning, five only of those under sentence received it, but on Wednesday morning, and the morning of their execution, they all took the sacrament with others in the prison both debtors and felons.</p>

            . At Tyburn they behaved as true penitents, with seriousness and devotion.</p>
            <p>BIRD was very loth to confess, but at last own'd the robbery for which he died, and that he had committed many others, but strenuously insisted upon not altering the pieces, as sworn against him by the evidence, and that he had been acquainted with Bray, but a little while.</p>
            <p>THOMAS said this was his birth-day, and a blessed day to him. He, Humphreys, and the rest declared their ruin was chiefly owing to drunkenness, sabbath-breaking, and leud women.</p>
            <p>* BIRD and SHORT acknowledg'd their attempt of breaking the goal, the day-before their execution, and thought themselves excusable in trying to escape, because, as they term'd it, life is sweet.</p>
            <p>* They attempted to break their way through the cells, by picking a large quantity of bricks out of the wall, which was found out by one of the keepers who was going round the cells, as is customary for them to do, when the prisoners are gone to chappel; and perceiving some rubbish on the ground, he looked a little more narrowly about, perceived a very large hole in the wall which they had artfully covered with their coats; and being taxed with it when they came from chappel, they confessed their design, and were directly separated, they having been indulged before with being together on account of one reading to the other, who could not read.</p>
            <p>BRUCE declar'd his innocency to the last moment.</p>
            <p>SHORT, THOMAS, HUMPHREYS, JENNINGS, and STEPHENS, ingenuously adher'd to their former confessions, said, they had nothing more to add, and were urgent in pressing Bird to confess.</p>
            <p>They all went off, calling, with great servour, on the Lord to have mercy on their souls.</p>
