From the evidence of Mrs. Ashby it appeared that she also had been shamefully and cruelly treated by this convict, having the very same night broke open her place, hauled her into the street, turned her clothes over her head, and whipped her like a child, and then stabbing her in the temple with a penknife, left her for dead, exposed half-naked in the street; threatening to burn all the b - s in one bone-fire.</p>

            <p>charged against him in the murder of the deceased was, that he held the door in one hand partly opened and a poker in the other, while his wife made a push under his arm: though it was favourably presumed, that they being in the dark, he might not know his wife had got a knife or any like dangerous weapon in her hand.</p>
            <p>When first visited after conviction, she was full of resentment against Mrs. Ashby, (or Ashley, as she called her) saying she never could forgive her. The account she gave of the occasion of this unhappy event was to this purpose, that Mrs. Ashley, lodging in the same house with her, a widow, was freely admitted to several conveniences in her room, as the use of her fire, boiling water, and the like; then on some misbehaviour and disgust being excluded from these benefits, she became spightful to her and her children, picked quarrels with them, and abused them from day to day, so that they had taken out warrants against each other.

Returning home at night, she found herself bolted out of the house by this Mrs. Ashley, and calling for one of her children to unbolt the street-door, the child was beat and hurt by the said Mrs. Ashley before she could get at the door to unbolt it: this incensed the mother; and when she got in at the door, meeting Mrs. Ashley, who, she says, was in liquor, Ashley fell upon her with both hands, while Levingstone giving way, she sell over the threshold on the stones, and cut herself in the head: this gave occasion to her swearing against Levingstone, that she wounded her in the head with a knife: but Levingstone denied this, and declared as a dying woman, she had no knife; in like manner she solemnly denied that she ever threatened to set fire to the house, and burn the neighbours.</p>

She lately had three children, the eldest about twelve years of age; but one of them, as she pleaded on her trial, was killed by the stroke of a brick-bat thrown into their window in the riot, this she asserted to be done before the mortal wound was given; but the witnesses on the trial proved it could not be done, nor any violence used, till after the murder of Dove, when the mob grew outrageous. Being questioned about the weapon with which she stabbed the deceased, she declared she knew not whether she had a knife or no, because of the passion she was in, on account of her door being broke open; which she said was done, to the bigness of a small pannel before the stroke was given. But this is also disproved by the evidence on trial.</p>
            <p>At this first visit she was earnestly exhorted to a sincere and humble confession of her crime, and an hearty repentance for this and all her other sins, as ever she hoped for mercy. Proper prayers were used with her and pointed out to her to be constantly and fervently used in the cell; together with the reading of some psalms and portions of scripture, for her direction and comfort; for I found she could read, professed herself a Protestant of the established church, and was not void of a good understanding and strong affections for her husband and children, though clouded with violent passions.</p>
            <p>On the second visit, some few hours after, and also on the next day, she was much more calm, humble, and resigned; and farther, to my great satisfaction, declared she would die in charity with all the world, and particularly with her prosecutors, and that she hoped and prayed for that penitent and contrite heart which should not be rejected and despised.</p>
            <p>The proper psalms read on this occasion for her, and some few more of the convicts, who were now ready to attend, were, the 51st, 86th, 88th, and 90th; the first lesson Gen. 9. the second lesson Matt. 18. from each of which some portions were selected, explained, and applied to them. And surely your blood of your lives will I require. Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man, Gen. 9. 5, 6. Who else beside the Maker and Judge of all men, could with truth and authority declare this? and to whom can a sinner fly for propitiating mercy and pardon, but to the same creator of all things, and judge of all men. Wash me throughly from my wickedness, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my faults: and my sin is ever before me. Turn thy face from</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176310120005"/>
            <p>my sins; and put out all my misdeeds. Make me a clean heart, O God: and renew a right spirit within me. The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit. Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God! Ps. li. Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. The Son of man is come to save that which was lost, Matt. xviii. 3. 11. His Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors. So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses. All this she heard with deep attention and humiliation. Another female convict being present, was so affected, that she fell down in a fainting fit more than once during the service. This latter being now respited, 'tis hoped she never will forget the anguish of conviction, and a spirit wounded with guilt, nor relapse into any bad course for the future.</p>
            <p>On Sunday morning, Sept. 18, they were instructed in the nature, institution, and benefits of the holy communion, and a due preparation for it. Then followed the morning service, with select psalms, lessons, and a sermon; the psalms were vi, xxxii and xxxviii. first lesson Ezek. ii. second lesson Matt. xxv. In the evening service Ps. xxv. cii. cxlii. cxliii. first lesson Isa. liii. second lesson 1 Pet. ii.</p>
            <p>By this time Levingstone seemed greatly changed for the better, and there was a great calm in her soul. She was permitted to see her husband in the chapel after divine service; and after she returned down into the press-yard, her two children, the one about thirteen, the other about nine, were admitted to take leave of her there; they stayed not a quarter of an hour; they were all in tears: it was a very affecting scene. She could eat little or nothing this day, and yet was well supported in the chapel at her duty; behaving herself with firmness and composure. While she was going down from the chapel, she said, she was not so violent in her temper as reported, but had great provocation from the ungrateful behaviour of her neighbour, the widow Ashly, to whom she had been very kind and obliging for several weeks. She prayed for her forgiveness, promised to prepare for the holy sacrament, and begged she might have a candle all night, because she knew she could not sleep.</p>
            <p>The Morning of Execution.</p>
            <p>Sept. 19.</p>
            <p>I Was at the prison twenty minutes before seven, and admitted at seven, when the prisoner was brought down from her cell in a very calm and resigned temper, in which they told me she had continued ever since I left her. She said, though she had no candle to read by after nine last night, (according to a late necessary regulation) yet she had prayed in her heart. When she went up to chapel, she said, she had nothing farther to confess, but joined in some proper prayers for the pardon of her crime, and in the litany; and then being questioned, expressed her preparedness and desire to receive the holy sacrament. This morning she wept and sobb'd most of the time of prayers; then being more composed, she devoutly received the holy comunion: after which a good book was put into her hands, to employ her in the way; reminding her to cherish that blessing which she had now received. She asked, if she was to have any more prayers, to which it was answered, that I should meet her at the place; she seemed pleased. She was taken down from the chapel soon after eight. But the cart not being yet come, she continued very calm in the press-yard, making good use of her book, both here and in the way. She was carried out before nine, when several of her acquaintance met her at the outer door, to see her, and take their last farewel; which they did with tears and lamentation, while she spoke to them with remarkable composure, and comforted them, saying, she was easy, resigned, and willing to die. I found her in the same temper at the place of execution, a little before ten; and while the executioner prepared to tie her up, she looked about, and desired to be prayed for again by the minister. This was complied with, the people joining in prayer at her request. She desired to warn all people to live in love and peace with their neighbours, and to avoid strife and contention. She declared, she had no malice against the deceased, for she had never seen him before to her knowledge, nor could be sure what weapon she had in her hand, because of the confusion they were in, by being disturbed, and called out of bed.</p>
            <p>She joined in prayers of charity, expressing her reconciliation to, and forgiveness of her pro</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176310120006"/>
            <p>secutors, and all who had provoked her. She added at last, she hoped the world would not reflect on her honest husband, and the poor children. Having given her a final blessing, we parted; and she suffered about half an hour after ten.</p>

When exhorted, as he frequently was, to confess and give all possible satisfaction in this or any other wrong which he was conscious of, he declared he never wronged any one since his return home; and as to the watch for which he was transported, he was innocent of that also: he was earnestly and solemnly warned against this dangerous self-deceit, yet he talked on in the same strain after he found himself included in the death-warrant, only adding that " he confessed his " sins to God, and made his peace with him," little considering or less regarding what God declares, that there is no peace to the wicked. And are not they in that number and character, who, though publicly and notoriously convicted by the judgment of God and their country, persist in an obdurate denial of their guilt, incapable of being persuaded or convinced that they are obliged to give any sort of satisfaction for their private or public wrongs and offences, by an humble, sincere and particular confession of injuries, and begging pardon of the injured? how small the satisfaction! which is all they generally have in their power, and therefore that little is all that can be now required; and yet that little, through pride or stubbornness or false shame, they will not give: this surely is a fatal error! which though frequently refuted and fully exposed to these dying criminals and in these papers, yet too many will persist to rush blindfold upon it into eternity; and their survivors praise their proceeding, pursue their example, and bolster themselves up in the same opinion. But alas! how vain even as to this world? their misdeeds are generally known and brought to light, in a way not to the aid or advantage of their penitence and peace, but to the indelible shame and reproach of their hardness and impenitence! This criminal being thus plainly and earnestly warned, was left to go on in his own way; refusing him no means of grace, as he took all consequences on himself.</p>

Ay! said the sailor; I should take him up with pleasure. On this Hawes made a low bow to the pretended gentleman, and asked him how he came off t'other night? he answered, he lost a hundred and fifty pound, but did not value that: this brought on conversation: the sailor offered to bett twenty pound. I'll take you at no less than two hundred. Hawes said, (clapping him on the shoulder) come, I'll go your halves; pulled out his purse and threw it on the table. The sailor did the like; they knowing he had about half that sum with him. The sailor cut, looked and saw a tray: he dropt down in a swoon. The gang under pretence of carrying him out for air, lifted him over the garden-wall, dropt him, and went off together. The person to whom he related this exploit in his cell, a day or two before he suffered, observed to him this was a great thing! a brave booty! He replied, " I " have often touched two or three hundred at " a time. I once did one over for seven hundred pound."</p>
            <p>It was observed of him he was not given to liquor, always sober whether in gaol or out, capable of outwitting his prey. He had often practised on the farmers at <placeName id="OA17631012-geo-60">

            <p>He also said, he was receiver and fence to the gang; that he sometimes gave eighty-pound for an India-bond of an hundred, and that he once burnt one of that value.</p>
            <p>As he could not read himself, he had a prisoner (one of the fines as they are called) to read to him in the cell, for some hours in each day before he suffered: this being done at his own request, was a symptom of his desire to be improved by any means, for he did also daily attend the chapel. On enquiring into his temper and behaviour in the cell, I was told he was desirous of hearing the New-Testament read, and particularly those parts to which I directed them, and also joined in prayers; that he now consented to forgive his prosecutors, particularly Mr. B - n the baker, against whom he was at first most strongly prejudiced; that he wished he had known so much of religion before as he now did, and where he to live over again, he would be quite another man; but it was now too late: however he had strong presumptive hopes of his salvation, though intractable and headstrong, and would take his own measures to obtain it.</p>

            <p>The scheme of this most dangerous and detestable kind of criminal appears in the evidence given on his trial, in its proper colours; such as it is scarce possible to read or review without indignation and abhorrence of the crime; and an honest satisfaction in the detection, conviction, and punishment of it. A crime consisting in a continued course of aggravated robberies, perpetrated under the terror of an accusation more shocking to an honest mind than bludgeon, knife, or pistol; an accusation however which one would think an honest mind, consciously brave and fortified with its own integrity would not give way to, but defy; daring to meet and unmask the black infernal calumny: such one would resolve should be their own conduct in such a conflict, and heartily recommend it to all honest men, to the confusion of the false accuser: as on the one hand a caution against the manner of proceeding of these lurking miscreants cannot be too public; so neither on the other can sufficient care be employed to detect and punish by proper persons and legal means, that real offence which more than once has drawn down the signal vengeance of heaven on cities and regions stained with so detestable a sin, against nature and the all-wise and most powerful Author of nature, who will by no means acquit the guilty.</p>
            <p>When the criminals were visited after conviction, October 18, Brown made himself known to me with great anguish and many tears, as one who had been formerly under my care in the same situation. It was some time before I could recollect or recover the least remembrance of him. He bewailed and bitterly lamented his lot, expressing a kind of despair of escaping death at best, but that he should be content and patiently submit to that, if he might find mercy for his soul. On enquiring into his charge, and finding it of the same horrid nature with that for which he was to die before, I could not but express my astonishment mixt with deep concern to see him taken in the same snare a second time: demanding of him how he could relapse after so great a deliverance, and such professions as he made? he again burst into tears, and said, (with what truth he best knew) that he had taken care to the best of his power to live honestly, had a general good character in the <rs id="OA17631012-occupation-33" type="occupation">army</rs>

            <p>By these accounts he would give us to understand that he tried every method to get his bread honestly, but was disappointed and thrown into distress, and the way of temptation by this hard treatment he met with; insomuch that he usually told his story in a most piteous manner, with many tears, like a child under correction; expressing his fears that there was no mercy for him in this world, and praying for the forgiveness of his sins; for which he constantly frequented the chappel, and had proper books lent him to be used in his cell. But now towards the end of the first week after his conviction he began to flatter himself with some faint hopes that his life might be saved, by means of the only friend he could think of capable of interposing for him, the M - ss of G - y; he intreated that a petition might be signed in his behalf; in answer to which, when reminded how greatly and how justly incensed all that knew his case were against him, and that his plan was most dangerons and detestable to every honest man, he endeavoured to alleviate his case, by saying, that he never accused any but such as first offered indecencies to him: that the prosecutor had not only done so but sworn falsely that he robbed him of his buckles, whereas he carried them home in his shoes;</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176310120012"/>
            <p>when I assured him with a proper resentment, that no mortal would believe one word of this, he insisted on the truth of both these assertions as a dying man; adding, that he well knew the consequence if he should now be false and insincere; and though this point of insisting on so base a calumny was laboured with him from first to last by every argument that could be urged from hopes and fears, from the aggravation of his guilt, and binding it on his soul for ever; by the assistance of prudent and pious friends who went with me to visit him, yet he never gave it up; so that we were obliged to leave him in possession of this millstone about his neck, if indeed it were a falsehood, and to prove it so, he was often reminded that every proof and every probability was against him in the two cases he was convicted for. On his part he asserted that his only crime consisted in compounding the matter with persons of this cast, and not bringing them to justice. He owned he had made a practice of this, which was taught him by some of his old fellow-soldiers whom he named, with whom he haunted the places and times which that sort of people call the market; and as he appealed to the highest tribunal for the truth of what he said, to that we must refer him.</p>
            <p>In other respects he behaved more hopefully, confessing with tears the Sunday before he suffered, an act of theft he was privy to, viz. the stealing of some clothes out of a box in an apartment where he lodged, and having a part of the money they were sold for.</p>
            <p>The same morning when at my first entrance he was asked as usual, How are you? He answered: Very well in health; that he was easy and resigned in his mind, willing to die, and persuaded he should be a rich man and very happy on Wednesday next. This was his expression. When warned again to look well that he was on a sure foundation of truth and sincerity, which we and the world in general were very doubtful and much afraid of, he answered, the more he suffered and the worse he was treated here, the better he hoped to fare hereafter. He appeared very anxious to be forgiven by all others whom he had injured; particularly his two wives, who, he said, had visited him, and forgiven him a day or two before he suffered.</p>

He gave me the preceding confession the day he suffered, when he received the sacrament. He was about forty years of age, and said he was acquainted with the gang mentioned in his trial, about three years. He named them, and gave some particular account of them; which is not here published, in hopes they will be warned to reform and quit their had practices, not only by his fate, but by their own imminent dangers, which they have hitherto escaped, lest a worse lot befal them; as they have now fresh and repeated proofs that frauds, forgeries, and perjuries are crying sins, which sooner or later will provoke justice to avenge them.</p>
            <p>Reviewing and seriously reflecting on the cases of several criminals in the present execution, one can scarce avoid seeing the adorable rectitude of the divine judgments; with astonishment at the depth of them! the forbearance and long-suffering of almighty Power and goodness, intermixed with examples in this present life sufficient to ascertain the full and final completion of his word, his threats and promises, in the future. The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, and transgression, and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. In the same net which they hid privily is their own foot taken. As for such as turn back unto their own wickedness, the Lord shall lead them forth with the evil-doers: - But peace shall be upon Israel.</p>

Each of them was asked before the communion was administered whether he had any thing more to open? to which they answered in the negative: after which I was well informed by one to whom Smith had owned it, that this same certificate was written for him by Barlow before his trial; this person would have Smith to confess it to the minister now at the last, and when he could not prevail, blamed him for his obstinacy. The service in the chapel being ended, as they returned down into the Press-Yard, <persName id="OA17631012n77-3">

            <p>At the place of execution, Hawes was again asked in a tender manner whether he was not sorry that he had given me a false account of the certificate; he answered sternly and hardily, that he had told me nothing but truth; and that he had confessed his sins to God, and made his peace. I only replied, this is no time to dispute or disturb you or myself. He had acknowledged to the same to whom he confessed this imposture, that he had been very wicked from his early days, guilty of every crime except murder.</p>
            <p>Brown was very fervent in prayers, Smith seemed and affected to be unmoved and undaunted, scarce changing his countenance, except that when he was tied up he</p>

            <p>seemed to turn pale, but soon recovered. It was told me that during the few minutes he was in his cell to shift himself, between his leaving the chapel and having his irons knocked off, he acted over the last moments of his execution with much unconcern, pulling his cap down over his face, saying, " thus will it be in less than two hours hence, then it will be quickly over with me; after which I shall take an airing in a hearse," &amp;c. Such was his dreadful amusement, instead of private and mental prayer for a happy change and safe deliverance in the last decisive moment. Hardness is too oft the parent of presumption. We could scarce keep his attention fixed to prayers even at the place; but he would observe what passed among the surrounding croud.</p>
            <p>Barlow seemed languid and dejected, having been very sickly in the cell; he said little, except " that he hoped all good people would take warning by him, and avoid bad company and connections."</p>
            <p>Madge was very quiet and attentive during prayer, and had wept much when brought to be tied up.</p>
            <p>The other four of the church of Rome minded their own prayers: Brown handed down a letter to a friend, who stood near to take charge of his body; and in hopes it might be a warning to unwarry youth, has indulged the public with the annexed copy of it.</p>

            <p>In proof of this, the first witness, <persName id="OA17631012n90-1">
                  <interp inst="OA17631012n90-1" type="gender" value="male"/>

                  <interp inst="OA17631012n90-1" type="given" value="ADAM"/>Adam Robinson</persName>, being a friend and countryman to the prisoner, deposed that he came to visit him and had dined or supped with him this day at a late hour on some rabbits, one of which was laid by for the wife, against her return from selling her milk; soon after which she quarrelled with her husband, used him ill, strnck him, and was much in fault: while they were quarrelling in the passage, or soon after, <persName id="OA17631012n90-2">
                  <interp inst="OA17631012n90-2" type="gender" value="male"/>

                  <interp inst="OA17631012n90-2" type="given" value="THOMAS"/>Thomas New</persName> came in and struck the prisoner more than once. This witness asked New why he would strike a man in his own house? he answered, if he don't like that he shall have more: but on some farther expostulation and discourse New sat down and drank with them, and talked somewhat to the prisoner's wife. This witness did not see the prisoner again till he came up to the deceased as he sat in a chair and stabbed him, and then went out again. The time between the deceased striking the prisoner and the stabbing was five or six minutes. The deceased got out, alarmed the neighbours that he was stabbed by Cinderbury, who, after</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176310120015"/>
            <p>some resistance was taken, and the knife found bloody. The deceased was carried up to his mother's room bleeding, reported that he only went for a halfpenny-worth of milk, and said to the deceased, why are you always quarrelling with your wife? This was confirmed as to the material part by several witnesses. It happened between eight and nine at night. The surgeon proved the wound was mortal, given by a violent stroke which made an impression on two of his ribs, passed through part of the lungs and the pericardium. The wonder was, that the wounded man did not drop down dead, which the surgeon endeavoured to account for.</p>
            <p>The prisoner in his defence, asserted he never saw the deceased before, till he followed his wife into his house, and struck him twice or thrice very hard. He asked him, why he did so? and in struggling to get him out, the deceased was wounded, but whether by him or the deceased himself he cannot tell. He also insisted on his right of defending himself in his own house. The question was: Whether this fact could be deemed any thing less than murder, or be brought in manslaughter? But the time between the provocation and the fact, added to the mortal weapon, turned the scale, and the jury brought in their verdict guilty.</p>
            <p>Quickly after, when asked by the court, what can you say why sentence should not be pronounced upon you according to law? He answered vehemently, It was neither law nor justice. And to the concluding words of the sentence, may God almighty have mercy on your soul! He replied with great emotion, " I hope he will, and that I shall " come better off than those fellows," pointing to the witnesses; and speaking and looking with great resentment against them.</p>
            <p>This behaviour shewed a very unpromising prospect of bringing this convict to a degree of repentance proportioned to his crime: however, when visited, he was more calm and complying, hearkened to good advice, and joined in fervent prayer for pardon of this and all his sins. He was assisted also with books; and a prisoner kindly read to him in his cell. He would still tell the story of the provocation to this fact, in a manner different from the evidence, saying, his wife went to look for a lodging for his friend <persName id="OA17631012n94-1">

His wife confirmed this part of his story, adding, that the deceased threatened to call the watch. These, with some late broils in his family, had inflamed the man's spirit and imbittered his temper; for he had been imprisoned for a week in <placeName id="OA17631012-geo-99">

He had also been absent from her of late for a year together in the country, on account of their living ill together, and their frequent quarrels; so that his friends often dissuaded him from ever seeing her again: and yet, each spoke well of the other separately, as to their natural temper, and when like themselves; but each charged the other with being adicted to liquor, and of a hasty temper.</p>

He has left three daughters, the youngest about 11 years of age; and earnestly prayed, that the survivors may take warning by him, and avoid that sin and shame, to which excess of drinking, in one of the family has exposed them.</p>
            <p>Oo the Morning of Execution,</p>
            <p>October 22, being questioned, he was found penitent, humble, and resigned, said he had called to mind all his past sins, and prayed for pardon and mercy to the best of his capacity all night, in the dark; for he had no candle from six in the evening till this morning half hour past six.</p>
            <p>When he went up to chapel, he declared, as a dying man, that this fact was sudden and without previous malice; for that he had never seen the deceased before the night it was done, when he came in and struck him in his own house, at a time he was quiet and not quarrelling with his wife, for that was over.</p>
            <p>He joined in proper prayers, the litany, and the holy communion. In all which some pious and charitable neighbours did also assist and join with us. He seemed greatly comforted and well composed.</p>
            <p>Having thus tasted the benefit of these sacred and divine ordinances; he acknowledged with grief, that the neglect of them, and especially of prayer, public and private, was his ruin. Being asked if he remembred the articles of the belief?</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176310120016"/>
            <p>he tried, and repeated them, with a remarkable deliberation, and seriousness.</p>
            <p>After the reception of the holy communion, he was exhorted to fix his heart and look unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, &amp;c. and as it was difficult for him to read in the way, being at best but a bad reader, to meditate on that precious faith, and the petitions of the Lord's Prayer.</p>
            <p>He was carried out of the goal about nine. His wife went up into the cart trembling and fainting to take her last leave of him. He arrived at the place soon after ten; and having offered up some proper prayers, in which the people joined at his request, he spoke a few words by way of warning to all, to " take heed and beware of drunkenness and excess, " for that was the inlet to most of the crimes " he had been guilty of." He expressed his sorrow for all his sins, and specially that for which he suffered, desired their prayers for his pardon to the last.</p>
            <p>Being asked whether he was sorry for his misbehaviour and rash words in the court after conviction? After some pause he answered, he was sorry for it, and prayed for pardon: whether he found hope and comfort within him? he answered, that he did.</p>
            <p>After a final blessing he added, " I pray God bless you and all mankind!" which he again repeated while I parted from him. After which he quickly suffered with great calmness about half an hour past ten. The people around continuing to pray for him.</p>
