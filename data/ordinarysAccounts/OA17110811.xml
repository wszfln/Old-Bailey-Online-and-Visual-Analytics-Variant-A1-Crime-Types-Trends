Since that time I read it to him again more than once; and thereupon he again declar'd, That the Facts were all true, and he was concerned in every one of them: But he said withal, That he had none of the 32 Guineas taken from Governour Beal. So that it seems W. M. kept them all for himself.</p>
            <p>This Sutton, I found, was under a very great disappointment, as having (even to the last) been in expectation of a farther Reprieve; hoping (but in vain) that his Money (which he said was no less than 100 Guineas, which he had ready to give to save his Life) might do great Feats that way; but he was much mistaken therein. I wish other Offenders would take Warning by this; and in good earnest prepare for Death, which is certain; seriously considering, that such a Preparation will do them no harm, but a great deal of good, whether they live, or dye.</p>
            <p>Before this Malefactor was carry'd (as he was this Day from <placeName id="OA17110811-geo-22">

All he now could do, was to pray for them; as he did for his own Soul, imploring God's Mercy and Forgiveness, and that all his wicked Deeds and Iniquities might be wash'd and done away in the Blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>At the Place of Execution, I attended him for the last time; I exhorted him more and more to repent, and to stir up his Heart to God. I pray'd by him, sung some Penitential Psalms with him, and made him rehearse the Apostles Creed. Then recommending his Soul to God, I withdrew. And he having spoken to the People to this Effect, viz. That they would take care not to break the Sabbath-day, nor keep lewd Company, as he had done, and, That they would pray for his departing Soul. At this there was a great Shout made by the Standers-by.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he betook himself to his private Devotions, for which he had some time allow'd him: And that being over, the Cart drew away, and he was turn'd off, while he thus call'd upon GOD. Lord be merciful unto me! Lord have mercy upon me! Lord JESUS have mercy upon me! &amp;c.</p>

            <p>I Have brought all my Misfortunes on my self: And tho' I had the tenderest of Fathers, yet my own Extravagant Humour led me into Uncleanness, Drunkenness, and the Unlawful Means to support both, which has brought me to this Unfortunate End. I must own, I make this particular Observation; That when I first left GOD, and did not observe his Day, He left me to be led away to my utter Ruin here, and I must only rely on the immense Mercy of my Creator, thro' the Merits of my blessed Redeemer: And I beg Forgiveness of all the World, but more especially my Father and Family. I beg the World may not reflect on my Wife and Children; she has been a tender Wife and Mother. This is the first time I ever was charg'd with injuring the least Soul; and the Lord have Mercy on me, and comfort my Wife, and help my Children.</p>
