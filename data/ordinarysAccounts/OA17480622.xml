He seemed to express a good deal of Uneasiness, as he had something particular to say to her. An oldGentlewoman who was there, and the Maid, seeing him so uneasy, pressed him to walk in, telling him, it would not be long before the Lady would come home; accordingly he went with them down into the Kitchen, and sat for some time talking with them on indifferent Matters, till at length he 'spied a Silver Cup upon the Table, at which, he says, his Fingers itch'd, and he could not be easy till he was Master of it; and as he never wanted an Excuse on these Occasions, he desired the Maid to draw him some small Beer; but the Girl had like to have spoiled his Scheme, for she was going to lay hold of the Cup to draw it in; but he had his Wits about him, and prevented her, telling her he was very thirsty, and that the Cup would not hold enough to quench it; on which she took a larger Vessel, and while she was gone, he turned his Back on the old Gentlewoman, and she being also a little dim-sighted, he conveyed the Cup into his Pocket unseen. The Maid returning with the small Beer, he drank it, and then seemed to be in a Hurry, said, he could not well stay any longer now, but would call again another time, and went off undiscovered.</p>

He says he prays to God, and heartily wishes that his Punishment may be an Exemplary Warning to debarr all others from injuring those to whom, under God, they owe their Subsistence, and every thing they enjoy.</p>

            <p>He has all along declared, he had no Accomplice in this Robbery; he never was prompted to it by any one, nor did any one Person know when he committed the Fact, upon his Word, as he was a dying Man, and hoped to appear in the Presence of that God who searcheth the Secrets of all Hearts. He says, he never once thought of doing this Wickedness, till the very Day he put it in Practice: 'Twas a sudden Temptation he fell under, and the false Prospect of Advantage so blinded his Eyes, that he could not look unto the End and Consequence of this evil Action; but he run into the Pit that was made for him, without seeing the Danger. He knew his Master wanted not Money, and he resolved to run the Risk of finding it; and his Heart was so captivated with the Success proposed, that he never thought of a Discovery, nor gave himself Liberty to think whether he was going to do Good, or to do Evil. And, he believes verily, had he considered it in this Light, he never should have committed the Robbery. But as one who builds Castles in the Air, promises himself to do great Things, if he succeed so and so, and his Hopes at last evaporate; so he had proposed to himself this Scheme, which not only proved ineffectual to his Wishes, but cost him his Life, the dearest Price Man can pay for any of the World's Goods. He proposed to himself, when he had gotten the Money, to set up a Publick-house, or Ale-house, and to trade with it, till he was in such a Way of Business as to be able to spare it again; and then, he says, his Way of Thinking was to have return'd it again. To expose the Absurdity of this, I need not be at the Pains, every one must see and discover the Ignorance and Folly of a Man who could offer to build upon so sandy a Foundation. But this, he says was his Purpose, and accordingly the Success he promised to himself led him on to put this Scheme in Practise; and he went to his Master's House, broke open the Bureau, and took out of it the Moneis and Watch, as they were found upon him, and as laid in the Indictment against him.</p>

            <p>The Heinousness of this Man's Crime was so much the more aggravated by the particular Obligations he lay under to a kind indulgent Master. In robbing him, he not only acted against the Law of God and his Country, but against Common Law and Gratitude, to eat his Master's Bread, to receive from him Food and Rayment, and in Return to behave with Villany and Perfidy, is the blackest Ingratitude. Whereas Faithfulness is every where in Scripture commanded, where the relative Duties of Master and Servant are consider'd, and positive Injunction laid on Servants not to purloin. He shou'd be careful for his Master's Good, and as thrifty and diligent in doing the Work of his Family, as if it were the Work of his own. Therefore when a Man giveth another Wages, convenient Food, and all other Things needful to the Support of Life, in Hopes to be helped by his Faithfulness and Diligence; then for him, who is thus supported, to deceive, where he is trusted, or any way to reward Good with Evil, is such odious Theft, as is against the Law of Nature, and all Nations, and is sure to meet with proper and deserved Punishment, whenever it is detected.</p>
            <p>The Crime, he cou'd not but acknowledge, with all its aggravating Circumstances, and tho' he had Reason sufficient to be sorry and repent of all his Offences, of this particularly for which he suffered, and that he deserved to die for it. But hoping that God might be gracious unto him in the future Life, he put his Trust in his Mercy, and thro' the Merits of Jesus waited the Pardon of all Sins.</p>

But as all Hope disappear'd, he desired his Soul might be recommended to God, and he was content to trust himself to the Mercy of God, through Jesus Christ.</p>
