As he afterwards found, by woful experience, that the neglect of the good instructions given him by his parents, had brought him into great trouble in this world, and likewise to a shameful and ignominious death. He had a very liberal education: As he grew up he seemed inclined to go to sea, and therefore was taught every thing necessary to fit him for an able <rs id="OA17650213-occupation-9" type="occupation">seaman</rs>

He was sometime mate of a merchant-ship, and had a very good character. He married a wife, by whom he had several children. After some time his brother and he bought two ships between them, one of which he commanded, and went through many hardships. He was near 25 years of age. He was of a very lively disposition, which made many that saw him, while under sentence of death, conclude, by his behaviour, that he had no thoughts of a future state; but when I spoke to him in private, and laboured to impress upon his conscience, the certainty of a judgment to come, and the punishment that would be inflicted upon those that died impenitent, he wept bitterly, and said, Though he was of a chearful disposition, yet when he was alone he seriously reflected upon that unalterable state he was so soon to enter upon, and that this made him earnestly cry to God to have mercy upon his immortal soul. He said he had no earthly concern but the disgrace he had brought upon his family, and the distress his dear wife, and children, and mother, were in on his account. He declared the first cause of his ruin was, a disregard of the good instructions</p>

            <p>given him, and particularly the neglect of prayer, both public and private. "O sir! said he, if men did but fear God and worship him, they would be happy in this world and in that which is to come: by neglecting of this I have been led from one sin to another, till at last I married a second wife, though I had a modest one at that time living. My second wife, together with her mother, was the cause of my ruin; for not having money to supply their extravagancies, they first put me upon forging. I forged several bills of exchange upon merchants that I knew, and at last that for which I am to suffer." He owned himself to be guilty of forging the bill that he was tried for the sessions before last.</p>
            <p>The Sunday before he suffered he received the holy sacrament, and behaved in a very decent manner. He desired all young men to take warning by him, and not keep bad company, but to fear God and walk in the ways of his commandments, if they would escape misery in time and eternity. He constantly flattered himself with the hopes of a reprieve, and said, his interest was so great, that if he was not reprieved he believed no one ever would. May God grant he may be a warning to all others, to deter them from that vile practice for which he suffered, and for which many have suffered within these few years last past!</p>

He got into the yard by the assistance of a ladder, and broke into the window of the servant's hall, and took away Mr. Brown's herald's robe, and the other things mentioned in the indictment; all which he sold to Levi the Jew.</p>
            <p>In November he broke into the house of his grace the duke of Norfolk. He first got upon the leds, and then looked down into a window, where he saw a man's hat lying, and was afraid that there was somebody in the room; but at last he ventured down and got in. He found the silk, mentioned in the indictment, laying in a chair. He said, there was some silk twisted up, which looked like scains of sewing silk. He desired me to insert this particular for the satisfaction of the family, that they might be assured he was the person that was guilty of the robbery. All the things he took he sold to Levi the Jew.</p>
            <p>In the month of December he broke into the house of the Rt. Hon. the earl of Verney, (which was the last robbery he committed, and that for which he suffered) on the 17th of December, about the hour of one or two in the morning. He got in at the window of the house-keeper's room; the window-shutter was shut, but not barred: he said, if it had, he should soon have got it it open; for he never saw a house in his life but he could break it open. He took away all the plate he could get at, which he sold to Levi the Jew for 4s. an ounce. He said, if it had not been for Levi, and such who receive stolen goods, he never should have continued a thief. It were to be wished that such would consider the heinousness of their crime, and turn to God; for though they may, by turning king's evidence, escape the sword of justice in this world, yet they cannot escape the just judgment of God at the great day.</p>

After which they were brought down into the Press-yard and had their irons knocked off. About nine o'clock they were put into two carts to be conveyed to the place of execution. In the way Captain James wept bitterly, and earnestly prayed for mercy, and that God would comfort his poor disconsolate mother and wife. <persName id="OA17650213n61-2">

            <p>At the place of execution I spent half an hour with them in prayer. <persName id="OA17650213n62-1">

While I was praying with the others he desired to speak to the croud, and addressed them in the following manner: "Look on me, who am going to suffer for my crimes, young "men, and take warning by me, and beware of bad company, especially that of lewd women, for they lead many "to destruction. O remember your Creator in the days of your "youth, before the evil days come! The neglect of my church "and the commandments of my God hath brought me to this.</p>

I have "continued in a long course of thieving, and have often had "great remorse of conscience for it, and a desire to forsake it, but "I still continued in the same way. I was evidence against "one that was executed, and others that are transported, but now "justice hath overtaken me also. Young men, if you find any "inclination to thieving, for God's sake turn from it, lest you "should come to the same untimely end with me. You may "learn from the objects before you, that the wages of sin is "death." At a quarter after eleven they were turned off, calling upon God to receive their souls.</p>
