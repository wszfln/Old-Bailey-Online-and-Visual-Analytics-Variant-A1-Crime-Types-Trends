            <p>When under Sentence, most of them being YOUNG MEN, wholly addicted to their sensual Appetites, and void of all good Qualities, and by Consequence grosly ignorant of religious Matters, and wholly unacquainted with the Ways of God. I expos'd to them the Danger and unreasonableness, of giving themselves up to their own Hearts, Lusts, and vicious Appetites, since that Course of Life cannot fail to bring them to Misery, Contempt, Disgrace and exemplary Punishment in this World, if persisted in, and if not repented of, to eternal Misery and Desolation in the Life to come. I show'd them that God had made us reasonable Creatures, after his own Image in Knowledge, Righteousness and true Holiness, that being endow'd with rational Faculties, capable to discern betwixt good and evil, it was a perverting of our Nature and insulting our Reason, to give ourselves up to the fulfilling of our wicked Hearts, Lusts and vicious Inclinations, which alienate our Minds from God, rob us of that glorious Image and Pattern after which we were made, and make us degenerate into the Nature of Fiends, Lyons, Tygers and other Beasts of Prey: So that instead of being Beneficent, Good and Merciful, like unto God who is all Love and Goodness, who is kind to the Evil and the Good, St. Mathew, v. 45. That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven: For he waketh his Sun to rise on the Evil and on the Good, and sendeth Rain on the Just and on the Unjust. They become common Enemies to God and Man, and every Thing which is Good and Vertuous, desirable and reasonable; and thus they precipitate themselves into innumerable Calamities, Sorrows and Distresses. And therefore the wise Solomon says, Righteousness exalteth a Nation: But Sin is a Reproach to any People. Prov. xiv. 34.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173112200005"/>
            <p>I show'd them the great Evil of Theft and Robbery, from the Cause of it, Covetousness, and too great a Love to this present evil World, an indulging of themselves in their carnal Lusts and Pleasures, which stand in a direct Opposition to every Thing that's Good and Virtuous, and expose us to the Wrath and Vengeance of God, both in this Life and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>From all which I exhorted them to a steadfast Faith in Christ, as the Son of God, equal to the Father, and the only Saviour of Sinners; to a hearty and sincere Repentance for all their Sins, particularly the henious Offences of which they were Convicted; to Love God and set their Affections on Heaven and Happiness; and to forgive their Enemies.</p>
            <p>I instructed them how they were early dedicated to God in Baptism, and that they had notoriously broken their baptismal Vows and Engagements. Wherefore it was necessary to renew their Covenant with God, by partaking in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, instituted in Commemoration of Christ's Death and Sufferings. This I insisted on from these Words of our blessed Saviour, Do this in Remembrance of me, St. Luke xxii. 19. and from Rev. xix. 9. Blessed are they which are called into the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>While these and many such Exhortations were given, they all attended in Chapel, and were apparently attentive to Exhortations and Prayers. Cole was serious and very devout. Payn seem'd to be an indolent slothful Fellow; while he was under his unhappy Misfortunes, he lost or stole a Prayer-book belonging to the Chapel. All they who could read made regular Responses, Woolcot was very Sick two Days, and when he was able, attended in Chapel, and appear'd very Penitent, as he did when I visited him in the Cell.</p>

He told also, that his Grandfather left him 250 l. but that his Father and Mother found a Way to get rid of it, while he was young; the want of which hindered him from doing Business to purpose.

His Parents were careful in bestowing on him a very good Education, and his Genius was so tractable, that at eleven Years old, he was able to translate Extempore, a Chapter out of the Latin Testament into English. But they not having Ability to breed him to any learned Profession, he apply'd himself chiefly to Writing and Arithmetick, in which he profited so well, as to fit himself for any Sort of Business. When he grew up to about Fifteen, his Mother died, and some short Time after he was bound Prentice to his Father. He now begun to grow very Headstrong, and Regardless of his good Father's Admonition, addicting himself to Idleness, and foolish Pastimes, neglecting his Business, and wearying the Patience of an indulgent Parent. Time went on at this sad Rate, till he was turned off Twenty, and then he took it in his Head to marry. The Person he pitched on, was a young Woman, whose Father was a watch Chain Maker. She hapening to be the chief Hand in her Father's Business, he could not well tell what to do without her, and prevailing at last both upon Cole and her, he took them into his House, and allowed them a Room; but in less than a Month, he grew so intolerable, that he left their House, and absented himself from all his Relations, for about two Months, six Weeks of which Time, he lived with a Woman of the Town.

On his Return, he found both his Father, and his Father-in-Law dead.

Next Morning, Jumbo (as he call'd him) went and acquainted a Person who lives in Chick-Lane, that he had committed a Robbery when he was drunk upon such a One, and in Company of such Persons, naming them. This Person to whom he told the Story, goes away directly to the three other Persons whom he mentioned, one living near Chick-Lane, the other two in Drury Lane, and they consulted together to apprehend the Prisoner, and P-e, one of these Persons, lent Pain a Coat to go out in, to see if he could find them. On Wednesday the 24th of November last they met, when Pain told them, he had been before the Person they had Robbed, that he could not sweat to him, and that every thing was quiet as they could wish; and after a Walk towards <placeName id="OA17311220-geo-20">

He seemed to have a great Abhorrence and Detestation of his Crimes, and said, all the Service he could now render his Country, was to mention what fell within his Notice of the Methods proper for suppressing evil House, and preventing Youth from being drawn into such Mischiefs, as too often bring them to a shameful and untimely Death. He minuted, in Writing, several such Places, where he affirmed, they made a Practise of getting young Fellows, and when they have induced to squander what they have the next Thing they do, is to perswade them to go out a Robbing, providing them with Companions, whom they encourage them to impeach, upon which they cause them to be seized; by this Means cheating the Publick of the Rewards, and the deluded Wretches of their Lives. He expressed some Displeasure against those who apprehended them, and said, P-e told him, one of those four Persons had help'd him to his Pistols, and offer'd him a Horse: However, the Prisoner declar'd, he freely and heartily forgave them; that he died in Charity with all the World; own'd he had been a great Sinner, but hoped God had extended his Mercy so far to him, as to give him a sincere and hearty Repentance; said, he rely'd only on the Merits of his Saviour, and earnestly intreated the Prayers of all charitable Christians for his departing Soul.</p>

            <p>My DEAR LIFE,</p>
            <p>THIS comes from your Dying Husband, desiring for Christ's sake to Mind what I am going to write. My dear we have been but a short time together, as God thought it so fit, to take me out of this miserable World, and to make my poor immortal Soul happier in the next. My Dear, take my Advice for God Almighty sake, refrain that Course of Living; altho' you get but Six-pence a day, it will be sweeter then if you have 10 s. the other way. Consider the Sins you commit against your poor immortal Soul, besides the Punishment of your poor Body in this World, making you Old, before you</p>

            <p>are Young. My Dear, go to your Aunt and implore to her for Christ's sake, that she would look upon you, and take you in favour again and show her this Letter; it will be a great Easement to my Mind, if you will but Promise me that you will do your best endeavour. My Dear, consider what a great Work I am going thro', the Day of my Dissolution draweth near, my Soul being upon the brink of Eternity, either to go into those eternal Flames, or else into everlasting Happiness. But I trust still in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who sits at the right Hand of his Father, making Intercession for our poor immortal Souls, as when that great tribunal Day cometh, when the Trumpets shall found the Alarm, the Rocks will rent, the Graves will open, the Sea will give up her Dead, then both Body and Soul will be joyned together again, for to take share of one Punishment: O! what blessed Saying will that be, when our Saviour says, as his Writing in the xxv. Chapter of St. Mathew, and the 34 Verse. Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the Foundation of the World. So my Dear for God Almighty's Sake hear my Prayers, and take my Advice, it will be the better for your poor immortal Soul, when you come to pay the Debt as I am going to pay. So no more, but I desire your Prayers to God Almighty, for my Poor departing Soul; which is all at Present from your poor Dying Husband.</p>

            <p>WE are all sensible that the Day of Dissolution is near, nearer than what we expected, according to the Laws of God and Man, we have receiv'd our fatal Sentence in this World, that is for to take our Lives; but we hope to receive a happier Sentence for our Souls, at the last and great tribunal Day, when the Trumpets shall sound, the Rocks shall rent, the Graves shall be open'd, the Sea shall give up her Dead, and our blessed Lord and Saviour Christ, who sets at the Right Hand of God the Father, making Intercession for our poor immortal Souls. And how God Almighty had sent to us his Son, to suffer for the Sins of us Sinners, who suffered Death upon the Cross, who was buffetted and spitted at, whose Hands and Feet was nail'd to the Cross, whose Side was pierced, who drank Vinegar and Gall, who wore a Crown of Thorns on his Head: Thus did our great God, suffer his only begotten Son to lay down his Life for our poor immortal Souls: Consider my fellow Sufferers our Moments is short, let us consider the Suffering of our blessed Saviour, as he went through for us poor miserable Sinners, to save us from those eternal Flames; Let us with true Repentance and a sincere Heart, follow those good Examples, as our blessed Saviour doth Express. Come unto me</p>

            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>YOU are come to give us Warning that we must suffer according to our fatal Sentence, that is to be hang'd by the Neck till we are Dead, for what we have been guilty on against the Laws of God, and Man. To-Morrow is that fatal Day that we are to suffer: Therefore I Desire the Prayers of all good Christian People that is here Present, likewise of them that doth not hear me; it is a sad Thing, for a Man to know the Time that he must depart this miserable World, let him be never such a good Liver, certainly be must have a great Terrour upon his Conscience, knowing that his Soul doth lye upon the Brink of Eternity. How can we expect Mercy from him, whom we have so highly offended; but still our blessed Saviour says, there shall be more rejoycing over one Sinner that repenteth, then ninety and nine just Persons that needeth no Repentance: So I trust through the Mercy of our blessed Saviour Christ, that with a true Repentance, and a sincere Heart, I shall be receiv'd into his heavenly Kingdom. So the Lord have Mercy upon my Soul, Christ have Mercy upon my Soul, the Lord have Mercy upon my Soul.</p>

Daultworth jump'd down two Stories high, and was bruised by the Fall, yet in two or three Days he was well again, and said, if his Leg had not been hurt, that he could not walk, he had got off; for they had got in Tools to saw off their Irons, and their Legs were at Liberty.</p>
            <p>He declared himself very penitent, and said, that he gave good Christian Advices to the rest, who had attempted, though without Success, their Escape with him, particularly to a young Man who was acquitted upon a capital Indictment. He owned the Justice of his Sentence, according to Law, saying, that he was very willing to die, only it grieved much for to leave his Family unprovided, his Wife having given away every thing to support him under Sentence, and being in a very miserable Condition. He declared his Faith in Christ, a hearty Repentance for all his Sins, and that he died in Peace with all Mankind, and in the Roman Communion.</p>

About a Year ago he bega to haunt a Brandy-shop in that Neighbourhood too frequently, and there he became intimately acquainted with several of the most notorious Thieves, Robbers, and common Whores about the Town, who by their wicked Company and Conversation, entirely corrupted his Morrals, and left no vestage of Virtue remaining. With his wicked Companions he went out, left his Masters House, sometimes for eight Days at once, and liv'd upon picking of Pockers, stealing and thieving whatever he could lay hold on; and at Night he enjoy'd the sweet Company of his fellow Thieves and Pick-Pockets, and those common Prostitutes, who never fail to attend such rascally disposed People, one of whom (as he said) he Married, who afterwards pass'd for his Wife. I saw three or four of these vile Creatures coming to him, while under Sentence, one of whom at a Time I reprov'd, and told her, that they ought to be asham'd to appear before honest People, who had thus ruin'd and brought to the Gallows a poor silly Boy, little more than a Child, and who was of a much better Family then they were: Afterwards I did not see any of them appear.

After this Exploit he was soon taken up, and so prevented him from doing any farther mischief, by prosecuting his villanous Intentions. While he was a child, as he said he was observant of felial duties and kept the School and went to church frequently, and liv'd soberly, till he subjected himself to the influence and conduct of these base Instruments of Hell and Satan.

A year or two ago he married a wife of his Kidney, with whom he lived in the same house, with his Father and Mother. He mind, ed his employment very little, but went out upon purchase of what he could get, by thieving and stealing out of houses or otherwise. He confess'd the Burglary for which he died. He own'd that he had been guilty of many thefts and larcenies, and that he was plung'd in those abominable Vices, which are common to thieves and robbers. He was pretty well drest, with silver mounting upon his cloaths, but was but indifferently taken care of, by reason of his Mother and Wife being confin'd in the said Gaol. He always behav'd modestly and gravely in chapel, where he constantly attended.

            <p>THE Fact that I die for, I actually committed, therefore I ask Pardon of God and Man for what ever I have Offended against them in this Miserable World. I freely forgive all Mankind as I hope my Saviour Christ will Forgive me: and I Dye in Charity with all the World: I must own, that I have been a wicked Liver, but through the Merits of my blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that Suffered upon the Cross, I hope to be saved; Therefore I desire the prayers of all good Christian People for the Benefit of my poor Soul, which now lyes at the Brink of Eternity, when the Breath Departs the Body, the Soul and the Body is seperated; the Body returns to the Earth from whence it came, the Soul it takes its flight, either to the eternal Flames, or else to everlasting Happiness, there to be confin'd till that great Tribunal Day that is when the Body and Soul shall joyn to take share of one Punishment together, either of Everlasting Happiness, or else the enternal Flames. Now when that great and Dreadful Day of Judgment cometh; when our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, shall set at the Right Hand of his Father, making Intercession for our poor Immortals Souls, O what a blessed saying will that be, Come ye Blessed of my Father Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World. O what blessed saying will that be to them that Dies in the fear of the Lord. So the Lord Almighty bless you and keep you, and lift up the Light of his Countenance upon you, both now and for ever more. Amen, I pray God. So the Lord have Mercy upon my Soul, Christ have Mercy upon my Soul, so the lord have Mercy upon my soul.</p>
            <p>He caus'd this Paper to be handed to me in the Coach. Then he began and sung a Hymn to the Tune of an Anthem, which he looking upon the Coach and Company where I was, continued Singing, till he was carried off and choak'd. All of them desired the Prayers of all good and faithful Christians, and (as they were desired) went off the Stage, crying to God to have Mercy upon their poor souls, and that the lord Jesus would receive their Spirit. Knowland and his son kissed each other, after their Faces were covered, and then they embraced, and took their last Farewel. The Father's Body was chosen, since he had brought the son to that fatal end and carried off accordingly.</p>
