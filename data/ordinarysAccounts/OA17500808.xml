He lived among his Relations till they were all tired of his Ways of going on, but took Care to keep from them the Knowledge of what Company he kept; and though they complained of his staying out of Nights, and other little Irregularities that came to their Ears, yet they never suspected his being so notorious, or that he was a Companion of such People, as at last it appears he was, and has been perhaps longer than he chuses to own.</p>
            <p>After he had tired them with disturbing their Family, coming Home at all Hours in the Night; and perhaps they suspected some further Inconveniencies, if not Dangers, might ensue, they were so fond and indulgent as to hire a Lodging for him Abroad, where he was for some short Time tolerably free from Mischief, left their Watchfulness of his Ways might discover his Tricks. This lasted not long, but he procured Leave to take a Lodging for himself at their Expence, and when he wanted the Money, if not supplied by his own Craft, he used to apply to them for it.</p>

For he was become now so fond of his Company, mostly belonging to those Parts, that he could not bear to be absent Day or Night, because there he found Mistresses at his Pleasure, and Companions to go upon the Haunt whenever he pleased. But how should he keep this from his Friends? Being obliged to go to them often for Money, Enquiry was made where his Lodgings were, but to no Purpose: He always found some Excuse to bring himself off, that they might not know where it was, and he received some Favours from them while they thought him, as a Relation or Friend, a proper Person to assist, which helped his idle and extravagant Expences with Mistresses, and at Gaming, and when that was gone he must turn out for more. At last his Method of Life was discovered by his Benefactors, and when their Favours were therefore withdrawn, he was obliged to betake himself to Rapineand Plunder as Opportunity presented.</p>
            <p>And now having no farther Dependance upon his Friends and Well wishers, he must rely only on himself and Companions in Wickedness, and says he has been guilty of many Robberies within eight Months past, the Particulars of some of which he has related, but not the Whole, lest Reflections might be made, and thrown in the Dish of his Friends, as he said, who were kind, and used him better than he deserved at their Hands, and were quite ignorant of his wicked Courses during his being with them; and for ought he knows, after he entirely left their Company, and despised their good Admonitions, he was loath to expose the Multitude of his Villanies, but that they were many he would not deny in Capacity of Pickpocket, Street-Robber, and common Gambler.</p>
            <p>He behaved tolerably quiet in the general under his unhappy Circumstances, and could put on the Appearance of a sorrowful Countenance when he thought proper, or assume the affected Assurance, which these poor Wretches too frequently show, according to the Company he had about him. When he was talked to of the Errors of his past Life, nobody could seem more affected and sorrowful than he, but when his Back was turned, no-body could be more audacious. Being asked, whether in all his Pranks he had no Notion of being brought to Account, he said, while he was at Work no Thoughts molested him with regard to what was to come, but he always looked forward to the Hope of what he could get: He knew other in as much Danger as himself, and they went on longer undiscovered, and thought to do so still himself, as he said was the Case with most that he knew concerned in those wicked Ways.</p>

And though he escaped the Gallows but at last May Sessions, for want of sufficient Evidence only, (because the Guilt he owned to me) yet he could not take Warning; and was so ingenuous as to own, that he should have continued still this Way of Life, had he not been thus cut off, or by some Means put out of the Way. He entertained great Hopes before the Warrant came down, knowing he had Friends in the World; and though he had been a very bad Fellow, and concerned in various Robberies, and other Wickednesses, expected to get off at last for Transportation. He was a Man of a very hardened and undaunted Spirit, and continued so to the last. A particular Account of some of the Robberies in which he was concerned, will follow in the Sequel.</p>

He always bore the Character of a Gambler, &amp;c. when on Shore; and when the Notoriety of his Villainies had made the Land too hot to hold him, he used to betake himself to Sea. It is generally said by those who knew him, and who came in Numbers to see him while under Sentence of Death, (being as well known as any one that has gone up Holborn-Hill for a long Time past) that scarce a Day of his Life passed when ashore, but he did somewhat deserving Transportation or Death; once, we are sure, he was transported, but staid not Abroad half his Time, and every one must allow he was now deserving the Fate he met with.</p>
            <p>Though he was fond of committing daily bad Actions in his Life-time, yet he was unwilling it should be published to the World after his Death; which I charitably suppose proceeded from the Man's having a Sense he ought not to have been guilty of these Things, or else, why should he think rather to keep the Knowledge of them from the World? And when a Man has a proper Sense of Sin, we have some Room to hope he will think it necessary to repent; and I am really sorry to say it, No-body that saw him since Conviction, that I ever heard of, could observe or mark any Signs of true Repentance in him, from his outward Behaviour, or from what he said to declare, his inward Sentiments. For he was sorry, he said: But for what? Not that he had been so notorious an Offender against the Laws of God and his Country, but that he was to be hanged. And when I pressed the Duty of Charity, and Good-will towards Men, he replied. How could he be in Charity with all Men, when a Man had falsely sworn away his Life! Strange! Wondrous strange! That a Man so near the End of his Days, just about to leap into Eternity, could be so wicked as to think, much more to say, a Thing so contrary to the Truth, and that Testimony which his own Conscience must bear to him.</p>
            <p>He was bred a Dissenter, and the Day before his Execution, some one, if not two of that Way of thinking, came in the Morning to have some Discourse with him. I wished them better Success with him than all I had and could say had met with; but what was the Result of their Conference I know not. They told me indeed, that Crawford and his Friends were afraid his former Transactions would be exposed to the World; which was what neither he nor his Friends did choose should be done. And we charitably hope, that this their Way of thinking proceeded from the same Motive as his own Reluctance at this Matter, viz. a Sense of what he had been doing being unjustifiable, not that it was improper the World should know it, whereby others might be prevented from taking Warning by the Example made in him, as the Justice of the Law required.</p>

The poor Girl was used very ill by her Husband, and was obliged to get away from him, which she did after a little while. Then Crawford and she took it into their Heads to live together, and did so for some Months; till the fatal Night came, when having made her Drunk, obliged her by Threats to go out with him upon the Scout. They did so, and meeting the Prosecutor, Crawford first quarrelled with him for taking Notice of her, whom he called his Wife, they drank together all three, and before the Liquor was out the Prosecutor went out of the House, and they followed after; she stopt him, saying he should go no farther, while Crawford came behind, and in a cowardly Manner gave him five Blows, which brought him to the Ground on his right Knee, and stuned him for a while. During the Time she took the Watch out of his Pocket, and Crawford, like a Coward still behind him, took away his Wig. The Prosecutor swore very positively to Crawford, and having had a full View of his Face, while they were drinking together, and said, he could not be mistaken in the Man. Upon his Trial, he was so wicked as to bring several Persons to Attempt to prove an Alibi, but the Evidence was so strong against him, and his Defence by their Means in all they could do so weak, that the Jury very justly thought fit to bring him in guilty of the Robbery, and there is no Room left to complain that he suffered for it. The Morning before he was executed he thought proper to own the Fact, and the Justice of his Sentence.</p>
