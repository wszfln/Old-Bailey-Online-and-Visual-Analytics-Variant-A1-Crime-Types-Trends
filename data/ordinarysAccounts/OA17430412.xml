            <p>WHILE under Sentence, most of them being very ignorant, they were instructed in the necessary Articles of our Holy Religion, as our Blessed Saviour directs us, John xvii. 3. And this is Life eternal to know thee, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent. Whence it was needful to observe to them, that the saving Knowledge of God, and Jesus Christ, secures to us eternal Life; and therefore it is necessary that we endeavour to attain this saving Knowledge.</p>
            <p>THEY were likewise admonished sincerely to repent of all their Sins, especially those heinous and villainous Crimes, for which they then suffered so much Shame and Sorrow. To repent of Sin, so as to forsake it; to forsake it, so as to be in Love with the Dictates of Piety, Holiness, and Virtue; to love God, his Precepts and his Ordinances above all Things, and to run in the Way of his Commandments, so as not to grow Weary; to labour so as not to faint, for says our Blessed Saviour, Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish, Luke xiii. 3. And St. Peter to those very Jews who were the Betrayers and Crucifiers of the Lord of Life and Glory, " Repent ye therefore, i. e. of that horrid Guilt " of murthering Christ, with which he had " upbraided them, and be converted, that " your Sins may be blotted out, when the " Times of refreshing shall come from the " Presence of the Lord." From this I observed, that the greatest of Sinners are invited to come unto Christ; " Come unto me all " ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I " will give you rest, St. Matthew xi. 23. " &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THEY were also instructed as to the Nature of the Christian Sacraments, to renew their Baptismal Vows, by receiving the blessed Communion of our Lord's last Supper, wherein we have the Intent and Efficacy of Christ's Death and Sufferings represented, exhibited, and conveyed to us in a visible and lively Manner. Accordingly most of them took the Sacrament, and behaved very devoutly thereat, twice before the Report was made, having been several Weeks under Sentence.</p>
            <p>WHILE these, and many like Admonitions were given, they all attended in Chappel, and seemed very earnest at Prayers and Exhortations, being more affected and serious than many of those unfortunate Creatures often are. Some of them were sick at Times, but so soon as they could conveniently, came up to Chappel, and joined in our religious Exercises. However <persName id="OA17430412n20a-99">

            <p>and might have provided very handsomely for his Family; but inclining to Vice and Idleness, did not mind his Business, and associated with the vilest Company both of Men and Women, which completely ruin'd him; he had some Children, who were so happy as to die before him. He own'd the committing the Burglary he died for, confessing, that he took out two Panes of Glass, and got in at a Window, intending to strip the Kitchen of the Pewter, and every thing else he could have laid Hands on; but Mrs. Hodges coming home just at the Time, he only mov'd four Plates, laying them on the Dresser, for then being interrupted, he was obliged to hurry off without his Prize, and happy had it been for him could he have got off so; but the good Woman seeing him jump out at the Window he came in by, and he happening to fall, she immediately seized and brought him to Justice, otherwise he intended to have plundered the House of every Thing valuable. He declared farther, that he should never have left off that pernicious and destructive Course of Life; but that he had never been guilty of any Burglary, except that for which he had been apprehended, having dealt only in little Rogueries, such as robbing Shops, whilst the Backs of People were turned, and cutting Cloth off the Tenters, with other such like indiscreet Practices which brought him to this deserved, untimely, and ignominious End. In Effect, what better could be expected, having always led a most profligate Life, keeping always the vilest of Company, both Men and Women, especially the latter, for whom he forsook his lawful Wife; and being seldom or never Sober for any long Time, in spite of all wholesome Instructions, Reproofs, and Admonitions of his honest Father, and Spouse, who were continually prophecying, and forewarning him, but too truly, what would be the End of such vicious and destructive Courses.</p>
            <p>ONE Thing above all, stuck for sometime terribly in his Stomach, namely, that he should suffer Death for only breaking into a House, when he did not carry any Thing off; but he never considered that was not owing to any Goodness in himself, but only to his being interrupted and prevented; his Design having been, not to have spared any Thing. At last, however, he seemed better reconciled to it, owned the Justice of his Sentence, and declared he heartily repented, and forgave every one, dying in Peace with all Men, and hoping for Salvation through the Merits and Sufferings of Jesus Christ, in which we hope he was sincere, and are inclined, as we are bound in Charity, to believe he was so, since he did not seem desirous of living longer.</p>

So over-heated were they with Liquor, so little capable of Reflection, and so blind to all the Consequences of this rash Enterprize, that they never considered how much such a Treatment was likely to exasperate him; as also that, as he not only was intimately acquainted with them both, but knew always where to find them, it was putting their Lives directly into his Power.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, no sooner was Taylor called up, which was about Three in the Morning, but they got up likewise, and followed him immediately after he was gone out of the House; he had not got far, before Cavenagh overtook him, presented a Pistol to his Breast, and bid him stand and deliver; and as he had no more Money left than Three-pence, he stript him of all his Cloaths, Breeches and all, which was something unkind in an old Acquaintance and Companion, it being then the fourth of October.</p>
            <p>WHILST this was a-doing, Dilly had the Courage, with a drawn Hanger in her Hand, to stand over him, Lot threatening, if he spoke a Word, to blow his Brains out: Thus they left Taylor naked, and he in revenge, in a few Days, had them taken up, and brought to Justice.</p>

            <p>A Romish Emissary would have had him turn Papist, insisting pretty much upon it; but he would not, nor would Cordelia allow him, though it is to be imagined, neither hers nor his Religion was much; but he told me, his Father was a Tradesman in Dublin, of the Church of England, and took him and his three Brothers constantly to Church with himself, but allowed the Mother, who was a rigid Papist, to take the Girls to Mass with her. He was very willing to confess the Particulars of his Life, (as in the Appendix) and for the most Part behaved indifferently well; but when I spoke to him in private in the Closet, after a little Communication, not being willing to hear good Advice, he ran away. He was unacquainted with, and did not approve the Romish way of Religion, but lov'd the Church of England best. He was a prophane, impudent, ungovernable Fellow. On Monday the 28th of February, 1742-3, he and Cordelia got fuddled, and were very obstreperous, crying out against, and threatning Mr. Wilcox, one of the Turnkeys; but he took no Notice of them. At last, Lot was so unruly, that they were obliged to staple him down in the Cell for a Day or two. Of this Misbehaviour, both of them heartily repented, at least as they said. <persName id="OA17430412n36a-1">

He seemed to be a silly, insignificant young Fellow, and was very ignorant in Religious Matters; I instructed him as the Time could allow. He behaved very decently and penitently, and it is to be hoped obtained Mercy from God. He believed in Christ as the Son of God, and the only Saviour of Sinners, declared he repented of all his Sins, and died in Peace with all the World.</p>

The Goods indeed were all found by his Direction, they having been committed to the care of that Person whom he called his Wife, and all of them, except a Fork or two, he offered for Sale to a Goldsmith, (which was the occasion of his being apprehended,) being sewed up in some Woman's Cloaths.</p>

Nor was it Reasonable for him to hope to escape Punishment, where it only for his Barbarous usage of the Boy, from whom the Goods were taken, whom he wounded both in the Fore and Hind part of his Head, knocking him down, and leaving him for Dead, insomuch that he was not well recovered, when he appeared to give Evidence against Roberts in Court: Accordingly he was soon Convicted, (the lame Excuse he trumpt up, of finding the</p>

Smith humbly begged Pardon of God for so scandalous a Mistake. He was likewise a <rs id="OA17430412-occupation-57" type="occupation">Silver-Thread-Spinner</rs>

He was long sick, and I visited him frequently, when he declared his sincere Repentance; at other Times he constantly came to Chapel, and would sometimes seem attentive to Prayers and Exhortations, behaving indifferently well.

This Clergyman visiting Smith under Sentence, and telling him of this Passage, Smith advised him not to do any Thing displeasing to them, for if at that Time they had suspected his advising the Countryman to shun them, they were so profoundly wicked, that he would have been in Danger of being ston'd to Death with Brickbats, for they regarded not any Person of what Station soever, without Exception.

When upon a Cheat they are sought for, their Custom is to send one or more of the Gang, to know whether People have been to enquire after them, and if they find they are all safe, then they return with the Barrow, which, in a cant Word, they call a Coach.</p>
            <p>THE Method they take in decoying young People, is this: They go out in Gangs, and when they come near the Place of Rendezvous, they part and divide themselves, and very often walk singly, and looking for their Prey, apply to the first Person (if he looks any Way like for their Purpose) they meet, asking some Question about the Murder of a Man, the hanging of another, the committing of a Robbery, till they can lead the poor Creature to the Slaughter.</p>
            <p>WHEN they meet with a Person they think will do, they ask him much such Questions, Whether he has not heard of a Man being shot by a Highwayman, in such a Road? The other saying, No, the Gambler makes Answer, but I'm going to see him, and if you'll walk this Way, you shall be satisfied. This Way is always the way to the Barrow, where being come, the Gentleman Gambler asks the Barrow-Man, whether that is not the ready way to see the dead Body? Who being in the Secret makes Answer, The Body, Sir, is no longer there, it has been carried away this half Hour, or what Time he pleases to mention. To play the Game, there stands near the Barrow-Man, a Fellow whose Hat is full of Oranges, pretending that he has won them all for a Penny; upon which the Gambler gives a Challenge to the Barrow-Man, to engage the young Stranger to go his Halfs, whom he is sure to make win, in order to egg him on, and then he is not left till they strip him, not only of his Money, but of Watch, Rings, and Shoe Buckles, if Silver, and of every Thing valuable.</p>
            <p>THE Cheat consists in the Dice, for if they are to stake at the Dice bringing up the Number 21, at 3 different Throws, they are sure to bring up no more than 17; so if you are to fling for 17, they are sure the Dice will</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174304121016"/>
            <p>reckon up 27; whatever they Bet, they have Dice for the Purpose, which they manage in this Manner: The Barrow-Man, under Pretence of being displeased, snatches up the Dice, and bids the young Fellow to go about his Business, that he will not let them play any longer; upon which the Gambler seems to humour the Barrow-Man, offering him Money, who seems to comply, flings down that Pair of Dice which is to go according to their Number, and the Dice being so effectual to their roguish Design, is because they load them. In short, Smith said, that they were a Set of very infamous Men, that they are more to be dreaded than Highwaymen, for they not only pick Men's Pockets, but very frequently reduce them to the greatest Poverty, to the Shame and Despair of those that are ruin'd, and the Grief and Sorrow of their Relations. Smith said he knew many Gentlemen's Servants utterly ruin'd by their Barrows, and that have, to support themselves, had Recourse to unlawful Means in the Family they liv'd with. In short, he said it was a Pity the Punishment was not adequate to the Crime, for tho' it goes under the Notion of Gaming, yet it is a Contrivance of the greatest Roguery, and of a most dangerous Consequence.</p>

            <p>proper Remedies, promising five Guineas for a compleat Cure, and desiring the Medecines might be got ready against the next Evening, when he would call for them without fail, having Company then waiting for him. In Effect, he came again next Evening, about the same Time, and after some little Preamble, presenting a Pistol charg'd and couch'd, to Mr. Belcher's Breast, and told him very plainly, I want not to be cured, but your Money; Mr. Belcher was very much surpriz'd, and frighten'd, upon holding a cock'd Pistol to his Breast; however, he told him, as he had the Appearance of a Gentleman, he expected no such Treatment; but if he was in want, he would assist him with two Guineas, which Wright took; but then he demanded more, untill the Gentleman made it six, and not contented with that, demanded his Gold Watch.</p>
            <p>MR. Belcher thought the Thief had too much already, yet, for fear of being shot by the desperate Robber, he deliver'd the Gold Watch also; but then, whilst Wright was endeavouring to pocket up the Gold Watch and six Guineas, Mr. Belcher observing the Robber not to be upon his Guard, rush'd in upon, and seized him, and got him down upon the Floor, holding him so fast, that he could not move his Arms; then he cried out to the Servants, and at the same time a Footman came in, and took not only that Pistol from him, but another charged Pistol out of his Pocket; as for the Gold Watch and Six Guineas, they were taken off the Floor, the Robber overcome, having dropt out of his Hands; this done, they secur'd and ask'd him, how he had the Impudence to commit such a villainous, barefac'd Robbery; he said it was nothing but absolute Necessity, and the greatest Want imaginable, being reduced to such Straits, that he cared not whether he lived or died. Accordingly he was committed to <placeName id="OA17430412-geo-79">

He boasted of his great Relations, both in England and Ireland; but his Behaviour, especially in this Affair, was neither like a Gentleman, nor a Man of common Sense and Reason. However attrocious his Crime was, he flatter'd himself with the Hopes of a Reprieve; but when he found himself disappointed, he seemed Indifferent, and very little concern'd about any thing, and 'tis to be fear'd, he died in the Gall of Bitterness and Bond of Iniquity: for after the Dead-Warrant came down to <placeName id="OA17430412-geo-80">

In Chapel, he sometimes asked Questions, and was desirous of Disputing about Principals in Differance; the Authority of the Scriptures, the Translation of the Scriptures about Idolatry in the Church of Rome, which he denied. I told him, if they were not guilty of Idolatry in falling down to, and worshiping carved and painted Images, neither were the Heathens in Time of primitive Christianity, when their Philosophers made the same Apology the Papists do now in that Respect; and agreeable to the old Heathenish Priests and Philosophers, they worshipped Angels, and Great Men and Women, whom they make Demy-Gods, and to whom they erected Temples and Churches, as the Romans made the Pantheon in the City of Rome. I gave Mr. Wright, or Brown, answers sufficient for all his Objections; but he would not give Ear, and I did not think fit to insist too much, especially in a public Place, where a Minister of the Church of England speaks with Authority. He died a rigid Papist; he said he forgave all Men, and was in Peace with them.</p>

            <p>IT is what the World generally expects from Persons in my unhappy Condition, that they should give some Account of themselves, and of their former mispent Lives, were it only to shew Mankind the Snares by which they have been drawn into such Wickedness, in order to their avoiding the same: Partly, therefore, in Compliance with this Custom, and partly because I think it a Duty incumbent upon myself, to make all the Atonement I can, by declaring, not only the Fact for which I am to suffer, but likewise whatever others I have been guilty of from my Youth upwards; both with Design to take Shame to myself for them, and to clear the Innocent, who may Chance to have been suspected, and even to be apprehended and prosecuted, for Crimes whereof I alone am guilty, and which have brought me to this ignominious and untimely End.</p>

When my Parents thought me of a sufficient Age to go to School, they sent me to one Mr. Sheridan, an eminent Master in <placeName id="OA17430412-geo-83">

I served this Master faithfully and justly about four Years, but unfortunately becoming then acquainted with some of the lewd Women with which that Town, as well as this, swarms too much, I never thought myself happy, but when I was in their Company, which I could not be, without neglecting my Master's Business but too frequently, as I accordingly did. This, however, might perhaps have been borne with, at least for some Time longer, had I not robbed my Master to support my Extravagance, and comply with the unreasonable Demands of those unreasonable and riotous Companions, whereof I now too late repent. My Master not only observing my Extravagance, and</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174304121019"/>
            <p>disorderly Course of Life, which gave him but too much Room to suspect me of wronging him; but being likewise wearied out with my frequent lying out of his House, and apprehending something worse might be the Consequence thereof, at last turned me out of Door; upon which my Father was obliged to take me Home, and satisfy my Master for the remaining Part of my Time, that he might make no Noise about my ill Behaviour, to blast my Character.</p>
            <p>I had not been long at my Father's, before I got acquainted with some young Fellows, whom by their Appearance I took to be Gentlemen, but whose real Business (as I found afterwards by woeful Experience) was to decay and inveigle away unwary young Lads, and sell them to Officers in the French Service; by which treasonable, base, and cruel Practices, they gained a plentyful Subsistence. Accordingly one Day, when we were together, they asked me, if I would not do them the Favour to let them have my Company to a Public House, about a Mile out of Town, where they were to have a noble Bowl of Punch, and be very merry. Little apprehending any ill Consequence would ensue from my Compliance, I readily accepted of their Proposal, and consented to go with them, as I accordingly did, but had soon sufficient Reason to remember, a Man can't be too cautious with whom he gets acquainted.</p>
            <p>IN Effect, we were very merry, if Drinking, Singing, and Roaring, can be called real Mirth; in which Kind of jovial Doings we spent the Day, even till Ten at Night; but little did I think it would be my Lot to pay the Piper, as it proved soon afterwards. In the Midst of our Mirth, some young Lads, to the Number of six, dropt in at different Times, with Letters in their Hands, directed to some one of my new Acquaintance; and as each of these came in, he was kindly invited to sit down, and partake of the good Liquor, which he was far from refusing, little imagining, as I suppose, that after sweet Meat, there would come very sowre Sauce. However that be, about Ten at Night my kind and generous new Acquaintance, the pretended young Gentlemen abovementioned, who had given me the Invitation, arose all on a sudden, and drawing each of them a Cutlass he had by his Side, seized on the six poor young Lads and myself, and hurried us all to a Boat, which lay for that Purpose at the Water Side, just by the House where we had been drinking, and carried us directly on Board a Vessel that was lying ready to receive us, where we were clapt into the Hold, amongst above threescore more unfortunate young Wretches, who had been trapann'd on Board in the same Manner. This done, the Vessel hoisted Sail directly for <placeName id="OA17430412-geo-84">

I mention this, to caution all my unthinking young Countrymen, how they accept of an Invitation to any House near the Sea-side, from any Persons of whose Honesty they are not perfectly well assured.</p>
            <p>AS I happen'd to be very gayly dressed, one of the Officers took particular Notice of me, and said, I should belong to his Regiment, and not be upon the Footing of a common Soldier, but a <rs id="OA17430412-occupation-66" type="occupation">Cadet</rs>

However I had not been long in the Regiment, before my Uncle, who was a Captain in the French Service, happened to hear that I belong'd to a Captain who was his particular Acquaintance. Accordingly one Day he paid my Captain a Visit, and asked him if he had not a young Man in his Company whose Name was Cavenagh: Yes, I have, answered the Captain, but why do you ask? Because, replied my Uncle, he is my Nephew, if it is the same, as I believe it is. Upon which the Captain sent for me, and immediately my Uncle knew me, and gave another young Man in my Room: I went then into the Company that belong'd to my Uncle; but had not been there a Month, before I thought of some Stratagem to get away, for I had no Notion of a Soldier's Life, especially in the French Service: I judged, however, it would be a difficult Matter to get away without any Money in my Pocket, which put me upon contriving how I might supply myself; nor was I long at a Loss, for I having seen my Uncle put his Money often in a little Beauroe, which I thought I could easily break open, I got a little Chissel, and when he was in Company one Day at a Tavern, with some of his Brother Officers, I took the Opportunity, broke open the Beauroe</p>

Pray, Sir, said one of the Officers, don't let that trouble you, for if you want any, you shall have some of me: with that he puts his Hand in his Pocket, and lent me five Guineas, which I told him my Uncle would pay him faithfully, with Thanks; though at the same Time I knew I told him a Lie.

I staid there about two Hours, and setting in a Room which look'd into the Road, I saw Mr. Kelly the Dancing-Master, riding by with my Great Coat on his Back.

            <p>ABOUT a Week after this Robbery, I stop'd a Gentleman and his Servant near the same Place, where I committed the last Robbery: First I made the Gentleman dismount, and then I ordered the Servant to take the Money out of his Master's Pockets, which was four Guineas, and nine Shillings in Silver, and his Watch; then I demanded the Servants Money likewise, all the while setting on my Mare, with a Pistol in my Hand; the Servant pleaded very hard, and begged I would not rob him; for said he, you see what Station I am in; but I was deaf to his Intreaties, being resolved, like Death, to spare none, and accordingly insisted upon his delivering what he had, which was about ten Shillings, he having no Watch; at last, however, the poor Fellow continuing to beg very hard, I return'd him his Money back again. He had a Portmanteau behind him, however, which I made him cut open, and in it was a Suit of Cloaths, with half a dozen fine Holland Shirts, which I told him, were fit for my Use; upon which, I ordered him to give them to me, which he accordingly did, and I put them in my Pockets</p>

When he had done relating to his Friends the Particulars of this Robbery, one of them asked him, if he should know the Highwayman again, if ever he should meet him? Know him again, says he, I should know him from a Hundred, for I took particular Notice of him all the Time he was committing the Robbery; upon hearing him say so, I immediately call'd for to Pay, and I made the best of my Way out of the House, for fear of being taken, to my Lodgings, which I should not like.</p>
            <p>ABOUT a Fortnight after, I stopp'd a Gentleman's Coach near the same Place, wherein was three Ladies and a Gentleman; I commanded the Coachman to get down from his Box, and walk off to some Distance, and in the mean Time, with my Pistol in my Hand, I stood by the Coach-side, for fear they should convey any Thing away: I took from the three Ladies two Mourning Rings, three Diamond Rings, and two plain Gold Rings, and three Purses, which contain'd about five Pounds; After I had robbed the Ladies, I demanded of the Gentleman his Money and Watch, which was four or five Guineas in Gold, and 4 or 5 Shillings in Silver, and his Gold Watch; then I ordered the Coachman to get on his Coach-box, and made him drive back upwards of a Quarter of a Mile, because they were going the same Road as I was, 'till I thought I was out of Danger.

            <p>THE next Night I went again to the same Place, where I stopt two Butchers, who were going to Exeter-Market; I took from them about seven Pounds and a Watch; they desired I would return them some Silver to bear their Charges to that City; upon which I put my Hand into my Pocket, throw'd them three Half-Crowns, and bid them drink my Health, and then I rode off again for <placeName id="OA17430412-geo-140">

            <p>I staid at that City about a Month; and while I was there, carried one of my Watches</p>

            <p>which was out of Order, to a Watchmaker's in the Town to have it mended; going one Evening to see if it was done, I found the Master of the Shop asleep by the Fire-side; and seeing in the Shop about twenty Watches hanging upon Peggs, amongst which was my own: I took this Opportunity whilst the Master was asleep, nobody else being there, to borrow about seven of the Watches (leaving my own behind) and put them in my Pocket, which done, I went directly Home to my Lodgings. The next Day I returned again to the Watch-maker's to see if my Watch was mended, and found the poor Man in a great deal of Trouble, as may well be imagined; he told me, he had been robb'd the Nigh before by some Villains, of seven Watches; but Sir, says he, they have not taken yours: Says I, seemingly with Concern for the Man's Loss, how did they rob you? Why, about eight o'Clock last Night, I was dozing by my Fire-side, they took that Opportunity; but little did he think he was telling the Story to the Thief. Well, says I, is my Watch done? Yes Sir, here it is; I asked him what he must have? he told me Half a Crown; accordingly I gave it him, and thought it very cheap, considering I had seven other Watches into the Bargain.</p>

Accordingly I went about 2 Miles from Plymouth, where I stopt a Clergyman and his Servant, bidding them stand and deliver, or else I would blow their Brains out.

To make this appear more credible, I said I had several Correspondents at China, to whom I pretended to write Letters, and talk'd of expecting large Sums of Money, which were to be remitted in Tea and China-ware, in Return of what was due to me from that Place; and as I was well versed in Duttald's, and other Authors Accounts of China, the Project took very well; for Mynheer Snider, with whom I lodg'd, taking a Liking to me, proposed his Daughter in Marriage, whose Fortune was 500 l. But I knew very well the Design of Mr. Snider was not to conclude the Marriage till the Effects arrived, (which if he had staid for, might have been long enough) so I did not seem to be very forward, but courted the young Lady privately, and soon insinuated myself so far into her good Graces, that I could do almost every Thing with her.</p>

            <p>most gone, and the Time almost expired that my Goods were to come, so that if I did any Thing it must be speedily. In order to accomplish this, I took the young Lady aside one Day, and taking her by the Hand, told her, My Passion was so great, that I would inevitably destroy myself, if she would not consent to become my Wife. At last, by many artful Persuasions I gained from her a Promise: Then I told her I desired, that if she had the least Respect for me, not to let her Father know any Thing of the Matter (for I was sure he would not consent till the pretended Effects were come from China.) The young Girl promised she would not: Then I told her I designed to make her a Present of a Gold Watch, and a Diamond Ring, which would amount to 200 l. so if she could by any Means contrive to lend me that Sum unknown to her Father, (who living a Widower left his Cash under his Daughter's Care) she poor innocent Girl, greedy with the Hopes of having two such valuable Presents, soon agreed to my Request, which to make sure of, I actually bespoke of a Dutch Jew, and the Jew coming with the Watch and Ring, I desired he would leave it for the Lady's Approbation, to which he (knowing Old Mr. Snider to be a Man of Worth) readily consented: The next Day the Jew calling again, I told him I would give him an Order upon Mr. Snider, payable in six Days for the Money, which he readily accepted. This done, I got the young Girl (who had the Keys of her Father's Treasure) to let me have the Money privately, which I likewise promis'd to pay in six Days at farthest, and with which she was very well pleased, as knowing her Father would not miss it in that Time.</p>
            <p>NEXT Day, however being in Company privately with the young Girl, who was that Day dress'd, (her Father being gone upon some Business to the Hague, from which he was not to return in three Days) with the Diamond Ring upon her Finger, and the Watch by her Side; having a Mind to have them as the Money, told her that there was a Fault in the Watch, I had not before observed; so desired she would let me carry it to Meshullam the Jew to have it rectify'd; she readily consented, I told her also, I would get the Diamond better Set, which all could be done against the next Day, so took them both, and instead of going to the Jews, made the best of my Way for <placeName id="OA17430412-geo-177">

            <p>THE young Lady, as I heard afterwards, sat very patiently for some Time, but finding me not return, sent to Meshullam's the Jew, and finding I had not been there, was surpriz'd, as yet not suspecting the real Cause. But waiting the next Day, and the Day after that, she began to be very uneasy: Her Father coming the third Day, and enquiring for Mr. Cavenagh, she durst not tell him how long he had been gone; but he going into his Closet soon after, and missing a large Sum of Money, was almost mad; coming out in a Rage, who should he meet but the Jew, who was just then come to demand his Money; Meshullam holding out his Paper, and making many Cringes, told him he would not have been so exact, but - But what, Rascal! cried Mr. Snider, I owe you no Money as I know of. Don't you so, says the Jew, but here's your Son-in-Law's Order for 200 l. This putting Mr. Snider into a still greater Passion, they were near going to Blows; however after his Passion was somewhat abated, he called for his Daughter, and asked her what was become of Mr. Cavenagh, the China-Merchant? Upon which she immediately fell on her Knees, and discovered the whole Matter, and Mr. Snider immediately sent after him, but he was vanish'd like the Lady's - Hopes - but not with empty Pockets.</p>

When I came there, I liv'd after a gay Manner, for about two Months; when my Money being almost expended, I was oblig'd to rack my little Wits how to get more. During the Stay at this Place, I had got acquainted with an old Anabaptist Teacher, that was worth Money, and had insinuated myself so far in this Person's Favour, that he used to be very fond of me, and visiting me very often, we used to have frequent Disputes concerning Religion, till at last Matters being ripe for my Purpose, I pretended that my Conscience troubled me very much, that I had been sprinkled in my Infancy, and not dipp'd; and added, if I could be dipp'd privately, it would be a great Satisfaction to me. This Saying much rejoiced the old Gentleman, who thought that he had brought me now over to his Way of Thinking. He told me, therefore, that if I had a Mind to be dipped, he had a Cold Bath in a back Place in his House, that was used on purpose for those Occasions. I answered with abundance of seeming Joy, I would embrace the Opportunity, and wait on him in a Day or two, in order to perform this Ceremony which I had so long desired.</p>
            <p>NOW I had often been very watchful to see where the old Gentleman put his Money, which at last I found out; and the Day being come, in which I was to be dipped, I repaired to the old Gentleman's House; when I came there, I found him at Prayers, and very Devout for bringing me over to his Persuasion; as soon therefore as I entered the Room where the old Gentleman was, without any farther Ceremony, I kneeled down likewise, and after we had prayed about the Space of an Hour, we both arose, when I pretending that I would not have the Maid know any thing of the Matter; the old Gentleman call'd her, and told her, if she would, she might go out for an Hour or two, and so she was dispatch'd out of the Way, which was all I wanted.

            <p>GOOD PEOPLE,</p>
            <p>" I AM brought hither to suffer an untimely " and shameful Death, for a lawless and " more shameful Life. Would to Heaven I " had thought so before it had been too late, " I had not then be brought to this Place, to " be a Gazing-Stock to Mankind; a miserable " End, for a miserable Life: Heaven sanctify " it to my Soul! What makes my Case the " worse, is, it was neither Want of Sense, nor " Want of Ability to get a handsome Living, " in an honest Way, which has brought me " to this ignominious Punishment. No, it was " my own lewd Inclination, and Hatred to " Confinement, or Work of any Sort. Let all " my Countrymen, if any of them are here, " take Warning by my unhappy Fate.</p>
            <p>" HERE I am now, in a few Minutes " comes Death, and then comes Judgment. " Aye! but what Kind of Judgment? Not a " a Temporal Judgment, that condemns me to " a Temporal and Momentary Death, but a final Judgment, where I am to hear a Sentence " which sends me either to eternal Happiness or " Misery; which I have best deserved, God " and my own Conscience knows too well; but "Thanks to a Gracious Redeemer, it is not " my own Demerits will condemn me, whilst " his Merits can plead for me: The Lord apply them unto my sinful Soul! And why " not? The Mercy of our Saviour is still the " same; and I am not the first Thief who has " gone from the fatal Tree to Paradise. I will " hope the best.</p>
            <p>" MY dear, good Fellow-Subjects, assist me " with your Prayers till I shall be no more, " especially in my last Agonies, when I am not " able to pray for myself. 'Tis a dreadful Prospect, Heaven strengthen me to go through it! " And now I cooly look back upon my past misspent Life, what better could be expected " from it? I begun with robbing my Master, " who used me very kindly. I practiced next " upon my own Uncle, who took me from under another Officer into his own Company, " that he might have an Opportunity to treat " me the more favourably, and prefer me as Occasion offered: But nothing would make any " Impression upon me, nothing would satisfy " me, but that lewd, loose Course of Life, " which has brought me hither, but too " justly.</p>
            <p>" AND now, my dear loving Countrymen, " (for so will I call you, though I was born in " Ireland, since we are all Subjects to the same " Prince) I am going to pay my Life a Forfeit " to the Laws; it is all they require; but be " not you more severe than they; do not hate " me beyond Death, do not persecute me when " in the Grave, by reflecting upon my Wife " and innocent Relations, whose Counsel, if I " would have taken, and by whom if I would " have been ruled, I had avoided coming to " this shameful Place. The Lord be as much " their Comfort, as I have been their Shame, " Sorrow, and Heart-breaking.</p>
            <p>" NOTHING now remains, but to desire your hearty and fervent Prayers for my poor departing Soul. Oh! Dear Saviour, remember</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174304120014"/>
            <p>" me now thou art in thy Kingdom! In Thee " alone, and thy precious Blood, shed for such " miserable, self-condemned Sinners as me, do " I trust. Lord, I owe much, I have nothing " to pay, do Thou frankly forgive me All, as " I frankly forgive all Men! Let my Soul be " precious in thy Sight! Present my Dying " Groans unto Thy Father; sprinkle them and " the Mercy-Seat with thy Blood! Cloath me " with Thy Righteousness, and receive me into Thy Bosom. Amen, sweet Jesus, Amen. " The Lord have Mercy upon my sinful " Soul!</p>

            <p>O Lot! that is not in your Power, neither am I afraid of you in the least, for that I have made you no fault, and that you cannot say to me. Notwithstanding, I am sorry for you, to hear you, a dying Man, utter Vengeance with your Tongue, when your Heart should think only of Mercy: I should be glad to hear that you in the bottom of your Heart, was truely sensible of your Sins, and the Sinfulness of your Heart, and then, (notwithstanding that I have been a great Sufferer by you) I should from the bottom of my Heart Rejoice; for Heart Conviction of Sin, is the first Step to true Repentance, and unless you be made sensible of the Sins of your Soul, you will not then much Regard what becomes of your Body, after your Soul is departed and gone from it. I therefore could wish that you would not look any more to be help'd by me, for I have done what I can; and now I resign you into the Hands of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who was crucified for my Sins and not for mine only, but also for the Sins of the whole World; and if you are sensible of your sinful Heart, you may find Mercy in his Blood, which was shed for Sinners, and I shall not cease to pray for you so long as you live in this World, for I freely forgive you the Evil that you have done to me, from the Bottom of my Heart; and I hope the Lord will forgive you also.</p>

            <p>ONE Evening as they were out upon their Prey they met with a Gentleman who was very much in Liquor. Bewley went up to him, and said, Sir, I perceive you are very much in for it, let me and my Friends take Care of you, and see you safe Home; Honest Friends, said the Gentleman, I thank you, you all seem to be very civil Gentlemen, I don't care if you do, but let us drink together first; withal our Hearts, cries Bewley, and the rest of his Companions; accordingly they all went to a Public-House in <placeName id="OA17430412-geo-197">

As they were going along, they led him into a narrow Passage, and then they told him they must borrow that Purse of Money of him. Money, Gentlemen! What is it you mean? Come, come, Sir, says Bewley, Gentlemen of our Profession are not to be triffled with. Gentlemen, said the Stranger, I took you to be very honest Persons, and I hope you are only in jest.

Bewley then asked him, where he lived, and promised he would in a few Days return him his Money again with Thanks, protesting they would not have taken it from him, but they had a present Occasion for just such a Sum. The Surprize of taking his Money from him, had made him something soberer than he was, so he very readily told them, they might hear of him at Change Hours at Garraway's Coffee-House, he being an Exchange-Broker.

Such is the miserable Fate of these poor Wretches, to ventre their Necks to enrich a Pack of vile Receivers, worse than themselves, who run away with the most of the Profit.</p>
            <p>SOMETIME after this Robbery, Bewley was taken up for robbing a Person of some Rabbits, and by the Persuasion of a Thief-taker he turn'd Evidence, put Miller into his Information, and inform'd one of the Thief-takers where he might take him. Accordingly he went, and Miller happened to be at the Place, but he made his Escape, by getting out of one of the Windows of the House, and got entirely off. Sessions coming on, Bewley was brought to the Bar in Order to take his Trial, but no Proscecutor appearing he was discharged. Sometime after this, Miller * was taken up for stealing a Tea-Kettle out of a Shop in Fleet-street, was tried for it at the Old-Bailey, found guilty, and ordered for Transportation.</p>
            <p>WHEN Bewley had got his Liberty, and Miller was transported, he was at a Loss to get a Fellowman; at last he bethought himself of his old Companion <persName id="OA17430412n98-99">

Bewley, for three Quarters of a Year before he was apprehended, had always used to carry a dark Lanthorn and a Chissel about him; and when he saw he had an Opportunity to rob any House, he would go and light his Candle at a Neighbour's just by; when he had so done, he put it into the Dark Lanthorn, and then concealed it in his Bosom, between his Coat and Waistcoat, shutting it close that nobody could see that he had any Light, and then to work he went, while Clay stood Peter &#8224;. If he found that the Sashes of any House would not go up, then he would take his Chissel, which he brought for that Purpose, and wrench'd them open till they would go up very easily, and by this Means it was that he got into the Parlour of the abovementioned House, and stript it of what Things were there, as Plate, Linnen, Cloaths, &amp;c. for having bundled up what he got in a large Sheet, he gave them out of Window to Clay, who stood ready to receive them. This done, they both made off undiscovered, and carried the Goods to a certain Jew, who bought them very readily; the Linnen and Cloaths we sold for six Pounds, and the Plate for four Shillings per Ounce.</p>

There he unfortunately lost 30 l. the first Night; but flattering himself with the hopes of having better Fortune another Time, he went another Night, and then instead of regaining what he Lost, had the Misfortune to loose his ALL, which was the whole remainder of the 180 l. with which Money he intended to have made his Progress to Paris. Being then left destitute in a strange City, of both Friends and Money, and reduced even to the utmost Necessity, having Pledg'd most of his Apparel, and being at last compell'd to Sell even his Hat to buy himself a morsel of Meat: In short, being even tir'd of Life, he resolved upon attacking Mr. Belcher the Surgeon as he did, in the following Manner; but solemnly protested he never intended to hurt him. First, he made him a Visit, as a Patient, pretending unfortunately to have caught the Venereal Disease, and acquainting him with the several Symptoms he felt; as also that having heard a great Character of him, it had induced him, tho' a Stranger, to apply to him, preferably to any other, and offering him five Guineas for the Cure; he concluded, with desiring Mr. Belcher to prepare him proper Medicines, against the next Evening, about 5 o'Clock, when he wou'd not fail to call for them, at that</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174304120019"/>
            <p>Time he could not conveniently stay, having some Gentlemen waiting for him.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, the next Night about the Hour appointed, Mr. Wright, otherwise Brown, came to Mr. Belcher's, and knocking at the Door, the Servant immediately came and let him in; upon which Mr. Wright, ask'd if Mr. Belcher was at Home; the Servant told him he was, desired him to Walk in, and strait way lighted him into the Room; after the Servant was gone out, he took a view of the Room, to see if there was any more Door's but one, and afterwards he seated himself in a carless Posture by the Fire. When Mr. Belcher, entered the Room, affected to be a Buckling his Shoes; upon Mr. Belcher's approaching him he seem'd not to see him till he came near the Fire: After passing a few Compliments, Mr. Belcher took out of his Pocket the Medicines he had prepared; (Mr. Brown begged the Favour of Mr. Belcher, that he would not let any of his Servants know his Misfortune,) and set them upon the Table, after which, he got up, took some of the Druggs, and smell'd to them, and seemingly affected to Cough at the Smell, but all of a sudden, taking out a Pistol, and presenting it to the Body of Mr. Belcher, at the same time, desiring him not to be surprized, nor make any Noise; he assured him, that he was drove to the utmost Distress, and that Necessity compell'd him to Attack him in that Manner.</p>
            <p>MR. Belcher was very much Surpriz'd, as may be well imagin'd, and his Countenance chang'd; however, after he had a little recover'd himself, he put his Hand in his Pocket, and gave Mr. Brown two Guineas; upon which he said, that wou'd not do, he must have more. Mr. Belcher then desir'd him to put his Pistol up, and he wou'd give him what Money he had. Accordingly upon his Request, he did put the Pistol into his Pocket, keeping his Thumb upon the Cock, to prevent its going off. Mr. Belcher then pull'd out three Guineas more, with some Silver; when Mr. Brown perceiving the Chain of his gold Watch, demanded that likewise of Mr. Belcher, who was very unwilling to part with it. But Mr. Brown finding him delay, and not having Patience, pull'd it out himself, and as he was putting it into his Pocket, with the Money, Mr. Belcher observing him not to be upon his Guard, seiz'd him by the Arms, and push'd him back over a Chair, so that they both fell over upon the Ground: Mr. Belcher however, being uppermost kept his Hold, and call'd out Murder, and his Servants immediately enter'd the Room, where they found them in the Posture aforesaid.

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174304120020"/>
            <p>' for the Benefit of your Fellow-Subjects, if it ' shall please his Majesty to spare you. This, Sir, ' is the only Thing I can think of, and also the ' last Effort that can be made for you: I'll endeavour all I possibly can to prevail on my Brother to get it presented, and if he should deny ' it me, I'll endeavour to get it done by some of ' his Majesty's Council. Delay not this one Moment; let me have it To-morrow Morning early, there being no Time to be lost; above all ' let it be quite open and true; hide not any thing. ' It grieves me to think I can give you only this ' faint Shadow of Success, this poor glimmering ' Light of Hopes. Therefore for the Sake of your ' eternal Happiness, let not this distant View flatter you in the least; let it not break in one ' Moment on the short time appointed you to live, ' but with the Sincerity becoming a Christian, ' make a thorough Repentance, and a pious Resignation of yourself: Be not intimidated, depend ' more in the Mercy of the Almighty, than in ' our own Merit; rest assured, that thro' his infinite Wisdom, whatsoever is to become of you, ' will be the best for you. I conclude with most ' humbly imploring the Almighty Father and our ' blessed Saviour, that this Cup may pass from ' you, but if not, may his Sovereign Will be ' done, and you enabled to glorify him in this his ' righteous Dispensation. I shall continue to pray ' for you, and otherwise serve you to the utmost ' of my Power. Pray let me hear from you Tomorrow Morning. In the mean while I abide,</p>
            <p>Your real Friend and Well-wisher.</p>

            <p>April 1, 1743.</p>
            <p>DEAR SIR,</p>
            <p>I Wrote to Mr. Dillon on Monday last, to beg his utmost Assistance at this Exigence: he wrote a very kind Answer, wherein he declared his Willingness to serve, provided I could put him in a Way to do it effectually; he mentioned in his Letter, that he had sent to Ireland for a Certificate, whereby to satisfy, not alone my Prosecutor, but other Gentle-men who interested themselves in my Cause; but at that Time, said, he had no Return of an Answer: On Wednesday last, I received the agreeable News that the Certificate was come, which he immediately sent to Mr. Belcher, who seing it certified, and attested by Mr Harper, and twenty three Gentlemen more (all of them great Men) declared now, that he was well ascertain'd of the Truths I had formerly told him; he would use his utmost Interest to obtain a Reprieve, which he did not doubt of succeeding in. I would have wrote before this to you, but could not give you so satisfactory Account. Pardon this Prolixity, and you'll oblige Yours,</p>

            <p>The following LETTER he sent to a Gentlewoman, some few Days before his Execution.</p>
            <p>MADAM.</p>
            <p>YOU may perhaps be surprized at the first Sight of this. But when you recollect and consider, that it comes from the unhappy <persName id="OA17430412n123-1">

                  <interp inst="OA17430412n123-1" type="given" value="STEPHEN"/>Stephen Wright</persName>, which Name I went by to you, your Amazement then must Vanish, and Pity take its Place. Whether you have, or have not as yet heard of my miserable Condition, the Almighty God best is a Judge, I am not. - But this I must acquaint you, that now I am under the just Sentence of Death, and do shortly expect to appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ; but how shall I look my dear Redeemer in the Face, or whether shall I fly? - Had I never seen that unhappy Place my Lord Moddlington's, I trust I had not now been here; when I came to London, my Intentions were good; but too easily was I drawn into that Snare, which now my weeping Eyes, and aking Heart Repents. Oh! may my ever Gracious God forgive me my manifold Sins. My dearest Friend Mr. John W - I long to see; I conjure him by the living God, to come unto me before I go hence, and am no more seen. I heartily, and sincerely dear Madam, beg your Prayers for my poor Soul. Whilst I am, I'll think of you, and when I am dead, may my Shade for ever rest in Paradise, where you may come to the now Wretched, though then Blessed,</p>
