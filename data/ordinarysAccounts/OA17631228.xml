But here, luckily for the publick safety, he was mistaken in his mark, and fell upon a house well inhabited by a master Carpenter and his workmen: The former, awakened by the noise of wrenching open the frame of a cellar window, alarmed two or three of his men, who came upon him, and with some difficulty seized and secured him; in effecting of which, by means of his resisting and endeavouring to escape in the dark, he had received two unlucky strokes, one with a pistol and another with a hanger, both on the head; by which he was wounded, and made more deaf and stupid than he was before, for he laboured under both those defects during the time between sentence and execution. After he was apprehended, he was found to be furnished with a tinder-box, a dark-lantern, a candle, and an iron bar flatted at one end. A silver spoon was also found upon him, the property of Mr. Hill, the prosecutor.</p>
            <p>He had the artifice to plead on his trial, that he was non compos, out of his mind, and knew not what he did. But being reminded by the Court that his situation was very serious, and no proof of this assertion being offered, it was urged no farther. After conviction and sentence passed, he still appeared to be very hard of hearing and dull of apprehension; so that it was a difficult task to instruct and prepare him, whether this was real or partly affected.

            <p>After he had been daily visited, assisted with prayers, and the plainest instructions, he was now and then questioned what progress he had made in his preparation for an awful change; but could give very little satisfaction in that matter, only said, he would trust to Providence; meaning, that he would give no farther account of his past life, nor confess any other facts; tho' he did not pretend to</p>

            <p>When he found himself included in the Death-warrant, it did not much affect him, as he seemed to expect it. Endeavours were renewed to prepare him for the holy communion; but with no better success; he pleaded he had lost his memory, as well as his apprehension; and that what he read or heard made little impression, and was quickly gone from him; so that he seemed incapable of celebrating that sacred act of remembrance. However, there seemed to be a greater want of disposition than capacity. To arouse and quicken him, therefore, to a sense of his duty in this respect, he was permitted to be present, and very near, at the administration of the communion in the chapel, the day before he suffered; so as that he could hear and see all that was spoken, or done, without admitting him to partake of it. Several intelligent good neighbours were present now, and on other occasions, who took opportunities to speak familiarly to him before and after service, in order to bring him to a better disposition. But neither did these means kindle in him that desire, which we hoped. He still continued in a languid indifference. As he could still read, and as his last evening was now come, a brief but excellent little tract on spiritual communion was put into his hands, to assist and raise his thoughts this last night of his life. He returned it to me the next morning, and said he had read it. Being asked whether he understood it, and applied it to himself? he replied, he did, as well as God gave him leave; his usual answer to such questions.</p>

Endeavours were used to reason him out of this very groundless and weak resolution, and proper books put into his hands for that purpose, particularly a Protestant Catechism and a New Testament, both which he soon after returned, without suffering them to make any good impression upon him.

For, either he could not be convinced it was his duty, or else he could not be persuaded to comply with it; still persisting to say, that his memory was so bad he could not recollect any fact, or he did not see what use or satisfaction it could give the world, or any injured person, to confess it. To set this in a strong light before him, a plain case was put; Suppose you had been robbed, would it not give you satisfaction to know who did it? And what is become of him? Whether living or dead? Whether hardened and going on still in his wickedness, or penitent and reformed, at least past the power of offending any more. Would it not be a great ease and benefit to you to put an end to your doubts and suspicions? Would it not be the same to innocent persons, who might be suspected, to be cleared of those doubts and suspicions? Surely it might, to the saving of their character, their liberty, and their livelihood. Reason and justice, no less than our rational religion and our excellent church, join in requiring this mark of sincere repentance from dying criminals: And let those who teach, or think, or act otherwise, see to it.</p>
            <p>There is the more reason to speak thus freely, because this duty is too often made a stumbling-block to several unhappy persons under sentence, whose preparation is obstructed, and rendered more difficult, by the contrary poisonous principles sown in the prison by some disguised enemy; tho' it must be owned there is no need of this, while the native pride and corruption of the human heart, unmortified, are sufficient to harden it against this duty, and every act of self-abasement.</p>
            <p>In a word, I could form no apology in my own mind for this criminal not complying with this duty, but his defect of apprehension and memory before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>We used the Litany, and other proper acts of devotion in the chapel, in which he joined tolerably well for the most part. After which he was directed to meditate on proper subjects, or read in the way to the place. When he went down from the chapel, which was about twenty minutes before nine, he was asked, Are you resigned? He answered in the affirmative. Do you find peace and hope in your breast, on a sure foundation? He replied faintly in the same manner.</p>
            <p>The other three convicts of the church of Rome, were kept ready in their cells, not in the Press-Yard, or Little hall, as usual, for what reason, as I did not enquire, so I did not learn. But all were detained about an hour later than usual, till after ten, on account, as it was said, of some necessary part of the apparatus not being provided in time.</p>

Being secured and hand-cuffed, he confessed this and other robberies. In his defence on trial he did not deny the fact; but insisted, as he had done when taken, that he got but sixpence in halfpence from the two.</p>
            <p>This, with six other capital convicts, attended the service in the chapel on Sunday morning, Jan. 15, being the first or second day after their conviction, when their anguish was quick and poignant; they behaved with serious attention and deep humiliation; before they went up, immediately on their being brought down from the cells, a small pittance of halfpence was, by some charitable hand, sent to be distributed to each of them: a most seasonable relief to their present hunger and cold, in this new and shocking situation. When in chapel, a proper exhortation was applied to them in a serious manner; they were each of them greatly affected, but variously, according to their different tempers. Several of them wept, especially the two young women; others bewailed themselves with loud cries: Some wrung their hands, looking up intensely to Heaven for that mercy, which they had forfeited and lost sight of in this world.

            <p>On Tuesday the 17th of January, when brought to the bar to receive sentence, an occasion which commanded a deep and awful silence! a striking sense of their sad situation was pathetically impressed upon them; they were reminded, that by their several crimes they had now made the law their enemy; (that law which should be the safe-guard and protection of all honest men.) That they had now no friend but God, whose ears are ever open to the penitent; to whom they were exhorted to apply themselves for peace and reconciliation, and to whose mercy their souls were finally recommended, while their bodies were doomed to death.</p>
            <p>Conformable to this, they seemed for the present to fall in with the design of</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176312280009"/>
            <p>this heavy judgment, this most alarming call to repentance and amendment: And to awaken and assist them, proper books were put into the hands of such as could read, and they were directed to use them for their own benefit and of those who could not read, of which there were three or four. Proper Scriptures were also selected, and daily opened and applied to them, as usual. On this occasion the 26th chapter of Leviticus was read to them as a proper lesson, wherein the fears and hopes of transgressors are applied to, with the most powerful threats and promises: Considerations well adapted not only to particulars when visited with afflictions, but to this whole nation and people as dispersed from East to West over the face of the globe, now labouring under various chastisements, and justly apprehensive of more and greater, if not mercifully averted. Let such divine admonitions as these be laid to heart, and applied to this purpose. Levit. xxvi. 23 - 33. And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me; then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins; and I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant. - And when I have broken the staff of your bread - ye shall eat and not be satisfied. And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you. And your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. - Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths.</p>
            <p>But to invite and encourage us to avert or remove these terrible inflictions by a speedy and humble repentance, hearken to the gracious voice of Divine Mercy. (Ibid. ver. 40, &amp;c.) If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they have trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me, and that I also have walked contrary unto them: - If THEN their uncircumcised hearts be hnmbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity, then will I remember my covenant. - And I will remember the land. And they shall accept the punishment of their iniquity, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes. These and the like Scriptures were duly set before them, as they occurred; and tho' now and then some of them seemed to grow restive, and relapse into their foolish imaginations and evil habits, yet upon the whole a remarkable change seemed to be working among them. Some hopeful progress and improvement appeared to be made among the most hardy of them, and more so among the more pliant and tractable.</p>
            <p>One of the former sort, who must at present be nameless, gave me to understand, on the second or third day after his conviction, that he wanted to have some private conversation with me. For this purpose an opportunity was given him the next morning before prayers, when, instead of opening his many scenes of guilt, and asking advice, direction, and comfort, he declared himself innocent of the charge he was convicted of as the child unborn, and desired to be put in a way of applying effectually to save his life. He was answered, that I was no less surprized at this declaration of his innocence, than at his entire mistaking the nature of my office, which was not to meddle with their temporal affairs, but to minister to and assist them in their more important spiritual concerns, and endeavour to secure to them a pardon and peace more lasting than this world can give: Acquainting him withal, that he might</p>

            <p>fairly apply for mercy to the Throne, by proper persons and means, if there were a foundation for it; but cautioning him against false pleas and pretences of innocence. This reproof and advice, it is hoped, was not wholly fruitless.</p>
            <p>But to return to the convict who is the immediate object of our present consideration. <persName id="OA17631228n53-1">

            <p>The person in whose hand this petition was, and who was active in forwarding it, being a publican in the Minories, said, that Anderson had lodged some time in his house, and gave him a good character for his honesty, declaring he had many opportunities of stealing from him, but he never missed any thing; that he believed this to be his first fact; and that his friends and acquaintance would have come to his character on his trial, had they known of it. It must be owned, his aspect and manner of behaviour had the appearance of a plain, honest, poor man, however he might of late be seduced. The event shews, this petition had not the desired success.</p>
            <p>One of his fellow-convicts who could read, <persName id="OA17631228n56-1">
                  <interp inst="OA17631228n56-1" type="gender" value="male"/>

Besides which, they had daily a short instruction given them in some part of the preparation previous to the holy communion. And having notice given them to observe Feb. the first as a day of humiliation, prayer, and fasting, they all willingly joined in at least an outward observance of it: wherein, besides the Psalms of the day and the second lesson being opened, and select parts of them applied as usual, a first lesson (Joel, chap. ii.) was also chosen and explained; and the Commination-office was used.</p>
            <p>In the morning of this day, before prayers, one of the convicts applied to</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176312280011"/>
            <p>me in the name of the rest, desiring to defer the administration of the holy Communion, for that they did not think themselves as yet prepared for it. This arose from a gross error in not distinguishing the Word or Office of Commination (which they had been warned to read before, in private,) from Communion; a mistake very natural to these unhappy persons, who had seldom or never used or thought on either of these two very distinct and quite different Offices. Immediate care was taken to rectify this mistake, by giving them a proper and distinct notion of the meaning and design of each Office. So gross is the ignorance of the first principles of Christianity, and the plain contents of our Common-Prayer book, which prevails among the untaught and undisciplined multitude; professing, indeed, the reformed or established Religion; but, in the present Confusion of Tongues, by different sects, names, and parties, losing the great ends of true religion, Knowledge, Love, and Obedience: and being filled with that bigotry, and uncharitable rancour ever arising from causeless divisions.</p>
            <p>When Anderson found himself included in the Death-warrant, he was much dejected; he wept and bewailed himself, and could scarce be comforted for some days. His usual calm countenance was now disturbed and overcast. His fears and sorrows prevailed over those hopes which he lately entertained, and professed of making his peace with Heaven. He still attended the chapel, and gave heed, with some composure and attention, to those instructions and consolations offered from the holy Scriptures. On this occasion the history of the sufferings of the great sacrifice, and example for suffering sinners, fell in the course of the lessons, out of St. Mark chap. xiv. and xv. Besides which, some select chapters out of the Proverbs, Isaiah, Genesis chap. xxii. and Hebrews xii. were read to them. These and other means seemed to bring Anderson, and his fellow sufferer Thompson, to a more calm and resigned temper.</p>
            <p>As for Prince he seemed to bear the expected stroke with more equanimity. The respited convicts were removed from the cells to the other side. To assist Anderson and Thompson in private, a prisoner on the Press-yard side, named Folliott, not yet tried, who reads well, was employed and permitted to read to them in their cells, for some hours, during their three last days; they were much pleased with this help, and made some good use of it. A good account is given of their attention and piety on this occasion. About this time Anderson told me, he had strove to ask and obtain pardon of all whom he had wronged; that he had desired one of his fellow convicts to write to his prosecutors, the two women who had sworn his life away (as he expressed it) for that purpose, and that he freely forgave them, and should die in charity with them; he mentioned also a labouring farmer at Wilsden, whose house he had broke into, and robbed.</p>
            <p>The day preceding their execution was now come, and they had not yet desired to be partakers of the holy Sacrament, tho' daily instructed for it, and reminded of their obligation to it. They seemed rather diffident and disinclined to come to it, tho' this was the last appointed day, and some good neighbours were come in to help their infirmities, and set them a good example. To remove their difficulties, scruples, and fears, two hours extraordinary were spent with them, which</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176312280012"/>
            <p>at length were blessed with the intended good success; they all three, including Mr. Prince, made full and open profession of the several requisites to a due preparation, and were admitted with joy and satisfaction.</p>

            <p>The general behaviour of this convict, who was totally illiterate, having been partly described in the preceding article, need not be repeated, only observing, that he was more alarmed, and more deeply touched at being named for execution in the Death-warrant, than either of the other two; whether he had thought less of preparing for this trying moment, and flattered himself more to his greater disappointment; or whether there was some hidden sting in his conscience (a quicker sense of which might now be awakened) did not yet appear.</p>

Being questioned how long he had been concerned in such practices, as that for which he was convicted; he told me he was but lately drawn in by the evidence Branch, an old offender, as he said, about a week before he was discovered, in which time they had committed five such facts. That immediately before this he had been sick for near a month, was then recovering, but reduced to great distress by want, which exposed him to this temptation. He was reminded that this was a great aggravation of his ingratitude, to distrust that good Providence, who had raised him from the bed of sickness, and to seek relief by wicked ways. This he seemed sensible of, and acknowledged the wickedness of it.</p>
            <p>It was now again laid before him a-new, that it was his duty to open his guilt, in respect of any other notorious crimes he might have been guilty of, as ever he expected pardon and peace; particularly, whether he had been on the highway, or elsewhere for such wicked purposes? He fell on his knees, and declared, he had never stopt man, woman or child, with intent to rob, in any street, highway, or field; and wished he might never find mercy if he ever had: But owned that when he plied in his bomb-boat he had been concerned in taking goods (as tobacco and sugar) out of lighters in the River, and expressed great sorrow at the remembrance of it. He also solemnly declared his innocence of any such deeds of murder, as were before-mentioned to be reported against him; and this he persisted in to the last, on the most serious and trying occasions; and procured several letters to be written, and sent to his wife and his acquaintance, to clear himself of these false and groundless charges, as he asserted them to be.</p>
            <p>On the Morning of Execution.</p>
            <p>THE two prisoners were brought down from their cells about seven, calm and resigned, and behaved very properly. It was now known that the execution of Mr. Prince was respited for three weeks, but by whose means, or for what particular reasons, seemed unknown even to himself. He chose, however, to make a right use of this forbearance, by going up to chapel with his fellow convicts, and doing his duty, as if he were to suffer with them; an act of gratitude and thanksgiving to Heaven, which the other six respited convicts have hitherto neglected. May it even now enter into their hearts, that the goodness and long suffering of God leadeth them to repentance, with obligations more prevailing to the humane and liberal mind than his severity.</p>
            <p>After prayers and administration of the holy Sacrament, in the chapel, at which were present one or two clergymen, and another serious and compassionate person, they were reminded to keep and cherish that blessing in their hearts, which they had now received, and not regard any thing that passed around them. They went down to the Press-yard, and while they were preparing to be put in the cart, behaved themselves with remarkable composure and resignation, professing they</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176312280014"/>
            <p>were not afraid, but ready and willing to die, for that they had been well advised, and prepared. This happy change for the better was the more favourable to them, now when their hour was at hand, as they had lately been in a different temper, and felt the pangs of grief, when it was more distant. Thus may all those who now sow in tears, at length reap in joy.</p>
            <p>About nine they were put into one cart hung round with black, which some of the spectators observed to be a decent distinction; they got to the place of execution about a quarter past ten, and when tied up, were again prayed for, near half an hour, in which many of the surrounding people joined.</p>
            <p>Thompson had promised to deliver to me here the copy of a letter, written to vindicate himself from the charge of murder before-mentioned, but now excused himself, by saying, he could not get it written the last night, and now again declared he knew nothing of those murders.</p>
            <p>Anderson being also questioned, whether he was ever guilty of any such fact, or privy to it, particularly the murder of the gate-keeper at Marybone turnpike, which it came into mind to ask him, because his facts were done near that quarter; he seemed at first not to take my meaning, but then denied that he knew any thing of it. Having made profession of their faith and charity, and received the final blessing, we parted, and they quickly suffered their sad sentence. The knot of Anderson's rope sliding upwards, when turned off, he was suspended lower by half his height than Thompson.</p>
