            <p>When sentence was about to be pronounced on him, and it was demanded, in the usual manner, if he had any thing to offer why it should not pass, he pleaded his youth, and that he should die innocent: But the court told him, that after a fair and even favourable trial he was found guilty, that it was with great reluctance this part of duty to the public was discharged; but it was necessary that examples should be made, of all who sell into this crime of high-way robberies, already too prevailing; he was cautioned not to suffer himself to be deluded with false hopes of life, and thereby diverted from preparing for eternity, to which he must suddenly pass.</p>
            <p>On the 28October, being visited, he attended prayers, and a proper exhortation, with devotion and seriousness, and being farther spoken to in private, he wept bitterly.</p>
            <p>After this, on proper occasions he gradually open'd himself to the following effect: That he had lived in several services for eight or nine years past as a <rs id="OA17571123-occupation-49" type="occupation">foot-boy</rs>
               <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                     targets="OA17571123n11-1 OA17571123-occupation-49"/>, Etc. since he was eleven years of age; and had left his last place about eleven months since; but not being quickly recommended to another cheifly (as he said) because he had lost an eye, by the stroke of a careless lamp-lighter's ladder, he was advised to <rs id="OA17571123-occupation-50" type="occupation">go to sea</rs>
               <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                     targets="OA17571123n11-1 OA17571123-occupation-50"/>, which he did, entering himself in the Boscawen privateer, wherein he cruised about three months; but the sea and the ships company not proving agreeable to him, he with several others quitted it, and so forfeited what little prize money was due to him. In these circumstances he pleaded necessity for those facts, he now owned he had been guilty of, which were in all about seven robberies, commited on horseback, chiefly on the <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-11">Hounslow road</placeName>, viz.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175711230005"/>
            <p>of fix four wheel'd post.chaises, and one stage Bath machine; from all which he had taken nothing but money, except the prosecutor's watch who had it again. The sum of 14 or 15l. was the most he had taken at once; this was soon spent. in a bad way.</p>
            <p>In answer to his pleading of necessity, it was urged to him, that there are many demands for honest industry; at this time in particular, the service of his king and country, which he might have complied with, instead of so prostigate a course, which is always taken up to seed vices, and not to answer necessities of nature; few honest, industrious, sober people, if any, perish for want; and that the righteous will never be wholly forsaken. That his first and greatest crime was falling from God, and distrusting his providence, that if he had truly trusted in him, who gave him that life, and that body which he was so anxiously careful to support, he could never have fallen into so grievous a crime.</p>
            <p>He now began to see and acknowledge, that the pamper'd and vicious life of a servant, with the general neglect of family instruction, or devotion, public or private, had betray'd him into this fatal distrust of God's providence, and he earnestly wished even with tears, that he had betaken himself to some honest course, instead of trusting in wrong and robbery. He now began to search his own heart, and there to find the source of his error, he remember'd the first principles of his profession, and lamented how greatly he had fallen from them; however, in some services, he said, he had been obliged to attend his duty to God, and then he always kept a good character, and was sure of a recommendation from such families, whenever he wanted. Nor was he conscious, that he had ever wronged his masters, or wasted their goods; for which he was thankful, He said he used sometimes to pray in private, and read his bible and prayer book, but often neglected it. That he first began to commit robbery in order to sit himself out for the sea, and after the last he committed, had resolved in himself, as he sat on horse-back, never to commit another; but it was matter of joy to him, that left he should relapse, he was cut short, and was now convinced, that they who seek to save life, by transgressing God's law, will find certain death.</p>
            <p>After he had thus opened himself, and freely confess'd his crimes and errors, he became daily more light, easy, and resigned.</p>
            <p>He was apprehended in the <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-12">Strand</placeName> by two soldiers, one of whom, had accidentally seen him at a beer-house in shug-lane, to whom he had given part of a pot of beer; he supposes that being advertised and described by mr. Bishop, and being remarkable for the loss of any eye, he was the more easily discover'd. He was carried before justice Fielding, and commited to <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-13">New Prison</placeName>, and advertised; on which mr. Bishop and several others, came at the day appointed for his re-examination; mr. Parker among others knew the watch,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175711230006"/>
            <p>by help of which, he was discovered, and convicted.</p>
            <p>On the 18November the warrant for his execution came, which did not greatly move him, as he had endeavoured to prepare himself for it. He now desired the favour, that one might be permitted to be in the cell with him, the few nights he had to live, to assist him in reading and prayer, when his fight should fail him, which was granted. The remaining nights, he spent chiefly in prayer, reading, and meditation in the word of God, and being ask'd each morning, how he had spent the night, he answered, very well, much to his comfort and satisfaction, that he had slept a little with quiet and composure, and when he awaked, betook himself to his devout exercises again. His companion in the cell, who assisted him in reading and prayer, gave a very good account of his calm and composed spirit, of his patience under the hand of God, and resignation to his sentence.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday the 22November, he received the holy communion very devoutly, with a fixt attention to every part of that sacred, and solemn service, together with three other prisoners who being invited, willingly joined with us. On Wenesday, 23November, the morning of execution, having communicated the day before, he was the better prepared to receive it again with comfort, which indeed he did, to the strengthening and refreshing of his soul, to enable him to meet the terrors of death with true courage, and to sustain its agonies with patience. After receiving, he was exhorted to meditate on the articles of his faith, and offer up the several petitions of the Lord's Prayer, in his way to the place of execution, with those other devotions fitted for his use, in the address to prioners, all which, he thankfully promised to do. He also returned hearty thanks for what had been done for him, in preparing him for death, and a happy change; said he felt comfort and strength, and a lively well grounded hope in his breast. When sk'd, he often repeated his trust and belief that his sins were pardon'd, on his repentance, through the merits of our blessed Saviour.</p>
            <p>He went down from chapel calm and resigned, and about half an hour after nine, was carried from prison to the place of execution, where having arrived, he joined in prayer about half an hour, and being saint and weak, he desired to be excused speaking to the people as he had intended, but beg'd they might be warned in his name, to the same purpose he had often expressed himself, which was to the following effect:</p>
            <p>"He hoped the people were not come together out of an idle curiosity, but to join with him in his earnest prayers, and to take warning by his suffering; particularly his fellow servants and brother sailors, he wish'd to avoid transgressing the commands of God, and falling away from him in any temptation; his fellow servants he warned to be regular, and constant in</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175711230007"/>
            <p>doing their duty to God first, and then to their masters, not purloining, but shewing all diligence and fidelity; to avoid rude words and answers, to order themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters, to pray constantly for grace, to abstain from all evil, and to do all the good they can, that if through any real, or imaginary offence given their masters, they should lose their place, they may have a sure refuge, putting their whole trust in the good providence of God, in all time of necessity, or distress, by some honest industry; and not turn aside to wicked ways to relieve themselves, which instead of saving their lives, must destroy them; of which truth he stood there a sad example.</p>
            <p>Masters and mistresses he said were often thought whimsical and capricious, and servants wayward, rude and undutiful, on both which accounts, places must be very uncertain, insomuch that in the space of eleven months, he saw eleven servants discharged out of one family; in all such cases the blame is thrown from one to the other. But as it is the undoubted interest of all families to have good servants, there can be little doubt, that while servants are diligent and dutiful, they will be acceptable and keep their places. He therefore intreated all servants, to learn and practise their duty as christians, and then he was sure, from what he had learned in the prison, they must be good servants, and it is no less their master's duty and interest to begin, and promote this good purpose, to set and know that their servants be true and faithful servants of God, of this, he himself was a witness and a proof. One good lady he lived with some years, took care that he went duly to church, and if absent at any time, was sure to be call'd to an account for it; by these means he behaved himself well, and had her favour and good word, both while he served her, and after he left her, and should never have wanted a recommendation to a place while she was in the way, but unhappily for him, she was out of town in his time of need. This obliged him to go to sea, where after taking two prizes he quitted the ship, and so lost his shares; he took occasion from hence, to advise all his brother sailors to be stedfast and resolute in their honest undertaking; whatever service they entered into, let it be first with due consideration, looking up to heaven for direction, that they may make a good choice, and then for success and a happy issue; but whether they meet with prosperity or adversity, let honesty, and a firm trust in God be the fixt star by which they steer all their course.s</p>
            <p>Let them carefully distinguish between fighting lawfully against the enemies of their king and country, and robbing their own countrymen and fellow subjects; for want of making this plain distinction, and keeping to it, he this day fell a sacrifice to the laws of God and man, which he had transgressed he acknowledged he died justly, and pray'd for pity and compassion on his poor soul; he added with a loud voice,</p>

            <p>This was proved on the evidence of mr.

A watch and ring were found upon him, the ring was sworn to by mr. Manners, and that it was taken from the lady in the chaise, by Green.</p>
            <p>His defence, that he was in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-17">Oxford shire</placeName> at the time of this robbery, being not proved, did not prevent his conviction. After which, his behaviour in the prison was humble, orderly and penitent, and as he freely acknowledged his crimes, he was regular and constant in all the duties of the chapel, bearing his unhappy lot with a chearful resignation, very different from the sullen hardness of those who were so fond of their crimes, that they kept them close in their own bosom.</p>
            <p>He was born at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-18">Chargrove</placeName>, but brought very young to <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-19">Wattleton</placeName> in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-20">Oxfordshire</placeName>, where he was put to school by his father, a shoemaker, taught to read and write, and say his catechism, and then learn'd the baker's trade, from the age of twelve to nineteen. About this time, he told his master his wages were too low, and he chose to go to <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-21">London</placeName>, where he lived three years with mr.

While he lived with his master Palmer, he and his wife were taken notice of as good examples for duly frequenting his parish church, and that he lived a temperate, sober, and honest life; he often said he little thought of his present misery, two months before. But disagreeing with his master, and they having some words, he left him, and was out of work, but quickly expected another place; mean time having three young children to provide for, and his rent unpaid, it was proposed to him by some comrade in an idle walk, and an unguarded hour to take this fatal course for his relief, which turned to his shame and his ruin. He acknowledged but three facts on the highway, one in the <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-25">Oxford road</placeName>, near <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-26">Southwell</placeName> the same (it may be presumed) for which he was convicted; another in the <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-27">Chelmsford-road, Essex</placeName>; and a third in the </p>

The most he got at any of these, did not exceed three or four guineas, which was divided with his accomplices; by some of whom being betrayed and his matters blown, he was pursued and taken in his fight, as beforementioned, with some of those spoils which helped to convict him. Sad purchase indeed I life and character, body, and soul for a little present gain. And 'tis strange they never think, that as sure as these unwary creatures trust one another, so surely are they betrayed. An unanswerable proof that they go upon false ground, which sinks under them.</p>
            <p>He express'd great anxiety left his wife shoud be blamed by his relations for having drawn him into this wicked course; but he decleared her intirely innocent of it, and ignorant of all the steps he took in that way.</p>
            <p>But as to his companions, he earnestly wished them to be warned by his sufferings, to for sake their wicked ways before the like just vengeance over take them.</p>
            <p>One of these, he heard, while in prison, being sent by his master with some sword hilts, and ordered to receive the money, made off with it, pretending by sham messages sent to his lodging, that he had broke his leg, and was carried to <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-30">St. Bartholomew's hospital</placeName>, but when enquired for, no such person was these.</p>
            <p>He further confess'd, he was concerned with the person now hinted at, in stealing some fowls (more than once) at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-31">Isleworth</placeName>, and warned, and warned him to abstain from all such practices for the future, for if he persist, his name is known to those who will. detect, and prosecute him.

That is, almost a mile's distance from the place, where the robbery was committed at six.</p>
            <p>Before the justice, he said he was at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-34">Tottenham</placeName> in the dusk of the evening; that is about three quarters of a mile from the Bull, on the other side. The justice order'd him to be taken there, and inquiry made, and then to be brought before him, or some other justice; when taken there, the people said, he was there about five o'clock, and that they lighted the first candle, to give him change by. After that Newland enquired about all he cou'd to hear where he was about six o'clock, but cou'd get no account of that. He was commited by justice Gallard, but own'd nothing.</p>
            <p>In his defence, he only asserted that he never saw the woman, before she came and search'd his house on that occasion, but brought no witnesses to his character, or to prove him to be elsewhere at six that evening.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding his weak and unsupported defence, after conviction he wept, and complained bitterly in the prison, that he was condemn'd innocent, that his witnesses happen'd to be absent at the hour of his trial, though they had waited all the day before at the court, and could wait no longer, being poor labourers, who could not live without their work. He now asserted that he was at home at the hour of six, eating his supper with his children; that a poor woman who took care of his children would swear it; that he had never been before a justice in his life before, and knew not how to make a defence. All this it must be owned, rais'd a compassion, (perhaps a mistaken one) in his favour; he was advis'd to get the affidavits of his witnesses, and lay them before proper authority. Two of these affidavits were made and sent; but they did not at all relate to the point in question, which could only serve his pupose; viz. to prove where he was at six in the evening, when the robbery was committed. That of his children's nurse and another woman, to this effect, he so often promised, never were procured. And farther, it should be remember'd that if any such affidavits in his defence, could have been made, they ought to have been made before either of the two justices, in his own neighbourhood, who examined him, and gave him a full and fair opportunity to make that, or any other defence that could be proved, by sending him with the headborough to every place where he affirmed he was; and among those places, it is remarkable he never mentioned that he was at home at the time of the robbery, either before a justice, or at his trial, nor till after his conviction; which seems to infer that this defence was then first devised, and fet up after his two other assertions had failed him.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175711230011"/>
            <p>It is acknowledged his denial of the fact, and persisting to assert his innocence, with a face of great simplicity, raised a doubtful compassion about he case, and then the favourable side of saving life (and only transporting him) seemed the more eligible. But this was not on a supposition of his innocence, but matter of mere favour. And if you suppose him guilty, which you must do, until the contrary be proved, it was certainly an aggravation of his crime, to persist in denying it to the last. It is certain the honourable and very merciful court, was not only strongly inclined, but endeavoured to save his life, even after conviction, if any thing clear, and satisfactory, could have been offer'd in his favour; but in above two months time after all possible enquiry, no such thing appear'd to their satisfaction.</p>
            <p>During his confinement in the cell, his companion and he endeavour'd to make a breach through the wall, but were discovered, and punished with a weeks close confinement; during which time, I visited him, and he denied having any hand even in this last fact, though his companion asserted most solemnly he was equally concerned with himself; such a habit had Bailey of denying facts.</p>
            <p>He could not be innocent of concealing this fact, and the strong presumption is, that he was active in it, though he denied it.</p>
            <p>Another account he gave me, lessen'd my opinion of his veracity and sincerity. viz: Of his being at church with his children, the afternoon of the Sunday,before he was apprehended. But his mother-in-law, whom I saw soon after, he dined with her that day at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-35">Winchmore-Hill</placeName>, and then they, with her husband, went to an alehouse. These falsehoods he was taxed with, and earnestly pressed to a sincere and open confession, but to no purpose; he answer'd, would you have me confess what I am not guilty of? 'Tis said the people of <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-36">Edmonton</placeName>, after many meetings and consultations about him. do generally believe him, guilty.</p>
            <p>He confess'd in general that he had been a sinner, but denied, or excused every particular laid to his charge, and not without some plausible appearance. So that his character on the whole, must be refer'd to the great tribunal.</p>
            <p>He was born at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-37">Ashwell</placeName> in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-38">Hertfordshire</placeName>; but has lived about <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-39">Edmonton</placeName> for twelve years past: he lived partly by <rs id="OA17571123-occupation-56" type="occupation">labouring work</rs>

            <p>It appear'd that they got gold coin through their hands, by paying in sums to the banker, and taking up bank notes for it, and then going to the bank of England, and there receiving cash for them. This was proved in several instances, and being observed by it's frequency was the occasion of dodgeing Wilcox to their house in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-47">Charles s-Square</placeName>, <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-48">Hoxton</placeName>, where they were apprehended by mr. Fretwell, a teller in the bank of England, and mr. Kemp porter of the mint, on warrants from mr. Fielding, assisted with his officers. Besides the house they lived in, they were informed by their maid servant, of a garden at the end of Haberdasher's almshouses whether they used to go, and in which were some secret places, which the carpenter told her no body could find out but himself, They were apprehended in one chamber to gether and some gold found in each of their pockets, five guineas and a half</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175711230013"/>
            <p>on Wilcox, which were returned her, and five guineas on Wood, of which two guineas were returned him; but two guineas and two half guineas, wanting one shilling and eight-pence, or one shilling and nine-pence each were detained, and produced in court, and appear'd fresh clip'd, or fil'd.</p>
            <p>In their chest of drawers were found two pair of shears, and a three-corner'd file, which were produced in court. And in other' drawers, two-three corner'd files, a pair of seales, some clipping and filings of gold, some shears and money, some weight and some light. The pieces being weighed, there were found eight guineas and two half guineas, wanting from 13 to 6 graines. Some clippings produced were supposed to be of guineas, and half guineas, which appeared from the diagonal slope and the comb turned circular, and being view'd through a glass, appear'd larger, and confirmed the belief, that they were of a guinea. Files with gold on them were found, and four light guineas, one fresh field. In the summer-house were found numberless incontestable proofs of the same practice, a fire-place with a closet for a work shop on each side for two; a fash-window done up so high, that no body could overlook them. Concealed drawers in which were more files and gold-meltings, a piece of an ingot and gold mixt with borax. Over a cockloft was found some gold, nine crucibles, a moveable-vice, weights, seales, chissel, gold silings, a piece of an ingot and two pair of shears.</p>
            <p>Wood had another lodging in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-49">Spital-fields</placeName>, in which were sound materials, and papers proving the same fact.</p>
            <p>It appear'd also, that White being Wood's agent, when he was a carpenter and builder, had raised sums for his exigencies of mr. Lambley to the value of about 400l. and not being able to repay it, had recourse to this criminal practice of filing ports (first) to pay their debts and recover themselves. This was begun and carried on about two years before the discovery.</p>
            <p>In Wood's letters to Dixon, which is another name for White, is this fatal prognostick of his sad destiny; about two years before it happen'd: "You will at last load me with ignominy and the gallows." He says, in one letter: "I have got about 4l. this week." And in another, "I have made this week 7l. 10s. and have receiv'd 150 guineas this week: So judge what you may do."</p>
            <p>It appears by their letters that this new trade (as they call'd it) was carried on at first by Wood in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-50">Birmingham</placeName>, and by White in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-51">London</placeName>, and they play'd into each other's hands.</p>
            <p>In one of Wood's letters to White, he sayes, " I have remitted to you to last Saturday 2179l. 1s. 0d. Gold Etc. 102l. 10s. 3d. This post 108l."</p>
            <p>In another, "I have made about 5l. 10s. 0d. day myself; so I hope I shall have a large cargo for you; be sure be industrious."</p>
            <p>In another, "Mine was ten ounces, one half; and your's but nine ounces three quarters; and I have been half my time on. I have sent 20 ounces and 11 penny weight, which at 3l. 14s. 0d. comes to 76l."</p>
            <p>Again, "It is strange to me, you have but 27l. in a month; as you said you had 12l. the first week."and again, "Desire them to give you guineas for it; perhaps you may make some advantage of the guineas, and then change some of them."</p>
            <p>In about six weeks time, viz. from the 28th of December, to the 12th of Feburary following, there were 3000l. circulated in this manner. From these and other like articles proved against him, under his own hand, an estimate may be made in gross of the great damage done to the publick, by the diminution of the current coin, in the compass of two years and upwards; not withstanding which, in his confession, and apology given under his own hand, (to be in serted in its proper place) he endeavours to deny and extenuate this charge.</p>

            <p>Wood offered himself to be a communicant before his trial, but as it cou'd not be expected that he would freely open himself concerning the crimes he was charged with, and being questioned, he desired to be excused, he was refused admittance, 'till after his trial and conviction, when he did not persist to deny his crime, and also made acknowledgement, and gave some satisfaction concerning another very bad affair laid to his charge concerning his deserting his wife and children, and living with this <persName id="OA17571123n75-1">

            <p>One day when strangers were pressing into the chapel, he sent me a message, that unless they were kept out he did not chuse to go to be made a gazing-stock to the idle curiosity of the spectators.For answer, he was told it was to no purpose to endeavour to avoid it; that I was sorry to find his thoughts taken up on such trifles, while he had the concerns of eternal salvation to attend to; that the ought to be more humbled, and submit to his circumstances, Etc. After this he attended duly, without farther objection.</p>
            <p>Here follows the confession which, for the quiet of his conscience, and the fain-faction of the public he was prevailed on to commit to paper.</p>
            <p>' I Do hereby confess myself Guilty of ' the fact for which my Life is ' Forfeited to the Laws of my Country, tho' not ' after that Extensive and aggravated ' manner, which was represented at my Trayal, ' and as Forfeited I am content to pay it: ' Which I hope will be thought by every ' part of the prejudic'd World a sufficient ' satisfaction for the Injustice I have done ' the publick.And I hope my ' melancholy and untimely Exit, will be a ' sufficient and fatal Warning; to prevent all ' others from Engaging in Schemes tho' ' ever so Interested, were the Laws of a ' Nation may subject them to such a ' Miserable and Ignominious period.</p>

            <p>On delivering me this confession in his own hand-writing, I had much discourse and some trouble to convince him that his crime was an offence against God and his laws, who being the guardian and protector of human society, forbids all injury a gainst our neighbours, this in particular being included in the eighth commandment; that it was also a treasonable of sence against the king, whose image and superscription his coin bears, and against his subjects, who are desrauded, and often put to great difficulties in commerce and dealing by light money, Etc. By such arguments he has prevailed on to erase and alter one expression, viz. 'That no single ' individual can complain of being ' injured; so partial and false a notion had he of the heinousness of his guilt.</p>
            <p>He declared farther, that as to the letter of his, read in court, which the evidence, Lambley, swore to be his hand, expressing to mr. Wight that he had got 7l. 10s. in one week, and had received 150 guineas, was misunderstood by the court as if he confessed the diminishing those guineas to get 7l. 10s. whereas he did not diminish those guineas, nor had he ever thought of diminishing any guineas at the time. That the injury done by him, in that way, was but trisling.</p>

            <p>As the fact was not denied by the prisoner, but only the intention; there is no occasion to sum up the proofs of it: But only observe that this matter was chosen to be prosecuted, rather then two other known charges against him, viz. that of being concerned in robbing the Liverpool bag, and that of forgery, or uttering bills knowing them to be forged; because the first was more open to a clear and full proof.</p>
            <p>As Wheeley was master of dissimulation, on my first applying to him, he quickly thought he had superseded my labours, by affecting greater degrees of sanctity than I could raise him to; he said, he had been a long time at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-53">Oxford</placeName> under the care of a learned, and very pious divine there, whom he named; and to gain credit to his affections, produced a zealous and affectionate letter written to him in his present situation, by that gentleman whom he called his uncle. He readily confered, at my request, to road to the more ignorant prisoners, and endeavour to prepare them for the holy communion, and for death</p>
            <p>But it was not long, before this disguise began to vanish; it was told me by one, who knew that he had been a <rs id="OA17571123-occupation-63" type="occupation">barber's servant</rs>

                     targets="OA17571123n86-1 OA17571123-occupation-63"/> there; that possibly he might have shaved that gentleman, and was shrewdly suspected to have robb'd his chambers, for which, another was blamed: But however, that he had robb'd his master, the barber, and so quitted <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-54">Oxford</placeName> But the prize was not of such value, as would bear the expence of pursuit and prosecution, and so he escaped.</p>
            <p>It was earnestly pressed to bring him to</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175711230016"/>
            <p>confession of the facts, espcially the first. To these charges, when tenderly opened to him, he answered with indignation, that he had never been a barber; but that it was his brother, who was dead, or transported: And indeavoured to fix the other robbery, on the person, whom it was charged on.</p>
            <p>But these denials were only to evade the odium of these charges and gratify that pride of heart, of which he had a deep tincture; for I learned from good authority that he was bred a <rs id="OA17571123-occupation-64" type="occupation">barber</rs>

            <p>His own account of his parentage and education had a different aspect; that his father was a considerable wooll-stapler in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-56">Warwickshire</placeName> atnear <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-57">Coventry</placeName>, that he was bred up in the choir at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-58">Litchfield</placeName>, was deem'd to have a fine treble voice while a boy, which was now mellow'd into a good tenor and basse: that he was a good proficient in music, and particularly on the harpsihord; and here it dropt casually from him, that he used sometimes to play the organ in a romish chappel belonging to one of the foreign embassadors, and well kenw the romish priest, who visited two of the convicts, Etc.</p>
            <p>He affected sometimes the air of a scholar, and sometimes a person who had kept the best of company, had hunted with the duke ofwho signed his petition for a reprieve.That he knew how things were carried at court, and was assured of the best introduction for his petition.</p>
            <p>Thus did he buoy himself up, and amuse his faithul monitors, with the false hopes of a reprieve, when he should have been heartily set on the great work of salvation, to which he was often and earnestly press'd.</p>
            <p>He seem'd to lament and apologize for one artful and wicked contrivance which he had consented to practice since his confinement; viz: to accuse an innocent man of credit, as a principal in selling the Liverpool bag, for which, he took a bribe of 50 guineas.As to this, he said, he was advised by a fellow prisoner, onea very great villain, to take the robbery of that bag on himself, and then impeach another, in order to be admitted an evidence against that person, and so save his own neck. Being again asked, at the place of execution whether that person were really concern'd, he answered, he was quite innocent, and that he had acquitted him before justice Fielding.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, as it has since come to me, he had shamefully confuted himself, before justice Fielding. For after that person was impeached, he was of course sent for, and brought to confront Wheeley, who being order'd to point him out as he sat in the room, where he was re-examined; instead of him he laid his hand on one of mr. Fielding's Useful people, to the astonishment of the spectators, and his own confusion. For as one observ'd, who was present; how many deaths did that man deserve, who could thus accuse, and involve in such terrors an innocent person? Wheeley pleaded for himself that he was ensnared into this mistake by an artifice, for that person was dress'd up, and seated like a justice of peace at mr. Fielding's right hand.</p>
            <p>The last, and most probable account that we could get from him, about the loss of the Liverpool bag, is contain'd in one of those letters, of which the extracts follow: and need not be here anticipated.</p>
            <p>Instead of depending on the account which he drew up of himself, consisting, as he said, of five sheets; which it may reasonably be presumed was calculated to raise pity and recommend his petition, a gentleman has permitted me to oblige the public with extracts of two of his letters, which will give a better idea of his characters, than could be had from his own mouth. They were written by him in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-59">Newgate</placeName>, when believed to be mad. Accept of them genuine as they flowed from his pen, with all their mistakes of spelling, and more important errors of judgment and morals.</p>

            <p>He had so well deceived this friend to whom he wrote; that he thus answers: " You cannot guess at my surprize on " receiving your letter, for I knew it was " yours, before I opened it, not having " the least suspicion of your being in your " senses.Since I received yours, I have " had one from London, which says, you " are in the same way now, so find you " are not discovered b the man as you " thought."</p>
            <p>Extract of another Letter to the same.</p>
            <p>Newgate, 27th Dec 1757.</p>

            <p>' His friend writes thus: 'If you thought proper, should be glad to know if you had any ' accomplice, for mr. Fielding and mr.

            <p>He told me and two others he was in London at that time.</p>
            <p>He told me, in presence of two others, he had discovered his real name to Dr.of Oxford.</p>
            <p>I you see by this second letter the unhappy criminal is surpriz'd to find himself deceived and deserted by a person whom he consided in! But how vain and idle is it for men to trust one another in matters and designs which destroy the very principles of mutual saith and trust, that is to say, you have destroyed the foundation and yet you expect the building will stand, and are disappointed and wretched to see it tumble down in ruins about your head. Again, you take a " Sollom Oath (as he words it) to assist each other as far as possible, to raise " two thousand pounds," doubtless by hook or crook, by what immediately follows, " and perchance either of us should be detected, the other should assist him. Etc." Now, what less is this, than to call the God of truth and justice to be witness and party to a false, unjust and wicked undertaking? and will not he punish such an insult as this? That the honour of his justice and truth is concerned to vindicate itself in such cases, a new proof appears, in the fall and exile of these two offenders.</p>
            <p>* This is of a piece with impeaching mr. Hanberry for selling or being concern'd in the Liverpool bag.</p>

            <p>About the year 1754, Wheeley came to live in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-65">London</placeName>, being recommended by his father as a <rs id="OA17571123-occupation-65" type="occupation">shopman</rs>

Sowbridge, and Barnston wooll-staplers in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-66">Milk-street</placeName>: next he lived with Wood and Middleton in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-67">Chandois-street</placeName>, and from thence went to mr. Neale; and during the time he liv'd with him, he made his addresses to a young lady of good character, who, not sufficiently appriz'd of his, gave him more encouragement than he deserv'd; so far, that he said, a day was set for the wedding; and a house agreed for at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-68">Birmingham</placeName>, where he was to set up business: There he met his accomplice some few days before he was apprehended, and from thence they went together to <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-69">Chester</placeName>; where a forged bill of ness. Bland and son for 300l. was past to mr. Marsden, who paid one or other of them 50l. in cash, and 25l. in bills to be paid by mess. Wimpey and co. in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-70">Newgate-street</placeName>, which on their very sudden return to <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-71">London</placeName> were presented, and press'd for ready payment; but put off for three days as usual, and for want of advicer; mean time the forgery came out, and Wheeley, who had presented them, was apprehended in a drapers shop near Covent-Garden; as he was buying clothes, for an uniform, to go a volunteer on board the Norfolk privateer.</p>
            <p>In that ship he had agreed for two shares, and paid 50l. earnest a day or two before, at which time being agitated, and much disturbed in mind, doubtless by the conscious guilty practices he was engaged in, and the dangers impending, he enquired very earnestly, if he might not have a commission on board the Norfolk, but being answer'd they were all fill'd he determined to go a volunteer, as mention'd, for which he was preparing when apprehended. At his lodging were found in his trunk, a number of letters taken out of the Liverpool bag, that had been lost, but never could be accounted for any other way, than that it was sold to his accomplice, whom he expressed by the seigned name of Fletcher; that a guinea was given as earnest, and four guineas when delivered between <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-72">Margate street</placeName> and <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-73">Redborne</placeName> near <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-74">St. Albans</placeName>, he call'd the postboy Jesscot.</p>
            <p>To this accomplice, he imputed his ruin. But the confederacy enter'd into, by that abominable oath mention'd in his letters, shews Wheeley as forward and ready for villainy as the other, he said that by means of a 20l. note of Bland's, for which Fletcher paid cash, they had got a plate graved like his, which they could fill up for any sum they thought proper. Being urged by all reasonable motives to make what discovery he could in this affair, for the satisfaction and security of those who had suffer'd, or might suffer; he answer'd, he had given all proper cautions to the bankers for that purpose, that his accomplice had been clark to a banker, and then a runner to the bank of England, that some little time before he was taken, up, his accomplice saw himself described in the public papers, and in hand bills for some of his male-practices, and this put him upon taking his flight to <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-75">Holland</placeName>; whence he said he receiv'd letters from him while in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-76">Newgate</placeName>, full of the horrors of guilt, It was this accomplice who, he said, received 38l. 5s. at mess. Gines in Lombard street on a bill taken out of the Liverpool bag about September last; that he own'd if he had been expeditious on that occasion, he might have made 2000l. but did not get quite 500l. by that bag. The letters, on the flight of his companion, fell into his hands, so that he was taken in his stead, and suffer'd for him. This is all the part he would confess to have had in the Liverpool bag, and this he persisted in, at his last moment, that he stood in Fletcher's shoes. Being frequently urged to discover the real name, he excused himself on account of his oath, but quickly betray'd himself, by saying he had told it to Dr.</p>

            <p>of <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-77">Oxford</placeName>, to which it was replied, then you have broke your oath.</p>
            <p>He was so throughly known, to be addicted to the vice of lying, in a very barefaced and impudent manner, and confirmed with oaths, that his late master discharged him for that practice, and express'd his opinion and fear that he would die with a lie in his mouth.</p>
            <p>He had told justice Fielding, that he found the Liverpool bag under his bed at the posthouse at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-78">St. Albans</placeName>, that he put the letters in his pocket intending to deliver them at the post-office, but on second thoughts hoped to make something of them.</p>
            <p>While he was in <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-79">New Prison</placeName>, a taylor, who had been with him there about two hours, was apprehended by order of justice Fielding; there was found on him a draught of Wheeley's on a gentleman at <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-80">Westminster</placeName> for 350l. this appeared to be intended as a bribe for his escape.</p>
            <p>A little before he was carried out to execution, he told the spectators he was innocent of all that he was charged with, and it was ail a Humbug. Being confronted with his own confession, he pested to say it was all a Humbug.</p>

            <p>Price was apprehended next morning on the <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-87">St. James's Guard</placeName>, and admitted an evidence by justice Wright, Allen was taken the same day at the Saves, and Davis next morning as he was passing along by the justice's door, Allen seeing him said, that is one man that was concern'd along with us. Ong was brought prisoner from Chelsea by another constable. After the robbery they had gone to Drury-lane, spent part of the money, and shared 16s. a piece.</p>
            <p>The three prisoners had good characters given them by several witnesses, at their trial. and nothing laid to their charge before this fact, except that Davis was a little suspected for keeping late hours.</p>

            <p>It was matter of real grief, to see three such stout young fellows cut down in the prime of life, by a drunken frolic, when off their guard, and incapable of keeping a watch on their designs, and actions.</p>
            <p>Learn from hence my dear fellow soliders, that watchfulness is the life of a soldier, in a spiritual and moral, as well as a military sense.</p>
            <p>They were now deeply sensible of their guilt, in the intended murder, as well as the robbery; and that the more severely they judged themselves, the more surely they should escape the judgment of God.</p>

She said she would not hold them, but that she believed a real presence in the holy sacrament, and that we hold it only as a memorial of the death of Christ; from which I took occasion to shew her mistake, and explain the true scriptural doctrine of our church in this article as taught in our Catechism and Communion service, equally distant from the two opposite extremes, viz. the errors of the Socinians and Romanists, and to shew the unreasonableness and absurdity of the doctrine of the church of Rome, on this head, as unscriptural and subversive of all evidence both from sense, reason and scripture. But as she did not often attend the chapel, nor give ear to these instructions, they were probably of little effect to her; for it might easily be perceived, that by the frequent admission and visits of certain persons, to her, she was more and more withdrawn from us, and averse to our instructions, being filled with bigotry and a bitter zeal, contrary to that moderation and charity which at first she promised and professed.</p>

Akerman before he was carried out to execution, and begged the caution should be given to courts and juries. He had often been told that great caution was used by them in taking evidence and detecting false witnesses, that the ought to have produced his witnesses in his defence, Etc. And being again pressed to a confession, if guilty; he answered do you think I could stand out in a lie after all the good words I have heard? He was resigned, and expressed a lively hope of his salvation.</p>
            <p>On the Morning of EXECUTION. March 31, 1758.</p>
            <p>GOING into the Press-yard it was told me that Wood was a dying, which was the more probable, as he was unable to get out of his cell or bed the day before, and had received the holy communion there with his wife, and one of the prisoners; at which time, being asked by me the cause of his illness, he imputed it to his consinement in the cell, and a charcoal fire, which he said he had kindled there to warm himself, which he perceived very suddenly to overcome him; and that he had not been able to stand since; this I mention because of the suspicion, and rumour that obtained this morning, in the jail and elsewhere, that he had taken some thing to finish himself. Be that as it may, he was in the agonies of death, speechless, and insensible, when I went up and pray'd for him: After which, on going up to the chapel, Wheeley was missing, and with all the search that could be made for half an hour, not to be found, nor his disappearing accounted for, to the astonishment of all that were concerned; at length, (O ridiculous instance of human weakness, and vanity!) this intriped hero who had boasted so much of his prepared temper and resignation, nay, his preference of death to life, in his present circumstances, was found quoiled up in the hollow top of the pulpit's founding board; being discovered to the great joy of the scarchers, down he came, double bolted as he went up, by the chequer'd bars dividing the chaple; and with proper reproofs and exhortations, was recover'd to a more resigned temper, so that we did not exclude him on his humble acknowledgement and submission, from joining in this last opportunity of receiving the blessed sacrament, as he had done the preceding day. The other five prisoners behaved themselves with</p>

            <p>composure, decency and devotion, to their last moments.</p>
            <p>The hurry and surprize, occasion'd by Wood's death (for he died about 8 o'clock) and Wheely's hiding himself, delay'd their setting out 'till half an hour past the appointed time, which was 9 o'clock, when they were carried out: Six in two carts, viz. <persName id="OA17571123n150-1">

            <p>At the place of execution, they were again ask'd singly, if they had any thing particular to say, or farther confession to make Bailey still asserted his entire innocence of the fact for which he died, as he had done ever since his sentence, he repeated his request, that jurries might be warned from him, to be very careful. what evidence they believed. for as he often said, " Other poor men may be in my case." After they had joined in prayers for near half an hour, and made a public confession of their faith, by repeating aloud the Apostles Creed; Wheeley made a speech to the multitude, expressing his concern, that those to whom he cheifly address'd himself, were too distant to hear him; he warned all young persons, to live in the fear of God, and within the bounds of his laws, to have a strict regard to his word, and then it was five thousand to one, if they came to this accursed death. that he had long indulged himself, and gone on in a course of successful pursuits, and O, shameful for him to utter! all his pursuits were just. As to the fact he died for, he said it was not committed with an intent to defraud his master, which he beg'd might be told him, but yet the rigour of the law had made it capital to him; however, he own'd he had lived without the fear of God ; and that he believed divine providence had used this as the last means to recal him after he had rejected all other calls of his word and his heralds, Etc. After thus speaking, he prayed very properly for some minutes for himself and his fellow sufferers with seeming devotion, yet his speech and prayer were accompanied with some theatrical gestures; and then he sung part of the 84th Psalm, ver. 1st to the 4th inclusive, in which at his request <persName id="OA17571123n151-1">

            <p>After this, poor Bailey, made his, last request, that as he was friendless the Ordinary would take care to have him buried, which by help of a small contribution made for that purpose by the humane and compassionate beholders, was carefully performed. During their last devotions the great multitude of Spectators in general behaved themselves with great decency and attention, indeed with devotion and humanity; and thus closed this aweful and striking scence of a real tragedy.</p>
            <p>This appeared very strange to some who knew him constantly to frequent <placeName id="OA17571123-geo-107">Covent-garden church</placeName> on Sundays; but it is hard to reconcile so mixt and variable a character to itself: take another instance of this; a little before he was carried out to execution he begged leave to go to his cell and put on a pair of clean stockings, the keeper going quickly after him. caughtld of his arm with a razor in his hand, just going to cut his throat; he asked him, What are you going to do? he said, Only to shave himself; but at that instant he fell on his knees and prayed.</p>
