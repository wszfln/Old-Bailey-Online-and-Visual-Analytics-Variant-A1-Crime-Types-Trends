            <p>They were Instructed in the Principles of Christianity, how that without Faith it is impossible to please God: For he that cometh to God, must believe that he is; and that he is a Rewarder of them who diligently seek him. Heb, xi. 6. From which and other Points of Scripture I shew'd them, that by the Laws and Dictates of Nature it was ingrafted in the Minds of all Men, that there is a God, or supream Being, who created and governs all Things; yet considering the laps'd State we are now plung'd into, in order to the perfecting our corrupt Nature, and preparing us for the enjoyment of God; it was necessary, that Revelation of the Divine Will should be added to the Light of Nature, which is now in a great Measure, if not totally, obscur'd by our Apostacy and Disobedience: This Defect is now made up to us sufficiently by the Gospel, wherein we are assur'd, that God so lov'd the World, that he gave his only beloved Son for us, that whosoever believth in him might not perish, but have everlasting Life; who hath brought Life and Immortality to Light thro' the Gospel. God having thus purchas'd for us a Right to eternal Life by the Death of his Son. I show'd 'em, that it was the Interest of all Men to endeavour, by the grace of God, to partake in the Benefits of Christ's purchas'd Redemption; and more especially of 'em who had forfeited their Lives to the Laws of the Country. Then I took occasion to exhort 'em in the most pressing Manner, to improve the short time allow'd them, in fearing, loving and serving God, and turning unto him with their whole Hearts, from whom they had so deeply revolted. I instructed them in the nature and design of the Christian Sacraments how we were early dedicated to God in our Baptism, and that we ought to Mourn for the many Breaches of our Baptismal Vows and Engagements; And that Christ having given us another Sacrament, as a Confirmation of our Baptismal Vows, as his last Legacy and Token of his Love, when he was leaving this World, it is our Duty to receive this Sacrament, for strengthening our Graces, confirming good Purposes in us, and disposing us for Eternity; That being Partakers of Christ's death, represented to us in this blessed Sacrament, we may likewise become Partakers of his Resurrection.</p>
            <p>When these, and such like Exhortations were given them, they behav'd themselves gravely, but for all the Prayers and Exhortations which could be possibly said, they were all very far from appearing to have any due Concern upon their Spirits, in Consideration of the most miserable Circumstances they were then in. <persName id="OA17270811n6-1">

Timms had been taught to read and write in his Youth, yet had so far forgot that he could now read but little. He said, that he had liv'd pretty regularly, till of late, when either Want or Despair seizing him, the Devil working upon his bad Inclinations induc'd him to take that desperate Resolution of robbing on the High-way. He confess'd that he had kept Company with lewd Women. And said that he never committed Theft or Robbery before, and that the Action for which he died, was the only capital Crime he ever was guilty of.</p>
            <p>He confess'd himself to be among the chief of Sinners, begging Pardon of God and all the World, which he hop'd to obtain, as believing the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and Christ the Son of God to be the only Saviour of Sinners, and however great his Sins had been, yet that he always knew, and wanted not Inclinations to do that which is good, which he pleaded not as a Merit, but only relied and cast himself upon the Mercy of God, Merits of Jesus Christ, who died for our Sins, and rose again for our Justification, and who now sits at the Right-hand of God, pleading and interceeding for the Pardon of the Sins of poor Mortals. He always appear'd very Devout and Attentive at Prayers and Exhortations,</p>

He own'd, (although at first all the Three denied it) that they had made an Appointment to go out in Company and rob upon the High-way, and that Timms was the first Proposer of it, tho' indeed he and Brown were too ready to comply with the Proposal. He said, that in the preceding course of his Life, he had behav'd himself with indifferent Circumspection, till about a Year ago, he gave himself to a more loose and irregular Life than formerly, never going to Church, as he had been formerly used to do.

Notwithstanding Mr. Sells swore that, while the other two robb'd him, he, viz. Perry, held a Truncheon over his Head, threatning to knock him down in case of the least Opposition; yet he said, that he did nothing but stood at a considerable distance 8 or 9 yards off; and Sells asking if he knew him? he answer'd, he did, for he had frequently drunk at his House, for it is a Publick one at Windsor, and he added, of a very indifferent Character. He confest that he had not liv'd conformable to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, having been too much guilty of accompanying lewd Women, altho' he had a Wife and several Children of his own; of drinking to Excess; Swearing and keeping idle Company. Although he was Illeterate, yet he had more Knowledge of Religion than a great many of these unfortunate Wretches. He declar'd himself very Penitent for all his Sins; having been always very grave and attentive at Prayers and Exhortations, that he believ'd to be saved through the Merits of Jesus Christ, who suffer'd and died for his Sins; that he was in Peace with all Mankind, forgiving all Men the Injuries done him, as he expected forgiveness at the Hands of God; and died in appearance of having a firm Hope of obtaining Mercy from God, and eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

He was afflicted with Sickness most part of the time he was in the Hold, which render'd him the more incapable of performing his Duty, as he ought and desir'd to do. He seem'd to be a young Man naturally of a good and easy Temper, and own'd that he stopt and held Mr. Sells's Horse, till Timms robbed him, and oblig'd Sells to give him more Money, than at first he had given to Timms, till Mr. Sells begg'd they would let him go, having no more left him but Eighteen-pence. All the Three constantly affirm'd that they got only Seventeen Shillings; which was 5 s. 8 d. to each of 'em, for which they died, never having robb'd or stollen more in their Life, as they said, and</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA172708110004"/>
            <p>went to Death with it. I told 'em that it was not the greatness or smallness of the Sum, but the breach of the express Law of the Land, whereby they were forbid to attack, threaten or rob any Person upon pain of Death, on the Highway, which took away their Lives; and as to the small Sum they robb'd the Man off, if it had been 100 l. instead of 17 s. they would have taken it. The Truth of all which they acknowledg'd, and in consequence the Justice of their Sentence according to Law. I took occasion to represent to Brown, how ungrateful he had been to God and Man for the good Education he had got, in being guilty of so great Wickedness. He acknowledg'd, that he had had the Advantage of a good Education, but had been more heedless than he ought; and that in several Instances he had been disobedient to his Parents. I exhorted him to repent of all Sins in particular, and especially that of the capital Sin he had committed, and which had brought him to so much Shame and Sorrow, for which he justly forfeited his Life to the Laws of the Kingdom, and brought this Disgrace, not only upon himself, but upon his Family and Kindred who were to survive him. He confess'd himself to have been among the chief of Sinners, begging Pardon of God and Man for his manifold Offences, expressing a strong Confidence in the Mercy of God, thro' Jesus Christ our Lord, in whom he believed as his only Saviour, confessing the Justice of his Sentence, and that the Punishment of his Iniquity was infinitely less than what he had deserved, forgiving all Men the Injuries done him, as he expected forgiveness from a gracious and merciful God, and dying in Peace with all the World.</p>
            <p>All the Prisoners who were under Sentence, were confident that they should get a gracious Reprieve from his Majesty, which I believe made them something more careless in their Duty, than otherwise they would have been. These three unfortunate Men having entertain'd the same Apprehensions: When the Account came of their being order'd for Execution, they were struck with Surprize; yet were of such Courage and Resolution, that one could scarce discern any visible change upon them; only that they were more sollicitous in their Preparation for Eternity, and indeed all of 'em went to suffer (as they said in firm Hopes of eternal Life, through the Mercy of God, in Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
            <p>At the Place of Execution,</p>
            <p>THey all behav'd very gravely and devoutly, complying with the Prayers, and making what Responses they could. They desir'd, after the 23d Psalm of David was sung, to sing the Lamentation of a Sinner, which being comply'd with, they said, that they had made full Confessions before, and had no more to add, only, Brown said, that what farther Confessions he had, he would make the same to God.</p>
