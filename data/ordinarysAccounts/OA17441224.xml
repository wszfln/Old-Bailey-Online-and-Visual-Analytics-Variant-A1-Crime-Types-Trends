            <p>WHILE under Sentence, they had constant and suitable Exhortations given them in respect to their several unhappy Cases, and in the stated Course of my Ministrations, were earnestly invited to accept of the purchased Salvation of the Son of God, from an Improvement of those Words of the Prophet, Ho! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money, come ye buy and eat, yea, come buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price. Isaiah lv. I. From hence, occasion was taken to set forth the Fulness and Freeness of that Salvation we have by Christ, and Encouragement given to all of applying to Christ for the Waters of Eternal Life. They seemed in some Measure affected, whilst I thus opened and illustrated this Passage of Scripture, and I hope were enabled to make a particular Application of it to themselves.</p>

While his pretended Wife was under Sentence, in the the Time of Prayers and Sermon she commonly went to Wells, within the Chequer-Work by the Pulpit, and Wells said to her, That he wish'd her a good Journey, for he should not be long before he followed her. This was on the very Morning of her Execution. In their Discourse together they were sometimes very noisy, for which I was obliged often to reprove them, and then they were silent.</p>
            <p>Wells had been a very wicked, profligate Youth; much addicted to vile Women, and Drinking, Swearing, Gaming, and every other destructive Vice. He seemed to be a young Fellow of tollerable Parts, and might have been capable of good Business, but was wholly void of the Grace and Fear of God, and this hastened him to the fatal Tree, the common and deserved End of such abandoned Wretches.</p>

He seemed to be a vile, harden'd Wretch, refusing to make Confession, and leaving me in a hurry, seeming to despise the Fear of God, and bore no regard to Men; yet he came to own the Burglary and Thefts for which he suffered, and before he died profess'd penitence, which in Charity we may judge he had.</p>

            <p>HE was a very vicious young Man, much addicted to Drinking, and other Debaucheries, negligent of all Religion, so that he never of late went to Church, and had almost quite forgot what little good Education his Parents had bestowed upon him.

He was also one of the Black-Boy-Alley Crew, and therefore no Objection can be made against the Justice of his Sentence. He was very attentive to the Word of God and Prayers, and it is to be hoped died penitent of all his Sins.</p>

I inform'd him, that the great God created him, and all the World. A second Question was, Who redeem'd him? he hesitated a while, and at last he said, The D - l; astonish'd and grieved at such an improper and wicked Answer, I sharply reprimanded him, but I fear to little Purpose, for he was the most obstinate inconsiderate little Villain that I ever saw, since I have had the Honour to serve the City.

He was of no Trade, and being a wicked young Fellow, us'd to loiter about the Streets, stealing and carrying off whatever he could lay Hands on. He pretended that he was at first put in Bridewell for some Crime of which he was acquitted by the Justices at Hicks's-Hall, and thereupon discharged out of Bridewell; but as he was coming out of the Door, some Persons who knew him accused him of a Street-Robbery, on which he was committed to Newgate, and afterwards tried and convicted upon it. There was another concerned with him in this Fact, but he made his Escape and was heard of no more. Hill would not own the Robbery as sworn against him, which is very common with these unhappy People. He was a wicked debauched young Fellow, and link'd to an infamous Gang of Thieves and Pick-pockets. He was at first somewhat obstinate and rude in his Behaviour, but upon being sharply reprov'd, he behaved better. He professed his Penitence, and died in the Faith of Christ.</p>

            <p>HE was concerned in most of those Outrages that have been lately committed in this great Metropolis, and was convicted upon the Evidence of Harper, being one of the Black-Boy-Alley Crew. Harper gave an exact Account of the several Robberies, and what Share of the Plunder was allotted to Roberts, so that there was no Objection but the Infamy of the Evidence; and if such Evidence was not allowed, such Offenders would seldom or never be convicted, since in many Cases there are none acquainted with their Ways but themselves.</p>
            <p>HE confessed himself a very vile Sinner, and that he deservedly suffered. He behaved well in Chapel, and died penitently, and in Charity with the World.</p>

            <p>THE Account we are now about to give respects a Sett of Malefactors, who not content with the Crime of Robbery, have thought  add thereto the most heinous Offence of Sodomy, which brought down Fire from Heaven; and, as if this had not been enough, they made that very monstrous Crime a Handle and Snare to draw Gentlemen in, who were inclined to that unnatural Sin. Every one will acknowledge this was no more than they deserved, and indeed, had it been yet more severe, provided it had made them take Warning, no Mortal living would have pitied them, but on the contrary, would have  thereat; but, as there are little Hopes, they who have gone so far, will stop there, we must wish, for our common Safety, and  avert the visible impending Judgments of Heaven, that every one of them, of what Rank  were brought to condign Punishment: in the mean while, all we can do, is to expose  villainous Practices, that in case the  of God does not deter them for the  the fear of the Gallows, at least may, and bring them to Repentance.</p>
            <p>OF this abominable Sett, the better Sort, (if indeed any better can be of such a Crew) have found the way to escape both Shame and Chasment, very probably, by commuting with their Purses for the safety of their Persons; and as for the latter, who were all Soldiers, they escaped what was due to their Deserts, by being concerned with their Superiors; so true  this our righteous Age, that Wickedness in high Places is sure to go unpunished. Not to enlarge any farther upon this Head, we shall proceed to lay open to the World, this black Scene of Iniquity, not knowing which most to be astonished at, the Wickedness and Infatuation of the Gentlemen so drawn in, on one side, or the consummate Impudence and Villainy of those Decoy Ducks the Soldiers on the other. Proceed we then, to give the best Account we have been able to obtain, of the several Enormities whereof they have been guilty, and of which they must have received their due Reward, had they not been so effectually skreen'd by their Accomplices of the better Sort. But, though they have hitherto escaped corporal Punishment, at least, in this World, we will do out Endeavour they shall not go wholly Scot-free, but expose both them and their vile Practices to the Public, to deter all others, who are not so thoroughly case-harden'd, from pursuing the like Courses. And this, we hope, will be admitted as a sufficient Reason for giving the following Account of them, though they had Interest enough with those in Power to obtain a Reprieve, which may possibly be followed by a Pardon.</p>
            <p>IT is a certain Truth, the longer we go on in evil Ways, the worse we grow; and that, if we begin pilfering with a Penny, we shall undoubtedly end with Pounds, unless the Hempen Neckcloth prevents us; and this is very apparent from the Confession of one of these abandoned Wretches, who gave the following Account of himself, namely, That the first Fact he committed was on the 7th of June, 1743, together with D - l D - , belonging to the same Company. One of them it seems being a Taylor by Trade, was employed to make Waistcoats for the rest, and having just finished one Parcel, got <persName id="OA17441224n84-1">

Being come thither, poor Meakins, little suspecting any Danger, and being in Liquor, and tired into the Bargain, flung</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174412240012"/>
            <p>them down, and laid himself upon them to take a Nap. As he thus lay, buried in Sleep, his Companion observing the String of his Watch hang out, cry'd to D - l D - , It is a fine Opportunity, shall we take his Watch? No, answered D - , he will know he lost it here, and then we shall come into Trouble. D - n him, said the other, he is dead drunk, and will not know any Thing of the Matter. Upon which he called out to Meakins, in a loud Voice, What are you asleep? and receiving no Answer, he took hold of the String, and drew the Watch out of his Pocket, which he afterwards pawned for 20 s. ten whereof he kept himself, and gave the Remainder to D - D - .</p>
            <p>WHETHER his Success on this Occasion was an Inducement to him to continue the Practice, we cannot say, but we find him afterwards going on in the same wicked Course, without any Scruple or Remorse, and this with the heinous Aggravation of making the detestable Sin of Sodomy a Handle for the Accomplishment of his profligate Designs. Accordingly the next Robbery wherein he appears to have been concerned, was in Company with <persName id="OA17441224n86-1">

                  <interp inst="OA17441224n86-1" type="given" value="JAMES"/>James Ruggles</persName>, J &#8211; S - , and T &#8211; C - , at the Beginning of last April, about the Hour of Ten at Night.</p>
            <p>THESE four Brethren in Iniquity, as well as Brothers in Calling, (being all Soldiers) were then sauntring about the Park, in quest of somebody fit for their abandon'd Purpose, when C - fixed his Eye upon a Gentleman whom he judg'd, and, as it prov'd, rightly, to be inclined to that horrid and unnatural Vice. Upon this, he went up to him, and accosted him in a Dialect, it is to be supposed, peculiar to that Sett of Monsters, which, it seems was so agreeable to the Gentleman, that not considering the Hazard he ran in this World, by putting his Life in the Power of such a Miscreant, nor yet the Enormity of the Crime he was about to perpetrate, he soon agreed to withdraw with him to the Side of Buckingham Wall, in the Green Park, as a Place proper for their abominable Practices, little suspecting the Snare that was laid for him.</p>
            <p>IN effect, not long after the Gentleman and his new Acquaintance had arrived at the Spot designed for the perpetration of their Villainy, Ruggles and S - , with the third Soldier, who had observed all their Motions, and followed them at a Distance, made up to them, just as they seem'd to be so busily engaged, that there was no Room to deny their Wickedness, and sternly demanded, What they were about, and what Business they had there. The Gentleman, who it may easily be imagined, was greatly confounded at the Danger wherein he had involv'd himself, by being surpriz'd in such a Fact, could think of no better Excuse, than that the young Man, meaning C - , had brought him thither; as if that would have been in his Power, had not he been himself so detestably inclined: Be that as it will, C - , who acted his Part to the Life, retorted the Charge upon the Gentleman, and accused him of seducing him thither, adding, he believed it was with Intent to him. Hereupon, the three Soldiers began to abuse the Gentleman excessively, d - ing him, and calling him a hundred Mollying Rascals, and swearing he ought to have his Brains dashed out, with abundance of more scurrilous Language to the same Purpose, which they likewise accompanied with great Rudeness and ill Usage.</p>
            <p>THE Gentleman finding he was got into bad Hands, desired them to be civil, and not treat him ill, and he would give them all the Money he had about him, as he accordingly did, but it amounted only to Five-pence Half-penny. It will easily be believed, so small a Sum was far from satisfying these abandoned Villains, whose sole Design was to make a Property of him. They told him therefore, he should not come off so, for unless he produced more, they would carry him directly to the Guard-room, and give an Account of his vile Actions; accordingly, they proceeded</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174412240013"/>
            <p>forthwith to search him, without any farther Ceremony, but found he had indeed produced his all, for he had no more. On searching him, however, narrowly, they found a Gold Repeating Watch, upon which they laid Hands, D - ning his Blood, and telling him, they supposed he designed to have kept that from them, but they should make Bold with it; ading, he might be glad he escaped so easily, for he deserved to have his Brains dash'd out against the Wall. In Effect, the Gentleman finding all Resistance would be in vain, was forced to submit with a little struggling, and suffer them to go off with their Prey, which they did accordingly.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' they had easily got such a Booty, they were not much the better for it, for sometime not knowing what to do therewith, and not daring to offer it to pawn or Sale, for fear of being stopt, wherefore it was agreed, that one of them should keep it in his Custody, till it could be some Way disposed of. He rejoyced therefore greatly, when some Days after, he found it was advertised, with a Reward of Twenty Guineas, and no Questions to be asked, upon carrying it to a Watch-Maker's in Fleet-street. Accordingly, not knowing better what to do with it, he sent his Wife therewith, whilst he staid himself behind at a little Distance.</p>
            <p>IT seems in struggling to get the Watch from the Gentleman, one of the Seals was broken off, which the Soldier before-mentioned intended to have kept to himself, imagining the Reward would have been paid without it; but when the Woman carried the Watch to Mr. * * *, he told her, he knew that to be the Watch, and could swear to it, for he had made it, and he set it a Repeating immediately; but he added, there was a Seal wanting, for which the Gentleman had a great Value, and he durst not pay the whole Reward unless that was produced likewise, but would give her Ten Guineas, if that would satisfy her. The Woman answered, there was all she found with the Watch, and she expected the full Reward; adding, that her Husband was near at Hand, and she would fetch him, and if he was willing to take that, she should not object against it.</p>
            <p>HEREUPON she stept to him, and acquainted him with what the Gentleman said, wherefore he went himself, desiring to know why he would not pay the Reward, since it was the same Watch that had been advertised, and there was every Thing that was found with it. Mr. * * * answered, he did not refuse paying the whole Reward, provided the other Seal was brought, but durst not do it otherwise, till he had seen the Owner, who valued that particular Seal very much, and whom he expected to see next Day; that he would then acquaint him with this Circumstance, and if he agreed to it, he would pay the Remainder, and in the mean while he would given him ten Guineas directly.</p>
            <p>THE Soldier expostulated with the Gentleman sometime longer, telling him, he insisted upon the whole, or the Watch again; but finding he would not part with any more, till he had seen the Proprietor of the Watch, at last he pulled the other Seal out of his Pocket, and asked if that was it; being answered it was, he said he hoped then he should have the full Reward, to which Mr. * * * * * immediately agreed without farther Words, offering him a Bank Note for that Sum, which he declined taking, and desired to have it in Gold, which was comply'd with directly.</p>
            <p>AFTER receiving the Money, he expressed a great Desire to see the Gentleman himself, even tho' he were to have had no Reward, and gave Mr. * * * * * * * three small Keys, which he said belonged to the same Person, and begging he would acquaint him with his wanting to speak with him, (which was promised) and he would call again to know his Answer: But he said this only for a Blind, that so Mr. * * * * * * * might not suspect the villainous Method by which he had acquired it, for he never intended to trouble him any more.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174412240014"/>
            <p>AS soon as he had got Possession of his Booty, and was arrived at home, he consulted with his Wife, whether he had not better sink some of it upon his Companions, since they could neither Write nor Read, and might, therefore, very probably, never know what he received. The Result of this Consultation was, that he should keep eight Guineas to himself, and share only the remaining twelve with his Comrades; accordingly he carried it to <persName id="OA17441224n96-1">

                  <interp inst="OA17441224n96-1" type="given" value="JAMES"/>James Ruggles</persName> and John S - , telling them the Watch had been advertised, and he had received that Sum for it: Whereupon they honestly agreed between them, as C - was then in the Savoy, to share 3 Guineas and a half a Man, give half a Guinea to the Soldier's Wife, and the remaining Guinea to C - , with which, however, he was very well contented, as he was then just going Abroad.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Night Thomas C - being alone in the Park, and having singled out a Person whom he thought fit for his Purpose, according to his wonted Custom in the Evening, accosted him in the usual Dialect, and soon struck up a Bargain with him, to which he was but too readily inclin'd. They agreed then to withdraw to a Place convenient for their wicked Purpose, which was in the Middle-Park, where being arrived, and C - observing a proper Opportunity, snatched his Silver Watch out of his Pocket, and scowr'd off therewith immediately; the Gentleman calling after him to stop, but in vain. With this Booty he came directly to the House of his old Comrade, the Taylor before-mentioned, who made the Company Waistcoats, and desired him to pawn it.</p>
            <p>THE other answered, it was a large old-fashioned Watch, and would not fetch much. Upon which C - said, D - n it, what can I do with it, I don't know; nor I neither, reply'd the other. At last C - cried, you may as well buy it, you can tell better how to dispose of it than I. Whereupon the Taylor asked, what he would have for it? C - answered, a Guinea. His Comrade answered, with a Smile, that is more than I can pledge it for to any one: Besides, suppose I could pawn it for so much, what should I get by that? He told him, however, if he approved of it, he would give him 15 s. for it, at a venture. To which C - agreeing, he paid the Money, and keeping it afterwards for some time till he could meet with a Purchaser to his Mind, sold it for 2 l. 2 s. 6 d.</p>
            <p>AFTER this hopeful Prank, T &#8211; C - and <persName id="OA17441224n99-1">

                  <interp inst="OA17441224n99-1" type="given" value="JAMES"/>James Ruggles</persName>, being out together in the Park, (the usual Place of Rendezvous, it seems, for such Gentry) and looking out sharp for their Prey, C - , who was generally the Decoy-Duck on these Occasions, having fixed upon a Gentleman for his Purpose, went up to him, and accosted him in the usual Terms. His Company, as it appeared, was not disagreeable to his new Acquaintance; for they soon agreed to take a Walk together to the Back-Side of the Library in the Middle-Park, where they immediately proceeded to the detestable Business for which they had retir'd thither.</p>
            <p>IN the mean while <persName id="OA17441224n100-1">
                  <interp inst="OA17441224n100-1" type="gender" value="male"/>

Give me what you have this Minute, or I will carry your directly to the Guard-Room. The Gentleman, confounded and frightened almost out of his Wits, made answer, he did not come along with the young Man for any Harm, and desired Ruggles not to use him ill; but C - soon silenced him, by crying out, indeed he seduced me hither to Molly me. Hereupon Ruggles immediately said, D - n you, you Dog, let me have what you have got this Instant; and running his Hand directly into his Fob and Pockets, took out his Watch therewith and made off.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174412240015"/>
            <p>HAVING thus possessed themselves of these unrighteous Gains, they next consulted how to dispose of the Watch, and C - offer'd Ruggles to let him have it for 16 s. Ruggles agreeing to give him 15 s. 6 d. the Bargain was soon struck, though when he had got Possession of it, he was forced to keep it for sometime not knowing well what to do with it. At last, bethinking himself that his Fellow-Soldier and old Comrade, R &#8211; B - the Taylor, used sometimes to buy such Things, he carried it to him, and asked if he would purchase it; he consented thereto readily, provided they could agree, and asked what he demanded for it? He answered, Two Guineas and a Half. Two Guineas and a Half! crys the Taylor, that is more than I could fell it for, if it was my own, and I would not give above half the Money; whereupon Ruggles asked what was the most he would offer, and B - answered a Guinea and a Half; he replied, he would keep it for ever first; upon which they parted for that Time.</p>
            <p>A little while after, however, he came again to B - , and repeated the Question, what was the most he would give for the Watch? To which the other answered, he could not afford to bid much more, if he proposed to get any Thing by it; Ruggles replied, he would not take that, but if he would give Two Guineas, it should be a Bargain. B - then bid a Crown more, but Ruggles would not take it, upon which he advanced to Two Pounds, which Sum the other likewise refused; at last he told him, unless he would give him Six-pence out of the two Guineas, he would have nothing to do with it. To this Ruggles readily agreed, and the Money was paid down; whereupon B - kept the Watch about two Months, and then disposed of it to one Serjeant F - , of the First Regiment of Foot-Guards, for Four Pounds.</p>
            <p>NOT long after this, Tom C - , <persName id="OA17441224n103-1">

                  <interp inst="OA17441224n103-1" type="given" value="JAMES"/>James Ruggles</persName>, John S - , and R &#8211; B - , being altogether at their accustomed Rendezvous, the Park, and about the usual Hour, namely, between nine and ten at Night, C - having fixed his Eyes upon one S - n, a Glover, as they found afterwards, addressed him in his wonted Manner, and having soon struck up a Bargain, decoyed him to the Back Side of Buckingham Wall, near the Ice-House, whither his villainous Companions followed them at a Distance.</p>
            <p>THEY had not been long there, before they began to be very busy together; upon which the others immediately ran up to them, and seizing the Glover by the Collar, demanded what they were about, swearing bitterly at the same Time, unless he would give 'em all he had about him, they would carry him directly to the Guard-Room. He was not, however, so easily frightened out of his Money as their former Bubbles, for he refused to comply with their Demands, and told them, he would sooner choose to go to the Guard, for he had done no Harm, having only come thither innocently with that young Man, meaning C - . When they found him so willing to go to the Guard, they refused to give him that Liberty, and insisted upon taking what he had about him; accordingly, running their Hands into his Pockets, they pulled out a Purse, wherein C - pretended there was but 14 s. though they afterwards heard there was more, but they could never find how much; and this done, they went to B - 's House, where they divided the Spoil.</p>
            <p>SOME Time after this, S - , Ruggles, and B - , happened to meet the same Person in their usual Walks in the Park, and S - accosted him in the ordinary Dialect of those Gentry. One would have thought the ill Treatment he had met with not long before, should have made him take Warning, and be very cautious what new Acquaintance he engaged with; but so strongly was he addicted to this abominable and unnatural Vice,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174412240016"/>
            <p>that, not knowing S - was one of those who had robbed him before, he readily agreed to go along with him to the same Place, where he had been with C - . We believe, therefore, but few will pity him, when they see him fall, a second Time, into the same Snare, as he accordingly did in a few Minutes: For James Ruggles and R &#8211; B - , who were upon the Watch, and had followed them at a Distance, as usual, no sooner perceived them very busy together, than they rushed upon them, (S - , who saw them coming, seizing at the same Time on the Glover with one Hand) and asked them, with two or three D - ns, Whether they were Mollying of each other.</p>
            <p>HEREUPON S - , who knew his Cue, and had his Lesson very perfect, cry'd out, Pray, Gentlemen, be civil; I confess, he wanted indeed to ruin me, but I would not comply with his wicked Desires, and therefore I caught him fast by the Arm, and held him so, that he could not escape. Aye, aye, hold the Dog, said his hopeful Associates, and bring him to the Guard-Room, unless he will give you all he has about him. Whether in so doing, S - might have hurt him terribly or not, which is far from unlikely, we can't say, but he called out, Murder! Murder! as loud as he could several times, though to little Purpose, nobody coming to his Rescue. The lawless Villains not regarding his Outcries, or troubling themselves whether they hurt him or not, told him, D - n you, you Dog, we don't value your bawling out, had you twenty of your Mollying Rascals about you, they should not save you; which said, they immediately proceeded to lay him under Contribution, running their Hands into his Breeches, and taking all the Money he had.</p>
            <p>NEITHER did this satisfy them, for they examined likewise the Contents of his Coat and Waistcoat, wherein, however, they met with no great Booty, finding only a Pocket-Book, in which were divers Notes and Bills, giving an Account of his Name, Habitation, and Business, which was of no manner of Service to them. Not knowing, therefore, what to do with it, R &#8211; B - , after keeping it some Time, sent his Wife therewith to the Glover's House, believing it might be of Use to him, and, perhaps, expecting some small Reward for restoring it: But the Man happening not to be at home, she brought it back again, though the Servant who answered her, and had asked her Business, which she told him, desired her to leave it; so he received no Benefit from B - 's good Intentions, which was the more the Pity, because, we are afraid, he was not often troubled with them; for, telling his Wife, he would run no further Hazards about it, he immediately threw the Notes into the Fire, and kept the Book for his own Use.</p>
            <p>SOME Time after this Exploit, B - and C - being at their wonted Rendezvous, the Park, about ten at Night, and, as was before observed, like their old Master the D - l, seeking whom they might devour, the latter accosted a Gentleman, whom he judged fit for his Purpose, (wherein, as has been seen, by whatever Marks he knew them, he was never deceived) and after some other customary Discourse upon that Head, asked whether they should take a Walk together; the usual Phrase, it seems, among such Gentry, for entering into close Conversation. The Gentleman, who undoubtedly had received Intimation of the many Robberies committed by this audacious and abandoned Gang, in that Neighbourhood, asked, whither they should go? and upon C - 's answering, the best Place he knew for their Purpose, was the back Side of Buckingham Wall, in the Green Park. He answered, No, I will not go thither, for there are always a Knot of Villains upon the Watch, to make a Property of such as we.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174412240017"/>
            <p>HEREUPON C - h (being resolved his Prey should not escape him, if he could possibly prevent it) said, Whither will you go, do you think we can be safer any where else? The Gentleman answer'd, Yes, come along with me. This said, they went out at the Stable-yard, till they arrived at a long unfrequented Passage that leads into St. James's-street, whither B - n followed them as usual. They stopt just under an Arch-Way in this Passage, and being willing to loose no Time, were very busily engaged before B - n could get up to them: C - h, who was upon the Watch expecting him, no sooner saw him approach, than he seized his new Acquaintance fast by the Collar, and there held him. B - n then came up, and said with a stern Voice, D - n you, you Dogs, have I caught you at last? Give me what you have directly, or I will take you to the Watch. The Gentleman being unwilling to go to the Watch, and equally unwilling to part with his Money, struggled hard to prevent B - n putting his Hands into his Pockets: In doing which, he was over-power'd, and they took from him about 5 l.</p>
            <p>NOT long after this Complication of Villainy, C - h went by himself into the Park to look for Prey, and fixing his Eye upon a Gentleman whom he judg'd suitable for his Purpose, and whom he believes to have been a Foreigner, accosted him in the ordinary Dialect, and soon prevailed on him to withdraw into the Middle Park. Being arrived at one of the most private Places, the Gentleman offered to proceed to such a Sort of Conversation as had induced him to retire thither; but C - h, who had other Designs in his Head, not only refused to comply, but violently seized hold of him, and with a stern Voice said, D - n your Blood, you Dog, now I have you, and unless you immediately deliver your Watch, and what Money you have about you, I will drag you to the Guard-Room directly.</p>
            <p>THE other refused complying with this Demand, but to little Purpose; for C - having him at a great Disadvantage, held him fast with one Hand, whilst he searched all his Pockets with the other, and took out from thence 18 s. in Money, a silver Watch, and a Snuff-box of the same; this done, he left the poor Foreigner to bemoan his ragged Fortune, and went directly with the Spoil to R - d B - , whom he acquainted with the way he got it, and consulted how he should dispose thereof. B - answered, it was nothing to him, they were his, and he might do as he pleased with them. C - reply'd, he knew not how to dispose of them, wherefore if he (B - n) had a mind for them, he would sell them to him, for he believed he knew best what to do with them. He then ask'd him what he demanded for them; if you like the Snuff-box says the other, at 10 s. it is yours; he offer'd 9 s. and the other taking him at his word deliver'd the Box, which he fold after keeping it sometime to a Silver-smith in the Strand for 14 s.</p>
            <p>THE very Night that C - committed the Robbery beforementioned, one Corporal S - , who belonged to the same Company, but was upon Windsor Party, came to Town on purpose to send some Money down to his Wife by another Corporal, who was going to St. Edmund's-Bury, where she lives: Just after he was gone from B - 's, in comes C - h, with his Booty, and being told, that Corporal S - had been there, ask'd where he was gone, and was answer'd, they did not know, but expected him to return soon, as accordingly he did. C - express'd himself that he was glad to see him, and ask'd, if he would go and take part of a Pot, to which he readily agreed. In their way to the Alehouse, they pass'd by an Oyster-stall, whereupon, C - ask'd S - , If he would have any Oysters? The latter agreeing to this also, he treated him with Four-penny worth; and while they were eating them, the Foreigner, whom C - had</p>

            <p>robb'd, came by and saw him; but not thinking it safe to apprehend him without Help, went on to a Watchman, and desired his Assistance to take him. Accordingly the Watchman came with him; but when they came to the Oyster-stall, he was just gone; upon which, the Gentleman ask'd which Way he went, and they answer'd towards Hyde-Park-Corner.</p>
            <p>THEY made haste therefore after him, and had not gone many Doors further, before the Gentleman saw C - h in a Publick House, drinking with his Companion; and as he could discern every Thing that passed, by the Light of the Candles thro' the Window, he observ'd him winding up the very Watch, and pulling out the very Box he had taken from him. Hereupon he told the Watchman they were the same Things he had been robbed of, and desired he would go in and apprehend him; but the Fellow answered, There were two of them, wherefore he durst not venture in alone. Upon which they went to get another to assist them, and when they returned back, the Birds were flown.</p>
            <p>THAT same Night, after this Disappointment, the poor Foreigner going along Piccadilly, saw another Soldier, whom he mistook for the Person that had robbed him, and accordingly charged him with the Fact; upon which he was taken up and carried to St. James's Watch-house, where he was kept all Night. Next Morning the Soldier sent for his Landlady, who gave him the Character of a very innocent inoffensive Man; adding, that he had not been out of her House at the Time the Gentleman said he was robbed.</p>
            <p>HE sent therefore to the Place where he had seen C - h drinking the Night before, to ask the Mistress of the House, If she should know the Soldier that was there last Night, in Company with a Corporal? And upon her answering, She believed she should, were she to see him again, she was desired to step and view him who was in Custody, which she did, and as soon as she set Eyes on him, declared, He was not the Person; for the Man who was at her House, was a tall, clean-looking Fellow, with a Blue Grey Coat, a Red Waistcoat, and a Pair of Buckskin Breeches; besides which he had Reddish Hair, so that she should know him from a Thousand. Upon this her Evidence, and the Character given of him by his own Landlady, the poor Fellow was discharged, and the Foreigner was forced to fit down contentedly with his Loss.</p>
            <p>SOME Time after this, Ruggles and S - being in the Park, they met a Gentleman agreeable to their Mind, whom they accosted as usual, and proposed a Walk to him, to which he readily agreed; whereupon they withdrew to the Side of the Reservoir, in the Green Park, whither Ruggles dogg'd them, and when they were close engaged, ran up. S - h seeing Ruggles at Hand, fastens directly upon him, and crys out, I have got a Molly; and Ruggles coming to his Assistance said, Aha, you Mollying Dog, have I caught you, you shall pay for your Pastime. The Gentleman begged they would not use him Ill; upon which they answered, D - n your Blood, you Dog, what have you got about you? And without further Ceremony rifled him of all his Money, a Gold Watch, and 2 Seals set in Gold, as also an enamel'd Ring with the Name of <persName id="OA17441224n118-1">

            <p>SOME short Time after, they all went out again upon the old Lay, and pick'd up another Bubble in the Park, whom one of them asked to take a Walk, whilst the rest followed at a Distance, and coming up at a Time they judged convenient, they furiously catch'd the Man by the Collar, and cry'd, D - n your Blood, what are you Mollying each other? Whereupon he said, For God's Sake, Gentlemen, don't use me ill, for I am but a poor Man. Whereto they answered, D - n you Blood, don't think to come upon this Lay without Money in your Pocket; and immediately fell to searching him, and took from him an old Bag, with 4 l. 10 s. in Silver, and one Guinea therein, as also 3 Gold Rings, and then left him,</p>

            <p>C - h, S - w, and S - h, going one Way, and Ruggles and B - , with the Bag, another.</p>
            <p>THE two last being thus by themselves, and in the Possession of the Booty, says B - n to Ruggles, Let us open the Bag, and see what we have got. This he readily agreed to, and on so doing the last told 15 s. (as he thought) under a Lamp: Whereupon B - n, who had observed one Piece, which he took for a Guinea (as it really was) cry'd to him, I will take this Shilling, (laying hold thereon) and do you keep another. No, says Ruggles, give me that Shilling, and here is half a Crown, which we will sink between us, and that is better. Upon which B - , slipping his Hand into his Pocket, took out another Shilling and gave him, by which Means he got the Guinea to himself. They proceeded then to a Publick House near St. James's, where they all met by Appointment, and divided the rest of the Money.</p>

            <p>THE ORDINARY of NEWGATE, His ACCOUNT of the Behaviour, Confession, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>GASCOIGN had not staid long in Town, before he entered himself on Board the Barfleur, then lying at Portsmouth, where he staid almost nine Months; in which Time Walters alone committed the following Robberies. One Evening meeting a Welchman, who had brought Cattle to Town to sell, between the New River Head and Islington, he stopt him, and demanded his Money. The Man, either not understanding him, or pretending so, answered him in Welch; upon which Walters told him he must be expeditious, for his Business required it, and was going to put his Hand into his Pockets, but the Man resisted, wherefore he struck him on the Head with his Stick, but did not knock him down. The poor Fellow still continuing to struggle, he gave him a second Blow, which effectually fell'd him to the Ground; after which he took from him his Whip, and 9 s. in Money, and then stroll'd to the <placeName id="OA17441224-geo-56">

The poor Woman, terrify'd greatly, reply'd, Indeed I have nothing, and if you will not believe  search me, but pray don't use me ill: Whereup they did so, and could find but 5 d. which the gave her again, but took her Cloak; after  they impudently ordered her to go to the Ale-house, and spend her 3 d. and tell how she  been served; adding, if they came, they should be served the same Sauce.</p>

The same Night, meeting another in the same Place, they stopp'd him likewise, and as he had no Money, stript him of his Coat. That very Night also, meeting a Third in <placeName id="OA17441224-geo-64">

Gascoign turn'd back and knock'd him down, which done they all made off.</p>

Having gone a little way, and missing Hill, who they thought had followed them, they judg'd the Person whom they had robb'd, had secured him; upon which, Gascoign said, let us go back, as they accordingly did; but a Man coming up to Walters, with a Design to seize him, and crying out, Here he is; Walters having the Cloaths, threw them in his Face, and during the Surprize this put him in, he made off, and ran directly Home to Bed.</p>
            <p>HE had not been long there, however, before Hill and Gascoign came under the Window, and whistled; upon which, Walters knowing their Voices, got up, and went down Stairs to them. Hill's Father was then with them, and he began to tell him, what Danger they had been in, and what a narrow Escape they had; which, however, was not sufficient to make them take warning; for they continued afterwards about an Hour together, with Intent to rob any one they could meet conveniently, wherein, nevertheless, they were disappointed for that Bout; upon which, Walters again returned Home to Bed.</p>

            <p>UPON rummaging the Trunk, they found therein a Velvet Pilgrim, a Hood of the same, with several laced Caps, and Handkerchiefs; as also a small Basket of Nuns Work, covered with Silk, and made to draw up with Ribbons at the Top like a Purse.

In the first of these Partitions they found a Woman's Girdle-Buckle of white Pebble Stones, set in Silver, with a Steel Chape: In the second, were a Pair of Diamond Ear-Rings, a Ring of the same, another of plain Gold, and a Man's Head in Miniature set in the same precious Metal.

In the mean Time the old Gentlewoman left the Street Door upon the Jar, which South observing, ventured in, and went directly up one Pair of Stairs, during which Uptebake and Lemmox stood upon the Watch before the Door. As it happened, however, whilst their Comrade South, who did not go up to be idle, was very busily employed above Stairs, the Oyster Woman, having served her Customer, came out, and not only shut the Door of the Parlour, but that of the Street after her.</p>
            <p>THIS put them into no small Consternation, and they were some Time at their Wits End, how to get South off with his Booty, which, now the Door was shut, they knew must be attended with some Difficulty. Being willing, therefore, to facilitate his Escape as much as they could, both for Fear his being taken should involve themselves in some Danger, and because, knowing him to be a good Hand, and one who would not let any Opportunity slip, they were loth to loose him, they resolved at last to rap boldly at the Door, which Lemmox accordingly did, not doubting, but on that Occasion, to push out.</p>
            <p>IN Effect, just as they had foreseen, every Thing fell out; for, whether South judging who knock'd, and for what Purpose, we know not, but he stood ready at the Turn of the Stairs, and on the old Frenchwoman's going to the Door, and opening it, down Stairs he ran, with what he had laid Hands on, and rushing against her before she could shut it again, pushed her down, and got clear off with them. By this lucky and bold Contrivance, they became Masters of three Mens Coats, a Man's brocaded Night Gown, lin'd with green Shagreen, some Linnen, and a Man's Velvet Cap; all of which they sold to Old true and trusty <persName id="OA17441224n171-1">

            <p>THEIR Devil was very near failing them this Bout; for a little Girl coming by at that Instant, and observing their Motions, cried out, Thieves! Thieves! upon which South leaping hastily out at the Window, and over the Rails, ran one Way, whilst Uptebake scowr'd off the other, with the Shirts; but two Chairmen pursuing the latter closely, he threw the Linnen (last given him by South) under a Gentleman's Coach, which was standing in <placeName id="OA17441224-geo-101">

            <p>ONE would have thought, these two narrow Escapes, and especially the latter, should have kept them in some Awe, and deterr'd them, at least for some Time, from pursuing their former evil Courses; but they were incorrigible, and seemed resolved to verify the old Proverb, He that is born to be hang'd, will never be drowned.</p>

He had not been there above five Minutes, before he came out with two full trimm'd Shirts, and a small Parcel wrapt up in Paper, which prov'd to be a Child's Doll, to their great Mortification as well as the Child's, and all of which they disposed of to Lemmox's Friend, <persName id="OA17441224n183-1">

            <p>IN the mean Time Lemmox went thro' the Entry, and turning the Lock of the Parlour Door, went in; but had not been there above three or four Minutes, before the Gentlewoman, who was behind the Compter, discovered it; for, whether he made more Noise than usual, being in the Dark, or whether her Ears were better than ordinary, she thought she heard somebody walk across the Parlour, and accordingly  starting up from behind the Compter, she  to the Shop Door, and secured it, shutting Uptebake into the Shop, after which she cried out; Thieves! Thieves!</p>
            <p>HEREUPON Lemmox ran out of the Parlour towards the Street, in order to make his Escape, but the Maid coming in at that Instant, met him in the Passage, and did her Endeavour to seize him; in this, however, she was disappointed, for he being too strong for her, threw her down, and so got clear off: He had the Mortification, nevertheless, in the Scuffle, to be obliged to drop all the Things he had taken out of the Parlour, which consisted of a Gold Watch in an Enamell'd Case, a Two-Handle Silver Cup, and some Wearing Apparel.</p>
            <p>NOR was this all, for though he got off himself, his Comrade Uptebake was secured, and would probably have come off but scurvily, wherefore Lemmox resolved to strike a bold Stroke for his Deliverance, and accordingly flying with the utmost Expedition, to a House of Call for Persons of his Stamp, he gathered there a strong Posse, armed with Cutlasses and Hangers, with which he returned, just as the Constable was about to put him into a Coach, in order to carry him before a Magistrate, and taking him away Vi &amp; Armis, conveyed him in Triumph to their old Rendezvous in <placeName id="OA17441224-geo-125">

            <p>THIS narrow Escape, one would have thought, should have induced them to take Warning, und brought them to a better and more serious Way of Thinking, but, alas! they were so hardened in Villainy, as no other Means but putting an End to their Lives, could be supposed effectual for suppressing what further Destruction might but too certainly be apprehended from them.</p>

Accordingly, in about 3 Minutes, he handed a Box to Robinson, who had followed him into the House, and came out therewith: Soon after which, Leekey having made up a Bundle likewise, crept out undiscovered, and all Four hastened away to <persName id="OA17441224n194-2">

Now, says Robinson, let us examine into the Fruits of our Labour: Accordingly, he broke open the Box, and found therein a large Silver Spoon, a Tortoiseshell Snuff Box, with a Silver Rim and Hinge, a Coral, and a Necklace; as also about 4 l. in Gold and Silver, mostly half Guineas, with some odd Things of little Value. Having thus examined into the Contents of the Box, Leekey opened his Bundle, and found therein several Sorts of Mens and Womens Cloaths, with some Child-bed Linnen, all of which they sold to <persName id="OA17441224n195-3">
                  <interp inst="OA17441224n195-3" type="gender" value="female"/>

            <p>THIS ill got Prey, however, was very near causing a Rupture between their hopeful Confederates; for soon after the Commission of this Robbery, the Things were advertised, which occasioned a Discovery, that a Pair of Men's Silver Shoe and Knee Buckles had been fraudulently sunk upon the Co-Partners, and not brought to Account; which heinous and dishonourable Breach of Trust was so highly resented by that Man of strict Honour, <persName id="OA17441224n196-1">

                  <interp inst="OA17441224n196-1" type="given" value="WILLIAM"/>William Robinson</persName>, that upon the first Notice of it he flew to Leekey's Lodgings, and in a furious Rage, d - n'd him, and swore he was a Villain and a Rogue to offer to sink upon him. In Effect, nobody knows what might have been the Consequence of this Resentment, had not Leekey prudently pacify'd him, and compounded the Felony, by telling</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174412240030"/>
            <p>him calmly, Prithee, Will. don't be in such a Passion, for if you will be easy, and not Whiddle, I will give you 6 s. which is half the Money I sold them for. This seasonable Compromise so effectually appeased Robinson, that he immediately answered with an Oath, Aye! now thou art an honest Fellow, and if any one dares say the contrary, d - n my Eyes, I'll blow their Brains out; and accordingly they parted very good Friends.</p>
            <p>ABOUT six Weeks after this, Leekey, Grane, and Uptebake, having agreed to go into the Country, set out all Three together on their Journey, and a little beyond <placeName id="OA17441224-geo-137">

Hereupon Grane, with great Presence of Mind, ran and stopt the Horses; upon which the Gentleman asked, if any one of them could undertake to drive him Home to his House on Turnham-Green? Uptebake immediately said, if he pleased he would get into the Box, and would be sure to drive him home very safe.</p>
            <p>THE Gentleman agreeing thereto, and as there was a Foot Boy belonging to the Chariot on Horseback, who had dismounted on Purpose to take off the Coachman, and convey him to a Publick House till he had slept himself sober, Leekey rode his Beast, and when he came back, he got up together with Grane behind the Chariot. Upon Uptebake's getting into the Box, the Gentleman ordered him to stop at an Alehouse upon the Road; whither being come, and the Landlord stepping out to see what was wanted, he called him by his Name, and desired he would drive him the rest of the Way, with which he readily comply'd.</p>
            <p>HEREUPON Uptebake got down, as did also Grane, from behind the Chariot, and Leekey from the Horse, when the Gentleman gave Uptebake and Grane a Shilling each, but nothing to Leekey. Wherefore, resolving not to be served so, he ran after the Chariot, and being come to the House, saw the Foot Boy take a Bundle out of the Chariot, and carry it into the Hall, and shut the Door after him. Upon this, Leekey knock'd, and a Maid Servant coming to the Gate, demanded what he wanted? He answered, he was one of the young Men who took Care of her Master when his Horses were running away. The Maid immediately went up Stairs with the Message, and acquainting him therewith, he sent down by her a Shilling to him also, but, as she happened not to shut the Door after having delivered it, but went immediately up Stairs again, Leekey, who observed it, thought this too good an Opportunity to be lost, and accordingly stept back into the Hall, and brought away the Bundle, wherewith he returned to his Companions. They highly applauded his Dexterity, and forthwith, they all made the best of their Way to <placeName id="OA17441224-geo-138">

They found therein the Bodies of two Holland Shifts, not made up, a Pair of Sleeves not sew'd in; a Pair of Sheets, a Pair of Leather Clogs, Three Napkins, two Play Books, and some other odd Things, all of which Leekey disposed of for One Guinea, to a Person in that Town; and this was the last Robbery, as far as we can find, wherein they were concerned together.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus given a succinct Account of the principal Robberies, whereof the beforementioned Arch Villains have been pleased to acknowledge themselves Guilty, we cannot help observing, that, upon the Face of the Whole, it appears evidently, that the Persons injured, may chiefly thank themselves, or their Servants, for the Losses they suffered; since it is very plain, they were owing either to Carelessness, in leaving their Doors upon the Latch, in not pinning their Sash Windows, or, in not shutting their Doors after them, when they went out on an Errand, to any Neighbouring Place: We hope, however, this particular Detail will be a sufficient Warning to them to be upon their Guard for the future.</p>

With that the Soldier said, if he would not, he would Fire at him. He said, Do if you dare, for by G - d if you miss me I'll cut your Head off with my Hanger. With that the Soldier levell'd his Musket and Fired at him, but the Ball missed Billingsley, and unfortunately killed a Chairman, who was waiting there.

In the Interim, some of the Neighbours put their Heads out of their Windows, crying out, Murder! Murder! With that one of them pulled a Pistol out of his Pocket, and fired it amongst them, which made them draw their Heads in: Then they fell to Work again, till they broke the Watch House open, and carried Cole off.</p>

            <p>THE Morning following, about five o'Clock, Harper having spent all his Money, pawned his Cloaths, and Field seeing his Companions Poverty, left him, and then he was destitute of both Friends and Money, and every House he went into to enquire after his Companions, was afraid of being taken up.

This was about two Years ago, and they always afterwards went with Pistols, Hangers, and Cutlasses, for fear any of the Thief-takers should offer to take them; they generally went in Numbers, sometimes six, and sometimes ten.</p>
            <p>SOME few Nights after, being six of them in Company, they attack'd a Man and his Wife betwixt the New-Exchange in the Strand, and Charing-Cross, and bid them Stand; Potbury jstled the Man against the Wall, in the mean Time Field did his Endeavour to pick his Pocket of his Watch; the Man made some Resistance, although he had his Child in his Arms, and for fear the Child should be hurt, he said to his Wife, my Dear take the Child, and was handing it to her, with a Design to give them his Money; when Billingsley imagining by his giving the Child away, that he intended to make his Defence, made a fierce Blow at him with a Bludgeon, which unfortunately fell on the Child and killed it; on which the Woman screaming out, they all took to their Heels, and ran away.</p>
            <p>ON Sunday Evening, the Night before their Execution, a Gentleman went to the Press-Yard on Purpose to ask Gadd (the little Boy) some particular Questions, and one of them was, Whether he was one of the Seventeen that went to Copenhagen House on Pretence of getting Mushrooms? He answered, He was, and moreover said, that their real Intentions was to have kill'd Mr. Blewmier, (a Constable belonging to St. James's, Clerkenwell) and one Mr. Foot, (a Headborough belonging to the same Parish, and keeps the Blue Coat-Alehouse just by Clerkenwell Church.) And he further said, that being disappointed, they all came to Town, and went to the Wind-Mill Alehouse in Cow-Cross, arm'd with Pistols, Cutlasses, and Hangers, with a Design to sacrifice Mr. Jones, (the City Marshal) Mr. Boomer, and one Lloyd, (that attends Mr. Jones) which House they knew Mr. Jones was accustomed to frequent. The Gentleman reply'd, suppose Mr. Jones and the two other Persons, had been there, What could you have done. Done, Sir, I could have cut and slash'd away as well as the best of them. The Gentleman was astonished for some Time to hear such an Expression come from the Mouth of a meer Child. He gently reprimanded him, but it had no Effect on him. He seemed entirely ignorant of his unhappy Circumstances, not considering that he was to suffer the next Day. When the Gentleman had done discoursing with him, he was ordered into his Cell again.</p>
            <p>THUS we are at length come to the Close of this dismal Scene, more so indeed on many Accounts, than the Details of former Executions.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174412240037"/>
            <p>For, whether we consider the Number of the Malefactors, the Nature of their Crimes, the Age of some of the Offenders, (one particularly, which was a perfect Child) or the Apprehensions into which the Inhabitants of this great City were for some Time thrown, by their Excessive Boldness in committing their Robberies, all wears the Face of Horror and Confusion.</p>
            <p>BUT let not the Terror it spreads be Momentary, or as it were Instantaneous, and as short as the Pain these Criminals suffer: No, let it be rather lasting as their Shame: Let it set their Errors in a true Light: Let it mark the Road, and point out the Stages that lead to the Gallows; that poor, easy, illiterate young Fellows, may take Warning from their Fate, and fly from the first Seducements of the Devil; as knowing well, (under his Guidance) they must meet here and hereafter with a melancholly Lodging at their Journey's End.</p>
            <p>WE see plainly, that such Practices, how seemingly lucky soever in the first Instances, lead to Penury and Sorrow, instead of Mirth and Plenty: And we as plainly discern, that tho' sometimes Art prevails, and Fraud delivers, yet in the End Ruin certainly attends such Courses, and a just Punishment surely reaches them soon or late.</p>
            <p>BUT the Application of the City of London to His Majesty, has brought a new Vigour to the Laws, and set a keener Edge on the Sword of Justice; so that those fatal Amusements of Friends Assistance, and powerful Interpositions for Pardons, are in a Manner quite removed: It is therefore high Time for every Lover of Idleness and Pleasure, to remember, That the only Way now to be safe, is to be honest, as the only Way to remain honest is to shun bad Company, and live in the Fear of GOD. To which, may he grant, these Reflections may contribute!</p>

            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>I HAVE flatter'd myself, till this last Moment, that a Man, who had had the Honour of being your Servant, would not be suffered to be destroyed. Woeful Expectation, for one who has nothing less to hope for, than a most ignominious Death! How is it possible, that your generous Soul, and your charitable Principles, should be deaf to the Entreaties of an unfortunate Man, who had rather have spill'd the last drop of his Blood, than to have betrayed you? and whose only Guilt is, to have given Way to a cursed Inclination for Gaming, which has made him swerve out his Duty. You can do a great deal in my Behalf, Sir, in God's Name, save my unhappy Days. I confess, I am Guilty, but I have not sinn'd by Inclination; have some Compassion for my poor Family, and for me; we shall all pray for ever for your Prosperity and Preservation; and I shall never cease to be the very last Breath of my Life, with all possible Submission, and a dutiful Respect,</p>

Pray, Madam, let my Tears and my Youth move your Compassion. Shew Mercy to an unhappy Man, and save him from an ignominious Death. Save him a Life which shall be henceforth employed in praying to God for your Prosperity and your Wellfare. Let your Clemency shew the World that no one, who has once had the Honour of being a Servant in your Family, can ever be destroyed, though ever so guilty.

            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>TIS with a Heart penetrated with Grief, and the Image of Death on my Face, that I dare take the Liberty to trouble you for the last time, in order to implore your Clemency in Behalf of an unhappy Servant, who has so greatly offended you, not so much by Inclination, as by his ill Luck, since since I would have always been the most faithful of all Servants, to the best and the most generous of all Masters, if the cursed love of Gaming had not drawn me away. Forgive me, Sir, in the Name of the God of Mercy, as you hope to be forgiven; I humbly ask your Pardon, Sir, with a Heart so full of Grief and Sorrow, that you could not but forgive me, if I could but have the happiness to throw my self at your Feet. The deceitful Hopes, of recovering every Day what I had taken from you, has deluded me, multiplied my Faults, and has ruined me at last. For God's Sake, do not forsake me in my Misfortune. Let my Youth and my Tears excite your Compassion. Save me from an ignominious Death, after having had the Honour of being your Servant, that the Remainder of my Days may be employed in weeping for the Sins I detest, and that I may for ever pray for your Prosperity and Preservation, and publish every where your Goodness to me. Pray, Sir, favour me with your Protection in these my deplorable Circumstances. 'Tis your Protection alone, that can draw me out of the Abyss, wherein my irregular Conduct has precipitated me: vouchsafe to obtain my Reprieve from his Majesty. 'Tis in your Power, Sir, have some Compassion on a poor Servant, whose life is in your Disposal, grant it him out of Charity; your Generosity cannot but do you Honour in the World; the Lord will Reward you for it, and I shall always have as long as I breathe, the deepest Sentiments of the most sincere Gratitude, and of a most profound Respect, being,</p>

The whole Course of my Life shall for the future be employed in praying to God for your own and my Lady's Prosperity. If your Clemency and your Compassion produce a merciful Judgement, all my Relations, (whom I am very sorry to have dishonour'd by my Faults) as well as myself, shall for ever entertain the deepest Sense of Gratitude for the same. I beseech you, Sir, for God's Sake, to cast an Eye of Pity on my most sad Condition; I never would have been guilty of such a Crime to deprive another Person of his Property, in order to enrich myself, and 'twas only the cursed Inclination for Gaming, which has been the Cause of my Ruin and which deluded me with the hopes of being  to recover what was lost, and to return it again: how happy should I be, if my Tears could prevail upon you, my Chains, and the Thoughts of an approaching ignominious Death, have already destroyed my Health, and I am half dead in this dark Dungeon. Pray, Sir, have some Consideration for my Youth, and so kind to represent my Case to his Majesty. May Heaven preserve your Health, and pour his Blessings on you, and my Lady. I am with a profound Respect and Submission,</p>
            <p>Your most humble, Most obedient, and Most afflicted Servant,</p>
