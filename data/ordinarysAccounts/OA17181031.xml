            <p>THE Ordinary of NEWGATE HIS ACCOUNT OF The Behaviour, Confessions, and Last Speeches of the Malefactors that were Executed at Tyburn on Friday the 31st of October, 1718.</p>
            <p>AT the General Sessions held at Justice-Hall in the Old-Baily, on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday the 10th, 11th, and 12th of September last, 13 Men that were Try'd for and Convicted of several Capital Crimes, receiv'd Sentence of Death accordingly. And at the last Sessions held at the same Place on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this instant October, Eight Men and One Woman, then likewise Try'd for, and found Guilty, viz. Two of Murder, and the rest of Felony without the Benefit of the Clergy, did also receive such a Sentence: But of the former (who were Thirteen in number) One dying after a long illness in the Dungeon, commonly call'd the Condemn'd Hold, on Sunday the 12th instant, and 8 of the 12 Men who remain'd of that number, with 5 of this latter, having obtain'd a most gracious Reprieve, 8 only are now order'd for Execution.</p>
            <p>While they lay under this Condemnation, I constantly visited them, and had them twice every Day brought up to the Chapel of Newgate, where I pray'd with them, and read and expounded the Word of GOD to them, which as they seem'd to give great Attention to, so I hope they were edify'd and comforted by it; being made sensible they had greatly offended GOD, injur'd their Neighbours, and polluted their own Souls. These I daily laid before them to consider, as Things of the greatest import to them, and which (by the Assistance of the Divine Grace intervening) might bring them into a state of sincere Repentance, and prepare them for a happy and glorious Eternity.</p>
            <p>On the Lord's Days following I preach'd to them, both in the Forenoons and Afternoons, upon the Texts hereafter set down, viz.</p>
            <p>The 14th of the last Month, upon the 19th Psalm, Ver. 7. The Law of the Lord is a perfect Law, converting the Soul: The Testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the Simple.</p>
            <p>Having first explain'd both Text and Context in general, I then spoke in particular to these several Points resulting therefrom, viz.</p>
            <p>I. The Nature of GOD, who is our great Legislator or Law-giver.</p>
            <p>II. The Spirituality and Extent of his Law.</p>
            <p>III. The Vivacity and Strength of our own Souls, for whose sakes (chiefly) this Law is given us.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA171810310002"/>
            <p>IV. The Opposition we meet within our selves, and the many Temptations and Assaults we have from without, whenever we are endeavouring to prepare our Souls, and bring them to a just Conformity and due Obedience to the Divine Law.</p>
            <p>V. The many Miscarriages of our past Lives, notwithstanding our Knowledge of the indispensable Duty of our obeying that Law.</p>
            <p>VI. ult. The miserable Toil and Slavery of a Life of Sin; and by what means we may be releas'd out of it, and admitted into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God.</p>
            <p>The 21st of the same Month my Text was this, Luke 15. 1, 2. Then drew near unto Him all the Publicans and Sinners, for to hear Him: And the Pharisees and Scribes murmured, saying, This Man receiveth Sinners, and eateth with them.</p>
            <p>From which Words, first explain'd at large, I then shew'd,</p>
            <p>I. What was this Coming of the Publicans and Sinners to Christ; their good and pious Intent, and the blessed Effect thereof, viz. their receiving Divine Instruction and Spiritual Comfort to their Souls.</p>
            <p>II. The Pharisees Pride and Arrogancy, which made them murmur at Christ, and envy those poor Sinners who desir'd to repent and become Good Men, and therefore resorted to Christ, to hear and learn of Him the Heavenly and Saving Doctrine he taught.</p>
            <p>The 28th of the aforesaid Month of September last I took these Words for my Text, Matt. 11. 29, 30. Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart: And ye shall find Rest unto your Souls. For my Yoke is easie, and my Burden is light.</p>
            <p>After a general Explanation of the Text, I divided it into, and distinctly discours'd upon, these four Parts; shewing,</p>
            <p>I. Who He is that invites in the Text.</p>
            <p>II. Who They are that we find invited.</p>
            <p>III. What sort of Invitation this is.</p>
            <p>IV. and lastly, What great Arguments are used to perswade Men to accept of it.</p>
            <p>The 5th of this instant October, upon 2 Pet. 3. 9. The Lord is not slack concerning his Promise (as some Men count slackness) but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance.</p>
            <p>From this Text and Context I observ'd,</p>
            <p>I. That CHRIST, who had promis'd, That He will one Day come to judge the World; and, That He will then receive the Good and Penitent to Himself, and destroy the Wicked and Impenitent, is able to perform his Promise to the uttermost.</p>
            <p>II. That He who has made this Promise and Declaration, is yet longsuffering to us-ward; being so Merciful as to bear with us for a time, and not bring us to speedy Judgment</p>
            <p>III. That one great Reason of that his transcendent Mercy to us, is, That none of us should perish.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA171810310003"/>
            <p>IV. ult. That the only Way to prevent this perishing (tho' not that Judgment) is to improve such Mercy into Repentance; which the Apostle intimates here is the Design of Christ's delaying his Coming.</p>
            <p>The 12th instant, upon Mark 6. 12. And they went out and preach'd, That Men should repent.</p>
            <p>From these Words, first explain'd in general, with their Context, I shew'd in particular,</p>
            <p>I. The Nature of Repentance.</p>
            <p>II. The absolute Necessity of it.</p>
            <p>III. The great Danger of delaying it.</p>
            <p>IV. &amp; lastly, The blessed Effects of a timely and constant Practice of it.</p>
            <p>Upon the several Heads of all those Sermons I enlarg'd, and concluded them with suitable Exhortations to the Condemn'd, who did all appear to be very serious and attentive to those Instructions and Admonitions I then gave them.</p>
            <p>And again on the Lord's Day the 19th instant, when I had Nine Persons more added to those condemn'd before, I likewise preach'd to them, both in the Morning and Afternoon, upon Eccl. 1. 9. Rejoice, O Young-man in thy Youth, and let thy Heart cheer thee in the days of thy Youth, and walk in the way of thy Heart, and in the sight of thine Eyes: But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into Judgment.</p>
            <p>From this Text, first open'd in general, I laid down these Points to be severally spoken to, viz.</p>
            <p>I. That there is a Judgment to come, and very strict and severe it will be against all harden'd and impenitent Sinners.</p>
            <p>II. That all Men shall be brought to that Judgment.</p>
            <p>III. That it is GOD, the Great Judge of the whole World, who will bring them to it.</p>
            <p>IV. That the Matter of it will be the Way of their own Heart, and the Sight of their Eyes; which implies their Thoughts, Words, and Deeds.</p>
            <p>V. ult. That all this is sure, and evident, from this positive Expression in the Text, Know thou [not Think or Believe, but Know] know thou, that for all these Things [i. e. thy Evil Thoughts, Wicked Words, and Sinful Actions] GOD will bring thee into Judgment.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I preach'd again (the 26th instant) on part of the 2d Evening Lesson, viz. Ephes. 6. 18. Praying always with all Prayer and Supplication in Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance.</p>
            <p>After a Paraphrastical Explanation both of this Text and Context, I distinctly shew'd what is to be understood by those Phrases,</p>
            <p>1st, Praying always.</p>
            <p>2dly, With all Prayer and Supplication.</p>
            <p>3dly, In the Spirit, and watching thereunto.</p>
            <p>4thly, With all perseverance.</p>
            <p>Then I proceeded to discourse upon these Points resulting therefrom, viz.</p>
            <p>I. The indispensable Necessity of Prayer.</p>
            <p>II. The proper Disposition and due Qualifications for it.</p>
            <p>III. ult. The transcendent Advantages accruing from it.</p>
            <p>Having enlarg'd on all those Heads, I concluded each of my several Sermons (which were 14 in number) with suitable Exhortations and Applications to the Condemn'd Persons in particular, endeavouring both in publick and private to give them such proper Instructions as their sad Circumstances requir'd, and might prove conducive to their Repentance and Salvation, which they did all of 'em (some more, some less) shew a Concern for: And those appointed to this Death gave me the respective Accounts of themselves which follow.</p>

Upon this I shew'd him the Cause of his Relapse; which was (as he now acknowledg'd) his not minding afterwards his Resolutions, and the Promises he had made both to GOD and Man, of amending his Life; which he (under this last Condemnation) seem'd to be very sensible of, and sorry for his Abuse of former Mercies, praying GOD to forgive him all his Sins, and the Persons by him wrong'd, the Injuries he had done them.</p>
