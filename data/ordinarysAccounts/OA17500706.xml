And now the Passion, which once shewed itself in Fondness and Tenderness, broke out into Rage and Jealousy; and instead of that mutual Affection, which Matrimony should be the Parent of, this barbarous Treatment obliged her to shun him, who should have been her Protector against all Evil and Danger. At first she says, she had not given him Reason for such Suspicion, or ill Usage, nor did for a long while, till at length his Behaviour drove her from him, and she was forced to take Shelter where she could find it; she went to her Parents, and they received her for a Time, but upon his telling them their parting was her own Fault, they would advise her to go Home again; and having given her good Instructions, sent her back to her Husband. Upon her Return she always meet with the same Usage, and even when at Table they have seemingly been good Friends, and in a sociable Manner eating and drinking together. She says, he has often taken his Scymeter, or Hanger from his Side, and of a sudden falling into a Rage, has frequently given her several Cuts therewith over her Head and Face. And her Head is so full of Scars all over, from the Forehead to the back of her Head, that there is scarce the Breadth of a Finger between, and several she has about her Eyes; all which at different Times were given her, she says, by her Husband Harvey.</p>

            <p>All this, she says, she bore with, and could have borne with more through the Love that she bore unto him, even tho' her Life was at Risque every Day, and Hour. But one Time, while he was Abroad, she got into Company with some of her own Sex, and repeating her Grievance to them, they said she was a Fool not to be revenged. She answered, she knew not how. They told her she must forsake her Husband entirely, and think of him no more; and that if she would do so, there was a certain Gentleman, who had seen her, and liked her, and pitied her Case, and that if she would forsake her Husband, and live with him, she would be sure to meet with good Usage. With these, and such other plausible and fair Speeches, she says, she was prevailed on to give up her Honour, to break her Vows, and to defile her Marriage Bed. This coming to her Husband's Knowledge, he resolved to see her no more, and returning from Sea, came to <placeName id="OA17500706-geo-10">

The Day the Fireworks (in Honour of the late glorious Peace,) were exhibited, she got Leave of her Mistress to make a Holiday; but the the worst Day it has proved, in the Event, that ever she saw, and from thence she seems to date the Period of her Ruin; for that Day she first fell into the Acquaintance of some of the Company, that were present at, and put her upon committing the Robbery for which she suffered. She, together with three or four Sailors, and some Women, spent that Day in Rioting and Drunkenness, and continued so for some Days; so that tho' her Mistress had been before her particular Friend, out of a Sense of having displeased her, she chose not to return Home again.

She lamented greatly her unhappy Condition, and always repeated her Innocence, and that she never wronged Man, Woman, nor Child in her Life, but worked hard for her Living.</p>
            <p>As to the Fact for which she suffered, if really guilty, she richly deserved her Fate; and the Child being with her, and the Cloaths belonging to it tied up in a Bundle, seem Circumstances of sufficient Proof. But all this notwithstanding, she persisted to the last in denying the Fact. It was sworn at her Trial, that she owned the taking the Child from near <placeName id="OA17500706-geo-36">

            <p>would hold the Child and the Bundle, while she went to a House which she pointed to, just by Marybone Road, she would give her Twopence. She was willing to get the Money, as she says, so easily, not thinking she should pay so dear for it; and she saw the Woman go to the House she mentioned. What became of her afterwards she does not know. She waited, she says, a long Time, and the Woman not returning, she went up to the House, and enquiring of the Maid-servant, what was become of the Woman? was told, that she came in, and was about to go up Stairs; but some how or other turned back, saying, I ask Pardon, I have mistaken the House; and so went out again. If it be a Story of her own, it is artfully contrived; but this she always declared was the Truth of the Matter, though I told her the Danger of persisting in a Lie, and that it was too late to think of saving her Life by concealing the Truth. I told her, it was very improbable that any one should go to strip a Child, and immediately give away what was got by it, as must be the Case if her Story was true. But she replied, that however improbable what she said might appear, she still continued in the same Tale; and to account for it, was artful enough to say, she believed the Woman who gave her the Child and Bundle to hold, had concerted the Matter with others, on Purpose to take away her Life, with a View of a Reward.</p>
            <p>She always appeared very penitent, wept and lamented bitterly, and said, with her last Breath she would pray for her Prosecutors, and hoped that God would forgive both her and them for what they had done.</p>

And thus she was persuaded by her Husband, and others concerned, that no Harm nor Danger was in the Part she was to act in this Affair; which made her go about it the more openly, and take the less Care to secrete herself after she had done; for, says she, I went Home, and appeared openly in <placeName id="OA17500706-geo-47">

Before she was apprehended, her Husband had left her, and carried off every Thing she had that was valuable, not only the Money she suffered for receiving of by false and fraudulent Means, but the Rings, and the very Cross she was wont to wear about her Neck, being a <rs id="OA17500706-occupation-25" type="occupation">Roman Catholick</rs>

She confesses the uttering the false Will, and receiving the Money, but always said, what she did in it was at her Husband's Instigation; I asked her if she was at that Time sensible of the ill Consequences of such a wicked Undertaking, if it came to Light? And she answered in the Affirmative; and added, that tho' he had used her very ill at diverse Times heretofore, yet, whether through Love, or Fear, or both. she could not determine, but she could not help doing as he bid her; She acknowledged her Guilt too by saying, she was privy to the Forgery, but kept it secret, not expecting to be made the Cat's Paw of, (in her own Terms expressed) but that by the Influence of her Husband's Commands, and his Directions where to receive the Money, she went and did receive it; but that he being with her, immediately took it from her, and made off the Ground, knowing the Danger if the Fraud was discovered. She behaved very well during the wholeTime of her Confinement in <placeName id="OA17500706-geo-51">

            <p>They gave the above Account of themselves almost in todidem verbis, at different Times, and repeated. Whatever else they might have been guilty of, it all died with them, and no further Confession would either of them make of their past Life and Conversation. And though there may be Reason to believe, had they been open and ingenuous, their Minds had more to reflect on than what is here collected, and more Instances of Wickedness might have been exposed; yet they would by no Means declare further, unless concerning such Things as are better concealed than exposed to publick View and Inquiry.</p>
