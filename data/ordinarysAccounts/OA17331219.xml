            <p>When under Sentence, in order to an effectual preparation for Death, they were exhorted to double their diligence, as being confin'd to a very short Time, since a faint endeavour will never go through with any Work, which requires either length of Time, or strength of Labour. If one put little strength to it, that will not conquer the difficulty of the Task, and if he is soon wearied, he will give over before it come to an End. So that a Man must apply himself to the same, both earnestly and long, if he would succeed when he has begun, and go on to finish and compleat it.</p>
            <p>Now our obeying God, and amending of our Lives is a Work of this kind; for our Sins being many in Number, they will require some Time before they are all amended, and our hindrances in leaving them being great, and the temptations Strong, that Daily assault and draw us to them, and our own Lusts, and a treacherous Enemy in our own Bosoms, being always ready to take their Parts and strike in with them, it requires a great Watchfulness, and a constant care, and an earnest vigorous endeavour to overcome them. And this the Scripture tells us plainly we must use, if ever we expect to prevail against them. St. Peter tells us, we must give all diligece, 2 Pet. 1. 5, 10. St. Paul, that we must be circumspect, Eph. 5. 15. Our blessed Saviour that we must watch always, and be ever standing upon our Guard. Mark 13. 37. And strive to enter in at the streight Gate, Luke 13. 24. which striving is called a Warfare. 2. Cor. 10. 4. and a Fight, 1. Tim. 6. 12. all which show the greatness of that</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173312190005"/>
            <p>Care, and both the Earnestness and Constancy of that Endeavour, which we must lay out upon it.</p>
            <p>The Fault of those who pursue Obedience by proper Methods, and yet miss of it at last, is this, They endeavour but by halves, and seek it, either by too short, or too flight Pains. They want Resolution to set manfully about it, or the Patience to go through with it; wherefore I exhorted them to use their utmost Care, in working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling; and wherein they came short, to implore the Assistance of God's Grace, that he, by the powerful Influences of the Holy Ghost, who is promised to all Christians, who sincerely seek him; with perfect Strength in their Weakness, and Wisdom in their Folly, and make them willing and obedient in the Day of his Power.</p>
            <p>One of them having been convicted of Murther, I expos'd the great Evil of that atrocious Crime, both as to the Nature of the Sin itself, and its dreadful Consequences, as entailing inevitable Misery upon a Man, both in a present and future Life, if not prevented by a true and hearty Repentance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I explain'd to them the great Design of the Christian Sacraments, by which we are engag'd and confirm'd in the Service of God; and particularly I insisted on the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, left in Legacy by Christ to his Church, as a Token of that everlasting Love he bears us, from these Words, And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in Breaking of Bread, and in Prayers, Acts ii. 42. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>When these and many like Instructions were given, such as could read made regular Responses, and all of them were apparently devout, and very attentive both to Prayers and Exhortations. <persName id="OA17331219n20-1">

He never associate himself with any Gangs of Thieves, but them who were taken up with him; and if he had not been discover'd, he intended to go to his Business again. He was much addicted to Drinking, Gaming, and Swearing, which exposed him to many Inconveniencies, brought him into a habit of Idleness, and occasioned his falling into wicked Actions. He was very ignorant, but mighty desirous of Instruction, and most attentive to Prayers and Exhortations.</p>

            <p>Another time being of a Sunday, I went over as usual, and missing the Money in the Drawers (my Brother being in the Kitchen) and there being a Press Bed in the Shop wherein he used to lie; I took his Breeches from off the Teaster of the Bed, and took from</p>

            <p>The next Day myself and Addison went into the Country and stay'd till about two o'Clock the next Morning before we came home, where my Brother and another waited for me, and brought me over the Water, charging me with robbing him,which I stifly denied; and having an Opportunity tied the Money which I had left in the Tail of my Shirt, and about five Guineas in my Shoes, which upon searching me they found; but not pulling off my Breeches they did not find the Remainder; on which after Threatning they left me in the House and I got away, and went to my Companions at W-n's House, and told them all that happened, and what Money I had sav'd when we fell to drinking; but was informed by W-n, that my Brother had been there to make an Inquiry how I liv'd; when W-n told him that I was his Follower (he being Bailiff) and by that means got a great deal of Money, besides what I got by my own Business of a Farrier.</p>
            <p>But one time in Particular (my Brother being Constable) Addison and the other persuaded me to go and rob him, which I did in the following manner; Addison, myself and the other, went from W-n's House while my Brother was at Church, when I opened the Door, they standing by to watch, and I robbed him of Fifty Guineas, a Silver Watch and a Ring, and came out again and lock'd the Street-door undiscovered.</p>

            <p>IT curing so easily, and insensibly, as to any Disorder it gives, Confinement it requires, or Suspicion it occasions, that it is admir'd and recommended by all that have taken it, for it neither purges, vomits, nor salivates, but cures by its Alterative,  Antiereal Qualities, in so much that Children and the weakest and most tender or crazy constitution'd People may take it at all times of the Year, and go about with it as if they had taken nothing, as may likewise those who have been brought near the Grave, by repeated unsuccessful Salivations, or other violent, or too frequent Purgations, or Vomits; for it restores as well as clears the Blood, Head, and whole Habit, of all the lurking poisonous Taint, and Mercury tho' never so secretly lodg'd in the Body; wherefore let none of these unfortunate People despair, but try it, and they will be comfortably convinc'd of the Truth of what is here said of it,</p>
            <p>Persons who are pox'd to the last Degree, their whole Mass of Blood being contaminated, and have been told that nothing but a Salivation would Cure them tho' they Labour under tormenting Pains in the Head, Limbs or Joints; or have breakings out, Scabs, Blotches, Boiles, or Spots; or have Swellings, Nodes Sores or Ulcers, either in their Throat, Nose, or elsewhere, with weariness in the Limbs, Faintness and Weakness of the whole Body, &amp;c. may intirely rely upon it, only, that according to the Degree of the Infection, they must take it and continue it for a longer or shorter Time.</p>
            <p>Such as have only some Relicks of the Disease, or but suspect that their Blood has got a Smatch of the Taint, by some unusual Uneasinesses about them, which they now and then feel, either from ill manag'd Claps, or other doubtful Cures, should never venture to marry, if they are single, nor meddle with their Wives if marry'd, till they are sure they are safe, as they most certainly will be, upon their only taking a Pot or two of it.</p>
            <p>It is a  pleasant to take, as well as , its ; and cleanse, Nourishes and Restores, the  most weak  and worn out Constitutions.</p>
