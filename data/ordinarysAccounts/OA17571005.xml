            <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
            <p>- Facilis descensus averni:</p>
            <p>Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis;</p>
            <p>Sed revocare gradum, superasq; evadere ad auras,</p>
            <p>Hoc opus, hic labor est.</p>
            <p>The gates of hell are open night and day:</p>
            <p>Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:</p>
            <p>But to return, and view the chearful skies;</p>
            <p>In this the task, and mighty labour lies.</p>
            <p>IT is no idle station to be posted at the gloomy avenue of death, there to receive the unwilling traveller, and conduct him in a path, the reverse of what he had chosen to tread, through the course of his former life: to meet the reluctant passenger on the brink of eternity's boundless ocean, and there open and point out, (if not secure) to him a passage to the land of everlasting life, who had before wilfully plunged himself into the attractive whirlpool of misery's abyss; to draw him thence as a drowning man; to revive the worse than senseless mass, to a moral sense and spiritual life; all this is no light task; it demands not only human endeavours, but divine assistance; it demands not only the zeal and diligence, the skill and vigilance of a faithful servant, but bespeaks the favourable wishes and aids, shall I add, the fervent prayers of all who wish prosperity to so necessary and valuable a work. If an ox or an ass fallen into a pit, be an object of care and compassion, how much more is a man, indued with an immortal soul, when in danger of sinking into the pit of everlasting destruction.</p>
            <p>To this design, there are many requisites rather to be wished and hoped for, than suddenly obtained: Such as, that the time and means were more adequate to the end and purpose *, to make success more probable, evil habits should be rooted out, and * To this the excellent plan of a new prison, or rather workhouse, wherein labour, industry, and virtue might be practised, and idleness, vice and profaneness, more effectually prevented and suppressed, would, if executed, greatly conduce: a design, the weight of which, it should seem unreasonable to lay on the metropolis only, as it ought to be borne in some due proportion by the body of the nation. May I venture to advance, that this is a common concern, and fit to be imitated by every county or district.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175710050003"/>
            <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
            <p>the contrary good habits planted in succession. Idleness and the love of vicious pleasures, at least the temptations and opportunities to them, being removed, should be succeded by useful and wholesome labour, and the practice of temperance, soberness, and chastity; impious oaths and curses, and filthy conversation, the transgression and contempt of laws divine and human, should be changed for a course of sound instruction, the duties of piety, and a due observance and high respect for those laws and commandments which are the bonds and barriers of human society, and the means of human felicity.</p>
            <p>But how can all, or any of these good purposes, be attempted or hoped for in the time and place that unhappy malefactors and convicts are confined to, during the little interval between their commital and trial, or between sentence and execution.</p>
            <p>For however some empirics in theology may boast of instantaneous conversions, and sadden changes in moral characters, let me not envy them, but heartily wish them more sincere and frequent than they are; yet, is it much to be doubted whether this method of dealing with men be agreeable to the course of divine providence in the works of nature, or dispensations of grace. I grant, indeed, the seeds of virtue, and a spiritual life may be sown in an instant; but their taking root, their growth and production of fruit must have time; and therefore, in the common course of things, it seems necessary to allow time and means, rational human means, for any real changes, and hopeful preparations for eternity.</p>
            <p>The best use to be made of these considerations for the present, is, that all persons be warned from thence, to be doubly on their guard against such company and courses as may betray them into these desperate and deplorable circumstances of meeting death, disarmed against its terrors, and unprepared for its consequences.</p>
            <p>The readers of taste, who may deign to look into this account, it is hoped, will not be offended at its plain narrative stile, as being given in the words of the person treated of, as near as may be, and the descriptions of their behaviour taken from the life, in order to give a natural and striking picture of them. And the public in general is requested to excuse the delay of publishing, on account of the number of sufferers to be spoken of; the important uses to be made of so shocking a calamity, to recompence, in some measure, the loss of her members to the society; and the strict regard to truth and decency, with which all have a right to be treated by the writer.</p>

            <p>These unhappy people, after their conviction did, when capable, duly and regularly attend divine service in the chapel, and behaved themselves with attention, humility, and devotion at it; happy for them if this had been the rule and method of their former life, probably they had never fallen under this condemnation !</p>
            <p>It must be owned, some of them being illiterate, void of any thoughts of any religion, and ignorant of its first principles, cost the minister much time and pains, frequent admonitions and instructions to bring them to any sense of their true condition and their duty. But he humbly hopes his labour was not bestowed in vain, even on such as these. And he begs leave to take this first public opportunity to return his humble thanks to the right honourable the lord-mayor, and the right worshipful, and worshipful members of the court of aldermen for their generous and unmerited favour of an unanimous election conferred on him, and giving him this inestimable occasion of doing good to those that are ready to perish; nor can he forget to offer the same humble thanks to a right worshipful member of the same court (whose name he dare not mention without his permission) for his pious care in visiting the chapel, and pointing out some repairs necessary for the decency of divine service, and the health and convenience of those who frequent it, and for his present of the Prisoner's Director: To another worshipful member of the same court for his present of six common-prayer books to the chapel for the use of the prisoners: To the venerable society for promoting Christian knowledge for their seasonable present of twelve compassionate addresses to prisoners for crimes; and for twelve affectionate addresses to prisoners for debt, sent to the ordinary for the use of the prison; which were distributed in part, among the prisoners according to his best discretion, and which he observed many of them making good use of to their last moments; and lastly he returns his thanks to the reverend the secretary</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175710050006"/>
            <p>of the society, for his kind overtures of farther assistance in that way.</p>
            <p>The public, it is hoped, will excuse the mention of these favours on this occasion, as they were an immediate benefit to the convicts now under consideration; and must prove so to the future. To some further particulars relating to the former, I now proproceed.</p>

Notwithstanding this success, he was seized with horror, at his cool moments of reflection for what he had done; he dreaded the sight or company of his associate, shunned him, and when haunted and teazed perpetually by him to go on new adventures, he determined to move his habitation in the most secret manner he could, where he hoped to be undiscovered by his seducer. He did so, but in vain. He was found out and roundly threatened to this purpose. " Harding, I see what you " are about; you mean to impeach " and turn evidence, but, if you " don't come along with me, as usual, I will be beforehand, and do " for you." He judged there was no extricating himself from this net.

Whatever became of this project, their casual meeting quickly engaged them in worse purposes, which brought them under the fatal sentence. During the respite of long vacation, Harding flattered himself that his friends could save him, which though he was often warned against as a most dangerous delusion, yet it prevailed so far over him, as to make him less intent on a real preparation for death, and more reserved in his confession. He often promised indeed that in case his life was spared he would write a particular account of it, and the facts he had been concerned in, for the warning of others and the publick safety. This he proposed as a kind of commutation or recompence for his life, which he kept in reserve for that purpose; but when he found his name in the death warrant how was he struck with sorrow, confusion and disappointment! The load of his guilt and the fears of death and judgment, came upon him at once, an horrible dread overwhelmed him, he quaked violently, as one in an ague, and his teeth chattered, he spent his sleepless nights in wailing, and shedding floods of tears, insomuch that he could neither read nor pray, this I learned not only from himself and my own observation, but from <persName id="OA17571005n43-1">

            <p>When I re-examined Long, hoping to find he had learned something necessary to his salvation, he told me, Harding could not speak to him, nor pray with him, for crying and sobbing the whole night. O consider this ye that forget God! seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near; let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, the first moment he is called, especially when called by the chastising hand of God, lest in the great waterfloods of sudden fear and extreme calamity, they be not suffered to come nigh him: However, I endeavoured to compose, comfort, and restore this bruised reed all I could; and I hope with some success; for it was not till now that he told me of the first robbery he had committed with Boswell, and how he was in a drunken frolick drawn in, and irrecoverably intangled in the snare, as above related. Thus these vile seducers into villainy, like the arch-fiend their master, whose work they do, and whose wages they will receive, first tempt, and then betray.</p>
            <p>Out of this snare it was my task to recover him, he had long since professed to me, that he did all he could to repent; that he resolved to live a godly, righteous, and sober life, and hoped he should be a better christian than ever he had been were his life spared.</p>

            <p>Besides the many suspicious circumstances of forgery which appeared in this bond, as to the pretended creditor and witnesses, and convinced mr.

            <p>Besides some inconsistencies in these supposed securities, and her several answers in Chancery relating to them; many witnesses being examined on both sides, it appeared she did not examine a single witness to prove the existence of this <persName id="OA17571005n59-1">

And notwithstanding all her precaution, she was also unlucky in the date of this bond; for a letter was found by mr. Curgee, goldsmith in Fleetstreet, where the late mr. Bridge had lodged for fourteen years. This letter was dated the 9th of March, at Burford in Oxfordshire, 70 miles from London, being the very day of the date of the two bonds aforesaid.</p>
            <p>To obviate this inconsistency, Eddowes had recourse to another most extraordinary piece of forgery, viz. of six or seven letters, of a supposed correspondence kept up between this <persName id="OA17571005n60-1">

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175710050013"/>
            <p>from the spelling and manner of expression, no man could hesitate a moment.</p>
            <p>Issues being directed by my lordchancellor, the whole matter was tried before my lord Mansfield last May, by a special jury of gentlemen in Westminster-hall; and after a full hearing by witnesses, the jury brought in a verdict against the bond, and notes, and letters. She was committed by lord Mansfield, and mr. Bridge bound over to prosecute.</p>
            <p>On the prosecution and trial, it appeared, that she published the bond by producing it to her attorney to make a demand, and bring an action; that in her answers in Chancery, she avowed it to be a good bond; left it in court for the inspection of the plaintiff, and at last attended at the trial, where it was read as evidence for her. This was proved on the evidence of mr. Hanley and mr. Mould of the Six Clerks Office, mr. Powel the attorney, mr. Guy, one of the examining clerks in Chancery, and mr. Collison, record keeper to mr. Zinks, one of the six clerks.</p>
            <p>It was also proved, that this bond was not executed by mr. Bridge, nor was it his hand-writing, by several gentlemen of character and credit, who very well knew his hand-writing, and positively declared, this was not his hand-writing to the best of their knowledge. Mr. Ellisle, who had intercourse with him in the way of business, declared on oath, he did not believe it to be his hand-writing, and very little, if any thing like it. A letter was produced by the prisoner, asking this witness, if that were mr. Bridge's hand-writing; he answer'd, that was more like it, but he did not think that to be his hand-writing.</p>
            <p>Mr. Atkinson, clerk to mr. Hoare the banker, where mr. Bridge kept cash many years; knew him 15 years, often saw him write, and knew his hand-writing, produced his name in his book, and to a receipt which he saw him write, and comparing these with the name, and filling up of the bond, verily believed, neither of these latter were his hand-writing, nor yet the letter produced by the prisoner, to the former witness: all which on this occasion, the jury compared together.</p>
            <p>Mr. Baldwin gave the like evidence: mr. Romans, clerk to mr. Burroughs, one of the masters in Chancery, produced four letters put into his hands by mr. <persName id="OA17571005n66-1">

            <p>Thus the court and jury had full evidence, and sufficient means of judging whether the bond, &amp;c. were a forgery or not.</p>
            <p>The next point proved was, that mr. Bridge had no occasion to borrow this money; and it appeared on the evidence of mr. Atkinson, that he had kept cash at mr. Hoare's many years: that from 1743, to March 1747;</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17571005n72-4" type="given" value="ANNA MARIA"/>Anna Maria Edwards</persName>, (who she was did not appear) and that he would have gladly sold this for ten guineas: that he then asked the prisoner, how is it consistent with reason, that a woman abroad should make such a silly fellow as <persName id="OA17571005n72-5">
                  <interp inst="OA17571005n72-5" type="gender" value="male"/>

            <p>To all this charge the prisoner made no defence; but by some assertions without proof, as that there was a combination against her, and they misled the court and the jury, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After conviction in the gaol, she took advantage of the brief manner in which the jury's verdict is expressed in the printed trial, Guilty of publishing it: to say she was not found guilty of forgery, nor was the bond found to be forged, nor herself guilty of publishing it knowing it to be forged; and therefore she died unjustly, and against the law. It was in vain to reason with her, or persuade her to a confession of her guilt: she obstinately adhered to these assertions to her last moment, as will more fully appear from the following letter of her's on this subject.</p>

            <p>The reader will make his own judgment and reflections on the comparison of this letter with the abstract of the trial: that she knew it to be a forgery is proved and inferred from the general nature of the transaction, from the facts and circumstances arising from it, from the many inconsistencies in her answers in Chancery; from producing the bond, without making any demand on the notes from those six or seven letters, produced by her to suppor the bond, appearing to be so gross and palpable a forgery, &amp;c. these left no doubt, but that she knew this bond, and notes were not drawn by mr. Bridge.</p>
