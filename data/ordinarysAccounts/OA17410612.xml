            <p>While under Sentence, they were instructed from these Words, " Then " said Jesus to his Disciples, if any " Man will come after me, let him " deny himself and take up his Cross " and follow me, St. MATH. 16, 24." From whence was observ'd to them, that tho' the most faithful Servants of the Lord, even the Patriarchs and Apostles, endur'd most unjust Reproaches and Persecutions in this World, yet were they made happy in the next, by patiently submitting and bearing their Sufferings. How much more, then ought they who have been most notoriously wicked here, to submit patiently to suffer the most</p>

            <p>exemplary Punishments, rather than endure an Eternity of Misery hereafter.</p>
            <p>'Twas urg'd to them, how much it was their Duty, to cry unto the Lord, Day and Night, for Forgiveness of their manifold Sins and Wickedness; to that God who is a Merciful God, and will as has been promised in the Holy Scriptures: When the Wicked Man turneth away from the Wickedness that he hath committed, and doth that which is Lawful and Right, shall save his Soul alive; for if we seek God in Sincerity, he will surely be found, and however great and many our Offences have been, yet there is infinite Mercy with God to forgive them. They were all exhorted from these and the like Words, to be sincere and penitent.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17410612n14-1" type="given" value="ELIZABETH"/>Elizabeth Bennett</persName>, having been guilty of the most heinous Crime of Murder, the dreadful Nature and Consequence of that Sin, was more particularly expatiated upon, that she might be brought to a due Sense thereof; the Barbarity, Cruelty and Inhumanity of it was exposed, it being a Crime against the express Commandments of God, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt do no Murder, Whosoever sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed, GEN. 9, 6 As God made Man after his own Image, how presumptious! how daring! is it in Man to destroy the Image of the True and Living God, and yet expect to pass unpunish'd; 'twas likewise explained to her that if there could be an Aggravation of that heinous Crime of Murder, 'twas in her Case, to murder in so cruel and barbarous a Manner, her own innocent Child.</p>
            <p>A Crime of such a Nature, that the Lord, by the Mouth of his holy Prophet, Isaiah, proposeth as a Singular Care, as if it were impossible such a Thing could happen, " Can a " Woman (says he) forget her Sucking Child? That she should not have Compassion on the Son of her Womb? Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. Behold I have graven thee upon the Palms of my Hands, thy Walls are continually before me. Isa. 49, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>In her appear'd a Brutallity and Savageness of Mind, contrary to the Nature of the tender Sex, who are known to be more fond, more sympathizing and more compassionate, towards their innocent Babes, than are the Men. But she, more savage than the Brutes, suffocated her Infant, the Instant it was brought into the Light of the World.</p>
            <p>They were instructed in the Nature and End of the Sacrament of our Lord's last Supper, from these Texts, " And they continued stedfastly in</p>

            <p>the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers, Acts ii. 42. Blessed are they which are called unto the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, Rev. xix. 9.</p>
            <p>When these, and many other Admonitions were given, they attended in Chapel, complied with the Prayers, and were attentive to Exhortations. Lupton was ignorant, and could not read, but quiet and decent in his Behaviour; and part of the Time was very sick and weak. <persName id="OA17410612n19-1">

A Master and Mistress of his, with some others, coming one Day to visit him, expressed a very great Sympathy with his Misfortunes; so that he and all of them wept most bitterly, and show'd a very tender Concern; they gave him a very good Character for his Honesty.

In the preceding Part of his Life he was honest, did not steal nor thieve, and kept in his Master's Service, till taken up for this Robbery, which was the first and last he ever committed, which he freely confessed; and when Piggot or Horton denied it, he reproved him for lying, upon which Horton also confessed the same, and both of them own'd they decoy'd Corner into the Fields, after they had been drinking, and that they robb'd him, as was sworn against them, and disposed of the Goods, which were afterwards restored to the proper Owner. He had been but a few Days acquainted with Piggot, who brought the simple, young Lad into this dismal Scrape, and by Consequence hurried him into speedy Destruction; but Justice instantly overtook them, brought them to a fatal End, and prevented much Mischief, which in all Probability they might have done, if suffered to go on in such a</p>

            <p>Although he was Guilty of both these Burglaries, yet for want of clear Evidence, he was Acquitted.</p>
            <p>Some shore Time after this, a certain Person meeting him in the Street, said, I have lost a deal of Money by you, by the two last Prosecutions, and I will certainly take you up again to repair my Losses.</p>
            <p>He knew Lupton to be concerned in a great Number of Burglaries, having had certain Information thereof, and accordingly was as good as his Word, and apprehended him for this capital Crime, upon which he was convicted, and thereby brought to condign Punishment.</p>
            <p>He was a very wicked, naughty, incorrigible Boy, and could neither read, nor write, scarce remembered any thing that was good. He mourned over his Ignorance and most vicious Life; declared his firm Resolution, in Case of Life, to do better, and live as becomes a Christian, and was very desirous to be in Company with one of the others, who could read to him, and pray for him.</p>
            <p>Thus he confessed his very great Wickedness and most deserved Sufferings, and that his Punishment was much less than what he deserved. He was penitent for his very scandalous and impious short Life, was very ignorant of Religion, and all religious Principles. I endeavoured to instruct him, but the Time was short, his Prejudices Great, and his Corruptions were too much confirmed.</p>
            <p>For above one Half of the Time they were under Sentence he constantly came to Chapel, but could scarce say any more than Amen, otherwise he behaved quietly and decently; at last he fell very sick and infirm, and when I visited him in the Cell, he could scarce speak one Word, yet was desirous of Prayers, and loved Admonitions, and when eased of his Irons, made a Shift to come up to Chapel, although in great Weakness, and supported by Johnson, one of his Fellow-Sufferers.</p>

            <p>Upon searching him one Day while he lived with Mr. Wenman, six or seven Guineas was found in his Breeches Pocket, his Mother at the same Time happening to be there, and said the Money was hers; the Boy replied, and said, it was not hers, for he had just receiv'd it of a Person whom his Father had given him Orders to go and receive it. Since his Condemnation, Mr. Wenman and his Wife went to see him, and as soon as he saw them, he fell on his Knees and cry'd, and begg'd they would forgive him, confessing that those Guineas which were found in his Pocket was their Money; and likewise confessed that he and the Bar-keeper was jointly concern'd in robbing them of several Sums of Money at Times. When his</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174106120012"/>
            <p>Master and Mistress talk'd to him, he seemed very much concern'd for his Misfortunes, and pray'd again for them to forgive him, and wish'd he had taken his Mistress's Advice; if he had, he had never brought himself to this miserable End. His Master and Mistress relieved and comforted him all they could, and defired him to prepare himself for Death; that he had join'd himself with such a Knot of Villains, that he could not expect any mercy from above, and at the same Time Mr. Wenman told him, that he had been so great an Offender (although so young) that he could not interceed for him in any shape whatsoever, and that he readily forgave him the Injury he had done to him, and desir'd him once more to prepare himself for Death, and not flatter myself with any Hopes of a Pardon, which I am inform'd your Mother flatters you with. What gave him the greater Opportunity to rob Mr. Wenman, while he was in his Service, was, that he kept two Houses, he having not left that on London-Bridge. He was told by a Clergyman, who was so kind to come to pray by him, that what he had to reveal to the World of any Consequence, if he did not do it, it would be a very great Sin, committed both to God and Man; and on the contrary, to declare what he thought would be of Service; the Laws of God obliged him to do it, because it would be of service to the World, and likewise an Acknowledgment to God of his Sins, and might give a Turn to other persons, who might probably be reclaimed by reading of this, that otherwise might have gone the same Way. Let me therefore persuade all persons, both young and old, to let this my unhappy Chance of Life be an Example to all those who shall read this paper, especially the young Woman who was Fellow Servant at Mr. Wenman's, and was concerned with me, in robbing of him, at several Times.</p>

            <p>" MY Soul has laboured under no small Uneasiness, since I have seen you, least " you should not be sensible of that Matter of " infinite eternal Importance, the Salvation of " your Soul; and as the Time draws nigh, " nay, is at Hand, wherein you must launch into an Eternity either of Misery or Happiness.</p>
            <p>" Oh! arise therefore, and be indeed concern'd about it; it is not, indeed it is not, " now too late; you may now find Salvation for your Soul in this last Hour, tho' you " have never done any Good in all your Life: " but cry unto the Lord Jesus from the Bottom of your Soul, as an undone lost Creature, and he will give you Repentance unto " Life; he will, nay he has forgiven you all " your Iniquities, and make you eternally happy with him: He will give you his Salvation " for nothing, without Money, and without " Price: Ask and it shall be given, knock and " it shall be open'd unto you: This, he who " cannot lie, hath promis'd unto you, and if " you believe it, it shall be performed. He " has confirm'd it by his Oath, which cannot be broken. Our Lord himself saith, " Heaven and Earth may pass away, but not " one Tittle of his Word shall fall to the " Ground.</p>
            <p>" It remains only then, if you feel and know " in what a miserable Condition your Soul</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174106120018"/>
            <p>" lies under through Sin and Iniquity, a Captive and Slave of Sin and Satan, in spiritual " Darkness and Blindness, alienated from God, " nay, full of Hatred and Enmity against " him, and every Thing that is evil, which " you will find described by St. Paul in the " 3 first Chapters of the Epistle to the Romans; scuh indeed we are all by Nature. " If you do not find this, you must cry " without ceasing unto our Saviour, untill he " makes it manifest unto you by his Light " and Holy Spirit, for by Nature we are dead " in Trespasses and Sins, and know not our " wretched, undone Condition, and consequently cannot desire after a Saviour. As " a Man who has a mortal Wound about " him, if he knows it not, nor feels it, we " can never suppose, that he will ever seek " for a Physician for his Cure; so is it with " our Souls. We are fallen from GOD by " the Transgression of our Father Adam, in " all Unhappiness of Sin and Misery, and " know it not till our Saviour stirs us up, and " awakes us out of our Sleep, and shews us " our lost Condition by Nature, and that we " are in Need of a Saviour.</p>
            <p>" He it is who gives Sight to the Blind, and " the Dead, Life, and cures the Diseased; this " was his Work when on Earth, and is yet so " now to this Day by his Spirit. Pray unto " him for this from the Bottom of your Soul, " and it will be given, then you will hunger " and thirst after him, that has shed his Blood " for you on the Cross, and died for you, that " you might not die eternally. But when " our Saviour shall answer your Prayer, and " shew you, that you are nothing but Sin " throughout your Soul, be not frighten'd at " yourself, nor run away from our Saviour; " but fall on your Knees, and thank and praise " him for it, and esteem it as the greatest Blessing that can ever befall you. Then give " yourself over to him, and trust him with " your Soul; believe that you are his, the Purchase of his Blood, the Reward of his Sufferings, dare tell you are a Sinner; and that " it is such, that he is come to seek and to " save. It is not the whole that need Physician, but the sick; when he sees you thus " coming and creeping towards him, it will not " be long e'er his Heart of Love will break " over you, and he will fill your Soul with that " Peace which passeth all Understanding. You " have nothing to do but to believe against all " your Reason, that he has done enough for " you, that he has satisfied for all your Sins, " and reconciled you to GOD. This is what " will give your Heart a solid eace; and if " you doubt not, will To-morrow give you " a safe Passage thro' the Gates of Death, and " waft you to the Bosom of your dear dying " Redeemer. This is his Gift which he will " give you; intreat him that he would let you " feel the Power and Virtue of his Death and " Sufferings in your Heart; that you may feel " Sweetness of his Blood, and find Life and " Salvation therein, before you go hence and " are no more seen; that you yet may be his " living Witness that it is true. O! my dear " Soul, hold fast by this Truth, that he has " died for you; that it is at the Expence of " all his Blood that you are Redeem'd. Cast " your Soul on this, and it will not, no it will " not fail you; lose your Soul in this, and " you shall find it unto eternal Life. O! " what can I say more, Believe, Believe, and " you shall not perish but have everlasting Life. " The Lord Jesus Christ give you a spiritual " Insight and Understanding of what I have " written, that you may feelingly know the " Things that make for your everlasting Peace. " Amen, Amen, Farewel, and think of</p>
            <p>Your truely sincere Friend,</p>
            <p>J. OKELY.</p>
            <p>" P. S. If it be possible, I beg you wou'd " write to me, and let me know how it is " with your Soul before you go to die. Direct " for me at the Golden-Cup in Round-Court, " St. Martin's-le-Grand. If you cannot write, " get somebody else for you. O, I love you! " and shall continually think of you.</p>

            <p>The following LETTER was sent to Mr. BAKER, the <rs id="OA17410612-occupation-26" type="occupation">Attorney</rs>

                     targets="OA17410612n47-1 OA17410612-occupation-26"/>, who was repriev'd the Night before Execution.</p>
            <p>St. M - s-G-t, June 5, 1741.</p>
            <p>' I Have, my dear Friend, endeavour'd ' to see you, but cannot prevail with ' the Gentleman to admit me, by Reason ' the Dead Warrant is come down for ' your Execution on Friday next; and ' therefore I take this Opportunity to ' commune with you, though absent in ' Person.</p>
            <p>' As to your Body, I have nothing to ' say, only, were it the Pleasure of the ' wise Disposer of all Events, to pass the ' bitter Cup! His Will be done.</p>
            <p>' I know, and am unwilling to repeat ' the inexpressible Grief you labour under, from the Aspersions that may be ' cast on your unblemish'd Family! but ' dissipate such Cares, as too low for a Person steping into Eternity; it must be a ' Son of a lower Class of censorious Illnature, that will assume to reproach your ' surviving Friends, with the Miscarriage ' of any Branch of so worthy a Family. ' For no Man is his own Keeper, and it ' highly becomes the strongest, to take ' Care least they fall, and every good ' Man knows he has nothing to attribute ' to himself, what ever Good he has done, ' and it is only the restraining Grace of ' God, that keeps us from the blackest ' Enormities. For sure it is, there is no ' Difference (by Nature) between the most ' publick Sinner, and the strictest (unawaken'd) Moralist.</p>
            <p>' You know by Nature, we are all born ' the Children of Wrath, and therefore ' every Man must be made Regenerate, ' by the quickening Power of God, and ' his Holy Spirit, e'er he can be a Partaker with the Inheritors of Grace, and ' have an humble, confident, assuring ' Earnest of the Promise of Life, e'er he ' go away, and be no more seen.</p>
            <p>' This! This! my dear Friend, is the ' great Errand for which we all came into the World, it mattereth not what ' we have been, but what we now are; ' 'tis vain to premeditate longer on our ' Sins and Follies, when we can faithfully ' see a Mediator.</p>
            <p>' There is not that Sin committed since ' Adam, for which Christ hath not dy'd, ' and all we have to do to be Partakers ' of the Efficacy of his Death, is to believe in him with a lively, firm, humble ' (yet assuring Faith) that we find an ' Application of his Blood, sufficient to ' cleanse us from all our Iniquities. This ' indeed is the Balm of Gilliard. This! ' This! alone cures all Diseases of Men ' amongst us, and is free for all who will ' believe on the Donor. With him no ' Time is excepted, no Place excluded, or ' Circumstances exempted; his Love and ' Glory shone on St. Paul in the Prison, ' and his consolating Dove visits the darkest Cell as well as the Altar. No sooner we fell the Want of a Physician, but ' lo! He! the good Samaritan, pours in ' the Oil; no sooner are we determin'd ' to arise and fly to him for Refuge; but</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174106120020"/>
            <p>' behold we are in his Arms, and his Love ' embraces us; then will he cloth us with ' the Garment of his Righteousness, and ' adorn us with a Ring of Eternity.</p>
            <p>' Oh! my dearest Friend! I rejoice with ' you inasmuch as I hope God hath visited ' you in the Day of Calamity, with the ' consolating Spirit of the afflicteds Comforter: Consider my dear Brother, ' Christ came into the World only to ' cure the broken Hearted; the Motives ' that open'd our Eyes, and brought us to ' Contrition availeth not. It may be, ' God saw the hardness of your Heart, ' and permitted the Dissolution of the ' Body for the Advancement of your ' Soul.</p>
            <p>' If you suffer an ignominious Death ' innocently? How much more did our ' dear Redeemer suffer; he in who was ' no Fault, neither was guilt found in his ' Lips, suffer'd for our Transgressions; ' he was abased, that we might be exalted.</p>
            <p>Oh! infinite and boundless Love! thy ' precious Blood was spilt for all without ' exemption; even the last Moments does ' he accept, though like the Thief on ' the Cross, we deride and re-crucifie during our whole Lives; yet if in the ' last Moments we believe in our Hearts, ' and confess him with our Mouths, we ' shall sit with him in the Paradiscal Mansions of his Father, and Triumphant ' over Death and Sin; singing endless ' Praises and Hallelujah's with the mighty ' Hosts of Heaven.</p>
            <p>' Oh! my dearest Friend! here is the ' Heaven of Rest, and happy is the Man ' that gets to this Port first. What signifies in what Manner we leave the World, 'it's highest Honours, Riches or Pleasure, ' are but fleeting and transitory? The ' spiritual Man disregards it's highest ' Objects, as meer Toys, Feathers, or ' Bladders of Water blown in the Air, ' which when broke, vanish and are forgotten. But he that feels Christ form'd ' in his Soul (as the Apostle says) is in ' fulness of Riches, and his Pleasure is ' past expressing.</p>
            <p>' In the present unhappy Situation of ' Circumstances, I cannot have the Pleasure of conversing with you, which if ' you are very desirous let me know, ' and I'll omit no Endeavours ' till I get ' Permission; but in the mean Time, ' if your Constitution will any Way ' permit, let me have a Letter from you ' that I may know how you feel your ' Heart; that haply God might make me ' instrumental to administer Comfort.</p>
            <p>' I am also concern'd for the Welfare ' of your Body, which if in any shape I ' can be serviceable, lay your Commands ' on your old Friend; but I hope you ' have an unerring Adviser and Consolator, for what Man can do is nothing; ' therefore I recommend you to the Father of the Afflicted, who heareth the ' Sighs of the Contrite, and putteth their ' Tears in a Bottle; and I hope he will ' have Compassion on you, and your loving ' sympathizing Friend.</p>
