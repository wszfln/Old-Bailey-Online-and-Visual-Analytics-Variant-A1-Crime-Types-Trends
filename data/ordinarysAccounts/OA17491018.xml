            <p>My DEAR,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174910180006"/>
            <p>THese few Lines come to acquaint you of my good Health, and good Heart, both ready and willing to die, and to leave a World not worth thinking of. I have done my best to make myPeace with God, and so shall continue to do, till my Soul takes its Flight to the highest Heavens above, where is no Sorrow nor Trouble, but all Joys for evermore. My Dear, you are all the Thoughts and Care I have in this World, and that you would for sake all your Sins, and repent of them in Time while God offereth his Mercy, is what I desire. For it is a sad thing to be plung'd into Eternity not to be prepared for it. I wish, as you love your Soul, that you would take care of it, and let these Lines take Place in your Heart. My Dear, it is my Duty to leave this Charge with you, which I hope you will accept as kindly and as willingly as I send it you. Don't think of or mind my Misfortune, for it is no more than I justly deserve from God; because I wanted not for Knowledge of Good, but always did Evil against the Laws of the Almighty. However, my Dear, there is a great Comfort left me, and that is, I am not guilty of what the Man swore against me. God forgive him for it, and I hope he will not lay it to his Charge; for as I hope for Forgiveness from God, I forgive him.</p>
            <p>'Twas God that thus suffered me to be punished for my former wicked and vile Doings, to be an Example for offending the just and good God. My Dear, I do think myself happy to die in an innocent Cause; for God is a righteous Judge, who will not condemn the Innocent; and for losing my Life now, I hope to have Life everlasting. Remember me to all enquiring Friends, and as I know, my Dear, you can't provide or help my Body to be buried, never trouble yourself about it. So I have no more to say, but the Blessing of God attend you, and keep you for ever. My Dear, I am no more concern'd for my Death, than if I was to live. My Dear, these are the last Lines from your dying Husband, <persName id="OA17491018n35-1">

            <p>He associated with Hazard, he says, upwards of a Fortnight, before he knew he was given to Thieving and Robbery. He was concern'd in many Robberies with Hazard, Cavenagh, and others: Hazard brought him acquainted with Cavenagh, and when Hazard stay'd at Home with his Wife, as he would do sometimes, then he went upon the Patrole with Cavenagh.

He never went with them, he says, to sell what Prizes they got; and out of the Whole, he declares, he never had above two Guineas. He was a poor, ignorant, unhappy Man, no doubt led astray by the other two, who were long us'd to these wicked Practices; and what we may call, in their own cant Term, very knowing; having been the Instrument of bringing others to Ruin before him, as themselves have declared before Execution.</p>
            <p>Of this Robbery, for which they are convicted, Mynott was guilty; for he took the Man by the Mouth, after Hazard had robb'd him of his Watch, threaten'd him, and forbid him to call out; and Cavenagh turning out his Pockets, took from him three Half-pence, and a Thimble. He was a surly sullen Mortal, with Difficulty perswaded to do any Thing towards working out his Salvation; but at last, did put himself to the Pains of saying, he hop'd God would have Mercy on his Soul.</p>

However, Robinson owns the Fact, and says, he was drunk when he did what he suffers for, and hopes God will forgive him, for that he never did any Mischief to any one; and had not Necessity so urgentlypress'd him, and evil Advice over-persuaded him, he never should have been brought into this Scrape, for his own Thoughts would scarce have prompted him to it.</p>

This however Boyde denyed, as also that he ever knew of any Peoples coming to his House, who were addicted to Robbery, or Thieving. Let this be as it will, I can't pretend to determine the Case; but, when this Fact was committed, for which he suffers, Neway, who was robb'd, was directed to go to Boyd's House to see for those who had robbed him; where he found Boyd, and Dumpsey, who was acquitted. Dumpsey the Prosecutor cou'd not positively Swear to, but Boyd he did; and moreover that Boyd staid and beat him, after the rest were run away, which they did upon his crying out Murder, and a Coach passing by at the same Time, they were afraid of being taken.</p>

            <p>The Prosecutor is very positive as to him, and deposed, that when the House was surrounded, Boyd look'd out of the Window; when they knock'd at the Door, Boyd with a Stick in his Hand came and opened it, which Stick was produced in Court. Besides Boyd opposed the Prosecutor, as he was going up Stairs, and endeavour'd to keep himdown, that he might not be discovered, by darting an Iron Spindle at him; yet the People followed him up Stairs, and Boyd flying to the Garret, was taken there, and being had before a Magistrate was committed. These Circumstances I mentioned to him the Morning of Execution, as I had done indeed several Times before, but he persisted in denying the Fact, and did so to the last, tho' he was admonished to consider, that to dye with a falsity in his Mouth at the last Moment, might be of worse Consequence to him, than any Wickedness he might before have committed.</p>

He went from his Parents however about that Time, and the Sea seemed to suit his Temper best, whose inconstant Waves he chose rather to trust himself with, than to tarry any longer at Home. Being a well made, useful Man, in the several Ships he was taken Notice of by some Commanders, and made an <rs id="OA17491018-occupation-33" type="occupation">Inferior Officer</rs>

When he came on Shore, he had 45 l. to receive for Wages, which he did receive, besides 270 l. he says, for Prize Money he has received in that Time, all which he has squandred away in loose disorderly Company. Thus far he was explicit, but nothing more particular did he chose to add, except with respect to the Robbery, for which he suffered.</p>
            <p>He always protested Innocence, and said as to Lillwall the Prosecutor, he never saw him in his Life, till he came and fixt the Robbery upon him. And as to Jones, to whom the Prosecutor told the Story, and who by Enquiry after Alford, found his Place of Abode, and directed the Prosecutor where to go; he always declared, that he never saw the Man in his Life, unless he met him in the Streets, as he might do any Body, without knowing, or taking any Notice of him. That he had been a loose, idle, and extravagant young Fellow, he did own, but not a Word of any Robbery. His Countenance was always the same, steady to the last, and the above Declaration he persisted in. He seemed to meet his Fate with Patience and Resolution, not at all unbecoming a Man, especially if he knew himself not guilty of the Fact, had Hope towards God, and trust in the Merits of his Saviour.</p>

Whom when he laid hold of Mynott, he threatned with his Life, if he did not let him go, and accordingly snapt his Pistol at him, as he did at another Person, who actually laid hold of him, and took him.

I forgive all my Enemies, as I hope to be forgiven. This to the best of my Remembrance is the Truth, and nothing but the Truth.</p>

            I hope the Lord will have Mercy on my Soul.</p>
            <p>There was a Circumstance started a Day or two before Execution, which carried a bad Face with it, and which no doubt, was a great Means of preventing Mercy's being extended towards him; which is, that when he was taken, there was a Bundle of Linen found upon him, tyed up in a Handkerchief. When this came to Light, 'twas thought necessary to ask him particularly as to this Fact. To this, his Reply to me and others was, that it was true, he had such a Bundle, but how he came by it, he did not remember, nor could he recollect, whether himself tied it up, or any Body else; but that he has been told since by some of his Friends, that a Woman there present, was seen to have it in her Hand. But, she thought proper to drop it, and then he took it up, not knowing what was contained in the Handkerchief, nor yet whose Property it might be.</p>

            , we give them a Place in this Account, as they suitably express the grateful Sentiments of his Heart on that important Occasion.</p>
            <p>I.</p>
            <p>AND live I yet by Power Divine? And have I still my Course to run? Again brought back in its Decline, The Shadow of my parting Sun?</p>
            <p>II.</p>
            <p>Wond'ring I ask, is this the Breast Struggling so late, with Grief and Pain, The Eyes that upwards look'd for Rest, And dropt their weary Lids again?</p>
            <p>III.</p>
            <p>The recent Horrors still appear, Oh! may they never cease to awe! Still be the King of Terrors near, Whom late in all his Pomp I saw.</p>
            <p>IV.</p>
            <p>Torture and Grief prepar'd his Way, And pointed to a yawning Tomb, Darkness behind eclipted the Day. And check'd my forward Hopes of Heaven.</p>
            <p>V.</p>
            <p>But now the dreadful Storm is o'er, Ended at last the doubtful Strife, And living, I the Hand adore, That gave me back again my Life.</p>
            <p>VI.</p>
            <p>God of my Life, what just Return Can sinful Dull and Ashes give; I only live my Sins to mourn, To love my God I only live.</p>
            <p>VII.</p>
            <p>To thee, benign and sacred Pow'r, I consecrate my lengthen'd Days, While mark'd with Blessings ev'ry Hour Shall speak thy co-extended Praise.</p>
