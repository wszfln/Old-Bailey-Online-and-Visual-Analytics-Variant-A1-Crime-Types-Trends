She lost her husband and two children, which were all she ever had; and growing old, and not able to provide for herself, in the hard winter 1739, she was put into the work-house.</p>
            <p>There she remained ever since, and was appointed to look after the boys, to keep them to work, and see that they did not behave contrary to the rules of the house. But, being not much used to children, who are apt to be unlucky, where there is not that authority over them, which ought to be, they would often play tricks with the old woman. And she, being very ignorant, and of a peevish temper, was too much accustomed to beat the poor children; this usage made them not very fond of her, and the more inclined to teize her. Words to this purpose she made use of in telling the history of her behaviour in the work-house; while the short time lasted she had to live after conviction.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175511120005"/>
            <p>She was (for a person of her age) as ignorant as can well be supposed, nay was scarce escaped from being an ideot, as unfit to have management of children, as to tame lions. However, when she could be brought to understand questions put to her, she always declared she had, no thought of murdering the boy; when she began to beat him, she did not think to hurt him, but believed she was hurried on by the devil and passion to the unmerciful deed, for which she was inclined to own the justice of her suffering. But as she was entirely illiterate, and had never been much used in any part of her many years to the hearing of instruction, of religion or its duties, time would not permitto give her much insight into these things; only that the hopes of such a heinious transgressor, both against God and nature, depended wholly on the mercy of God, and the merits of his Son, who came into the world to redeem the sinner, who confesses his unworthiness upon account of sin, and repents, that his sin may be blotted out; and she died in some sense of hope after death.</p>

            There he lived, as he said, in reputation for a while, and had his share of business for a young beginner. But not having a capital sufficient to support what he had undertaken, he was obliged, after a few months, to quit this house and shop; and having married a too near relation, with whom he did not upon reflection choose to live, he went about from place to place, to keep himself from her; so that he had no settled habitation, nor staid long in any one lodging.</p>
            <p>Being now in no constant business, and only depending on now and then an accidental patient, a way was opened for misspending his time; and what he got by chance in his profession, afforded but slender maintenance. Thus he began to give way to loose and idle company, of which that neighbourhood is seldom, or ever destitute; and he was at last tempted to fall into the share of those, who encourage themselves in mischief, and commune among themselves, how they may lay snares; who imagine mischief, and practice it.</p>
            <p>It was about eight years ago, he said, since he came first to <placeName id="OA17551112-geo-17">

He declared always, and to the last, that he never was guilty of any robbery before, nor burglary, till this; and how he came to do this, he related in the following manner, and, as a dying man, declared to be the truth, viz. He said, that at a place where he had lodgings, a livery servant of the prosecutor's lodged also. They were frequently together, and the servant as often repeated to him how easy a matter it was to get into his master's house by night, and take away any thing that was to be met with. He described the weak part of the house which was to be broken so minutely, as to be very easily understood, and recommended it to Dipple to make the attempt; but, Dipple says, he for a long time had no thought of putting it in practice, till his necessities pressing him sorely, he resolved upon it, and chose the unfortunate 24th of July last for the purpose. On that fatal night he took his instruments of wicked device in his pocket, and easily forced</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175511120007"/>
            <p>his entrance into the house by means of a tap-borer, which he forced through the door just where he supposed the handles of the bolts were in each door, and then pushed them back with his finger. He went in unheard, and by means of his dark lanthorn found the goods with which he was charged, and carried them off (a heavy load) by himself.

He was a good workman while he was at it, which caused his master the rather to bear with his irregularities, which he could not help at times to run into, which brought on him the frequent chidings of his master.</p>
            <p>About Easter last was twelvemonth he had been keeping holiday, he says, and staid out very late; when he came home, he says, he knocked at his master's door, but he told him to go where he had been so long absent, for he should not come in there. Benson went away for that time, and when his master and he met again, they mutually agreed to part.</p>
            <p>Benson says he began now to be weary of work, his mind, greatly inclined to idleness, having for some time past been used to company that he liked (though in itself detestable) being idle and dissolute persons, which led him on by degrees to his ruin.</p>

            <p>He says his father endeavoured by all the persuasions he could think of to make him think better of the matter, and that in pursuanceof his father's advice, he did set down to work, and by degrees learned his trade. But as soon as he had got a little money, he played the loose, and ran away to his companions, and when he had squadered away what he had got by working, he returned to his father, to work and get more for the same purpose. Thus he went on after he had left his master, frequently getting into broils, and perils, thro' quarrelling, when he was drunk. He seemed to be of a resolute daring temper, was a very strong, thick set youthy, and very fit for the business he was first put out to; had he but had the grace to have remained, where he might, he owns, have done very well.</p>
            <p>He left his father's business also, for the sake of that company, which drove him on to ruin, and hurried his desperate inclination into any wickedness that might be committed. He lodged, where were none but the worst sort of people, of both sexes, and there became acquainted with

            <p>This woman, and he lived together, and did much mischief during their acquaintance, there's reason to believe. For, he says, she excited him to do more than ever his own inclination led him to, bent upon evil as it was; and that he wanted to part with her many times, but could not tell how, after he had once engaged with her, she followed him so close. He says, they had done many bad things together, which he was sorry for, and hoped God would forgive him.</p>
            <p>He pretended, that particular facts had slipped his memory, and owned only one, besides what he was committed for; and that was, that he picked a person's pocket, who sat by him at an ale-house, of a tobacco-box, and other things, which, he says, he should not have thought of, had not the woman put him upon it.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175511120009"/>
            <p>The robbery for which he was convicted, he acknowledges, and says also, that the woman put him upon it; tho', as he owns also, they went out for the purpose of committing a robbery, on whomsoever it might happen, nor was his inclination wanting. And a most impudent, and daring attempt it was, but a very little way from his own lodgings, and upon a person whom he knew, and to whom he was very well known. And, as if the fellow was infatuated, he, with the woman, appearedpublickly on the very spot, where the person robbed must pass almost every time he went out of his house. And upon the spot was he taken, not many hours after he had committed the robbery, by the prosecutor himself, and was committed to Newgate.</p>
            <p>He made no defence upon trial; and after conviction behav'd, when I saw him well, to appearance, tho' naturally hardened; and impudent, would sometimes force a tear. He received instructions with attention, and seeming willingness; what impression it made on him God only knows; we hope for the best.</p>

            <p>What wrought his ruin was, the company he fell into, when a drummer; and shocking delusion from the most abandoned, and unnatural crew of wretches, that ever the world knew, called Sodomites, first led him into that damnable violation of all laws, natural, civil, and religious.</p>

Being thus taken in among them, he lost all thoughts of God, and religion; he had no regard to any duty, but that he was obliged to in the army, and the fear of military discipline kept him close to that.</p>
            <p>He had many presents made him, and he was thereby enabled to go pretty smart when out of his regimentals, which was admired at by some of his comrades, that knew he had not relations that could afford him any great assistance. And, he acknowledges, that all he had besides his pay arose from the advantages which he received from those worse than brutes, whom St. Paul has complimented with the name of men, who leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one towards another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. And thus does he condemn their practice, having finally provoked God to forsake them. The wrath of God is revealed against all ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness. For who hold the truth in uprighteousness more than they, whose natural convictions of their own mind are kept down under the dominion and power of their corruptions; who invert the order of nature, or rather of the God of nature, and are more brutish, than the very brutes!</p>
            <p>You may remember, there was a paragraph in the papers sometime since, with regard to a nest of these unnaturals being discovered by a vigilant magistrate, in a little room behind a barber's shop, the place where not particularly described. As we talked about these disagreeable things, he told me once, that he verily believed he knew the house, tho' he never was in it, but was acquainted with some who resorted to a house under that denomination. In short, he was known to, and knew, great numbers of these cattle, and has given the names of several, some who have been stigmatized, and some not. Their places of abode he has marked from Newington in Surry, to Windsor in Berkshire, and from Chelsea to Whitechapel in Middlesex.</p>

            <p>The laws have provided proper punishment for this most enormouscrime; but scarce any one but knows, how difficult it is to come at the perpetrators of it, so as to fix it upon them. These works of darkness are inveloped with such a thick cloud as is scarce ever to be seen through, which is the only reason they escape justice here; but he that sees through all the universe will surely punish them for these things.</p>
            <p>This unfortunate youth, who laid open the way to these short observations, declared himself much more affected with sorrow, for that he had been among so vile a set of wretches, than that he was to suffer death for the robbery. He acknowledges the taking the watch from the prosecutor, the sending another person to receive the money, as the advertisement directed, and going after for the remaining part, which the other had not brought, and upon the whole acknowledges the justice of his suffering. He thanked God, who had thus afflicted him, and given him time to repent; and generally when we conversed he wept very bitterly.</p>
            <p>But as to the two letters, threatning the prosecutor to lay an information, he utterly denies having any farther knowledge than that, after he was committed, the two letters were shewed to him, but he neither wrote nor read them; and he believes they were contrived, and sent by the other two soldiers.</p>
            <p>The sense he now had of the heinousness of this, and all those abominable acts he had been concerned in, since God had been pleased to suffer him to be in trouble, which brought him to reflection, and to suffer here, he had hope might meet with favour from God hereafter, for the merits of Christ, in whom he alone trusted.</p>

            <p>We shall therefore charitably report in the negative, as his declaration, ever since convicted, was, that this fact, for which he suffered, was the first of the kind; altho' he could not but acknowledge this to be a most daring attempt, provided it was the first enterprise of the kind. At least we suppose his mind very aptly bent towards such practice, if we consider the circumstances, viz. to dare to fire three pistols; and his cunning appeared in going into the wood in one dress, and coming out in another, to evade the pursuit.</p>
            <p>He was very slow of speech after conviction, tho' none more loquacious before. He entertained great hopes before trial, that the fact might not be so fully proved as to convict him; and after sentence of death also his hopes revived, when he found that his friends had made interest, where he was born, and had obtained a petition in his behalf, signed by almost the whole town of any note. And this kept them alive till within a day or two before he suffered.</p>

            <p>He then began to endeavour to resign to the fate allotted him; and when all hopes were lost, he could force a tear. And tho' his heart trembled for fear of what was to be; yet he sometimes put on the appearance of bravery, which proved itself to be false and affected, by its forsaking hsm at the last. The morning of execution he wept bitterly, and expressed great sorrow, that he had entertained hope of this life so long, to the prejudice of his sincerity in repentance, and the thoughts of hereafter. And, he said, in words to this effect,had he not been buoy'd up by his friends with false hopes he should have been more inclined to search after that hope, which fadeth not; and that happiness which is purchased by Christ for him, who is of a true penitent heart, and contrite spirit; who really and truly believeth in God, and heartily desires to be saved.</p>
