            <p>Together with their LAST Dying WORDS Before their Execution at <placeName id="OA16850506A-geo-2">TYBURN</placeName>.</p>
            <p>IT is very deplorable, That after frequent and publick Examples of Justice upon Malefactors, there should be such a confluence of obdurate Criminals condemned at the Sessions in the <placeName id="OA16850506A-geo-3">Old-Bayly</placeName>, held on Wednesday,Thursday 29,30 April, as also on Friday May 1. last past, there being then 23 persons sentenced to Death, for Notorious Crimes, some of which would not take warning, though they had received sparing mercy before.</p>
            <p>Thus that Character which the Prophet Isaiah mentions, is verified in these Offenders, viz. Let Favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will they not learn Righteousness. Also that of Zephaniah, Chap. 3. ver. 5. Every morning the just Lord brings his judgment to light; he fails not therein, in giving frequent warnings against Sin, yet the unjust know no shame: But whosoever being often reproved, hardens his heart, shall fall into mischief, and that suddenly, Prov. 29. I.</p>
            <p>The Ordinary visited the condemned Prisoners on Saturday, and spent much time with them, to awaken them from their security; and informed them, that the day of their xecution would be speedier than they thought, bescause they prefumed upon the hope of a General Pardon.</p>
            <p>The Ordinary therefore, took the more pains to prepare these Criminals for their death, because he was told, That it would be on Wednesday, and that few of them would escape; exhorting them to consider how sad their condition was, how sinful; and that if they trifled away their precious hours, in not making their Peace with the Supreme Judge; who is a consuming Fire to all obstinate Offenders, they could not but aggravate their sin and eternal misery, by rejecting the remedy of both, in not performing the Duties required of them, in order to a blessed Eternity. The Ordinary, after much exhorting of them, prayed with them,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA16850506A0002"/>
            <p>to make them the more preparcd for the solemn Observation of the Lords day: On which he preacht on the 17th of the Acts of the Apostles, ver. 30, 31. The times of this ignorance God winked at: But now commandeth all men every where-to repent: Because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance to all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</p>
            <p>The Ordinary read Prayers, and preached twice on this Text observing some of them to be very attentive, and seemingly much affected with both his discourses.</p>
            <p>In the Morning Sermon he acquainted them, that the first Clause of that Verse had been much perverted, to an extenuation of Sins of Ignorance, from the mistaking of the Phrase, God winked at the times of Ignorance; but the Word in the Original, doth not import any careless Indulgence of Sins of Ignorance, but is a comparative Speech, signifying, that he did not so strictly animadvert, and, for the present, punish the Idolatry of the Athenians, he did not take sudden present punishment to extremity. Sins of, Ignorance, under the darker dispensation of the Law, were comparatively overlookt, and passed by of God; but under the clear Revelation of the Gospel, to remainignorant jof. God, and of the right way of Salvation, is no excuse nor extenuation of such a wilful neglect of the means of Grace, and the knowledge of God in Christ; but rather indulgeth Sloth and Ignorance, is an aggravation of such sins which properly slow from it: The Apostle St. Paul affirms, That if the Gospel be hid from Sinners by a neglect to know their duty, so that they embrace not the terms and conditions of Salvation, such Sinners remaining wilfully ignorant, are lost as to any wellgrounded hope of future happiness, and cannot escape the last Judgment of God.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon of the Lords day the Ordinary. proceeded to the remaining parts of the Text, viz. That God Now Commands all Mm every where to Repent. Which Phrase doth not so properly signifie an Immediate Repentance without Delay, tho this, may be Included: But is meant of the present clear, and more Urgent Tenders of Gospel Grace and Salvation by Christ: Whence he observed, that the first Covenant of Works being Broken, did not admit of any Repentance, neither could the lapsed Sinner Effect any such frame in himself, so as to satisfie Gods offended Justice. Adams A postacy, tho it did not blot out the knowledge of the Equity of Repentance, yet it had so disinabled him from working any such Disposition in himself, that he had neither any Capacity nor Encouragement thereunto, till the dawning of that Gracious Promise (included inxhe very Doom on the Serpent) That the Seed of the Wowan, Christ Jesus Incarnate, by his Meritorious Death and Passion, which was the Bruising only of the Heel of Christs Humane Nature, should Break the Serpents Head of Subtile malicious Power, against sinful Mankind. This, Promise Melted down the Pride of his Heart, and softned the Hardness of it, inviting him to Repentance. Thus no Sorrow for Sin can be accepted without Respect to Christ's infinite Satisfation, and the Believing Sinners sincere Application thereof.</p>
            <p>The Ordinary Refuted all Objections against Repentance, as if that were unsutable to a Gospel State: then he opened the true Nature of it, Wherein it differs from defective legal Sorrow, in all the Evangelical properties of it: Also having Exhorted the prisoners to obtain it: among many Motives, he made use of such especially as are mentioned in the Text, which would be Tedious to rehearse, and so dismist the Condemned Criminals, till Monday in the Forenoon, when he Visited them again, and having largely Exhorted and Prayed with them, he desired them to give him some account of the their Prepa rations for a Blessed Eternity. Some refused it with greater Obstinacy, than ever any did for nine Years past, as desperate and hardned in Wickedness, presuming they should be Rardoned, or being bold to venture into an Eternal State, without any defire to be Instructed or prepared for it.</p>
            <p>These were observed to be the greatest Criminals, and the most Obdurate, even rejecting all further Counsel, or to give any account how they stood affected with what had before been given with much tenderness and Commiseration.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to give some account of such who Voluntarily offered themselves to be directed by the Ordinary, as unto the better clearing up of their fitness for Death and future Judgment.</p>

He Voluntarily confess'd that he had often broke the Sabbath; that he had been Disobedient to his Parents; that the Devil was very busie with him, to tempt him to other Sins. He denied not the Crime for which he was Condemned, but much lamented with Tears his Manifold Provocations of God, yet hoped, that he had not utterly forsaken him, because that he had made all Sin Now as Odious to him, as at any time it had been Delightful.

He said, because he would not disoblige the Person who promised him Employment, he sought not for any elsewhere, and this brought him into great streights.</p>
            <p>As to the Crime for which he stands Condemned, he affirmed now, as a Dying man, that Roath and Collwood came to his house, and two more with them, Solliciting him to Rob Mr. Henderson a Scotch-Minister, he acknowledges that they all Five walkt out together.

            <p>He said, that he had perished Eternally, if God had not forced him to Humiliation for spent Life, by this severe but Righteous dipentation; for he had been an old and greatmer, and could not have any hope of seeing the Face of God, but by Christs Satisfaction; but Oh my wicked Heart, said he, with a y sorrowful interjection, tho I should live the years of Methusalem, and my Humiliation extend as long, yet could it not wash out the tan of the least sin.</p>
            <p>He said he hoped his peace was made with God, because he is freely willing to Dye, the rather, least he should turn to the Folly of Sinning afresh, which would provoke God to Condemne him Eternally.</p>

            <p>Most Holy Lord, Good and Gracious, Everlasting and Blessed God, how Gracions art thou, Lord God, thou art a great God, and a Merciful God, and Thou hast done for me a Thousand times more then I deserved; I confess I Have been a great Sinner, and have done those things I ought not to have done, and left undone what I ought to have done: Lord, help me, strengthen my Faith every Minute more and more, those few Minutes I have to live, that when my Soul and Body parts, my Soul may ascend up to Heaven; and that he that shed his Blood for Sinners, may make my peace with God. Let my Sins be covered, forsake me not because of my Sins; I have been a great Sinner, I have offended against thy Holy Laws, I have humbly confest them all. Lord, for Christ Jesus Sake, forgive me all my Sins; I have confest them upon my bended knees: Grant that I may be a warning to others, that they may Spend their Sabbath better, walk uprightly and justly, and do nothing contrary to God's Law: Lord, receive my everlasting Soul; Jesus, keep me from the torments of Hell. One thing more I beg, Lord, bless the poor Widow that will be by and by, the Lord raise her friends, and give her Grace to undergo this trouble. And now I part in peace, I have repented me of all my Sins, and for Christ Jesus sake enable me with all things necessary this day, concluding this my imperfect Prayer, as Christ himself hath taught me, Our Father, Etc.</p>
