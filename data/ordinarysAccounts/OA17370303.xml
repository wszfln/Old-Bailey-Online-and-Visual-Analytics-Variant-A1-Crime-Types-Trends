            <p>While under Sentence, they were exhorted seriously to think upon the miserable Circumstances they had reduced themselves to, and to reflect upon the great Danger of departing from God and forsaking his Ways, which was the Cause that God had forsaken them and given them up unto themselves, to follow their own Hearts Lusts, and the foolish Imaginations of their own pernicious Counsels, which were the only Occasion of all those Snares and crying Sins into which they had fallen, from whence proceeded all the miserable Calamities they were then subjected to; as in old Times, the Jews, who were then God's peculiar chosen People, had the severe Judgments of Heaven inflicted upon them for the like Sins; as we see from Jer 2 19. Thine own Wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee; know therefore and see, that it is an evil Thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee saith the Lord God of Hosts. It was observed hence, That their wickedness and backslidings from God, were the procuring Cause of severe Judgments befalling them. 2dly, That it was their Duty to consider seriously, what an evil and bitter Thing it is to forsake the Lord our God. And 3dly, That as the want of the Fear of God precipitated Men into the greatest Sins and worst of Evils, therefore it was their Duty to despise this World with the Vanities and Evils thereof, and to study and endeavour, in their few remaining Moments, to attain the fear and love of God, in order to dispose them by the Grace of God, for the Joys of another World. They were instructed in the necessary Articles of our most holy Christian Faith, to know God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent. St. Jo. 17. 3.</p>

Wager and Baker was ask'd, whether they robb'd one Mr. Tonge, a School master? They both reply'd that they knew nothing of it. All the rest of them adher'd to their former Confessions, and added no more, but that they hoped that God would have Mercy upon their Souls.

                        targets="OA17370303n76-1 OA17370303-geo-101"/>Tyburn</placeName> on Wednesday the 4th of June 1735 for robbing Mr. Powers on the Highway, and taking from him a Silver Watch, a Chain and Seal value 3 l. 9 s. May 13, and this unhappy Criminal we are now speaking of, rode in the same Cart to the Execution of his Brother. This  very melancholy Instance of the Depravity  Humane Nature, and a sad Proof, that wh Persons have contracted vicious Habits, and leagu'd themselves with Persons of their own Stamp, no Prospect of a fatal Catastrophe, however near or certain, nor any Examples, however terrible, are able to deter from the Commission of Facts, the Consequence of which must inevitably be Ruin, Misery and Destruction.</p>
            <p>This George, of whom we are speaking, has often been committed to <placeName id="OA17370303-geo-102">
                  <interp inst="OA17370303-geo-102" type="type" value="site"/>

If (continu'd his Adviser) you would shew your self a Man, hire a good Horse, and procure a Pair of good Pistols,-then turn out, and shew your self a brave Fellow. These repeated Instructions, from one under the strongest Ties of Nature to promote and rejoice in his real Interest and Advantage, were no doubt strong Encouragements to him, to proceed from one Crime to another, for the greater the Crime, and the more daring and horrid the Villany, the more likely he was to meet with Commendation and Applause. Thus this kind Adviser of his, has in some Measure been  Cause of his ignominious End.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173703030013"/>
            <p>Unwillingness to take Pains for an honest Support led this Wretch into criminal Courses: Extravagant and exorbitant Expences tempted him, (while a Youth) to commit frequent Robberies, to support his profuse Way and Manner of Living: Neither his own frequent lucky Escapes from Justice, nor the Example of his ther, who was hang'd before his Face, had y Influence on him; but from the Time that  abandon'd himself to an infamous criminal Way of Life, he gave a Loose to his Inclinations, and fouander'd away what he got with  View of plundering for more: Consideration and Reflection were entirely thrown off,  from a harden'd Conscience proceeded his cking and terrifying Audacity.</p>
            <p>Nothing (to use the Malefactor's own Words) ore dangerous to us young Fellows, than  Company of those odious shameless common Wenches, who frequent our Company, and  upon us to partake of our Plunder. These Wretches do all that in them lies to stifle all morse that may happen to arise in our Minds. , in order to gratify their Lusts and satisfy  Extravagance, they excite us to commit imes of the most horrid Nature; and in their pers they are generally much more cruel  bloody than Men. Their Advice is, alys, to make sure Work, to act safely, and ent Tales from being told, and to kill if we  pursu'd. They always partake with us in  Debauches; they get drunk as well as we,  are common to the whole Gang; yet, if  can get any thing by it, they will be the  that discover and betray us. And in this spect our Male Companions are pretty much  our Females, for oftentimes, even when  are eating, drinking and carousing together  hearty Friends, we are contriving and designing to betray and hang one another.</p>
            <p>This unhappy Wretch declared, that he could  leave the World without giving an Account of the Life he had led for many Years, with  rest of his Brethren. Although (says he)  are generally to corrupted from our Childhood that we have no Sense of Duty to God  Man, nor the least Regard to Virtue, Honour or Honesty; yet we always have a Hea on our Spirits, and are never without certain painful Apprehensions, which hang upon our Minds so constantly, that we never can enjoy any Ease or Quiet, till we have thoroughly heated our selves with Liquor, and till we are (what we call half Seas over) with Who and Confederates; nor can we sleep sound, unless we reel to Bed. If we go abroad in the Day-time, honest Men may easily know us to be Rogues by our Faces; and our suspicions fearful Countenances are sufficient at any Time to discover us. I have known a Brother Thief by his Looks, by his often turning back, and his sculking thro' narrow Lanes and Alleys, tho' I have not been acquainted with him. When we have gotten a Booty, we divide it equally among our Companions and Mistresses, for every one of us has a Wench, that he calls his own; but when we have a Mind for Variety, we change them among our selves, and they are common to us all. We have particular Houses that entertain and harbour us, and in Cases of Difficulty, or when we apprehend Danger, in these Houses we are conceal'd; and by way of Recompence to the Master or Mistress of the House, we always allow them a Snack in our Gains; and they knowing our Manner of Life, make us pay treble the Value of every Thing we have of them. We have Receivers in all Parts of the Town for the Pla Watches, Rings, Snuff-Boxes, &amp;c. which we steal; but these People seldom give us above a third Part of the Value of the Goods. I have seen a Tankard worth 15 Pounds sold for Five Guineas; and a Gold Watch of the Value of 12 Guineas, sold for Four. This is a true Account of the Life I have led: A Life more miserable than that of the poorest Labourer, who toils for 4 d. a Day; yet such is the Force of Habit, that tho' I am sensible of all this, yet sure I am, if I was set immediately at Liberty, or could make my Escape from the Gallows, I should not be able to refrain from the same Courses, but should instantly return to my old Way of Life again.</p>

She, since his Confinement, call'd one Goodman her Husband, and was try'd with him last Sessions; he for robbing Mr. Gearing, and she as an Accessary to that Robbery, and were both acquitted.</p>
            <p>Wager. This unhappy Person, during the Time of his Confinement, after Sentence, was generally brisk and chearful, and seem'd but very little concern'd at the Prospect of that ignominious Death he was to suffer: And this Temper he maintain'd to the last.</p>
            <p>On Sunday Dec. 19. in the Evening, a Gentleman visited him in his Cell, not out of Curiosity, but purely with a Design to make him serious, and bring him to a Sense of his Condition. As soon as the Gentleman enter'd, he fell a Laughing, for which, being gravely reprov'd, he begg'd Pardon, and said, Sit I do assure you I can't help it, 'twas always my natural Inclination; and when  am put in the Cart and am going to be hang'd, I shall do the same. He was asked, whether the Consideration of his unhappy Circumstances, and the Thought of what would be the End of this his Confinement, did not give him some Un; No, says he, - What signifies it now. If I was to spend my Time over again, I think I would sooner take a Brush and a Basket, and get my Living by Blacking Sh, than live my former Life; but what's done can't be undone; so what signifies plaguing my self about it.</p>
            <p>During his Confinement in the Cell, he was too senseless of his Condition, and instead of improving his Time to his own Advantage, he employ'd himself in drawing with Chalk, upon the Walls, the Picture of Horsenail the Evidence, hanging upon a Gibbet, and underneath he had wrote, Thou Rogue, this will be thy Fate. On another Part of the Wall he drew his own Picture, and that of his Companion Baker hanging likewise upon a Gallows, and under wrote the Year and Day of the Month they were try'd, and the Day they received Sentence of Death. On another Part he had drawn himself and Baker robbing 'Squire Jones; the Squire in the Middle, and Baker, and Wager on each Side, accosting him with &#8211; D - n you Sir, stand and deliver your Cly; if you refuse,  shoot you this Moment thro' the Head, for  are Gentlemen not to be trifled with.</p>
            <p>In this Manner he diverted himself to  last; and after the dead Warrant came down and he was informed he was included in it,  kept the same Temper, and entertain'd himself with the Fate of his Fellow Suffere He  on Tuesday last that Morat the Negro was dead is Prison, and had escap'd hanging, upon which he set himself immediately to work, and drew him likewise against the Wall, hanging upon  Gibbet; and that he might be right as to  Colour of his Man, he drew him with  coal.</p>
            <p>As the Time drew near for his Execution, all his Concern was, that he might have a proper Place in the Cart; he said he was a <rs id="OA17370303-occupation-62" type="occupation">Freeman</rs>

            <p>He was asked, whether he was concern'd i Mr. Hasswell's Robbery he said he was,  Baker was not present at that Juncture; he  in Fig-Lane. He said he knew the very M that had Mr. Hasswell's Watch and Ring;  himself had pawn'd the Watch for 22 s. </p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173703030015"/>

            <p>The same Night that Mr. Lewis was robb'd, Wager, Baker and Eadey, were riding up a Lane, not far distant from the Place where they robb'd him; and a four-wheel'd Chaise turning a Corner into the Lane, they resolv'd to rob it. They had no sooner given the Word, to make the Driver stop, but 10 or 11 Horsemen, coming from the Races, turned out from the same Corner; they were terribly surprized; at last thought their best Way would be to let the Chaise go off, and attack the Horsemen. The Man that drove the Chaise seeing them in some Disorder, whipp'd his Horses, and drove so violently against Baker, that he was knock'd Horse and Man into a Ditch. However, they made him go off, and up they rode Pistol in Hand among the Horsemen, and robbed every Man of them. From this Company they took about 4 l. and Eadey fancying one of their Horses, he made the Rider dismount, and up he got himself, and rode off with him; as they were going home with their Booty,  riding briskly along with his new Horse, which prov'd to be blind, he ran again a Post, and down came he and his Horse to the Ground.

They did not think it safe to return into the House, these 5 Men being in View, and the Dispute they had had with them had so much alarm'd the Country, that there was above an Hundred People out after them; therefore, in the Sight of them all, they mounted their Horses, and took the nearest Way to <placeName id="OA17370303-geo-118">

We were but three of  in Company, myself, Baker and Horseman However, we resolved to attack them: So Baker went up to the Heads of the Horses, and I rode to the Chariot Door, and bid them give me all their Money; Mr. Jones jump'd out  his Chariot and fir'd among us, hap-hazard; he miss'd us, but he shot the Exciseman's Horse dead under his own Footman. I swore I would shoot him thro' the Head, and he said, G- d-n you, shoot and you will, I will not  robb'd. We were under some Apprehension this Time that we should come badly off,  when Mr. Jones fired, a Ball whizz'd close  Horsenail, and he cry'd out, - by G-d I am shot, and away he gallop'd as hard as  could; but Baker and I stood to them aga and attempted to rob them; this was about  o'Clock at Night; we got about 6 or 7 Guineas from them, and a Watch. Baker fris them on one Side of the Chariot and I on the other, but we could make no more of them for it being near the Turnpike, there was an Hundred People after us immediately; so we did not think it safe to stay any longer with them, only at parting I bid them to home and tell their Spouses they had been robb'd, and by a little Boy whose Name was Cockey. Find we were like to be warmly pursu'd, we rode  the Chace, and shelter'd ourselves for some time in a Wood; and when we thought the Hurry was a little over, we ventured out; and th very Night we committed two or three Robberies in our Way to <placeName id="OA17370303-geo-122">

When we attempted Mr. Jones and the Excise-man, we had a Design to have carry'd off the Horse that was kill'd, because we knew him to be worth a great deal of Money. We often had Occasion to ride hard, when we were pursued; and we knew the Exciseman's Horse would go an Hundred Miles in 16 Hours, with he Master's heavy Weight upon his Back, and he would have been worth an Hundred Pounds to us; he would have been of Service to us even in this Robbery, if we could have rode away with him, for in 3 Minutes Time the Alarm of Highwaymen was all over the country. I could (said he) have shot them all, but I never kill'd any Body in my Life, nor ever fir'd a Pistol above twice, and then with no Design to till any Body. Indeed, when I was taken in the Barn, I can't say whether I should not have done some Execution among 'em, if I had had Room and Fire-Arms; but I never carry'd any about me, but when I went out upon Business. Baker us'd always to carry a Blunderbuss under in Coat, and he might (when we were taken) have kill'd them all Four as easy as I can kiss my Hand, for they were in a Pannick, notwithstanding there were so many of them when they ed me.</p>

            <p>We had so little Business (in our Way) after this, that I spent 8 l. before I received a Penny. I think we did no Business for a Fortnight; but Money falling short, I summon'd my Company together, and out we fally'd for a Supply, and that very Night we made 14 l. from one Company on Horseback in <placeName id="OA17370303-geo-132">

And Horsenail broke the Man's Head with the But-end of his Whip, because he told us he had no Money, charging him to remember telling Lies for the future. We generally went out two and two, 2 went one Road, and 2 another, and what we got we always honourable Shared, and never (I believe) play'd Sink'em upon one another: We were always upon Honour.</p>
            <p>We have made so good a Hand of our Business, that I believe I may say twenty Watches have been pawn'd and sold upon Account of the Company, in six Weeks Time, and among them, we generally had two or three Gold ones. But Bonner's Trouble began to make me look about me, and from that Time, I seldom or never was to be seen in London; but hid my self in Barns and Stables when we come off the Road, and never appear'd but upon Business.</p>
            <p>And from one of my hiding Places I was taken, and brought to Town: if Baker's Horse</p>

While we were talking about this, we saw a Man in the Field; I bid Baker lock me in the Stable, and Baker set the Man's Brother (at the House to which the Barn belonged) to watch when the Coast was clear, that I might come in to Breakfast, for the Tea-kettle was upon the Fire, and Baker and I were to return to Breakfast after we had look'd at our Horses. Baker and he were coming to let me out of the Barn (or Stable) and while they were in the Field, they saw the Thief-takers coming up to them: The Man made his Escape, and Baker might have done the same, if he had not been a Fool, for he saw them long enough, before they were upon him, and he was arm'd; but he let them take him, and basely told them, that I was in the Barn; so up they came, and lifted the Door off the Hinges; I heard them before they got in, and hid my self in a Place like a Hay-lost, and cover'd my self with Hay. They hunted about above half an Hour before they found me, and when I was discovered, they were afraid to take hold of me; one said, do you seize him, and another, do you, and they all of them trembled and were frighted out of their Wits. Gentlemen says I, if you want me I'll come down, they told me I was the Person they wanted, so I came down and they seiz'd me; but if I had any Arms, they should not have come near me.</p>

            <p>The following PAPER was design'd to have been spoken by Mr. BAKER, at the Place of Execution; but there being so much Noise and Disturbance that he could not.</p>
            <p>Good People.</p>
            <p>' IT is a Custom, I have observ'd, for us unfortunate Persons, who are condemn'd by ' the Laws of their Country, to yield up their ' Lives as an Attonement for the Facts they ' have committed, and are Convicted of. You ' see me before you, who have been a notorious Sinner, now a miserable Object of Shame, ' ready to die by the just Sentence of human ' Law, and on the brink of another World, ' where I am to appear before a great Judge, ' unto whom all Hearts are open, all Offences ' known, and from whom nothing can be conceal'd; pity my Condition, pray for my Pardon, and let the Sight of my Death work ' serious Thoughts and unfeigned Repentance ' in your selves.</p>
            <p>' It were needless to trouble you, and perplex ' my self with Repetitions of those, Crimes, ' which in the Course of a Life I have committed; it is sufficient that I own the Commission of that Fact for which I die, acknowledge the Justice of that Doom which ' sent me hither, and die in perfect Peace and ' Charity with all Men.</p>
            <p>' In the Course of my Follies, as other Men ' have done, I have proceeded from one Vice ' to another, from Iniquity unto Iniquity, untill the Justice of Providence brought this ' heavy, this mortal Evil upon me. Many ' who are Spectators of my unhappy Death, ' may be Practicers of the same Sins which ' have stain'd my poor Soul, and they would ' do well to reform by my Example, for this ' Purpose I am brought hither, and that my ' Death may answer this Purpose, I pray with ' my last Breath; and therefore I trust the ' Wisdom and Goodness of God will sanctify ' to me this dismal End, by making it a Warning to others.</p>
            <p>' Particularly, I wish the Ignominy of my ' Fate may make proper Impressions on him ' who was the Partner of my Crime, tho' he ' has been fortunate enough to escape being the ' Partner of my Punishment; let this be perpetually a Memorial unto him of God's Mercy ' towards him, and may he improve the remaining Part of his Days in the Service of ' his Creator, and grateful Acknowledgment ' of his Favour towards him; otherwise the ' making an ill Use of this Blessing will augment his Offences, as persevering in that Course ' will finally bring on Ruin, which the Lord ' of Mercy avert! There is nothing now remains, but that trusting in the infinite Mercy ' of God, and in the Merits of my Saviour, ' I submit to what my own evil Deeds have ' subjected me to. Once more I humbly and ' earnestly entreat the Prayers of all good Christians for my departing Soul, and that when ' I am dead, they will suffer the Memory of ' my Crimes to die with me. Lord have ' Mercy on me, Christ have Mercy on me, ' and receive my poor departing Soul.</p>
