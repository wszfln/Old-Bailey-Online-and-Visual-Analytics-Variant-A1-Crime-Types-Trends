            <p>While under Sentence, they were instructed in the Principles of our Holy Christian Religion; in the Original of Right and Property; they were taught the great Evil of the Sin of Murder from several weighty Considerations; and if Murder in general be one of the most heinous Sins, then in proportion the murderer of one's nearer and dearest Relation must be still a greater Sin than common Murder; and not only of one who is most nearly Related, but also who, by the Laws of God and Man, is a superiour Person in Power and Honour; for that the Husband is called the Head of the Wife, her Lord, &amp;c. and therefore the Laws of this Kingdom have wisely declar'd it to be a greater Crime, and affix'd a severer Punishment upon a Wife's murdering her Husband, than upon other Murderers, &amp;c. I likewise insisted upon the Villany and Uncleanness of unnatural Sins, which ought not to be nam'd among People who have any remainders of Civility lest, much less among Christians who profess the true Religion, teaching us to deny all Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts &amp;c especially the Lusts of the Flesh, &amp;c. I show'd 'em the Evil of this Sin from God's visible Judgments inflicted on Sodom and Gomorrah, and the neighbouring Cities, in raining Fire and Brimstone from Heaven upon them, and consuming them as in a Moment, &amp;c, And in the Apostle St Paul, Rom. 1. and St. Jude in his Epistle, inveighing so much against these most impious and notorious Sinners, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In time of delivering these and many other useful Instructions, all of them appeared to be attentive; but no outward Signs of Repentance and Sorrow for Sin, requisite in every sincere Christian, much more in such notable and most impious Offenders, as many, if not all of 'em were; Wood the Murderer was most affected, but he appeared but 2 or 3 Days in Chapel, for falling sick, he died in the Condemn'd Hold a few Days before the Sentence was put in Execution; Billings, who actually murder'd Mr. Hayes, by one stroke of a Hatchet in the hind-part of his Head, was a confus'd, hard-hearted young Fellow, and had few external Signs of Penitence; Mrs. Hayes was too unconcerned, and I fear too often her Mind was taken up with things altogether foreign to the Purpose, and great Work which she had then upon hand; Gillingham, Map, and the rest of 'em were attentive and comply'd with the Worship, excepting one who was a Roman Catholick.</p>

I ask'd him if he knew what Parents he was of? he said, he did not, but believ'd himself to be a Bastard, but a near Relation of Mrs. Hayes, but what way he could not tell; that he was put to a <rs id="OA17260509-occupation-6" type="occupation">Taylor</rs>

Upon such foolish Pretences Wood and he conceived a false Notion, that it was no more a Sin to kill him than a Dog, or a Cat. I told him, that if he was such a wicked Man as he represented him to have been, there was so much the less shadow of Reason to murder him suddenly and unexpectedly, since it was more reasonable upon that very Account to suffer him to live, that he might have time to think upon the evil of his Ways, and repent of his crying Sin, God being always</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA172605090002"/>
            <p>willing to receive into Favour all penitent Sinners, however notorious their Guilt might be. All this he acknowledg'd, adding, that he had never done it, if he had not been sottishly intoxicated with Liquor, so that he knew not what he was doing. He own'd that there was no Cause for so villainous a Murder; and that whatever Punishment was inflicted upon him, was infinitely less than what he deserv'd. He said, that no sooner was the Thing done, but immediately his Conscience was seiz'd with such horrible Guilt, that he would have given the World to have it undone, but that was impossible; and that Mrs. Hayes and he wept and mourn'd most bitterly all that Night. He denied himself to have been upon the first contrivance of the Murder, but that Mrs. Hayes and Wood first consulted about it; and that when it was communicated to him, he agreed to it, and being overcome with Drink, he was so far left of God, as to commit the Murder. Mrs. Hayes deny'd that she ever advis'd Wood or him to make away with him, or that she knew any thing of it till the Fact was done. Wood, who the second Day after Sentence was confin'd to the Hold, and could not come to Chappel, because of a violent Indisposition of which he died, went to Death with it, that Mrs. Hayes press'd upon him for some time to murder Mr. Hayes, but he refus'd; and Billings, when it was propos'd to him, readily comply'd. He also said, that Mrs. Hayes held the Candle whilst he cut off the Head, and advis'd to the cutting his Body in Pieces, in order to carry it off with the greater Conveniency, and was present at the doing of it; but this, as a dying Woman she denied. Wood appear'd to be mightily concern'd and very Penitent. I ask'd Billings, if he knew that Mr. Hayes was his Mother. He said, that she had told him something of it, but that he knew nothing of Mr. Hayes's being his Father. Having formerly upon several Occasions  'em the heinousness of the Sin of Murder, I took opportunity to inform him, that had his Judges known his Relation to the deceas'd, a more painful and ignominious Punishment had been appointed him; and that his Crime was much greater than what the World had been appriz'd of, Parricide, the murdering of a Father, to whom (under God) we owe our all; being in the esteem of all Men thought a much more barbarous and unnatural Act, than the murder of a Stranger, upon whom one had no dependance. This he own'd, but that then he was ignorant of Mr. Hayes's being his Father; and as to the Punishment, he declar'd himself heartily sorry for his Sin; and that he was content to have his Body disjointed, and all his Bones broken Bone by Bone, or to suffer the most painful Death the Wit of Man could invent, since his Punishment was greater than he could bear, &amp;c. Billings said, that from his Infancy he had always liv'd in the Fear of God, that he had studied and practis'd Religion, and of which indeed he wanted not a competent Knowledge for one of his Station; and that, excepting the barbarous Crime of Parricide for which he died, he had never committed any heinous Sin, neither had he been addicted to any of those Vices, either of Whoring, Drinking, Lying, &amp;c. to which too many young Men do incline. He told also, that he had once taken the Sacrament. I told him, that by that one mortal Sin of Parricide he had lost all his former Righteousness. He hop'd the Seed of Grace was left in him. I said, that it appear'd very ill in such hellish Fruits and Effects, however God was able, if he sought him sincerely, to renew him again by Repentance, to which I earnestly exhorted him, his Crime not being a common Murder but Parricide, by his own Confession; for he knew Mrs. Hayes to be his Mother, and consequently Mr. Hayes her Husband to have paternal Relation to him. He declar'd himself most penitent for his Offence, hop'd that God had renew'd him by a true Repentance, and an unfeigned Faith in Christ, and that he car'd not what he suffer'd in this World, so that his Soul might have everlasting Happiness in the World to come. He seem'd to have been a young Fellow of a simple, easy, foolish Temper, and to have been seduced into the Commission of this unheard of Cruelty by the persuasion of Wood, or some way or other, which we shall leave the World to judge upon. He expected Salvation only through the Merits of Jesus Christ, whose Blood speaks better Things than that of Abel; and in all appearance he was very penitent for his Sins, and died in Communion of the Church of England, of which he own'd himself an unworthy Member.</p>

Wood, when I told him this, cast the whole Blame upon her; saying that twenty Days before the Murder happen'd, Mrs. Hayes advis'd and frequently press'd him to murder her Husband, upon doing of which he should be Master of all her Money, which was of a considerable Value; that he would not consent to do it; but that afterwards she proposing to her Son Billings, he too easily agreed to it. Wood held to this Confession till his Death; for two or three Days before he died, as I visited him lying sick in the Hold, he affirm'd the same; adding that she advis'd to the cutting off his Head, Legs, and Arms; and that she held the Candle while it was a doing, &amp;c. All this Mrs. Hayes constantly deny'd, and by all the Arguments I and several who spoke to her could make use of, either from Scripture, as that by confessing her Sins she glorify'd God, &amp;c. or the Reason of the Thing itself, since the grievous Sin, tho' principally committed against God, yet thereby a terrible Offence and Injury was also given to Man; and that without an ingenious Confession, she could not die in the Peace of the Church, &amp;c.

Why? says Hayes. Wood answer'd, Because you are so cruel to that poor industrious Woman, and because you are so atheistical and wicked. Mr. Hayes said, that as to his striking his Wife, he had a Giddiness in his Head at some times, that he knew not what he was doing: and that he believ'd some time or other he should kill his Wife in his Passion, which he could not help. Notwithstanding this, Billings said, that his Mother and Wood first plotted the Murder, altho' when she was present, he stood in awe, and would say nothing of her. What past betwixt Wood and Mr. Hayes is all she would confess, that she knew of any fore-thought or design of murdering Mr. Hayes her Husband. I told her, suppose she knew nothing of a premeditated Intention, yet her concealing the Murder, and abetting the Murderers, &amp;c. made her equally guilty of the Crime in the Eye of the Law; that she acknowledg'd, and said, she desired not to live, but thought she should not be Burnt, &amp;c. I told her, that Burning was the particular Punishment appointed by the Law of England, for Women who were concern'd in the Murder of their Husbands. She wept aud fretted when she thought on this. Asking her, why she conceal'd her Husband's Murder? she said, that the ill Usuage he always gave her cool'd her Affection towards him, and her only Son being concern'd, she could not think of delivering him up to public Justice. She spoke much of Mr. Hayes's beating and mortifying her, and sometimes breaking her Ribs and Bones, and of his having murder'd two new-born Children of her's, and burying them, one under an Apple-Tree, another under a Pear-Tree, at two different Places, where they liv'd in <placeName id="OA17260509-geo-10">

Being ask'd the Reason, why she malign'd and spoke so much to her Husband's Disadvantage, now that he was dead, and murder'd in so barbarous a Manner? She said, that she had no Malice in her Heart to him, but that her being so ill treated by him, was the Cause why she conceal'd the Murder, and was so indifferent about it; and that she could not die in Peace, till she open'd her Mind to me or some Body about the two Children; otherwise, that she entertain'd no grudge against any Person. She seem'd to be a Woman of good natural Parts, but grosly ignorant in religious Matters, which (it may be fear'd) was the cause of her compliance in any degree with such a horrid Action. I was always very pressing upon her to consider her latter end, and to improve the Knowledge of God, and the Salvation which is to be obtain'd, only in and through Jesus Christ, &amp;c. She frequently affirm'd, that she had no doubt of her being happy in another World, and the Reason she gave for this assertion was, because she had been just and upright in her Dealings, charitable to the Poor, careful in Houshold Affairs, faithful and dutiful to her Husband, &amp;c. As to conjugal Duties, I told her, that although she did not actually imbrue her Hands in her Husband's Blood, yet by potronizing and supporting such execrable Murderers, she declar'd herself a very ill Woman, and deserving the Punishment appointed her. At which she sigh'd and groan'd, confessing herself faulty in part; for which she beg'd God and the World Pardon, and declar'd that she heartily repented for the Murder, so far as she was concern'd in it. I inform'd her also, that if she relied upon any good Work of her own for Salvation, she would fail of attaining the end of her Faith, &amp;c. so I advis'd her only to depend upon the Merits and Intercession of Jesus Christ, &amp;c. She said, that she believed in Jesus Christ her only Saviour, upon whose account alone she expected eternal Life and Salvation. By frequent Instructions both before and after her Tryals I brought her to understand some of the first Elements of Christianity; but was greatly troubled to see her much less concern'd than what I desired; for when I spoke to her about the great Concerns of her Soul, she was too ready to bring in some little Story nothing to the purpose: for which, when I reprov'd her, she acknowledg'd her Error. She declar'd herself of the Communion of this Church, of which she was an unworthy Member. When in Chappel I preach'd, or pray'd, or discours'd about Murder, she commonly fainted away, which she acknowledg'd to proceed from the Thoughts and Apprehensions of her Husband's horrible Murder, which still harass'd and stistracted her Mind Night and Day, ever since it happen'd. She hop'd to be sav'd only by the Merits of Christ Jesus, and declar'd that she died in Peace with all Mankind.</p>

            <p>At the Place of Execution, Map got himself loose, threw himself out of the Halter, and jump'd 3 or 4 Yards from the Cart, upon the Heads of the numerous Crowd of People, but the Officers following after him, wounded him with their Pikes, and the Executioner and some others soon brought him back again; Vigous got himself free of the Halter also, which was immediately observ'd: Gillingham was the more desirous of Prayers, having the Night before taken Poyson, and conscious of his Guilt. Wright could not deny his Guilt, but reflected on Newton the Evidence as perjur'd in some Particulars, Griffin would not own the commission of the detestable Sin, but said he had been guilty of Self-Pollutions, Laurence said, that a certain Person had injur'd him, when he took him before the Justice of Peace who committed him, in swearing or affirming that 15 Years ago he had been taken up for that unnatural Sin, and that it cost him l to get himself free, which he said was utterly false, for till this time he was never suspected: Mrs. Hayes was burnt alive; she appear'd altogether unconcern'd, and own'd Billings for her Child, adding nothing to her former Confessions.</p>
