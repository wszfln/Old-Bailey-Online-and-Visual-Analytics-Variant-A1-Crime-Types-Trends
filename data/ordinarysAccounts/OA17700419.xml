He confessed he committed the robbery for which he died, with many others; that he was the person who took the watch out of Mr. Isnell's pocket, while another held a pistol to his breast, of which he declared Clark was intirely innocent, and which Clark's confession, behaviour, and manner under his unhappy circumstance, seemed very strongly to announce; while Green professed his dispair of obtaining the mercy of God, on account of his many henious crimes, particularly being the cause of an innocent man's death, and his great apprehension of being unworthy of God's forgiveness, which he most earnestly prayed for, and constantly attended the duties of the chapel and private prayer, with much reverence and devotion; till the grace of God, co-opperating with the minister's best endeavours, in expounding the Gospel and holy Scriptures, calmed his mind, and gave him reason to hope for better things at the hands of Almighty God.

Slighting their instructions and admonitions, he associated with those whose manner of life best suited his disposition and temper of mind, being naturally giddy, gay, and sprightly, and consequently the more open, and liable to be caught in the lurking snares of every temptation, many and various kinds of which he acknowledges to have fallen into; and though he very justly deserved for his manifold sins and wickedness, the sentence of the law now pronounced on him, yet, that he was entirely innocent of the crime for which he was condemned to die. However, seeing that it was the just judgment of God for all his former villanies, he bore his fate with all christian patience, and resignation to the divine will, and was content to die in peace and charity, good-will and forgiveness with all mankind, particularly his prosecutors, who he said were much deceived in their charge to him; but whether he, Crookhall, and Newman, who were of the communion of the church of Rome, screened the real inward thoughts</p>
