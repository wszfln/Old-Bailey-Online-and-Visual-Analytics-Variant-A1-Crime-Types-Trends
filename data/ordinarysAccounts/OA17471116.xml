I told him again, I hoped he was sensible of its being a Practice contrary to the Law of God in the eighth Commandment, the Sum of which is, that a Man must not hurt his own, nor yet his Neighbours Estate, but so far as he can procure the Good of both. Agreeable to which I moreover told him, was this present Law against Smuggling made, a Practice not tending to procure the real Good of either, but to hurt and ruin Trade in the fair Way of carrying it on, which only deserves the Encouragement of honest Men. Then he said, it is true, I have followed this Practice, which now proves my Ruin; I earnestly beg God to forgive me for this, and all other the Offences of my Life, committed against him or my Neighbour; I repent me of my former Sins, and if the Grace of God assist my present Resolutions, I shall die contentedly, and in Charity with all Men, relying on the Merits of my Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ for my Salvation.</p>

            <p>I hope the Reader may be satisfied with these my Endeavours, to bring them to a proper Sense of their Offences, and if they have not had their desired Effect, I have this to say for myself, I spared no Time nor Pains.</p>
            <p>As I cannot too often repeat wholsome Advice, to Wretches whom Custom in Sin has so much harden'd, as to think they commit no Crime, when they violate the Laws of the Land, I hope the Inserting the following Lines, on the Subject of Smuggling, will prove acceptable.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174711160007"/>
            <p>The common People of England in general, fancy there is nothing in the Crime of Smuggling, but cheating the King of a small Part of his Revenue; and that there is no Harm done to the Community in general, or to the Properties of particular Persons: They think they have a Right to shun, as much as possible, paying any Duty for their Goods, and what they get by their Dexterity in that Manner is honest Gain, to be enjoyed as the Fruits of their Industry and Labour; but a little Consideration will teach them to think otherways, and convince them, that Smuggling is in itself a Crime of worse Consequence to Society, and more hurtful to particular Persons, than many other Crimes which Custom has taught them to look upon with great Abhorrence.</p>
            <p>The Prejudice done the Society, and the Damage received by Individuals, next to the express Declaration of the divine Will, are the best Marks by which we can judge of the Degree of Immorality in any Action whatever; and if we judge of their Crime of Smuggling by this Criterion, we shall find it a Sin of deep Dye, and to deserve the Resentment of every Man, who pretends to any Share of moral Honesty.</p>
            <p>In the first Place, the fair Trader is injured in his Property by their kind of illicit Trade: He pays honestly the Duties and Taxes charged upon his Commodity at his Entry, which in some Cases amounts to near as much as the prime Cost of his Goods at the first Market; this he must charge upon the Consumer, with a living Profit for his Riske, Trouble and Out-lay of his Money; but the Smuggler, who buys his Goods at the same Market, and perhaps at a lower Price, as he chuses the worst Sort upon running them, is able to undersell the fair Dealer at least one Third, and for that Reason is, by the greedy Retailer, preferred, though the Commodity he deals in is worse in Quality. Is not this robbing the honest Merchant of his real Profit, and forcing him either to sell below what his Goods cost, or leave off a Branch of Trade, to which perhaps, he has served an Apprenticeship, and built extraordinary Hopes upon, of being a Support to him or his Family? I appeal to every thinking Man, if there is any material Difference betwixt ruining a Man by robbing him on the Highway, and this Method of beggaring him and his Family by Smuggling? If there is any Difference in Point of Immorality, it must lie on the Side of Smuggling, as the Evil attending it is more universal, and reaches farther. Few Men carry their All in their Pocket; and not one Man in a Thousand is ruined, by what is taken from him by the Highwayman: But there is not a Ship of Goods run upon our Coast but injures Hundreds; perhaps not immediately, but in Process of Time it certainly has that Effect. Not only the Parts adjacent, and the Dealers near the Smuggling Port suffer by this Means, but the most distant Corners of the Kingdom are affected by it in a few Weeks, in Proportion as it lowers the Price of the Commodity, and diminishes the publick Revenue. But it is this lowering the Price which is the great Temptation; the Cheapness of the Smugglers Goods tempts the Retailer to prefer him to the fair Trader, from a mistaken Notion that it is his peculiar Interest to buy as cheap as he can, and consequently he encourages, conceals, and connives at all the Villainies of this Set of People. But if such a Retailer should give himself Time to think, I believe he might easily persuade himself, that he is robbing Peter to pay Paul; that what he gets upon one Article, he loses on another.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174711160008"/>
            <p>It is evident, Taxes must be paid to support the Expences of the Government; and that every Subject, as he enjoys the Benefit of Government, is obliged to contribute his Proportion to that Expence. It is likewise evident, that if the Duties laid upon one Commodity does not answer the Sum charged upon it, that the Deficiency must be charged upon some other. Thus: Suppose the Duties charged upon Teas, Brandy, &amp;c. falls short 100,000 l. of the Sum allotted to be raised upon these Commodities, is it not evident that this 100,000 l. must be charged upon Soap, Candles, Leather, Sand, or some other Branch? Suppose then a Dealer, by dealing with the Smuggler, saves about half the Duty payable to the King, or, which is the same thing, buys it so much cheaper from him than he would from the fair Trader, and that his Gains upon this Article amounts to ten or twenty Pounds a Year, I mean his illicit Gains, or the Difference between the trading Price and smuggling Price; now, as it is evident, that every twenty Pounds gained this Way lessens the Revenue forty Pounds, he or somebody else must re-place this Sum in the Treasury, by a Tax upon another Commodity; from whence it is as clear as the Sum; that instead of gaining twenty Pounds by his smuggling Dealer, he really loses twenty Pounds upon the Ballance. I own, he may not chuse to deal so largely in these other Articles, as to bring it to this Ballance, but some of his Neighbours may. And as much Money as they pay towards making up this Deficiency, occasioned by the Smuggler; just so much does the Person, who deals with such People, rob out of the Pocket of his Neighbour.</p>
            <p>If I was to charge several People, who make no scruple for the Lucre of Profit, to buy Goods which they know to be run, with as foul a Crime as Robbery, or even that of cheating their Neighbour, they would be apt to treat me with some Severity, and think I much injured their Reputation: Yet, upon serious considering the Circumstance attending this Practice, they must at last own, they deserve no better Character than that of a Highwayman and Cheat.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174711160009"/>
            <p>Thus it is plain that Smuggling is a Crime of the most dangerous Nature, both against the Community and private Persons, and as such subject to the Divine Displeasure, as much as any other Felony. It is not only a Sin destructive to Society, and contrary to human Laws enacted for the Peace, Protection, and Subsistence of the State, but is a Sin against the literal Precepts, as well as the Meaning and Intent of Christianity: We are commanded Obedience to Government for Conscience sake; we are commanded to pay Tribute to whom Tribute is due. Our Saviour gave that Answer to the Jews, though that People had as much Reason as any People on Earth, to look upon the Romans as Tyrants, and having no Right to that Tribute, but what they founded upon the superior Force of their Arms; but how much stronger is the Christian Obligation, to pay towards the Support of a Government established? Not by Force or Fraud, butby the Consent of a free People, and conducted by all the Arts of prudent Policy conducing to their Happiness, both in their Religious and Civil Capacities.</p>
            <p>If we consider ourselves as several Members united in one Society for our mutual Peace and Protection, we must conclude it the highest Piece of Injustice in us to refuse or evade by Force or Fraud to pay our Contingent of the Expence incurred for such valuable Purposes, as the securing our Religion and Liberties.</p>
            <p>If the Government was to make any Infringement upon the Properties of Individuals, or aim at lessening the Freedom of the Constitution, how would the Smuggler and his Friends rail and exaggerate the mighty Grievance? Yet at the same Time grudge to pay their Quota, and take all Means in their Power by Deceit or Violence to cheat the Government of what enables them to preserve Order and Peace in the Community.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto had my Eye only on one Branch of Smuggling, viz. The Running of Prohibited Goods from abroad, which is chiefly carried on from the Coast of France to Kent, Sussex, and the neighbouring Counties round about, and from Holland to some Parts of Yorkshire; but there is another not less pernicious to the Commonwealth, viz. Running of unwrought Wool from England to France. The Damage done the industrious Clothier in all Parts of the Kingdom, is too glaring to need any Exaggeration. If we only consider what a Number of Hands are employ'd in Manufacturing a Ship-load of Wool, who must all starve when that Wool is exported to our Rivals in Trade, and Enemies to our Interest. This Trade employs the Poor among the French, strengthens their Hands, increases their Treasure, and enables them to vye with us at foreign Markets in our Staple Commodities. A few Mecenary Masters of Sheep-Walks may gain by this pernicious Trade, but how many Thousands, nay, Millions of Poor have Reason to Curse the Ill-gotten Wealth; and what a prodigious Increase does this Article alone make in all the Parish Rates in the Cloathing Counties of England: Not only the Industrious Poor sit idle and starve, but they become a Burthen to the wretched Remainder, and the Contagion spreads like a Plague, and infects with Poverty the whole Island. These Considerations alone are sufficient to awaken the Conscience of the Guilty in this Way, and to hinder us from affording them an unseasonable Compassion; but there yet remains some other Circumstances to blacken the Blackness of their Crime. These are the Manner in which they go about to execute their Smuggling Purposes.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174711160010"/>
            <p>They go in Companies together, armed with all Manner of offensive Weapons, and escorted by the most profligate Wretches they can pick up: They employ none in their Service but Fellows who have given Instances that their Consciences are Proof against all Checks of Morality, Religion or Law, and whose Courage is equal to the most daring Attempts upon thePeace of the Society. By these Men Perjury amongst others, is looked upon as a venial Transgression, beneath the Conscience of a Gentleman Smuggler to be troubled with. Murder, Rapes, and Robberies are with them but as frequent, as they conduce to their Interest. Their Character, their Cruelty, and Numbers has given them another Source of Encouragement, and a new set of Allies. For Numbers of the Country People who perhaps abhor their Practice, from the Dread they have justly conceived of their Power, find themselves obliged, tho' against their Wills, to connive at or conceal, and even to assist them, and when they are not willing, they are compelled to lend their Aid. For when a Smuggling Vessel touches on the Coast, those concerned or their Associates meet at a Place of Rendezvous, and press all the Horses they meet with for their Service, which they sometimes return, and sometimes not, just as their Business requires, and the Owners dare not complain for fear of having their Throats cut, or their Houses set on Fire: Not only single Houses, but whole Villages and trading Boroughs are kept in this slavish Dependence upon them, out of real Apprehension of Danger, without any Regard to Profit in dealing with them.</p>

I endeavoured by such Arguments, as I was Master of, to to persuade him to think the Contrary, which indeed was no difficult Task to bring him too: I observed to him that (as for the Excuse he pleaded, viz. It is a small Thing, and he did not think so much ado would have been made about so little a Matter) the more wicked and abject Sinner he, that would corrupt himself for so small a Thing as seemed to be in his Eye: Though at the same Time I told him, it was looked upon by every Body else, to be a very iniquitous Scheme, he had laid, to defraud a poor Orphan, and frustrate the Purposes of the poor deceased Parent, who had ventured his Life for the Support of his Family; and that he who will rack and corrupt the Conscience for a Triffle, will never stick to do five Times worse, for a Matter of</p>

            <p>Upon this he appeared to be pretty much struck with Surprize, and said he had indeed been an idle loose Person, profligate and extravagant: Being off from the Ship he belonged to, he says, for near a Twelvemonth e'er this atrocious Crime, of Forgery, was committed, he had spent a great deal of Money idly, that he had almost ruined his unhappy Mother, who had indulged him with all she could get, and more than she could well spare.</p>

But being advised, that even a Breach of Trust, the purloyning others Property, and offering to convert to his own Use, what he knew was not his own, was directly contrary to the Laws of God, and Man, and that therefore he could plead nothing in his own Favour, whatever his Necessities, or that of his Family were; he was content to own his Fault, and to look upon it in a much worse Light, than he had seen it in before. His Friends had now forsaken him, his Follies and Extravagancies had removed him far out of their Sight, and he had none to help him: Being young, and imprudent, and thinking to help himself, by unjust and iniquitous Methods, he made an Enemy of that great Being, who is alone able to help Men out in the greatest Straits and Necessities, who gave him up to his own Lusts, and let him follow his own Imaginations.</p>
