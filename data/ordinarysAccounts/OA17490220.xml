Not one Friend, or Relation came near me for the Space abovementioned, nor had I one Farthing in my Pocket; so that all the Support I really had for that Time, was given me by those, who were at that Time my fellow Prisoners. I leave it then to any-body's Judgment, whether I was not in terrible Circumstances, especially having no Expectation from my Friends; and no Views of getting clear of my then present Enthralment: Added to this the Thoughts of still labouring under these Misfortunes, (for how long Time I did not know, but had Reason to believe no short Time) made me undertake to cure a desperate Disease by a more desperate Remedy. And so one Day being in a very melancholy and pensive Humour, I sat me down alone, and began to consider of some Methods, how to get over my Troubles: And a sure one indeed (God, and the Gentlemen whom I should greatly have injured, I hope will pardon me for it) I found out; for unhappily I thought of this wicked Scheme, which I immediately set about, and put in Practice. But as God is my Judge, my Intention was not absolutely to wrong Messieurs Belchier and Comp. For, if I had got the Money, my real Design was to have converted it, (as I was brought up some Part of my Time to the <rs id="OA17490220-occupation-31" type="occupation">Manchester Trade</rs>

All that I have more to say is, that I have as near as I can related the real Truth of this Affair.</p>

There were indeed some Circumstances sworn by others, that might bring me under a strong Suspicion, as my going to the Bank and the Refiner's, which I did to serve Coffey, he not daring to go abroad much himself for fear of an Arrest; but as Coffey's Oath was manisestly to save his own Life, and that his Character was so infamously impeached, as before mentioned, let Circumstances be ever so pregnant, I do not see how</p>

Besides, he swore only as to foreign Coin, which did not affect my Life, yet he got circumstantial Credit with the Jury. Mr. Sandal produced a Piece of File, some Fragments of a Crucible, and a very small Particle of Gold alledged to have been found in my Room. But was this a Circumstance of any Weight, when Coffey, who confessed himself guilty of the Practice, lodged in the same Room, and might have been Owner of these Things unknown to me, he having a Trunk with Lock and Key, whereby to conceal his Instruments from me. Sandal also produced three Guineas, which he got with ten more in my Pocket, one wanting 6 d. the other 11 d. and the third 1 s. 11 d. to the best of my Memory; and might not a Man have thirteen Guineas in his Pocket, and three of them be light unknown to him; besides its plain they came from different Hands, as they were so different in their respective Lightness; for if they were diminished by one Hand, they would have been nearer to each other than half and half in Lightness; and as they were found with ten more in the same Pocket, which were full Weight, is it probable, had I known them to be diminished, but I would have had them apart; besides Sandal swore only that they were light, but</p>

As to Mr. Disten, the Refiner's Man, he swore nothing but Truth against me, viz. that I several Times sold Gold at his Master's, which in truth I did, but for Coffey's Use, and as to the Entry in the Memorandum Book, I believe I made such an Entry to satisfy Coffey what Money of his came into my Hands from the Refiner's from Time to Time, because Coffey having made me often a Bearer for him to the Refiner's, used to bring me to an Account. Mr. Disten, however, was not quite so honest with respect to Mr. Connor; for in his Information before Justice Green, which was read to me, he swore he see Connor at his Master's once selling Gold, in the Month of March last, but upon Trial, he thinking it improbable that he would be supposed to know a Man at one View for near nine Months, and never seeing him before or after, till in Prison, to mend this Defect, swore he see him at his Master's but once, and that in July last, which Connor hereby declares to be abominably false, as he does Mr. Fretwell's swearing to have given him Money several Times at the Bank, Connor hereby protesting before God, that he never received any Money whatever from the said Fretwell at the Bank, or elswhere, but owns that for Mr. Coffey's Use, and as a Messenger from him he received Money from Mr. Welsh twice only, tho' Welsh swore he frequently received Money from him, in order, as I believe, to have him convicted at any Rate.</p>

            To his Royal Highness, Prince GEORGE, Duke of CORNWALL, And eldest Son of his Royal Highness FREDERICK PRINCE of Wales, on his acting the Part of Cato at Leicester House.</p>
            <p>- Tuusjam regnat Apollo.</p>
            <p>VIRG.</p>
            <p>HAIL! little Cato, taught to tread the Stage. Awful, as Cato of the Roman Age; How vast the Hopes of thy maturer Years, When in the Boy such Manly pow'r appears! Say, what Spectator but did pleas'd admire To hear thee talk with Sage Catonick Fire, A tender Stripling of the Royal Blood Breathing his Country's Liberty and Good; What Rapture warm'd thy Princely Father's breast! What joy thy scepter'd Grandsire then confess'd! Beholding thee, a Tyro from the School, Foreshew the Wisdom of thy future Rule, And Ned, thy little Juba, play his Part, Half form'd by Nature in Bellona's Art.</p>
            <p>Well may we say, when Royalty thus deigns To grace the Stage, that now Apollo reigns, Whose tuneful Hand maids shou'd exult to see Such regal Honour done to them in thee, Nor less thy Shade, O! Addison rejoice, To find thy Cato made a Cato's Choice.</p>
            <p>Lo! Britain glories, in thy Years to trace A buskind Hero of the Brunswick Race, Her Stage now trod (tho' Collier, once thy Scorn) By destin'd Monarchs, and high Princes born; Augusta too, some King's allotted Bride, Adorns her Scenes, and gives an equal Pride; But Oh! When thou shalt once thy Scepter wield, And Edward shine dread leader of the Field; When thou a Cate's, he a Juba's Task Perform in real Action, not in Masque; At Home, when thou'lt thy Country's Good enhance, While he Abroad shall stem the Pride of France; When thou'lt establish Europe's wish'd Repose, Returning he the Gates of Janus close; Then, then Britannia may with Reason boast, Nor think her Blood or Treasure fruitless Cost;</p>
            <p>O! may she hail, (but late) the glorious Day, When exercising thus imperial Sway; Of Sire and Grandsires Vertues thou possess'd Shalt gentle rule, and make thy People bless'd; When harrass'd Europe, rescu'd from Alarms, Shall owe her Rest to George and Edward's Arms.</p>
            <p>Rous'd with the Thought, and impotently vain I now wou'd launch into a nobler Strain; But see! the Captive Muse forbids the Lays Unfit to sketch the Merit, I wou'd praise; Such, at whose Heels, no galling Shackles ring, May raise their Voice, and boldly touch the String. Cramp'd Hand and Foot while I in Goal must stay, Dreading each Hour the Execution Day. Pent up in Den, opprobious Alms to crave. No Delphick Cell, ye Gods! nor Sybil's Cave; Nor will my Pegasus obey the Rod, With massy Iron barbarously shod; Thrice I essay'd to force him up the Height, And thrice the painful Gives restrain'd his Flight.</p>
            <p>So when a sickly Snake attempts to creep And climb some slipp'ry Rock, or Ditches steep: Scarce half her Length advanc'd she backward falls. And in slow Volumes languishingly crawls.</p>

            <p>HAIL! Adam's gen'rous in thy Soul as Blood, Chosen Recorder, and our certain Good; While thousands now, to magnify thy worth, Applaud his Choice, and set thy Merits forth; Still, like thy self, be gentle; nor refuse The lowly Tribute of a Captive Muse, Tho' rude her Strains and impotent her Flight, Accept benign her poor officious Mite;Nor doubt, but what the Poet wants of Art He ransoms with Sincerity of Heart: Say whence I must the Web Pierian spin, Shall I, or with thy private Life begin? Or with thy public, fill my feeble Lays? Either's too great a Theme for me to praise,</p>
            <p>Then let me paint thee on the Judgment-seat Awful, serene, and modestly elate; No fullen Frown betok'ning Cause of Fear, Meekness and Candour in thy Looks appear, Mercy and Justice, the good Judge's Fame, Embrace in thee, and consecrate thy Name.</p>
            <p>The Court now open'd, and the Jury sworn, Stands at the Bar some Criminal forlorn, Not worth of little Pelf, a Council's Fee, But sure to find a Council then in thee, However bad his Crime, or mean his State, He meets in thee both Judge and Adocate: For Poor and Rich must equal Justice share. No Favour, nor respect of Persons, there; No partial Byass, tho' 'tis ever thine To Mercy, darling Mercy, to incline.</p>
            <p>Again: I hear thee scrutinously sift Some perjur'd Witness, now devoid of Shift; While you, conducted by Astraea's Clue With Question, and Cross-question, him pursue, Probe to the Bottom ev'ry Circumstance, And catch the flying Truth with seeming Chance. On a bright Morning, so the od'rous Crew Chace the swift Hare, and thunder o'er the Dew; The cunning Puss avoids them many a Wind, But leaves a hot perfidious Scent behind; Led by the Scent thro' every wily Maze, Close they pursue him, and at last they seize.</p>
            <p>But still, thy Learning strikes with more surprize When on a Trial Points of Law arise, Year Books, Reports, and Entries, are display'd With the Same Ease, as in thy Presence lay'd, The Volume, Page, and Author's Name you trace, As if thou wer't a Code of Common-place: O Memory immense! O real Son And certain Heir of mighty LITTLETON: Well have the May'r and Aldermen decreed That you, the late RECORDER shou'd succeed. Self-Easers! by thy Wisdom manag'd right, To make their Burden of the City light.</p>
            <p>The Bard attends thee giving now the Charge, The Evidence before rehears'd at large. Here you disclose the Riches of your Sense In a resistless Tide of Eloquence; This while we think the wretched Criminal Must, to the Laws, a Victim sudden fall; Again we hear him clear'd, by Force of Wit, If Circumstances can at all admit. So far thy nervous Orat'ry prevails, Justice, in Doubt, forbears to lift her Scales; By Evidence alone, the Jurors taught. Declare their Verdict, and escape all Fault: If an Acquittal, Pleasure we may trace, Th' Effect of Mercy in thy very Face. But, O, if Guilty I What a dire Contest Duty and Pity, wage within thy Breast! With what a tender Eye you look on him Thy Heart wou'd pardon, but the Laws condemn; While conscious of thy Fellow-creature's Fears You pass the Sentence, not without some Tears.</p>
            <p>Thrice happy London! scarce exempt the Grudge of neighb'ring Cities, in so wise a Judge: Late may it be, O! very late be said, Thou need'st a new RECORDER in his stead; But may he long survive of Heav'n, the Care, No less the Poet's than the City's Pray'r.</p>

Sunk from the Epic to low Elegy.</p>
            <p>Were this once boasted Minion of the Nine, A Victim doom'd, for Libitina's Shrine; Did he attempt to sing beneath thy Fate, And from his own, to foreign Lore translate. How fainter wou'd his dying Notes appear, Not like the Swan's, more musically, clear; But to the Cyclic Writers Strain declined, And in an Ovid, we'd a Bavius find. Decree'd to Death severe, a worse Exile, You rise from Flaccus, to the Mantuan Stile: At Ease translating Pope's Horatian Lay, His Epic Song of Fame you now display; And in such Numbers, as may justly claim No vulgar Mansion in the Doom of Fame; The Dome of Fame, where Pope himself might pride To see thee plac'd by his, and Honour's Side; While fast in sad portending Shackles bound You make his Lays in those of Maro sound, In Language far from thy domestick grown, But by thy tow'ring Genius made thy own. None wrote than you, we therefore must confess With greater Spirit, and Advantage less.</p>
            <p>Nor modestly in this my Candour tax, Because great Rawleigh wrote beneath the Ax; He did, 'tis own'd, but still in his Distress Had Money, Books, and ev'ry Friends Access: Not pent in gloomy Cell, and Gives he lay, Nor was his Food one Penny-loaf a Day; Nor Water was his Drink, nor Boards his Bed, Nor Stone (thy Pillow!) to support his Head; Death's horrid Prospect only cou'd controul The learn'd unlocking of his treasur'd Soul; With ev'ry other full Advantage bless'd By Night at Study, and by Day caress'd; Grim Death himself lowr'd in a distant View Not ev'ry Sun expected, as in you; In you from all these needful Comforts torn From Home, from Country, wretched and forlorn, Insulged, menac'd, taunted and abus'd, Of ought that's gentle and humane refused. Ost fore'd the Fumes of Ordure to inhale, Such is the Treatment of a Newgate Jail, O! wert thou but dimiss'd and render'd free, What Wonders might'st thou work at Liberty; When captive and distract with Death's Alarms, Thy Verse, surprises and with Rapture warms; Perhaps if freed thy bolder first Design Might be some Hero of the Brunswick Line, Taught by thy Muse to stride the sanguine Field, Now face the Cannon, now the Faulcion wield; Now midst the thickest Ranks of Foes engage, While all the Battle thunders in thy Page, While ev'ry Reader kindled by thy Strian, A Chief in Fancy! Vows the next Campaign.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, thy Fate I shou'd not half regret, Did real Guilt thy Miseries beget, Ev'n I, who'd favour any Son of Rhime, Scarce well could pardon thy imputed Crime, Imputed falsely; half an Eye may see There wert convicted; how? by Perjury; The Implement of which to common Sense, Appears of some too black for Evidence; Himself imprisoned first upon the Charge, Then turning Witness to be set at large; Impeach'd of threesold Forgery beside, In the same Court thy hapless Cause was try'd, Each Forgery within its guilty Womb Brooding the Monster Perjury, thy Doom! The Judge, his Fame so manifestly sad, Stiling him Man indeed, but very bad; These, and as many Circumstances more Demand my Pity; who wou'd not deplore Close to behold thee in a Dungton hemm'd? The learn'd at once, and innocent condemn'd!</p>
            <p>Yet be consold, for still there is a Place, Reserv'd for Mercy, and for royal Grace; Maugre this Storm, thou may'st survive to sing The wonted Bounty of our gracious King, Eccho repeating to each Hill and Plain, That Peace and Meekness bless a George's Reign.</p>
            <p>But whither have I, by Concern betray'd Far from my first intended Master stray'd? While my unhallowed Lays were only meant The sacred Beauties of thy Muse to paint; From sadder Numbers scare can I resrain Intending thee to sing, I but complain; Say, Guiltless Bard, what Patron wilt thou chuse, A Stanhope or a Pelham for thy Muse; Or both, or either may thy Pardon sue, Both fond of Learning, and of Mercy too, Ev'n to thy self I shall submit the Choice, And only say, whoever has the Voice, If pardon'd thou, or doom'd, alass! to die, May boast a precious Gift, or Legacy.</p>

            <p>Laturam Misero te mihi rebar opem.</p>
            <p>Ovid.</p>
            <p>THOU great Protectress of th' Aonian Train' Support in each cotemporary Reign; Brightest Devotress at the Delian Shrine, Oft sung and courted by the sacred Nine; If e'er thy Kindred, of immortal Fame, The Muses lov'd, nor scorn'd a Poet's Name: If e'er thySelf vouchsafe to touch the Lyre, And join'd with equal Voice the tuneful sQuire: If on the Canvass, to describe the Face With animated Bloom, and living Grace, To draw the vernal Flow'r and tinging Shape, The Peach, the Melon, and the ripen'd Grape, To make each Story, holy or profane, Move in the Landskip, and to Vision plain: If these, with courtly Wit and Eloquence, Be Gifts, Apollo did to thee dispense, Which sure they are, in Charity regard; The meanest of his Sons, a Captive Bard; Far, far, alas! from Home, and Native Clime, The first, perhaps, that did in Newgate Rhime: The first, perhaps, beneath his dreadful Doom, That ever mounted the poetick Loom.</p>
            <p>O! born thyself of high Pierian Blood, Boast of their Times, nor yet more learn'd than good; Display thy Bounty, where a Life's at stake, And save the Wretched for the Poet's Sake; The Poet pent in narrow darkling Cell With Vagrants and Bandities, forc'd to dwell In pond'rous Gives of Iron, rudely bound, A Stone his Pillow, and his Bed the Ground: One Penny Loaf, the Banquet of a Day, And chilling Water to dilute his Clay; Broke ev'ry Morning of his painful Rest, The Scorn of Turnkeys, and the Keeper's Jest. Sternly rebuk'd, if he the least complains, And menac'd with a double Load of Chains. Thus, Day, and Night, disconsolate I spend Unpittied, and debarr'd of ev'ry Friend, Deserted by the Muses, as by Men, Save Elegeia's Visits now and then: Daughter of Grief! an ever-plaintive Muse, Taught only Songs of Sorrow to infuse. Dire Comfort! thankful yet am I, that she Inspires these Lines, O Queensbury! to thee.</p>
            <p>Thou then, from Infant Years brought up in Courts, Directress of their Houshold, and their Sports; The brilliant Grace of both the George's Age, In Wit facetious, and in Council sage, Allow'd, as heretofore, the same Access, Pity this Bard, and banish his Distress; Maintain the Glory of thy former Days, And iutercede to save a Son of GAY'S; Nor be it ever said, in British Land, That a poor Bard was mercilessly hang'd.</p>
