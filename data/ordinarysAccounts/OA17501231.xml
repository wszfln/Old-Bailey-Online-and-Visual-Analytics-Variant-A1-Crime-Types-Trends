The Fact was committed in June, but he had the good Luck to keep out of the Way, and was not brought to Trial till December Sessions. All this was no Warning, nor did in the least affect him; and he was no sooner set at Liberty, but he returned to a lewd Woman, with whom he had before kept Company, and liv'd with her some Time, till he had got rid of his Distemper and Vermin, and then he went to his old Trade: But Danger appearing, he got on Board a Ship employed in the Coast Trade, and was absent from Town till the Scent was pretty well worn out, and he thought he might return with some Safety.</p>
            <p>His Life has since been one continued Scene of Robbery and Burglary, and the Fact he suffers for he did not deny, tho' he would particularly own none other, being resolved to die as he had lived, a harden'd, wicked Wretch, whom no Warnings or Admonitions could prevail with.</p>

            <p>The Beginning of the Week before Execution, he sent for a Shopkeeper in Newington-Butts, whom he robbed of Goods to a considerable Value but the Night before he was taken up for the Fact he was committed for, under Pretence of letting him know where his Goods were, and how he might recover them; but when the Man came, it appeared to be only a Design to get Money from him, which he asked for before he would speak of the Goods. The Person did not chuse to give him what he asked for, left he might afterwards deceive him; but put it in the Hands of another to give him, in Case he found the Discovery to be true, and he recovered the Goods. Tidd was not satisfied with this, but in a Wrath declared, he never would tell either the Person robb'd, or any Body else, where they were. Such were his wicked Resolutions, altho' he own'd he knew where they were, that they were neither pawn'd nor sold, and that they were in the very Place where he conceal'd them immediately upon stealing them. Thus wickedly obstinate wasthis Wretch to the last, and Proof against all Advice to make what Amends was in his Power, to every one whom he had wronged or injured. No Sense of Mercy formerly received had any Weight with him; his Ignorance and Insensibility seem'd to be invincible, and he continued a most hardened Person, till at the Place of Execution, and then he began to weep, and to shew some Marks of a Sense of his unhappy Condition.</p>

But, at last, his idle Disposition, and the bad Company he kept, raised so much the Resentment of the honest Labourers in that Business, that they could scarce suffer him to come among them, and when he did, he was sure to hear of his Tricks.

However, Ben has since owned the Fact, and that he was the Man that held up the Pistol at Mr. Harsel, while another fired at him, but the Pistol missed Fire. Nor was this any Warning, but Ben must return to his old Tricks, which he did in a Day or two after this Escape, and continued to commit Robberies,</p>

            <p>The last Robbery is that for which he suffered, being taken immediately after it was done; in which he shewed himself a thorough-paced wicked Man, by Menaces and Threats to murder Mr. Dickenson, if he did not desist from making a Noise: But as he still kept calling the Watch, they all three thought proper to make the best of their Way off, and took his Hat with them.

            <p>Immediately upon Conviction, Ben's Courage was all lost, he took it to Heart, and fell ill, and so continued for some Days; but recovering himself again a little, he was able to attend the Chapel, and behaved well, and with Decency to the last. And he seemed to die sensibly affected with the Errors of his past Life, and of the Necessity of his Dependence upon the Merits of Christ.</p>

            <p>The Fact for which he dy'd was done, he says, in Manner following: The Servant of the House where he work'd had not fasten'd the Window Shutter so close as it ought to be, and he happen'd that Night to try it; and finding the Pin fall out upon his turning the Bolt, he took down the Shutter, and went in at the Window, and brought out the Things mentioned in the Indictment. Next Morning he went to work again as usual, and upon hearing of what had been done, appeared very merry, and laughed at the Man and Maid-Servant, saying, they were Fools to suffer their Master's House to be robb'd. He continued working there till the 29th of October, when he was taken up and committed.</p>

            <p>To attempt to convince these People of the Heineusness of their Crimes is next to an Impossibility, they will hardly hear you with any tolerable Temper; they fancy there is nothing in Smuggling but cheating the King of a small Part of his Revenue; and that there is no Harm done to the Community in general, or to the Properties of particular Persons; they think they have a Right to shun, as much as possible, paying any Duty for their Goods, and what they get by their Dextority in that Manner, is honest Gain, to be enjoyed as the Fruits of their Industry and Labour; but surely if these People would but listen to the Voice of Reason, they must certainly be convinced, that Smuggling is in itself a Crime of worse Consequence to Society, and more hurtful to particular Persons, than many other Crimes, which Custom has taught them to look upon with great Abhorrence.</p>
            <p>In the first Place, the fair Trader is injured in his Property by their kind of illicit Trade: He pays honestly the Duties and Taxes charged upon his Commodity at his Entry, which in some Cases amounts to near as much as the prime Cost of his Goods at the first Market; this he must charge upon the Consumer, with a living Profit for his Risk, Trouble, and laying out his Money; but the Smuggler, who buys his Goods at the same Market, and perhaps at a lower Price, as he chuses the worst Sort upon running them, is able to undersell the fair Dealer, at least one Third, and for that Reason is, by the greedy Retailer, preferred, though the Commodity he deals in is worse in Quality. Is not this robbing the honest Merchant of his real Profit.</p>
            <p>It is evident, Taxes must be paid to support the Expences of the Government; and that every Subject, as he enjoys the Benefit of Government, is obliged to contribute his Proportion to that Expence.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175012310012"/>
            <p>It is likewise evident, that if the Duties laid upon one Commodity does not answer the Sum charged upon it, that the Deficiency must be charged upon some other. And as much Money as they pay towards making up this Deficiency, occasioned by the Smuggler, just so much does the Person, who deals withsuch People, rob out of the Pocket of his Neighbour.</p>
            <p>It is plain that Smuggling is a Crime of the most dangerous Nature, both against the Community and private Persons, and as such subject to the Divine Displeasure, as much as any other Felony. It is not only a Sin destructive to Society, and contrary to human Laws enacted for the Peace, Protection, and Subsistence of the State, but is a sin against the literal Precepts, as well as the Meaning and Intent of Christianity: We are commanded Obedience to Government for Conscience sake; we are commanded to pay Tribute to whom Tribute is due. Our Saviour gave that Answer to the Jews, though that People had as much Reason as any People on Earth, to look upon the Romans as Tyrants, and having no Right to that Tribute, but what they founded upon the superior Force of their Arms; but how much stronger is the Christian Obligation, to pay towards the Support of a Government established, not by Force or Fraud, but by the Consent of a free People, and conducted by all the Arts of prudent Policy conducing to their Happiness, both in their Religious and Civil Capacities?</p>

            <p>ten thousand Poundsworth of Goods at a Time, and always took Care to pay for the said Goods at the Time appointed by the Company. But as he sustained every now and then considerable great Losses upon the Goods bought at these Sales, at last his Fortune was greatly diminish'd, and in a Manner lost; which (unfortunately for him) induc'd him to make use of the unhappy Methods for which he has suffer'd, to raise Money, only to supply present Purposes, without direct Intention to have defrauded any Person whatever, but on the contrary, in Hopes to have had some lucky Chance or other, in his large Undertakings, to have redeem'd his past Losses; and his real Intentions, he declar'd, was to have paid the Gentleman in full of whom he borrow'd the Money; his flattering Hopes gave him strong Presumption so to think. He was a Man that never was addicted to drinking, gaming, &amp;c. the Vices of the Age, nor given to any Extravagancy whatever. He was a Man that bore an exceeding good Character in the World, which did appear from the Character given him by several worthy Gentlemen, and some of the most eminent Merchants of this great Metropolis, who appear'd on his Behalf upon the Trial; so that had his Intention been really inclin'd to have defrauded, he might have got many Thousands of Pounds of Money and Effects into his Hands, of other People's, and gone off with the same, without the least Suspicion from any Person whatever.</p>
            <p>N.B. As he used to buy such large Quantities of Goods at these Sales, he was obliged to borrow large Sums upon Interest, to make good his Payments; for which Sums he has, upon an Average, paid above four hundred Pounds per Ann. for Interest, for upwards of these eight Years past, and had continually great Losses upon these Goods likewise.</p>
            <p>He, with the utmost Sense of the Badness of the Practice, acknowledged his having been but too much concerned in handing about bad India Warrants. He was content to be made an Example to the Justice of his Country, and wish'd it might have the Effect intended, viz to prevent any one for the future from attempting to make use of such unwarrantable Measures, as by serving their own present Purposes may impose upon, and defraud any Individual, or Body of Men.</p>

He told me he would indorse Mr. Sandys's Note to me, which I took. I was satisfied with his Indorsement, knowing him sufficient to answer the Sum to me. After this Mr. Barnes desired me to prove Mr. Sandys's Note of Hand under the Commission, as he was become a Bankrupt; upon which I ask'd him, How I could prove it, as having no Concern with the Bankrupt? He told me, as he had my Note of Hand for the same Value, I might prove it, and say, it was for a valuable Consideration. Upon this I went to prove the Note, but in my Hurry, as having never proved a Debt before under a Commission, and there being great Debates and Quarrelling at the Meeting, I inadvertently proved the Note for Goods sold and</p>

            <p>deliver'd, neither did I know at that Time but the whole Money was due to Mr. Barnes, this Note being given by Mr. Sandys to him on a Mortgage of Teas; but upon Enquiry into the Bankrupt's Affairs, Mr. Barnes was intitled to prove no more than two hundred and ninety Pounds; and I most solemnly declare, as I must soon answer for all my Actions before a true and just God, what I did was without Consideration or Benefit, directly or indirectly, or any Promise or Reward whatever, but to the contrary, I was one hundred eighty-six Pounds out of Pocket for the same, and only have received forty Pounds of Mr. Barnes towards the Expences I was put to.</p>
            <p>W. BAKER.</p>
            <p>Witness my Hand, this 24th of December, 1750.</p>
            <p>In respect to the above Account given by Mr. Baker, under his own Hand, he always, when talk'd to upon that Affair, did declare, viz. That in his Conscience he did believe Mr. Barnes had no Intention of imposing upon him, or putting him upon doing an unjustifiable Thing; but, on the contrary, he was verily persuaded Mr. Barnes had no other View, but to receive only his just Due: And added, that from what did arise of his own Knowledge of that Gentleman, and the Reputation he bore with the mercantile Part of the World, among whom were his grand Concerns, he could not entertain an Opinion that Mr. Barnes would knowingly have put upon him doing a wrong Thing. To this Purpose was always his Declaration; he express'd himself to the same Effect the Sunday Evening before his Execution, in Presence of several of his particular Friends, who came to take Leave of him, and continued in the same Way of thinking to the last, as may be made appear by a Letter which Mr. Baker sent to Mr. Barnes the Night before Execution.</p>
            <p>Various were the Reports, and many the Aspersions every Day handed about upon Mr. Baker's former Conduct in Life, which came to his Ears while under Sentence of Death. There are some Things he does not deny, but upon Account of which he was highly blameable, to atone for which he was to forfeit his Life, and hoped Forgiveness from all those whom he has wrong'd or injur'd. As to many other Things that were said of him without any Foundation, he gave Ear to them, and passed by with generous Disdain, saying, What he really had in Justice to answer for, was sufficient Weight for him to bear, and he was sorry the World should endeavour to load him with more than what really belonged to him. Where he has done an Injury, the injur'd must be but too sensible of it, and need not to be told what is done; and where there is no Injury done, there is no particular Right to call Mr. Baker's Character in Question, since he has satisfied the Justice of the Law by his Suffering; and as he own'd the Justice of the Punishment inflicted on him, and submitted willingly to his Fate, he wished this might so far plead in his Behalf, as to put a Stop to all false Reports; that the Family to which he belong'd, already sufficiently afflicted upon Account of the unhappy Measures he pursued, might not still have Additions to their Sorrows.</p>
            <p>His Behaviour all along was quite composed and resigned, and such as was, by all that saw him to the last Minutes, admired and approved of.</p>

When the Executioner had tied them all up to the fatal Tree, some Time was spent in recommending them to the Divine Protection; and then the Carts were drawn from under them, incessantly, while Breath lasted, calling on God, and Jesus Christ, to hear their Cry, and to receive their Souls. When they were cut down, their Bodies were delivered to their Friends; Mr. Baker's was carried away in a Hearse, Watling's and Carbold's in another, were carried down to their own Country; only Connor, and two others, 'tis said, were taken for the Use of the Surgeons. And the Execution was done with as little Noise and Disturbance as the Nature of so tragical a Scene will admit.</p>
