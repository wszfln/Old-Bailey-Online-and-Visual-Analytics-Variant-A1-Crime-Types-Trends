            <p>This Inn, it seems, was at that Time, a Place of resort for the Smugglers. When they had any Goods to bring to Town, there they were generally first lodged, and from thence sent out to their Customers in Parcels. Seeing Creed a stout Fellow, the Smugglers look'd upon him to be a proper Man for their Service, and often endeavoured to persuade him to go down with them into Sussex, and Kent, telling him he should live very well, and have good Wages. But as yet he liked living in his Brother's Service very well, and refused to comply with their Solicitations. It happened, however, in process of Time, that a noted Smuggler bought a Horse of his Brother, which Creed had been used to take Care of, it being not quite broke, he was desired to ride it down into <placeName id="OA17490804-geo-24">

Having brought the Horse pretty quiet, he was minded to return to London, but, before they let him go, they wanted him to try how the Horse would behave in the Smuggling Business. Accordingly one Day he rode with a Gang of them to the Sea-side, in order to fetch away someGoods, and brought away 200 l. of Tea upon this Horse, besides what the rest brought away.</p>

Afterwards he returned again to live with his Brother, and was employ'd in carrying smuggled Goods to Grocers and Chandlers Shops, &amp;c. as the Owners gave their Directions. But, as yet, he had never been concerned in buying or selling upon his own Account.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he went to live with a Gentleman of the Army in <placeName id="OA17490804-geo-28">

But his Brother having a mind to embark in that Trade, sent for Creed again, and by much Persuasion got him to be his Rider, as they call it, to fetch and carry run Goods, and to look after his Concerns in the smuggling Way. He had not been more than a Journey or two, he says, upon his Brother's Account, before somebody, he knows not who, informed against him; and being a very useful and busy Man in the Business, he was afterwards many Times inform'd against, so that he was now in great Danger of being apprehended. His Brother finding the Case to be so, left off dealing, and Creed had a new Master to seek. He found himself under a Necessity, he says, of continuing in the same Way; to go to Husbandry was dangerous, left he might be discovered and taken, so he thought it best to keep among them for Safety, as well as Employ, to provide Maintenance for his Wife and Children.</p>
            <p>There was at that Time a Chief of the Smugglers confined in Newgate, whose Wife, by the Assistance of Creed to manage for them, carried on the Trade during his 2 Years Imprisonment. This Man happening to get his Liberty, return'd home, and left off the Trade entirely; so Creed was once more left in the Lurch, and to seek for a Master.</p>
            <p>He now hired himself out to his original Labour with a Farmer at <placeName id="OA17490804-geo-29">

But his former Master advised him to return again to the smuggling Business, and now to encourage him, lent him Money to help him to carry on a small Trade for himself. And, he says, he has 4 or 5 several Times bought run Goods, and carried to Hawkhurst, and other Places, but such Qantities only as he might get 5 or 10 Shillings by perhaps at a time; tho' he owns he has been concern'd in running, and carrying away large Quantities for other People.</p>
            <p>At last he became Rider for one Gingles, and on the fatal Morning, the 30th of March 1747, he says, he went by his Master's Orders down to a Place on the Kentish Coast, known by the Name of the Two Sisters, (upon account of two Churches that stand near one another, suppos'd to be built by two Sisters) to do Business for him. The Folkstone Men had been there before,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174908040006"/>
            <p>and were returning Home loaden with their Booty, as Creed and his Company were going down. They met about nine o'Clock in the Morning, and got to the Place about eleven. They had been there some Time loading their Horses, not thinking of any Surprize: But on a sudden they heard a Noise of Persons above coming towards them, which proved to be some Custom House Officers, and others, whom Creed call'd the Militia of the adjacent Country. They had a Sort of an Engagement for some Time, but no Mischief ensued. The Smugglers were at last obliged to give Ground, and rode away as fast as they could, leaving their Goods behind them, which the Officers seized, being upwards of 3000 Weight of Tea. Creed was taken particular Notice of, and Information once more lodged against him, and not surrendering according to Order, he became an Outlaw. And now,</p>
            <p>He began to think of Providing for his Safety. In order thereto, thinking it best to leave the smuggling Countries, He went into <placeName id="OA17490804-geo-31">

But with all his Caution he could not escape the Search of those who have the Management of bringing such Offenders to Justice. For upon a Day as he and the Person with whom he lived were above in a Chamber together, Creed observed a Posse of People coming towards the House. His Landlord was very much alarmed, and wondered what might be the Meaning of it. But Creed says he knew at first Sight what they were come for, and accordingly told his Landlord, that he had been a Smuggler, and was outlaw'd, and these People were come to take him. So when they came to him, he says, he accosted them in this Manner</p>
            <p>"Gentlemen, you need not</p>

He was plainly proved to be the Man, as the Nature of the Case would admit, unless he had been actually detected while he was taking the Plate out of the Room. A Day or two before Execution he seem'd to take a little more Concern than before he had been wont to do, and left the Stage of the World with some seeming Marks of Contrition.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17490804n57-1" type="gender" value="male"/>

For conscious I am; and very easy in my own Mind with regard to her, as for Virtue, Honesty, Sobriety, and Industry, and I am the unhappy Man, that does say, there is but few such left behind. As for that dreadful Scene, that has happened, which I am to dye for, it did not proceed from Jealousy, as the censorious thought it did. If there was any Jealousy, it was of her Side, for I now speak before God, and my own Conscience, to whom I now must shortly appear, that I never had any Occasion to suspect her either in her Actions, Conduct or Behaviour, she never was the Woman, that ever put it in my Power, or any Persons in the World to blame her of being guilty of the least Indiscretion.</p>
            <p>The Reason of the dismal Scene happening is as follows. I have been unfortunate <rs id="OA17490804-occupation-23" type="occupation">at Sea</rs>
               <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                     targets="OA17490804n57-1 OA17490804-occupation-23"/> for these 4 Years last past, tho' I have endeavoured to the utmost of my Power. But my poor dear Wife being unacquainted with a seafaring Life, used to reflect upon me, and that it was thro' my Negligence I had no better Success. Indeed my Wife has upon Account of my Misfortunes, said that I had no Love for her, therefore told me 'twas much better to Part, which gave me more Uneasiness and Concern then I ever met in my Life before, for she was dearer to me than my own Life. After my poor Wife made use of that Expression concerning our parting, it almost put me besides myself but I have since found that it did not come from her Heart, by Reason of her hiding my Cloaths, which was to prevent my going. But I not knowing that, and hearing her talk to me in such a Manner, it put me into Confusion, which caused some Words to arise betwixt us, which was the Reason of that cursed Knife passing between us, with which I gave her the fatal Stroke; tho' God knows my Heart not with Design to take away her Life.</p>
            <p>It grieves me to think that this Accident should happen in the House of Mr. Murray, who, I am sure, both he, and his Wife are very honest People, and wished me and my Wife as well as if we had been their own Flesh and Blood; and I hope that God will reward him for the Trouble and Expence, they have been at upon both our Accounts. I now freely from the bottom of my Heart forgive them who have injured and wronged me, as I hope the Lord will forgive me at the last Day, and I beg forgiveness of all those whom I havewronged.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174908040012"/>
            <p>
            MURDER is surely a Crime of so barbarous and inhuman a Nature, that it shocks the Mind of every Person, to whose Ears the Perpetration of such a Fact does ever arrive. This is always the Case, where the Seeds of Humanity are not totally eradicated; while the Man retains any Thing within him worthy the Dignity of his Nature, and becoming the End of his Creation. If a Man commit Murder on the greatest Stranger, all Nations, even the Heathen hath condemned the Fact, and admitted the Murderer to be deserving of Death. But when a Man lays violent Hands on his Friend, his nearest and most intimate Companion, the Guilt increases with the Proximity of the Relation in the natural Notions of Men, but much more so when we have Respect to the Laws and Commands of God. Nor can there in strict Justice any Excuse be framed, that shall be of any avail in the Sight of God, whatever Man may think of the Matter. Whosoever sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed. But if the Murderer meets not his deserved Fate in this World, what Fear, left his Sufferings be intolerable in that which is to come? For whatever the Provocation may be, he is not allowed to revenge himself nor would Reason teach him so to do, but Religion absolutely forbiddeth it.</p>
            <p>Gray intimates in his Letter, that he loved his Wife, as well as his own Heart nor had she given him any Reason to think Evil of her: What then could occasion his doing so detestable a Sin? Nothing but the most extreme Degree of Madness. And this was unfortunately his Case, being overcome with Passion and Liquor, he was not himself. Had his Reason been present with him, his Love towards her would have stept in to her Assistance, and prevented the execrable Deed. If his Senses had not been overpowered, he protested several Times, he never could have been cruel enough to have hurt her. His Behaviour was very decent all the Time of his laying under Sentence of Death, even to the last, his Countenance rather chearful than dejected; and the Reason he gave for it was, that he was a Man of a pleasant, and good Humour, nor would any Body that had known him in his Days say to the contrary. He said he never had wronged Man, Woman, nor Child, to the best of his Remembrance; yet having been guilty of this most cruel Deed, he looked upon himself as a most vile Sinner, but had Hopes as it was not done with Malice and Design, as he was truely and heartily sorry for what he had done amiss in this Affair, and every other Circumstance of his Life, that God would have Mercy on him, and admit him to some Share in the Merits of Jesus Christ.</p>
