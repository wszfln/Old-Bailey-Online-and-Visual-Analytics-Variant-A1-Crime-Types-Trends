He put what Provisions he had into a coarse Osnaburgh Shirt, which he took with him for that Purpose, and took some of his Wife's Caps to make Tinder of, and two check'd Aprons to make him a Shirt. He lay by all that Day to prevent his being discover'd, and broil'd some of his Bacon, which he eat very heartily. As soon as the Day Light was shut in, he went down towards the Mouth of the River, and travelled all that Night, but could not make much Way. The next Day he lay by again, and the Night following travelled all Night long, and came to a River called Ockaquan, where there is a Ferry, but the Ferry-House was on the other Side of the River. He lay about ten Days on that Side of the River, concealed among the Bushes, which was not above ten Miles from his Master's House, during which Time he wandered about to find a Canoe to carry him over the River, in order to proceed on his Journey; and at a Smith's Shop (it being Moon-light) he happened to see an Advertisement stuck up for taking him, still he wandered up and down the River, having little or no Provisions left, and walked against the Wind to come to a Plantation, in order to get some Provisions, and got to the Milk-House adjoining to the Dwelling House, where he found a Blade Bone of Bacon, some Greens, and a Pone of English Bread made of Wheat, but it was as heavy as Lead: He filled a Cloth full of English Meal, took a Fowl out of the Hen House, and went down into a Pokosen, which is a thick Woody Place, and a wet swampy Ground near the Water Side; there he made a Fire under a Beach Tree, and eat Part of his Bacon and Bread, pick'd his Fowl and dressed it, and made his Flower into Bread and baked it, then he wandered up and down, till at last one Afternoon he saw a Man coming on Shore in a Canoe, who had been selling his Ware, and fastened the Canoe to the Stump of a Tree, and took the Paddle * away with him. He followed the Man through the Woods, till he saw he was clear off. This made the Tenth Day that he was on that Side the River, and he did design (if he had not had this Opportunity of escaping) to return to his Master, and ask his Pardon, and tell him he had attempted to make his Escape, but finding he could not do it, was resolved to continue his Servant. But this was only a Pretence, for he thought to have gone to <placeName id="OA17440608-geo-14">

The next Day, being a dull hazy Day, and no Plantation near the River, he ventured over in the Day Time, and, as it happened, undiscovered. When he came on the other Side, at a small Distance he saw some Negroes planting Tobacco, and was obliged to lie in a Parcel of prickly Thorns till Night, he not daring to stir they were so near him; then he set out again, and went to the Plantation and killed a Goose, which lasted him four Days; he still continuing to travail in the Night, and lay by in the Day, and as he went along, used to rob the Milk Houses and the Plantations.</p>

The Planter said, he would not trouble himself with him, but he was sure he would be brought back again, and so they parted. He travelled on, plundering the Milk Houses, till he came within 4 Miles of Rappahanock River. The Night being rainy, and he very wet, he got into an old Tobacco House, [he was afraid of catching an Ague and Fever, but, he said, he believed he was reserved for this Death, otherwise he does suppose he should have died there] and fell asleep between some old Cyder Casks: While he was asleep, he dreamed there was a Man came in a Great Coat with a Gun to take him, and told him he was a Runaway; and just as he awaked he saw a Man * like the other he had been dreaming of, come into the Tobacco Warehouse, with a Gun upon his Arm, and said, Hah, what do you do here? Cole said, What do you think? I was asleep if you had not wak'd me. The Man said he must get up, and come along with him. For what? said Cole; what must I go along with you for? The Man said, because he believed he was a Runaway. Cole said he was no Runaway. The Man said he looked as if he was, for he might have had Quarters at his House if he had been upon the fair Lay, [for every one may travel the Country through, without costing him a Farthing, if he has a Protection] and therefore as it was War Time, he said, he thought proper to take him before a Justice. [This was about the Time of taking Porto Bello.] There were three Negroes accidentally coming by, the Planter called to them to come up; they asked him, what was the Matter? Bryan, said he, had caught a Runaway in his Tobacco House, and they persuaded him to let him go; they said, Poor Barricado, let him go, what signifies keeping him? Bryan said, if they would not assist him to carry him before Mr. Beane, (a Justice of the Peace) he would have them flogg'd. Then Cole consented to go along with them. When they came there, Bryan told Mr. Beane, that his Boy went into the Tobacco House for a Bit of Tobacco, and seeing a Man lying asleep, was frightened out of his Wits, and came and acquainted him with it; upon which he took his Gun and secured him, and had brought him before him, to advise with him what to do. What I would have you do, said Mr. Beane, why you may see he is a Runaway. Mr. Beane said he would send him down to Naylor's-Hole, to Captain Fantleroy. Said Cole, What must I do there? Said </p>

            <p>the Justice, He will send you to Goal, and you shall be kept there till your Master comes to own you. Then said Cole, He may keep me there a thousand Years, for I have no Master in the World. Justice Beane said, he did not know whether he had or not, but he would keep him five Court Days, and if he was not owned then, the Sheriff should order him to be sold for four Years as a Runaway.</p>
            <p>COLE said, this was a hard Case, for he had a Wife and Children in the Country; but he could not say, but that he was a Run-away from one Thing, for he had run a way from a Doctor's Bill, for killing his Wife and two Children, [if a Man cannot pay his Debts, they will sell him for a Slave till those Debts are paid] Then the Justice said, let him go about his Business; then Cole went to Bryan's House, and he advised him to go into the Army (for they were then raising Soldiers to go to the Island of Cuba) and that he would give him a Direction to go to a Gentleman in <persName id="OA17440608n33-1">

Cole told him, he heard there were pressing Times in England, and that he would rather go into the Land-Service. Bryan said, God bless you, do just as you will, and so they parted. Cole went on his Journey, and before he was well got out of Sight of Bryan's House, he met a Land Captain, who was raising Recruits: Said Cole, I suppose he was one who had killed a Rattle-Snake, and they had made him a Captain for so doing; then Cole returned again, and made the best of his Way to Naylor's-Hole, where there was a Ship lying; he went on Board her, and asked if they wanted a Jobber; they told him they did not want any, but directed him to Captain Loney, who asked him several Questions, because he had heard of an Advertisement, of such a Person running away from his Master; but he told him, he came from Mr. Boyd, in Puttuxent-River; then the Captain told him, he would give him six Pounds for the run Home; upon which, he hired himself to him; when he came to England, he was press'd out of Captain Loney's &#8224; Ship, into the Scarborough Man of War, Captain Wm. Lisle, Commander, where he remained till he had an Opportunity to be sent up in a press'd Man's Room; and he was soon after, sent up in a New England Man; then he went to the Regulating Captain in Mark-Lane, and got a Ticket with an Order to go to the Clerk of the Cheque at Deptford, to receive fifteen Shillings Conduct-Money, in order to carry him down to the Scarborough, at Plymouth, or elsewhere; and then went on Board Captain Loney's Ship to receive his Wages, which were paid to him; and instead of going to his Majesty's Ship the Scarborough, he run away from the Service, (this was in September 1740) and then he fell into Company with some of his old Companions, and fell again into his former wicked Course of Life.</p>

He said the Shutters were worn at the Bottom, that they could easily raise them up, or push them on one Side, and wondered that People should be so negligent and dilatory in not getting their Shutters mended, and keeping the Grooves better secured at the Ends.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Thing he blames Shopkeepers for, especially Linnen-Drapers, is for letting large Quantities of valuable Goods lie close to the Window Shutters, so that they may be taken out with their Hands: This must be owing to the Negligence of Masters or Servants, or for Fear of a little Trouble in moving their Goods at Night.</p>

            <p>" I CANNOT doubt, but among You, there " are a great many that knows me, and knows " that I came of honest Parents. Undutifulness " to them has brought me to this untimely End. " Drunkenness and lewd Women, debauch'd " Campany and Sabbath-breaking, were the " Forerunners of a Life of unparallell'd Wickness for many Years, with Shame I may speak " it. I cannot doubt but what there are a great " many here, now in Sight of me, that are still " pursuing the same Ways, and if not timely " prevented, will shortly be over-taken by the " Hand of Justice; though I hope in God, that " this my fatal End, will be a Warning to them " all. I hope, that I have made my Peace " with God, through the Merits of Jesus Christ, " in whom I trust. I humbly beg Pardon of all " People I have wrong'd in any Case whatever, " even those who have prosecuted me to my " Death. I freely forgive all Mankind, as I " hope to be forgiven, and die in Peace and " Charity with all the World, and an unworthy " Member of the Church of England. I beg " the Prayers of all good Christian People for " my poor Soul, that is just going to launch into " Eternity, and beg that none will reflect upon " my Wife nor Friends, who were no ways " concerned in the means of my Ruin. I own " my Sentence to be very Just.</p>

            <p>AS the Persons to whom these Papers relate were repriev'd, we think it requisite to give some Account of the Publication of their Contents. They were taken with all the Caution imaginable, in respect to the Truths they contain, and are sent abroad purely out of regard to Public Good. The Execution of Offenders would be of little Service to the Society, consider'd barely as removing so many Malefactors, the Benefit expected from it arises from the Example, or rather the Effects of the Example; this the Law seeks, and this is principally sought by the rendering these Papers public; and this surely must be therefore esteemed a Reason sufficient.</p>
            <p>IT will manifestly appear from this Account, that a good Education, and the greatest Tenderness and Care of Parents, have very little Share in restraining young People of a vicious Disposition, and therefore this ought to incline such as have the Direction of Youths, who discover a Propensity to bad Courses, to lay aside an illtim'd Affection, which serves only to thtow them in the Way of Temptation, and to apply an effectual Remedy, by either putting them to a laborious Business with a proper Master, or sending them out of the Road of ill Company, 'till they arrive at Discretion enough to avoid it themselves.</p>
            <p>BESIDES this, the Magistrate, from these Accounts, may be led to observe, that the Wickedness, which is so much complain'd of, arises in a Manner wholly from the Tolleration, some Way or other, of infamous Houses, in which young People are corrupted, plung'd into Debaucheries, and then turn'd out to rob, thieve, or pick Pockets, in order to support them. These Houses are the Sources of the Fullness of Goals, and the Frequency of Executions, and therefore to remove them, would be found the most certain Means to prevent those, towards which it is hoped the Publication of these Papers, and the remarkable Facts contained in them, may, in some Measure, contribute.</p>

When he was of an Age proper to be sent to School, his Parents put him to one of the best in Edinburgh, where he made a very great Progress in his Learning, so that he was Master of the Latin and Greek Tongues. After he had left this School, and his Father thought him fit for some Trade, he gave him an Offer to make Choice of what Business best suited with his Inclinations. He being of a roving Disposition, was not willing to settle to any Manner of Trade; and accordingly he acquainted his Father, that his Humour led him to go to Sea. Upon which his Father not being willing to put him to any thing against his Will, for Fear of the ill Consequences that might attend it, he being of an obstinate Temper, bound him Apprentice to a Captain of a Ship in the Coal Trade, to which he served his Time, and that to the entire Satisfaction of his Master; his Behaviour being so just and agreeable, that the two last Years of his Time, his Master made him <rs id="OA17440608-occupation-6" type="occupation">Mate of the same Ship</rs>

Ugon that he got two Persons to join Company with him, and between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock at Night, they ran away with the Long Boat, and went to one of the Branches of <placeName id="OA17440608-geo-48">

            <p>AFTERWARDS a small Sloop came from Bermudas, that had a Mate and one Hand wash'd over-board, consign'd to the Planter where Rochead and his Companions were. While Rochead remained in the Planter's House, he behaved himself so well, that the Planter recommended it to the Master of the Sloop to take Rochead, and make him his Mate; upon which, on the Character given by the said Planter, he made him his Mate, and likewise took his two Companions into his Service. The Sloop being loaded with Tobacco, the fell down the River, and came to an Anchor, where the Captain and one Man, with a Boy, went on Shore to buy fresh Provisions for the Voyage to the West-Indies. In the mean Time Rochead, with the rest of the Ship's Company, got drunk, and while in that Condition, they consulted to run away with the Sloop, and accordingly cut the Cable, and taking the Advantage of a Moonlight Night, put to Sea, and steer'd their Course for the West-Indies, he being allow'd, by all that know him, to be a very good Sailor, and so accomplished an Artist, as to be capable of conducting a Ship to any Part of the World. The first Land they fell in with after seven Weeks Passage, was the Island of Qualifa-Quaw *, where, in Sight of the Land, they appointed him Master of the Sloop, and he at the same Time made one of his Companions, who had made his Escape with him on board the Anne Galley, Mate. Putting into the Harbour, he went on Shore, and got acquainted with a Merchant, who came to see his Cargoe, he at the same Time, declared to the Merchant, that the Ship and Cargoe were his own, and likewise took upon him the Name of Captain Ellis, which was the Name of the Master they had left behind at <placeName id="OA17440608-geo-49">

            <p>THERE being three Negroes on board the said Sloop, Rochead promised them their Liberty, if they would not betray him, but he not keeping his Word, but selling them to a Jew, after he had sold them, one of the Negroes discover'd the whole Affair. Upon this he was taken up with three other Men, and committed to Goal, and his new Mate turn'd Evidence against him. Rochead continued in Goal, till they received News from Virginia, in order to confirm the Mates's Evidence, which was near Thirteen Months; and the first News they received was, that <persName id="OA17440608n93-1">

            <p>SOME small Time after, being on Shore, he had an Opportunity of shipping himself for London as Boatswain, and had Twenty five Guineas for the Run Home. Upon his coming to Town, and with that Money, he equipp'd himself after a very handsome Manner; and one Day being in Company with a young Woman, he fell in Love with her, and made his Addresses to her, and after a few Months Courtship gained her Consent, and was married to her, and she proved a virtuous Woman, by whom he had one Child.</p>
            <p>HIS Money being all spent, he then shipp'd himself Mate of a Collier, where he continued several Voyages, and his Behaviour was very well approved off by the Owners; but there being an Order from the Admiralty, that no Person belonging to any Ship coming on Shore without their Protection, should be exempt from being press'd; and as he was found on Shore without his Protection, he was accordingly Impress'd, and carried on Board his Majesty's Ship The Cumberland, under the Command of Commodore James Stuart, as a Foremast Man; but having some Friends, through the Interest of his late Father, he was made Midshipman. The Ship falling down to the Nore, there were three 80 Gun Ships to be mann'd, viz. The Torbay, Cambridge, and Chichester, which lay at Sheerness; on which Rochead was turn'd over on Board The Cambridge, under the Captain Thomas Wharwood, who being compleatly mann'd, he immediately ail'd to Spithead.</p>
            <p>SOMETIME after, there being an Order for a secret Expedition, under the Command of <persName id="OA17440608n98-1">
                  <interp inst="OA17440608n98-1" type="gender" value="male"/>

                  <interp inst="OA17440608n98-1" type="given" value="JOHN"/>Sir John Norris</persName>, the Fleet sailed to the Westward, with the Cambridge in Company, and meeting with some Gales of Wind to the Westward, the Fleet return'd to Spithead: Then sometime after their Arrival, Captain Wharwood was by order of the Lords of the Admiralty, made Captain of the Neptune, a Ship of 90 Guns; and upon Rochead's late good Behaviour, in the Cambridge, the Captain made him Master's Mate of the above Ship.</p>
            <p>SOME short Time after, Lieutenant Harrison and Rochead, were order'd to keep a Rendezvous at London, to impress, and enter Men for his Majesty's Service, which was kept at the Golden-Lion near Wapping Stairs; the Man who keeps the House is one Henry Ingester, where he continued for about six Months. After he had continued there some Time, an Order came down from the Regulating Captain, to break up the Rendezvous, which was accordingly done. The Lieutenant order'd the Gang to go on Board a Tender, which was ordered for Scotland, to impress Men; the Tender lying near Wapping-Stairs, the Crew consisted of sixteen Hands on Board, the chief Command of which, was given to Rochead, by order of the Lieutenant; Rochead at that Time, being short of Money, discharg'd the Impress'd Men, on a valuable Consideration, which Practice he follow'd for about three Weeks, 'l the Orders for Victualling and Manning the Tender for a sufficient Compliment of Men, came down by Lieutenant Scroop; accordingly they repair'd to the Neptune, which was victualled at Chatham.</p>
            <p>FROM whence they proceeded for a three Months Cruize, to enter and impress Men both by Land and Sea; and arriving at Leith, Rochead had once more the Opportunity of seeing his Father and Mother, and likewise his Brother, who is now a Distiller in Edinburgh; when his Father saw him, he received him with a great deal of Tenderness, as likewise did his Mother and Brother; before he took Leave of his Father, he furnished him with Cloaths, Books, &amp;c. to the Value of forty Pounds, or upwards. The Cruize being near out, and meeting with pretty good Success, they return'd to the Neptune Man of War at Chatham; and he obtaining Leave from the Captain to come up to London, he got acquainted with some lewd Women of the Town; and he not being able to supply their Extravagancies, he took the following Method; which was, by procuring four or five People to impress Men on the River Thames in the Night-time, under false Pretensions, and thereby extort several Sums of Money from them; he at that Time pretended he was a Lieutenant, so by this villainous Way of proceeding, he got a pretty parcel of Money. The very last Night of his Expedition, a Captain of one of the Ships that he extorted Money from, happened to know him,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174406080014"/>
            <p>and upon Application to the Regulating Captains, he acquainted them who Rochead was; they applied to the Lords of the Admiralty, and thereupon Warrants were issued out for taking him; and one Lieutenant Nowel, having a proper Warrant for apprehending him, as he was going along Rotherith, met with him by Chance, and some of the Gang belonging to the Lieutenant, knowing him, he was immediatelyy taken, and put on Board the Tender, then lying at Tower Wharf.</p>
            <p>THE next Day the Regulating Captains sitting, found Rochead to be the very Person, who made it his Business to impress Persons, under false Pretensions, and likewise to extort Sums of Money from them for their Discharge; upon which, they apply'd to the Lords of the Admiralty, to know how to Proceed against him; and their Lordships Commands were, to commit him to the Marshalsea, which was done accordingly, where he continued in Irons for above five Months. An Alteration being made in the Lords of the Admiralty, and Brigadier General Sinclair knowing his Father, made Interest for him to be sent on Board the Lark Man of War, under the Command of Captain Waring. Some small Time before his Commitment to the Marshalsea, he became acquainted with <persName id="OA17440608n102-2">

While his pretended Wife was on Board, they both laid a Scheme for his Escape, which, by her procuring a Bomb Boat, was compleated about twelve o'Clock that Night, viz. One of the Lieutenants coming on Board that Night about Ten, with Orders from the Captain to get every Thing clear'd and ready for sailing, the Governor being to come on Board next Morning, and calling for the Mate of the Watch, it happening at that Time to be Rochead's Turn to have the first Watch, which was to be between the Hours of Eight and Twelve; upon which, he was ordered to get the Accommodation Ladder out, and see the Viol all clear, for heaving in the best Bower Cable. Then the Lieutenant, with some other of the Officers, went to sleep, leaving Rochead as Officer of the Watch, with two Midshipmen, and other Persons proper, viz. Four Quarter-Masters, and one Boatswain's Mate, beside four Centinels. Rochead expecting the Bomb-boat to come off every Moment, as was agreed between him and his Wife; for fear of being Discover'd, he made the petty Officers and the Watch drunk; in the mean Time, the Bombboat came hankering before the Bow; upon his seeing her, Rochead pretending to be in a violent Passion, cry'd out, D - n you, what are you doing here?

Money being so very short, and neither of them having any thing to subsist on, she told him one Evening, that he must Turn out, for she could not maintain him any longer, for she had not a proper Dress to appear in as usual. Upon which, he replied, he would do any Thing in Life to support her, nay, venture his Neck, rather than she should want for any Thing.</p>

Accordingly she gave her Word she would not. Then he immediately confessed he had robbed her, and at the same Time told her that all her Things were at his Lodgings at Islington, except the half Dozen of Spoons which he had pawned; accordingly she sent proper Persons along with him to his Lodgings at Islington, where they found all the Gentlewoman's Things, except the aforesaid half Dozen of Spoons, which she fetched out of Pawn, and thereupon discharg'd him.</p>

            <p>AFTER this Robbery he went to Macmullin's, from whence he and Mooney, with one Tool, since executed at Long-Reach, on Board his Majesty's Ship Antelope, for Desertion, went to Cleaver's House, where Cleaver sold his working Tools to find Money for himself, Tool and Mooney to go down to Portsmouth, to raise Contributions on the Road; whereupon they hired three Horses in the Borough on a Sunday, pretending only to go for a Day's Pleasure, and pursuing their intended Journey, when they all three came as far as Ripley, they met with two Lieutenants of Men of War, and swore if they did not stand, they would blow their Brains out; one of them drew his Sword, and swore he would run them through; upon which Mooney rid up to him, and fired a Pistol, which took off the Corner of his Hat, then they surrendered; they took from them about nine Pounds in Money, one gold Watch and a silver one; a small Sword and an Hanger, and also two double Dubloons; this being about seven o'Clock in the Evening; after they had committed this Robbery, they all three rode to the White Hart at Guilford, where they lay that Night.</p>
            <p>NEXT Morning between nine and ten, they robbed a Gentleman (who said he belonged to General Honeywood's Regiment) upon the Heath, half way between <placeName id="OA17440608-geo-100">

Afterwards they avoided the Portsmouth Road, for fear of being pursued, and took a quite contrary Road, till they came to Winchester, where they staid that Night, and the next Day went to Gosport, without doing any thing. Upon their Arrival, they put their Horses up at <placeName id="OA17440608-geo-102">

One Evening as they were drinking, at the Blue-Anchor, one Captain Farmer, happening to be in their Company, they saw him receive between forty and fifty Pounds, after he had staid about half an Hour, he paid his Reckoning and took leave of his Company; he had not been gone long, before Cleaver and his two Companions follow'd him, and overtook him at about half Way to his own House, which was at a Place called Stoke; then Cleaver with a Pistol in his Hand, stepped up to him, and begged the Favour of him to lend him that Sum of Money, which he saw him receive about two Hours ago, in such a Place; for he said, he thought he appeared a more creditable Person, than the Persons he had lent it to; and if he disputed his Word and Honour, he wou'd give him his Bond; upon which the Captain reply'd he did not know him, and said, at the same Time, it was a very unreasonable Request for a Stranger to ask Mooney upon this stepped up, and said, D - n my Blood do you know me, will you lend it to me? at the same Time clapping a Pistol to his Breast, swearing if he denied, he would have his Life; Sir said the Captain, take away your Pistol, and you shall have my Money, he being a long time pulling it out, Tool stepped up and said, God D - n my Blood, why are you so long about so small a Trifle, shoot the old Rogue; upon which Cleaver reply'd, the old Man is doing it as fast as he can, and I will help him, and when they had got the Money, Cleaver shook Hands with him, and wished him good Night. Then they all three returned and took their Horses, and that Night they made the best of their Way to Southampton, and put up their Horses at the Spread-Eagle, and about five o'Clock the next Morning, they went in Pursuit of fresh Adventures towards <placeName id="OA17440608-geo-103">

Cleaver said, come don't be ill-natured, let us see how much Money you have got, turn all your Pockets out, we won't distress you; upon which he pulled out a green Purse with nine Guineas</p>

Cleaver rode up to Tool and reprimanded him for using the Gentleman so ill; and said at the same Time, if the Gentleman knew of our coming, he would have been better provided. The Gentleman recovering himself from the Blow which he received, he made one at Tool, saying he was a Villain, but the other was a Gentleman, (meaning Cleaver) upon which Tool returning the Blow, knocked him off his Horse, and he crying out Murder, some People coming by, among them were two Colliers, which Cleaver and Mooney both fired at, and Cleaver happening to shoot one of the Colliers into the Shoulder; more coming to their Assistance, they rode off, and Cleaver's Horse falling he was taken, and committed to Newgate in Bristol, the Gentleman robbed swearing to him; he had not been confined but about five Days, before he made his Escape. Money being very short with him, he was obliged to beg his Way to London. When he came there he went immediately to his old Friend Grace Macmullins; where he met with his two Companions Mooney and Tool, and he falling out with them, about their leaving him, and very high Words rising they parted. Mooney immediately after this, entered into a new Gang, was soon after taken and executed; and a little Time afterwards Tool was taken and hang'd on Board the Antelope as above mentioned.</p>

He had not lodged above five Days at the House, before he took all Opportunities to observe where the Money lay; having no proper Tools for his Purpose, he came to London, and went to his old Lodging for proper Instruments, then he returned back to his Lodgings at Chelsea, and when the People of the House were pretty Busie, he went up Stairs, and opened a Chest with the Instrument which he brought with him, and took out in Money to the amount of about 16 l. and immediately came to London. Being obliged to abscond upon an Account of this Robbery, he went to Rotherhith, where he became acquainted with Rochead, who is now his Fellow Prisoner on the Common-side of Newgate, and were both under Sentence of Death, for the Robberies committed by them on Tower-Hill; but have received his Majesty's Reprieve to be transported for fourteen Years.</p>
