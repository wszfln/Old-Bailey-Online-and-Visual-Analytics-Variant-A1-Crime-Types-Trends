            <p>On Wednesday the 3d of May, upon some Words between Toon and Blastock's Wife, he attempted to strike her, which Blastock understanding, reprimanded and threatened Toon very sharply,-blaming him for his Misfortunes, and telling him withal, if it were not for his present Circumstances, which obliged him to refrain from Passion, he would trample him under his Feet, as an insignificant, worthless Wretch: This frightened Toon into Silence. Upon Monday, the 22d of May, the Brothers in Law took the Sacrament together privately, in a very devout Manner, both of them, especially Blastock, who cried most bitterly, and in token of perfect Reconciliation, embraced Toon in a friendly Manner. Blastock was inconsolable, on Account of his Wife and two Children; but he was told, that God is a Husband to the Widow, and a Father to the Fatherless. He once had a good Character, and had been trusted with Things of great Value. He confessed himself to have been too much addicted to Company, Drinking, Swearing, and other Vices, and expressed a strong Confidence of God's Mercy through Christ.</p>
            <p>At first he only acknowledged the one Robbery he was convicted of, but after the Report was made, and he had no further Hopes of Life, he owned two more, which he said were all the Robberies he had committed. He often owned that he was a very great Sinner, ut hoped that God would forgive him. He believed in Christ; sincerely repented of all his Sins; and died in Peace with all the World.</p>

            <p>stock to go with him on the Highway: He agreed, and they were both of them taken up and suffered from the same Fact.</p>
            <p>Toon was a very wild, extravagant Youth, sometimes he lived in the City with some of his Friends, and worked at his Business; at other Times he took Lodgings toward the other End of the Town, and lived upon what he could plunder from others.</p>
            <p>At first he would own no more than the Robbery of which he was convicted; but when all Hopes of Life were gone, he confessed that he had committed a great Number of Robberies, and that he had been too much engaged in those Courses.</p>
            <p>He was very averse to make any Confession, and when I first spoke to him, he would scarce hear or speak any Thing, but ran abruptly out of the Closet down Stairs, though at other Times he behaved well, and at Prayers and Exhortations he behaved with too much Indifference and Hard-heartedness.</p>
            <p>I reproved him sharply for cursing and swearing at Mrs. Blastock, his Sister-in-Law, and at another Time for crying out and swearing from the Cell Window, when there was no Occasion for it.</p>
            <p>He acknowledged his Fault, begg'd Pardon of God and Man, and faithfully promised not to do the like in Time to come. He acknowledged that he was a very profligate disgraceful Person, but hoped that God would have Mercy on his poor Soul. He believed in our Saviour Christ, as the Son of God, and only Saviour of Sinners. He declared himself penitent for all, but particularly the heinous scandalous Sins of his Life, for which he died; he forgave all Injuries, as he expected Forgiveness from God.</p>
            <p>At the PLACE of EXECUTION.</p>
            <p>ABOUT nine o'Clock, in the Morning they were brought out of Newgate, and convey'd to Tyburn in two Carts, viz. Goulding, Ifield, and Margets, in the first Cart: Mr. Blastock the Highwayman, and Lawrence, for inlisting Men into Foreign Service, in the second Cart: Tinman and Murray were drawn on a Sledge for Coining: Mr. Toon went in a Mourning Coach, attended by a Clergyman belonging to Cripplegate Parish; he and Mr. Blastock having two Hearses to attend their Bodies. When they came to the Place of Execution, those who came in the first Cart were immediately tyed up; those who came in the second Cart were tyed up next, and after them the two Coiners; then Mr. Toon who came in a Mourning Coach was brought into the Cart, and as the Executioner was fastening his Halter, he desired him to tye him as nigh as he could conveniently to his Brother-in-law, Mr. Blastock. As soon as he was tyed up, he kissed his Brother-in-law, and desired that he might dye in Peace with him and all the World. Before the Cart drew off, I prayed by them for a considerable Time. Mr. Blastock behaved with the utmost Calmness and serenity of Mind; and they all appeared very devout and serious both at Prayers and singing of Psalms: Murray and Tinman were of the <rs id="OA17380526-occupation-23" type="occupation">Romish Communion</rs>

After I had left them, they desir'd the Clergyman who went with Mr. Toon, to pray by them, which he did for some Time; and just before the Cart drew away, Mr. Toon once more saluted Mr. Blastock. They all went off the Stage, Praying to God for Mercy, and cried to the Lord Jesus Christ to receive their Spirits.</p>
            <p>N. B.

But being kept so strict during my Apprenticeship, and having my Liberty all at once, and so much Indulgence from all my Customers, that it quite ruin'd me; for if I could have the Happiness to have behaved in the same Manner, when I was for myself, as I did when I was an Apprentice, I might have saved in a few Years, a moderate Fortune for my Wife and Children; but on the contrary, keeping too much Company, and taking too much Pleasure in Life, made me forget myself, neglect my Business, and thereby affront the best Friends I had in the World; and instead of saving Money, run behind Hand. And in short, in four or five Years I left the Business quite off, by Reason I had made my Friends my Enemies, and therefore could not get Bread to support my Family.</p>

            <p>Now as this was my great Misfortune, to slight so great an Opportunity, of Life, I thought it proper to let it be known, hoping it might save others who may have the same Opportunity from falling into the same Misfortune that I have done, and I hope my Misconduct may prove advantageous to others; and take this Advice from me: Let every Man in Trade be careful of disobliging their Friends and Benefactors by their Carelessness, for a Friend is soon lost, but not so soon recover'd again. I speak this by woeful Experience, having disobliged one of the best of Friends and Masters, who was so good to offer a Maintenance for Life, since my Business fail'd, and still I was so unhappy to refuse it, thinking I could do better, but I found my Error, when it was too late; and for some Years past, to support my Family, I have got my Bread in the Capacity of a PLAYER, travelling the Countries, and by God's great Providence have supported my Family, without injuring any Man, till this late Act of Parliament was made. Exposed to many Dangers, and as my Family was large, I thought it more secure to come to Town, and seek my Bread in, and accordingly came to Town in December last; and the Season being far spent at both the Play-Houses, I thought it wou'd be of no Purpose to make my Application there, and having laid by my Trade for some Time, them that was my Acquaintance told me, it was impossible for me to stick to my Business now; so in short, found all Attempts frustrated, so with this ill Success, and some other Afflictions together, it threw me into a Fit of Sickness, which render'd me incapable of doing any Thing for my poor Wife and Children.</p>
            <p>But I should have told the Reader, that for about six Months before I came to Town, that Toone, my Brother-in-Law, used to come frequently into the Country to see me, and told me his Way of Living; shewing me several Things of Value, which he had got upon the Road; and wou'd often say, I had no Heart, or else I wou'd bear him Company; but so far from complying with his Proposals, that I advis'd him to desist from such vile Practices, and told him how many Dangers he was exposed to, and what the Consequence wou'd be. So when he found I did not like his Proceedings, then he waved the Discourse; and sometimes I had Business in Town, and then I us'd to go and see my Brother-in-Law and his Wife, and after some Discourse, they both wou'd never fail telling me what Success he had; and that if I would agree to go with him, we might make ourselves. But I always told them, that as long as I could support my Family honestly, I wou'd never do any such Thing; nor they never could prevail upon me to do any such Thing, till I came to Town for good; where having lain long sick, and being out of all manner of Business, which oblig'd my poor Wife to make away with all our Things to subsist with; nay, at last, we was reduced so low, that I often used to take a Book of Three-pence or Four-pence Value, to sell to buy Bread for us and our Children; during which Misery, this Toone, my Brother-in-Law, used often to come and see me, telling me, that two Men might make a Booty that would put me into a way of Business to do for myself; to which evil Council, and the Extremity I then suffer'd, and hoping to get a Sum to put me in a Way to support my unhappy Wife and Children from starving; with dreadful Imprecations on both Sides, never to tell of each other, if either should be taken, I gave Consent to make the fatal Trial, and so he gave me Money to hire two Horses, which I did, and on Saturday the 25th of February, about 12 o'Clock, we took Horse at the <placeName id="OA17380526-geo-63">

Nay, not above six Minutes before our Trial came on, he came to me again, nd before a whole yard full of People, threw is Arms about my neck, kiss&#8217;d me again, and crying all the while, with repeated Oaths, That he wou&#8217;d save me; which he might have done, by declaring that I was notthe Man; for his declaring before he was try&#8217;d, that I was noe the person, together with People I had to my Character, must have sav&#8217;d me ; and instead of that, the Moment he came before the judge, he pleaded GUILTY.</p>
            <p>And now I leave the World to judge, if I have not been most barbarously us&#8217;d on all Sides ; not that I pretend to excuse myself in the Thing I did; but as my Life could be of no Service to him, but might ave been a Warning to me for the future, I can&#8217;t see what could induce him to behave in the Manner he dod, which God forgive him, and every Body that has done me any Harm ; and I hope every Body will forgive me, that I have done any Injury to.</p>
            <p>I should not have made the Word acquainted with this unhappy Affair, but in hopes that my Misfourtunes might prevent some other young Men from falling into the Calamities ; and let my sad Example advise you in this Point, never let any Man in Trade be below his Business, or slight his Friends that will serve him. But purchase Wisdom at my Cost, and never refuse a good Opportunity, as by woeful Experience I have done.</p>
            <p>The next Thing is never to trust your Life in the Hands of the nearest Relation ; for Money will make your dearest Friend, your greatest Enemy ; and thirdl, never be tempted with Oaths and Protestations, to do any Thing you may be sorry for afterwards, for there is no Sincerity in idle Imprecations ; sooner take a Man&#8217;s Word alone, for those that will Swear, will Lie. Not but I believe there is a great many in the World who would suffer the worst of Deaths, sooner than betray their Trust.</p>
            <p>And what I have here declared, as I am a dead Man, I protest to God is true ; and here before God and the World, I freely forgive them, and die in Peace with all the World. And humbly implore Forgiveness of that merciful God, who has promis&#8217;d Pardon to all those that Repent, and I hope that I did my Endeavour while I was alive, during my Confinement, to make my Peace with God ; and hope, the Moment I leave this vexatious and painful Lige, thro&#8217; the Merits of Jesus Christ, I hope my Soul will be receiv&#8217;d into everlasting Happiness. So I conclude with my Prayer for the Welfare of my poor unhappy Wife and Children, and all Relations, taking a long Farewel of this World, I humbly commit my Spirit into the Hands of him that gave me Being.</p>

            <p>The Want of Money, and the Sense of the bad Situation of Toon&#8217;s Affairs, occasioned Words between him and Blastock ; he reproached, Blastock with having been an Occasion of some extraordinary Expence to him ; and Blastock recriminated upon him, and laid open to him all his Follies. These mutual Upbraidings ended on their Separation ; Blastock came to <placeName id="OA17380526-geo-90">

            <p>Upon breaking up house-keeping he and his Wife came to Towm, and now his Necessities put him upon taking illicit Courses. His Friends were disobliged, his Money was spent, his Wants were great, and how to supply them was the great and difficult Question. In this Distress, and with empty Pockets, he was one Day sauntring up cheapside, where he met his Brother the Dyer in <placeName id="OA17380526-geo-92">
                  <interp inst="OA17380526-geo-92" type="type" value="street"/>

She received him very kindly, treated him with Wine, and made very much of him ; before he went away, he happened to go into the Dye-House, where observing a person to inspect the Work, he enquir&#8217;d of the Workmen who he was? They told him the Gentlemen was his Brother&#8217;s Book-Keeper ; this made his Resentment rife.</p>
            <p>He was assured that his Brother knew his Poverty and Distress, and he was well acquainted with his ill Success at Sheffield, and with his Capacity of serving him in the Quality of a Clerk, as he knew he could write a</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173805260016"/>
            <p>very good land, and understood Accompts perfectly well. He was Provoked that a Stranger should live genteely under him, while he, his own Brother, equally capable of serving him, was neglected and wanted Bread ; forgetting that the whole Course of his Behaviour had given sufficient Reason to all his Friends, and to those who knew him best, to avoid him.</p>
            <p>He resolved to supply his present Necessities at his Brother&#8217;s Expence before he left the House, and an Opportunity offered immediately, for returning from the Dye-House to his Sister in the Dinning-Room, She asked him to stay to Dinner, telling him his Brother would not dine at Home that Day. He thank&#8217;d her, and agreed to stay ; she told him he should be very welcome, and desired him to excuse her while she stepped up stairs to dress herself; while she was dressing herself, he resolv&#8217;d to put his Design in Execution, and accordingly he stripped the Beauset of 46 or 47 Ounces of Plate, which he carried out of the House immediately, and having melted it down, he sold it to one P-ce in Turn-again-Lane, for 5 Shillings and Three-Half-pence or Two-pence per Ounce.</p>
            <p>Having committed this Robbery upon his Brother, he knew all his Expectations of Relief from Relations, must cease, and looking upon himself as in a State of Enmity with all Mankind, he resolved to support himself with what he could plunder from them ; and no sooner was the Money gone which he had made of his Plate, but turned upon the Highway, and commited many Robberies upon the Epping Road.</p>
            <p>The first Time he went out he waited a considerable Time for a Booty, and rode backwads and forwards so often before any Opportunity offer&#8217;d, that both his Horse and himself were tired ; however, as he had no more than one penny in his Pocket, and his Neccessities press&#8217;d hard, he was resolv&#8217;d not to leave the Forrest till he had supply&#8217;d himself ; accordingly having got Sight of a Coach coming form Ld. Castlemain&#8217;s, between three and four in the Afternoon, he over-took it, and (with a bare Face and without any disguise) ordered the Coachman to stop, threatning to shoot him through the Head if he refused. Two Ladies who were in the Coach, were very much terrified upon being attack&#8217;d Pistol in Hand, but he endeavour&#8217;d to remove their Apprehensions of Danger and to pacify them, by assuring them that he would not hurt their Persons, but as he was an unfortunate young Man, and had spent his Forune, he must make bold with their Money, Watches and Rings. From one of them he took a Guinea, five shillings in Silver, and a Half Guinea, a Tweezer-case, and a Girdle-buckle set with Stones ; where they bid their Watches he could not tell, for he could find neither of them, tho&#8217; he plainly saw their Equipages. When he had got what he could from them, he wished them a good Night, and well to Town, and was over-joy&#8217;d when he thought what a Booty he had got, resolving, as he had come safely off that Time, that he would never Turn out again.</p>
            <p>As soon as he got to Town he sent for a confident of his (with whom he had entrusted the Knowledge of his Design) the Contents of the Booty were examined, but to his great Mortification, the Tweezer-Case prov&#8217;d only Base-Metal, and the Stones in the GirdleBuckle were but Chrystal ; however, upon offering them to pawn he got five shillings for the Twezeer-Cases, Seven and Six-pence upon the Buckle.</p>
            <p>Necessity soon urg&#8217;d him to break thro&#8217; his Resolution of not venturing again upon the Road, and in a very short Time he went out again to reconnitre the <placeName id="OA17380526-geo-93">

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173805260017"/>
            <p>his Pistol, demanded his Money ; the Gentleman very merrily desired him to put that nasty disagreeable Thing out of the Way, and he would give him what he had about him. He put up the Pistol at his Request, then the Gentleman gave him between 30 and 40 s. and sfter mutual Complements they parted. This Person he imagin&#8217;d was a Banker in Lombard-street.</p>
            <p>Another Time he robb&#8217;d one Mr. Currier, a Money-Scrivener (who is since dead) upon the same Road, of three Guineas. This Money he got with some Difficulty, for Mr. Currier, before he parted his Money, expostulated with him, telling him what Danger attended such Courses. He thanked him for his Advice, which he said was very good, and he was very sensible of his own Danger, therefore he must be the more expeditious, and must not trifle with him, for notwithstanding the Danger, Money he wanted, and Money he must have, and the Danger of the Course he was engaged in, obliged him to tell him, that is he was not quick in Delivering, he would shoot him through the Body. Upon his presenting the Piston, Mr, Currier gave him 3 Guineas, and he wished him a good Night, and rode off.</p>
            <p>Another Time he robbed a Gentleman on the same Road of his Money and a Gold Watch. The Watch he entrusted with his Friend P-ce, in Turn-again-Lane, to dispose of for him ; but it being advertised, and a handsome Reward offer&#8217;d, no Questions ask&#8217;d, Toon ordered Pce to carry the Watch according to the Directions in the Advertisement. He did so, and the Gentleman paid eight Guineas upon the Delivery of his Watch. P-ce returned to Toon with seven, telling chap. Toon told him &#8216;twas very well, and had so much Confidence in P-ce&#8217;s Honesty, that he entrusted him with the Disposal of all he got, till he found out that p-ce cheated him.</p>
            <p>For being again upon the same Road in Quest of Prey, and having spent a great many Hours without meeting a Booty, he turned in at Mr. Bays&#8217;s, the <placeName id="OA17380526-geo-94">

He sat in a Publick Room among a great deal of Company, and among the rest he observed the Footman who was behind he Coach when the robb&#8217;d his Masters of the Gold Watch.</p>
            <p>Some People in the Room were talking of Robberies lately committed in that Road ; upon which the Footman gave an exact Account of this very Robberu, and of what his Master had lost ; but, says he, my Master has got his Watch again (which Toon knew very well) for (says he) my Master advertised it, and a Man brought it to him again, and delivered it to him, upon his paying 8 Guineas. Toon hearing this, took the first Opportunity to reproach P-ce with Sishonesty, and this was the Occasion of his disposing of what he got in another Manner for the future.</p>
            <p>The day he robb&#8217;d Mr. Seabrook was his Birth Day : He was then just 24 Years old, and something occurr&#8217;d to his Mind, which made him resolve not to ride out that Day ; and accordingly he made some bitter Protestations at Home that he would not. But before Evening he alter&#8217;d his Mind, and having prevail&#8217;d upon Blastock to accompany him, they both set out and robbed him in the manner set forth on their Trials : Imagining they were pursued, they quitted their Horses, and came to Town on Foot, where they are at a Loss how to dispose of the watch, being apprehensive it might be an Occasion of discovering them.</p>
            <p>Blastock who was but a Novice in these Courses, told him he was suprized, he who had dealt so frequently that Way, should be at a Loss to dispose of a Watch. Toon told him, that Business always had been done by P-ce, but as he had cheated him of a Guinea, he</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173805260018"/>
            <p>was resolved never to trust him again; however he remembered there was a Friend of his in <placeName id="OA17380526-geo-96">

            <p>Accordingly they both went, and found the Man at Home : Toon went in with the Watch, while Blastock waited at the Door; but as the Man knew how he came by such Things, he never offer&#8217;d half the worth of what was brought to him, and this Occasion they could not upon the Price.</p>
            <p>Blastock was discouraged by these Difficulties, in turning Goods in to Money, but Toon encouraged him, and told him he had another Friend to try still. They went to him, and offered him the Watch ; he at once offered 2 Guineas, which were taken, and were immediately parted between them.</p>
            <p>The next day the Watch was advertised, and the Man who bought it went to Seabrook, and informed him he had bought the Watch of one Toon, and he could assist him in finding him out. By this means he was taken and carried to <placeName id="OA17380526-geo-97">

            <p>Sir, about three Quarters of a Year agoe, I yoused to go to Sentos House very much, and the Reson that I whent so often there was, that I had a great Value for the Woman that goes for his Wife, altho&#8217; she is none of his Wife at all, for he has a Wife in Ierland, so he yoused to be very intemate with me, and at that Time I had been onst at Hamborg, and my delings there is in Damask and Celmancos, and Camlets, and Camlettees, and the Persons that I dele with there, is one Romize a Ducthman, and one Hutchinson a Scotchman, and others too tedious to mention, and this Senit, nowing that I delt there, he tould me that he had an Accoyntance in that Contry, and he tould me that his Name was Dixon, and he said that there was Money dew to him there, and I asked him for wot was it, and he tould me that one Bourk and he had sent two os the Gards from our King&#8217;s Gards to the King of Prusbes Gards, and that Dixon owed him Money on</p>

            <p>that Account, and he tould me that one White had a Mind to settle in Prusha, and one Burk. I knew nothing them then, but Senot made mw acquainted with the Methos of doing this Business, and so I spoke to the Captain and tould him I would answer for there Pasage, and make him recompence for it. And the next Day came While and Burk to Senot&#8217;s House, and they began to talk about going to Prusba, and I tould them I had spoke to the Captain about them. And then a litle Time afterward Sonet whent upon a Party to Windsor, and I went to <placeName id="OA17380526-geo-103">

Soe some Time after he coms to me, now sais he to me, I am come to make all Quarills up with you, and will be good Friends, and he said O must doe one Favor for him, which I did, and so the Time drew nigh that he was to go in the same Ship that I went in, he asked me to give White and Bourk each of them a Note, and he said they would not go without they had it from my Hand, and for all Quarils being made up, I gave them the Notes, and that made me pu om the Notes that it was there one Order, and so Senot swore against me for Revenge about his Wife, and as for the Close, I did not see them till they were upon there Backs. All that I have said hear is the whole Truth of the trance actions os thease People; but I put my trust in God that he will not punish the inocent, and it was all there one Desier to go Abroad, and they were all three to go together if this Senots Wife would have with them, and she would not, and still made the Man have more Malis agaisnt me, but God will judge them all in Time.</p>

Pity my dismal State, allmity Lord, And to my troubled Soul Relief afford.Forgive my Crimes, allmity God, forgive; My body dys, but Oh! My Soul must live Beyond the Grave, in endles Pain or Joy; What kills the Body can&#8217;t the Soul destroie.Then help my weke Endeavours to repent, And turn to thee, ere all my Hours are spent, On these black fleeting Minutes, Lord, I know, Depends my everlasting Bliss or Woe. Help me to make my Peace with Thee before My Glass rans out, and I shall be no more. O help me calmly to resine my Breth, be thou my Comfort in the Hour of Deth. And when my Soul is from this Body fled, And frends shall say of me, alas! He&#8217;s dead. Then may my Spirit sweetly wing away, To the brite Regions of eternal Day. In humble Hope of this, vain World, adew, A long Farwell to anxious Cares and you. Farwell to all my Company and Frends, I go to try a State that never ends. O!think betimes the Hour of Death will come, And hurry you to your eternal Home.O!think what follows Deth;in Time beware, Abd for your final Jugemend all prepare. This wicked, short, vain Life prise not too high, I&#8217;ve found in but a Dream and Vanity. Lay up your Treasures then in Heav&#8217;n above, be there yout Bodies sink into the Dust, you&#8217;ll find the comfort of your well plas&#8217;d trust. Your Flash shall rest in Hope of lasting Joy, Therefore be Wife in Life and well secure, That happy State where Joys enerese as, they endure.</p>
            <p>Glory unto the sacred Three, The God whom we adore, As was and is and shall be done. When Time shall be no more.</p>
