His Father, he says, was a Man in good Circumstances, and settled the rest of his Children happily in the World: But this unhappy Man being of a stubborn, self-willed Temper, 'twas a difficult Task to correct the Malignity of his Disposition at Home, so his Father thought proper to place him out Abroad to a Butcher.</p>
            <p>Glascow did not relish a Life of Slavery, nor would he endure the least Fatigue without murmuring; so that his Master could have no great Good of him, and the Behaviour of the Servant occasioned several and frequent Complaints of the Master to the Father, who partly with Menaces, and partly with Rewards and Promises, prevailed on his Son to have more Regard to his Master's Service for a Time, and more careful of his Business.</p>
            <p>With much ado he served his Time out, and had a handsome Beginning afforded him from his Father, to set up for himself; but this he was vile enough to squander away in Conversation and Company of lewd Women, and associated with such as were famous for singular Acts of Infamy. To these he joined himself, when all was thus foolishly expended, and began to infest the Publick.</p>

He took from the Passengers all their Money, &amp;c. and made off with the Booty undiscovered. He robb'd the same Night a single Gentleman, whom he met with in the same Neighbourhood, whose Money he demanded; the Gentleman having a Sword on attempted to draw; but Glascow, alarmed at this Intent, gave him a Blow on the Head with a Hanger, which knocked him down, and gave the Villain an Opportunity to do as he pleased; so he rifled him, and went off theGround, leaving him to take Care of himself. This Robbery and Ill-treatment the Gentleman could not easily put up with, and it made some Noise in the Neighbourhood; so that Glascow found it necessary to betake himself for Shelter to the Country; where he could not forbear his old Tricks, but many Times made free with a Sheep, or a Lamb, and disposed of it in the neighbouring Villages. When he thought the Hurry was over, he came again to Town, and, he says, he returned to his Business, getting Employ in <placeName id="OA17510729-geo-25">

            <p>The first Thing he now attempted upon his second Adventure, was upon a Mercer's Shop, which he and three Accomplices had set their Eyes upon, which they broke in the Night, and carried off several Pieces of Silk.</p>
            <p>Next a Master-Taylor fell into his Way, whose going into the Country, a little Distance from Town, he and his Companions got Notice of. Their Intelligence was, that he was about to carry several Suits of valuable Cloaths to some Gentlemen of Fortune there; they knew the Way he was to go, and so lay in Ambush for him in a convenient bye Place; from whence as he passed along they started, and robb'd him of three Suits of Cloaths, which they carried off.

            <p>Parish he either knew not, or, if he did, would not mention. His Parents were not in a Condition to give him Education, or, if ever he had any, his dissolute Way of Life had quite worn out all Appearance of it; being very ignorant, and of Consequence obstinate. When he was grown up fit to be put to a Trade, he might have been handsomely provided for; but having a natural Propensity to Vice, and being of a sullen Cast of Mind, he rejected all kind Offers made him, so he staid at Home with his Mother in Idleness till she was quite tired of him, and could nor would afford him any farther Subsistance, as he was of Years to get his Living, if he had any Regard to Industry and Honesty, and the Advice of his Friends; but he was already incorrigible, and deaf to all Admonition, which seemed rather troublesome to him, than any Ways tending to his Advantage. An unhappy Way of thinking, which too many of our Youth now-a-days are too apt to stumble into.</p>
            <p>However, at last Holland took it into his Head to go <rs id="OA17510729-occupation-19" type="occupation">Apprentice to a Waterman</rs>

            <p>In his early Days he grew very loose and wicked, and soon got among Pickpockets and Thieves. The first Thing he attempted, was the picking a Gentleman's Pocket of a Handkerchief, which he did with Success, and at length became as errant a Thief as any of them all. He committed several Robberies in Company with many that have gone to Tyburn before him, by which he got a deal of Money, &amp;c. but light come light go, and whatever he got was soon gone, as the lewd Women of the Town were his chief Delight. Sometimes he was dress'd as gay as might be, and sometimes like a dirty Scoundrel as he was.</p>
            <p>And now there were so many Accusations laying over his Head, as made him begin to be afraid of the Vengeance of the Law; and reflecting how he might avoid the impending Danger, he found the most adviseable Way would be to betake himself to the <rs id="OA17510729-occupation-20" type="occupation">Sea</rs>

            His repeated Infestations upon the Publick soon rendered him famous; and he had great Luck to have reigned so long as he has done, since many of his Companions have been hang'd within this two Years, and he was as forward and daring as any of them all. For Instance;</p>

He was a Youth naturally of a good Disposition, and submitted to his Father to make Choice for him, as the better Judge. He was his darling Son, and being unwilling to venture him out of his Sight, he recommended his own Business to him; and accordingly he was bound Apprentice to his Father for seven Years.

His poor Father, all this while upon the Rack for his Son's Welfare, was indefatigable in procuring Bail for him, which he shortly effected, and restored him to Liberty; but at the next Sessions he was indicted, and obliged, by the Verdict given against him, to remain in the said Jail for six Months. This Affair cost his Father a great deal of Money; he grew daily more uneasy in his Mind, was quite dejected for his darling Son's Misfortune, and contracted a Disorder that shortly put an End to his Life.

            <p>He behaved for the most Part without any great Concern, and on the 23d of July, a Person came into the Press-Yard to see him and Masterson, who thought he had been robb'd by them. After some Time he put the Question to them, but they denied the Fact; upon which the Man was so forward as to tell them, he was sure, 'twas them that robb'd him, and he could swear to them. Lawler hearing that, did no better nor worse, but took up a Bottle, and gave him a Blow on the Head, which laid him flat on the Ground. This plainly shews the same wicked Spirit still remained with him, to do Mischief, as long as he had Opportunity so to do, and argues how necessary it was that such a Wretch should be taken away from civil Society.</p>

Why he would not swear positively, it is generally believed might thus be accounted for; viz He was burnt in the Hand, and the excessive Grief and Pain of it so hurried him, that he scarce knew what he was about; accordingly he and the others were discharged, and returned to their former Works.</p>

How this is to be accounted for I leave to the Reader.</p>

They had scarce been a Month out of Goal, when it pleased God to put a Stop to their mad Career, and to bring them once more to Account: For on May 26 they assaulted and robbed Mr. Couty, and being taken and committed to the <placeName id="OA17510729-geo-77">

            <p>One would think the many Escapes this Youth had, might have persuaded him to think of some other Way of Life; but hence 'tis plain, that when once these poor unhappy Wretches have entered among these Disturbers of the Peace, and Destroyers of the Property of the People, nothing can put an End to their Wickedness, but what puts an End to their Power of Action.</p>

            , in a third Cart, went to the Place of Execution from Newgate, thro' great Numbers of Spectators. When they were brought there, after they were all tied up, some Time was spent in Prayer, recommending their Souls to the Almighty's Favour and Protection, and they were turned off calling upon God to have Mercy on them, and receive their Souls. They all behaved as became their Circumstances.</p>
            <p>Their Bodies were all delivered to their Friends in a particular Manner, occasioned by the Mob's crowding in upon the cutting down of one of the Bodies, which the Under Sheriff, who attended, insisted upon being dispersed and removed from about the pendent Bodies, e'er another should be cut down. It was accordingly so done, and then the Friends of such a one was called, and when they appeared the Body was cut down and taken away; and so on till they were all cut down and taken away; which prevented a good deal of Hurry and Disturbance.</p>
