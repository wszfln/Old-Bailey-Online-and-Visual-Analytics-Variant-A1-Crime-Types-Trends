            <p>As to the Behaviour of these two unhappy Men, they have not indeed shewn any Levity of Behaviour since their Conviction, but a certain Sullenness, and Reluctance at their Fate seemed always to attend them. At Chapel their Attendance was not so regular as might be, being hindered, as they pretended, now and then, by some slight Indisposition.

And being so frequently in their Company, and seeing their Methods of going on, he was captivated with the Hopes of the Profits arising from such Practices; which being backed by Persuasions, he was induced to take on with that notorious and wicked Set of People.'Tis very probable, by all Accounts of him, from such as are acquainted with the Country, and have had frequent Opportunities not only of seeing these Gangs of notorious Men, but of hearing their monstrous and unjustifiable Practices, that this Man had advanced to a great Degree of unlawful Behaviour, and been extremely famous in this Way. The Hawkhurst Gang, the most vile hitherto of all, being a Terror to their Neighbours, and to all that came in their Road, he has been for some Time a principal Person concerned in. Yet, as has been too frequently the Case with such as have been so unhappy as to suffer before him for these Offences, no Arguments or Persuasions can prevail with him to own the Fact sworn positively against him by several Witnesses; but he obstinately denies having been guilty of Smuggling for some Years past. And all this he does affirm, notwithstanding he has been acquainted with several Facts of that Kind laid to his Charge, besides other Practices, which undoubtedly, if true, have merited the utmost Censure and Rigour of the Law.</p>
            <p>What Credit may be given to his Denial of these Facts, there is scarce any one but will easily determine. He owns to have been greatly concern'd in running uncustomed Goods to a considerable Value; and yet will suffer no one particular Fact to be fixed upon him, if he might have Things his own Way. But as he has given so much Room for the Laws to take hold of him, I am apt to believe, all Men that are unprejudiced in his Favour, will look upon this ignominious Suffering to be a just Punishment of his many and flagrant Offences.</p>
            <p>It has been laid to his Charge, that not only to such as he looked upon as his Enemies, but his very Friends, those with whom he had great and many Years Intimacy, he has shewn the most unchristian-like and devilish Behaviour. In his Cups, which too frequently are attended with ill Consequences, especially by Men of his unhappy Turn of Temper, firing of Pistols has been his wonted Practice; even in such Company, and at such Persons, as he was thought to have the greatest Regard for. And, if any degree of social Virtue had been at any Time cherished in his Breast, he must have shewn it among his select Companions, or he cannot be supposed to have any Title to it. Far be it from me to endeavour to set off any Person in his unhappy Circumstances in a worse, or even so bad a Light as his general Character would bear. But as 'tis on all Hands agreed, that this unhappy Wretch has been most infamous: Neither would I by any Means endeavour to put a Gloss upon a bad Matter, such as will not bear the Light.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174805110006"/>
            <p>He seemed to have some Remorse for his ill-spent Life, and acknowledg'd in the general, that he had been a very dissolute and wicked Man; though he strenuously insisted on it, that he hadnever spilt any Man's Blood; that whatever other Mischief he had done, either to private Persons, or to the Community, he was very sorry for it, and hoping to be forgiven by those he had injured, he was content, being in Charity with all Men, to meet his Fate. He willingly gave up his Life, he said, a just Debt to the Laws of his Country, and resigned his Soul into the Hands of him that gave it, praying that in his last Moments it might be fitted for Mercy, and finally be saved in the Day of the Lord, through the alone Merits of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>He was a Fellow of a bold, daring, enterprizing Spirit, feared nothing, would undertake any thing.'Twas but a few Years ago that he robb'd a poor Fellow who travelled the Countries, of a Parcel of Lace worth near 50 Pounds, the poor Man knew not what to do, dare not attempt any thing against him in a summary Way; he therefore found out a Friend of Arthur's, who went to him, and after interceding for some Time, he agreed to give the Man his Lace again for Ten Guineas, which the poor Fellow joyfully accepted. Sometime after this, Arthur's Friend, being drinking with him, brought up this Story, and told Arthur he ought to have been hanged for doing it; when he immediately drew his Knife, and made a Stroke at him, which cut him quite into the Jaw-bone; and swore, if ever he mentioned that Affair any more he would surely be his Death.</p>

            <p>There are numerous Instances might be given of the Barbarity of Smugglers, but I shall confine myself to one or two very remarkable, in which Gray was principally concerned, in Decem. 1744. The Commissioners of the Customs being informed that two noted Smugglers, Chiefs of a Gang who infested the Coast, were skulking at a House in <placeName id="OA17480511-geo-24">

The Officers found them according to the Information, seized them, and committed them to Goal. But the rest of the Gang, of which Gray was one, being informed of the Disaster of their Friends, convened in a Body the Monday following, and in open Day Light entered the Town with Hangers drawn, arm'd with Pistols and Blunderbusses; they fired several Shot to intimidate the Neighbourhood, and went to a House where the Officers were Drinking; dragg'd them out, tied three of them Neck and Heels (the fourth, named Quaff, making his Escape as they got out of the House) and carried them off in Triumph to <placeName id="OA17480511-geo-26">

However, upon a Council held among them, they let Mr. Jones go, after they had carried him about five Miles from <placeName id="OA17480511-geo-28">

They carried the unfortunate Mr. Bolton and James, to a Wood near <placeName id="OA17480511-geo-29">

                        targets="OA17480511n18-1 OA17480511-geo-29"/>Hawkhurst</placeName>, stripped them naked, tyed them to two different Trees near one another, andwhipped them in the most barbarous Manner, till the unhappy Men begg'd they would knock them on the Head to put them out of their Miseries; but these barbarous Wretches told them, it was time enough to think of Death when they had gone through all their Exercise that they had for them to suffer before they would permit them to go to the D - l. They then kindled a Fire between the two Trees, which almost scorch'd them to Death, and continued them in this Agony for some Hours, till the Wretches were wearied with torturing them; they then releas'd them from the Trees, and carried them quite speechless and almost dead, on Board one of their Ships, from whence they never return'd.</p>
            <p>Another remarkable Instance is the following. It seems they have a Method of training their Horses that by a Check of the Reins, or a Kick with the Heel, they will instantly fling out their Legs in a surprizing Manner; to the great Danger of any Person who should unfortunately be within their Reach, an Instance of this as related from a Smuggler's own Mouth, happen'd not long since: 'Twas after the Gang had deliver'd their Goods, and were returning on Horseback to their respective Habitations, that they came by a Field in which were a Company of Gipsie Women with their Children; they leaped their Horses over the Hedge, and, dismounting, attempted to be rude with the Women, who resisted them, and made terrible Outcries; the Alarm brought down the Gipsie Men who were at some Distance, and perceiving the Intent of the Smugglers, they came furiously on, Arming themselves all the Way with great Stones, the Smugglers observing their Number to be much Superior, desisted from their wicked Intent on the Women, and Mounting their Horses waited till the Men got near enough to them, then turned their trained Horses Tails, gave them the proper Check, and they began Kicking like so many Devils at every Creature they could reach, till they had maimed a great Number; they then releap'd the Hedge and rode off, leaving the poor Creatures in the utmost Agony and Misery.</p>
            <p>He often had rencounters with the Officers of the Customs, and the Soldiers who assisted them, in many of which they beat and wounded the Officers and Soldiers in a terrible Manner.

In Consequence of which his Majesty in Council made an Order, requiring him to surrender himself within 40 Days after the Publication of this Order, in the London Gazette, to the Lord Chief-Justice, or to one other of the Justices of the Court of King's Bench, or to one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace.</p>
            <p>And this Order being thus published in the two succeeding London Gazettes, and exposed likewise by the Sheriff of the County's Directions, in two Market-Towns near the Place where the Fact supposed in the Information was done; it presently came to Rowland's Ears; ill News being observed generally to fly apace. He says, it very much surprized him; insomuch that he could scarce determine, for some Time, what to do in the Case. But, asking the Advice of his Friends, he was persuaded by them (his own Opinion at that Time concurring with theirs) to surrender. However, he thought proper to apply to a Justice of Peace (not indeed immediately to surrender) but to know, if he should do so, what might be the Consequence of it. The Purport of what he was given to understand by this Application was, that there was no other Method to be taken, but immediately upon his Surrender to commit him to Goal. Considering the Matter then with his Friends, and not willing to subject himself to such a Favour, the next Piece of Advice he received, was to try what might be done by some Interest he could make. This he did not do till too late: But thinking himself innocent, as he protests he was free from any smuggling Practices which came within the Act, that made Smuggling, Aiding, and Assisting, or carrying Fire-Arms in Company with three or more, a capital Offence, he was in Hopes to make it appear, before he might be apprehended. For some Time, he says, he did not abscond, nor any ways hinder himself in his Butcher's Business, upon any Suspicion or Fear of being apprehended. He had, however, set aside all Thoughts of Surrendering, and determined to wait the Event: And he told me, and several others who had Converse with him since under Conviction, that were the Thing to do again he would not surrender, whatever the Consequence might be.</p>
            <p>And, for the better Security of his Person, he thought proper, however, after some Time of his being proscribed, to retreat from publick Appearance, and went to dwell at a bye Place about 16 Miles from <placeName id="OA17480511-geo-36">

Certain Issues therefore contained in a Suggestion of Facts, necessary and consequent upon the Information, were examined into, and proved to have been carried on regularly, and as the Law required. And the Jury had nothing more to do, but to find for the Crown, and Execution was to be awarded in Consequence thereof.</p>
            <p>In the Course of our Conversation, since Conviction, he would still insist upon it, that he was not guilty of what was laid to his Charge, as he did upon his Plea. Upon which I thought proper to endeavour to make him as sensible, as was in my Power to do, of the Regularity in the Proceedings of the Law against him; and that he had it once in his own Power to have prevented the ill Consequences which he does now, with so much Reason, lament. To this his Reply was (fetching a deep Sigh, and the Tears starting from his Eyes) Well! Since this is the Case, God's Will be done. I have forfeited my Life, I cannot now help it. I shall endeavour to part with it as patiently as I can; I resign myself to the Will of Providence, and the Laws of my Country. And though he could not help blaming Sealy, who laid the Information against him; yet he would frequently say, though he wrongfully accused me, I forgive him, and wish he may be found to receive the same at the Hands of God.</p>
            <p>To the frequent Exhortations to that Chistian Duty of Repentance, e'er Salvation could be expected thro' the Merits of Christ, he always declared himself well inclined, and heartily sorry for all Offences of his Life; but expressed his Fears too, left his Heart might be so hardened as not sufficiently to repent. This frequently run in his Mind; which I looked upon as a sure Sign that the Grace of God was not withdrawn from him; and thought proper to give him to understand, that the Fears he had upon that Account, and the Sense he entertained of the supposed Hardness of his Heart, seemed to be rather Cause of Comfort to him than of Despair; for that when the Sinner hath the least Apprehensions of the Wrath of God, revealed against the Ungodliness, and Unrighteousness of Men, when he thinketh he standeth, then is his greatest Danger of falling.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174805110010"/>
            <p>I observed to him, As God requires no more of Man, in order to his Salvation, than remains in his Power to do, if their Endeavours are not wanting toreconcile him, i.e. to make their Peace with him; they have all imaginable Security for the Performance of his Promises made to Repentance and Faith. And if they make good Use of that Time and Opportunity permitted them, by having a sorrowful Sense of Sin, because 'tis so hateful to God, by making humble Confession to him of it, by an unfeigned Abhorrence, and forsaking of it, by turning to the Lord God heartily and sincerely, and by patient Continuance in well doing and thinking, so long as the Powers of Soul and Body are in Union; these are the Fruits meet for Repentance. And what a glorious Harvest shall we reap from them if we faint not.</p>
            <p>That ever he took Occasion to be concerned in that Practice of Smuggling, he lamented to the last; and feared, as it had been the Cause of his untimely End, so it might be of ill Consequence to his Family; but was persuaded that no well-disposed and generous Mind would ever reflect on them, upon Account of his suffering so scandalous a Death; for that in common Life his Conduct, and Behaviour, had not been exceptionable to his Neighbours, but rather the Reverse, as I heard several testify of him.</p>
            <p>Tho' his Time, he said, was short for Repentance, and turning to God, and Diffidence attended his Endeavours for some Time; yet at length appeared some glimmering Light of God's Grace breaking in upon his Mind; and he expressed his Hopes, that as it had pleased God not to suffer him to put off his Repentance, till the Night come in which no Man can work, his Endeavours might be accepted, and his Faith in a crucified Saviour prevail for the Reward of his Labour, tho' it were but for the eleventh Hour.</p>
            <p>As the Outrages of Smugglers are every Day encreasing, and scarce a Month but brings one or more to Newgate, the Breast of every honest Subject and Friend to the Common Weal, must be touched with a just Abhorrence of their Crimes in the general; and it is not to be supposed, but every one wishes to see an End put to those Disturbances of the public Peace, which too frequently happen in different Parts of the Kingdom, by their daring Impudence.</p>
