            <p>They were exhorted to prepare for Death, from Rev. 14. 13. And I heard a Voice from Heaven, saying, write, Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their Labours, and their Works do follow them. I shew'd them what it is to die, and that in the Lord, Whether Men be in a prosperous or adverse State, they are all liable to the inevitable Stroke of Death, and this the Apostle calls the Dissolution of this House of our earthly Tabernacle, 2. Cor. 5. 1. But then, although our corruptible Bodies return into the Dust, from whence they came, yet our Souls, which are of a nobler Substance and spiritual Nature, and in that Respect Partakers of the Divinity, do not perish with the Body, but depart into permanent and eternal Regions: And this has been the Belief of all Mankind, that the Souls are Immortal, as appears from the Gods whom the Heathens worshipped, which we cannot suppose them to have done, had they not believed them to be still existing in a future State. But we have a more sure Word of Prophecy than this, since Life and Immortality is now brought to Light through the Gospel. This is so plainly reveal'd to us in Scripture, that he who runs may read. I told them, that without Holiness no Man can see the Lord, Heb. 12. 14. And therefore that we may die in the Lord, it is necessary to keep a good Conscience, void of Offence towards God and Man, which if we do, then at the Hour of Death, a joyful Serenity ariseth in our Minds, from the Reflection upon the Innocency of our past Life, in Conformity to Christ Jesus, who was Meek and Lowly, Gentle and easy to be intreated; who was in a transcendant Manner possess'd of all those Virtues and Perfections, which adorn his Disciples and Followers, and render them Happy in Life and Death in Time, and to all Eternity. I shew'd them, that the Blessedness of those who die in the Lord, consists in the Souls being immediately after Death, and the Bodies, by their Re-union to the Souls at the Day of Judgment, being made perfectly bless'd in the immediate Vision and Enjoyment of Almighty God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>I inform'd them, how they were dedicated to God in Baptism, and what solemn Vows they had then made, to addict themselves wholly to the Service of God, but they having broken those Engagements in divers Respects, that it was Incumbent upon them, before they left this World, to renew themselves by Repentance, and devoutly to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, where Christ communicates his Love to the faithful Soul, and where assured Pledges of everlasting Life are given to us.</p>
            <p>While these and many like Exhortations were given, all of them who attended behav'd very Gravely in Chapel, but did not show those outward Signs of Repentance, which ought to appear in Men, who were in their dangerous and deplorable Circumstances.</p>

By this time Drummond being intoxicated with Liquor (as he said) to the highest Degree, he had ever been in his Life, for which, without further consideration, and having neither Grace nor Fore-thought at that Time, he mounted the Horse behind his Brother, on design to take himself to his Feet, as Occasion offer'd, and attack the Foot</p>

He said, that his Brother was a very wicked Man, that he formerly had been a Chapman in some Northern Town, but either failing in his Business, or willing to barter Commodities at an easier rate, than the ordinary way of Exchange and Trade, he had applied himself to the Highway, for four if not Six or Seven Years past, and that he was the sole Instrument of his Ruin. He own'd the Justice of his Sentence according to Law, but said, that he had never been Thief or Robber, excepting the two Facts for which he died. He lamented much for the Disgrace he brought upon himself, his Wife, Children and Relations, and hop'd, that the World would not upbraid them with his Crimes and ignominious Death. All the Time he was under Sentence, he behav'd with much Gravity and appearrent Devotion, and was very attentive to Prayers and Exhortations, whether in Publick or Private. He hop'd to be sav'd by the Mercy of God, through the Merits of Jesus Christ, seem'd Penitent for all the Offences of his Life, particularly the Crimes of which he was convicted, and died in Peace with all the World.</p>

                        targets="OA17291222n23-1 OA17291222-geo-21"/>Newgate</placeName>, when Dyer and Dumbleton, then under Sentence of Death, (who were Executed on November the 21st, for a Street-Robbery) were detain'd in the same Place, and of whom it was told, that they rob'd Marsh of what Money he had. I ask'd Marsh if it was true as was Reported of them? He affirm'd, that they took all the Money he had, which he said, was very little. But Dyer and Dumbleton being ask'd the same Question, said, they took nothing from him, but gave him both Victuals and Drink; and likewise said, that Marsh being in Liquor that Night he first came to the Prison, he made a great Noise, and disturb'd them in their Devotion, and upon that account they Reprov'd him; this was what they declar'd just before their Execution. Marsh never came to Chapel but one or twice, and when I visited him in the Cell, he seem'd rather to be possess'd with a Spirit of Laziness and Sloth, than any bodily Indisposition, but he pretended a weakness and lameness in his Legs. He bless'd me, when I pray'd for him; but when I exhorted him, among other Duties to forgive his Enemies, he sometimes said, he forgave Mr. Newman his Prosecutor, but this, after much Intreaty and Persuasion; at other times, that he could not forgive him, and the Night before he Died, he said in a most spiteful Manner, I'll tear him to Pieces. After all the Arguments, and Motives which could be Advanc'd, he still deny'd his setting Fire to Mr. Newman's Sheep-House and Granges. The Character he bore was, That he was an Idle Thievish Fellow (for he us'd to pick up and steal every thing he could get his Fingers on.) He was grosly Ignorant in Religious Matters. I endeavour'd what I could to Instruct him in a private Way, but he was so dull of Capacity and Inattentive, appearing like a crazy mad Person, full of Malice and unwilling to receive any good Impressions, that whatever endeavours were us'd for that End, little Success could be Expected. He did not deny, but he might have spoke rash Words, but utterly deny'd his actually commiting the Fact.</p>
            <p>At the Place of EXECUTION,</p>
            <p>THEY were all very Devout in Time of Prayers, and praising God, and said they had nothing to add to their former Confessions; only Younger said, he had been a very dissolute young Man, but as to Thieving and Robbing, he had never done any such thing, excepting that (instead of three Robberies which he mention'd before) he had committed five Foot-pad Robberies, and that for his Share of the Booty, in all of them, he receiv'd but a Triffle. Marsh went to Death denying the Fact which was prov'd upon him, and for which he died. He forgave freely all those who had any way injur'd him, and his Prosecutors. <persName id="OA17291222n25-1">
