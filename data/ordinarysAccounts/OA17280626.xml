            <p>While under Sentence, they were instructed, how that having such a load of Sin and Guilt, both original and actual, lying heavy upon their Souls, it was necessary for them to be regenerated and born again, as our Saviour representeth the Matter, St. John 3. iii - Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a Man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. I taught them, that by Regeneration is imported, our becoming New-creatures, not in a literal Sense, as Nicodemus at first understood that Expression, till our blessed Lord further instructed him, but in a Moral, Heavenly and Spiritual Capacity. I told 'em, that whereas formerly they had been the Servants of Sin unto Unrighteousness, henceforth they must become the obedient Servants of Righteousness unto Holiness; approving themselves with Consciences void of Offence towards God and towards Man: As the Apostle St. Paul directs us. That they must be like unto Christ in all those heavenly and divine Qualities, which adorn the human Nature, preparing and disposing it for Heaven, and Happiness, and the Glory of the Life to come; in Humility, Patience, Meekness and entire Resignation to the Will of God. I show'd them, that as all Sin is abominable in the sight of God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity in any of his Creatures; therefore it was their Duty to mourn before God, and Repent as of a Sin in general, so especially of those heinous Sins whereof they were convicted. Then I took occasion, to explain to them the great evil of Theft and Robbery, how near an approach it had to Murder, how destructive it was to all human Society and good Order, and how prejudicial to the Interest and Welfare of our Neighbours; and consequently, it must of Necessity prove highly displeasing to an holy, just and Sin-revenging God, who will by no Means clear the guilty. Exod. 34. vii. I instructed them also, that it was Necessary to confess their Sins ingenuously before God and the World, as tending to the glory of God, the Ease and Peace of their own Minds, and the Satisfaction of Mankind whom they had injur'd. I insisted on the nature of the Christian Sacraments, and what great Advantage their Souls might obtain, by partaking of the Lord's Supper, as proper to dispose them for the Joys of a future Life.</p>

None of them were Price Two Pence.</p>

Ward afraid of Imprisonment, and persuaded by some others who promis'd to Advance him what Money he might stand in need of, withal exaggerating the Danger he was in, comply'd with the Proposal, and married the young Woman; who (as he said) prov'd a most undutiful Wife, carrying away all he had, whether Money or Cloaths, and dispos'd of all his Effects to support herself in Drinking and keeping Company with other dissolute and lewd young Men, who kept her Company. Upon this Account he parted from his Wife, and after a considerable time married another, with whom he liv'd, and when he wanted other Business, apply'd himself with a Number of young idle Fellows, to the stealing of Lead from Gentlemen's Houses; but as to Street or Highway Robberies he denied that ever he committed any such, all he did being only to pick up any small loose Thing which fell in his way, he never having the Courage or Dexterity to pick Pockets. He said also, that he never was guilty of Burglary or House-breaking, excepting in that particular Instance, of which he was convicted: And this also he endeavour'd to extenuate, alledging that he only lifted up the Shutter and took away the Things, and that one Side of the Cistern was without the Dwelling-House.</p>

He said indeed, that he suspected, that one R -, with two other Rogues hand a Hand in that Affair: As to his being in the Street that Night, it was accidental, he and another Fellow being out upon their grand Design of stealing Lead from Houses, and that when the Fire began, they were above a Hundred Yards from the House. He was a very mean ignorant Fellow, I instructed him in the first Principles of Christianity, both in Publick and Private, but he was so dull and slow in Understanding, and had been so long inured to wicked Courses, that he attained to very little Knowledge. He owned himself to have been one of the greatest of Sinners, wholly immersed in brutish Sensuality, altogether negligent of his Duty to God, knowing and studying nothing of religious Matters. He was always apparently serious and very attentive in Chapel, professing his Faith in Christ his only Saviour, a sincere Repentance for all his Sins, and acknowledging the Justice of his Sentence, and that God in Justice had afflicted him for his many great Sins, and that he died in Peace with all the World.</p>

He denyed that ever he had been guilty of Theft, except in the particular Instance of which he was convicted; or that he had been notoriously Vicious in his Life, either in Drinking, Whoring, Swearing or Lying, as is common to most of them who are Guilty of those Crimes, but that he had always endeavour'd to live Soberly, and that he went to Church, when out of Service, or when his Business would allow him. As to the Crime for which he suffer'd, he own'd that he had all the Plate, Money and Goods of value, as they Swore against him, and that he believ'd, the Gentleman did not lose any Thing, for if any small Thing had been taken out, that it was made up by a little Money of his own, which he laid in with what he</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA172806260004"/>
            <p>had stolen. He deny'd, that he had concerted with any Person to rob his Master, but that two young Men of Vagrant idle Life, (who, as he believ'd, liv'd by frequenting Gaming-Houses, or otherways upon unlawful Purchase) frequently Advis'd him to rob Mr. Wright, not doubting but he might carry off a considerable Booty, which he might carry to Holland, or some foreign Place, and there dispose off it. Although they frequently importun'd him to this horrid Wickedness, and upbraided him with Pusilanimity, in not daring to execute such a villainous Attempt; yet he did not consent to the Proposal, although he did not altogether dislike it, making but a faint Resistance. At last, they Swore that they would commit the Robbery, if he would not. And the Night he left Mr. Wrights's Service, from some former Discourse of theirs, suspecting they would put their Design in execution, he did not go to his Lodging, but having drunk liberally, he walkt the Streets, and when he thought they might be setting about their Enterprize, he went to Mr. Wright's House, and that after he had gone three times about the House, without discovering any thing of them, at last one of the Fellows came up to him on the Middle of the Street, and deliver'd to him the Bundle with all the Goods, desiring him to wait, till he went and brought up his Companion and Assistant in the Robbery.</p>
            <p>Jenkins thought fit to make the best of his way, to shun his Associates whom he saw no more, and to keep all to himself; although this unlawful Purchase continued a very short time in his Possession, he having been apprehended the next Day, and the Goods recovered to the right Owner. He declar'd, that he knew no more of it, only he owned, that having been out of Service for some considerable Time, and most part of what he had, having been laid out for some of his Friends, he stood much in need of Money, which may make it suspected, that if he did not break open the House and steal the Goods himself, at least that he knew of the Design, and was upon some Concert with the Rogues. He behav'd with abundance of Civility, and appeared very Devout in Chapel, professing great Penitence, and declaring an earnest Desire to take the Sacrament. I advised him to forget his old Parents, Friends and Relations, for whom he shew'd a great Concern, because of the Reproach which his shameful Death would cast upon them; to fix his Thoughts wholly upon God and Eternity. He declar'd that he altogether contemned this World, believing to be saved by the Mercy of God in Christ, repenting of all his Sins sincerely, dying in Peace with all Men and in Communion with this Church.</p>
            <p>The Day before they were executed, two or three Gentlemen of Honour came to Mr. Jenkins, and told him, if he would freely discover his Accomplices, his Life should certainly be saved, but he would not alter from his former Declarations, which appearing altogether improbable, they left him to think upon it, and the Morning before his Execution, he persisted inflexible, refusing to make any further Discoveries to me.</p>

She denied that she was a Thief or Robber, saying that she had not Strength nor Courage, for such desperate Enterprizes on the Street or Highway; but own'd that she knew of every thing which her Husband and his Associates did, and received all from him. As to the particular Fact which she suffer'd, she said that M. S. - swore falsly against her, out of Malice, because she sought some Money which she ow'd for stollen Goods of her late Husband, which had been sold to her, and because she threatn'd to bring D - or N - the Evidence upon her, if she did not do her Justice, adding that she too much encourag'd Thieves by receiving of and disposing of their stollen Goods. She being very ignorant of Religion, I instructed her in the shortest and easiest way could be thought upon: She attain'd to some Knowledge, as the shortness of Time, and the vicious Habits of her preceeding Course of Life could allow. She appeared to be a young Woman of good natural Parts, if they had not been sullied with vicious Habits and Propensions. Some suspected that she had committed some Undecencies while under Sentence, but she said God forbid that I should deliberately damn my Soul, while I knew that I was a dying Woman. She always behaved civilly, and with attention in Chapel. She declar'd her Faith in Christ her only Saviour, a true Repentance for all her Sins, and acknowledging that she suffer'd justly for her sinful and scandalous Life; she died in Peace with all the World, and an unworthy Member of this Church.</p>
