Though reallove had provoked him to seek her favour, yet, that not being enough to support them together in life, he thought proper to look out somewhere else.</p>
            <p>Having been in business some time, he sent to his wife in the country a letter, desiring her to come up to <placeName id="OA17560223-geo-7">

            <p>He owned they did not live in great harmony together, but said 'twas her fault, as jealousy too often made her passionate, and her passion made him ill-natured. He said, that the day this dreadful affair happened, he indeed sat on his shop-board at work, and heard the words pass between his wife and the woman. He afterwards saw them, he said, come to close quarters, and engage, but utterly deny'd they were down on the floor. He said, when he saw Barnes pull out his wife's breast, he then got down from the board to part them, lest mischief might ensue; but, thought no harm might come from their pulling of caps, and what passed before. He was sensible of his want of proper regard to his wife, to suffer so much as she did, and owned his indiscretion in general, for that, had he interposed, as he ought to have done, he believed the whole fatal mischief had, in all probability, been prevented. He also was perswaded that his wife's death was hastened by the ill treatment of

            <p>But being also possessed of an opinion, as the woman was, that the punishment at most would be but branding in the hand, he was the more surprised to find himself capitally convicted. He afterwards wept and lamented for what he had done, or omitted to do, which brought him into a share in the murder, was grieved for the fate of his wife, and acknowledged <persName id="OA17560223n26-1">

            They both acknowledged how justly they suffered upon the whole, and he died resigned to his fate. It greatly afflicted them having so short time to reflect on what they had done; but, while they lived after conviction, they seemed fervent in prayer, for forgiveness from God's mercies in Christ.</p>

             her husband, and this woman, were all three related to each other, and had some years acquaintance; and the unlucky cause of strife between these two women, was Jefferies's wife having declared, that Barnes had another husband in the country, besides him in town.</p>
            <p>The two women had had jarrings and scoldings upon that account several times before that unfortunate one, when the grand mischief befell, but never engaged before but with the tongue, which, on both sides, Barnes owned had been pretty smartly; but, on the 15th of October last, Barnes came to <placeName id="OA17560223-geo-12">

Barnes's resentment for Mrs. Jefferies's declaration of her having two husbands was very great, nor could she long stifle it; so that words begat words, which proceeded at length to blows, and poor Mrs. Jefferies got her death by means of Barnes's ill usage.</p>
            <p>The fact was too plainly proved against her, and her abettor Jefferies (who ought to have had more regard to the wife of his bosom, than to suffer any one to mal-treat her) not to be attended with deserved punishment.</p>
            <p>The woman, when she found herself convicted capitally, was so shocked, that it almost deprived her of sense.

            <p>As he was a person of gay life, he used to frequent public places, assemblies, and dancings, at one of which he became acquainted with the lady he first married in <placeName id="OA17560223-geo-23">

He paid his respects to her, and after some convenient time past away in courtship, he gained her favour and consent.

And at length came the time that married they were, though the father's consent was not obtained.</p>

And, it seems, besides being himself a good hand at drawing patterns, he had brought over with him several curious and valuable things in that way, which seemed to bespeak no fear of not doing well, provided he might but have custom and employment.</p>

            <p>
            Neither, does he say, that this thing requisite towards well doing was wanting; he had business enough, and his work approved of, and growing in custom continually; but there was something yet wanting, which none but himself could supply, and that was content in his state of life, and an industrious inclination to stick close to business, the only way to get a large fortune, or to improve a small one; but, as his mind had been always given to change, so now he could not steadily apply to business; but pleasure, and the common diversions of the town, engaged too much of his time. Besides all this, he had another great evil, which his mind was possessed of, he soon grew tired of his wife, and, as harmony grew out of taste with him at home, a dislike to it also increased.</p>
            <p>'Twas observed before, that at the time Thompson married his wife, her father's consent went not along with the marriage; but, thro' the interposition of a friend, and well-wisher to either party, the father was willing to be reconciled, and made overtures with intent to have done him all the service in his power for the time to come. Thompson was made acquainted with this, who received the message with coolness and indifference. He promised indeed to accept the reconciliation, and to let what had been done pass in oblivion; but, on the contrary, he soon after took methods to destroy the good intentions of his wife's father, and put a bar to all future expectation of proffered friendships from him; besides mal-treating his wife, he practised several forms of insolent behaviour towards her father; so that he thought proper to keep himself at a distance from Thompson.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175602230009"/>
            <p>Thompson and his wife lived together not always in such manner as could be agreeable to her, but business went on, and Thompson might have done well had he but been possessed of patience, and a good inclination. And now, with respect to a material affair, which hath respect to this person's life and conversation, viz. the fire by which his house was consumed, and two persons perished in the flames, it may not be improper at this time to introduce it. An unfortunate affair indeed it was, and brought great odium on this poor man's character, how justly God knows; but we shall endeavour to put that affair in such light, as it hath upon former enquiry appeared, as wellas later, and as he gave the account of it himself.</p>

He had been in his business all day, and in the evening went with intent to fetch her home; but, calling at a relation's in the Old Change, and staying late in the month of February last, they both lay there all night, and, he declares, he never heard of the fire till next morning a person came to him on purpose to tell him what had befallen his house.</p>
            <p>He says, he went to <placeName id="OA17560223-geo-29">

He says, he had at that time lodgers in his house, who were at home that night, and escaped unhurt. The fire is said to have broke out about four o'clock in the morning, of the 20th of February, 1755, in which perished the lodger's maid-servant, and his own, who lay in the garret. His chief servant in his business also narrowly escaped, who running to the fore-door, found, that fast, and fled out at the backdoor, which she found open, and is now alive to attest the same. He does not pretend to say where the blame was to be laid that the house was fired, but says, a footman in the neighbourhood was employed to propagate the report that he was seen about his house in <placeName id="OA17560223-geo-30">

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175602230010"/>
            <p>After the fire was over, he went to the Insurance Office, which took some time, a month at least, to enquire into the nature of the case; but the enquiry found no cause of refusing to pay the insurance. His wife's father, and a friend of their's, went with Thompson to receive the; insurance, andsaw it paid without any scruple: after which they went to the tavern, and Thompson paid the above-mentioned friend a sum of money, which he was indebted to him. And upon their recommending the thing, he told them his intent was immediately to go to his creditors, and satisfy all their demands; but the contrary was the truth, and he disappear'd in a short time after, without having first seen any of his creditors.</p>
            <p>Thompson, at this time, and his wife, were in lodgings, in <placeName id="OA17560223-geo-32">

            <p>There was a circumstance, which seemed to clear him of such a wicked act as setting fire to his house, of which great suspicion has been entertained, we had like to have forgot,: and which comes from very good hands; viz. When he came to receive the insurance money, he proved he had goods destroyed in his house to the value of 900 l. and sure if this fact be admitted, 'tis unreasonable to think a man could be so wicked, as to burn 900 l. to get the insurance of 500 l. besides not knowing what other irreparable damage might be done. This is the clearest state of this case we can come at.</p>

            <p>The first thing he betook himself to, was how to send satisfaction to Scotland; which he contrived in this wicked manner, viz.

            <p>Being brought upon his trial, he pleaded not guilty to the indictment above recited: but such evidence was produced against his plea, as satisfied the court, as to his offence against the act of bankruptcy, though ail possible care wastaken to prevent any unlawful measures from taking place against him, and the jury brought in their verdict after a short deliberation, which pronounced him guilty.</p>
            <p>He seemed, after conviction, in his natural temper, a man of strong passion, very prone to, and strong in, resentment of supposed injury. As witness a letter he sent to his English wife's father; in which he gave under his own hand, which he did own, the greatest marks of a most unchristian cast of mind, wishing all evil, temporal and eternal, to him and his family, if he did not interpose to prevent his suffering. This being followed by a most audacious, anonymous, threatening letter to the same person, published afterwards in the Gazette, 'twas reasonable to imagine the latter also came, if not immediately from him, yet not without his privity and consent; though to the last he denied any knowledge of, or concern as to its purport. He owned the former, but utterly persisted in ignorance of the latter.</p>
            <p>When we first had any converse together, he was very rough in his expression, and declared, that tho' he was bred a protestant, yet having been so ill used, as he pleased to call it, by persons of that church, he should choose to die a <rs id="OA17560223-occupation-28" type="occupation">Roman catholick</rs>

But before I saw him again, a letter came, desiring to be excused for what he had said in a hurry and confusion of mind; and afterwards he attended chapel regularly, unless slightly indisposed. He read, and took pains to write out prayers, and other devotional meditations, towards the latter part of his time, and seemed greatly affected at his approaching end; and above all, acknowledged and lamented his not using his English wife so well, as her merit in every respect deserved at his hands.</p>
            <p>As to his suffering upon the act of bankruptcy, for an offence committed against it, he in general did acknowledge to be just; but he would never be persuaded to own, that he had any personal notice of it, till he was brought before Mr. Fielding; and says that gentleman first founded it in his ears, which was his own expression. In fact, he says, he never read it in the publick papers, not being much given to read; nor did any friend in London, while he was in Scotland, advise him of it.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175602230013"/>
            <p>In this situation of mind, he met his fate, to all appearance, calmly and resigned; and having struggled hard with this world, he hoped to be at rest in that which is tocome, through the mercy of God, in the Redeemer of the world.</p>

            <p>After he had been with his uncle some short time, (he cannot be particular) he ran away from him, and went into the country to his mother. His uncle fetched him back, as soon as he found where he was got, and brought him home.

He would sometimes work, and sometimes play, or do worse; for he owns, he had not resolution enough to avoid going into company, which he was sensible, in the end, would prove his ruin.</p>
            <p>He says he had a wife and two children living; his wife, he acknowledges, was a good woman to him, and deserved better usage than she met with from him; nor knew she any thing of his wicked way of life: for he kept company with another woman, in <placeName id="OA17560223-geo-52">

He always rode out armed with a pistol, and tho' he had made several attempts, declares he never succeeded, but in the twoforementioned robberies. He had a very good character given him, by several, upon his trial; but the fact was too plainly apparent for any character to take place.</p>
            <p>After conviction, he behaved very quietly, and seemed sensible of his unhappy situation; and tho' his friends had been as earnest as might be to save his life, yet he placed no dependance upon it, but expected the fate he met with.</p>
            <p>He knew his behaviour had been such as rendered him liable to the severity of the law, and always, when at prayers, behaved as a person would be expected to do, who had no other hopes but to propitiate the God of heaven and earth, that he might depart the world in assurance of bliss and comfort hereafter.</p>
            <p>As to the firing off the pistol at the time he was taken, he says that he really knew not how it came about; owns the having a pistol, but says he was so drunk as not to be sensible of doing it. However, it so frighted the horse, that, it is supposed, he ran against the wall, whereby Wade got a large wound on the left-side of his head, fell down, and was taken, and suffered for all his evil deeds.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding all this, he set up a defence that he could bring witnesses of his being in company, at the time that the robbery was committed, at his lodgings.</p>

            <p>But, the court observing that Broadhurst was apprehended before the time she swore she saw him at supper, it appeared she must have sworn falsly; so, after the evidence was sum'd up, the jury, agreeable thereto, deservedly brought him in guilty, and the woman was committed to Newgate, when she declared Broadburst to be her husband. This was at December sessions, from which time she was continued in Newgate till January sessions, and then, at the goal-delivery, discharged for want of prosecution, and all this notwithstanding he pretended innocence, and died a <rs id="OA17560223-occupation-32" type="occupation">Roman Catholick</rs>

            <p>He says, he was concerned in the shop with the remaining part of the family at the time that he fell into this unfortunate affair, and had no occasion, for want of any thing, to commit a robbery. How true this may be, we know not; but, sure it is, that he was so wickedly disposed as to lead a very dissolute life, and most of his time was spent in scenes of lewdness and debauchery.</p>
            <p>He seemed to be a youth of a rough disposition by nature, and, though somewhat sullen, behaved quietly and decently after conviction. But, though he did acknowledge the barbarous treatment of the Dutchman, by cuting him in several places, and dangerously wounding him, yet was he by no means to be persuaded to own any manner of concern in robbing the Dutchman, or any other person whatsoever; and, however the prosecutor Leonard was robbed, he persisted to the last in denying he robbed him, or knew who did.</p>

            <p>After some time spent in prayer, recommending their souls to the Almighty's Acceptance, nothing worth notice was said by either of them, excepting Broadhurst, who said, he died innocent, upon what principle I will not pretend to say; but, however, he did not deny the fact itself publickly, whatever he did privately.</p>
