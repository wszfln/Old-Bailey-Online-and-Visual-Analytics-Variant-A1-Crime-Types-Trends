In all attempts of this kind he was disappointed, and not having money to support his grandeur, he began to defraud many of his acquaintance, till they found him to be a cheat, and would not suffer themselves to be imposed on any longer; he then began to pilfer, steal and to forge. He many times attempted to get off forged notes, and, at last, had success in receiving the wages of an old shipmate, personating his brother, forging a will and giving a receipt in his name for 7 l. 9s.</p>
            <p>While under sentence of death, he behaved in a very decent manner, having great hopes of a reprieve on account of his friends; he wrote several petitions to them, especially to some of the members of parliament for North Briton; but, instead of signing his name Miln, he signed it Cook, which so disgusted his friends, that they declared they would not trouble themselves about him. After the report was made, he seemed resigned to suffer, and said his sentence was just, and hoped it would be a warning to other young men. Tears flowed from his eyes in abundance; he expressed a comfortable hope, that God for Christ's sake would have mercy on his precious soul. In this situation of mind, he continued till he gave up his spirit into the hand of God.</p>

He was several voyages in the English East India service. At the beginning of the last war, he entered on board of a man of war, and continued in the service till the peace: he went through many hardships and difficulties in that time. After the peace was proclaimed, he came to England, and received a large sum of money for prizes and wages, which he spent in a little time, which put him upon projecting how to get more without going to sea again. He resolved not to take to any petty way of thieving, but determined, if possible, by any stratagem, to make his fortune at once, and to go into his country. Having been often in the East India-house, and seen the bullion hoisted (as he called it) out of the bullion-office into the carts, to be sent aboard the ships, he began to scheme, if by any means he could get into that office, and take away a quantity of the money without being discovered. A week before he was executed, he made the following confession to me of his</p>

            <p>whole proceedings, from the beginning to the completion of the robbery. The week before Ladyday, he went several times to the India-house to contrive how to get into the bullion-office; at last he found a chimney in the sailors lobby, which he perceived went up to the floor of the bullion-office (as he thought;) he therefore determined to conceal himself in the chimney, and take proper tools to break through the floor, (if he could possibly get up the chimney) which he thought would be very easy, as their was no ceiling to the floor: accordingly he went to <placeName id="OA17650417-geo-34">

In about an hour after he attempted to get up the chimney; he got up a considerable way, but found it too narrow for him: he therefore broke his way through, and got to the floor, and with the gimblet bored several holes in the floor, and then, with the marling spike, broke the holes one into another, and got the pieces of wood out, so that in a little time he got the hole large enough to get through: when he had done this, he found a greater difficulty to surmount; for, instead of the bullion office, he found it to be the tea warehouse, and a chest of tea over his head; the chest being made of very thin wood, he soon made his way through it; but, when he had done that, he was near having a stop put to his whole proceedings; for the tea came with such a force upon him, that it was as much as he could do to save himself from being suffocated; it was with much difficulty he extricated himself out of it, by letting the tea down the chimney into the lobby: when he had done this, he got from off the chimney into the empty chest; he then found another chest of tea over that, but</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176504170013"/>
            <p>having been almost suffocated with the first, he made the hole in the bottom of that not so large, but let all the tea gradually into the lobby: when that was done, he found a third chest, which he let down the chimney as before: when he had got through all the chests of tea, he got down into the sailors lobby, and the boards being loose, he scraped all the tea into the rack cellar, which is under the lobby, the better to avoid being discovered, if any one should come into the office: when he had done this, he went up into the tea-warehouse with his crow, gimblet, and marling spike; he first attempted to bore through the wooden part, but finding it impracticable, he, with the iron crow, broke in pieces two chests of tea and threw it about warehouse; and then broke thorough the brick work into the clerk of the bullion office's closet: when he had done this, he took away three bags of dollars, and let them down out of the tea warehouse into the lobby, by the assistance of a rope he found in the warehouse; then he came down into the lobby, and contrived how he might get off undiscovered. He declared he was so weak with fasting, that the three bags was more than he could possibly carry away; he was therefore obliged to leave one of the bags behind the door; the other two he slung across his shoulders, under his sailors coat, and then concealed himself till the office was open; and he then got off undiscovered. He had some thoughts of going back to take the other bag of dollars, but was afraid of being discovered; he carried the two bags to the girl that he kept, and told her, that now he would make her a gentlewoman; for he had got money enough, and he would take her to France in a few days. They set off in the Dover machine, but God, who never suffers iniquity to go unpunished, brought him to justice when he thought himself safe.</p>

            <p>While under sentence of death, he behaved in a very decent manner; but being a Roman Catholic, he would not attend chapel, but a priest was permitted to visit him; I conversed with him several times; he seemed to be very teachable, and deeply sensible of the necessity of true repentance, and he frequently refused to let me pray with him.</p>
            <p>On the morning of Execution.</p>
            <p>AFTER the priest had left him, I conversed with him of the certainty of a future judgment, and the impossibility of having our sins pardoned, but by the Great God of the whole earth.</p>

            <p>He seemed convinced that the absolution of a priest would avail him nothing; except God pardoned his sins, he must perish eternally. He then desired me to pray with him, which I did, and he was very much affected, and earnestly prayed that God would have mercy on his soul.</p>
            <p>At the place of execution, I prayed with him again; he fervently called to God for mercy, in these words; O Lord! for Christ's sake, have mercy upon a poor sinner, bestow de charity on de poor sinner. The spectators was much affected with the earnestness of his prayers; he desired them to pray for him, and I believe many of them did. After I left him, he was turned off, crying, Lord Jesus receive my soul.</p>
