He much lamented his Case that he had not rather died in the Bed of Honour, having survived all those Dangers, to come to such an ignominious Fate.</p>
            <p>He was very weak after Conviction, and desired to die rather than live, but said the Prosecutrix had sworn very hard against him, as well as the other Evidences, for that he neither did, nor intended a Robbery. The Case as he set forth, and he always said the same to me to the last, was as follows, viz. That he had been that Day abroad with the Prosecutrix and some others, Men and Women, that they had drank pretty freely, and that he had gone so far towards treating the Women, as to pawn his Shirt, which he wanted the next Day to go upon Guard with. When he considered this, he would fain have redeemed his Shirt, but as none of the Company had any Money, he made free and took her Cloak, and said he would pledge that to get his Shirt, and leave it in Pawn till he could redeem it.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175005160009"/>
            <p>However, he went to his Quarters that Night, with the Cloak in his Possession, and thought no more about it, till the Evidences had cooked up the Affair, and made a Robbery of it. He said also, that what he confessed to the Justice, was only the taking the Cloak, but he had no Thoughts of doing it in the Way of Robbery, but that the Woman should have her Cloak, and no Harm he thought had been done. As it had pleased God to suffer him to fall under this Calamity, he was very well content and resigned, andbegged of God to forgive him, as he did all the World. He knew not but it might be an Affliction from the Lord, for the Offences of his past Life, as he had been a wicked young Man; and said, he hop'd to make such Use of his Punishment now, as that his Soul might be happy hereafter.</p>

He says, he has not been in Wales since he first left that Country, nor in England above twice or three Times, for this ten Years past, and that but for a short Space at a Time. The greatest Offence he could charge himself with, and had to answer for, he said, was Drunkenness, to which he had been much addicted both at Sea and Ashore; but that he never wronged Man, Woman, or Child, to his Remembrance, of any Thing.</p>
            <p>As to the Ticket, for forging of which he was convicted, as he said at first, so he continued to declare to the last; that if it was a forged Ticket, it was none of his doing, but that it was the very same he had of the Captain's Clerk. He wanted to go from the Ship, but was refus'd, unless he could get another Man, which he said he contrived to do; and then being about to be discharged, he applied for a Ticket, which was given him by the Captain's Clerk, who asked him to sell it, and told him he must loose 3 s. and 6 d. in the Pound for prompt Payment. Perry said, he refused to sell it, and purposed to take a Voyage to the Banks of Newfoundland, thinking that by the Time he returned, the Ticket might be payable, and then he should receive the Whole, and he pretended to choose to stay till his Return; upon which, says he, the Captain's Clerk bid me take it, and go about my Business, and be d - n'd. The Account he gave of himself was, that he could neither write, nor read Writing, and knew not but that it was a good Ticket, till he heard it was refused at the Office. When I told him, that the Captain's Clerk swore in his Evidence, that he neither gave him, nor any one else that Ticket, he was accused for, he said, he had no other from him, nor could he be imposed upon by any one else, for it was never out of his Hand, till he sent it to <persName id="OA17500516n43-1">

He was a Man of a most surly and morose Temper, and of a malicious Heart and Intention; and by his whole</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175005160010"/>
            <p>Behaviour in Life, before this wicked Act was done by him, (as his Neighbours can testify) and all along to his Death, as appeared to every one that saw him under Confinement. He valued not what Mischief he did to revenge himself on any one that should do any Thing he did not like with respect to him, tho' never so lawful.</p>
            <p>And the Cause of this barbarous Treatment of his Neighbour appears to be a Resentment he had taken up at him, for that he being a Man of more Conscience, and greater Regard to the Laws, than Archer was, had laid an Information against him, which was followed by an Indictment for vending his Goods on the Sabbath, as was his constant Practice, to the Nusance of the whole Neighbourhood. Upon this Account Archer vow'd Revenge, and was heard by several the Day the Fact was done to say, that he would be revenged on Higgins before Night. Accordingly what does he do, but watched an Opportunity, and from his one Pair of Stairs Window maliciously levelled a Gun at him, as he was sitting in his own Shop minding his Business, and little suspecting the Mischief intended him; as the poor Man sat with his Back towards him, he fired his Gun and shot him in the Back of the Head, and in his Neck, and in a most dangerous and desperate Manner, insomuch that a 100 Shot were taken out of those Parts. When he had done, he rejoiced at his Wickedness, bragg'd of being a good Marksman, and with bitter Curses said, he seldom miss'd his Mark, nor was he sorry for what he had done.</p>
            <p>He would never say any Thing as to the Fact himself, nor scarce tell his Name, but said, he was to lose his Life for what he had done, and what had any one to do with what he had done. His Behaviour at the Time of Conviction, and since to his Death, was very insolent and daring, and surprized every one that saw him. A Night or two before Execution, there was a great outcry of Murder in his Cell, occasioned by his drawing a Knife at one of his Fellow Sufferers, that lay with him, and swearing bitterly that he would kill him, only because he would not leave off Reading, and listen to his Nonsence, and wicked Conversation. And the Night immediately before his Execution, being left in the Cell by himself, it not being safe to leave any Body with him, his Bed was set on Fire, as was greatly believed, with Design, having been heard to say, he would not be hanged; but the Smoke discovered it, and Assistance coming, it was put out, and he was left without Candle. He continued obstinate to the End, and could scarce be prevailed on to do any Thing towards making an Atonement for the Sins of his past Life, tho' they were many and great, this not being the first Time he has seen the inside Walls of Newgate. A more obstinate, hardened Wretch I never saw, and every one that beheld him, was surprized to see that a Man could, by his brutish Behaviour, so near degrade himself to the Beast.</p>

In Regard to the Fact for which he suffered, it was so plainly proved, that he could not even make any Evasion relating thereto, it being suggested to him, that as it did not appear he had any regular Occupation to pursue, and that he must have followed that Trade a long Time. He again replied, as before, it was no Matter to any Body, he should not give any Account of it. So that, upon the Whole, it appears natural to conclude, that he must for many Years past have followed that, or some other wicked Business, for a Support, rather than by honest Industry gain a Livelihood. However, he seemed to behave penitent for one under his Circumstances, own'd the Justness of his Sentence, and said, he died in Peace with all Mankind.</p>

They next stopt a Gentleman and two Ladies, from the Gentleman and one of the Ladies they took some Silver, and from the other Lady a green Purse with 18 d. in it.

A little farther they stopt three more Men, one of whom cried very much, and beg'd for God's Sake to take away their Pistols; after searching him, they found no more than three Halfpence, which they flung at him again, and one of them in a Passion seiz'd hold of him, andswore bitterly, if he did not immediately cease his sniveling, he would sling him into a Ditch.</p>

Hamilton's Behaviour was intolerably indecent there, talking and laughing almost all the while the Executioner was tying them up, and using such Expressions as are better stifled than reported. May called aloud to a Fellow to take his Hat and Wig. Of the rest, not one of them said any Thing; but after Prayers, when the Caps were pulled down over their Faces, the Cart drew from under them, and most of them seem'd to have hard Conflicts with Death.</p>
            <p>Being cut down, their Bodies were chiefly taken care of by their Friends; but one or two having no Friends, were left under the Gallows, and are said to have been carried away for the Purpose and Use of Anatomy.</p>
