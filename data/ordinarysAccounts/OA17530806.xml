He pretends he went out to get a Waistcoat he had pawned to a Woman, and he went that Night, because he had been told she was to sell it the next Morning, and he had a Mind to have it again: But it proved the worst Night's Work he ever did. He owns that he was a little loose, was given to Drink, and frequented most of the Publick-Houses in the Neighbourhood; but says, he never was guilty of any Sort of Robbery before in his Life: And he always did represent this for which he was convicted, in the following Light; positively, to the last, denying his knocking the Prosecutor down, and putting him in Fear, as sworn against him. He says, on that unfortunate Night, he, and the Evidence and Accomplice, went from one Publick-House to another, and drank together, not one Word being mentioned of Intention to rob any Body. He had been but once before in his Company, which was about three Weeks before. The last House they were at that Night, he says, was in <placeName id="OA17530806-geo-15">

At last, he says, the Prosecutor was going away, about nine o'clock in the Morning, somewhat in Liquor, and refused to pay his Reckoning before he went: Upon which, some were for husselling him, and setting his Heels where his Head stood, that so, his Money falling out of his Pocket, the Landlord might pay himself; but the Evidence Cutty said, we have another Way for that; and so laying down before the Prosecutor, in the House where they were, with others then present, they pushed him over Cutty's Back, and the money did fall out of his Pocket. Fish says he never thought any Thing of the Matter, 'till he saw the 36 Shilling Piece on the Ground, and the Temptation was then so strong, that he took it up, and immediately went away; and adds, that he never saw the Prosecutor that Night, any where but in the House.

Thus Corbee went on 'till Fear gave him Wings, and away he sled for a while. By this Time he was become so notorious, that the Thieftakers had got Scent of him, and they came upon the Parade, where he was upon Duty, to take him. However, he had the Luck to escape their Hands for the present, and he deserted, and went down into his native Country.</p>
            <p>When he came there, he says, he was forced to invent a Lie to his Brother, who asked him upon what Account he was come down? He told him, that he had behaved faucily to, and had abused an Officer, for which he was forced to fly, and if he was taken, he should be tried by a Court-Martial, and ten to one but he should be shot. His Brother believed the Story, and, in order to skreen him, took him with him into the Coal-pits to work.</p>
            <p>The People in the Country, before he had been long there, knowing him to be in the Army, suspected him of Desertion; but he found Means, for some Time, to prevent their molesting him, and continued to work in the Coal-pits with his Brother.

His Conscience went along with him, and he wanted no other Plague or Tormentor.</p>

            <p>He says, the first Person that seduced him to go upon the Highway, was a Corporal in his Regiment, who is now an Officer Abroad in the East-Indies; and that he has done many Robberies with Corbee and Eyres. He was a strong hardy Fellow, and seemed capable of any Mischief. He owned he had been very wicked, and had committed divers Robberies, by himself, and with the others. One of which particularly was rivetted in his Mind, it being a very remarkable one, and a great Booty. His Conscience was troubled upon Account of it, more especially, because he heard the Man whom he, and the beforementioned Person gone Abroad, had robbed, was blamed for it, and lay under some Disgrace.</p>

            <p>For some Time after Conviction he behaved in a surly Manner, and seemed not to like his Situation; but when his Gall was once broke, and he found he was to suffer no more than he had a long Time deserved, I found by him, that this sullen Appearance, and downcast Eyes, proceeded from the Conviction he felt in his own Breast, of the Folly and Baseness of his past Life; having been, particularly for two Years past, a Scene of continued Injury and Wrong, whenever he had Opportunity to do it, not regarding how, where, or to whom he did it. Many are the Robberies he has been concerned in, with the Person gone Abroad, Corbee, and Eyres; and a dangerous Fellow he was, resolute, and ignorant, scarce susceptible of Fear. His Memory wasvery shallow, as to Particulars; but the Robbery, for which he died, he owned, and said his Suffering was richly deserved. After this Night's Work, he too thought proper to fly, and went down to his native Country. He says, he had no Peace of Mind, while absent, and he met with but little Encouragement to stay. Upon his Return to Town, he was not long before he was taken up. Eyres was admitted an Evidence, having been taken up for the Robbery of Mr. Clifton and his Brother, and he had impeached Ayliff, who being brought before a Justice, owned the Fact, and several others, and was committed.</p>
            <p>He had deserved the severest Stroke of the Law a long Time, he said; and wished to die long before the Day. He was ignorant, but willing to receive Instruction, and having a deep Sense of his own Unworthiness, he hoped Forgiveness at the Hand of God, for the Sake of Christ alone.</p>

            <p>He says, he cannot deny but that he was afraid he might one Day be taken, though he was not the Person, yet, as a Smuggler, it might fall upon himthrough Mistake; and at last his Fears proved to be not without Foundation. As he was sitting at Table in his House at Dinner, he found his Gate was beset; he says, his Mind suggested to him, that it was People come to take him, and so it proved. He escaped out of the Back door, but was closely pursu'd by two Soldiers, and two Officers, to a Brook near his House, which he attempted to leap over, thinking so to facilitate his Escape; but tho', he says, he had leaped it several Times before, his Feet now unluckily slipp'd, and he fell in. Upon which, one of the Soldiers fired a Pistol at him in the Water, which grazed upon the Top of his Head, and left its Mark for 6 or 8 Inches where it passed along. Notwithstanding this, he got out of the Water and ran, but was overtaken by one of the Soldiers again, with whom he had a Struggle. Cullingham says, he got him down, and beat the Pistol out of his Hand, tho' himself had not any Arms, not so much as a Stick. Then came up the other Soldier, and between them they beat him over the Head in a most violent Manner, which the Marks in his Head shewed when he was brought to Newgate. He struggled with them, and says, he had them both down, but being almost tired, and they continuing to lay on him severe Blows, at last, one of them took out another Pistol, and being close to him, shot him directly in the Thigh, left he might get the better of them, and escape, and then they took him. The Officers of the Customs, he says, stood at a Distance to see fair Play, but did not come near. They took him at a Disadvantage, but had he been prepared with any Sort of Weapon, it was Odds against his being taken. After his Wounds had been a little taken Care of, he was brought up to <placeName id="OA17530806-geo-54">

            <p>Cullingham was convicted upon the Outlawry, and has behaved since in a very serious and devout Manner. He has been greatly afflicted with Illness, in different Shapes and Degrees. His Wound in the Thigh was some Time before it was closed up, which occasioned a Lameness to his Death. Then an agueish Disorder frequently attacked him, attended sometimes with a Fever, which almost tore him to Pieces. After this he was seized with that loathsome Disease the Small-pox. All these he had Resolution and Strength to bear up under, and had well high got the better of it before he suffered. He appeared all along, and to the last, to be truly and sincerely sensible of having offended God, in that he suffered him to be so sorely afflicted in this World; and said, he hoped that he might receive the due Reward of his Deeds while in this Life, that so he might have the surer Hope and Assiance in God's Promises of Life eternal, thro' Christ Jesus; and he died thoroughly resigned to the Will of God.</p>

The Son (unhappily for him) began to take the Man upon him too soon, and by his Folly and Wickedness, has cut himself off, and quitted Life, before he well knew what Life was. And he does own, that had he paid regard to his Father's Instructions, and good Advice, which he ought to have done, and not let loose the Reins to his own Will, and headstrong Passions, the Case must have been quite otherwise, than what it was, he could never have been so unhappy. He says he first rejected his Father's Councils, and then forsook his God; and Destruction hung over his Head from that very Time.</p>
            <p>Within these two Years past, he has been a most wretched Prodigal, and undutiful Son. He would leave his Father's House sometimes for a Fortnight, or three Weeks, and sometimes longer, and wander up and down the Country. Sometimes he would consent to work with one Tallow-Chandler, and sometimes with another; all this while doing Wrong to his Father, and neglecting his Duty to him, both as a Son, and as a Servant: And, instead of assisting to get Money, as he was doubly engaged to do, he has found means to squander away for his Father, a large Sum of Money, in riotous Living, and what may be called by some Gaiety and Pleasure. He says, 'twas the Number of Places of Entertainment that led him to his Ruin; all which he attended as oft as they were open, one at one Time, and another at another. But they were all frequented by him at Times, and when once he had had a Taste of them, his Mind was never easy, nor could be pleased any other way. His Fortune could not support it, because he had none; but his Father's Substance suffered for it, and was scattered every Day, like Dust in the Wind.</p>
            <p>Some Time ago his Father sent him to <rs id="OA17530806-occupation-27" type="occupation">Sea</rs>

But this would not do; he returned about Christmas last, and soon gave Earnest, that the Change of Air had not changed his Mind. He was now grown too headstrong for his Father, and would go his own Way in Spite of his Persuasion or Authority.</p>
            <p>Bad Company, you'll imagine, he was got into. Too true it was; and they of both Sexes. His Father found what vast Inconveniency it must be to him, if the Youth went on as he had done, the rest of his Family must be ruined. So he began now to think it necessary to take Care to prevent his squandering away any more.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175308060013"/>
            <p>The unhappy Youth finding himself thus curbed, what does he do? Why, in a Rage, and mad at his disappointed Hopes, that his Father would not let him still go on, he goes to his Companions, and tells them his Case. They werenot long considering the Matter, before they persuaded him to the forlorn Hope, to go upon the High-way; one was to go with him, the other was to share in their Fortune, provided they succeeded.</p>
            <p>When he left his Father, 'twas with Design to go to Sea again, and a Sea Chest, and all Things were provided for him, and sent, as his Father thought, on Board a Ship, and that his Son was gone to Sea. But, how sadly did he find himself mistaken, when the News came of the Son's being in Custody for the High-way.</p>

            <p>When he was brought to Newgate he lamented greatly, and said, that Necessity had drove him to it; that he had been ashamed to go Home to his Father, having spent so much Money for him, and used him very ill. What he called the Pleasures of the Town, and Places of Entertainment, had been his Bane. He wanted Money to support his Extravagance in frequenting these Places, and the Advice of bad Company had put him upon going on the High-way.</p>
            <p>The Fact upon Trial was fully proved, and he had nothing to say in his Defence.</p>
            <p>After his Conviction he had great Hopes of saving his Life, and great Interest there was made for him. But this Behaviour in the Robbery seem'd to shew he was no Novice to these Things, and left very little Room for Mercy.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175308060014"/>
            <p>He said indeed, that he had been upon the High-way 8 or 9 Days before this Robbery was done. Then he, and the Person in the Counter, went out together, and were several Hours in <placeName id="OA17530806-geo-66">

            <p>When he found he was included in the Warrant, her began to think himself in great Danger, and to reflect somewhat more seriously upon his Folly, and past ill-spent Time. And tho' he could not help conceiving Hopes of Life being saved; yet he seemed to be upon the Stoole of Repentance, resign'd himself a Sacrifice of his Fate, and applied himself to Preparation for Eternity. One of the last Things I said to Twinbrow was to ask him, whether he knew of those two Men coming that Road with a Sum of Money about them? To which he replied, As he was a dying Man he did not know any thing of them till he met them, nor did he, when he stopped them, expect to find any such Sum as he did.</p>
            <p>On Friday Evening last I received a Letter from Janeway's Coffee-house, Cornhill, in which was inclosed an exhortatory Epistle, which I was desired to let Twinbrow have a Sight of: On Saturday Morning I shewed it him, and read it with him, and it contained wholsome Advice sent him from one who subscribed himself</p>
            <p>Your former Neighbour.</p>
            <p>It desired an Answer directed to Janeway's Coffee-house, which was sent, and was as follows:</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>July 4, 1753.</p>
            <p>I Received your's, though you are unknown to me. I humbly thank you for your good Advice, and shall endeavour the few Moments I have left to make the best Use of it. The Crime I am to die for I was really guilty of, and deserve Death, which I hope will be a Warning to all young People. And I beg, as they tender the Salvation of their own Souls, to shun bad Company, and undutifulness to their Parents; for these Things are the first Steps to Ruin. I hope every one forgives me what I have done to injure them; as I forgive every one that injured me, as I expect Forgiveness from the Almighty.</p>
            <p>From my Cell in Newgate.</p>
            <p>P. S. I hope the World will never reflect on those I have left behind me, for had I taken the Advice of my Parents and Friends, I had not brought myself under these Misfortunes.</p>

He and his Wife were very much reduced, he said; and he being obliged to keep out of Sight for fear of being arrested, could get no Business to support them; so at length he resolved to go upon the Highway, either to get Money, orloose his Life, not much concerned about which might be the Consequence of so rash a Resolution.</p>
