            <p>When under Sentence, I instructed them, how to perform the duty of true Repentance, from these Words. Except ye Repent says our Saviour, you shall all likewise Perish, St. Luke 13. 3. When Christ sends out his Apostles to Proclaim remission of Sins, and other benefits purchas'd by his Death to all the World; he makes this the Terms wherein they are to be tendred. Preach repentance and remission of Sins, says he, in my name to all Nations, beginning at Jerusalem, St. Luke. 24. 47. Christ never</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173402110004"/>
            <p>died to procure Men a liberty to Sin, and to purchase benefits and rewards for evil doers; no, his great design was to destroy Sin, and to draw Men on to Obedience and Repentance, by the gracious offers of Pardon and Acceptance, So that as for all the promises of the Gospel, the Salvation which they encourage, is plainly this deliverance from our Sins, that being the very thing which all the good things of the Gospel are promised to.</p>
            <p>I show'd them also, altho' God had not told us that all the promises of the next Life run upon condition of Men's repentance and reformation here in this; yet the very Nature of the Things themselves, would sufficiently suggest it to us. For the happiness of the next Life cannot be enjoyed by wicked Men; there is an impossibility in the Thing; eternal happiness, and an unholy Soul, are things inconsistent; so that till Men have mortified their wicked Lusts, and are deliver'd from their Sins, they are not capable to partake of it; for the great happiness of the beatifick Vision; St. John tells us, is to change us into God's Image, and to transform us into his likeness; when he appears, saith he, we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is, 1. John 3. 2. Now this Image of God, as St. Paul tells us, consists in righteousness and true holiness, Eph. 4. 24. God has made our Duty to be only a transcript of his own perfections; he requires no more of us than to be such as he is himself, that we may be meet to live with him, and take delight in him for ever and ever. So I inform'd them, if they expected to enjoy God, in being like him in the next World, they must study to be vertuous and conformable to his Image, here in this; since we have no share of his likeness, as long as we wallow in Sin and Wickedness; and so far as we are unlike, we are uncapable, if he should be suppos'd to give way to it never so much of partaking in that happiness, which consists in our likeness, and resemblance to him, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They having all been convicted of Robbery and Theft, I expos'd to them the Heinousness of those grievous Crimes, how inconsistent they are with human Society, how odious to God, adverse to his Laws, and that those who commit such Things are avow'd Enemies to all Mankind; and therefore I exhorted them patiently to submit to the legal Punishment, since, why should a living Man complain,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173402110005"/>
            <p>a Man for the Punishment of his Sins? And in order to evite eternal Misery in the next World, which their Sins deserv'd, I advis'd them to search and try their Ways, and turn themselves unto God, from whom they had so deeply revolted.</p>
            <p>To prepare them for Death, and the Blessedness of a future Life, I explain'd to them the Nature of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, in which we have the Body and Blood of Christ represented to us in a lively Manner, and partake in Christ's Sufferings and Death, in assurance of eternal Life thereby purchased to us.</p>

He lamented much that he had misimproved his Education to the worst Purposes, having been a Disgrace to his Friends and Relations; he was a daring bold Fellow, capable of the most desperate villainous Actions. He confest himself one of the greatest Sinners, being guilty of all Sins almost, excepting Murther, for he abhorted Blood-shed, he behaved better than the most of his Companions.

He was careful of Religious Duties, behav'd better than most of them, and read in the Cell to Cotterell, who was ve illiterate. When at Liberty, he was not of such a wicked Life, as many of them are, but commonly kept the Church, and took the Sacrament sometimes; but of late, keeping Company with none but the worst of Blackguards and abandon'd People, he was wholly given-up to a reprobate Sense, neglected all Publick and Private Worship, and did scarce any Thing that was good, but was perpetually intent upon Mischief. He lamented for his poor Wife and Children, and the Disgrace his ignominious Death would be on them and his other Relations. He said, his Wife was a very honest Woman, and knew nothing of his wicked Doings. He acknowledg'd the Justice of his Sentence, and that God had in Justice afflicted him. He declar'd, That be sincerely repented of the many heinous Sins of his Life, that he believ'd in Jesus Christ, as the Son of God, and only Saviour of Sinners; and that he forgave all Injuries, as he expected Forgiveness from God.</p>

He said he was one of the three that rob'd the York Coach this Side of Hatfield, from which they took some Money, a gold Ring, and a gold Pair of Buttons; he and the aforesaid rob'd the Rochester Coach this Side of Dartford, from the Passengers they took about 10 l. a Diamond Ring, and a Pair of gold Buttons, and from the Coachman a silver Watch.</p>
            <p>He and the aforesaid rob'd the Northampton Coach this Side Mash-Mins-Wash, and took from the Passengers about 5 or 6 l. in Gold and Silver, and gave the Coachman 2 s. 6 d. to drink our Healths, and then made the best of our Way for London; but this Side of Acton meeting with the Uxbridge Coach, they rob'd it, and took from the Passengers about 5 l. in Gold and Silver, two silk Purses, and a silver Watch.</p>
            <p>The next Day, in Company with one Man more, he rob'd a Gentleman's Coach of nine Guineas, and some Silver, but being too near the Town, made the best of their way for London, for fear of being pursued.</p>
            <p>The Night following he rob'd the Hampstead Coach, and one other Coach, from the two Coaches he said he took about 5 l. and a Watch; and about five Weeks before he was taken he rob'd the Hampstead Coach again, and took from the Passengers about nine Pounds in Gold and Silver, a silver Watch, and a gold Ring. The same Week, in Company with one more, he said he rob'd a Man on Horseback, coming from Grimsted-Market, of some Silver, but was pursued by the People coming from Market, and others, so that they was forc'd to quit their Horses and make their Escape over Fields; the last Robbery, and for which he said he died for, was for robbing Madam Cox of one Guinea, and 10 or 12 Shillings in Silver, and a silk Purse; he said he had forgot to mention the Robbery at <placeName id="OA17340211-geo-59">

            <p>thank God, he did not hurt the Gentleman in the Coach: All these Robberies he said he committed in about 14 Months Time, for which he said he begg'd God's Pardon, and all Mankind whom he had injured, and was pleas'd to think he had not kill'd any Person.</p>
            <p>He hop'd that all young Men would take Warning by his ignominious Death, and obey their Parents, and take their Advice; for they would find the Comfort of it, which if he had done, he would not himself have been brought to this untimely End; and that he hop'd his good God would have Mercy upon, and forgive him his Sins (which are many) thro' the Merits of our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

            <p>' to shut out from my Thoughts ' all temporal Concerns; yet I ' could not compose my Mind ' with that Quietness with which ' I hope to pass from this sinful ' World, into the Presence of the ' Almighty, before I had thus exhorted you to take particular ' Warning from my Death, which ' the Intent of the Law, to deter ' others from Wickedness, hath ' decreed to be in a publick and ' ignominious Manner.</p>
            <p>' Let the sad Example of me, ' who died by the Hand of Justice, deter you not only from ' those flagrant Offences, which ' has been so fatal to me; but also ' from those foolish and sinful Pleasures, in which it is but too frequent for young Persons to indulge themselves. Remember that ' I tell you from sad Experience, ' that the Wages of Sin, though ' in Appearance they be sometimes ' large, and what may promise outward Pleasures; yet are they attended with such inward Disquiet, ' as renders it impossible for those ' who have received them, to enjoy either Quiet or Ease. Work ' hard at your Employment, and ' be assured, that Sixpence got ' thereby, will afford you more solid Satisfaction, than the largest ' Acquisitions, at the Expence of ' your Conscience. That God may ' by his Grace, enable you to follow this my last Advice, and ' that he may bless your honest ' Labour with Plenty and Prosperity, is the earnest Prayers of ' your Dying Friend,</p>

            <p>'Tis well known by Physicians, and too sensibly felt by Patients,</p>
            <p>THAT of all the Gleetings and Weaknesses complained of, there is none does, or can so grievously relax and doblicate the generative Faculties and Parts, or drain and reduce the bodily Strength, as those excessive involuntary, seminal Emissions, call'd nocturnal Pollutions, which Numbers of Youth, and Men also that live single, (occasioned chiefly throughly thro' their own Follies) are so disturb'd with a Nights in their Sleep.</p>
            <p>And if they are very frequent, as well as profuse, (as in some almost every Night) they draw off the radical Moisture so fast, in robbing the Blood of its balmy Parts which should nourish it, that it vastly impairs Nature, weakens the Nerves, Brain, and Intellects; lowers the Spirits, brings on Anxieties of Mind, Pains in the Back, Impotencies, and Infertilities; and, if not timely restrained, Decays of Flesh and Strength, and, at the long run, Consumptions; more especially if the Blood be sharp and thin, and the Seminals overrelaxed and forced, from a too early and often abusing them, (as is most commonly the Case) by the parnicious filthy Practice of Self-Pollution.</p>
            <p>And as there many under these weakening Disorders, who are at a Loss to get Help not knowing where to apply for Cure,) some of whom perhaps have tryed every thing, ad gone thro' various Courses of Physick, for Months together, at a considerable Expence, in vain, to their great Concern and Uneasiness, and would gladly be strengthened and restored if they knew how) the Physician, who publishes this, thought it a Service to such, to let them know that he prepares a Correcting, Corroborating ELIXIR, which he has long experienc'd in these particular Cases to have never disappointed him, notwithstanding the known Difficulty of these Cures, but whenever successful, even in the very worst of them, and that with a single Bottle of it only, when no other Medicines would avail.</p>
            <p>For it not only restrains, as it does in a most safe and wonderful Manner; these preternatural Emissions, but regulates all the Juices, and recovers, and restores Nature, by nourishing and enriching the impoverish'd Blood, braving up and strength'ning the debilitated Nerves, raising and enlivening the depress'd Spirits, quickening the clouded Intellects, and bringing the weakned seminal and genital Vessels and Parts, into their right Disposition and Order, by giving, as it were, fresh Life and Vigour to the whole Constitution.</p>
            <p>And has left it to be dispos'd of, at Mr. West's, a Goldsmith, at the Seven Stars, over-against the Sun Tavern, in the Old-Baily, at Half a Guinea the Bottle, with Directions, sealed up ready for any Messenger, upon only asking for a Bottle of Elixir.</p>
            <p>Note, it has the same sure and safe Effects in all other Seminal Weaknesses and Gleetings whatever, which could those that stand in need of Help therein, but be made as sensible of before, as they will be upon their trying it, (as Numbers cured by it are) they would readily and thankfully too apply to it.</p>
