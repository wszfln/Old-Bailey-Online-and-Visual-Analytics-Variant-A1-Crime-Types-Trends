            <p>While they were under Sentence, they were instructed in the Duty of confessing their Sins, from these Words, Confess your Faults one to another, Jam. v. 16. and from the Example of Achan, Josh. vii. 19. And Joshua said unto Achan, my</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173807190003"/>
            <p>Son give, I pray thee, Glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make Confession unto him, and tell me now what thou hast done, hide it not from me. And Achan answered Joshua and said, indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and tus have I done.</p>
            <p>From these Texts I show'd them the Necessity of confessing their Sins, 1st, to God, and 2dly, in Case of notorious Offences, we ought to confess our Sins to Man, whom we have in divers Respects injur'd, and this we have confirm'd by the Apostolical Precept, Confess your Faults, i. e your Sins, to one another, and by the Example of Joshua, who commanded Achan the Troubler of the Camp of Israel, to confess his great Crime of transgressing the express Command of God before he died, by the Hand of Justice for his Iniquity; and this Exhortation Achan comply'd with, by which Means he ded with the greater Peace of Mind, as having confest and begg'd Pardon of God and Man, before he went hence, and was no more. 3dly, The Necessity of true confessing our Sins to God and Man is evident, from the good Effects that are consequent thereon; it tends to give us inward Peace of Mind, and is a Token of the Sincerity of our Repentance.</p>
            <p>I represented to them the absolute Necessity of turning unto God with all their Hearts, of loving God with the whole Heart, Soul, Strength and Mind, of hating all Sin, especially those Sins which had brought them into so much Shame and Sorrow; and that it was altogether necessary to become holy in Heart and in Life, in Soul, in Body, and in Spirit, Since without Holiness no Man can see the Lord, Heb. xii. 14.</p>
            <p>They were inform'd, that whatever Duties they perform'd, they were all to be done with our Eyes fixed upon Christ, in whom alone God is well pleased, in whom all the Promises of God are yea, and in him, Amen, unto the Glory of God by us. 2 Cor. i. 20.</p>

This I illustrated by the dismal Consequences of this Sin in Cain, the first Murderer; David, who in other Respects, was a good, religious Man, Manasseh King of Judah, &amp;c. I insisted upon the Aggravations of his Crime in particular, he having murther'd a Man, his Neighbour and Acquaintance, with whom he had no Difference, and one who had not offended him: All this he own'd, and expressed the greatest Grief and Sorrow for his Crime, promising by God's Grace, to double his Diligence in working out his Soul's Salvation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I exposed to them their great Sin of revolting from God, and how necessary it was to renew their Baptismal Vows, by participating in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, wherein Christ's Death and Sufferings are represented to us in a lively, significant, and familiar Manner, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>THE Case of this unhappy Person being very uncommon, and entirely different from that of the many Criminals, who are the usual Subject of these Papers, we thought it might not be amiss to give the World what Account we have been able to get, with Relation to him in particular.</p>
            <p>He was born of Parents, who profess'd themselves Quakers; and at a proper Age, was put to</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173807190011"/>
            <p>a <rs id="OA17380719-occupation-32" type="occupation">Shoe maker</rs>

                     targets="OA17380719n75-1 OA17380719-occupation-32"/>, by which Business he has hitherto maintain'd himself. From a Child, he was uncommonly serious, and not a little inclin'd to Melancholy. When he arriv'd at some Degree of Maturity of Judgment, he set himself to a careful Reading the Scriptures, especially the New Testament, and soon became dissatisfy'd with the Tenets of the Religion he was brought up in the Profession of. He was convinced of the absolute Necessity of Baptism, and the Obligation he was under (from the Command of Christ) to commemorate his Sufferings and dying Love to Mankind, in the Institution of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper. These Convictions led him to associate himself with some rigid Predestinarians, whose uncomfortable Notions relating to the absolute Decrees of God, Election and Reprobation, he greedily imbibed, as they were suited to his gloomy, melancholy Temper.</p>
            <p>Among these mistaken People he settled, and after some Continuance with them, he was baptized, and receiv'd the Sacrament. And now being convinced of the Truth of the Doctrine of Election and eternal Reprobation, such Scruples as must necessarily arise from thence, in the Mind of every considerate Person, began to fill his already too gloomy Mind with Horror and Perplexity. Tho' he never was guilty of any gross Enormities, but on the contrary, had liv'd a sober, inoffensive Life, yet he could not help thinking himself too great a Sinner to be one of the happy Number whom God had fore ordain'd and elected to eternal Happiness. Upon this, tormenting Reflections wrack'd his Soul, such Reflections as naturally follow the Belief of this Doctrine, so uncomfortable to the poor Creatures of God, and so unworthy of him. He revolv'd in his Mind his many Failings in his Duty, which confirm'd him in his Opinion that he was a Cast-away; and being throughly persuaded of it, he thought it would be to no Purpose to aim at pleasing God, and that all his Endeavours to serve him, and secure his own Happiness, would be to no Purpose; nor would they be accepted by the supreme Being, from one, whom he had (from all Eternity) devoted to Destruction. That therefore it would be as well for him, to throw off all Regard to Religion and Duty, since his utmost Care, and his most conscientious Behaviour, could not reverse God's eternal Decree concerning him. And among his Friends he has often express'd himself to this Purpose; but possess'd with a Dread, and Fear of offending his Maker, he never broke out into any open Commission of Wickedness.</p>
            <p>For some Time he bore the Burden of Life, under these continual Terrors of Mind, 'till weary of the Load, and even wishing to know the worst of his design'd Portion, he was tempted to lay violent Hands upon himself, and under the Force of this Temptation he made several Attempts to destroy himself; in some of which he was prevented by others, and in some, by the Dictates of his own Conscience, which represented to him the Heinousness of this Crime. But the Uneasiness of his Mind still increasing, a Life being grown insupportable, yet not daring to destroy Life with his own Hands, he meditated, and put in Execution, the Project relating to Mr. * Rawlinson's House, not with any Design that it should take Effect, or with any Intention to prejudice him, but that, by attempting the Thing, he might be rid of his Life by the Hands of another. For this Fact he was try'd, and the Jury taking the Depositions of the Witnesses who appear'd for for him, and his Confession before the Magistrate who committed him, into Consideration, they acquitted him.</p>
            <p>Upon his Discharge, his Friends endeavour'd to bring him to a more easy State, and to reason him into some Degree of Contentment; but as they were all of them in the same Way of thinking, with Respect to these Doctrines, they were very improper Persons to remove his truly unsurmountable Scruples, and all their Advice was but like preaching Patience and Resignation to a Man doom'd to languish in the burning Agonies of a continual Fever.</p>
            <p>However, he wore away the Time, till now, more weary of Life, he resolved to do the Thing effectually, and for that Purpose wrote the Letter to Mr. Dolley, and himself was the Bearer. And tho' Mr. Dolley was not at Home, yet he deliver'd the Letter to his Servant, and without any Compulsion, staid till Mr. Dolley came and seiz'd him; the Consequences of this Action, were Commitment, Trial and Conviction. For the Particulars of which we must refer our Readers to the printed Trial in the last Sessions Book.</p>
            <p>See his Trial for that Fact, Sessions Book, No IV. 1737. p. 94.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173807190012"/>
            <p>While he was under Sentence of Death, a sober Clergyman hearing of his melancholy Circumstances, was so kind as to go and talk to him. He asked him, what was the Inducement to his committing this Fact? Wright answer'd, Sir, my Life is, and has been a great while a heavy Burden to me; and upon the Word of a dying Man, I never intended to get any Money by this Design; but the Burden of my Mind, is what I cannot bear, and is it not better to fall by the Hand of another, than to lay violent Hands on one's self? He was asked, what was the Cause that his Life was thus burdensome to him? He answer'd, because he was convinced that he was decreed to be a Vessel of Wrath, in whom God would shew forth his Justice and Vengeance; and to prove this, he mention'd that Text, - He that believeth shall be sav'd; but he that believeth not, is condemn'd already. Why! (says the Minister) do you not believe that Christ came into the World to save Sinners; and that he came to seek and to save that which is lost? Yes, (he reply'd) but that's no Comfort to me; Christ came to save his elected Ones, and to them he is precious; but I, who am ordain'd to Destruction, can receive no Benefit from the Attonement he made by his Death and Sufferings for the Sins of his People. He was immediately asked, what Reason he had to conclude himself predestinated to Damnation? Because (says he) I am taught from the Word of God, that he that is born of God committeth not Sin; and tho' I have not been guilty of gross Sins, yet I am sensible, too sensible that I Sin daily and hourly; and no Thanks to me, that I have not broke out into the Commission of notorious Crimes; 'tis God's Grace, that hath kept me from that, 'tis not owing to any Goodness of mine. It was then represented to him, that this was a State of Imperfection; and that no Man liv'd and sinned not: That the Words he had mention'd, viz. He that is born of God sinneth not, could not be so understood as to imply Perfection, but rather, that a good Man could not live in an indulged Habit of Vice, nor persist in a habitual Course of Wickedness; that his Frailties and Imperfections were his Trouble, and which no meer Man could entirely be freed from, while he liv'd in a World of Sense, and carry'd about him a frail Body. Instance from Scripture were mention'd to him, and many Arguments were made use of to bring him to a better State of Mind, but to little Purpose: After all that was said to him, he sigh'd, and wish'd for David's and Peter's Repentance, and imputed their Acceptance and Recovery, to their Election, which Doctrine he desired might not be touched upon, because he was as throughly assured of the Truth of it, as he was that he had Eyes in his Head.</p>
            <p>From hence 'tis no difficult Thing to discover the Source of this unhappy Creatures Troubles: His Mind seems full of Anxiety, and he to labour under such direful Apprehensions, as to make him weary of Life, and even willing to know the worst of his Condition with Regard to Futurity.</p>

            <p>Soon after their Return from Transportation, they got acquainted with I - ;, A - t, and A - n, and with them Johnson immediately fell upon the Chiving-Lay.* For this Purpose they all equipped themselves like Gentlemen, with lac'd Hats and Swords, and never fail'd appearing at all Public Assemblies, Balls, and even Churches where they exqected a Throng, and while one or two of the Gang stood Bulk, (that is, standing before the Person that was to be robbed) the other would cut a Girdle in two, and draw it off gently; or whip off the Tail of a rich Gown; and to prevent Discovery, would immediately shift it away into the Hands of another, to carry off. Johnson was a Fellow of the utmost Caution, and whatever Diamond Buckles came to his Share, he, to prevent Discovery, always broke to Pieces, and taking out the Diamonds, would sell them by Weight. For this Purpose when he had got a Parcel he used to appoint a certain Jew to meet him at <persName id="OA17380719n109-1">

            <p>At the Season of the Year when Masquerades and Assemblies were not so frequent, Johnson and his Companions used to travel the Countries, even an 100 Miles from London; those of them that could talk best travell'd as 'Squires, the others in Liveries as their Footmen. It was their Custom always to put up at the best Inn in the Town they visited, and live elegantly for a Fortnight, three Weeks, or a Month (as their Business could be accomplish'd) and by entertaining the Landlord, and People that knew the Country, would discover what Farmers or Country People had Money by them. When they had learn'd this, they would by some Means or other (if it was possible) make themselves and their Equipages be taken Notice of by those they intended to bite, and when that was done, they used to send a Footman (in which Quality Johnson generally assisted on these Occasions) to desire the Country Man or Farmer would let the 'Squire his Master speak with him. When the Farmer came, the 'Squires had always their Tale ready, - " That they were come down to " see an Estate at such a Place, with which they " were so well pleased, that they bargain'd for it, " and were to pay down so much Money; but not " having Cash enough in the Country with them, " except they parted with some old Family Pieces " (which they would not willing dispose of) they " made bold to ask him if he car'd to lend them " such a Sum for a valuable Consideration, and if " he would assure them that the Family Pieces " should be forth-coming upon the Re-payment " of the Money, they should be told over to him " and seal'd up, and they should be deposited in " his Hands for his Security." The Farmers upon the Sight of the Broad Pieces, which were to be lodged with them as a Pledge, generally brought out their Money, upon which one of the Cheats would very carefully seal up the old Gold in a Green Velvet Purse, and with many Desires they might be ready for the 'Squire when he sent for them again, by Dexterity of Hand, another Purse, (which they had ready on these Occasions) made up and seal'd exactly like the other, was palm'd upon the Farmer, with Half-pence and Half-Crowns in it.</p>
            <p>By these Means they have boasted they have gotten upwards of 2000 l. among them in a small Compass of Time; and by offering such Pledges as these, and allowing half a Guinea for the Use of a small Sum, till the 'Squires got Home, they have got Money from poor Country People, which has been fetch'd out of Holes in a Chimney behind the Ashes, by Persons, the Smell of whose Dirt and Nastiness has so offended the 'Squires, and even their Footmen, that they have said, they have been all obliged to hold their Noses while they were triking them of their Money.</p>
            <p>Thus they would travel the Countries for Months together, and when they had collected what they could, they used to come within 5 or 6 Miles of London, and send for their Wives to come to them, and take the Money, that they might take a fresh Course for more.</p>
            <p>In this Manner Johnson lived many Years, and except when he was out upon Business, he always kept himself very close, and was very shy of be</p>
            <p>* The Chiving-Lay is to frequent Masquerades, Balls, Assemblies, Installations and Places resorted to by Ladies of Quality, where by the Assistance of the Gang, the Ladies Girdles are cut with a keen Lancet or Penknife, and by drawing them off they often get a rich Buckle, and frequently a Gold Watch, &amp;c.</p>

His Defence upon his Trial was very trifling and insignificant, and rather confirmed, than removed, the Circumstances of Guilt he appeared under at the Bar; of which he himself seem'd sensible, and therefore rely'd more upon the Character that was given him in Court, by the many reputable Persons who appear'd for that Purpose, than on any Thing he could say in his own Behalf.</p>
            <p>When he was brought up (on Saturday) to receive his Sentence, he read the following Lines, from a Paper he had in his Hat; which were tasten from his Mouth, by the Person that took down his Trial.</p>
            <p>May it please your Lordship!</p>
            <p>" This my most melancholy Case was occasion'd by the alone inconsiderate Rashness of my " unexperienced Years. The Intent of Fraud, " is without Doubt strongly, and most plainly " proved against me But I assure your Lordship, I neither wanted nor abounded, and in " my Life, I never had any Thought tending to " willful Injustice, 'till a few Minutes before the " immediate Execution of this rash Deed. I hope " your Lordship has some Regard for the Gentlemen who have so generously appear'd in myLoking Goods, is selling them outright to Persons who make it their Business to buy and dispose of stolen Goods.</p>

            <p>After Sentence, he was confined in a Cell; and till the Dead Warrant came down, he had no Belief that he should die; but seem'd pretty confident that the Intercession of his Acquaintance would prove effectual, to the saving his Life; nor was he without Hope even after he knew he was appointed to die. A Gentleman discover'd to him, that he was one of this unhappy Number, on the Evening of the Day the Report was made. He receiv'd the melancholy News with some Emotion, and seem'd at first to be very much shock'd. But recollecting and composing himself, he said, - God's Will be done. And bursting into Tears, he bewail'd the Concern his Mother must feel, when she should hear his Doom; and mourn'd, that she, who had been so tender of him, should live to see him made a Spectacle to the World by such a shameful Death; and that he should be the wicked Occasion of bringing her grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave.</p>
            <p>When she receiv'd the dreadful Tidings of her Son's wretched Circumstances, she set out from Chichester with a Heart over-whelm'd with Sorrow: And when she arriv'd in London, it was a Week before the Load of Grief she was under, would suffer her to see her unhappy condemned Child. On Saturday the 8th Instant, was their first Interview: And she, upon Sight of her Son in that miserable Condition, with Difficulty was prevented from swooning; while the Son stood, a mournful Spectator of his Mother's Distress. When she had recover'd herself a little, she fell on his Neck - He dropt down on his Knees and threw his Arms round his aged Mother's Neck, imploring her Blessing, and Forgiveness of his Folly, in bringing himself and her to Disgrace. The moving Scene drew Tears from the Eyes of those who were accustom'd to Scenes of Black, Distress and Death. The Evening before his Execution she took her last Leave of him, under all the Distress that a tender Parent must feel, for a beloved and only Child under such direful Circumstances.</p>

            <p>Most Honoured and worthy Sir,</p>
            <p>I Beg you'd excuse this Freedom, but my unhappy Circumstances are such, as oblige me to be thus troublesome, and I do now stand in great Need of your Pity, Compassion, and generous Assistance, in this my most deplorable Case; tho' I confess with Shame, I intended to wrong you, nay, basely to have wrong'd you, and with Pleasure I shall resign myself to Death, to make Attonement for the Injury, which is all the Restitution I am able to make. And from my Soul I do forgive every Person that was any ways accessary to my Prosecution, as I expect Forgiveness from the Great God, and Judge of my Soul, which is now standing on the very Brink of Eternity. Oh! good Sir! Let the Cries and Tears of my Mother, an almost distracted Widow, prevail on you to grant me your Assistance; she is inconsolable, and so overwhelm'd with Grief, that she cannot see me, nor hath not been with me, tho' she has been in Town this Week past. I am so unfortunate as to be included in the Dead Warrant, and am order'd for Execution on Wednesday next; therefore I humbly hope you will lend me your Assistance in this my great Extremity, that my Execution may be respired for a little Time, and that I may not be hurry'd out of the World, into an awful Eternity, in so short a Time, to the immediate Destruction both of my Soul and Body. I have not Sir, been in Prison but little more than a Fortnight, and what a Hardship it is that I, in the Prime of my Years, should be so suddenly taken out of the World, by a shameful and ignominous Death, with all my Load of Sins about me unrepented of, to the eternal Destruction both of my Soul and Body, to the Disgrace of my Family, and the Dishonour of my Friends, and my Country, only for writing a Line or two, and no Body has been injur'd by it, tho' I must acknowledge my Intention was to have done it, and therefore in the Eye of the Law my Crime is the same. But as it was my first Fact, tho' my Offence is of so deep a dye, yet I hope my tender Years may move your Pity. I assure your Honour, that I never in my Life was guilty either by Word or Action, of injuring any Man, till the immediate Execution of this rash Deed; and for which I am willing to suffer, in Case I may have a little more Time to make my Intercession to God, for the Forgiveness of my Sins, as I freely forgive all Mankind. Oh, Sir! consider what a horrible Thing it is to appear loaded with Guilt,</p>

But, Ladies, for your clearer understanding my Case, I have herewith sent you the Sessions Book, in which, (I cannot but confess) my Trial is inserted in a very exact Manner. When my Trial was over, the Jury, (on Account of my Youth, and the Character the Gentlemen gave me) recommended me to the Favour of the Court, but how far that will have Effect, Time only must discover. In this my most deplorable Condition, I have made Application to - and to - and the Prosecutor and other proper Persons have sign'd two Petitions. One of which was sent down to Chichester, in order to get some Gentlemen's Hands to it, but to my great Surprize and unspeakable Misfortune it was return'd without any one Hand to it. The Reason of which I am an entire Stranger to; but am induced to think, that it proceeded in a great Measure from the ill Conduct of the Person who was sent with it, and from his irregular Proceeding, in making his Application. This, Ladies, is as concise an Abstract of my deplorable Misfortune as possible. I could have been much more brief, (more particular) was I not fearful of giving you too much Trouble; therefore I earnestly beg your Assistance, and your Interest with M -, which I am perswaded will be of great Service.</p>
            <p>I am informed by Mr T - that the M - and D &#8211; R - will do me all the Service they can. But these Circumstances are very precarious; yet upon them my Life depends, and I am very fearful of the Event, because I am convicted in so unhappy a Time; for there are no less than 16 poor unhappy Creatures under Sentence, and three of us are for Forgery. Tho' the Cases of the other two differ somewhat from mine, for they drew several Bills upon Mr. Hoare, and actually receiv'd several large Sums, with which they went off. The Bankers in general will, to be sure, be against us all; but yet, I hope you Endeavours will succeed in my Favour, and that I shall have the unspeakable Pleasure of assuring you, in Person, that I shall always look on myself as under a lasting Obligation to pray for you I am, Ladies,</p>

She hopes (if she can possibly) to come To-morrow; if she can, she will. My dear Friend, I hope we shall have the Happiness of seeing you in Person very soon, out of that unhappy Place. Pray God it may be so. All your Friends are in great Hopes of seeing you at Liberty very soon. Miss H - will do what she can; she was to come to see you Yesterday, but something fell out, that she could not possibly. Miss G - gives her Love and Service to you, with Tears in her Eyes, and please to accept the the same from your Well-wisher,</p>
            <p>My dear Friend,</p>
