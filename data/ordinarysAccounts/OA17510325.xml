He refused, he says, at first, but they told him he should have Part of the Money, if he could get a Price for him, and they would rather he should have the selling of him than themselves.

Their Passage was paid accordingly by the said Agents, to the Commander of a Ship bound to that Island; as appears by a Writing to that Purpose, which he left with me before the Day of his Death. He was however now exceedingly poor, and being unable to pay the Evidence, Mr. Gee, a Debt of 17 s. which he had contracted for Lodging, &amp;c. for Wife and Children, and fearing to be stopt in his intended Voyage, he says, he inserted an Advertisement in the Daily Advertiser, setting forth his Want, and desiring the Assistance of the Humane, in order to make some small Provision for his Children in the Voyage, better than the Ship's Allowance; but nothing proceeding from that Advertisement, his Thoughts suggested to him, and he was tempted to forge a Draught on <rs id="OA17510325-occupation-18" type="occupation">Sir</rs>

This once more stript him of every Thing he had; he therefore came up to Town to attempt a third Fraud, which caused his being apprehended. If he had succeeded in that, he says, that he intended to have set out for Bristol, to prevent other Arrests, to have gone for Ireland, and waited at Cork for the Ship, which he knew was to touch there. This is the Purport of that Account which, according to Tuesday's Daily Advertiser, he advertised he had given to me under his own Hand-writing.</p>
            <p>When Boroughs came to live with the worthy Alderman before-mention'd, the Question was put to him, whether he was a single or a married Man? He pretended to be a single Man; but after some Time it appeared to the contrary, and it was known in the House that he was married; and this is declared to be the only Cause why he was discharged from that Gentleman's Clerkship.</p>

            <p>Boroughs was therefore recommended by his late Master to Mr. Revil, as a Person of whom he had a good Opinion;nor does it appear, that during the Time of his being in that Gentleman's Service, (of whom he speaks with the utmost Respect) there was Room for any Imputation or Charge against him of Dishonesty, or Want of Attention to Business; and as far as I can learn, some Disagreement between Boroughs and some of the Servants of the same House was the only Cause of his being discharged from thence.</p>
            <p>That he laboured under great Hardships after he left Mr. Revil's Service, is certainly very true, as I was informed by some that were slender Acquaintance of his; who were so far Witnesses of it, as to have him come to them, and apply for a Morsel of Meat, and a Draught of Beer; with which they, seeing his Necessity, were charitably induced to supply him. His Necessities brought on Family Uneasinesses, which drove him to that too common Error of endeavouring to ease it by drinking; which was a Fault his Weakness made him too liable to. It was a hard Struggle for him to reconcile himself to his Fate, but at length he became quite calm and composed, under the Thoughts of its nearer Approaches, acknowledging the Justice of his Suffering, and earnestly entreating Forgiveness from God and Man for all his aggravated Crimes and Transgressions.</p>

It greatly surprized Mr. Carr to see so many excellent Charms exposed and unattended; he immediately alighted from his Horse, already deeply smitten with her Charms, and offering her his Hand she accepted it, and handing her into the Inn could not bear a Separation, and therefore proposed that they might all sup together, which was agreed to; and while Supper was preparing, he endeavoured to learn from the Coachman, who she was, but to no Purpose; all the Information he could get was, that he took in the Lady at Dublin, and was going to the Spaw at Mallow, he found himself extremely uneasy in his Mind, this being the first Time that he was ever inspired with the Symptoms of Love.</p>

The Lady advised Mr. Carr to get every Thing in readiness for their Voyage, and particularly all the Cash he possibly could raise, in order that her Friends in England might see the Figure they could make. Mr. Carr had a large Sum of Money in the House, which he gave her the Keys off, and in order to raise more, sold some Houses left him by his deceased Relation, and taking up large Sums at an exorbitant Interest, he threw himself at her Feet, and told her she was sole Misterss of him and all he had in the World.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Carr had raised all the Money he could procure, and made up an Equipage agreeable to her Orders, there was nothing more to be done than to procure a Ship; but she took an Opportunity, in his Absence, of making diligent Enquiry if there were any Ships bound for foreign Parts, and ready to sail. She was informed there was one just ready to sail for Amsterdam. She dress'd herself in a Suit of Man's Cloaths she had provided for the Purpose, and went to the Captain of this Vessel, and agreed with him, and sent all Mr. Carr's Luggage and her own Cloaths on Board that very Night; and the Wind offering fair, she prevailed on the Captain to sail with all Speed, giving him a Present for his Compliance; leaving the unfortunate Mr. Carr, destitute of Money, to seek new Adventures.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Carr returned Home, and found that his Lady was gone, and every Thing valuable in his House carried away, what Transports of Rage and Fury he flew into, is almost impossible to describe; but when he came to the Return of his Reason, and knowing that a Search would be ineffectual, and serve rather to manifest his Folly than grant him any Relief; he therefore considered, before his Loss was made publick, it would be more congruous with his Interest to dispose of the Remainder of his Goods, and get as much Money as he could, and leave his native Country with all Expedition. The next Day he applied to a Broker, and received from him near an Hundred Pounds for his Goods, which he set off with directly, in the Packet-Boat, for <placeName id="OA17510325-geo-43">

This Man sold Corks to the Country Inns, and he took Carr in for a Partner. But Carr being a Person of Address, got into Favour with the Partner's Customers, and so one Nail drove out the other.

            <p>He was now become the Sport of these Reprobates and Sycophants, who like Vultures preyed upon him whilst his Money lasted, and when gone, despised and loath'd his Company. His Intrigues had drain'd him of all his Cash; it was now he began to see into his past Folly, and tho' he was bubbled and ensnar'd, yet he thought to shake off Idleness and Debauchery as soon as an Opportunity serv'd. But Carr being even at this Time somewhat acquainted with the Seamens Affairs, began to play his Tricks, and cheated a Friend of his, who intrusted him with a large Sum. His Friend had a Right to receive 60 l. and upwards at the Navy-Office, and sent him to receive it; but Carr thought proper to take it to his own Use; his Friend did not think proper to prosecute him, or he might have stood a bad Chance even at that Time. This went the same Way with the rest, was swallowed up in bad Luck at the Gaming-Table, and now all his Hopes were once more frustrated. He remained in Town a considerable Time, struggling with all the Calamities incident to Poverty and the Want of Money, and after pawning his intire wearing Apparel, which was his last Recourse, he then bethought himself of the only Expedient that could next offer most in his Favour, which was to enter again as a <rs id="OA17510325-occupation-28" type="occupation">Marine</rs>
