            <p>While under Sentence, they were instructed from these Words, The Cup</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174011240003"/>
            <p>which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it? John 18. 11. from which they were desired to observe, that this is a Question, Christ puts to himself; for had he put it to any other, most likely he had been answered in the Negative; but our blessed Redeemer, freely, and willingly drank all that bitter Cup, of God the Father's fiery Wrath and Indignation, in order to attone the divine Justice for the Sins of Mankind. 2dly, Hence they were desired to observe and admire the infinite Love of God the Father, and God the Son, in thus contriving our Redemption, by the Sufferings and Death of that Person, who is God equal to the Father. 3dly, It was observed, That the Afflictions which befall us, are the kind Visitations of our heavenly Father, who knows better what is for our Good and Advantage, than we can do. And 4thly, From these Words, Shall I not drink it? Therefore we ought patiently to submit to the most adverse Dispensations, as proceeding from our beneficent and indulgent Heavenly Father, who will certainly make every Thing work together for Good, to them who sincerely love and obey him.</p>
            <p>As also, to comfort them in the miserable and deplorable Condition they then were in, they were desired to take Notice how the holy Psalmist David, a Prince and mighty King, designs the most flourishing Condition a Man can be in, verily every Man at his best Estate is altogether Vanity. Ps. 39. 5 Man in a low, Man in a middling, in a pretty elevated State of Life, is Vanity, but Man at his best Estate, raised to the Height of Plenty and Affluence, a Man exalted to this high Degree is not simple Vanity, he is more than Vanity, he is altogether Vanity. From this Consideration, they were desired to reflect upon the Vanity and Insufficiency of this World, to which they had been so much addicted, after which they had too much coveted, which was the Occasion of so much Misery and Calamity befalling them. And therefore they were exhorted, while any Time was remaining, while God was still calling them to Repentance, to redeem the very short Time they had to live, and to make up their Peace with God, before they went hence to be seen no more.</p>

Though young in Years, yet his Guilt being of a very deep dye, he was entreated to beg earnestly of God to create a new Heart, and renew a right Spirit within him, since unless he repented, and</p>

The Girl made Answer, a poor Woman, for God's Sake don't meddle with me? Curtis began to be very rude with her, and swore if she did not hold her Tongue he would cut her Throat; upon which she begged and pray'd, and desired him not to use her ill, for she said she was in a sad and deplorable Condition; but all her Intreaties were in vain; Curtis reply'd, Be in what Condition you will, he swore he would - he then, with the Assistance of Duell and the rest, had c - al Knowledge of her, during which Time the poor Creature cry'd out Murder several Times. After this, Davis swore, if she would not let him do as Curtis had done, he would kill her; where upon she cry'd as before, and likewise said, for God's Sake don't kill me! After he had his Desire of her, he was so inhuman and barbarous, as to thrust a Pin, of the length of an Inch and half, into her hinder Part, up to the very Head,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174011240008"/>
            <p>and not being satisfied with that cruel Usage, he likewise beat her after a very unmerciful manner with his Fist; when he had so done, all the remainder had likewise Knowledge of the poor Soul. Not being contented with the ill Treatment with which they used her with, Curtis got upon her again, and swore, if she did not give him what Money she had, either more or less, he would certainly kill her: The Girl reply'd, if you won't kill me, I will give you what Money I have! but she not giving it him so readily, he fell a beating her with both his Hands; after he had so done, he out off her Pocket, and took out of it 2 d. 3 Farthings, and her Pass which she had to travel with. After this barbarous Treatment, they all went to drink together, except Duell, who had no Money, therefore they would not let him go with them, and staid drinking till between 2 o'Clock in the Morning.</p>
            <p>Duell was willing to lessen his Crime in the Eye of the World, because of his Youth; but I inform'd him, his Villainy was of the most blackest die, and that he was the sole Occasion of the whole Tragedy being acted, by bringing the rest, and committing the same Wickedness with them. And to compleat their Barbarity, Curtis alias Tug-mutton, who died the Morning he was to have been tried, went and got a Broom-stick, and thrust it up the poor Woman's Body, which gave her the finishing Stroke to her Sufferings and Miseries; she liv'd some few Days in the greatest Torment and Misery, which no Tongue was able to express, and then expired.</p>
            <p>This Duell was a very obstinate Boy, and likewise of a quarrelsome Nature; for altho' he was under those unhappy Misfortunes, he and his Fellow Sufferer Meers challenged each other to fight, and was a going, but was prevented. I being informed of it, I sharply reprimanded them both; upon which they both promised Amendment, and they did afterwards behave themselves more peaceable. Duell after his Condemnation would not directly own his Guilt; yet after the Dead-Warrant came down for his Execution, he with Tears in his Eyes acknowledged himself guilty of the Rape, Robbery and Murder. He hoped those that were concerned in using the poor Woman so barbarous, may be brought to condign Punishment, which they so justly deserve. He believ'd in Christ, and repented of his Sins, and died in Peace with all the World.</p>

As soon as I came within a few Yards of my Lodgings, I sent my Friend Sally before to see whether my Landlady was up, I being unwilling she should be acquainted with my bringing the Man Home; she soon came back and told me the Coast was clear, and I having a private Key, we let ourselves in, and I desir'd him to step up into my Appartment, and he had not been long there before he fell fast asleep; as soon as I found him safe, I examin'd his Breeches, and I found upwards of ten Guineas in Gold, and some Silver, and not being content with that, I took his Coat, Waistcoat, Breeches, Shoes and Stockings, and locking the Door softly, I went clear off.</p>
            <p>The next Morning I sent Sally to see how Matters stood, she imagining the Man being so much in Liquor over Night that he would know nothing of her when sober. When she came to the House she knocked at the Door, and ask'd for me, and there was the poor Countryman like a Madman, saying he was undone! Undone! swearing that he would hang my Landlady if she did not bring the Woman who took away his Cloaths and Money. Sally came to me, and told me how Affairs stood, and I not caring to be any more thereabouts, took a Lodging near <placeName id="OA17401124-geo-47">

So we liv'd together till all his Money was gone, and then by mutual Consent we parted.</p>

By the Time I got back the Watchmen were going their Rounds, so I stood almost on the opposite side of the Way, when the Watchman came up to him, he looked affrighted, seeing him in that naked Condition, and began to pull and hawl him to make him wake, which</p>

            <p>I once had a Thought of reclaiming, and becoming an honest Woman; but alass, Vice had got such a deep Root in my poor Soul, that whatever Thoughts of Virtue presented themselves to my View when I was sober, one Fit of Drunkenness entirely erradicated; which Vice God forgive me, I was much addicted too, and to which I owe my Ruin. I mention my former Crimes with no Ostentatious View, hoping on the contrary, that all who may read my Catastrophe, will take Warning by my unhappy Example.</p>
            <p>For did they but know and feel within themselves the Horror and Remorse of Conscience I feel for my past Transgressions and Iniquities, for all which I must speedily answer before a just and an offended Deity; how would they pity, alas! and commiserate my now unhappy and deplorable Condition, which through the just Judgment of God has fell so heavily upon me; how have I gloried in my Shame, and despised Reproof? I could sincerely wish that all those unhappy Persons who were Companions of my former Vices, would reflect with themselves, that the Way they are now running on, will sooner or later bring them into my sad State, and then (but too late) what would they give they had in Time reclaimed by seasonable and timely Advice. Thus much I thought incumbent upon me to publish, hoping it may have the desired Effect, which God grant of his infinite Goodness it may.</p>

When he came near Red-lyon-street, he knock'd at a Door, and out came a young Woman, a Maid Servant as I supposed, and asking him what he wanted, as I stood at some Distance I heard him say, that he had brought Mr. Smith's Shoes Home; the Maid told him, Mr. Smith was not at Home, so he desired she would take in the Shoes, which she accordingly did.</p>
            <p>As soon as the Lad came away from the House I follow'd him at some Distance, and at a convenient Opportunity I came up to him, and suddenly clapping him on the Shoulder, Ha! old School-fellow Tom, says I, how goes it, how does your Master do? He turn'd about, Why, says he, I don't know you, my Name is not Tom; No, says I, why don't you live with a Shoemaker? Yes, says he, I do, but my Name is not Tom; Why then pray says I, where do you live, and with whom? Why, says he, my Master's Name is Mr. -, and I live in Shoemaker-Row. This was all I wanted, so asking his Pardon for using him so roughly, I told him I was mistaken, and took my Leave; and going back to the House, I boldly knock'd at the Door, and when the Maid came I pretended to be out of Breath, and ask'd if a Lad had not brought a pair of Shoes there from Mr. - in Shoemaker-Row, she reply'd Yes, Why, says I, he has brought the wrong pair, and Mr. Smith, who they was made for is now in the Shop, storming like a Fury; so the Maid runs backwards in a Hurry to fetch them, and in the mean Time I catch'd up a Shirt which laid just by me, and put it hastily in my Pocket unperceiv'd by her; when she came back to me, There, says she, take them you Rogue and make haste Home, I said I would.

I take this Opportunity to acquaint you, that I sincerely forgive you, as I hope for forgiveness from my much offended Maker, through the Intercession and precious Blood of my blessed Redeemer; and my last Advice is, that my fatal Example may be a Means through the Providence of God, of your Reformation. Oh! do you think it so? and no longer slight the Mercies of a just God; for did you but know the Horors and Remorse I feel for my former Iniquities. How would you, as I now do, wish almost I had never been. If you still continue to run on, notwithstanding all this? what can I say more? why? you'll speedily come to a shameful ignominious, and untimely Death. Oh! repent while you have Time, and God give you Grace so to do. You may perhaps plead Necessity, for I know your Circumstances must be but indifferent; but do you amend your Life, and no Doubt God will amend your Condition.</p>
