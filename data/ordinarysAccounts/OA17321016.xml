                  <interp inst="OA17321016n12-1" type="given" value="JOSEPH"/>Joseph Powis</persName>, had a most gracious Reprieve sent him on Sunday the 8th, Instant for 8 Days, at the expiration of which, the Sentence was Executed upon him.</p>
            <p>He had the benefit of the same Instructions and Exhortations, with the others who died before him, and the time being short to instruct him by himself, I exhorted him mostly to a serious Preparation for Death from these Words, 'Mark 'the perfect man, and behold the 'upright, for the end of that man 'is Peace, Psalm, xxxvii. 37. Or as it is in the old Translation, Keep Innocency, and take Heed to the Thing that is right, for that shall bring a Man Peace at the last. From this I show'd him, that the great Difference betwixt a Life of Sin and Wickedness, and a Life of Piety and Vertue is, that the former consults only our present Interest, but the latter provides for our everlasting well being, and lays a sure Foundation for our everlasting Peace and Happiness. The greatest advantage of a sinful course is to be diverted a little, and pleasantly entertain'd for a small moment; which in comparison of things in the vegetable and sensitive World is very short; but to be balanc'd with Eternity is a meer nothing. Time it self has no proportion to Eternity, much lest that span of it which makes up the Life of Man. Behold, thou hast made my Days as a span-long, and mine is as nothing in respect of thee. Says the Psalmist, Psalm 39. 5. The sum of a sinful Life is, a little momentary Pleasure, at the Expence of a deal of succeeding trouble and Self-condemnation, and there is this great Aggravation of the Folly of Sin, that although some of its Pains are eternal, yet all its Pleasures are but for a Season.</p>
            <p>But it's quite otherwise in the practice of religion and virtue, which secures to us an eternal and never-fading Interest, even everlasting Happiness, and all her paths are Peace, Prov. 3. xvii. But it is her distinguishing Glory, that she brings us true and solid Peace at the last, however an ill combination of accidents may defraud us of the other. For Vice has it's present pleasures as well as Virtue, but herein lies the difference, that Virtue only ends well.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173210160005"/>
            <p>Upon this subject I made it clear to him, that what will bring a Man to Peace at the last, is to be chiefly minded, and most diligently heeded: But a Life of Piety and Virtue will bring a Man Peace at the last: and therefore a Life of Piety and Virtue is to be chiefly minded, and most diligently heeded. As to Peace, at the Hour of Death, tho' none is able to judge of it but those who are concern'd in that dreadful Moment; yet we may take some Measures of it, by considering what it is to die, and how miserable the Condition of those is, who have liv'd so ill, as to want this Peace at the Hour of Death.</p>
            <p>I advised him also to renew his baptismal Covenant with God, by receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which is a Pledge of Christ's Love, and his last Legacy of that everlasting Good-will he bore us.</p>
            <p>While these and many such Exhortations and suitable Instructions were given, he always behav'd christianly and decently, and made regular Responses, and to Appearance he was penitent, at least he professed a deep Repentance for the heinous Sins and Irregularities of his Life, though indeed he did not seem to have such a deep Concern upon his Spirits, as might be thought requisite; yet sometimes he wept and shed Tears, and upon the whole we are to judge charitably of him.</p>

His Father was very kind and indulgent towards him, but he prov'd a most disobedient and perverse Child as ever was born; for after all the gentle Methods his Father could think upon, to put and keep him in a Sober and Christian Way of Thinking and Acting, he did nothing else but abuse the Lenity of a tender Parent, and was so head-strong and irreclaimable in his own foolish Way of Proceeding, that he often lest his Father's House and went</p>

This his obstinate, wilful, and vitious manner of Life, hurried on his Ruin and Destruction apace. He at last committed a Felony, for which he was taken up, imprison'd, convicted, and order'd for Transportation, a little more than one Year ago; yet upon Promise of Amendment and Reformation, and that he would no more addict himself to unwildy and irregular Courses: His Father made Interest to get his Transportation taken off, and had him set at Liberty again. But he still prov'd irreclaimable, for no sooner was he unchain'd, but he apply'd himself to his old idle Way, and got into the Company of wicked Men and Women, who made his Fall unavoidable. Not being willing to work, though he did not commit the most notorious Crimes, such as Murder, breaking Houses, robbing the Streets and Highways, picking of Pockets, and such like; yet to supply himself in his extravagant, unreasonable, and vitious manner of Life, which he loved best, in drinking, idling away his Time with profligate base Fellows, bearing Company to naughty Women, and stroling about the Town and Country, with Mountebanks and such like Gentlemen, who love Ease and Laziness, better than an industrious, virtuous, and constant Application to some honest Trade or Imployment; he stole and pilfer'd whatever he could lay his Hands upon, and sometimes he got into Houses, broke open Locks, and took every thing he could conveniently carry away. He very much lamented his extraordinary Wickedness, especially his great Obstinacy and reiterated Disobedience to a good, kind, indulgent Father, whom, with Tears in his Eyes, and in the greatest Agony and Bitterness of Spirit, he call'd one of the best and most sympathizing and patient Fathers; whereas he own'd himself one of the most obstinate, perverse, and disobedient Sons in the World: Having tir'd out his Father's Patience to such a Degree, that after innumerable Admonitions and Endeavours to bring him to a Sense of his Sin and Duty, still finding him irreclaim</p>

            <p>he began to call, Mr. Brewer, there's some Body in the House, which caus'd me to retreat Backwards, thinking to go out that Way, but found the Back-door strongly secured, so that being in a Fright, I clim'd into a neighbouring Yard, and went under a kind of a Dresser, made of some Boards, resolving to remain there till next Morning, and then go out; and if I was ask'd about it, to tell the People of the House the Truth of the Thing: But I had not been there half a quarter of an Hour, before somebody came into the Yard, and began to pull down the Boards which cover'd me, I upon that put my Head out, and beginning to speak, I was knock'd down, with a Blow of a Club on my Head, which stunn'd me, and before I recover'd my self, they had repeated their Strokes, for I had several Holes and Bruises in my Head; but recovering my Speech, and seeing the Yard full of People, I intreated them to hold their Hands, and if I had done any Crime, punish me according to Law, and not murther me in that inhuman Manner, seeing I made no Resistance, whereupon two Men took hold of my Hands and Collar, and going to lift me up, I felt something go through the Calf of my Leg, and with a repeated Thrust into my right Foot quite to the Bone: I turn'd and saw it was done with an old rusty Sword by Brewer's Man, who made three more Thrusts at me; whereof the first made a superficial Wound upon my Belly the other two went through my Coat's-Sleeve without doing me any farther Damage; and now being prevented by some Strangers, who said it was a Shame to use me so, they took me into the House, and began to search me, and took out of my Pockets some Things, which they made use of to my, Detriment, by swearing that I gave, very unwarrantable Accounts of the Use of them, particularly, a Launcet, which I made use of to bleed People in the Night; whereas I protest, by all my Hopes of Mercy here and hereafter, that being ask'd the Use of the said Launcet, I replied, Word for Word, as I have here set down, that I had for some Time studied Phlebotomy or Blood-letting. Some Persons said likewise, that I said, I wish'd to die of my Wounds before my Trial came on, which was another Circumstance which did me a great Wrong and Injury; all I said was as follows:</p>

Why I shall die of my Wounds before my Trial, and then you'll be all disappointed of your Expectations. However, they were deaf to all I said, and carried me in that Condition to the Compter, about three in the Morning, and I lay bleeding till near Noon, and then was by the Justice committed to <placeName id="OA17321016-geo-25">

            <p>A COPY OF THE LETTER Which I sent to his MAJESTY.</p>
            <p>May it please your Majesty,</p>
            <p>WITH the utmost Humility I presume to lay my self at your Majesty's Royal Feet, imploring Mercy, which unless your Majesty will be graciously pleased to grant, I am irrecoverably lost.</p>
            <p>I am descended of virtuous Parents, who instiled in me early Notions of Religion, Virtue, and Honour, and an Abhorrence of every base and dishonourable Action; and after giving me a liberal Education, enabled me, by an ingenious Occupation, to support my self in a handsome and creditable Manner, without having Recourse to any unlawful Means, and which I have since exercised with so much Diligence as to be thought to excel therein, whereof I have drawn a Draught to prove that I assert the Truth, viz. three Keys.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173210160016"/>
            <p>As to the Crime for which I am condemned, I humbly do assure your Majesty, before Almighty God, who knows my Sincerity herein, that I am intirely innocent thereof, either actionally or intentionally; wherefore I have inclos'd a brief Narrative of the Thing as it really was, that your Majesty may perceive thereby how cruelly I have suffered both in Character and Person.</p>
            <p>I likewise do protest, by all my Hopes of Mercy, that I never was transported, as has been falsely suggested, by order thereby to deprive me of your Majesty's Royal Compassion and Mercy; neither was I ever out of <placeName id="OA17321016-geo-28">

            <p>I most humbly and earnestly beseech your most Sacred Majesty's Pardon for the Stratagem which I rashly presum'd to make use of to gain Respite, precipitated thereunto by the terrible Prospect of approaching Death, who I expected, within a few Hours, would swallow me up; but which I dare not continue, lest I by too great a Provocation of your most Sacred Majesty, render my self incapable, as well as unworthy, of your Royal Mercy.</p>
            <p>I earnestly intreat your Majesty, that Justice may be satisfy'd with the Sacrifice which is already made to her of thirteen poor unhappy Men, who were in the Prime of their Youth and Vigour, cut off from the Society of Mankind, that I may remain a living Monument of your Majesty's Royal Clemency, though even on Conditions of perpetual Banishment.</p>
            <p>And may Almighty God bless your Majesty with Health, and a long and prosperous Life, dreaded by your Enemies abroad, and belov'd by all your Subjects at home; and when it shall please him to give your Majesty in Exchange for this earthly Crown an immortal and uncorruptible Crown of Glory. May there never he wanting some of your most sacred Majesty's Royal Line to fill the Throne, so long as this is a Kingdom, which shall be every Day of my remaining Life, the hearty Prayer of the most unworthy and miserable of your Majesty's Subjects,</p>

When at the Place I went to give him his last Prayers, he asked me the Way to Kensington, I told him it was a little forward, not far off the Road we were in. While I was praying for him and singing a Psalm, he looked frequently over his Shoulder. He delivered some Papers; the Substance of which is given Account of in the preceding Narrative. Only he gave it as his last Confession, that he neither committed nor intended any Felony in Mr. Brewer's House the second of August last; but that waiting for one, with whom he had an Appointment till twelve at Night; he then went to the little House, and being much in Liquor, he fell asleep, when he awoke, not knowing how to get out, he broke into the House, by that Means to make his Way into the Street; then hearing a Noise in the House, he jumped into a neighbouring Back-yard, and hid himself under a little Shed, where he was taken. He reflected upon the Prosecutor, and complained much upon the barbarous Usage they gave him, when he was apprehended. He addressed himself to the People, and desired all young Persons to take Example from him, and to live regularly in the Fear of God, and in Obedience and due Submission to</p>

            <p>Dr. R. NELSON, being well known to have made the Cure of SEMINAL and GENITAL Imbecilities his chief Study and Practice for above 30 Years, does recommend his most Noble Cleansing and Strengthning Elixir, which Thousands of People (many of them of high Rank) have happily experienced, and is by Numbers of Physicians and Surgeons approv'd, as the only BALSAMICK HEALING and RESTORING Medicine to be depended upon, in the World,</p>
            <p>For GLEETS and WEAKNESSES,</p>
            <p>The Bane of Virility or Manhood, in the one Sex, and Destroyer of Fertility or the Bearing of Children in the other, whether from ill cur'd Venereal Infections (than which nothing is more common) or from inordinate Coltion, or Self-Pollution (that cursed School Wickedness, which spoils all our Youth, by nipping their Man hood in the Bud) or from involuntary Emissions a nights in the Sleep, or in the Day time, upon Stool, or with the Urine; or from Falls, Blows, Strains, Wrenches, or the like, which drain and dry up the Seminals, and wither, as it were, the Generative Faculties, causing Impotency in Men, the Fluor Albus, or Barrenness in Women (or but a weakly, sickly Offspring if any); and in the long Run (by impoverishing the Blood and Spirits) Melancholly, Vapours, Decays of Nature and Consumptions.</p>
            <p>No Medicine can be more pleasant to take, nor any Thing upon Earth more effectual for the Purpose; for let the Imbecility be ever so great, or of ever so long standing, and be either in the Parts, Spermatick Vessels, or Back, with Pain or without, it certainly Cures, by reviving and enriching the Blood and Spirits, comforting, nourishing, and replenishing the Reins and Seminals, and strengthening, and restoring the Genital Parts in both Sexes, how much soever weakned, rendered cold, or deadned, and bringing them to their natural Force, Warmth, and Vigour, by thickening and fertilizing the Seed, which before was thin, waterish, or yellowish, and consequently insufficient, either for Procreation or the Act of it.</p>
            <p>All Disorders of the Urine, as Difficulty in the making or retaining it, or its dribbling away hot orsmarting, or foul, slimy, thready, greasy, or stinking, whether from Gravel, Stone, Strangury or a Venereal Cause, are likewise speedily cured by it, and the Water made to be held as strongly, and yet brought away as freely, easily, full stream'd, and clear as ever.</p>
            <p>These are the real Vertues of this great Medicine, which could all who stand in need of it, (but have not yet tried it) be made as sensible of, as those Numbers of People are, who have tried it, they would gladly, and quickly too, have recourse to it.</p>
            <p>Price 5 s. a Bottle. Prepared by the abovesaid Author and sold only (sealed up with Directions how to take it and how to discover whether the Gleet or Weakness be Venereal or not) at Mr. ISTED's, a Bookseller, at the Golden Ball, between St. Dunstan's Church and Chancery-Lane End in Fleet-Street, asking only for a 5 s, Bottle of Elixir.</p>
