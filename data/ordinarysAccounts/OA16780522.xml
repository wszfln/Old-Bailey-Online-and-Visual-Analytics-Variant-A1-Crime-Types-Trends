            <p>The Confession and Execution of the Prisoners suffering at <placeName id="OA16780522-geo-4">Tyburn</placeName>.</p>
            <p>OF these unhappy wretches who now became necessary Sacrifices Justice, he that occasioned most discourse, as well by reason of his being generally known, as by the heinousness of his Crime, being the death of a very worthy Gentleman, was a person that being heretofore in a very good place, might have liv'd as comfortably and genteely as any man of his Rank could have wisht; but extravagance still wanting Supplies, put him upon wicked designes, lost his Employ, and since which, having followed loose irregular courses, he at last came to commit this bloody Crime for which he was now executed: the Particulars whereof having been already published, need not here be repeated. When he came to receive Sentence of Death, he desired time to prepare himself; to which the Court answered, that he should have what was usual and convenient, but caution'd him not to mook God, or flatter himself with vain hopes of a Reprieve, as many do under that pretence; but rather with all his might to humble himself and make his peace with God. Several Ministers visited him after his Condemnation, and earnestly press'd him to a hearty Repentance, and that if any others were Confederates with. or A betters of him in this barbarous Murder, he would disburthen his Soul by discovering them: But he was at first so far from answering their expectations therein, that he would give no full account of the Reasons or Provocations that moved him to do it; nor would he for some time declare himself guilty of the Murder, but at last he did confess it, saying, It was upon an Affront that he could not bear; but expressed himself heartily sorry for his cruel Rage, and desired all that were present, to pray for him to Almighty God, that he might</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA167805220003"/>
            <p>obtain Pardon for that and all other his manifold sins.</p>
            <p>After his Condemnation the generous Charity of the Keeper of <placeName id="OA16780522-geo-5">Newgate</placeName> favoured him so far as to permit him to lie in the <placeName id="OA16780522-geo-6">Press-yard</placeName>, though he had not Money to defray the usual Fees of that Lodging; where he was at last so far wrought upon, that never any man appeared more sensibly penitent: an Instance or two whereof (amongst many others) we think fit here to recite. The day before his Execution he askt what it was a Clock, and being told past eleven, Ah, Lord, says he, where shall I be to morrow at this time? The same day a Barber coming to trim him, after he had washt his hands very clean, looking upon them, he said, Cleanse, O God, my hands from Blood guiltiness, and all my sins as clean as they now appear from filth. Then taking a turn or two in the Chamber, God grant, says he, I may fear Death to morrow no more than I do to day: for I bless God I have now no dread upon my Spirits concerning the Death I am to suffer. I know 'its just, and therefore will willingly undergo it; not doubting but the pretious Blood of my Saviour has attoned for that Innocent Blood which I have rashly and wickedly shed. And so continued in an undaunted temper and frame of Spirit to the very last.</p>
            <p>The whole night before he suffered, he spent in Devotion, continuing in Prayer with such ardency of zeal, and such apt Expressions of a broken heart, and yet humble Faith and Assurance in the Mercies of God, as the like was searce ever heard in that place before, And so about ten a clock, was carried to the place of Execution, in <placeName id="OA16780522-geo-7">Covent Garden</placeName>, where he made a large Confession of his sins, and recommending his Soul to God in a most zealous Prayer, submitted to the Sentence.</p>

Another young Woman was Condemned with her, but being supposed to be drawn in by her, obtained a Gracious Pardon: As likewise did another Woman and a young Man, who severally had robb'd their Masters.</p>
            <p>These last mentioned Persons having spent most part of their Lives in a continual series of Wickedness, and Rebellion against God and all righteous Laws, it is no wonder if now, when they were overtaken by Justice, and had he amazing terrours of Death to grapple with, they were smitten with dreadful Horrours and Astonishment; from which both Mr. Ordinary and</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA167805220005"/>
            <p>other Godly Ministers endeavoured to awake and relieve them, first by representing to them the miserable Condition they werein; that the Temporal Death, which must they fixt their thoughts upon, was nothing in comparison of what was to succeed: And afterwards acquainted them, that there was yet a Way, and but only one, to prevent their everlasting Misery; which was a speedy and serious Repentance, and laying hold on the Merits of their crucified Saviour, by a firm and lively Faith: By whose gracious Promises, and consideration of his Infinite Mercies, they sought to take them off both from Atheistical Insensibility on the one hand, and Despair on the other, and so set them in the path of Lie, before they tasted of the bitter Cup of Death; and 'tis hoped, by the Grace and Blessing of God on their Labours, their pious Intentions towards these poor Souls were not in vain. For in their passage, and at the place of Execution, they behaved themselves with all the marks of a sincere Penitency, bewailing their former mispent time, and horrid Impieties, imploring Mercy at the Throne of Grace, and desiring all Spectators, by amendment of Life, to make a better use of their sad Examples, than they themselves had done of other suffering in the like ignominious manner.</p>
