            <p>While he was under Condemnation, before he made his Escape, he had the same Instructions in common with the Rest of his Fellow-Prisoners, and seemed very devout and serious, and received the Blessed Sacrament with Afflack, Lowden, and the other Malefactors, who were afterwards Executed; and since his being retaken, he has behav'd in a becoming devout and serious Manner.</p>
            <p>As he seemed to be a Man of some Capacity, I took Occasion the stronger to represent to him how much inconsistent, as well as directly contrary to the express Commands of Almighty God, and the Human Laws of Man, it was, to invade our Neighbour's Property; Thou shalt not steal, says the 8th Commandment, nor shalt thou covet thy Neighbour's Goods, says the 10th; he who covets only, is guilty of a Breach of this last Commandment, but he who actually steals, is much more guilty, and must surely expect a future Punishment, adequate to his Guilt, unless by a sincere and penitential humbling himself before an offended God, and emploring Mercy and Forgiveness for his Sins and Wickedness, he should obtain Pardon; Seek ye the Lord (says the Prophet Isaiah) while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; let the Wicked forsake his Way, and the unrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly Pardon. From this, and other such Texts of Scripture, I endeavour'd to exhort him to a sincere and true Repentance, as well as comfort him in Hopes of a future Salvation. I also instructed him in the Nature and End of our Lord's Supper, that he might become a worthy Partaker thereof, and thereby prepare himself for that Change which he must so soon Experience. During the whole Time of his Confinement, both before his Escape, and after, he ever seem'd serious and Devout, tho' his Sincerity might be much doubted, as his Thoughts were continually employed about making his Escape, which he effected in a Manner almost beyond Thought; the falling-down the Gutter almost ten Feet high, was attended with so much Danger, that 'twas next to a Miracle that he had not fallen into the Press-Yard, and dash'd out his Brains.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding all the Intreaties the Man made use of, they were sufficient Proof against them, and rifled the Man of all he had about him, which amounted to no more than two Shillings; and threaten'd to blow his Brains out if he made the least Resistance.</p>
            <p>I begg'd of them to consider the poor Man's Circumstances, but my Request to them had little Effect, and I had then one Shilling and Twopence in my Pocket, which I freely gave the Man, in some Measure to compensate his Loss.</p>

            <p>It came to my Lot to be the first Person who was to put this Project in Execution, and we went staggering along, 'till we met a Higler on Horseback.</p>
            <p>I seem'd a little unwilling to attack a Horseman, but they insisting upon my going up to him, I took hold of the Horse's Bridle and stopp'd him.</p>
            <p>I led him through a Gateway into a Field; it was between One and Two o'Clock, and very dark, so that I should not have been able to distinguish whether the Person was an old or a young Man, if I had seen him five thousand Times.</p>
            <p>Dean and Overton were upon the Watch, while we were about this Man.</p>
            <p>I search'd his Pockets, and Jenkyns stood over him with a Pistol, loaded with tenpenny Nails.</p>
            <p>The Higler begg'd of us not to take his Fowls, upon which Jenkyns swore he would shoot him, and I was afraid he might do it without any Design, and so I took the Pistol from him, and shook out</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174205070014"/>
            <p>the Priming, and return'd it to him again.</p>
            <p>The Man still continued interceeding for his Fowls, upon which Jenkyns gave him a Blow on the Shoulders, and then I took the Pistol from him entirely, because he should not hurt him. I then search'd his Pockets, and took from him a Shilling, a Halfpenny, and a Farthing, and likewise a brass Porto-Bello Medal.</p>
            <p>Then we cut the Hampers down, and took out two and twenty Fowls, and put them into a Sack that covered the Hamper. Upon searching the Hampers further, we found a small Pair of Wallets among the Straw. The Higler told us we stopped him at a wrong Time, for he had got no Money; but if we would let him go to Market and sell his Fowls, we might have his Money as he came back. Jenkins then swore he would knock him on the Head if he did not tell where the Money was; upon which the old Man being frighted, told us there were forty Shillings in the Wallets abovementioned; so I put them into the Bag with the Fowls, and we all came away together.</p>
            <p>When we came Home, I took the Bag from Jenkins, to whom I had delivered it to carry, and turned all the Fowls out upon the Floor, and we lik'd them very well, being all ready pick'd to our Hands; but when we came to look in the Wallet for the forty Shillings, we were extreamly surprized and disappointed, to find nothing in them but a Piece of brown Bread, and a Piece of Cheese.</p>
            <p>We then shared the Money we had taken that Night; and after we had looked out four of the Fowls for our own Eating, we computed that the Remainder would fetch a Shilling a-piece one with another, and they were accordingly sold by Jenkin's Wife and Overton, who were used to that Business; and the Money was shared equally among us.</p>
            <p>When I came to be perfectly sober, after this Enterprize, I reflected upon what I had been doing, and should have been glad, could I have recalled it; but being afraid to stay in Town, I bought a Horse for twenty-seven Shillings, and went into the Country to <rs id="OA17420507-occupation-16" type="occupation">sell Fish</rs>

            <p>I had forgot to mention, that one Haines had taken some Money from me, and while I was out of Town, he heard of my being concerned in robbing the Higler, and came to my Wife, and told her, if I would come to him, I might have my Money again; he thinking by that Means to decoy me to his House, and secure me.

            <p>He took me to his House, where I confessed every Thing, in Hopes of being admitted an Evidence against my Companions; but notwithstanding he promised that I should receive Favour, Dean, by the Intercession of his Friends, was accepted of, and I committed in order to take my Trial, and was at the ensuing Sessions capitally convicted.</p>
            <p>After I had received Sentence of Death, having lost all Hopes of receiving any Mercy in this World, my Thoughts, which ought to have been at that Time otherwise employed, were taken up in meditating my Escape from this Place, and for that Purpose I had, when I was up at Chapel, been looking eight or nine Days for a Place to get out at.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, on the 25th of March, about Eight o'Clock, the Cells being unlocked in order to serve the Prisoners with Bread and other Necessaries, I asked Leave to go to the Vault, which was readily granted.</p>
            <p>I then observed the Keeper go up Stairs, to serve the People in the middle Teir, and thought that a proper Opportunity to put my Design in Execution: I therefore, instead of returning to my Cell again (as the Keeper I suppose expected I would) slipped out of the Passage, and ran up Stairs into the Chapel.</p>
            <p>Having got thus far, I pulled out a Rail of the Table in the Chapel, with which I wrenched a Bar out of the Window, and then jumped down the Height of about Nine Feet into the Gutter, which is about a Foot wide, so that if I had slipped an Inch aside, I must inevitably have fallen into the Press-Yard, and been dashed to Pieces, but I fell long Ways in the Gutter without the least Hurt.</p>
            <p>After this I got up by the Side of the Roof, and ran along the Tops of the Houses, till I came to a Pair of Leads, where there was a Door which opened into a House. I went in there, and first through a Room full of Goods, and then into another, where there was a Man a-bed: I being apprehensive he might take Notice of me, thought it the most prudent Method to go back again.</p>
            <p>Accordingly I ran farther along, till I came to a House where I saw the Carpenters had been putting new Muntings in. This induced me to believe it was an empty House; so I got down thro' there, and from thence went into <placeName id="OA17420507-geo-49">

            <p>This certainly cut me to the Heart, to see myself slighted and neglected by one, who ought, by all the Ties both human and divine, to have consulted my Happiness and Interest.</p>
            <p>Being in this Scituation, and deprived of all the Comfort I expected in seeing my Family here, I was at a Loss what to do; at last I was determined to go into the Country again, and acquainted a Man, whom I took to be my Friend, with my Design.</p>
            <p>He seemed to express the utmost Uneasiness for me, least I should be retaken, and promised (with an Appearance of Fairness) if I would go into the Country, he would see me 20 or 30 Miles on the Way.</p>
            <p>I had just heard that there were People in Pursuit of me, and who were drinking at a Public House; I therefore gave him Three Half-pence, to go and join their Company, and observe their Motions. He accordingly went, and I, in the mean Time, laid myself down under a Hayrick, and went to sleep.</p>
            <p>When I wak'd, I observed some People coming towards me, and among them my Friend. This gave me some Reason to suspect he had betrayed his Trust. Upon which, the only Course I had now left, was to endeavour to run, and so get out of the Hands of my Pursuers.</p>
            <p>I ran about a Mile, from <placeName id="OA17420507-geo-62">

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174205070017"/>
            <p>Gentlewoman of the House gave me Leave to come in.</p>
            <p>I ran up Stairs immediately into a Room, upon which the Maid locked me in, and threw the Key of the Door out at the Window to my Pursuers.</p>
            <p>Upon that Account not thinking myself safe here, I got out of the Window, and ran about the Tiles, where they could not follow me; and then I got in at another Window, in another Part of the Roof.</p>
            <p>The House being beset, I had little Hopes of getting off till they were gone. Upon which I laid myself between the Bed and the Sacking, where I continued half an Hour before they could find me, they having searched all the House over without Effect. But at last I was taken, and again conveyed to <placeName id="OA17420507-geo-64">

            <p>Under these miserable Circumstances in which I am involved, the great and only Consolation to me is, that the Hardships I endure here, will have a Period, and that though unfortunate in this Life, I have Reason to hope for Happiness in another.</p>
            <p>The only Thing which aggravates my Misfortunes, and cuts me to the Soul every Time I think of it, is, that I must leave my two Children to the Care of a Wife, who has, by her Treatment of me, shewn the little Regard she bears to them.</p>
            <p>I heartily forgive her for not visiting me here; I should be glad to impute it to any thing else but her Neglect and Indifference.</p>
            <p>For my own Part, I desire not to live, as Ingratitude, and all its attendant Vices, has taken its Residence among my dearest Friends; but - my Children! - were it not for them, if I could be let out at the Gate this Moment, I would turn in again, and readily suffer the Death appointed for me by the Law; but they are my Care and Concern, tho' I fear now they will be inevitably ruin'd.</p>
            <p>I have a long Time been designing (and had Life permitted, could have brought it to Perfection) a Ship which would sail on the Land, in the same Manner as a common Sloop on the Water, and carry any Weight.</p>
            <p>It must be done by Strength of the Air, drawing through Flews, that shall draw, the same as a Smoak-Jack in a Chimney.</p>
            <p>It must go upon three Wheels, one Wheel before, and guided like the Stern of a Ship, and may be worked by one Man.</p>
