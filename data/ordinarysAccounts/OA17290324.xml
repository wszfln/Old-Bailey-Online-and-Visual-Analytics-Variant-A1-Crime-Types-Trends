                  <interp inst="OA17290324n4-15" type="given" value="ELEANOR"/>Eleanor Oldfield</persName>, were Capitally Convicted, and receiv'd Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>While under Sentence they were instructed, how that it was necessary for them to reform and amend the Evil of their Ways and Doings; for that all Men being by nature Enemies to God, and consequently. Obnoxious to the Divine Wrath and Vengeance; and they having committed Sins of a more heinous Nature, as the Scripture expressethit; they having corrupted themselves, their spot not having been the Spot of God's Children; and they having been a perverse Generation. Therefore, they were liable to a double degree of Punishment. Then I shew'd them that the only way to escape this terrible and severe Judgment of God, was, to apply themselves with the utmost Vigour and Sincerity, to the great Work of their Souls Salvation, while any short space of Time remain'd, since their Work they had to do, was of the highest Importance, their time very short, and their strength but small, nothing less depending upon the improvement of a few remaining Moments; than the eternal Salvation or Damnation of their Souls, &amp;c. I insisted on the horrid Sin of Murder, from the Prophet Nathan's Application of his Parable to King David, 2. Sam. 7 12. Thou art the Man. I let him see the atrocious Nature of this Sin, how that it was a Breach of the express Law of God, Thou shalt not Kill, or as it is otherwise express'd, Thou shalt do no Murder: I shew'd him the Injustice, the Cruelty, the Inhumanity, the Barbarity of this most atrocious Crime, and that however, secretly Murder might be Committed, yet the vengeance of God always pursu'd the Murderer, so that seldom, if ever, he escap'd exemplary Punishment in this World: Accordingly the first precept God gave to Noah after the Flood was, not to suffer the Murderer to pass unpunished, Gen. 5. 6. Who so sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed; For in the Image of God made he Man. I took occasion to shew that Murdering and taking away the Life of our Neighbour unjustly, was encroaching upon the Divine right of Almighty God, who is the only Sovereign Lord of the Life and Death of his Creatures, Deut. 32. 39. I kill, and I make alive. I reflected upon the hellish Cruelty of such a Sin, as endeavouring, what in him lies at once, to destroy both the Soul and Body forever; if the mercy of God in Jesus Christ prevent it not. I told him how that this Sin, in an especial manner, must certainly excite Hell upon Earth in the Breast of the Sinner, his own conscience like a Legion of Devils, still Racking and Tormenting him, and presenting to his Eyes the Image of the Murder'd Person, so that his Life becomes a Burthen to himself, and like Cain the first Murtherer, Gen 4. 13. His Punishment is greater than he can bear. I exhorted them all to an ingenuous Confession of their Sins, and to that purpose I used many, most pressing Motives and Arguments. I inform'd them how that they were early Dedicated to God in their Baptism, to deny themselves to the World, the Flesh and the Devil, and to Dedicate their Souls and Bodies unto God; and how notoriously they had broken their Baptismal Vows and Engagements, and that therefore they ought now to renew themselves by Repentance, and in token of their sincere Repentance, to receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as a sure Pledge and Symbol of that everlasting Communion and Fellowship, which blessed Spirits shall have with God in the other World.</p>

As to the Fact for which he died, he said, that he did not steal the two Horses, but that he own'd that he gave the Key of the Stable to another Person, who had gone off with the Horses, by the Persuasion of two Men. I told him, that he had no Body to blame but himself for his Misfortune, if it was so, but this Account of the Matter seeming improbable, I exhorted him to make a free Confession, and to glorify God by so doing. He would not acknowledge any more, but as I daily visited him in the Cell, (for he was so afflicted with Sickness and Lameness, that he never came to Chapel) he appear'd very Devout, and was very attentive to Prayers and Exhortations. He died Penitent in appearance, believ'd to be sav'd only through the Merits of Jesus Christ, freely forgiving all Injuries done him, as he expected Forgiveness from Almighty God.</p>

He committed a great many other Robberies, and said, that he could tell me of forty of fifty, but knowing that no Body could remember them, he would not trouble the World with any farther Account of that kind. He commended his late Wife for a Virtuous good Woman, as also the young Woman whom he lately Married, and who is still living, and said, that she knew nothing of his wicked courses, and desir'd that no Body might be so unjust, as to impute his crimes to her. He also said, that lew'd Women were his ruin. He own'd, that his Parents (particularly his Mother) were very indulgent to him, but that he never took her advice, which might have prevented his misfortune. He said, that he believ'd he had been Drunk seven times, for he had no pleasure in Drinking, but he was very much addicted to Whoring, Coveteousness, and Idleness; not much to Swearing. He commonly appear'd with too great an Air of indifference, while under Sentence. He declar'd that he believ'd to be Sav'd by the Mercy of God through Christ, that he was sincerely Penitent for his whole most Sinful and wicked Life, and that he died in Peace with all Mankind.</p>

He said, that the occasion of his going to rob on the Highway, was, his meeting with bad Company, particularly of lewd Women, with whom he spent all his Money, which being gone, he thought the easiest way to get himself Recruited was, to take a Purse from Gentlemen or others, whom he met on the Highway, who were better provided than he, when it cost him little or no pains, or labour; although by that means he lost what was much more Valuable, his Character and a good Conscience, besides the certain loss of Life, whenever he could be Discover'd and Apprehended. He said also, that he never was a pilfering Thief, and that he was but fourteen Days before he was taken up, employ'd in that wicked and unlawful Practice of Highway Robberies, and that he only committed five Robberies, two or three of them in Company with Marple, who had been his old School Fellow and intimate Acquaintance, when both of them were Young.
