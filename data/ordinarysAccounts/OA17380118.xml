While under Sentence he never came to Chapel above three or four Times, and that was after the Report was made to his Majesty in Council: I often advised him to attend the publick Worship of God, but he made trifling Excuses; and when I visited him, he was always either taken up with Company; or busy among a Heap of Papers. He was once employed as an Attorney in the Affairs of a Bankrupt, but the Money assigned for paying the Creditors was carried off, and they never got any Thing; they alledged that Car went off with 120 l. of which he never would give any Account. A Baker, who had lost considerably in that Affair, coming to visit him upon a Sunday, he sent up his Name, but Mr. Car returned Answer, that he did not desire to see the Man, and that he was taken up with Company.</p>
            <p>Quarrington, besides his other oversights in this Affair, was guilty of the greatest Folly, first in exposing his Money above Stairs, to the Drawer and the common Woman, and afterwards in the Kitchen Mr. Carr upon his Trial made but a weak Defence, but Quarrington gave a distinct Account of the Fact without any Variation.</p>
            <p>He was civil and courteous in his Deportment, but far from being duly affected with his deplorable Circumstances, and was not willing to own every Thing as sworn against him. He professed a sincere Faith in Christ, thro' whose Merits he hop'd for Salvation; he repented of all the many and great Sins of his Life, and forgave all Men, as he expected Forgiveness from God.</p>

            <p>ABOUT 10 o'Clock they were brought out of Newgate, and convey'd to Tyburn in four Carts, viz.

Mr. Car was dressed in a Black Suit, and she in White. When they came to the Place of Execution, they were all put into one Cart, but Mr. Car was some time before his Coach could come up, as soon as he enter'd the Cart, he immediately made his Obeisance to his Fellow Sufferers, and particularly addressed himself to Mrs. Adams; as soon as she saw him in the Cart, she burst out into Tears. Then he looking round upon the Spectators with great Calmness and Serenity of Mind; call'd out to a Gentleman at a little Distance from him in a Coach, to deliver him his Packet of Papers, which was accordingly deliver'd to him seal'd up.</p>
            <p>He soon again deliver'd them into one Mr. Rawlinson's Hands, earnestly requesting they might be sent to Mr. Applebee and made Publick.</p>
            <p>He then join'd in Prayer with the rest of his Fellow Sufferers, and behav'd throughout the Service in a very devout Manner.</p>
            <p>Mr. Car and likewise Mrs. Adams spoke something to the Spectators relating to the Robbery for which they died, then he turning his Eyes upwards towards Heaven, submitted himself to God as the only Searcher of Hearts, and before whom (he said) he was to appear in 5 Minutes.</p>
            <p>Just before the Cart drew away, Mr. Car and Mrs. Adams embraced each other, and held one another by the Hand, till after they were cast off.</p>
            <p>All of them appear'd with great Seriousness and Devotion, and were very desirous of Prayers to God for their departing Souls, and had nothing material to add to their former Confessions. The other Criminals own'd their Crimes, and they all beg'd Mercy of God.</p>

            <p>The first, and indeed the principal Cause of his Misfortunes, was a strong Inclination to a voluptuous Life; if he would have been contented with a moderate Subsistence, his Business would very well have afforded it, without his having Recourse to irregular Practices; but having taken it into his Head to live like a Man of Pleasure, he was forced to strike out of the ordinary Road of Business, to accomplish his End. His first Deviations from Honesty, were in the Business of the Parish; these were not found out immediately, and when they were discovered, Compassion for him, and Respect to his Relations, preserved him in that Employment, till his Conduct, which grew worse and worse, was at last so bad, that he was removed from his Office; whereupon he broke up House-Keeping, and took Chambers in the <placeName id="OA17380118-geo-64">

By Degrees he became acquainted with a certain Knot of People who were concerned in procuring Evidence on particular Causes, when, and wherever such Assistance was necessary; to which detestable Practice, if Mr. Baron Thompson, and other worthy Magistrates, had not opposed themselves, it must by this Time have swell'd to an enormous Height; as it was, Mr. Car had a great Share in the Success which for some Time that Practice met with, and though he took Care not to appear so publickly in it as others did, yet his Precaution did not prevent many Imputations on his Character, and so he was compell'd to keep mostly that Company, which as it brought him into the Path of, so it hurry'd him on to Destruction.</p>
            <p>He was a Person in himself capable enough of Business, if he had sufficiently attended to it, but Horse-Races, Gaming-Houses, Play-Houses, and Tavern Kitchens, were Places in which he could make but small Improvement, except in low Wit and Buffoonry, to which he addicted himself till he became contemptible to all, who were not Objects of Contempt themselves. His Business by this Means came to lie chiefly in trifling with just Suits, negotiating with Bailiffs, to deceive those who employ'd them, and in finding Means to screen fraudulent Dealers behind the Letter of the Law.</p>
            <p>In the last Year of his Life he became very intimate at the House where the base Scene happened which brought him to his dismal End; it had been long (to the Scandal of the Neighbourhood) infamous for such Practices, some Instances having before appeared at the Old-Bailey, so that nothing could excuse a Man's having any Thing to do there, who would not either pass for a Fool or a Knave. Mr. Car always insisted that his Business led him thither, and what Sort of Business his was, the Reader has heard; 'twas to defend Mrs. Prevost, who was then under Prosecution for</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173801180011"/>
            <p>keeping that disorderly House. The Prosecutor, <persName id="OA17380118n76-1">

            <p>Mr. Car, in his Defence, call'd Witnesses to prove, that he was in his Chambers in the <placeName id="OA17380118-geo-67">
                  <interp inst="OA17380118-geo-67" type="type" value="site"/>

After he received Sentence, he asked some Favours from the Court, on Account of his bad State of Health, which were granted him, and he was treated with the utmost Indulgence during the many Weeks of his Imprisonment.</p>
            <p>His Conduct in this Space of Time, was far from commendable. He saw a great deal of Company, entered with them into all Sorts of general Discourse, and appear'd to be less concern'd for himself than others were for him. He always owned his Belief that Mr. Quarrington was robbed of the Money, tho' he persisted in it, that he knew nothing of the Matter, but was gone long before, and would fain have had it pass for a Proof of the Truth of what he said, that he had acquainted the Prosecutor how to come at Adams. She had, it seems, instructed him with the Knowledge of the Place to which she retired, and so enabled him to bring her to share in his Punishment, as she had shar'd in his Crimes. He insisted likewise on his having never absconded, and seem'd only desirous to vindicate himself, tho' in all other Respects he allow'd that the Evidence of the Prosecutor might be true.</p>
            <p>After the Dead Warrant came down, when most Criminals are wont to quit their false Hopes, and come to Reason, he retained his former Conduct, and tho' he shew'd some Apprehension of his approaching End, yet except taking Care for an Undertaker, he made little Preparation for it: He yet entertain'd Thoughts of receiving Mercy, insisting still on his Innocence, and desiring those to whom he spoke, to vindicate him after he should be dead.</p>
            <p>It may without Breach of Charity be said, that his Want of Concern could not be deriv'd from Innocence, or from a rational Contempt of Death, because setting aside the Crime for which he died, it was notorious that he had done many wrong Things, which ought to have induced him to a serious and particular Repentance.

This Money he embezzled, and became thereby not only Guilty of a Breach of Trust, but also of distroying the Charity; a Thing so base and dishonourable in its Nature, that it needs no Aggravation. Detaining Debts he was imploy'd to recover, and deceiving those whom he undertook to defend, were Methods he too often practised to supply his Extravagance, and therefore, as he had injured many, and was able to make Restitution to none, he had too just Cause to have been seriously concerned for his mispent Life, and to have taken his Sufferings patiently.</p>
            <p>What has been said, is not intended to blacken his Memory, or to deprive him of the Pity which naturally arises in every Man's Mind, on those who fall Victims to Justice and the Law. The Design of these Accounts is to benefit the Living, the Dead can receive neither Good nor Hurt from them. It is to be hoped, that such as have only enter'd on the Paths which brought this unhappy Man to his Ruin, will see by his Example, what themselves must come to, if they do not bethink themselves in Time. Without question, the inordinate Love of Pleasure, the Contempt not only of Religion, but of Decency, the shameless Debauchery of Night-Houses, and the open Practice of Gaming, so notorious in this present Age, have a strong Tendency to mislead Men to their Ruin: And therefore, the Sacrifices made by the Law, ought to be well explain'd, as the best and almost the only Means to deter others from the like Practices. Reputation is quickly lost, hardly ever to be recovered; and when it is lost, People are apt to run Headlong into the most dangerous Practices, in order to procure Supplies for their Necessities and Pleasures, not apprehending how high a Price they may one Day pay for their past Follies and ill Conduct.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Allen.</p>
            <p>THO' I am an entire Stranger to your Person, yet being acquainted with your unhappy Circumstances by an intimate Acquaintance of yours, and by reading your Trial in the Sessions Book, I thought it not amiss, by a few Lines, to endeavour to assist you in your Preparation for that awful Doom; which by the just Laws of the Land have been sentenc'd to receive for the heinous Crime you have been guilty of. And in the first Place, I would earnestly beg of you to employ the few remaining Moments of your Life, as much as possible, in serious and close Reflection. Remember that Death in any Shape must needs be terrible to a Sinner, even tho' his Life has not been stain'd with notorious Crimes; in as much as it brings him before the Bar of God, where he must receive an irrevocable Sentence, according to the Demerit of his Iniquity, and must be happy or miserable even to all Eternity. But to go out of the World under the Guilt of Murder, and that attended with such shocking and terrible Aggravations, must needs render Death still more awful and tremendous, and the Account you must give to him the great Judge, must be a dreadful one. Murder is a Crime which God has solemnly declared his Displeasure against, and which, without sincere and hearty Repentance, he will punish with everlasting Damnation. Your great Business then is to see to it, that you truly and unfeignedly repent of this your heinous Sin. And that you may not be mistaken in a Matter of such great Importance, the following Things must be carefully attended to. That your Sorrow and Contrition for this Evil be greater, from the Consideration of its being an Offence against God, and contrary to his righteous Laws and just Government, than from the shameful Consequences and ignominious Death which it exposes you to. Revolve the Goodness of God, and the reasonableness and rectitude of his Laws in your Mind, till you find your Heart melted and broken with ingenuous Sorrow, and you are brought to the Confession of David, - against thee, thee only have I sinned, and done this Evil in thy Sight. And consider that the Sincerity of your Repentance is so important a Thing, that nothing less than the eternal Welfare of your Soul is concern'd. But to avoid Mistakes in so material a Point, - consider also, that your Repentance, however ingenuous and sincere, however deep and hearty it may be, will not be the procuring Cause of your Acceptance with God, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity. Your Acceptance with God is owing to the Merits of Christ alone; therefore in order to your Repentance being effectual, and to make it evidential of your Reconciliation with God, - you must believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and commit your Soul into his Hands, as the only Saviour and Redeemer of Sinners. You must look for and expect Salvation only by his Righteousness, for the Scriptures declare, that out of Christ - God is a consuming Fire. And whereas you can neither believe nor repent but as you are assisted by the Holy Spirit, so let me beg of you to spend much of your Time in sincere devout and earnest Prayer to God for the Assistance of his Spirit, that he would grant you Repentance unto Life, and Remission of your Sins; that your Repentance may be hearty and sincere never to be repented of; that he would assist you in this your difficult Work; that tho' your Crime be of the deepest Dye, yet beg Mercy of God, whose Mercies are infinite. The Scriptures say, that all manner of Sin and Wickedness shall be forgiven upon sincere Repentance, and that the Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all Sin; therefore tho' your Crime is great, and justly calls for the bitterest and deepest Sorrow, yet let it not drive you to Despair, for there is Hope, that even you, - guilty as you are, may (thro' the infinite Mercy of God in Christ) be forgiven, on your sincere Repentance. The Thief on the Cross, and even some of the Murderers of our blessed Lord, found Favour at his merciful Hands, and if such Offenders, even as these found Grace in his Sight, there is Hope for you.</p>
            <p>Let me exhort you to banish as much as may be, every Thing that may hinder your Preparation for Eternity. Remember that your everlasting Happiness depends on the due Improvement of the few Minutes you have to live, and if this Work is not effectually done now, you will be</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173801180013"/>
            <p>eternally miserable. And O! who can bear to think of everlasting Torments without trembling? Who can dwell with everlasting Burnings? Who can inhabit eternal Flames? Let such Meditations as these be frequently in your Minds. O my Soul! The dreadful Hour approaches, when I must bid Adieu to the Vanities of Life, and by a shameful Death be arrested and hurried to the awful Bar of my righteous and just Judge, my Sovereign offended Creator, and this with the dreadful Guilt of Murder upon me. I destroy'd a poor helpless Infant, that was conceived in Lust, and I am now going to answer my Crimes before the Tribunal of impartial Justice, and I am sensible I deserve to be doom'd to endless Misery. But alas! Is there no Hope for me! Is there no Relief for my guilty Soul! If I look within, my Conscience accuses me, and pronounces me worthy of eternal Damnation; if I look up to God, I can expect nothing but Anger and Resentment - nothing but Judgment and fiery Indignation. O! whither then shall I fly, or where hide my self from Almighty Vengeance! Is there no City of Refuge for a Murderer - no Saviour for such guilty Souls! O! there is Jesus at the Right Hand of God, exalted thither for this End, to give Repentance and Remission of Sins, thither will I fly, in his Wounds will I seek to hide, and with the Blood that flow'd from them will I endeavour to cleanse my guilty Soul. O! Blessed Jesus - O! merciful Saviour! Look down with Compassion on a poor condemn'd Wretch, that despairs of Mercy, if she finds it not with thee. Thou didst - O! thou Saviour of lost Souls, in the Days of thy Flesh, while thou was hanging on the Cross, and in the Agonies of Death - thou didst pray for those that were thy Murderers, and had imbrued their Hands in thy sacred and precious Blood, and didst afterwards command thy Apostles to preach Forgiveness, first of all to those who had been thy Betrayers and Murderers. O then since thy Mercies are so great, let me a guilty Creature partake of them! O! may that Blood which flowed from thy Wounds, procure my Pardon, and purchase my Reconciliation with offended Justice! May thy Death expiate the Guilt I have contracted, that when I launch out of Time into dreadful Eternity, I may find my Judge to be my reconciled Friend, and instead of meeting with that dreadful Punishment, which my Crimes loudly call for, I may be received into thy Presence, with thy Favour, and be made a Partaker, with thy People of the Joys of Heaven.</p>
            <p>And that it may be your happy Lot, is the hearty Desire and Prayer of,</p>
            <p>Your Friend. -</p>
            <p>P. S. I would not by any Means seem to intrude upon the Province of the Reverend Ordinary, whose Work it is to attend you, but compassionating your Circumstances, I thought proper to send this to your Hands, to assist you (in his Absence) in your Preparations for Death and Eternity, since that worthy Gentleman cannot be always with you. I hope neither you nor he, will take this amiss, and if this proves any Way serviceable to you - Give God the Glory, and pray for the Writer.</p>

Had he had Grace to improve the Care taken in his Education, and to have preserved those early Principles of Piety with which in his tender Youth was season'd, he had escap'd the bitterness of his unnatural Death. By his quitting the Path of Virtue and Honesty, has drawn such a Weight of Shame and Misery on himself; let it not be thrown back on his unhappy Parents, but as his Death has satisfied the Law, let it also satisfy the Tongues of Mankind, and prevent their adding to that Load of Sorrow, which without deserving it, those from whom he derives his Birth already bear. How little soever it is in his Power to benefit the Publick, yet with the last Moments of his Breath, he endeavour'd it, by earnestly exciting all young Persons who as yet have indulg'd themselves in unlawful Pleasures, to set his Example before them, and from the Terror of his Death to amend their Lives.</p>
            <p>Mr. Car's Letter to his Mother.</p>
            <p>Madam,</p>
            <p>" IN this distressed Condition in which " I now am, the Sense I have of my " ill Conduct towards you, gives me no " less Pain than the Thoughts of my approaching Death; the Violence and " Shame whereof, as I hope it will expiate my Offences in the Sight of God, " so I trust that this Declaration of my " Sorrow, will make some Attonement " for my Behaviour towards you.</p>
            <p>" It is a Point of Justice due to my " Father's Tenderness and Yours, that I " should acknowledge the Pains taken in " my Education, and that it was entirely " my own Fault, that I fell into those " Paths which have brought me into this " miserable Condition. All I can now " do, is, to own your Goodness towards " me, to regret my despising the Counsels you gave me, and to ascribe my " Fall chiefly to my Folly in this Respect.</p>

            <p>" Comfort your self under your Afflictions, with Remembrance of your " own Care to prevent them, and let not " my Misdeeds which have drawn so " heavy a Judgment on their Author, " affect you, who had no Concern in " them. The World is censorious and " unjust, but not to such a Degree, as " to reflect on a good Mother, for having had a bad Son; on the contrary, " all discreet People will compassionate " you, and contribute to make you easy and happy, which that you may be " here, and in the World to come, is " the last Wish of,</p>

You may soon know that, said the Woman, by enquiring at the House where she lodges; accordingly her Husband went to the House, and asked if there was not a young Woman lodged there above Stairs, yes, says the Gentlewoman of the House, and you may speak with her if you please Sir; she lodges up one pair of Stairs. He went up and knock'd at her Door, upon her opening of it, to his great Astonishment, he found his Wife big with Child, and to her great Surprize, she saw her Husband. When they had recover'd themselves from their Surprize, she fell on her Knees, crying, and begging Forgiveness for her past Faults, and promising him at the same Time never to be guilty of any ill Thing for the Time to come, if he wou'd be so good to forgive her, and that she would make him the best of Wives Well, says he my Dear, you had no Reason to leave me; but if you will behave as an honest Woman ought to do to her Husband, and act a Mother's Part by your two Infants, who can no ways have offended you, I'll look over all your past Faults, and I will take care of the Child which I see you are big with, in the same Manner as if it was my own. In about a Week's Time he paid for her Lodgings, and took a House in Houndsditch, and furnished it, in order to settle in London, and designed</p>
