They took him out into their own Boat, and he immediately owned what he had done; and said he desired to die for it, and when brought before the Justice, he confess'd the Fact. His Behaviour has been serious and quiet since convicted; and he always attended Divine Service, but when hindered by Illness. He said he freely gave up his wicked Life, and had no Hopes but in Jesus's Merits. And indeed, he shewed a good deal of Resignment; for though he had been instrumental in helping others to escape formerly, yet being invited to a Thing of that kind by Broughton and Hayes, immediately after their Conviction, he refus'd to be concerned, and the Design was baffled for that Time. He acknowledged himself to have been a vile Wretch in his Life Time, but behaved all the Time of his being under Conviction, and to the last, with very serious Deportment; and to all Appearance being very penitent, desired rather to die than live in this World.</p>

She told a long Story about it, but not worth relating; so we shall pass that over in Silence, and come to what happened after, which is more immediately relative to her.</p>
            <p>She was left in no great Circumstances, we may imagine, though with but only one Child. This being very young, she put it out to Nurse, and went out herself a <rs id="OA17520323-occupation-25" type="occupation">nurse-keeping</rs>

After she left this Place, she went to her former Lodgings, and took her Child home. The Money she got as before, wasted some how or other, and</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175203230008"/>
            <p>she owns she was not very frugal of it. Then she began to think of putting the Child upon the Parish, and accordingly made Application to the Church-Wardens, but was refused, being told that a Woman of her Years and Strength was obliged by Law to maintain at least one Child, and that if they took the Child, she must deliver up her Goods, and she had better keep them, and strive what she could do to maintain it herself. This however she did not approve of, but was obliged to comply, and the Wickedness of her Disposition was such, that from that Time she determined to destroy her own poor Babe. In pursuance of this barbarous Resolution, she first gave it a strong Dose of Physick, but that had not the intended Effect. She next exposed it upon a Table, under a Window, which she left open, when it rained very hard, thinking that would dispatch it, being but a tender Infant about four or five Months old. But even that Project did not succeed; and she was afterwards so barbarous, as with her own Hands to strangle it in Bed, by stopping its Breath at its Nose, Mouth, and Ears. The Searchers of the Parish came to look into the Cause of the Child's Death, in order to its Burial; and ignorantly declaring it died of Convulsions, as she had told them, the Child was buried forthwith. For a Fortnight after, she says she had not the least Remorse of Conscience; but her own Reflection recoiling upon her then, she was almost driven mad at the Sense of it, and then would have destroyed herself. She says, she once threw herself into the <placeName id="OA17520323-geo-48">

She then was persuaded, upon Reflection, not to lay violent Hands on herself, but however resolved to do something for which she might be cut off by the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>After some Time, being left alone with the poor Child (for murdering whom she was convicted upon pleading guilty) she resolved upon its Death She asked the Child, as it lay in Bed, if it was willing to die; and upon its saying no, Walsam replied, but you shall. And accordingly tied a List about the Child's Neck, with which she strangled it.</p>
            <p>She says, however, that the Child had a Necklace on, which might help to do it's Business the sooner; but this she did not make use of in mitigation of the Crime, which she owned in all its aggravated Circumstances, and that she very deservedly met with her Fate; and worse would be no more than her due.</p>
            <p>She was taken very ill after Conviction, and behaved very much like one that was mad. She had Intervals; sometimes was in great hurry of Spirits, and at others very calm. She had Reason indeed sufficient to be disquieted in Mind, from a Reflection of what she had done. Whether the Perplexities, which arose in her Breast, proceeded from Madness, or Reflection I won't pretend to determine, but I've Reason to think, 'twas sometimes one, and sometimes the other. In the Morning before she went to Execution, she was very calm, and sedate; but, before she dyed, appeared like one perfectly distracted.</p>

Besides, another Person, who wanted to see and speak with him before he recovered from the Condition in which he appeared upon his Trial, declared he had known him guilty of several Things of this Kind; and that, had he not been taken and tried for this barbarous Murder, several Prosecutions were entered against him upon that Account. To this he himself added some corroborating Circumstances, and owned (tho' he would not say any Thing to lay Imputation upon himself) that the Evidence and Fullager had endeavoured to draw him into divers Villainies of that Sort, but that he refused to be concerned; so that his Way of Life being uncertain for some Time past, the above Circumstances give Room sufficient to presume, that he was one of that great Number of wicked Men, who, by their Artifices, daily cheat the true Executors of poor Seamen, who have ventured their Lives (if not lost them) in getting that little Money which is thus villainously kept from the right Owners thereof. He own'd, in the general, that he had been a very wicked Man, and deserved whatever Punishment should be thought proper to be inflicted upon him.</p>

            <p>For a Week, or ten Days after Conviction, he continued in the same senseless Condition he appeared in when he was tried. The first Time I found him capable of understanding and speaking, I applied to him to make Confession of this barbarous Fact; assuring him, by all the Arguments I was Master of, that to die with a Lie in his Mouth would be an absolute Bar to his future Happiness, and that he could never conceive in his Mind any Hopes of Salvation, unless hehad Grace enough to own such a Fact, if he was guilty of it, as had brought on him the Odium of all Mankind, the Cesure of the Laws, and the Wrath and Displeasure of the Almighty. His Answer was for this Time, I am as innocent as the Child unborn; and he repeated some other Words to the same Purpose.</p>
            <p>The next Time I talked to him, I gave him to understand, that, to deny the Truth, and persist in it, was flying in the Face of God; and that if he so left the World, eternal Damnation must be his Doom. To which he replied, after some Hesitation: Sir, Would you have me own myself to be guilty of what I know no more of than you do? I know, if I be guilty, and deny it, I must send my Soul to the Bottom of Hell; which I hope I know better than to do. And in all our Talk, which was chiefly to this Purpose, he persisted to deny that he knew any Thing of the Murder; saying, You will hear in Time, that poor Rosa's Life was sworn away wrongfully. Besides all this, other Protestant Clergymen talked to him upon this Affair; but notwithstanding all the Arguments and Persuasions they made use of, he still continued to declare his Innocence to them also.</p>
            <p>Tho' to refuse to give Credit to a Person in this unhappy Situation, upon the Verge of Death, seems somewhat hard and uncharitable; yet, when we come to consider the Nature of the Evidence against him, which was so strong, and well-connected, that we cannot but believe him guilty. If so, how miserably must he have deceived himself! But God only knows the Certainty of the Matter.</p>

But as this Knife tallied so nearly with the Holes made in the Coat, and Waist-coat, and Body of Fargues, as near as could be expected; it seems (tho' inanimate) to cry out loudly against him for Vengeance for Mr. Fargues's Blood, besides several other concurring Circumstances, However, the Fact he would not own, tho' called upon and persuaded by several People; and when at last, I begged of him to tell the Truth, before he was deprived of the Power of Speech, he declared immediately before he suffered, that he knew nothing of the Matter.</p>

He was convicted of the Murder for which he suffered, very justly, which himself owns in all its aggrivating Circumstances. There was for sometime after this Conviction, a mighty Tryal, whether he should dye a Roman Catholick or a Protestant: And tho' he declared himself a Protestant on his Tryal, and excepted against Gentlemen of the Foreign Jury, supposing them to be Roman Catholicks; yet the Gentleman who generally attends Roman Catholicks in this unhappy Situation, (not being Master of the Italian himself) took upon him to bring another</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175203230011"/>
            <p>Gentleman of the same Order, to be his Confessor, and Ghostly Father.</p>
            <p>The poor Fellow laboured for some Time under his pressing Importunities, to make Confession to him after the Form and Manner of the Church of Rome, but he still declin'd it. He owned in general to him, that he had been a bad Man, but would not sue for the Absolution in Form; yet, if I mistake not, the Gentleman was forward enough to give it him; and this he declared before two Gentlemen, the Reverend Mr. Majendie, and the Reverend Mr. Palermo, both Protestant Clergy, who understood the Italian Language, and repeated to me in plain English, what Geraldine had said. We were led into this Enquiry by the aforesaid Gentleman's coming again, after having absented for some Time, to visit Geraldine. It surprized me pretty much that he should come again, after I had been assured by the Reverend Gentlemen above mention'd, that Geraldine declared in the Sincerity of his Heart, that the Protestant Religion was the only true Religion, and most consistent with the Doctrine of the Gospel, and freest from Superstitious Errors; that he depended on no Intercession of Saints or Angels, on no Ave Marias, but on the Intercession of Christ, and his Merits, from whom alone he hoped for Absolution and Remission of all his Sins, upon this true Repentance. And, as far as one Man may judge of another, he did seem to dye a true Penitent, by what I heard of his Prayers in Latin, and by what that Gentleman told me of their Discourse with him in Italian. But, what was particularly worth Notice, when the Roman Catholick Gentleman found he could not prevail with Geraldine to dye in that Faith, (as Geraldine declared to the Reverend Mr. Majendie, and Mr. Palermo, which they repeated to me in plain English) the said Catholick Gentleman did threaten him, and that in an authorative Manner, to write to the Convent in Italy, where he was brought up, to make known that he was hanged in England, or in Words to that effect. The poor Fellow was horribly shock'd at this, having Relations there, who according to the Custom of that Country would suffer in their Character, and be despised upon Account of his unhappy Fate, were it there known. Thank Heaven, such Christianity dwells not in England! However he resolved to dye a Protestant, and frequently repeated it before several Gentlemen, that he rejoiced, God had put it into his Heart so to do. He forfeited his Life willingly to satisfy the Laws, and sought only the Salvation of his Soul upon his Repentance thro' the alone Merits of Jesus Christ. His Resolution in this Point is evident from a Letter in Italian in Mr. Palermo's Possession, subscribed by the unhappy Geraldine, of which the following is the Copy, viz.</p>
            <p>To the Reverend Mr. Palermo.</p>
            <p>Reverend Sir,</p>
            <p>THIS being the last Day of my Life, I should commit a Sin of Ingratitude, if I did not acknowledge the Obligations I have to you, for the Fatigue, Expence, and even Sickness, that you have undergone, upon my Account. I have been assisted by you, Sir, together with the Help also of some other Benefactors, to this last Day; by you, with whom I had not so much as any Acquaintance, until a few Days before my being condemn'd; and all this without any Expectation of Advantage to yourself, which my Poverty left no Room for, but merely out of Compassion and Charity towards a Brother Proselite, who was unacquainted with the Language, and known but by few Persons in this Country. It would have been happy for me had I known you at my first coming to London, for then I really believe that the unfortunate Death of poor Albani had never happened: of which I declare myself guilty before God and Man.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175203230012"/>
            <p>After all, To-morrow I shall suffer Death, as the least Part of Atonement for mine Offences, and I look for Salvation only, thro' the infinite Mercy of God, in Jesus Christ, my beloved Redeemer, to whom I return Thanks for granting me to die with my Senses entire; and in the Protestant Religion. Moreover, I am to return you Thanks on Account of the Light received through your Means, and the Reverend Mr. Majendie's, on Religion, when discoursing together in the Prison: Before you both came to me, I must own I was unsteady in my Notions about it, PARTLY thro' the Terrors that had been artfully suggested to me, by some Persons, whose Zeal is not according to Knowledge; and had not Providence sent you to me, I cannot say of what Persuasion I should have died; but now, by the Blessing of God upon your joint Labours, I am able to say, that I depart out of this World thoroughly penitent, and convinced of the Errors of the Church of Rome, and that the Protestant Religion is that of Christ and his blessed Apostles.</p>
            <p>This, Sir, is an Acknowledgement I owe to Truth, and to your tender Concern for my Soul; and as such, I make it frankly, and without the least Reserve. Inclined as you are to do Good, you will doubtless give me Leave to recommend to you my unfortunate Wife, lately brought to Bed of a Son in Brownlow-Street Hospital, intreating you to afford them what Assistance they may stand in Need of hereafter, as they are poor and innocent of the Crime, I am shortly to suffer for; and particularly beseeching you, if possible, to get the Child to be admitted into the Foundling-Hospital, and educated in the Protestant Religion. May God Almighty return you a hundred-fold the Kindness you have shewn me, and the Service you shall do to those I leave behind me. My Hopes are, that we shall meet together in Heaven. In the Interim, do me the Favour to return my best Thanks to the Reverend Mr. Majendie, to Mr. <persName id="OA17520323n59-1">

They came unprovided with any Vehicle for that Purpose, and when the Bodies were cut down the Friends scarce had thought of the Matter how to convey them away. The poor Fellow murdered had brought his Cart and Horses there, as the Custom is, to get a few Pence by letting People stand up in it to see the Execution. After it was over, Mac Gennis, and his Party, seeing the Cart near the Gallows, took it from the Driver by Force, and puttingthe Bodies into it, drove to <placeName id="OA17520323-geo-76">

The Man was waiting, and upon their Return, for seizing hold of his Horse's Head, was treated very ill by several present; but being determined, if possible, to recover his own Cart and Horses from them, would not let the Horse's Head go, tho' much threatned. This he persisted in, and upon that Account received a Blow with a Hanger, which did his Business. Who did it we have no Authority yet to say, unless that of the Court and Jury, who convicted Mac Gennis, upon full Evidence, unimpeached; and as the Scheme set up to prove the contrary did not succeed, we can scarce believe, but that he was justly convicted, and suffered accordingly.</p>
            <p>He has been very ill most Part of the Time since his Conviction, but for some Days before Execution he became more hearty, and was in good Health when he suffered, being as tight a little Man as might swing on Tyburn Tree: The Lord have Mercy on him.

            <p>The Fact for which she was convicted was very plainly proved, though she declared herself innocent to the last; not remembering, that when before the Court, she seemed to put her Defence upon acting in Company of her Husband, and under his Influence; yet when she saw it went hard against her, she thought to move the Compassion of the Court by saying, she had six fatherless Children. It appeared upon the Tryal, that she robbed three Men in one Night: And if so, how many might have met with the same Usage at her House, since her Time?

And notwithstanding the gentle Admonitions of the Recorder, was scarce prevailed on to forbear an audacious Grin, which for most Part of the Time he either affected, or proceeded from his Insensibility.</p>
            <p>Broughton and Hayes had no sooner received Sentence of Death than they began to contrive how to escape from that terrible Death, notwithstanding they pretended so little to regard it; not that they might live to be better Men, but that they might have Opportunity to do more Mischief. They consulted immediately <persName id="OA17520323n107-1">

They then also meditated the Murder of the Turnkey, but for that Time were disappointed; and their Intention being discovered, were ordered by Mr. Akerman to be chained down to the Floor in their Cells, double-ironed; which was accordingly done. And so they remained, till having gone through the Discipline of their Confessor, and received Absolution, they began to contrive how to be guilty of Villainy afresh, and resolved upon doing what should make them more notorious than they were before.</p>
            <p>Their Revenge and Malice was still fixed on the Turnkey, Mr. Sinclair, whom they had conceived an inveterate Hatred against, upon account of his having kept out People from going into the Press-yard to see them, whom he looked upon as dangerous to the Safety of the Gaol. In order to bring about this their hellish Design, on Friday, the 20th Instant, having artfully gotten some Knives, they made Saws of them, with which they cut off their Irons. Then, in the Evening, as Sinclair was gone into the Pressyard, as usual, to see that all Things were well, they suddenly rushed out of the Cells upon him; and each having a Knife, Broughton first cut him over the Face several Times. Sinclair, being quite unarmed, opposed as well as he could, and took one of them up in his Arms, and threw him a great Way from him. Upon which Hayes came up to him, and cut him a-cross, just under the Stomach, in so violent a Manner, as has almost cost the poor Man his Life, who has a Wife and several Children. After this was done, they went up and down the Press-yard and Cells, brandishing their Knives, and threatening every one, if they offered to oppose, or make any Noise, to cut their Throats. One Man they did cut and flash very cruelty, and used more Violence about him, than has been the Death of many a Person. But luckily one Darby shut the main Door of the Cells upon them, or more Mischief might have ensued.</p>
            <p>Such Behaviour as this gave great Trouble to several, and put the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs to the Trouble of coming to put an End to it. And when Hayes and Broughton were by Force brought down before them, in order to be ironed afresh, and hand cuffed, they behaved with such unparalleled Assurance as never was seen, notwithstanding all the Admonitions and Reproofs his Lordship was pleased to make use of to them; such as, one would have thought, were sufficient to have moved the greatest Barbarian any Kingdom could give Birth to.</p>
