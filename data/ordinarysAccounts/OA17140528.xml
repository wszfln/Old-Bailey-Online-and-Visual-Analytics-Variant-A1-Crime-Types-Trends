            <p>THE Ordinary of NEWGATE HIS ACCOUNT OF The Behaviour, Confessions, and Last Speeches of the Malefactors that were Executed at Tyburn, on Friday the 28th of May, 1714.</p>
            <p>AT the Sessions held at Justice-Hall in the Old baily, on Thursday the 13th, and Friday the 14th of May, 1714, Nine Persons, viz. Seven Men and Two Women that were Try'd for, and found Guilty of several Capital Crimes, receiv'd Sentence of Death accordingly. But one of the Women being Pregnant, and the other, with Four of the Men, having obtain'd HER MAJESTY's Gracious Reprieve (which I wish they may duly improve) Three only are now order'd for Execution.</p>
            <p>While they lay under this Condemnation, I constantly visited them; having them brought up (twice every Day) to the Chapel of Newgate, where I pray'd with them, and instructed them in the Word of GOD, of which they were very ignorant before, tho' most of them could read well. I endeavour'd to make them sensible of the heinousness of their Offences, and of the absolute Necessity of Faith and Repentance, in order to their obtaining Pardon and Salvation through CHRIST.</p>
            <p>On Whitsunday, the 16th instant, I preach'd to them and others there present, both in the Morning and Afternoon, upon Joh. 15. 26. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father, He shall testify of Me.</p>
            <p>As I had, on the Lord's Day before, begun to discourse on these Words, so on this I further enlarg'd upon them; prosecuting the same Subject (as proper for the Day) and shewing, that in the Text, we have,</p>
            <p>I. An Account (in general) of the Sacred Trinity, viz.</p>
            <p>1. The Father, from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds.</p>
            <p>2. The Son, who sends the Holy Spirit from the Father.</p>
            <p>3. The Holy Spirit, who emanates and proceeds eternally from both the Father and the Son.</p>
            <p>In the Name of which Three Persons, (who are Coessential and Coeternal, and One only GOD) the Apostles were, and all their Successors, the Ministers of CHRIST are, commanded to Baptize.</p>
            <p>II. A Description (in particular) of the Third Person, viz. the Holy Ghost: Wherein we may observe,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA171405280002"/>
            <p>1. His Name of Comforter.</p>
            <p>2. The Act of His Coming.</p>
            <p>3. His being Sent, viz. 1st, By the Son, 2dly, From the Father, 3dly, Unto the Apostles and their Followers.</p>
            <p>4. His Character, which is a Spirit, or rather, The Spirit; yea, The Spirit of Truth.</p>
            <p>5. His Procession, as from the Father, so likewise from the Son.</p>
            <p>6. and lastly, His Testimony of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Having enlarg'd upon these, and shew'd; That this Doctrine of the Blessed TRINITY is a great Mystery, which (though beyond our Apprehension, yet) we are bound to believe upon the Revelation we have of it, both in this Text, and other Scriptures; I then made it appear, How we ought to live the Life of Holy Faith, Love, and Fear; and in this Disposition humbly serve and adore our Good GOD, who is so Great, so Excellent, and so Incomprehensible: How we ought to grieve and repent when we have offended that Glorious and Happy BEING, that is both able and willing to make us all glorious and happy with Him, if we do sincerely endeavour to deny all Ungodly, and Worldly Lusts, and live Soberly, Righteously, and Godly in this present World, - &amp;c. as the Apostle exhorts, Tit. 2. 12. This Duty I inforc'd (particularly) upon the Condemn'd Persons: To whom,</p>
            <p>On Trinity-Sunday, the 23d instant, I preach'd again (both in the Morning and Afternoon) upon part of the Gospel for the Day, viz. St. John 3. 3. JESUS answer'd, and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a Man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>From these Words, first explain'd in general, with their Context, I then endeavour'd to shew in particular,</p>
            <p>I. What it is to be born again.</p>
            <p>II. What is here meant by the Kingdom of GOD, and the Seeing of it.</p>
            <p>III. How much it concerns every one to labour after Regeneration, or the New Birth, mention'd in the Text; because, without it, it is impossible to see the Kingdom of GOD, i. e. To be admitted into His Kingdom of Grace in this World, and to the blessed Enjoyment of His Kingdom of Glory in the next.</p>
            <p>IV. How an old Habit of Sin, to which unthinking Carnal Men insensibly arrive by degrees, is directly opposite to this New Birth, and consequently a perfect Hindrance to the Attainment both of the Kingdom of Grace here, and the Kingdom of Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>V. ult. What effectual means Men may, and ought to use for their being Renew'd and Born again, so as to be enabl'd to recover themselves out of those Sins into which they have unhappily fallen, and by such Recovery escape the dreadful Punishment they had deserv'd, and regain both the Favour of GOD they had forfeited, and His Kingdom of Grace and Glory, which they had lost.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA171405280003"/>
            <p>Having enlarg'd upon all these Heads and Particulars, I concluded at this, as at other times before, with such pressing Exhortations to the Condemn'd Persons, as I thought most conducive to the begetting in them a true Sense and sincere Repentance of their Sins; together with a Spirit of Love to GOD, and their Neighbour, and a due Concern for their own Souls. Thus I endeavour'd to perswade them to redeem the Time they had mispent, and to call upon GOD for Grace, by the Power of which they might recover themselves, and be brought out of their Spiritual Death, and made alive to GOD; that so their Temporal Death in this World (which was approaching) might be a happy Passage to their Eternal Life in that to come.</p>
            <p>When I had them under Examination in private, such of them as are now appointed for Execution, gave me the respective Accounts of themselves, which follow.</p>
