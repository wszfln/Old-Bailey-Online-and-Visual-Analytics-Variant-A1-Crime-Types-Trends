But he has since fallen into bad Company, and deservedly paid for it with the Loss of his Reputation, and Life.</p>
            <p>His Confession is that with Respect to the Robbery for which he is to dye, he is certainly guilty in Fact, but that he never intended any such Thing, till he was overpersuaded by his Accomplices, but a little while before they met the Persons they robbed. And, he says, that one of the Accomplices, being a Witness against him at his Tryal laid to his Charge what he took upon himself to act when the Robbery was committed, but being better vers'd, and more knowing, he slipt his own Neck from the Halter, and put it about his (Rogers's.)</p>

However, he says being but young in the Practice of Thievery, his Mind seem'd to relent, and his Heart misgave him. While they were opening the Bundle to examine what they had got, he says, he declared his Remorse at robbing the poor People, who he concieved might perhaps be ruin'd and thrown into Prison, for having lost the Linnen, and not being in a Capacity to make it good; that after they had curs'd him for a Fool, and a chicken-hearted Fellow, he left the Room, seemingly resolved to have no Share of the wicked, and to him justlyfatal Bargain. But when they told him of fine Napkins, Sheets and other Linnen to the Value of 100 l. he was inticed to cast in his Lot among them, and to receive thereof his Portion.</p>

However, he never would own that he had committed any Robbery besides what he dyed for, tho' Gaming, and Robberies are said by such, as knew him, to have been his constant Employ for some Time past; and every one almost is sensible, what is likely to be the Consequence of such Practises as these. If he had any more of these Tricks, he was very close, and determined to keep them to himself, as well as he could, he always pretended to be very Penitent, and appeared so to the last; Christian Charity obliges to hope, and wish, that he might really have been in earnest.</p>

As he was going out of his Mistresses House, betwixt three and four o'Clock, to serve the Cattle, Murphy and Hayes, and others went up to him in the Yard; and they secured is Lanthorn presented a Pistol to him, and ordered him not to speak a Word. Then they would have had him to open a Spring-Lock of the Door, that they might get in the easier, and because he would not, they threatned to cut his Throat; and having tyed him to a Post at the Door, and left two Men to guard him, left he might come to the Assistance of the House, they opened a Window-Shutter, went in at it, and took the Lanthorn in; then they opened the Door on the Inside, and proceeded to Business.

The Maid's screaming awakened the Mistress, and leaving two Men to guard her, they went to her Room, where they found her too at the Window screaming, whom they took away, and dragging her about the Room, trod upon her, and abused her very much.</p>

In the Interim up came Murphy on Horseback; Mr. Delaporte imagining it might be some Passenger, from whom he might have some Help, cried out, For God's Sake don't murder me: On which Murphy held up his huge Club, and swore he would beat out his Brains if he did not hold his Tongue, and go instantly into the Field. They took him into the Field about 40 or 50 Yards from the Road, and then examined him more nicely, and, in a little private Pocket, they found two Rings, one Gold, set with Diamonds, the other Gold, with a Picture of the Prince of Wales. They took from him a Pair of Silver Buckles, a Pair of Gold Buttons out of his Sleeves, a green Velvet Waistcoat, a Handkerchief, a Hanger, a Cravat, a Lac'd-Hat, and a Wig; they also took his Spurs off, but in their Hurry dropped one, which was found next Morning. After all this was done they flung Mr. Delaporte on the Grass, tied his Hands together, and put one of his Legs through, and telling him if he stirr'd from thence 'till they retured they would blow out his Brains, they left him, where he continued about a Quarter of an Hour, by which Time he thought they were got far enough off, and then he got up, and went to the Thatch'd-House, where he related the Manner of his Usage, and likewise found his Horse, which Murphy had turned up there.</p>
