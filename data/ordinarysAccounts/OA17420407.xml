            <p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p>
            <p>The following Letter was sent to Dr. HENRY in Hatton-Garden, next Holborn, from a Patient, a Gentleman of known Veracity, who for the Benefit of Others in this Disorder, desires it may be made publick, which the Reader may take in his own Words following.</p>
            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>I Have the Happiness to inform you, that I am in all Appearance entirely cured of my terrible Headach, and nervous Disorder, which had so grievously afflicted me for two Years successively; I have not perceived the least remaining Symptoms of it these six Mouths past. The present Health I now enjoy, compared with the Memory I still retain of my insupportable Disorder, is so joyful a Change to me, that it would be the greatest Ingratitude should I longer delay to return you my heatty Thanks and Acknowledgment in this publick Manner, who, under God have been the Restorer of my Health, even beyond what every one thought possible, or could have any Reason to hope for.</p>
            <p>I here send you a true State of my Illness, to the End that those whose Unhappiness it is to be so afflicted, may, by reading what you have done for me, be encouraged to try the same Advice and Remedies, which if they do, they may safely promise themselves the same Success.</p>
            <p>The first beginning of my Illness was going to the <placeName id="OA17420407-geo-1">

I applied to the most eminent Physicians, who only told me it was a nervous Complaint, produced from Excess of Heat, which had stagnated the Juices of the Brain; and after Blistering, Bleeding, Cupping, and a deal of other Means, there was hardly any Relief. It would rage to such a Degree that I was almost distracted; at length it turned to a Vertigo, Giddiness, and Swimmings of the Head. My Pain was mostly in the hinder Part, with beating Noise of Wind, but at Times would lie with such a Weight upon my fore Part of my Head and Eyes, that I was afraid I should entirely lose my Sight; all which affected the Nerves, as brought a Paralyrick Trembling and Weakness all over my Body, with sometimes Convulsions; and the Use of my Speech much impared: I had no Rest Night nor Day, but was huried with confused and irregular Thoughts; my Stomach and Bowels would swell with Wind, then would fly to the Head, and bring on most of the aforesaid Disorders, with a strong Palpitation and trembling of the Heart. This was my miserable Case, and tho' a young Man, had given over Hopes of a Cure, 'till a Gentleman who had been almost in the same Condition as mine, and cured by your nervous Medicine, advised me to apply to you, as the only Person for the Cure of nervous Disorders, which accordingly I did; and sent for a Bottle of your nervous Medicine, with the Pills and Cephalick Snuff for the Head, which cost me Seven Shillings, and was presently relieved: so in a Month's Time I was entirely relieved, freed from my Disorders, and have not taken any Thing these six Months, and have no Apprehension of my Illness returning; for which I return you my most grateful Thanks, under Divine Providence, for my present happy State of Health, which is entirely owing to you.</p>
            <p>SIR, Your obliged humble Servant.</p>

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174204070004"/>
            <p>of God, Psalm l. 23. From whence I took Occasion to show, that in all our Actions, and through all the Events of Life, it was our indispensable Duty to acknowledge the Goodness of Almighty God, to magnify and adore him for his inestimable Love vouchsafed to us, in sending his only begotten Son into the World to die for our Sins, and to offer up himself a Sacrifice, as an Attonement to reconcile incensed Divine Justice, and miserable lost Man.</p>
            <p>As they were all convicted for Theft and Robbery, I thought it not improper to lay before them in the strongest Terms, the unlawfulness of the Sin of Coveteousness, and to shew them how directly contrary the Commission of that Sin was to the express Commands of God, and the Duties taught by Scripture, thro' every Stage of Life. Even in our early Days we are taught in our Catechism not to covet or desire other Men's Goods, but to learn and labour truly to get our own Livings, and to do our Duty in that State of Life unto which it shall please God to call us; the coveting after the perishing Riches and fading Enjoyments of this World can afford us no real Satisfaction, but on the contrary load us with Cares, Troubles, and Anxieties of Soul and Conscience, they are such Acts of Injustice as make Men odious to God, and unfit for human Society; and besides the dreadful Punishment of an hereafter, they are here subject to Pains and Penalties, even Death itself.</p>
            <p>As they had but a short Time to live in this World, they were seriously and fervently desired to prepare for their Reception in the next, and to think seriously of that great Change which in a very few Moments they must of Necessity make. In order to which they should not only reflect with Horror on the Wickedness and Sinfulness of their Lives, of the innumerable Instances of their having broken the Commands of Almighty God, and thereby rendered themselves liable to Divine Wrath and Vengeance, both in this Life and that which is to come: But that they should also on Reflection turn unto God with their whole Hearts, humbly implore the Divine Goodness to have Mercy on their lost Souls, and to receive them once more into his Favour.</p>
            <p>They were likewise carefully instructed in the Nature of the Holy Sacrament, and taught that by their being made Partakers thereof, they renewed their Baptismal Vows, and prepared themselves for a more joyful Reception in the World to come.</p>
            <p>While these and such like Instructions were given, they came to Chapel, and behaved decently as People under their most unhappy Circumstances. <persName id="OA17420407n27-1">

He wept plentifully, and though he could not evade the positive Evidence of three Witnesses, who swore when he was taken up, as soon as he saw Colt he fell upon his Knees, and begged him not to prosecute him, for if he did he should be hanged, which an innocent Man would hardly have done.

Being asked the Reason of such on Attempt, he said 'twas on Account of his great Want, and his Wives unkindness in marrying or co-habiting with another Man before he was dead; however he was very sharply reproved by all the rest of his Fellow Sufferers, particularly by Mrs. Brown. I also endeavoured to convince him how great a Sin that of Self-Murther was, that he had already been but too great a Sinner, and that this was heaping Crime upon Crime, just at a Time too when he was or should be endeavouring to make his Peace with an offended tho' merciful God; he wept bitterly, promised not to attempt the like any more, (though this was his 2d Attempt) and said he hoped in God's Mercy for Forgiveness through Christ, that he repented of all his Sins, and heartily forgave all Men.</p>

            <p>It happened, he met with me, upon which, I rode up to him, with the usual Word, desiring him not to be 'frighted, but I must have his Money. He rode from me, but People of our Business, seldom having bad Horses, I overtook him, and swore I would shoot him. He not stopping, I cross'd the Road upon him, thinking he could not jump over me, but he turned back and rode up to Easter, who was in the Road at a Distance, and said, Sir, I am likely to be robbed, for that Man is a Highwayman! Sir, (said Easter) I am afraid you are, and taking hold of his Horse's Reins, pulled out a Pistol, and demanded his Money. Why (said the Gentleman) I took you for an honest Man! So I am (said Easter) because I rob the Rich to give to the Poor. I then jump'd off my Horse and made the Gentleman alight, and took from him a Gold Watch, a Diamond Ring, a Mourning Ring, a Guinea, one Shilling, and a Halfpenny; after which, we turned his Horse loose at a great Distance from him.</p>
            <p>After this, we rode about three Miles 'cross the Country, and then my Horse tiring, I put him into a Barn, and got up behind Easter, and rode with him two Miles, and then made him dismount; upon which, we had a few Words: but I threaten'd to shoot the Horse, and so made him easy.</p>
            <p>I then turned the Horse a-drift, and each of us threw away our Whips and Spurs, and walked about 8 Hours, and then Night coming on, we put up at the House of one Wall, a Butcher, at a Town in <placeName id="OA17420407-geo-145">

            <p>I made the best of my Way 'till I came to a Place called <placeName id="OA17420407-geo-177">

Upon his meeting me, he asked me, if I had not seen a stray Horse, I told him, I had not, upon which, he rode past me about 50 Yards, and then turned back upon me.</p>
            <p>I having a guilty Conscience, presently knew him to be one Hunt, my Master's Smith, and when we came to a House, he told me, he must speak with me, and I should stop: I answered him, that I was upon hasty Business, and he, nor no Man should stop me; upon which, he drew a Ctlass, and aim'd a Blow at my Head, which I made him repent, for having a Hedging Bill in my Hand, I was obliged to fight to vindicate myself, chusing rather to suffer Death than to go back to be used in such a barbarous Manner as I should have been.</p>
            <p>I therefore endeavoured to do him as much Mischief as he did me, but, to my great Joy, I did not kill him, for I only struck him on the Arm, and knocked him off his Horse:</p>

            <p>I then examined the Chamber, and found 2 very fine Gold Rings in a little Drawer, which I tied up in my Apron, and then went up another Pair of Stairs with a Design of jumping out of the Window into the Garden, but being afraid of breaking my Neck, I last determined to take Courage and run out, and as I came down, the Stairs creaked all the Way, which terrified me a little, but however, when I got to the middle, I jumped quite down facing the Parlour Door, which surprizing the Lady, she dropt her Tea, and fell a screaming as if she had been murder'd, but notwithstanding that, I open'd the Street-Door and ran off.</p>

            <p>After Supper, I and one Purvis went to Cards, and he losing all his Money, we gave him the Drop, but he went somewhere by himself towards Norfolk-Street, and brought away a Suit of Clothes, in one of the Pockets of which was a Purse and some Money, and other Things. He found out where I was drinking, and brought these Clothes to me, and desired me to lend him Money upon them, that he might go to Play, accordingly I did, and I put the Clothes under the Bench where I was sitting, thinking they would be safe there; but I was mistaken, for when Purvis had lost all his Money, and I went to look for the Clothes, they were gone.</p>
            <p>Purvis being enraged at this, went before a Justice, with a View of being admitted an Evidence, and Coates and myself were taken up, but the Justice admitted Coates to be an Evidence, so that Purvis and I were tried; but we had the good Fortune to be acquitted of the Fact we were charged with, which was, breaking a House in <placeName id="OA17420407-geo-233">

            <p>I thought I might then have an Opportunity of getting something, so I concealed myself in the Stable Yard till I saw him and his Man set out, and then I robbed the Stable of a fine Bridle, adorned with Silver Bosses, and some other Things, together with the Servants Great Coat, under which I concealed what I had taken.</p>
            <p>I have for some Time before my Conviction committed these and many other Facts of the like Nature, and can only say, that the Punishment I am to suffer is what I have deserved, and that every one who follows the same Courses as I have done, must expect that they will sooner or later terminate in an untimely and ignominious Death.</p>
