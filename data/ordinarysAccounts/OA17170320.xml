But as for making any further Confession, he desir'd not to be put upon it, nor to have any thing offer'd to him contrary to his own Principles; for as he was brought up, and always had lived a Member of the Church of Rome, so he resolv'd to die in that Communion.</p>

Why should you suppose me to have committed those Facts, when I was clear'd of 'em?
