When he was urged to give glory to God and satisfaction to the world, by an open confession of his crimes, he answered, that he owned the fact for which he died, and his guilt in several of the like kind; but said that particular confessions were too much like Popery; and asked, Can words make restitution? To which he was answered, No, but they may give much ease of mind, and much satisfaction to the injured, and that as words had saved his life when admitted an evidence, why might they not be the means to save his soul? Ives had declared several times he would write his life for the good of the printers and his brother trade; but on the 2d of June declared angrily that he had burnt it. This might be occasioned partly by a spirit of resentment and opposition, and partly because he apprehended it contained something unbecoming that profession of penitence which he put on.</p>
            <p>The following story of a very critical situation he was reduced to, having a rope about his neck in order to be hanged once before, came from his own mouth, after he was in custody for the robbery of Mr. H - n - ll, committed last winter. The occasion was at <placeName id="OA17640611-geo-31">

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176406110008"/>
            <p>shew you where to get money enough." He readily agreed. They all sat down and drank the rum, and then set forward to plunder. They found the house unguarded by any but the old gentleman, who being unable to resist them; they took each of them as much gold, in bags, as they were able to carry. Ives hid his bag in a cask of flour, and headed it up again. Being quickly pursued, detected and taken, their lives were forfeited, but on making restitution of what was found upon them, they were indulged with the favour of casting lots, by which one of the ring-leaders and Ives were allotted to suffer. On the point of execution the adjutant declared he still had power to save one of them, and gave the preference to Ives, who was unhappily reserved for a more public and exemplary fate at the metropolis of the empire. 'Tis probable Ives drew some hope and consolation from the recital of this story in the hearing of his prosecutor, whilst he was in a coach carrying him to gaol, under his pressing calamity of being a prisoner for the capital crime of burglary, flattering himself that as he was so favoured in that deliverance so he might be again and again, though he went on still in his wickedness. It is true he did escape once more from the near prospect of death, but he did not yet learn to beware of abused patience and mercy.</p>
            <p>Let us now be permitted to anticipate another of his confessions made on the morning of execution, tho' not to the proper officer. He was asked by Mr. M - les, one who was requested to put this question to him, "Jack, did you rob the house of Mr. R - g - rs, at <placeName id="OA17640611-geo-32">
                  <interp inst="OA17640611-geo-32" type="type" value="parish"/>

I took only 5l. in money, a few silver spoons, and other trifles, but did not touch a large quantity of plate, linen, &amp;c. of value, that lay in my way." The gentleman who desired this question to be asked for his own satisfaction, on receiving this answer, confirmed the truth of it, saying, the case was so; adding that the 5l. then stolen was Christmas-box money belonging to his apprentice or servants which lay in the way; and that the thief must have got in thro' a neighbouring house then repairing. It must be owned this readiness in Ives to give this kind of satisfaction (the best in his power) to the injured, was conformable to that advice so often inculcated to criminals, but their pride and perverseness will not always suffer them to follow it.</p>
            <p>When taken and examined for this last fact laid in the indictment, he strongly insisted on his innocence ever since his last escape, till he was told by Mr M - n we can prove you have been at it again; upon which a certain Jew being produced</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176406110009"/>
            <p>he dropt that plea, shook his hand at him, and cursed him, as if dreading the force and effect of his evidence. It is affirmed that he boasted to his confidents, he had made an 100l. in his way since he was last at liberty. I was also well informed he was under no necessity to return to stealing through want, as he often pretended, a means being pointed out to him of getting honest bread, by one of his best friends, but the power of evil habits and company prevailed over all better considerations, as he confessed with his last breath at the place of execution.</p>

For about a week before his execution he was much afflicted with an ague, caused partly by distress and short supplies of sustenance, as he had few relations or friends in England to assist him. After his confession he declared he found his mind lighter and eased of that load of guilt which before lay so heavy on him, and to the last seemed calm, patient, humble, and resigned, acknowledging the justice of his sentence.</p>

The account he gave of the theft was, that he went into the pawn-broker's shop in the morning to pawn a handkerchief to raise a few pence for his breakfast, but seeing an opportunity, by no one's being in the shop, of stealing the watches, rings, &amp;c. his extreme necessity, urged him and the devil put it into his head to take them, which he did and was taken in the fact.

            <p>Morning of Execution.</p>
            <p>ENtering the Press-yard, they were found seriously employed in reading and praying. Being saluted and severally asked of their welfare, Ives said he was well and hearty, and appeared calm and chearful. Knight being ill of an ague-fit, now upon him, was dispirited; as also Overton, who was extreamly weak; but being very desirous to join in the offices on this last precious opportunity, was helped up to chapel.</p>
            <p>Fairbrother was chearful and composed. (Three of the respited criminals joined with them in prayers and the communion, but Gray withdrew from the latter, saying, when spoke to, that "he did not intend to communicate though he had not been respited." Two clergymen and another were present, and saw the convicts behave with humility, resignation and devotion. After a word of exhortation they went down, had their irons knocked off, were pinioned and put into 3 carts, viz. 3 in the first, and 2 in each of the 2d and 3d. All of which were hung in black, and two coffins placed in the front of one of them. Their apparent composure and disposition to pray when put in the several carts was much interrupted by the noise of the multitude, and some of their acquaintance taking leave of them. They got to the place of execution about a quarter after 10, and took up near half an hour to be moved all into one cart and tied up. Being then visited for the last office, they declared themselves composed and resigned. Redmond, being asked, refused to join with us in prayer, but stood back and read his own book; while Larey and Dixon joined with us, the latter holding one of our books in his hand. There was a vast croud all around to a considerable distance, who, at the request of the prisoners, joined in our prayers. At a proper pause Ives spoke and warned the people "to beware of the company of lewd women," which he repeated twice, adding, "for that brought me to ruin." "I was here, said he, at the last execution, as free as any one of you, and little thought of this my unhappy fate. God grant you all more grace than I have had." Redmond and Larey declared their innocence of the facts they died for. Larey said, he went out to call the watch to put an end to a quarrel</p>

            <p>which happened in the house where he was drinking. The rest were silent as to the people, but prayed earnestly, as did Ives and Dixon.</p>
            <p>Ives having a hint given him that Mr. H - nw - ll, one of his former prosecutors, was in a coach at hand, lifted both his hands, bowed and begged his forgiveness, which was freely granted; though he had neglected a better opportunity of doing the same in the press-yard the same morning, when that gentleman stood in his way for that very purpose; when instead of asking his pardon he said sullenly and without reflexion, "Now you have got your end. After the final blessing they returned their thanks, and a hearty blessing for the good offices done them, of which they expressed a lively sense. We parted: and they suffered their sentence.</p>

            <p>From the repeated positive evidence of the deceased, and the concurrent testimony of 5 or 6 other witnesses, there can be no doubt but the prisoner, and he only, gave those wounds, and was the murderer. There needed not, though there might have been more witnesses. The prisoner persisted to deny it very inconsistently, till word was brought to the justices at <placeName id="OA17640611-geo-58">

Now could it be expected after this, that this poor wretched criminal should relapse into a hardened liar as well as a murderer? if that evil-one, who was a murderer from the beginning, had not too much power over him, to deny his guilt without the least prospect of saving his credit, his character, or his life, is a degree of infatuation scarce to be credited; and yet such was his behaviour. No notice was given me that there was such a prisoner in the gaol, till after his conviction, nor did he ever desire to be brought to me (though daily at hand) for direction, advice, or assistance before his trial and sentence; otherwise he might have been brought to a better disposition. He was by trade a <rs id="OA17640611-occupation-31" type="occupation">woman's Shoe-maker</rs>

                     targets="OA17640611n54-1 OA17640611-occupation-31"/>, about 60 years of age, an Englishman by birth, rather small of stature and size. The deceased was a lusty tallish man, a <rs id="OA17640611-occupation-32" type="occupation">Rope-maker</rs>

They were scarce known to each other, but seem to have met accidentally at the prisoner's door, between 11 and 12 at night; and there appears to be little or no cause for this fatal quarrel, but that Turtle was much in liquor (in which case he was known to be as remarkably vexatious, as, it is said, he was quiet and inoffensive when sober). It is also believed he was inflamed with jealousy about a woman who lived with him as a wife, with whom he had got it in his head, the deceased was or would be too familiar, and therefore demanded a pot of beer from him, about which the quarrel began.</p>
            <p>Quickly after conviction he was visited, on Friday June the 8th, for better than half an hour, and again on Saturday before noon, and three times on Sunday, but still continued to deny the fact, answering to every motive that could be urged, "Sure you would not have me confess a lie!" and that he could not charge himself with having committed this crime. To palliate which, he told this story, That Chambers (whom he scarce knew by sight)</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176406110014"/>
            <p>wanted to intrude upon him as a lodger for that night, which Turtle refused saying, I am but a poor man, with one room, and have scarce a lodging for myself. On which Chambers struck him with his fist on the temple and knocked him down, so that he stumbled over the step of the door and broke his shin, of which he shewed me the scar, and also tore the skin off his knuckles, which, said he, are now healed, being five weeks ago, but pointed out the scars still remaining on them.</p>
            <p>Thus far he confessed; but when asked, what did you then? he pretended that being stunned and left on the ground with the blow, the deceased walked off and was absent near half an hour, and when he returned, cried out, he was stabbed. But who could stab him? that the convict would not pretend to answer, affecting to be very scrupulous and cautious of charging the fact on any other person by name, but supposed in his absence he had met with his match. Well! but did he not lay it to your charge from first to last, and this on oath before a magistrate? Oh, said he, he might be delirious. But did not all the witnesses prove the same on your trial? "That, he said, was nothing but spite and malice, and he knew the reason of it; insinuating as if there was a young woman who could prove otherwise: but they would let none come to the trial, except such as were of their own way of thinking." In this inconsistent and incredible way of excusing himself he persisted to the last, with many other falsehoods, asking, Would you have me charge myself with what I never did? adding, that he was easy in his mind and conscience, and clear of any such guilt; that he had no knife, nor was any knife found upon him or near him; nor could he get into his room to get a knife, being locked out by his wife. But beside that the contrary to all this is proved on the trial, it is well known in his neighbourhood, that the cries of Chambers, as soon as the fact was done, brought the witnesses, Roaper and his wife, Mrs. Israel, Mr. Martin, and the watch, about him, saying to them, "I am stabbed; my guts are coming out, &amp;c." and to Turtle (who was immediately secured, and beside whom no one else was near him when then the fact was done) "You rogue, you villain, you have stabbed me; I am a dead man;" which he often repeated. Turtle, being secured till examined next morning before justice Pell, then chairman of the committee at the London-Hospital, in the presence of Chambers then lying ill of his wounds, (but observed to be quite sensible and intelligent) when the prisoner being set before the wounded and dying man, he swore positively to him; he owned indeed that he had struck him first, and then Turtle went in for a knife, with which he stabbed him in 4 or 5 places. The justice then asked Chambers, Can you forgive this man? Chambers hesitated, saying with some emotion, "forgive him!" turning away his face, while the justice said to Turtle, do go over to him and ask his pardon; he muttered somewhat, as if reluctant; but the justice urging, Do, go to him, it will be better for you hereafter, Turtle went and begged his pardon; on which Chambers put out his hand, but did not or could not speak. This needs no comment to shew that it admits the accusation to be true on the part of both accuser and accused, however obstinately the latter denied it after conviction. And</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176406110015"/>
            <p>yet when he was prayed for as a murderer he did not interrupt nor object to it, only said he was never a very wicked man or a hardened sinner under which character he now was prayed for; he said, had he been really guilty of the fact, he never would have stood out in the denial of it for two hours after the fact. He owned indeed that the woman who lived with him as a wife was not married to him, but they lived together as if married. He would not own he had any jealousy of her, though this be strongly asserted by his neighbours who saw him in liquor that same night, and also much enraged, that he was for sometime locked out of his room by this woman; though it is said, she was only sitting on the stairs to avoid his usual abuse of her when in liquor. On questioning him about his past life, he told me, he had been an occasional communicant about nine years ago but never since, and seemed not earnestly to desire to be admitted to it now, nor would he prepare himself, but waved it rather than confess his notorious crime. He said he had been in the <rs id="OA17640611-occupation-33" type="occupation">marines</rs>

            <p>Morning of Execution.</p>
            <p>When visited, he was found weak and faint with long fasting, sitting on a form supported by his hand leaning on a table. Being saluted with peace, he answered, He hoped he should have peace. Being asked whether he would now confess his crime of murder, for which he is to suffer? he answered, He could say no more than he had told me yesterday, and that he was scarce able to speak, therefore desired to be asked no more questions; said he did not doubt but God would be his friend, "for that he had laboured with him in prayer 8 hours last night, and hoped he had prevailed." He was asked whether he believed all the articles of the christian faith? instead of a direct answer he said, he was bred a christian. Again, whether he believed the forgiveness of sins through the merits of Jesus Christ; and that there is no forgiveness without repentance? He answered, he had done all in his power to repent, and hoped he had repented, and did not much fear but he should find mercy. He consented to attend to some proper prayers, but said he was too weak either to go up to chapel, or receive the holy communion, or kneel or stand, but kept in the same posture of leaning on a table. Being desired to forgive and pray for all the world, especially his prosecutors, he consented, and said he had forgiven them five hours ago. He still expressly denied the murder before several witnesses, and yet expressed his hope of mercy. He was again warned against presumptuous hardness of heart, the crafts, assaults and delusions of the enemy of his salvation, in like manner as he was yesterday and the preceeding days more fully. But he still denied the fact, and said he had no knife. He now grew rather impatient, and expressed a longing desire to pay the debt of his life (so he expressed it) and for the present to be refreshed with a little wine. He was now reminded to think nothing of what he could suffer at present compared to what the tormented sinner must endure, like him who in the flames cried out for one drop of water to cool his tongue. He answered, "he did not complain though they refused him what he desired." A book being offered him, he refused it, saying, he could not see to read on the way through faintness. A person who charitably intended to accompany him, took the book;</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176406110016"/>
            <p>but when he began to represent to him how terrible it must be to go out of the world unprepared and impenitent, Turtle told him, if he had nothing else to talk of, he might go about his business. And so he left him.</p>
            <p>He was put into the cart about eight, and got to the place about nine, where he seemed still more faint and desirous to die speedily. Here he was again desired to consider whether by his being in liquor and the heat of passion, he might not know, or not remember what he did? but he said, he was not so much in liquor as not to know well what he was doing. He was further asked, whether he was easy in his mind? He made a motion to his breast to express he was so, and spoke it as well as his weakness would permit. Whether his conscience was clear and free from the guilt of this murder, for which he was now to suffer? He answered, It is; adding he had told all he knew of it, that the man went away from him after he had beat him down, and stayed away half an hour,  in the same story as yesterday;  that "he would say no other, if he to live an hundred years." He declared forgave all, and particularly the executioner, and kissed his hand; he prayed for and blessed me for what I had done for him. He consented to desire the people to pray for him, and I told him I must pray for him as guilty of this crime; he said, "he could not help that." Though impatient to die, he consented that I should repeat the belief to him, and then being particularly asked, he said, "All this I stedfastly believe." On his pressing me to hasten, I asked him whether he thought that death would put an utter end to his being? He said, " he trusted in God that he would take care of him." Prayers were shortened at his request, and on account of his faintness and want of spirit to attend. Being dismissed with prayers and blessings, he got ready to suffer. He appeared in tears just before he went off.</p>
