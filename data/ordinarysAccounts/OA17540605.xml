The reason of his discharge, he said, was upon account of his having lost the use of one of his hands by an accident, but another cause there really was, for those gentlemen always discharge suspected persons. He acknowledged to have been a very wicked and profligate liver, was unhappily ignorant, and of a surly cast of mind, and the fact he suffered for proved him to be of a savage and cruel nature to the last degree.</p>

When I cameto talk to him, he owned he had been a very bad man indeed, but as to the murder (though in the strongest terms I set forth to him the terrors of the Lord, in order to persuade him to acknowledgment of the truth) he persisted positively to declare his innocence, and that he knew nothing at all of the matter. As to other acts, whatever they were, they remain a secret, only known to God and himself; but this barbarously perpetrated a murder as it was, was done in consequence of an act of felony, of which kind it scarce was the first he was guilty of.

The thief came, the watch seized him among their master's greens, and secured him.</p>
            <p>The proper place for confining a thief taken in the night happened not to be fit to hold the man, and he was taken to the headborough's house by the three men that apprehended him. Two of the three went out again into the fields to see if any body else was stealing greens. The third unhappy man locked the door, where only now remained Bradford with him, and put the key in his pocket.</p>
            <p>Bradford finding himself alone, with but one to oppose, took a large poker that stood by the fire, and with several blows on the head, which had greatly fractured his skull, laid his guard dead at his feet, took the key out of his pocket, and made his escape. What a desperate mind must this murderer be of, who (to save himself from fear of the consequence of a felony, which could amount to no more than transportation for seven years) could conceive a thought to take away the life of a poor man who had done him no wrong! What a strong hold must the devil have had of his heart!</p>

            <p>Having now again been out of Place for some Time, he fell into another good Service; and, had he been faithful and just, he might have reaped the Benefits of a faithful and just Discharge of his Duty. The former Servant of a noble Lady being about to go into Business for himself, had given Notice of his Intention. It being known that one was wanted to supply his Place, Applications from several Persons were made to succeed him. Among the rest Parry wrote to solicit; who, besides writing a very good Hand, if I mistake not, had a Recommendation from the Person he was to succeed in this Service. And, accordingly, Parry was ordered to attend, and was hired in the Year 1750, where he continued 'till July 1753. Being looked upon as a good handy Fellow, and of good Appearance, he was frequently borrowed to wait at Table by Nobles of the Lady's Acquaintance, when they had any extraordinary Entertainment. He was very active, and would do the Work, and be as useful, as any other two or three People in waiting at Table.</p>
            <p>That he was valuable in any other Respect, I am not convinced from what I heard from him, or of him; whatever Value he might have for himself, or his Friends might think to have set upon him by Reports, which for no other but sinister Views could be propagated.</p>
            <p>In the Month of July, 1753, Parry was intrusted (by one who had Charity to think him very honest, tho' it turned out otherwise) and sent to his Lady's Banker's to receive a considerable Sum of Money, in order to pay off some Bills. And, as he was taken into Service to save the Lady the Trouble of such Affairs, 'tis no Wonder, (supposing him to be honest) that these Things were left to him. But</p>
            <p>He returned not Home 'till Afternoon, and before he came Home his Lady was gone Abroad to Dinner. However, he takes Occasion to write Receipts, as tho' the several Tradesmen had been paid, who had delivered in Bills. Or rather, he forged them, and when she came Home, gave them to his Lady.</p>
            <p>His Scheme began now to operate, and his bad Intention to work itself out into Practice. For, in about a Week, or little more, after this, he went off with about 1100 l. He kept back several hundred Pounds intrusted in his Hands, and took up besides several Sums of Money, as for her Use; which she, after his Flight, was obliged in Honour to pay, and did pay.</p>

            <p>All to the Amount as aforesaid of about 1100 l. Parry took Opportunity, while the Lady was out of the Way, (as her Manner was to go out to take an Airing to her Country Seat in the Morning, and return to Town to Dinner) to make off with.

            <p>Parry had no sooner got to Paris, but fine Cloaths, and making an Appearance, was the first Thing that his Mind attended to. And somehow he got into Acquaintance with an Irishman, a top Taylor there, and passing for a Gentleman of Wales, under the Name above-mentioned, gave Orders for Cloaths the most gay and fashionable. But the Taylor having had some Knowledge of Parry in England: the Cash was deposited before the Cloaths were worn; but he had but short Enjoyment of this Gaiety and Finery, e'er he was detected to be a Cheat and Impostor. However, while he had Opportunity, he made the most of himself, and appeared the great Man at all publick Places throughout the whole City of <placeName id="OA17540605-geo-30">

            <p>The noble Lady no sooner found he was gone off, and what Tricks he had played, than she applied to her Banker, who immediately wrote over to a Banker at Paris, to make some Enquiry after Parry. And, soon after Enquiry began to be made, he was discovered by his new Acquaintance the Taylor, who procured him to be taken at his Lodgings, while he was packing up his Cloaths, in order to decamp once more, and had him sent to Gaol.

When they desired him to dismount he began to be desperate, and attempted to make off; but they soon overpowered and took him, and found the Fellow-Pistol in his Pocket.

            <p>About 12 Months ago he married, and not being able to maintain a Wife by his own Gettings, he was prompted to do what brought him to Ruin. He had not been long with his Master in <placeName id="OA17540605-geo-92">

But, as it generally turns out, The Pitcher rarely goes so often to the Well, but it returns broken at last, he was not content to steal and rob his Master's Shop once, or twice, but was resolved, seemingly, to go on 'till he was discovered. Having privately laid a-side a Parcel of Handkerchiefs on a Saturday, they were observed, but not removed from where they were laid. The People of the Shop left them as they were in order to detect a Thief, who had robbed the Shop before this was found out. On the Sunday, as he was Porter in the House, he watched anOpportunity, and took them away. Upon which, as a Suspicion had been before conceived against Edom, a Search-Warrant found the Handkerchiefs, which had been lost, in his Lodgings, and he was committed to <placeName id="OA17540605-geo-93">

            <p>The next Day after he sent to a Peruke-maker in St. Martin's Lane to come to him, whose Shop he had used, and with whom he had lodged, at different Times, two Bundles of Goods, under Pretence of leaving them there, till he had an Opportunity to send them to Scotland. The Man came, and Edom told him he was sent there for stealing a Trifle of Thread from his Master, and begged he would appear for him at his Trial, and bring others, whom he had been Servant to formerly, with him. The Man immediately suspected the Parcels of Goods, left at his House by Edom, were not honestly come by, so he carried the Parcels to his Masters Shop in <placeName id="OA17540605-geo-94">

            <p>Upon this Trial the Goods were sworn to be their Property, and Edom made, if any Defence, a bad one. For, he said, he had been in Business before he came into their Service, which seemed to intimate a Claim to the Goods which were sworn to be his Master's Property; and the Jury, upon very good Evidence given them as to Facts, convicted Edom, and brought him in Guilty.</p>
            <p>He has behaved in a very quiet Manner since, and appeared to be sensible of what he had done; acknowledged the Justice of his Sentence, but it was some Time before he could quit his Hold of a Hope he had entertained of saving his Life. But when he found all Hope was lost, the Emotions of his Breast, arising from the different Motives of Hope and Fear, began to give Way to the Appearance of his approaching Fate, and he was resigned to the Will of God, hoping to change this Life for a better.</p>
