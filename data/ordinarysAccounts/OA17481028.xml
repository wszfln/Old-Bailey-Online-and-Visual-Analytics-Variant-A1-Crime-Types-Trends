They were very intimate, and acquitted that Sessions together. Lancasterwent Home to his Friends, the Appearance of the Court having for the present struck such a Terror into him, that he thought never to run the Risk again of being brought before it: But, it is generally observed, that once entered on these wicked Courses, they seldom leave till Justice overtakes them; and he had not been long at Liberty, but he and two more set out on an Expedition, intending to rob every one they met: And in June last, two Miles on this Side Rumford, they met a Gentleman on Horseback, whom they beset, and robbed of a Metal Watch, and some Money, and sold the Watch for 1 l. 2 s.</p>

Thus their Acquaintance renewed again, and as they were going together towards Bartholomew Fair, they met a Boy that had stolen a Half-pint Silver Mug. The Boy, knowing them to be of the Trade, tells them what he had got, and as he was too far off from where he used to sell his Prizes, advised with them about it. They were then near Duke's Place (a great Receptacle of stolen Goods) where Lancaster and L - used to deal. The Few they applied to would not buy it then; the only Reason given, was, there were too many together, and he was afraid of Discovery. Then they went to another Jew, one

While they were there, Lancaster says, that L - could not forget his old Tricks, but opened a little Door of a Closet, and stole a Holland Apron, a Napkin, and a scarlet Cloak. Lancaster seeing him, busy in the Closet, asked him, What he did there, and what he was about? They might have taken more Things, but Lancaster, afraid of being discovered, thought it the best Way to march off with what they had, paid the Landlord for the Pint of Beer they drank, and went away with Design to sell the Mug the Boy had brought them.</p>

They asked him a Guinea, but he replied, it was not worth Half a Guinea: So at that Time they did not agree, but came down Stairs, and found the Boy at the Door waiting for their Return. For the present they agreed to go and make away with the Things they had stolen at the Ale-house, which they sold for Half a Crown; L - gave Lancaster and the Boy 8 d. apiece, and kept the rest himself.
