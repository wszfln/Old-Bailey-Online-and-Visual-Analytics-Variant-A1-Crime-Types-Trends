            <p>While under Sentence, they were all very seriously exhorted to think upon their latter End, as they were in a short time to appear before the great God of Heaven and Earth,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174201130004"/>
            <p>who, as he is infinitely merciful to forgive the Sins of all true Penitents, so as a just God, he will render unto every one according to their Actions done in this World, whether good or bad, to them who by patient continuing in well-doing, wait for Glory and Honour and Immortality, he will hereafter grant eternal Life; but to the wicked and disobedient, who know not God, nor observe his Ways, he will pour forth his Wrath, even Fire and Brimstone. This will be the Portion of all unpenitent hardened Sinners, therefore they were seriously admonished, if they had any Regard for the eternal Welfare of their precious Souls, to repent unfeignedly of all their Sins, especially those very great ones for which they were now to suffer. And as the Apostle advises, to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and they should be saved; they were pathetically told how sinful, and how much it was against the positive Commands of Almighty God, to rob, to steal and pilfer from our Neighbour's; nay, that it was a breaking God's Commands, even to covet our Neighbour's Goods, much more was it so, to violently force them away; they were likewise reminded of their baptismal Vow, to remember how they had promised to deny all Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present World, and how little they had regarded that promise, by their committing such Irregularities.</p>
            <p>They were likewise instructed in the Nature of the Sacrament of our Lord's last Supper, and were taught, that by devoutly and worthily partaking thereof, with a sincere and hearty Repentance of their past sinful Lives, they would renew their baptismal Vows, become as new Creatures, and be entitled to the Grace and Mercy of an all-merciful, almighty God, who is ever ready to extend his Mercy to a truly penitent Sinner.</p>

He owned that he had been a wicked Youth, and that he most deservedly suffered for the Crimes he had committed.

They were afterwards taken up, and Watson confessed she took the Watch and gave it to Dogget, who was to have 5 s. for pawning it. She owned herself a most notorious young Whore, plying in the Streets every Night, and that her common Practice was to pick Gentlemen's Pockets of Watches, Money, or what she could find, and succeeding so well as she had done, she determined to follow the same Practice, which she did till the Commission of the above Fact, which brought her to her End. She cried most bitterly, and made most solemn Vows if her Life was spar'd to become a new Creature, and was vastly afraid to die. She pretended to have been married, but afterwards owned she never was, but that she was a polluted, unclean, unwornthy Creature from her Childhood; the Day before her Execution she came to me, and with a Flood of Tears owned she had been a vile Sinner, and that her Conscience was greatly troubled for her Disobedience to her poor Mother, (who came frequently to visit her) I gave her such spiritual Comfort the Gospel affords, and instructed her in the Nature of the Sacrament she was to receive. She hoped for Salvation through the Mercy of God in Christ, sincerely repented of a most flagitious Life, and died in Peace with all the World.</p>

            <p>Here I continued for three Years, and then frequently used to absent myself from School, and lye about Inn Yards, and ride the Horses there.</p>
            <p>This I may say was my first Step towards the untimely Death I must now suffer, for at one of these Places I got acquainted with <persName id="OA17420113n87-1">

            <p>For two Years I pursued this Course of Life, before it came to my Father's Knowledge, and when he heard of it he kept me closely confined, and bound me Apprentice to himself. He then followed the <rs id="OA17420113-occupation-45" type="occupation">Waterman's Business</rs>

I being of a roving Disposition, could not bear the Thoughts of such Confinement, therefore was determined at all Events to make an Elopement.</p>
            <p>In pursuance of this Resolution, I one Day got out of Window of the Room where I was lock'd up, by the help of a Sheet, and made the best of my Way to <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-65">

Which I go as easy to Execution, as if I was going to suck at my Mother's Breast; and I think it is doing a great deal of Good to hang me out of the Way.</p>

            <p>MY Life being justly forfeited by my Offences, wilful and repeted Breaches of the Laws, both of God and Man, it becomes me to do all that is in the Power of such an unhappy Wretch as I am, to render my Punishment serviceable to my Country, by exhorting those (especially my Brother, who was an Evidence against me) who have already set their Feet in the Paths of Folly and Destruction; to turn back in Time, before the Judgment of the Law shall overtake them, and to awaken such young Persons as may be misled into a Belief that there is something Pleasant and entertaining in a Life of Plunder and Iniquity, out of their fatal Mistakes, because 'tis but too evident, that those who once engage in such evil Ways, are seldom, if ever reclaimed.</p>
            <p>Those, who in the Course of an inconsiderate and mispent Life, I have wrong'd, either by Word or Deed, will I hope, rest satisfied with that just Punishment, the Law hath adjudged me to, and which I shall have suffer'd before this comes to their Hands, and not load my Memory with Reproach, or transfer the Remembrance of my Guilt to those Friends that survive me, who (in Equity) ought not to suffer in their Character for my Crimes, though they have in their Fortune for my Extravagance and Folly. The Charity of Mankind in forgiving me, will redound to their own Praise and Tranquility; and as to those Persons who have injured me upon any Account whatever, I sincerely and unfeignedly forgive them.</p>
            <p>The abundant Mercy of God, through the infinite Mercy of Christ my Redeemer, alight on my departing Soul, and purge it from all Stains of Sin and Pollution, before I appear in the Presence of my Creator. Amen.</p>
            <p>The subsequent Account discovers such a Scene of Iniquity, as must be highly beneficial to the Publick, especially on two Accounts; one that it must render such Arts as this unhappy young Man and his Accomplices practised, less successful for the future; the other, that it will effectually fright young People from Billiard-Tables, and such Places, were, first they are drawn into Necessities, and then into wicked Practices to supply them.</p>

            <p>The first beginning of his Misfortunes, was frequently going to the Billiard-Tables; he had learned to Play so well, that he was what they call a Tip top Player! it was at one of these Places he became acquainted with one Carr (who was concerned with him in forging Mr. Hoar's Notes, and who died in Newgate sometime ago) whose Talent at that Game being as good as his, they used very often to play as Strangers for very large Sums; but it was under a Pretence that Gentlemen should lay with the By-standers, which is performed thus: Two Persons go to a noted Billiard Table, and pretend to challenge one another to play; whilst they are at Play, two or three others, seemingly Strangers, likewise make their Entrance, who are Confederates with the former; while they are at play, these Confederates pitch upon either of the Players, and offers to lay a Sum of Money he wins the Game, which Sum is a small one, not exceeding half a Guinea; if any Body lays with them, he that lays is sure to have the best of it, 'till the Game is almost out, then the other Accomplices offer either to lay or take the Odds, which when they</p>

            <p>have done, the Players, who, as was observed before, Play what they call Booty, know how to Manage, whether to win or loose, so very often endeavouring to make it appear, not deceiving to the By-standers, they loose themselves three or four Guineas, when perhaps their Accomplices win 30 or 40 l. By these Stratagems, Ramsey has had often for his Share 20 l. a Night. But he used to be as unfortunate at Hazard, as he was lucky in playing Booty (as they term it) at Billiards, for the Hazard - Table generally stripp'd him.</p>
            <p>It was one Night that he and Carr had lost a considerable Sum of Money, and they were put to their Wits-end how to get more; but Carr who was of a fruitful Invention, soon thought of the following Stratagem. Himself belonging to the Playhouse, could have any Dress from thence he thought proper; and dressing himself as a Harlequin, and Ramsey as a Spaniard, they immediately repair'd to their Lodgings, where taking a Quantity of Half-pence, which they before had got ready for the Purpose, they made three Parcels, and about forty Half-pence in each Parcel, which they sealed up with an Earl's Coat of Arms. As soon as this was done, they ordered a Servant to call a couple of Chairs, and directed the Chairmen to carry them both (there being a Masquerade that Night) to <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-136">

As soon as they arrived there, they diverted themselves with some little Tricks and Conversation amongst the People of Quality, 'till part of the Company settled themselves to play at Hazard in one of the Rooms, to which Place they soon retired amongst the rest, and seated themselves, where Ramsey placing upon the Table his three Rows of Half-pence, sealed with an Earl's Coat of Arms; he was not long settled before the Box came round, and it was his Turn to throw, and fixing his Eye round the Table, found there was set about 50 l. which Sum he knocked at, and throwing out, he said, Double or Quit, Gentlemen, which they presently complied with, and then throw'd again, and flung out; and said, Double or Quit again, they all answered Yes, but poor Ramsey's ill Fortune would not let him winn, for he once more flung out, and having the Box, was going to throw once more; when one of the Gentlemen cried, please to pay, Sir! Ay, Sir! so taking his three Parcel of Half-pence, he push'd them towards the Gentleman, and said, Sir, there is what I have lost, please to take yours, and pay the rest of the Gentlemen, and immediately getting up in a very great Passion, Swore he would play no more that Night, and push'd off with great Precipitation. The Gentleman opening the Paper, and seeing nothing but Half-pence, called out to the Waiters to stop him; but he had taken Care to get out of their reach.</p>
            <p>This Stratagem having not succeeded according to Expectation, made him go Home with a heavy Heart, and the next Day, he and Carr being at a Loss for want of Money, they had recourse to the following Stratagem; there was that Night a Play acted, call'd, the Spanish Fryar, in <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-138">

            <p>following Manner, viz. Carr dressed himself in a very rich Livery, and Ramsey, as a young Gentleman of Fortune, who took the Title of a Baronet, (which first gave Rise of his being called <persName id="OA17420113n142-1">

                  <interp inst="OA17420113n142-1" type="given" value="ROBERT"/>Sir Robert Ramsey</persName>) and to make the Matter less suspected, he used to carry a young Lady of the Town with him, which he pick'd up by the Way, to a Tavern, where Sir Robert's Servant coming in some time afterwards to enquire if Sir - such a one, Baronet was not there, who had before taken Care to leave his Name at the Bar. As soon as the Drawer had answered, and introduced to the pretended Baronet, the Baronet ordered him to wait 'till he had supped, and likewise to go into the Kitchen. Whilst his pretended Footman Carr was there, he used to employ his Time in drinking pretty freely of his Master's Bounty (for he had Orders to drink what he pleased) and amuse the Drawers, Cook, &amp;c. with a long Story of his Master the Baronet's Generosity, and likewise of his honourable Family and worthy Ancestors. Whilst these Things were in Agitation, he used now and then to slip a Silver Spoon, or what lay nearest to him, in his Pocket; this done, he immediately called the Drawer, and desired to know if his Master did not want him, at the same Time looking at the Clock, and desiring the Drawer to tell his Master it was such an Hour, naming the Hour, which was the Signal agreed on, between the Baronet and his Footman, that when he had got any Moveables, he might immediately go out and Plant it. The Drawer presently used to bring Word, that the Baronet desired his Servant to go to my Lord - such a one's immediately, and bring an Answer as soon as possible; so Carr used to slip out, and Plant the Moveable, and then return in a certain Space of Time. By these Means, his Footman Carr and Ramsey bilked several Taverns in this City, and made off with what they could, which they always took Care should not be found upon them, if they were suspected, which very seldom happened; for this Reason, they always chose those Places where much Company used to Resort, and if they could not go handsomely off, they always paid the Reckoning. The first Fact they did of this Nature, was at a certain Tavern in <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-139">

            <p>But to return to our Baronet; that he got so much after this Manner, that he always used to appear in black Velvet, with a good Watch in his Pocket, and a Diamond Ring on his Finger, and being a Person well educated, and had other Accomplishments, he and his Man passed on very successfully in this Practice for upwards of two Years.</p>
            <p>But Ramsey and his Man Carr's bad Success at the Hazard-Table (for there they both used to resort) soon verified the old English Proverb, That ill-gotten Goods never thrive, for Ramsey was generally stripp'd. They were so very cautious of being known in the Day-time, that generally Ramsey used to be dressed as a Servant, and his pretended Footman Carr, as a Gentleman. It was at one of these Taverns which they bilk'd, that they imposed on a Clergyman in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>The Parson used to use a certain Coffee-house where Ramsey frequented, and Carr likewise. When the Mask was flung off, and he dressed as a Gentleman: They taking great Notice of this Clergyman, and he of them, they used often to get into Disputes in Conversation, and Ramsey and Carr maintaining their Point pretty well, they were both much admired by the Hearers; by this Means, often meeting at this Coffee-house they always used to bow to the Parson very respectively, and he to them. One Day, Money being at that Time pretty low with them both, Ramsey addressed himself to the Parson as follows. " Sir, says he, (Carr then not being present) " I have an Affair of the greatest Importance to communicate to you, and I do not " doubt if you can't serve me, that you are a " Person of so much Honour, that you will keep " what I have to say as a very great Secret."* This was the Person that swore he was Mac Creigh's Surgeon, at the Time of his Trial at Kingston. Gaffney was Execnted at <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-141">Tyburn</placeName>, on Monday the 22d of September, 1735.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174201130020"/>
            <p>The Parson assured him he would. Then Sir, resumes Ramsey, " My Friend, whom you have " often seen with me, is very much smitten with, " and well received by a young Widow Lady " of a very great Fortune, but their Friends " are so averse to the Match, that they watch " all Opportunities to frustrate their Hopes, and " have actually disappointed them both several " Times of being married. Now, my Friend " is really so much in Love, that I believe he'll " in a short Time run distracted, if he does not " Possess the Widow. Here Sir, lies the Difficulty, she abhors the Name of being married " at the Fleet, and as I observed before, their " Friends are so vigilant, that they disappoint " them in doing it in any other Shape." Sir, answers the Parson, I'll try if I can stand your Friend. Sir, says Ramsey, if you can, I'll engage the Sum of twenty Pieces for a Pair of Gloves. The Parson semed pleas'd at such a Sum, promised he might command him to do as he pleased, and moreover added, the sooner this Thing is done, the better. Ah! says Ramsey a little more cool, finding the Parson inclineable. There is still a small difficulty, which is this, that it must be done as private as possible, and in order to do it, he desired the Parson would meet him at such a Tavern, naming a Tavern near the Royal Exchange the next Day, at such an Hour, and in the mean Time he would acquaint his Friend with the Parson's Friendship, which he did not doubt his Friend would be over-joyed to hear. Immediately Ramsey posted from the Parson to Carr, and informed him of the Success, they consulted together, and proceeded thus.</p>
            <p>The next Day, which was the Day the Parson was to meet Ramsey and his Friend. Ramsey goes to his Lodgings, and tells the Parson that it was necessary that there should be a Footman in the Case, and his Friend's Footman being known, he had agreed to personate one, in order to accomplish their Design the better, and he thought proper to call, that the Parson might not do any Thing to frustrate their Design through a Mistake; and likewise, Ramsey did this, that he might see the Posture of his Lodgings, and what Things might be made there. And while Ramsey was there, the Landlady, who was a Woman of Worth, came up Stairs, and seeing Ramsey with the Parson, was going to retreat; but he desired her with much Ceremony, not to go, for he had no great Business with the Parson, only there was an innocent Frolick in Agitation, and that in all Probability, she might see him by and by disguised as a Footman, and at the same Time gave the Parson the Wink, - by this means he deceived them both as will appear.</p>
            <p>Shortly after some trivial Discourse being over, Ramsey very respectively took his Leave of the Parson, and told him he wou'd wait of him shortly in his proper Dress, which he did; and being equipped as a Footman, told the Parson, that it was necessary that they should both go together in a Hackney-Coach, he within, and the other behind; immediately they both posted away in a Hack. When they came there, Ramsey got down and opened the Door, and let the Parson out very respectfully; and there being the best Room before bespoke, the Parson was conducted in with much Ceremony. As soon as he was seated, Ramsey who had before played his Part, ordered that the Doctor might have a Bottle of Frontiniac, which was the Wine he loved by his Master's Order: When this was carried in, the Parson having no Company, desired</p>

            <p>THE ORDINARY of NEWGATE, His ACCOUNT of the Behaviour, Confession, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE Drawer to send up the Gentleman's Servant, which he did, and was what Ramsey wanted, to prepare the Parson for his Purpose. The Parson drinking pretty freely of the Wine, in some time fell asleep; Ramsey was not idle upon this Occasion, for as soon as the Parson was past the Sense of feeling, Ramsey picked his Pocket of his Keys. The Parson, after he had slept about an Hour, awoke, and looking at his Watch, found that it was nigh eleven o'Clock, and that being the Hour appointed, told Ramsey, he wondered his Friend did not come: Ramsey said, he would step and see the Reason, and immediately went to the Parson's Landlady, and telling her the Parson had sent him for something in his Cabinet, and as a Token, he had brought the Keys. The Landlady showed him up Stairs, and as soon as he was by himself, he pillaged the Room of 100 l. which he found in a Cabinet, besides a Diamond Ring worth 20 l. and looking over some Papers, found them of such Importance, as that the carrying them off might prevent a Prosecution in case of Discovery. These therefore he clapped in his Pocket, and was so dextrous and nimble about his Business, that he returned to the Parson in less than an Hour, who understanding that there was Orders for every Thing he had a Mind too, had by Ramsey's Return, got a good Dinner upon the Table. Ramsey, as soon as he entered the Room where the Parson was, told him his Friend would be there in a few Minutes, and in the mean Time if any Thing came, to take it in, and he would step a little Way, and return presently.</p>
            <p>No sooner was Ramsey gone, but up comes a Jeweller, who brought with him a plain Gold Ring, and a Diamond one, worth 30 Guineas, which Jeweller was sent by Ramsey in his Footman's Habit, who had ordered him to carry the Rings to such a Place, where was a Gentleman waiting, naming the Place where the Parson was staying for the Baronet, or Gentleman as he then passed for; now Sir Robert had sometime before, bespoke these Rings of this Jeweller; as soon as the Jeweller entered the Room, the Parson, who before had been prepared by Ramsey, accosted him in the following Manner: Come Sir, says he, please to drink to the Bride and Bridegroom's Health; Ay, withal my Heart, says the Jeweller, I don't know what sort of a Lady she may be, but I am sure he is a good natur'd civil Gentleman; upon this, the Jeweller pulled out his two Rings. Ramsey, who was already return'd, lissen'd at the Door, and as soon as the Jeweller had pro</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174201130023"/>
            <p>duced the Rings, opens the Door, and steps into the Room, and tell Mr. B - d the Jeweller, that he was wanted at Home immediately, by a Gentleman in a Coach; but Sir, added he, I would not have you stay, for my Master will be here presently; the Jeweller, who had just before put the Rings in the Parson's Hands, took his Leave with much Complaisance, and hoped when the Gentleman came, if he was not returned by that Time, that the Parson would excuse him, and if he could, he would dispatch the Gentleman, and be back again as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>The Jeweller was no sooner gone, but Ramsey taking the Diamond Ring out of the Parson's Hands, and pretending to look at it, seemed to be in a sort of a Surprize, Lord Sir! (says he) to the Parson, he has not had the two first Letters of my Friend's Name engrav'd on the Ring according to Orders; I'll step immediately back to him and get it done. This is a Mistake indeed cries the Parson; away posts Ramsey, and leaves the plain Gold Ring behind him. The Jeweller had no sooner got Home, and found there was no Body there a waiting for him, he presently begun to smell a Rat, and hurrying away to the Tavern, enquired if the Parson was gone, and was answered by the Drawer, No. Upon which, blessing his good Fortune as he thought, desired the Drawer to go and fetch a Constable immediately; whilst the Drawer was obeying his Orders, he runs up Stairs, and the Parson being fast asleep, as soon as the Jeweller found this, O ho! Mr. Gentleman have I catched you, but I'll swinge you, or make you pay for my Rings; with these Words the Parson awoke, and rubbing his Eyes, asked what was the Matter? By this Time the Drawer returned with a Constable, who coming in, the Jeweller charged the Parson with defrauding him of two Rings; I defraud you Sir! says the Parson, I believe you are mad; What do you mean? I'll tell you presently; come bring him along before the next Magistrate, and then he shall see what I mean. Away they all marched to the next Justice; where being come, the Jeweller charged the Parson with defrauding him of two Rings, and told a long Story how he had them bespoke some Days before, by one who he believed to be the Parson's Accomplice. The Jeweller's Story in short seem'd so plain, that all the Parson said in his Defence, seemed to make the Matter more plain against himself, till at last the Justice was going to commit him; but he sending for some Gentlemen of undoubted Character and Reputation, they passed their Word it was an Imposition on the Parson, as well as the Jeweller; and likewise gave a sufficient Security for his Behaviour, so he was discharged. But when he came Home, and found all his Money gone, and Papers and Ris besides, he was ready to run distracted; the Jeweller who had a covetous Wife, was almost mad at his Loss, he met with a most gracious Reception.</p>
            <p>This last Adventure lined their Pockets pretty well, and it being Summer Season, they went into the Country, and staid there till they had nigh consumed their Money, which being almost gone, they returned to London, and pursued their old Adventures. They had great Success in all their Adventures of this Nature, till one Evening going to the <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-146">

            <p>broad, that would infallible cure the GOVT. This Distemper his Landlord being much troubled with, presently gave much Ear to, and Ramsey who never wanted for Address, so persuaded this Man, who was very hipp'd, that this Preparation would do him great Service; So in short, the Man believing himself to be much better by this excellent Preparation as Ramsey called it; gave out that he was cured of the GOVT by Dr. Johnson, (for so Ramsey called himself) and the Thing having a very great Effect amongst the common sort of People.</p>
            <p>Dr. Johnson publish'd printed Bills all over the City, and offered likewise Advice in all Distempers Gratis, Tuesdays and Wednesdays for the Men, and Thursdays and Fridays for the Women; by this Means he being dressed in an old rusty Suit of Cloaths, and his Eye Brows black'd, he gained much Esteem by his pretended Gravity, and Money came in a-pace. Amongst the rest of Ramsey's Patients who came to him for Advice, there was a young Lady that was troubled with an Asthma; this Lady coming backwards and forwards pretty much for Dr. Johnson's Advice, he took a great liking to her, imagining you must think, that she had a good Fortune, which upon the Doctor's Enquiry she had, for she was worth 1000 l. all in her own Hands. The next Step was to break his Passion to her, which he took an Opportunity to do, when she came to him one Day, in the following manner.</p>
            <p>" Madam, says he, I find by your Symptoms " you are much better, (but added he with a very " great Sigh) I am much worse since my administring my Remedies to you; for I am in short " possessed with such Ideas, sleeping and waking, that unless you permit me the Pleasure of " dying at your Feet, I shall pine away, and " in a short Time despair." The young Lady who had not been used to such Expressions, began to look very earnestly at the Doctor, and said, Sir! I can't tell what you mean by these Expressions. Why Madam, says he, at the same Time catching hold of one of her Hands; permit me but to wait on you, and I hope Time will convince you, that my Meaning is sincere. Ramsey said abundance of Things of this Nature, and being a Person (as was observed before) very skilful in this Sort of Address, that in some short Time he gain'd the young Ladies Consent to visit her, in the Quality of a Suitor. Flush'd with this Success, he went on for some Days, and had certainly succeeded, (if an Uncle of the young Lady's, who had best Part of her Fortune in his Hands, and who paid her Interest for it) had not come to Town in the Interim.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman coming to <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-157">

Dr. Johnson finding the old Gentleman very solicitous to enquire concerning his Family and Circumstances, pretended to write to <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-158">
                  <interp inst="OA17420113-geo-158" type="type" value="region"/>

            <p>Now Ramsey was in Hopes he should gain the young Ladies Consent before it was Time for the Answers returned, he redoubled his Courtship in private to her, hoping as he said, she was satisfied to this. She answer'd with a Sigh! she was very well satisfied, for it was impossible a Gentleman of his Education and Appearance, should be an IMPOSTOR. But still she was uneasy, left her Uncle should know, and begg'd him to defer it some small Time longer; besides, it would be a difficulty she said, if he should find it out, to get her Effects out of his Hands.</p>
            <p>With these Answers Ramsey seemed to be satisfied, but still was in Hopes that she would consent privately. Whilst these Things were in Agitation, Ramsey one Day taking a Walk upon the Walls of the City, and who should he espy some Distance from him, but the Parson whom he had defrauded of his Money, Ring and Papers some Time before. This you must be sure put him in a very great Consternation, for he was so confounded that he scarce knew what to do; but at last recovering himself, he retreated to his Lodging with great Precipitation, and considering with himself that this was no Place for his longer Continuance, he therefore resolved he would not go off empty handed; but which was the Way to fly was his next Consideration, so at last he resolved to go for <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-159">

            <p>turning, brought Word that was one expected to go off that Night. He immediately went to the young Lady's Lodgings, and after drinking some Tea, she left him some small Time in her Appartment by himself, and with his Spatula and Probe, picked open a Lock of her Bureau; when he had so done, he found a Bag, in which was contained fourscore Pound, and by the Side of it lay a Diamond Ring, which he took, and about fifty Pounds out of the Bag. After he had done this, he shut and lock'd the Bureau, the young Lady returning, he told her that he should be glad if she would honour him with her Company that Evening at his Appartment, to play a Game at Cards, which she consentented to, and away they both went towards Dr. Johnson's Lodging.</p>
            <p>As soon as she arrived there, and being seated about an Hour, Ramsey pretended to go down Stairs, and returned in a very great Hurry. Madam, says he, your Uncle's come to pay me a Visit, do you chuse to be seen by him? (now he knew very well before-hand, that she did not care her Uncle should see her at his Lodging, by Reason she had told the Doctor that her Uncle had ordered her to pay him no more Visits, till the Answers came to his Letters) Upon which she was going to hide herself in the Closet. Hold! Hold! Madam, says Ramsey, you need not hide yourself, the old Gentleman's below in deep Discourse with my Landlord; now if you please to continue where you are, and divert yourself about an Hour, or in what Time I can dispatch the old Gentleman, I'll go and persuade him to drink a Glass of Wine with me, and if you chuse to Read, here's a Book to divert you, at the same Time presenting her with Pomfret's Poems, to this she readily consented, so the Doctor was going, but on a Sudden returning said, I believe Madam I had as good lock the Door for fear he should come up before he goes, and then I'll pretend I can't find the Key; so he lock'd her in.</p>
            <p>Now this was a Stratagem of Ramsey's, that she should not go Home and miss her Money and Ring. He lost no Time, but made the best of his Way to Park-Gate, and as soon as he arriv'd there, the Vessel was going off, which gave him but just Time to write the following LETTER.</p>
            <p>DEAR MADAM,</p>

As for the Trifle I borrow'd of you, I hope you will excuse, as knowing it was in my Power to have taken all if I wold; but you see there is still some Conscience left amongst us Doctors; the Ring I intend to keep for your Sake, without the HAZARD-TABLE disappoints me. If ever Fortune puts it in my Power, I will make a Return, and 'till then, accept of this Advice, never let a strange Doctor possess yor Affections no more. I had almost forgot, I ask Pardon for making you my Prisoner, but I doubt not, old Starch-Face, your Uncle, would detain me a little longer than I have you, if he could catch me: Adieu!</p>

            <p>As for the more illiterate sort, he was much esteem'd by, and they thought him for his Age the greatest Person they ever saw or heard off; but Money did not come in fast enough this Way, for our Astrologer kept such a good House, and feasted his Friends so magnificently, that at last could scarce make both Ends meet; so after he had continued here some Months he was resolv'd to get off, but could not with a safe Conscience go empty handed; the two Months being near expir'd, in which his Treatise was to appear, he had Recourse to the following Stratagem; he first of all gets an old Beggar's Disguise, and a long Beard, which Disguise he kept by him to be ready against the first Opportunity, and going to a Person who lent Money upon Pawns, desiring him to let him have a certain quantity of Money upon his Furniture, 30 l. which the other consented to, telling him withal, that this Money was to purchase a certain Machine which he had then bespoke, telling him likewise that he would make a Return in a few Days, but withal desir'd the Pawnbroker to be Secret; saying, that he would not have such a Thing known for the whole World; the other told him that he might depend on his Secrecy.</p>
            <p>About this Time came thither from Holland a Person that was reckon'd to be a very famous Man, and Dr. DYCHE gave out, that he wou'd dispute with this Man upon any one Point that he should propose; the other hearing of this sent him Word, to chuse his Subject; whereupon our Astrologer sent him an Answer, that he would enter into an Enquiry, Whether Sir <persName id="OA17420113n186-99">

He was inclinable he said to think the contrary, desiring his Antagonist to be ready against such a Day, in order to defend that Point. The other thinking he had the right Side of the Question, sent Answer he would be ready for him against the Day appointed.</p>
            <p>Now they had at that Time agreed on a certain Place where the Dispute was to be, and likewise to print a certain Number of Tickets at 2 s. 6 d. each, to be deliver'd to such Persons as should chuse to come to hear this Dispute. Now each was to put off as many as he could; Ramsey three Days before the appointed Time put off upwards of 400 among his Acquaintance, and finding he could put off no more, he thought it high Time to retreat, judging he could not trust with Safety to his Disguise if he stay'd.</p>
            <p>The Noise of this Dispute ran all over the Town, and abundance of People were big in their Expectations to hear this learned Dispute. Our Astrologer and Chymist kept himself after he had disposed of his Tickets very retire, and all Company that came, he pretended he could not see, on account of his deep Study, in order to prepare himself for the Dispute; the appointed Day came, and Ramsey as was observ'd before, had taken Care to prepare himself for the Day, and disguising himself like an old Beggar, putting an large Patch upon one Eye, and a counterfeit Beard on, and daub'd his Hands all over with Walnut-tree Liquor; in this Dress he was so disguised, that he was pretty sure no body would know him, with an old Bag at his Back, in which was contained his Cloaths and Linnen, he set out to see the Issue of his Adventures.</p>
            <p>For his farther Security he had some Days before enquired, and heard that there was a Liver</p>

            <p>pool Ship that had brought Goods from thence to Drogheda, which was expected to depart very soon.</p>
            <p>But to return, when he had thus disguised himself, and the Time of the Evening drawing on, he went to an obscure Part of the City, to a House where several Beggars were a drinking, and preparing to go to the Place where this Dispute was to be, in order to ask Charity; accordingly he mix'd himself in their Company, and having a particular Knack of counterfeiting, he was observed by them, thinking him to be one of them; as soon as they all arrived to this Place, the People was flocking in a-pace to hear the Dispute, when the House was full, and the Time expired, the Company began to look round and saw the other Disputer ready enter'd to engage his Antagonist; but waiting some Time with Impatience, and finding no Opponant, began to be more uneasy; at last some of the Company proposed to send to the Doctor's House, to know the Reason, which they did, and the Messenger returning, inform'd them he had knock'd at the Doctor's Door, and waited a good while, no body came, neither could they see any Light in the House, making likewise an Enquiry in the Neighbourhood, but none of the Neighbours was able to give him a satisfactory Answer; this put them in a great Consternation, not knowing what to think; when they had waited about an House, finding themselves disappointed, began to think of departing; first one came out, and then another said, I judg'd what this Dispute would come to; and a third said, if we could but find the Dog, he shall be made an Example of; and the fourth came out scratching his Ears.</p>
            <p>At last, one of the Company said, it was a Combination between 'em both, and proposed to go back and make the other Refund their Money, which several of the Company agreed to; and coming up to the other Doctor, asked him in a very surly Manner for their Money; but he making some Excuse, and not being very ready to make a return, they began to charge him with being a Confederate, and he not returning a satisfactory Answer, they were more Loud, and several of the rest of the Auditors being divided in their Opinions, began to quarrel with one another, and from Words, they fell to Blows, and in the Scufle, the poor Dutch Doctor was beaten almost to Pieces, and his Gown torn off his Back, so that when he came out, it very much diverted Ramsey, for he looked more like a Beggar than a Doctor.</p>
            <p>At last, the Company, after they had tired themselves with breaking one another's Heads, and tearing their Cloaths, came out, and as they passed along, swore what they would do, if they could catch Dr. DYCHE, as they supposed Ramsey to be.

Ramsey mentioned one whom Carr had been brought acquainted with some Days before, by the Means of one R - m, but Carr thought him not a sufficient Person, by reason he was not for himself, so they parted for that Time; in some few Days after, Carr and Ramsey meeting accidentally, and were contemplating on their Circumstances, which was, want of Money; who should come by, as they were talking in the Street, but the Attorney whom</p>

Carr told them, they could not be in too much Hurry in an Affair which was like to prove serviceable to them all; but the other reply'd, too much Hurry would ruin all; whereupon Words arising they quarrelled, and separated for that Time, agreeing to meet the next Day; but Carr meeting a Lady of Pleasure, he failed meeting according to Appoint</p>

Pat - son then asked, why Ramsey could not receive it. Carr told him Mr. Hoare's People knew Ramsey, and if he should go, and the Money shall be stopp'd, then it would be discovered, and inevitably Ruin the young Lady: And likewise told him, if he'd go and receive it, the Money would soon be made up by the Lady, and she had contrived so, that her Father would never find out the Deceit, and if he would agree to go, Carr would lend him 5 l. and likewise pay the Debt his Father was Arrested for; by the Persuasion, Pat - son agreed to go. Ramsey and Pat - son lay together that Night, and on the Monday Morning early, Pat - son was to go with the Note; accordingly Pat - son took the Note of Carr, and went with it; Carr and Ramsey went to <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-187">

They push'd the Bottle pretty briskly about, and being very merry, consulted how they should live in a strange Place; at last, be thought themselves of the following Stratagem.</p>
            <p>There was at that Time, in the Town, Parson W - ley, who was a great Methodist, and likewise a great Friend to those who followed him, and was sincere in his Way of Thinking. Accordingly they agreed to wait on the Parson next Day at his Lodgings, and telling him a very dismal Story of their forsaking all their Friends and the little they had in view at London, they came down to Bristol, purely for Conscience Sake, in order to hear his Doctrine, and to enjoy their Religion quietly, which they could not do at London, they was so much persecuted by their Friends, and esteemed by their Acquaintance as Mad-men. The Parson embraced them with a great deal of Tenderness, asked them several Questions, to which they had their Answers readily; and told them, that he was glad to find they had such good Notions of Religion, and that he would do them all the Service that lay in his Power, in order to their becoming Christians in reality, which till then he told them, they only profess'd the Name, but not the Meaning. This done, they all three went to Prayers, and the Parson made them a Present of a little Book, call'd, The Life of God, in the Soul of Man; telling them to peruse it carefully, it containing very necessary Instructions concerning their future Happiness; and farther, that if they pleased, they might after one Months Trial, be admitted as one of their Brethren, and belong to their SOCIETY.</p>
            <p>The following is the Manner in which they were admitted; they was brought before the whole Society, which was then kept in Ballance-street; and after shewn to all the Brethren, who commonly meet once a Week, they was desired to meet twice, 'till their Month was compleated, with one or more of the Society, who are old Standers, and are called Leaders of Bands. They went according to one of these Bands, who met with some Members, and where asked the following Questions by their Leaders.</p>
            <p>Are you in Love?</p>
            <p>Are you married?</p>
            <p>Have you received Remission of Sins?</p>
            <p>Does the spirit of Self bear Witness with your Spirit, that you are born of God?</p>
            <p>Do you desire to become as a little Child?</p>
            <p>Do you desire to keep any Thing? Is your Sins a Secret?</p>
            <p>To which Questions they giving satisfactory Answers, were in a Month's Time admitted into the Society, as Members, which was done as follows.</p>

            <p>Still let thy Love point out his Way,</p>
            <p>What wondrous Works thy Love hath wrought;</p>
            <p>Sill lead him least he go astray,</p>
            <p>Direct his Work, inspire his Thought,</p>
            <p>And when he falls, soon may he hear</p>
            <p>Thy Voice, and know that Love is near.</p>
            <p>As soon as Ramsey had gone through his several Degrees, and was admitted in the Manner before mentioned; his next Step was to come at the Money, which they commonly keep by them in large Parcels, which was usually gathered every Evening at their public Societies and expounding Places. He took so much Care, with regard to his Behaviour, that he soon made the Parson think he was very sincere, so was introduced amongst the chief of the Methodist's, where he commonly took Care to enquire which of the Brethren had most Money, and was the most bigotted to their Principles; by this his artful Insinuation, and modest Behaviour, he soon gained much Esteem, and was look'd upon as a reputed Saint.</p>
            <p>Parson W - y lodging in High-street, at Mr. W - ld's Sisters, thither he often used to resort, at which Place all the Cash was kept for building two Houses, the one in Kingswood, the other in Town; he having free access to the Parson, used to pretend he had Qualms of Conscience which often troubled him; the Parson used to pray for his Deliverance; after praying some considerable Time, he was left to meditate by himself in the Room where the Money was kept; so whilst the Parson went down Stairs to pray with somebody else, he used to stuff his Pockets pretty full with Silver; by this means he had always Cash enough in his Pocket ready, if a Discovery was made of his Insincerity, to brush off with.</p>
            <p>He was always sure to frequent those public Places where there was often a gathering made, and likewise was ready to stand after the Prayers was over, in order to help gather the Money, which was often distributed very liberal; as soon as the People was all dispersed, he, Judas like, carried the Bagg, which he was sure to lighten very much before he got Home with it; he having plenty of Cash always, was sure to appear clean and neat every where wherever he went. At last, by these careful Methods, he insinuated himself into Parson Whit - d's Brother's Company, who was very fond of him, and he being a good Marksman, soon discovered the Parson's Brother's Infirmities, which ingratiated himself very much in his good Opinion. He used very often to have frequent Disputes with several of the Gentlemen and Clergymen of that Place, who often gave him Preference in Point of Learning, for he was a very good Scholar.</p>
            <p>But to return to Parson Whit - d's Brother, he was so linked in with him, that every Thing that Ramsey said was a Law; he soon discovering Thomas's blind Side (for that was the Parson's Brother's Name) he took greater Freedoms with him, and was less Cautious. One Adventure happening, occasioned the Town Talk, and was like to be the downfal of Ramsey. Snowd and Ramsey being very merry one Night over a Bottle, which was done by stealth, for nobody knew of it, it being reckoned a very heinous Crime to drink hard amongst those Sort of People; they in short got so much in Liquor, that they scarce knew each other, Ramsey left his Companion Snowd upon a Tomb Stone in <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-233">

Who is here? the sanctified Methodist, where's your Companion? Ramsey could scarce Answer, but at last belching and vomiting in her Face, he made Answer, he was safe a Bed; so he was sure enough, for he was so dead drunk, that he fell sound a sleep, as if he was in a down Bed; but he had not long enjoyed his Repose, before he was seen by some Gentlemen upon the Sneak, who strip'd him; when he awoke, he started up, and in that Condition, marched towards his Lodging about 5 o'Clock in the Morning; as soon as he came to the Door, he knock'd aloud and disturbed Ramsey, who remembring the last Nights Transactions, went down and let him in; this Affair had like to put an End to Ramsey's pretended Sanctity; but he putting a grave formal Face upon the Matter, soon reconcil'd Things, and was in as great Repute as ever.</p>

            <p>tune, seeing Ramsey one Day pull out a Purse of Gold, which he seemed to despise as Dross, the Orator, that is Parson Whit &#8211; d's Brother, desir'd Ramsey to lend him five Guineas, which he said should be return'd in a small Time; but Ramsey lov'd his Money too well to part with it in that Manner, made some frivilous Excuse, and told him he had promised to give it all to the Poor; which much nettled the Orator, who getting very merry that Evening, and meeting Ramsey at a Tavern playing at Hazard, with the same Purse of Money he had before show'd him; upon which he asked him, If that was given his Money to the Poor? Ramsey being confounded, answer'd him very civilly, withal desiring him to sit down and take Part of a Bottle, which the other refused, and went out immediately merry as he was to his Sister's, which was not far off, to whom he made a comical Story of Ramsey (who at that Time went by the Name of <persName id="OA17420113n234-2">

            <p>Ramsey suspecting the Orator was gone out to do him a Prejudice on account of his not lending him the Sum he requested, immediately follow'd him, and being pretty sober, and the other very merry, made his Assertion pretty good, so got off till the next Morning, for Whit - ld had, tho' much in Liquor, made the Case pretty plain against Ramsey: in the Morning they both appear'd before the Parson, but Ramsey had got the Tavern Man on his Side, who positively denied what they other had asserted, and so he got off for that Time; tho' the thinking Sort secretly thought he was guilty, and look'd more sharply after him, which Ramsey soon saw, and having got as much as he could, thought proper to retreat, before he was more found out. And while he was thinking of retreating, an Accident happen'd which prevented him for that Time, for Parson W - y being invited over to Bath to Preach according to his usual Custom, every Tuesday Fortnight, persuaded his Brother Ramsey to go along with him, who could not deny his Request for fear of any Suspicion with regard to the Money which he had purloined at Times from the common Stock, who accordingly went.</p>
            <p>When they arrived, W &#8211; y preach'd a Sermon on Predestination, and Ramsey officiated as Clerk, who in the middle of the Sermon, espying a Person who knew him, retreated with the utmost Expedition to an Inn at <placeName id="OA17420113-geo-234">

            <p>Ramsey in the Time of his Clerkship got acquainted with a Girl, who was formerly a Quaker, and who had lately turn'd Methodist, persuaded her that Money was but Dross, and she having 100 l. in her own Hands, that she could not be saved unless she gave it all to the Poor. The Girl eager with the Desire of becoming a good Christian, readily consented that Ramsey should dispose of all her Money as he thought proper, which he did you must be sure, and gave a very good Account how he had bestow'd it, which was as he told her distributed among the King's-wood Colliers.

Mr. B - w told them he should be glad to serve them with such Goods as was in his Power: they lost no Time, but employed a Carpenter to fit up their Shop, a Smith to do the Iron Work, and a Bricklayer to make a Sand-Heat, &amp;c. for an Apothecary and Surgeon; in the mean Time they was not idle, but contracted with all the Workmen they could to make all Things compleat.</p>
            <p>Whilst these Things was in Agitation, their next Step was to get what Goods they could in Credit, in order to convey a Way to make Money off; they sent for several Tradesmen to furnish the House in a genteel Manner; and in particular a Glass Man, whom they agreed with for Pots, Phials, &amp;c. Their next Contrivance was for some Goods, as Moveables, in order to raise Money. Their first Exploit of this Nature, was upon a Wine-Merchant, near Cannon-street, him Mr. Ramsey waited on, and told him that he had taken a large House in order to follow Business, more for Pleasure, than Profit, and that he should have much Company, usually kept large Quantities of several Sorts, but desired some as Samples for the present Use, which was sent immediately in by the Merchant. The next Thing Mr. Ramsey did, was to take Care to Order the Servant to distribute the Wine out Liberally, as he might be thought a Gentleman of great Generosity.</p>

The Sword-cutler after Drinking a Glass or two, and finding Mr. Ramsey did not return; and having Business to do, knock'd for the Servant, and asked what he would have him do; who told him that his Master to be sure would take it as a great Affront if he did not leave it; which the poor Man searing to disoblige his new Customer, presently complyed with, and he begg'd the Favour of the Servant that he would give his humble Respects to his Master, and begg his Pardon a Thousand Times, that he could not stay any longer at that Time, but would be sure to wait on him shortly; the Servant told him he would take Care to deliver the Message; but added, I would not have you come too soon, Sir, for fear my Master should think it is not in your Power to trust him, for he hates any thing Little, or Mean; the Sword-cutler thanking him for his good Advice, promis'd him he would not, so way he went.</p>
            <p>The next Day Mr. Ramsey waited on a Woollen-draper, and agreeing for a Quantity of Cloth, which came to upwards of 15 l. told the Gentleman he had not so much Money about him, but desired him to send it, and the Bill of Parcels to his House, and he would be at Home, naming a particular Time, and desiring the Woollen draper to be exact, he promised he would, and so they both parted with great Ceremonies; the Woollen-draper sent his Porter, and a Bill of Parcels punctual to the Time, and affixed under the Bill a Receipt. The Porter coming to Doctor Ramsey's House (you must understand he told the Woollen-draper he was a Doctor) and knocking at the Door, was presently let in, and asked if the Doctor was at Home: The Servant said his Master was that Minute sent for by Dr. C - den in order to be present at an Operation in cutting a Gentleman for the Stone; but (says he) Friend, if you have any Thing, you may leave it. Ay! says the Porter I'll leave it, but - But, What you Blockhead? if my Master was at Home, he'd kick you out of Doors for your Insolence,</p>

            <p>Oh, Dear Sir! (says the Porter to him) I hope you won't let the Doctor know, I only made a Scruple of leaving the Bill, which has got a Receipt; its very well, very well Friend, (says the Servant) I'll take no Notice now, but I wou'd advise you to take Care of your Behaviour for the future; so taking the Bill and the Cloth, the Porter went his Ways.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's Creditors (whom he had unfortunately taken in) coming to thick one after another to the Door, it was his Servant's whole Employment to dispatch them; for as yet they were ignorant of the Cause of his keeping so much out of the Way; at last the Storm growing pretty hot, the Servant thought proper to retreat, for fear a random Shot should hit him; so the House was left alone to answer for itself.</p>

            <p>Jan. 12. 1741.</p>
            <p>Dear Friend.</p>
            <p>THE important Concern about which we spoke together this Morning, is so deeply impressed upon my Mind, that I can't refrain writing to you a few Lines to remind you once more of the preciousness of that Redemption which the eternal Son of God had made for us, when he shed his Blood upon the Cross, which is indeed a weighty Matter, and which the Enemy of our Souls tries all possible Ways and Means to divert our Minds from meditating upon, especially when we are upon the Brink of Eternity; even our worldly Friends and Relations are oftentimes his Instruments, and by their own Fondness and Affection, quench and stifle those Convictions, and that Grace which our dear Saviour is never wanting to bestow upon the Purchase of his Blood, even our precious Souls; especially at such mementous Conjunctures.</p>
            <p>The Way of Salvation is indeed a short an easy way, as the Apostles mention'd to the Jailor and our Saviour has often declared himself, but I doubt not of your being fully convinced of this, that it is not a national Faith, or a meer Saying, I believe, that will save us, but must be the Faith, which is the Gift of us, but must be the Faith which is the Gift of GOD, and wrought by the Inspiration of the</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174201130039"/>
            <p>holy Spirit. O! my Friend, cry unto the Lord, and that instantly, that he may bestow this precious Gift upon you, before these few Moments are spent which are left you.</p>
            <p>I remain your sincere Friend, and well Wisher for your poor Soul,</p>

            <p>What has been said is not intended to blacken his Memory, or deprive him of the Pity which naturally arises in every Man's Mind, on those who fall Victims to Justice and Law. The Design of these Accounts is to benefit the Living, the Dead can receive neither Good nor Hurt from them. It is to be hoped, that such as have only enter'd on the Paths which brought this unhappy Man to his Ruin, will see by his Example, what themselves must come to, if they do not bethink themselves in Time Without Question, the inordinate Love of Pleasure, the Contempt not only of Religion, but Decency, the shameless Debauchery of Night-Houses, and the open Practice of GAMING, so notorious in this present Age, have a strong Tendency to mislead Men to their Ruin: And therefore, the Sacrifices made by the Law ought to be well explain'd, as the best and almost only Means to deter others from the like Practices. Reputation is quickly lost, hardly ever to be recovered, and when it is lost, People are apt to run Headlong into the most dangerous Practices, in order to procure Supplies for their Necessities and Pleasures, not apprehending how high a Price they may one Day pay for their past Follies and ill Conduct.</p>

            <p>SIR,</p>
            <p>I Have the Happiness to inform you, that I am in all Appearance entirely cured of my terrible Headach, and nervous Disorder, which had so grievously afflicted me for two Years successively; I have not perceived the least remaining Symptoms of it these six Months past. The present Health I now enjoy, compared with the Memory I still retain of my insupportable Disorder, is so joyful a Change to me, that it would be the greatest Ingratitude should I longer delay to return you my hearty Thanks and Acknowledgment in this publick Manner, who, under God have been the Restorer of my Health, even beyond what every one thought possible, or could have any Reason to hope for.</p>

I applied to the most eminent Physicians, who only told me it was a nervous Complaint, produced from Excess of Heat, which had stagnated the Juices of the Brain; and after Blistering, Bleeding, Cupping, and a deal of other Means, there was hardly any Relief. It would rage to such a Degree that I was almost distracted; at length it turned to a Vertigo, Giddiness, and Swimmings of the Head. My Pain was mostly in the hinder Part, with beating Noise of Wind, but at Times would lie with such a Weight upon my fore Part of my Head and Eyes, that I was afraid I should entirely lose my Sight; all which affected the Nerves, as brought a Paralyrick Trembling and Weakness all over my Body, with sometimes Convulsions; and the Use of my Speech much impared: I had no Rest Night nor Day, but was huried with confused and irregular Thoughts; my Stomach and Bowels would swell with Wind, then would fly to the Head, and bring on most of the aforesaid Disorders, with a strong Palpitation and trembling of the Heart. This was my miserable Case, and tho' a young Man, had given over Hopes of a Cure, 'till a Gentleman who had been almost in the same Condition as mine, and cured by your nervous Medicine, advised me to apply to you, as the only Person for the Cure of nervous Disorders, which accordingly I did; and sent for a Bottle of your nervous Medicine, with the Pills and Cephalick Snuff for the Head, which cost me Seven Shillings, and was presently relieved: so in a Month's Time I was entirely relieved, freed from my Disorders, and have not taken any Thing these six Months, and have no Apprehension of my Illness returning; for which I return you my most grateful Thanks, under Divine Providence, for my present happy State of Health, which is entirely owing to you.</p>
