            <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
            <p>And all, the People shall hear and fear and do no more presumptuously.</p>
            <p>DEUT. xvii. 13.</p>
            <p>EVERY civilized Nation has enacted penal Laws to restram Crimes, and protect Innocence and honest Industry: Of all the Laws framed for this Purpose, none are more wise and equitable than those enjoined to the Republic of the Israelites. One great Design of all which, is summ'd up in the Motto: To warn Men, against bold and presumptuous Crimes by seasonable and striking Examples of Punishment: And happy were it for the several Classes of People in this our Israel, if all who see or hear of these sad and shameful Examples of Punishment would so fear to offend God, or injure Man, as no more to transgress presumptuosly, and go on in a hardened Course of the prevailing Sins of the Times, which are the Reproach of human Nature, much more of a Christian Land; Such as, common and profane Cursing and Swearing, Drunkenness, Lewdness, the utter Neglect and more than brutal Comtempt of their Duty to their Creator and Preserver: Especially the Profanation of his Holy-Day, claimed and devoted by himself for promating his own Glory, and the Happiness of all Mankind; the Neglect of a due Celebration of which, is the Rood of all Irreligion and Iniquity, as long Experience has convinced every sober Man who regards the Peace, the Safety and Happiness of Society.</p>
            <p>Pity it is therefore, that the civil Masistrates, the Officers and Ministers of Justice, Decency and Order, in their several Districts both civil and ecclefistical, do no labour to lop these early Shoots and Excrescences of Impiety and Immorality in the But; by a diligent enforcing of the lesser penal Laws, in due Time: This, instead of an Instance of Severity, would appear an Act of great Mercy to the Young and Ignorant, the thoughtless and unwary Offenders, who by a timely Check, and a moderate Penalty, might be rescued from greater Evils, and restored to the Discipline of regular Morals, and a good Life.</p>

            <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
            <p>But now, instead of that, by an over-indulging Lentry, of rather Negligence in the executive Part of our Laws, they are suffered to run on to early, Ruin and quick Perdition, A most shocking Instance we have of the dangerous Corruption of routh in the Execution before us, when out of five that suffered, three of them didmake up twenty Years, each, one with another. And here the Occasion calls aloud on all Parents, and Masters of Families especially the labour ing Class, no less than those of higher Stations, to revive and keep up better Means of Instruction, in Order to promote true Religion and Virtue among their Children, Servants, and Dependants.</p>
            <p>How happily would this prevent the Grief, Shame, and Rum that ensues on the Loss of many useful and able Members of Society and save many Children and Servants from becoming a Reproach to their Families.</p>

            <p>After the death-warrant came, when she was examined concerning the justice of her sentence, she said, "It was welcome by the grace of God;" but asserted, that the witnesses Diamond, Etc. never saw any thing of her guilt; however, she pray'd for all that gave evidence against her, and professed to forgive them.But in farther asserting her innocence, and in the warmth of he defence, she prayed, that the guilty part of the evidence might, by divine justice be brought to the like punishment, which they had brought on her: but on reminding her of her first good prayers for them, she retracted this, and submitted with resignation, expressing strong hopes of a happy change.</p>
            <p>Being asked how she came to tell two different stories about the files found upon her, viz. 1st. That her little boy found them in the cellar the day before; she asserted, that was not meant of the files; but of a stick found in her closet by one of the officers who seized her; who said of it, This club used to go on the highway. To which she answered, Well were it for you Bob Sis, if you were as honest as the man who carries that stick; meaning her husband.</p>

            <p>Though she was brought up in the church of Rome the frequently attended divine service with us and when reproached for it by some foolprisoners, she declared, "No man should hinder her from hearing the word of God." But she held this good purpose no longer than till the next visit from a priest of that persuation, whose undue (not to say) tyrannic influence over their people, depends on their ignorance of the sacred scriptures, and whose authority in this nation they know will never prevail but in proportion as they can by every are seduce unwary people from the knowledge, veneration and love of the scriptures, and those ministers who  teach themand sidelity profaneness and fects without numbers make way for popery. These thoughts are published free as they arise on this occasion not quire unprovoking on seeing this and another poor convict who had made the like honest profession and practised accordingly, remanded back from the light and liberty of truth into the chains of error and darkness, for they dared no more appear at our chapel, where the word of God is daily read and explain'd to them, before which the dangerougs delusions of popery cannot long maintain their ground.</p>
            <p>I Know it has been often said that Popery is the finest religion in the world to be hanged with" but. I could never see the truth or reason of this unweigh'd opinion. If to go out of the world without making any true acknowledgment or satisfaction to the offended public of private party, if to die with alie in their month, and this relying on the false peace of an absolution obtained by an auricular a confession to a priest, instead of trusting to the only comfortable absolution by divine authority promised on the sure terms of true repentance and faith unfeigned, if this be the comfort they give to dying sinners in will never he envied them by any intelligent christian. Nor can the idolatrous worship paid to the host in their sacrifice of the mass, nor their prayers offered up to faints and angels. their new mediators, afford them any true consolation in compa-</p>

            <p>In truth, on the comparison their case is greatly to be pitied and lamented, who, by thus trusting in lying vanities, forsake their own mercy.</p>

            <p>He says, in particular, that he lost 170 l. by <persName id="OA17581002n33-1">

On this occasion he was within the rules of the <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-26">Fleet prison</placeName> (where he surrendered himself to discharge his bail) about a year and half, during which time he was partly supported by doing business by commission for some correspondents in the country. But, to add to the trouble of his losses and confinement, his wife was given to drinking and keeping such company as he did not approve of, so that they did not live very happily, or even peaceably together; and one morning she took the opportunity of his going to <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-27">Shoreditch</placeName> to buy wooll, and eloped with another man, leaving him neither linnen nor other goods that she could carry off, except two small children to maintain, without any thing for their subsistence; so that, he says, he was obliged to pledge his hat for money to buy them some food, and himself to fast three days, till going among some acquaintance they compassionately refreshed and relieved him with some kind and seasonable supplies. Among these benefactors, he was proud to mention a right worshipful magistrate of this city, who gave him a guinea and half, and encouraged him to call for more in time of need. After this, with some money lent him, and the help of credit,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175810020009"/>
            <p>he set up business in <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-28">Suffolk street</placeName>, <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-29">Southwark</placeName>, where he lived and dealt considerable for several years, only with an interval of one year he lived in Old-Street. In this time he dealt for 1200 l. a year with one house, 1600 l. a year with another, Etc. so that his trade was really considerable.</p>
            <p>About March 10. 1755, he had the misfortune of fire breaking out in one of his workshops, to which se- veral other houses (9 or 10) of his work-people being contiguous, two were consumed, and some others da- maged; the loss amounting to about 1700 l. in goods and buildings, of which 1000 l. or 1100 l. only was ensured. This fire, he says was ac- casioned by the charcoal used in the wooll combing business, and that he himself was in the house when it be- gan, though not in the very room.</p>
            <p>It has been suggested by a person who knew him at that time, that sus- picions were entertained of an evil design in burning these houses to de- fraud the ensurers; but if it be true that he lost 700 l. more than he had ensured, this suspicion must be ill- grounded, or such wicked purpose very ill execured.</p>
            <p>What he says himself concerning the crime for which he suffered, as well as concerning the unhappy accident of the fire, is as follows, viz. That the stock that he had to begin his business with, was but very small, but had many very good customers, who, as soon as he sent them goods, gave him their not's for a particular time; he took these notes, and had them discounted, that money-enabled them to go to market, and buy his goods at reasonable rates, and so filled his warehouses with all sorts that his customers wanted, and being an industrious man, and punctual to the orders given him, as well as serving them with good commondities, they had a good opinion of him, Mr. Cr especially lent him 300 l. about three years ago; some of which he paid, but some hotes which he had discounted, proved bad, by the persons who gave them failing, that he was obliged to make good the payments himself; and at the same time this dreadful accident of the fire happening, that he lost his house, warehouses, goods, apparel, books of accounts, Etc. was of the worst consequence to him, being himself incapable of judging how much his loss was, he was obliged to leave it to the computation of the most knowing people that worked for him, and about sixteen or eighteen of those people valued them to about 1600 l. but he thinks he could be certain they were worth above 2000 l. He then had a great many notes coming sandue for him to pay, and one in particular to Mr. Cr, of 400 l. and as his all was gone, he could not tell what to do but consulted his friends and creditors, who advised him so get together what was left from the fire, and begin his trade again, which he accordingly did, and which amounted to about 400 l. for which he gave proper security to the directors of the</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175810020010"/>
            <p>Fire. Office to their satisfaction, and so got to one of his old houses again.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cr had a bond and Jugment for the 300 l. first lent him, and now in his distress lent him 26 l. at one time, and 15 l. at another which enabled him to begin to rebuild his house and warehouses, Etc. But Mr. Cr coming to view them one day, he seemed not to like the building, and told him that he must lodge somewhat in his hands for security of his money; for his wife was uneasy at his (Carrier) owing him so much, but promised not to molest him, and would be glad of having bills, or some such things in his hands. He (Carrier) dealt largely with Messieurs Mgn and Co. and used to draw bills upon them, so gave him this bill on them for 180 l. when it was presented for acceptance, they lent a servant to him, that unless he would sent them more goods, or some other security, they would accept no more bills, which he promised to do, and on that account went to Mr. Hll, another customer, who promised to lend him 300 l. on a mortgage upon his house, and lent him 50 l. then, and set a day when he would lend him the rest, the time drawing near when the bill of 180 l. coming due, he went to his friend Mr. Hll to settle accounts with him, and to have the 300 l. as promised: he settled the account with him, and took the 50 l. but said he was disappointed of money, so could not lend him the 300 l. That shocked him much,-and could not tell what to do, but was advised to go to Messieurs Man and Co. and assign over his stock to them for their security, that all the bills he should draw on them should be paid, and when so paid, that he should have possession of his stock and trade again: the assignment was made and executed, and accepted of on that account; but they putting unfkilful people in possession, prejudiced the trade very much; and after they had been there in possession two months and upwards, they took out a statute of bankruptcy against him, and what they did in the affair, he never was as much as informed of, 'till the other day he saw some of his goods in a catalogue, to be disposed of by Mr. Spencer, at his late dwelling premises in Sussolk-street in the Mint, near St. George's-Fields, Southwark, on Wednesday and Thursday the 3d and 4th of August, 1757. This is all he says, and leaves the reader to judge his usage, and signs his name to it.</p>

            <p>On another occasion, being repeatedly pressed with motives and reasons to awaken him to true sense of his guilt, he persisted to declare himself innocent of all design ever to wrong any man of the value of 6d. and particularly in passing that draught, with a forged acceptance, for which he is to die; alledging,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175810020011"/>
            <p>that it was only given as a security till the mortgage of his house should be made over to Mr. Cooper.</p>
            <p>But, in order to come at the true state of the case, this assertion was mentioned to a less prejudiced person, who candidly represented the whole state of the transaction between Carrier, himself, and others, in so fair a light, that it was impossible not to see the guilt of many complicated fraudulent designs in the course of his dealings; particularly, it appears, that there are three other draughts for different sums, and with the same kind of acceptance passed by Carrier to other hands, for which he had some cash, and they lost the benefit of such draughts on account of the acceptance being forged; and had he not been convicted for the first, he was to be indicted for the others: and the following is a true account of those draughts, viz.</p>
            <p>First, That for the 180 l. drawn on Messieurs <persName id="OA17581002n44-3">

            <p>Thirdly, A draught drawn on ditto for 100 l. presented to Messieurs Atkinson and Abbiss in <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-30">Cornhill</placeName>, and obtained 60 l. on the credit of that draught.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, A, draught drawn on ditto, value not known, but presented to Mr. <persName id="OA17581002n47-1">

            <p>That he had made Mr. Cooper believe he had made over his house, Etc. to him as a security for 300 l. advanced him; but never did make it over, but afterwards put Messrs. Margesson and Collison in possession of all his effects, under pretence of securities to indemnify them for these draughts; which, however, they never paid, because a commission of bankruptcy took place: and that, when declared a bankrupt, he did not surrender, but instead of that, was secreted at <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-31">Writtle</placeName>, near <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-32">Chelmsford</placeName> in <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-33">Essex</placeName>, where he was set up, and carried on his trade under the seigned name of Bennet.</p>
            <p>He was born of religious parents in the dissenting way, who lived in credit and good repute, his father, in his old age, abode with him a year and a half, till disliking some of his proceedings. particularly his not observing the Lord's-day in a strict and religious manner, he quit him, and would stay no longer. This Carrier freely confessed, and on several occasions expressed great sorrow for this and all his other sins, during this his last confinement; and since his conviction he lost no opportunity of performing his duty in the chapel, declared himself intirely satisfied, and conformable to our</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175810020012"/>
            <p>church and died in the communion of it.</p>
            <p>He inted in the truth of the cafe as before related, and added that had he been sent to the compter tor the 180 l. as a debt, and Margesson and Collison been sued for it, they might have recovered their money, and saved his life.</p>
            <p>He declated as to his wife, she used him ill, by spending his money idly, and leaving him in trouble, as before mentioned: that he never was either inclined or able to treat her ill, she being strong enough to withstand him.</p>
            <p>In vindication of Carrier, he is said to have made over his Stock to Margesson and Collison to the value of 1500 l. on condition that they should pay all his bills, with their Acceptance by him forged; and out of the residue being restored to him he was to offer 5s. in the pound to his creditors; which if they would not accept of, he would make himself a Bencher in the <placeName id="OA17581002-geo-34">King's-bench prison</placeName> as he had been before.</p>
            <p>But instead of performing these conditions, 'tis believed the stock was garbled, being detained for 2 months, till recover'd on a statute of bankruptcy, and none of the above-mention'd bills being paid, he was at last found out, apprehended, prosecuted, and cast for his life.</p>

Being also asked, whether he had not unbolted the cellar door on the Saturday night before the robbery, when coming into the house, he called for a penny worth of beer, and made a pretence to go down to the cellar, as mentioned on the trial; he owned he did then unbolt the cellar door in order to get in next morning, as he actually did, Being further asked, whether he had left it open when he came in at midnight, in order to escape the more readily, if the house should be alarmed? He answered, No, he had shut it. It may be supposed for fear of the watch coming upon him.</p>
            <p>He was also further asked whether the young girl he courted had any part of the money be robbed from Mrs. Taylor. For he had lodged as the girl's father home the a chairmaker in CarolinaSaffron about six months, who used to charge his daughter not to keep company with that idle fellow, as he had no visible way of getting an honest livehhood But, on his declaring, as the asterts, that he had got this money by the death of an uncle at Greenwich, she consented to marry him, but providentially for her, they could not get a License. However, she went with him to buy cloaths and houshold furniture; and it appears by his own account, and other circumstances, that he intended with this money, first to inveigle his beloved girl to marry him, then to furnish a house, and to keep a chandler's shop. He denied that she had any of the money but a few shillings.</p>

Being asked what tempted him to this robbery? he could not say what moved him to rob his master unless the tempting opportunity of seeing the doors open, and none to hinder him. But it is suspected and believed by his master that he himself left the back gate open, and so got into the counting house, where the money lay in a desk this he pierced with a knife he carried, being remarkably large, but finding it not so easy to cut thro' as to force it open, he forc'd the forews of the lock. Sometime before this robbery, his master found the same gate left open at an unseasonable hour of the night, but by shuting it disappointed the supposed design of robbery for that time. He continued to frequent the chapel, and to behave himself decently there, 'till Tuesday the 26September he was ill in his cell and uncapable to come up.</p>
            <p>Wednesday the 27th the death warrant being come, and finding himself to be one of them ordered for execution, he made a hard shift to come to the chapel, tho' scarce able to get up stairs, or to hold up his head.</p>

The 28th and 29th he with great difficulty got up to prayers, but on the 30th was quite unable to get out of his cell, where, at his request, I visited him, labouring under a burning sever and a violent cough; in which we had all along given him such relief and assistance, as his circumstance would admit.

            <p>Ashe said when his master died in the time of his servitude, his mistress gave up the cooper's business to her son, and she sold beer at the Red-Cow in CowLane where he for some time was waiter and drew beer, and also tried a few weeks with her son, at the coopering; but not liking either of these, and having a bad fore leg, occasioned by some unluckly accidents which befer it, such as a cut of an adze, and then a wheel of a cant running over it, he had his indentures given up to him. He quitted that business and returned to his mother, where he used to work now and then, partly with his step father at gardening, and partly at any jobs he could get to do, such as driving of cattle about Smithfield, Etc. which he followed an times after he had inlifted into the guards, as before mentioned. Being asked, if he did then belong to the guards when he was approhended for the fact? he said he did, till convicted; but declares he never was concerned in any robbery or theft, nor would he own himself the person who committed thishowever he would not then take upon him to assert his innocence entirely in this affair, but acknowledged that by keeping ill company, he made those his enemies which would otherwise have been his friends.</p>
            <p>He had the good report of the prisoners, that since his conviction he spent his time in devout exercises, as reading, prayer and singing of Psalms when in his cell, which I can testify to be true.</p>
            <p>His behaviour in the chapel was attentive and servent, reading the Psalms in course as well as he could, and looking over the lessons also, in a Bible which was lent him, making the responses and joining in the prayers with seriousness.</p>
            <p>But, poor creature! he had the strong vanity upon him, too common to persons in his unhappy circumstances of concealing those false steps which led him gradually to this fatal period, although the duty of taking shame and guilt to themselves for the warning of others, and the satisfaction of the public is laid before them in the strongest light; for on declaring to some of his fellow soldiers and acquaintance, that he should dye innocent, some farther enquiry was made about his former behaviour, Etc. and it appeared that within this year he had been taken and punished for desertion, which was assigned as the reason why none of his officers or fellow soldiers appeared to his character at his tryal.

He warned all thectators against drunkenness and ill company, while Carrier, Downs and Head bid them beware of coveting what is not their own, for this was the beginning of their ruin.
