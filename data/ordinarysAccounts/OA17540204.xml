This person I got acquainted with, told me he had got a jobb to do at <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-42">Tottenham</placeName>, to remove some goods for a gentleman, who was afraid they would be seized on for rent: Accordingly we went on the appointed day, and going from one alehouse to another, till evening came on, was at last told by my companion, who pretended to see for the gentleman, that he had seen him, and it was too late to remove tonight, but he had given me eighteen-pence for my trouble, and that we must come on another day, Etc. Going home we met with a chaise with a man and woman in it, at a place called the <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-43">Seven Sisters</placeName>, on this side <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-44">Tottenham</placeName>, where the woman was set down from the chaise, and walked up the road, and I, as I past by her, said, Are you a going to <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-45">London</placeName>? It was now about seven o'clock at night, she answered yes, and I passed on. This companion of mine, unknown by name, behind. called, What do you walk so fast for? My answer was, To get to London; but turning about, saw him robbing the woman. He then ran after me, and said, Here, I have got some money, and would have forced half a crown into my hand; but I refused it. Then he said, Josh, don't leave me; I must step into the ditch, and ease myself. And walking gently on, to wait for my companion, up starts one Mac Donald, thief-catcher, and collars me, and said, You are my prisoner. He carried me directly to a justice, before whom the woman swore, that I, with a person unknown, robbed her of five and</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175402040008"/>
            <p>twenty shillings and six pence. So I was committed to jail, and tried on the woman's swearing that I, with the unknown person, robbed her, and threatened her life. The person's name that was in the chaise is Berry, the woman's name. Jones; the man well known to be thief-catcher, the woman of as bad a character as need be.</p>
            <p>His friends, as soon as they found what a scrape he had got into, being alarmed by his sending to acquaint them of his being committed, resolved to see him, that they might know whether his calamity deserved their assistance, or no. They went to him, and received the account, as above, from which he never varied from first to last. The account he give of the matter encouraged them to enquire further into it, that they might find whether his story was true, or not, before they applied to seek any interest to save his life. They went to enquire for the prosecutrix, but she was not to be found, tho' they enquired at the house where she lived, in Brooker's-alley, in Drury-lane, as she said upon the trial; nor could Kidden's friends meet with any one in her neighbourhood, that had heard of her being robbed at all.</p>
            <p>Upon their second enquiry they found out where she lived, and then the people of the house had heard something of a robbery committed on her, but she was not to be seen. Her character being enquired into was reported such, as (I shall only say what they told me) encouraged them to believe the young fellow's story true, and then they did endeavour to save his life, but their application had not the desired effect. However, their enquiry was sufficient to satisfy them in their own minds, that his declaring himself innocent of the crime laid to his charge, did not proceed from a wicked design to conceal the truth, but was truth itself. They are satisfied with the justice of the conviction, and sentence, and own, they should have done as was done, had they been to have given their opinion upon such evidence as appeared to the court against Kidden; but as various circumstances convinced them, that his new friend had trepanned him, and laid a scheme to take away his life, they did all they could to save him, but could not, for want of that knowledge of the matter they got at when it was too late, and could not come at sooner, because some people were not so readily to be met with. Kidden declared to the last, that he knew not of any intent to rob, and went only on the errand of the expected jobb, that he never touched her cloaths, nor her hand, though she swore he held up her arms, while the other robbed her; he declared to the last, as a dying man, that he was 30 yards distant at least, when he looked back, and saw the other man about robbing the woman, if any robbery there was. He declar'd, his innocence to the last, and died resigned to the will of the Almighty, who only can turn his sorrow into joy. As this affair was transacted on the road to <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-46">Stamford-hill</placeName>, some persons</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175402040009"/>
            <p>living in the neighbourhood apply'd to have Kidden asked, whether he was not one of the three, who some years ago robbed the Irishman going to London, near Stamford, also several higglers early in the morning? Whether of late he was not one of the two, who robbed, and beat several persons, on, or about Stamford-hill, in the evening, and only two in company? What What may be become of the 3d person? was the name of his late accomplice? To all which queries he declares himself to be a stranger, that he knew neither where Stamford-hill was, nor was upon that road to his knowledge, till the unfortunate time his new companion took him out upon the intended jobb. And, this was true, he said, as he hoped for forgiveness from God. And he positively deny'd this fact, for which he lost his life, with his last breath.</p>

            <p>HAving receiv'd an account of your being apprenticed, and consequently of your entrance on a new state of life, hitherto altogether unknown to you, I thought it would be no ways improper to give you some short advice, which, during your apprenticeship, may reasonably be supposed to stand you in some stead; and I hope you will be the more careful to take it, when you consider it comes from a father, who would heartily have you do well, and has also a great tenderness and affection for you.</p>
            <p>The first thing I recommend to you, and which I press upon you very earnestly, is a constant attendance on the worship of God, which is now used and practised in the church of England; for you may assure yourself whatever some unreasonably prejudiced, or misguided people may say to the contrary, it is the best reformed church under heaven, and that salvation may be had in that as well as in any other church or communion whatsoever. I desire therefore, nay, I charge you on my blessing, to keep yourself from all meetings, or separate congregations whatsoever. I would not on any account have you guilty of that thing, which, if any thing, will make me very uneasy, and be the readiest way of forcing me to that which I would not willingly do, the lessening of my love and affection to you.</p>
            <p>And as I would above all things have you a true son of the church of England, so also I strictly charge and command you to be a faithful servant to your master and mistress; study to get a perfect knowledge of their temper and dispositions, and adapt and suit yourself to them: be sure to soften and calm their displeasure by an obliging answer, and a respectful be-</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175402040010"/>
            <p>haviour; ever bearing in mind the saying of the wise man; a soft answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger. Whatsoever they command, do it willingly and chearfully, that so they may see you take a singular delight in their service, and are never better pleased than when you are executing their just and lawful commands. Above all things abominate the name and character of an eye-servant, and that ever to be condemned habit of staying out much, or late, out of your master's house; to prevent which, keep yourself close to your business. Hate all extravagancies and excesses whatsoever in meat or drink, and all soppishness in apparel. Be neither wasteful of your master's greater, nor your own lesser stock: be free and generous, but not lavish and prodigal; sparing and srugal, but not greedy or covetous; neat and handsome, but not starch or proud; and ever remember to be sober, diligent, and honest, and that beggary and shame are the constant companions of dishonesty and idleness. In a word, endeavour to answer all those promises and engagements you have made to your master in your indentures of apprenticeship; which being voluntarily subscribed with your own hand, is now safely laid up, and will readily be produced upon the default of your duty, as a swift and incontestable witness against you. Therefore let your serious application of yourself to your business give an undeniable proof, that your great desire is to be an industrious and faithful apprentice; and that you have no other aim in view, but the advancement of your master's interest, and the improvement of your trade. By such a discreet and well-ordered conduct, you cannot but engage your master and mistress to love you, and to have a more than common kindness for you, and you will soon find the happy effects thereof in your apprenticeship; for your service will seem easy and pleasant, your life sweet and comfortable, and the joy of your parents great and unspeakable.</p>
            <p>And I advise you farther, that to all your superiors you be obliging and respectful; to all your equals affable and familiar; and to those in a lower station kind and courteous; and to no one surly or morose. Court the society of the good and virtuous, and shun all idle and loose companions, backbiters, and slanderers, especially all such whom you have any reason to suspect are any ways disassed to your master. Keep no company with those who shall attempt to wheedle you into an ill opinion of, or disrespect for him; who shall openly or privately soment, or widen any differences between him and you: Be sure to stop your ears to all idle and malicious stories, which may any ways tend to his defamation, prejudice, or disadvantage. And that you may be the more effectually enabled to follow the good advice of your father, I charge and enjoin you to send up your prayers to your better Father in heaven, for His Holy Spirit, to direct and assist you in all things for God's glory, your master's good, your parent's joy, and your own comfort.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175402040011"/>
            <p>These, my dear child, are the short and seasonable instructions, which, at this time, I thought fit to give you; the exact observation of them, as it will certainly entail God's blessing on all your proceedings, so, you may assure yourself, it will mightily endear you to your master and mistress, to your parents and relations, and to all other true friends. I have no more to add, but with our blessing to recommend you to God's most holy keeping, and am, with all sincerity.</p>
            <p>Your very affectionate Father.</p>

                     targets="OA17540204n50-1 OA17540204-occupation-38"/>, he says, he had several masters, for whom he worked in several counties, and lived, some time after he left home, in an honest exercise and labour. But, about five years ago, he began to play his pranks, and has every now and then made an execution, to steal a horse and sell it; and having lived upon the money some time, till he got into a place of honest employ, he then again took to labour and industry; so that the five last years of his life, he owns, have been chequered with industry and labour, idleness and thievery; a great part of which he has, in a vagabond manner, passed away, struggling from one country to another, living upon his wits, and stealing horses in different parts of the country.</p>
            <p>The first theft of this kind he was guilty of, he says, was stealing a colt, after he had broke him for a master he lived with; which he stole, and sold, and then left his said master. But passing by his door, and not calling in, nor taking any notice of the house, he caused a suspicion, and was taken hold off, and charged with the theft.</p>
            <p>He had not the assurance to deny it, but would not discover where the horse was, till the right owner promised to make the matter up. It was consented, and he told where he sold it; which being recovered, he was let go without any farther notice taken for that time; only being reproached for it, and advised not to do so any more, left next time he might meet with more severe usage.</p>
            <p>This was, however, no warning to him; he seemed to resolve to push on to his ruin, and acknowledges to have stolen several other horses, tho', as to particulars, he was silent, and did not choose to say any more, but that he believed most of them had been found out, and recovered by the owners, tho' he had escaped thus far as the stealer.</p>
            <p>But at length his fate overtook him, and to make sure, he stole two horses, one from <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-50">Hounslow</placeName>, and the other from <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-51">Twickenham</placeName>, and left that country, travelling towards the West. He arrived as far as <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-52">Reading</placeName>, and intended for his own country, but being detected once more in his roguers, was apprehended there, and not being able to make appear how he came by the mares, which were</p>

He was bred a <rs id="OA17540204-occupation-39" type="occupation">butcher</rs>
               <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                     targets="OA17540204n56-1 OA17540204-occupation-39"/>, and came up to London to serve his time, and to learn that trade. He says he served his time in <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-56">St. James's</placeName>, and <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-57">Clare-market</placeName>, and was journeyman in the <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-58">Fleet-market</placeName>, where be afterwards set up for himself in the trade, and married the daughter of a man of reputation, of the same trade, about two years ago.</p>
            <p>Whatever he had been before, I am afraid he was not truly industrious after he went into business for himself. There was some demur about the marriage, and not the best behaviour, or honour, shewn on his part; which made the parent of his unfortunate wife dissatisfied, and put off the match for some time. But Wood afterwards found means to marry the girl without consent of her father, to the now great uneasiness of both.</p>
            <p>He, for some time past, has lived at <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-59">Hesson</placeName>, near <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-60">Acton</placeName>, and carried on trade. By some of that neighbourhood he was looked upon as an honest man, by others the contrary was suggested; and when these sheep, Etc. were missed by the owner, he was the first person suspected; and, upon proper enquiry, was found to be the unfortunate man who had stolen sheep, Etc. being pitched upon by reason of the indifferent character he bore among some in the neighbourhood. He owned the fact as soon as charged with it, his conscience not being yet so hardened as to deny the truth; tho' he did attempt to charge two people, by name Chapman But he has since acknowledged to a gentleman, who came from Hesson, on purpose to know the truth of the matter, that they were not concerned with him in this robbery of Mr Marsh.</p>
            <p>The sheep, Etc. were found in his own possession, in a stable belonging to him, and he says, he drove them there himself. If he had minded his business in an honest way, he need not to have feared getting a livelihood, but his mind was too much given to pleasure. And though he was not in great trade, he might have carried on business enough for his present purpose, and in time it would have grown better. For, had he been honest, he would not have wanted the countenance of some in the neighbourhood, who wished him well, and might in time have been able, as they were willing to serve him; He was very ill after conviction , behaved well, and repenting of the evil of his doings, he died resigned to his fate, acknowledging the justice of his suffering.</p>

He had a good education, and was better instructed than his practice has been. He was brought up at a publick school in town, but did not leave it with the greatest honour and applause.

He was so well in the world, as to be master of 3 or 4 carts himself, but extravagance and an evil mind laid him in the way of being seduced to practices, which seldom fail to meet with deserved punishment.</p>
            <p>He says, he had got acquainted with one Peters, accomplice with him in the fact for which he suffered, who led him into that and several other burglaries.</p>
            <p>The first fact Barnard committed was a robbery on the highway. But he did not like that lay. thinking it too dangerous exposing his person, and be rather chose the secret cover of the night, the most wicked of the two evils, and ungenerous practice. It is a practice, which we see the government seldom. If ever shews mercy to, as it is surprizing people in their unguarded hours.</p>
            <p>About 4 months ago it is, he says, since he begun these practices, and several burglaries have he, and Peters, mentioned in the trial, been guilty of.</p>
            <p>They robbed <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-64">Mr Coap and Company's compting-house</placeName> of near 70l. also the compting-house of others, wholesale whale-bone sellers, of 8 or 9l. in money, both in <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-65">Thames-Street</placeName>.Mr. <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-66">Carter's compting-house</placeName> in the same neighbourhood, and a house in <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-67">Milk-street</placeName>.

From another gentleman's compting-house they stole 6l. worth of half-pence: besides many other burglaries, most of them known to the persons robbed, were committed by Barnard and Peters, within this four months past, in the neighbourhood of <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-70">Bread-Street</placeName>, and <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-71">Thames-Street</placeName>. But, Providence seemed to determine Mr. Tree's to be the last Barnard should be concerned in. Being disturbed the first night, gave opportunity to watch them the next, and so a stop was put to his career. He seemed to die sensible of his wickedness.</p>

Coming to <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-76">England</placeName> about two years ago, he married soon after, he says, a very honest and sober woman. They lived together very well, while his stock lasted, which was not a long time; and then neither of them having any employment to follow, they became very necessitous.</p>

He was a stout, hearty man, capable, almost, of any labour, tho' too much given to idleness, which reduced him to such poverty, as, he said, drove him to the committing the fact for which he suffered. He had great hopes of saving his life, as he was recommended to mercy, when found guilty; but I can't say I observed much difference in his behaviour, after he found himself included in the warrant. He appeared, before and after, even to the last, with a very steady and composed countenance.</p>
            <p>This, he persisted to say, was the first fact of the kind he ever committed; which he could not but own was a very bold and impudent attempt. He says he waited near the shop some time, before he could find the opportunity; but, at length, seeing the two persons engaged, and busy in the shop, he went, and stooping under the bulk, got the bundle of stockings upon his head, and was marching off with them. He says, he thought himself safe, and that no one saw him remove them, but he was mistaken; for he had not gone far with them, before he was apprehended, and brought back to the shop.</p>
            <p>He seemed penitent, prayed very heartily, and went to suffer with his wonted composure of face: He hoped for forgiveness through Christ, and begged no-body would reflect on his wife, for that she was a stranger to his misdeeds.</p>

            <p>When they arrived at <placeName id="OA17540204-geo-100">Tyburn</placeName>, these twelve victims to their own evil conduct, were all put into one cart, and, the halters being fixed about their necks, they were tied to the fatal tree. They all appeared very serious, and duly affected with their unhappy situation. Barnard read aloud, and very audibly, from the Common-prayer-book, to the eight protestants; not ceasing to read, from the time of his arrival at the place of execution, till the last office, recommending their souls to the divine protection, was performed. Neale likewise read, with great earnestness, and incessantly, in a Manual of devotion, which he carried with him: his two Roman catholick fellow sufferers attending to him. They all joined in frequent cries to Jesus Christ to receive their sinful souls. Barnard made a very decent appearance, as also did Neale; but neither of them were observed to shed a single tear; which is, however, no proof of their want of penitence, but, perhaps, of the contrary; for tears are often indications only of passion, while true sorrow is chiefly felt at the heart; and is rather the parent of silence, than of tumultuous exclamations and wailings.</p>
