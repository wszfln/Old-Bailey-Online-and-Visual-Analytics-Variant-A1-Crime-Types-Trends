            <p>They were all exhorted to pray earnestly for the Grace of God, and that they might be renewed in the Spirit of their Minds; and by sincere Repentance might be enabled, with full Purpose of Heart, to turn to God in Christ, and save their Souls from everlasting Misery.</p>
            <p>Two of them having been convicted of murdering their own Wives, I exposed to them the great Evil of their most horrid Sin, and endeavoured to convince them, that Murder is the highest Degree of Wrong we can do to our Neighbours; and that the Heinousness of it might be seen by the Consequence of the first Act of this Kind that ever was committed; Abel's Blood crieth from the Earth, God tells Gain; Gen. iv. 10. yea, the Guilt of this Sin is such, that it leaves a Stain even upon the Land where it is committed, such as is not to be wash'd out, but by the Blood of the Murderer, as appears, Deut. xix. 12, 13. In the Case of wilful Murder, no Refuge was allow'd but such a one was to be taken thence, and delivered up to Justice, Exod xxi. 14. Thou shalt take him from my Altar, that he may die; and it, is our Saviour tells us, Matt. v. 22.

            <p>They were put in Mind of their renewing their Baptismal Covenant by receiving the Sacrament of the Lord's-Supper, and they were instructed in the Nature of this Sacrament.</p>
            <p>They attended in Chapel, when Health allowed them, and were attentive to Prayers and Exhortations, behaving devoutly to Appearance, and some of them, sometimes wept and lamented, only <persName id="OA17381108n15-1">

This (as he alledg'd) was the only Occasion of all the Misfortunes which befell both him and his Wife, and was the Cause of the execrable Murder of the one, and disgraceful End of the other. He complained of some People, particularly some Women who were intimate with his Wife, of whom he did not speak well, and who too much fomented and forwarded their Dissentions. He complained that she provoked him to such a Degree, that he frequently gave her Blows, for which he was once imprisoned in <placeName id="OA17381108-geo-9">

Mr. Whalley was no sooner at Freedom, but Quarrels began again, and she (as he said) still aggravated him more and more, and after many Disputes, which were always attended with Blows, on the 10th of June last, he came Home in a violent Passion, and with a strong clasp Knife, he stabbed her in the Shoulders, in the Throat, under the left Ear, and cut her along the Breast, and the Effusion of Blood was so great, that it occasioned her Death, and on the 6th of July she expired. Whalley was a passionate, fiery Man, and it may be presumed the Wife had ill Advice, there having been some Lodgers and others who intermeddled too much in their private Affaires, and secreted some of his Goods.

At first he talked much of the Manifestations of God's Love to his Soul, but afterwards he became much more remiss and careless; I endeavoured to convince him of the Necessity of trusting only in God, submitting to his holy Will, and waiting for his Salvation thro' Christ. Upon this he promised to be more careful, and to avoid falling into Fits of Passion, which some who pretended to visit him, were continually stiring up in him, by upbraiding and reproaching him. He owned he was a great Sinner, and he often wept like a Child. After the Dead-Warrant came out, he seemed more affected, and less concerned about the World. He declared his Faith in Christ, that he truly repented of all his Sins, and heartily forgave all the World.</p>

Besides this, he acknowledged he had committed many other Thefts and Robberies, and that he associated with a Gang of Highwaymen. He was very penitent, and lamented much his having kept Company with lewd Women.

A great many of the Quakers profession came to visit him, and it is to be feared, they put him too much in hopes of Life, which did him no good. His Maid constantly attended him in the Day-time, and he behaved always with abundance of Civility and good Manners: He declared that he believed in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the Satisfaction of Christ, and that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were divinely inspired Writings, necessary for the Rule of Life and Manners, &amp;c. that he forgave every Body, and sincerely repented of all his Sins, and died in Communion with the Quakers.</p>

He married a Wife, and, if he had been careful, they might have been in, no necessity of committing irregularities for want of Bread. He had been often in Prison, and had a very bad Character; and he own'd he was guilty of petty Thiefts, and innumerable Cheats in the way of Money-dropping. As to the Fact he was convicted of, he would not own it in all its Circumstances. He blamed a certain Man mightily, for the Prosecution against him; but it is common for such Persons to be displeased with all them who are for suppressing Vice. He own'd himself, to have been a very vicious young Man, and that it was just with God that this Punishment had befallen him. He had used the Sea for three or four Years, but was soon tired with that way of Life. He was very ignorant of religious Matters, and could hardly read; but hoped for Salvation from God, through the Merits of Jesus Christ, and said he repented of all his Sins, and forgave all the World.</p>

So! thought I, I have made a pretty Spot o'Work on't! My new Wife will soon make an End of all that my poor old Wife and I have work'd for! I am certainly ruin'd, and must come to the Parish in my old Age! Lord! thinks I, what must I do now! I thought I would talk to her, and accordingly I took an Opportunity to tell her, that the Way she was going would end in the Ruin of us both. But instead of hearing what I had to say, she immediately calls her Companion C - k, and they both fel a raving against me, and telling me how I must behave to my Wife. Heyday! says I, I thought I had marry'd but one Wife, but to my great Surprize I find I am to be perswaded that I have marry'd two. Pray Madam, (says I to C - k) what Business have you with my Wife! Be gone about your Business! My new Who would not part with her, but sided with her, which provok'd me so highly, that I resolved to get away from them, and in a very little Time I set out for Gravesend; 'twas a very raiy Day, and the Wind blew very hard, but I resolved to be gone, and accordingly I went thither in the This Boat, thro' all the bad Weather.</p>

Then I thought it high Time to enquire after my Money, for my Wife had it in her keeping, and with some Difficulty I got what was left, but there was so much of it gone, that I told her I would go no more to Work, it signify'd nothing for me to work hard, and live hard, to save a Penny, if she must squander it away faster than I got it.</p>

All I could get from her was hard Names, and more Provocation.</p>
            <p>Some Time after this, I was speaking to her about the Lodgers that were in the House, and a Fellow over hearing me, came into my Room and abused me very much, my Wife encouraged him, and took his Part all the while, which vex'd me very much, and alarm'd the rest of the Lodgers. I found myself in a violent Passion, so I got away from them, and went to a neighbouring House, where I staid till my Passion was over; then I came out, intending to go Home to Bed, but one Mr Smith, who lives at Mr. Dash's the Tobacco Merchant, met me, and told me, there was something more than ordinary adoing at my House, and advised me not to go Home. I said I was resolved to go Home to Bed, and accordingly went up Stairs; I found Mrs. B - r, the Constable and 2 Watchmen on the Top of the Stairs, they refused to let me go into my own Apartment, and B - r cry'd out, Who see him strike his Wife? I did, said one, and I did, said another; upon which a Baker that lodged in the House asked the Constable if he would order him to take Charge of me? The Constable said yes, he did, upon which he took hold of my Arm, and whirl'd me down 3 or 4 Stairs, and I fell with my Back against the Edge of the Stairs, with such Violence, that I thought I had been lam'd. In the Hurry I felt in my Pocket for my Penknife, and endeavoured to prick him with it, and I did cut thro' his Great Coat; but they over power'd me, and carry'd me to the Compter, and before I could make up this Matter, it cost me upwards of 40 l.</p>

From a Child he discover'd a roving Disposition, and would never be perswaded either to live with his Friends, or settle to any Business, tho' his Relations were People of Credit and Reputation, and some of them able and willing to have provided for him: He himself would have had four Four Score Pound per Annum, had he liv'd till Christmas; and on the Death of a Relation, pretty much advanc'd in Years, he would have been possess'd of 120 l. per Annum more.

            <p>One Exploit which he valu'd himself much upon, and for which he often applauded his own Contrivance and Ingenuity, was his robbing the Lady Moore in <placeName id="OA17381108-geo-84">

            <p>One of his Companions, who was by Profession a Watch-maker, had got some Acquaintance with the Lady's Footman, by having mended a Watch for him. The Footman, over a Pot of Beer, inform'd this Man that his Lady was very ill, and was confin'd to her Chamber; that her Eyes were very bad, the Disorder having fallen upon them, and that Dr. Plumbtree in Bow-Lane attended her.</p>
            <p>He thinking Fluelin's Genius might improve this Information to their Advantage, he immediately tells him the Condition Lady Moore was in, and left it to him to make use of it. Fluellin had been successful enough at the Business, not to want Money or Cloths fit for any Design, and he resolv'd to practise upon the Lady the next Morning. Accordingly he orders another of the Society (whom we shall call by the Name W. -) to attend him then as a Footman. When the Time came, Fluellin dress'd himself in his best Cloths, put on a silver hilted Sword, and took Coach for <placeName id="OA17381108-geo-85">

            <p>of Eye-water at an Apothecary's Shop; and being come to the Lady's House, the Footman (W - jumps from behind the Coach and raps at the Door. A Maid Servant open'd it, and W - told her, she must go to the Coach and speak to the Gentleman Upon which the Gentleman in the Coach told her, his Father (Dr. Plumtree) presented his Service to the Lady, and had thought of a Remedy, which he perswaded himself would be of singular Service to the Lady's Eyes; that he had sent it by him, and if she pleased he would alight and shew her the Use of it. The Maid inform'd her Lady of all this, and the young Doctor was order'd up into the Lady's Chamber, while the Footman (W -) waited in the Kitchen for his Master's coming down again. Fluellin having told the Lady his Story, she suffer'd him to wet her Eyes with a Feather dipp'd in his Eye water, after which he pull'd out two Guineas, and told her she must shut them close, and must permit him to lay a Piece of Gold on each Eye, for five or six Minutes. This was done; and while the Guineas were upon the Lady's Eyes, he convey'd her Gold Watch and Equipage which hung upon a Sconce, and a Diamond Girdle Buckle off the Table (which they afterwards sold for 80 l.) into his Hat, covering them with his Handkerchief. When he had got what he could he told the Lady, he fear'd the Light would be too strong for her Eyes, immediately after the Use of the Medicine, so he made bold to draw all the Window Curtains close before he took off the Guineas; then he asked her whether she did not perceive an Alteration for the better? The Lady told him she thought she did, and that though the Room was darken'd, yet she could see the Sconce, and her Watch hanging upon it. Fluellin complimented her upon her Amendment, and desiring her to go on with the Use of the Medicine, he took his Leave.</p>
            <p>When he came down Stairs he desired the Maid to let him have a little Table-beer; upon which she invited him into the Parlour, and while she was gone for the Beer, he added some silver Spoons and other Plate (which lay in the Beaufet) to the Cargo which was already in his Hat. He took the Beer from the Maid at the Parlour Door, and having drank a little, he made her a Present of a Crown, and W - (his Footman) come out of the Kitchen (where he had not been idle) and conducted the Doctor to the Coach, in which they carry'd away the Booty.</p>
            <p>About a Month after this, Fluellin dress'd up W - like a Countryman, in a riding Coat, girt round him with a broad sacking Belt, buckled with four Buckles, intencing to * clack the Doctor, upon Mr. Robinson a Surgeon, in <placeName id="OA17381108-geo-86">

And accordingly they waited about the Street, till they saw Mr. Robinson and his Man go out; then they knock'd at the Door, and enquir'd for Mr. Robinson. The Maid told them her Master was abroad, but it would not be long before he returned. Fluellin took the Maid a little aside, and told her he was a Doctor, and the Countryman bring in a terrible Pickle with the Foul Disease, there was a Necessity for manual Operation, and he had brought him to her Master, who would get five Guineas for the Job. Upon this the Maid desired them to walk into the Surgery, and sit down. While they were there, W - complained that he was very ill and wanted to go to the Necessary House. The Maid directed him to the Place; and as he pass'd through the Entry, he look'd into the Rooms to see what might be got. Upon his Return into the Surgery he told Dr. Fluellin, he had seen a Tale, (a Sword) a Scout, (a Watch) a Calm and Shade, (a Hat and Wig) a Brace of Wedges, (Silver Buckles) and an outside Toge, (a Cloak) The Maid heard this Cant, but not understanding a Syllable of it, she imagin'd the Countryman's Head was out of Order, and he complaining terribly of his Pain, the Doctor seemed very much concerned for his Patient, and desired the Maid to get him a little Ale and warm it. While she was gone they seiz'd all the things that have been mention'd, and a large Silver Tankard besides, which were convey'd into Bags, fasten'd under the Countryman's Great Coat. The Maid returning with the warm Ale, before they had quite got themselves in Order, she observ'd them both to be in some Confusion, and asked them what was the Matter? Fluellin (ever ready with an Excuse) told her, his poor Patient had had a most terrible Fit, while she had been gone, and was so bad that he could not sit down; therefore he would take him to Chapman's Coffee-house, (in the Neighbourhood) and would stay there till Mr. Robinson came home, desiring the Girl to let</p>
            <p>* Clacking the Doctor, is when one of the Gang personates a Physician, and under Pretence of coming with a Patient to the Surgeon for Advice, they watch their Opportunity to rob him.</p>

            <p>him have Pen and Ink, and a Bit of Paper, because he would leave a Letter for him, which she must be sure to give him when he came home. The innocent Wench furnish'd him with Materials, and he wrote a Letter, beginning - Mr. Mac coo' trick' em, - and informing him that he had lost something by not being at home, when Customers call'd upon him; and if he was desirous to know how much he had suffer'd by being abroad, he must look into his Parlour,-for it had been visited by</p>

            <p>The Letter was seal'd up and left with the Maid, and the Doctor and his Patient, instead of going to the Coffee-house, march'd off with the Plunder.</p>
            <p>By these Devices, he always kept himself full of Cash; and that he might never want Materials or Tools for the various Branches of his Art, he laid out between forty and fifty Pounds with Mr. S - s, a Goldsmith in <placeName id="OA17381108-geo-87">

Mrs. Cox shew'd the Ring to a Jeweller, who told her it was a good Security for the Money. When she return'd she told him she would lend him twelve Guineas upon it. Yes, (says he) I don't doubt but you will, - but you must take particular Care of it; - 'tis a Gentleman's, who has lost some Money at Play, at our House, and he has sent his Watch and Seal and I have Orders to seal it up in a Piece of Paper, that you may not change it, - pulling out a Watch, with a Cornelian Seal. Mrs. Cox was very willing it should be seal'd up, and deliver'd it to him; he seal'd it up, and by Slight of Hand - tipp'd her a queer one, - done up in the same Manner in its Stead.</p>
            <p>'Twas laid down by him, to his Companions, as a Maxim, that they must look upon themselves as in a State of War with, and Opposition to, all Mankind; therefore they must spare neither Friend nor Foe, when Money was short with them. As a Proof of his firmly adhering to this Maxim, she first Time they were put to their Shifts, he inform'd them, his Mother had a fine repeating Clock, valu'd at twenty five Pounds, which he would undertake to procure for the Subsistence of the Fraternity; and he was as good as his Word; for without much Difficulty he found Means to bring it off to his Companions, who immediately pawn'd it for 7 l. Fluellin's Mother soon finding out who had stole her Clock, and where it was pawn'd, she went to the Pawnbroker and told him, the Clock he had received, was stolen from her by her Son; and she was sure he would soon want Money, and so would come or send to him again about it, therefore she desired him to stop the Persons that should come. And it was not long before they determin'd to raise a little more Money upon it by selling it outright. To this Purpose they consulted one Moses S - n, a Jew, (who used to buy their ill-gotten Goods of Value) and W - was employ'd to tell the Jew, there was such a Clock in Pawn, for 7 l. which was worth three Times the Money, and if he would redeem it, for a Trifle more, they would sell it outright to him. The Jew consented, and went with W - to the Pawnbroker's to see the Clock. The Pawnbroker remember'd the Orders given him by Fluellin's Mother, but fearing he should lose the Clock and the 7 l. too, he spoke to W - and the Jew very kindly; shew'd them the Clock, and took the 7 l. and the Interest, which came to 24 s. from the Jew, then whipp'd the Clock out of the Way, and charged a Constable with them both. They were carry'd before a Magistrate, but it not appearing that W - was the Person that stole the Goods, he was discharg'd, and the Jew left to seek his Remedy in the best Manner he could, for his Money.</p>

Fluellin asked the Pawnbroker three Guineas upon it, and said his Father was a Farmer at Rumford, and that his Father's Men had brought some Loads of Hay to Town, but not having sold any, they were at a Loss for Money to discharge their Expences in Town, and therefore he must leave his Watch with him till next Market-Day. The Man paid no Regard to this Story, but stopped the Watch, till they should bring somebody to vouch the Watch was his own. This put Fluellin and his Comrade into Despair of ever recovering it again, for they did not doubt but it would be advertised. In this Dilemma, they had Recourse to their old Friend R &#8211; I -, and told him the Story, promising him a Ridge or two (a Guinea or two) to get the Watch out of the Pawnbroker's Hands. He promised to do it, and accordingly the next Morning Fluellin came on Horseback to a Publick House, (the next Door to the Pawnbroker's) and as soon as R &#8211; I - came to him, they both went to the Pawnbroker's to demand the Watch, Fluellin leaving his Horse at the Alehouse Door. R &#8211; I - told the Pawnbroker, that the Gentleman (Mr. Fluellin) had bought the Watch of him, that his Name was Burton, and the Number upon it was 780. The Pawnbroker said, he believed they were both Rogues, and told them he was resolved not not to deliver it. Upon which Fluellin pulled out a Brace of Pistols, and with horrid Imprecations, swore he was a dead Man that Instant if he did not deliver it immediately, or offered to make the least Noise. The Man was terrified at the Sight of two cock'd Pistols, and returned it. Fluellin with Threats kept him silent, while R &#8211; I - got out of the Shop, and then he immediately ran out himself, jump'd upon his Horse's Back, and rode Pistol in Hand quite through <placeName id="OA17381108-geo-97">

Fluellin immediately fell to mentioning the Danger honest Men were liable to in travelling, as the Roads were so infested with Rogues. The Quaker said, he was not much afraid of being robbed, for he had a good brisk Horse under him. Aye, but I am (says Fluellin) for my Father is a Grasier at East-Ham, and I have 300 l. about me of his Money, therefore  would be obliged to you if you would let me ride your Horse. The Quaker refused, but Fluellin and W - pulled out their Pistols, and bid him surrender his Horse and his Money, or he was a dead Man.

Once in particular, they bought a Two-penny Handbasket, which they fill'd with Straw and a few Bricks; and having got two Geese-Necks, they sew'd up the Basket, letting the two Heads hang out at each End of the Basket; (and directed it on a Parchment Label, to somebody at Oxford) W - was order'd to carry this to the White Swan-Inn, at Holhorn-Bridge: He was very careful to see the Parcel book'd, and happen'd to see a large Parcel of Hats, which were enter'd next to his two Geese, he came back and gave Information of the Particulars, and who they were directed to. Immediately one of them put on a brown Apron, and another drest himself like a Porter, and describing (very particularly) the Goods, desired to have them back, for some of the Sortments were to be altered, Time enough for the Goods to come again before the Carrier went out, by this Means they got the Hatts, which were sold at Half Crown a Piece, and the Money divided between Fluellin, Ramsey and W -.</p>

            <p>GOOD MADAM,</p>
            <p>HAD I the Eloquence of Cicero, it would be too little to set forth your Goodness and Charity to me all my whole Life, and in all my Adversities, when every body had forsaken me, but my God and you; and I most humbly beg that you will remember me in your Prayers, and more particular, to put them up in your Church. Dear Madam, as you have been a Parent to me, ever since my own dyed, and who as I have always found as such, even in all my Troubles and Adversities, when despised even by my own Blood, but as she is dead, I must draw a Vale, since neither the affinity of Blood, and I being the last of the Family (though I own myself guilty of Faults) cou'd ever bring her Face to Face: Though this I must own, in Justice to her Memory if she had not been imposed on by Persons who now find a large Account of her great Riches, which once I might have expected as mine, and now refuse to pay that small Stipend my dear Aunt was pleas'd to leave me, though now another Persons Right, and who could seize in a lawful and just way, but have been deterred for fear of hurting my Life. The Summer before my dear Aunt dyed, I went to <placeName id="OA17381108-geo-129">

But God bless them and their Riches, for I don't envy them; but I hope my Riches which God Almighty has bestowed on me, thro' the Merits of our Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ, will last for ever. Good Madam, don't be offended that I let the World know both of you and dear Mr. M - s, what pains you have taken to save my Life, besides supporting me in so bountiful a Manner, and not doubting your Charity and extensive Goodness to see me buryed, for I shall be very unwilling to be obliged to Persons to bury me, that would not send me the smallest Relief in this my great Tribulation. Good Madam I must observe to you, that in one of my former Letters of the third of October, it being my unhappy Birth-Day, I wrought you Word, I would keep it with a double Pomp of Sorrow; now this being the third of November, I have kept it with a double Pomp of Joy and Gladness, that God Almighty of his infinite Goodness and Mercy, that he not only keeps me in my Senses, but gives me greater Strength of Mind, and a firmer Resolution than ever I had in my Life; and when the dismal News was first brought, I received it as one that had fought the Battles of the Lord, and as a good Christian should submit to his heavenly Will, tho' so miserable a Sinner. Dear Madam, Mr. M - s having had so much trouble already, I can't beg the Favour of him to go any more either to the Duke of N - e, or the Duke of M - h, though Sunday Night being Council Night, might be of the utmost Consequence; but there is one Favour I must beg, and most humbly hope Mr. M-s will grant, as I know it to be largely in his Power to get an Order from the Sherriffs for my Bdoy, which will be the greatest Means of my dying in Peace; and what a Requient wou'd it be to my departing Soul, if you and Mr. M - s would come and forgive me before I go hence, and be no more seen, you would not find me overwhelm'd with Grief and Tears, but Joy and Glad</p>

If the Countryman consented, they carried him to a House fit for the Design; Raby and W &#8211; I - would follow, and artfully get into Jones's and the Countryman's Company, and when Liquor had gone plentifully about, Cards would be called for, and cutting them for so much Money, or a particular Game, would be proposed, and the Countryman was never left, till he had not a Farthing left in his Pocket, nor any Thing valuable about him.</p>
