But, being acquitted of the Outlawry, as above, he was fixed with a large Debt to the Crown, and by that Means kept in Custody, 'till this Fact was found out against him; which, tho' proved upon him to the Satisfaction of the Court and Jury, he had the Obstinacy to deny being at the Place laid in the Indictment at that Time, as have almost all the Smugglers done, that have been executed. However, when tried upon the Indictment, he had nothing to say for himself, but that the Distance of Time was so great, that he could not remember any thing of the Persons of the Evidence against him, nor could tell what to say for himself; so the Jury found him guilty. He has behaved decently and quietly since convicted, as he did on the Common Side Debtors; being sent there after his being acquitted of the Outlawry, as a Debtor to the Crown, not thinking of another Prosecution for Smuggling, which brought him to the Cells again. From which place when he came forth, the Morning of Execution, he said, he went to Death in Hopes of a better Life after this.</p>

            <p>From that Time, which is for near three Years, he has lived by his Wits, as the common Saying is. And, as the best Part of his Education consisted in his Writing, he has made Use of that Qualification ever since, at the Times he thought proper, for such Purposes as that for which he was convicted; and what was designed to advance him in the World, he has abused to his Ruin.

            <p>His Misfortune was, that he (tho' much mistaken) supposed he could be prosecuted only by the Persons whose Names he made Use of in his forged Draughts; but he found at last that the Acceptors, and Persons who paid the Monies upon such Draughts, had a legal Right to bring him to Justice, which he presumed the others would not do, as he had some Pretensions to Relationship with them. But they, it seems, have no Reason to be sorry that he is brought to Justice, having been a great Plague to them all the Days of his Life.</p>
            <p>He was at last indicted for one of these attempted Impositions on his Friends and the Public. He owed three Guineas to the Prosecutor; and in Order to discharge that Sum, and get the Money into his own Pocket, he brought him a Note of Hand for ten Pounds to discount, the Acceptance whereof was forged, in a Person's Name who had been dead ten Months and five Days before the Time specified therein.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutor paid him the Money on the Note; and it being not then due from the supposed Accepter, Joyce endorsed it. But on the Prosecutor's going to pay it away to a Cheesemonger in Drury-Lane, he discovered the Fraud and secured the Prisoner, who was his Cousin. All his Defence upon Trial was, that the Note was none of his Property, and that he was entirely innocent of its being forged, and offered to rest the Proof of the same on his Character; but that not having been so very good as to induce the Jury to think him innocent, they brought their Verdict against him, and he accordingly suffered Death.</p>

He was kept to School to read and write, but there was no Care afterwards taken to put him Apprentice to any Trade; so that he may be said to have been bred up in Idleness, which is generally speaking the Source of all the many Evils, that by these unhappy Wretches are done under the Sun.

And when he had tried all Methods he could by Land, and none would do, he betook himself to the Sea, entered on Board a Man of War during the late War, and continued in the Service from one Ship to another for eleven Years.</p>

            <p>He was said to be a good Hand on Board a Ship at Sea; but at last the Event of his Deeds has proved that he had a very bad one. Since he left the Sea he pretends he worked in the River Thames, when he could get Employ. This seems only a Pretence; but were it so, as he says, that he did work upon the River, this is a very suspicious Way of Life, such People being generally looked upon as getting more Money by the bye than by their Labour.</p>
            <p>The Fact for which he was convicted, was committed in the Year 1749, and has ever since hung over his Head, which must occasion him to keep out of the Way, as much as he could, for Fear of the Consequence.</p>

            <p>However, 'twas well he was taken, or he might have been a great Nusance to that Road. And the Scheme which he was taken by was no bad one. It was as follows: The Post-Chaise for the Devizes having been robbed several Times, the Owner was likely to lose his Business, and no one chose to go in it. Upon which he thought himself obliged to find out some Expedient to put a Stop to it. Accordingly one Norton was sent to, and undertook to go and take the Person that so frequently molested the Chaise. He set out about half an Hour after One on the third of June last, and when he came to the usual Place, the Chaise was stopt by a Person, who proved to be the poor unfortunate Belcher. He attacked the Chaise, stopt it, and ordered the Passengers to deliver their Money, presenting a Pistol Tinder-box to them. But Norton presently snapt a Pistol at him, which frightend him, and made him take to his Heels. He was soon overtaken by Norton, of whom upon his Knees he begged for Mercy, and was taken without making any Resistance.

Do you consider how dreadful the Consequence of ruining one poor Soul is, much more three. If it were the Lord's Blessed Will to call you hence this Night by sudden Death, and not give you Time to crave Mercy for your poor sinful Soul, how dreadful it is to be feared would be your Case. I bless the supream God, who has granted me Time for a sincere and unseigned Repentance, and, through the Merits of our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, I hope to receive Forgiveness. How often have you told me you made Pretences of Love to the Watchmaker and Baker when your Mother was present, and at the same Time you absolutely hated them both, as you told me, I shall leave you to the wide World, which you may expect to shew you no Favour.</p>

About three Weeks ago, Ward says, he, and Signal, and Branch met, and resolved to go out and commit Street-Robberies together, and have kept their Resolution as long as they could. But falling out among themselves, Branch informed against them, and had them taken up, and committed.</p>

            <p>During Signal's Confinement, there came a poor Man to him, whom he had robbed, and desired him to give an Account of his Things; saying if they were pawned he would release them, for he was almost left bare. Upon this, Signal told him the Places where they were pawned. This I must remark, that the Evidence, who swore against him, threatned several Times to have him taken up, if he would not go along with him. This he told his Father and a Gentleman in my hearing; nevertheless, he desired a Woman to get out of the Way, saying, You foolish Bitch, why don't you get off; for the Thief-Catchers have got a Scent of you, and if you do not, you'll soon come to my Lodging.</p>

Afterwards he got into other Employ in the same Way, by which he is said to have been diligent enough to get his eighteen Shillings per Week, till he unluckily fell into Company with a wicked female Companion, who drew him off from his Business, and brought him to Ruin. He says, he had never any Thought of thieving till he met with her, and kept her Company, and she put him upon it in Order to support her in Idleness.</p>
            <p>Thus he went from his Business, and devoted himself to her Humour, which prompted him on Daily to Acts of Robbery, sometimes picking Pockets, and sometimes House-breaking. Lane and Burgen, and others, that suffered with them, he owned had been often together upon these wicked Schemes; but said, he never was much the better for it, because, whatever he got was thrown away in Debauchery, and nothing being left the next Day, he was always obliged to have Recourse to the same Ways, as often as Opportunity presented, which he and his Companions were not idle in looking after.</p>
            <p>These two poor unhappy Youths were bad enough of their own Inclinations to be sure; but were led into this Burglary, for which they suffered, by the Evidence Hughes, who being as yet somewhat more cunning than they turned Evidence, and got them taken, together with himself; so he slipt the Halter off his own for the present, and fix'd it upon their Necks.</p>

He was but a Boy, though of a robust Stature and Complexion, and of a hardened and daring Disposition. He was too weak of Understanding to think of Danger, till he was overtaken in his Wickedness, and brought to Punishment, which seemed at last to make some Impression and Alteration upon him.</p>

He owned the Justice of his Sentence, and when he saw no Hopes but of Death he began to bewail and lament himself and his miserable Condition, and died with all outward Appearance of Contrition and Sorrow.</p>
