            <p>They having been young Men of a wild extravagant Life, and wicked Conversation, and although some of them might know a little of good Principles, by Virtue of Education, yet altogether ignorant of, and unacquainted with the Practice of Virtue and Goodness, wherein the Life of Religion consists: As I instructed them in the Articles of our Holy Faith, necessary to Salvation, so likewise I shew'd them, that all those Points necessary to be known, in order to Salvation, were intended for the Reformation of our Lives, to restore us unto the Dignity of the divine Native, that we might become Holy as God is Holy, and Blameless in all manner of Conversation, since, without Holiness no Man can see the Lord. I made them to understand, that as Christ came into the World to rectify the Mistakes and corrupt Notions about Religion, which the Jewish Doctors and Rabbi's had propagated, so his great Aim in all these Instructions was to discover unto them wherein they deviated from the Paths of Virtue, and to bring them into the Practice of sincere Piety and Goodness, which is the only way to Happiness; and therefore St. Peter, when preaching to convince Men of the Excellency of our christian Institution, gives this as one of the noblest Epithets of the great Author thereof, who went about doing good: Acts 10. 38. This is one of the signal Characters which Christ bears, that he was constantly imploy'd in doing good to the Souls and Bodies of Men; and in imitation of him, who is the Captain of our Salvation, the Author and Finisher of our Faith, and of those who through Faith and Patience have inherited the Promises; we ought to be constantly employ'd in working Righteousness in exercising ourselves more unto Godliness, which hath Promise of this Life, and that which is to come: For this is the very end of our Creation, that we may glorify God; and by what Means do we glorify God? by working Righteousness and doing good, after the Example of our Blessed Saviour; by exercising our selves to Acts of Justice, Mercy and Compassion; By injuring no Body, but doing good to every one, to the uttermost of our Power; yea, by prosecuting Malice or Revenge against no Person, but freely, and in the Bowels of christian Love, Sympathy and Compassion, forgiving all those who have offended us, as we expect, for the Sake of Christ, Forgiveness at the Hands of a good and merciful God, for the manifold, yea, the innumerable Offences we have committed against him.</p>
            <p>I exhorted them all, however many or great their Sins might have been, to throw themselves upon the infinite Mercies of God in Christ, not to despair of the divine Mercy, but to believe in Christ who died for our Sins, to repent of all their Sins, to resolve upon a new Life, and wholly to resign themselves unto God: And in Token of their Repentance, I advis'd them to partake in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, as a Pledge and Confirmation of all the Benefits of the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>While these and many such Exhortations were given, all of them attended in Chapel, and they who could read made Responses; but most of them seem'd to be very indifferent, and at some times smil'd and spoke to one another, for which I sharply rebuk'd them, after that they behav'd with more Decency. Polson was always very attentive and apparently Penitent, and complain'd frequently upon the Misbehaviour of some of the rest. <persName id="OA17301007n7-1">

Gilburn said, that Wilson gave false Information against him, and also that it was false that he intended to Inform against Wilson, and to prove him Guilty of Murder, for he said, he knew of no such Thing, and that he never spoke so; but some Persons who did their endeavours to induce Wilson to commence Evidence against him to save his own Life. He continued in denying the Fact, for which he died, till he about two Days before he was Executed, then he own'd that he was concern'd in the Robbery, but that he was not the Person who committed it. He confess'd also, that he had been a very wicked Youth in whoring, drinking, thieving, and coveting the Goods of others, but said he never swore much. He inveigh'd much against his Prosecutor, because (as he said) when he saw him first, he said he knew nothing of him, although afterwards he swore to his Face, as also against some Persons who were concern'd in taking him up. I advised him to beware of entertaining Malice against any Body, as he tendered the eternal Welfare of his Soul. He said, he had no grudge to any Person whatsoever.</p>
            <p>He was a well looking young Man, and seem'd to be of a good natural Temper; but was ruin'd by bad Company, both in his own Country, and after he went Abroad.

He own'd, he had been a very wicked, and vicious Youth. Armstrong adher'd to his former Confessions, wept, and made grievous Complaints, and Expostulations. Laurence did not alter in his Confessions, only said that his Prosecutors had no good Will at him, because he would, or could not make One, viz. his Prentice Master of his Trade, in one Year, as well as in 6, or 7 Years.
