About six Years ago he came ashore here in <placeName id="OA17511023-geo-5">

For some Time she kept an honest House, till she was told (as the Neighbours do affirm) that a Rogue's or a Whore's Money was as good as an honest Person's; and that this Advice was given her by the Person who now keeps the same House. Brown and this Woman used frequently to walk Abroad together, and he now commenced an idle Life, and took to little pilfering Ways, and picking of Pockets. The Woman dying about three Years ago, and her Husband having an Information for selling Gin lodged against him, let the House at Christmas, 1748, to one Capt. Tom, with whom Brown remained. This Man throve so by entertaining all Comers, that from nothing, he was able, in less than one Year's Time from his being Landlord, to lay out near 50 l. in a Law-suit. He grew remarkably fond of Brown, and kept him entirely; and they two were generally, if not always Bedfellows: A Thing the more extraordinary, as the Landlord's Bulk seems to require a large Bed to himself; and this was carried on so long, that Brown was generally called by the Neighbourhood the Landlord's Wife.</p>
            <p>Brown lived in the House in which had been lodg'd three poor Boys, Ross, Long, and Proctor, who, in December Sessions last, were condemned and executed for the Highway; at which Trial the Character of the House was fully established, and it appeared to be a Nest of the worst and naughtiest People that any one can suppose to be in one House. The Neighbours in general assert it to be a Rendezvous for about a Dozen notorious Whores and common Prostitutes; and the opposite Neighbours have declared, that they have seen the Boys and Jades together in the Rooms in Swarms; Boys from 12 to 15 Years of Age.</p>
            <p>Brown has followed Gambling from his Infancy almost, and the Reason of his continuing at Pegg's House, was as follows: He says, when he came Home from Sea, he lent her all his Wages, which was three Guineas, and she being unable to repay him, he was to have his Board with her in Lieu of it. Here he lived an idle Life, and the mix'd Company in the House did not improve his Morals, if he might be supposed to have any.</p>

The Man who afterwards became his Landlord was very fond of Brown, ('tis an odd Expression, but it seems too true) and always dissuaded him from going a robbing, and would have kept him entirely without letting him work or thieve. But about Michaelmas 1750, Brown was taken on Suspicion, by a Marshall Court Officer, and charged with being concerned in several Robberies, and being one of those who gave Mr. Emmes several Blows at his own Door on the Head with Bludgeons, of which he in a few Days died: For which being committed to <placeName id="OA17511023-geo-7">

            <p>His quondam Landlord fearing Brown should be hanged, sent him away for awhile into the Country, and supplied him with Money.

            After this, his quondam Landlord, who called him Son, as he did him Father, it seems, supplied Brown with Money enough to keep him from robbing; but he hating Confinement, and getting among his old Associates, followed his old Practices, and eloped from his Father, as he called his quondam Landlord. After this, as if he was infatuated, he gets into Company with some Thief-takers, and tells them what Robberies he had committed with one Bunk, by Nickname, who was gone into the Country. They took Bunk first, and immediately Brown was taken by them, being in Bed with his Father, as he called his Landlord; who has since supported him in Gaol, and was so fond of him, to declare he would spare a hundred Pounds to save him. And he did continue to buoy the poor Wretch up with Hopes, almost to the last, that he might not divulge any Thing to the Prejudice of his Reputation, who has had the Assurance to declare, he never did any Thing amiss. However, Brown was doubtless naturally of a very bad Disposition, prone to Wickedness, nay, fond of it. He was suspected to have been guilty of several Murders; but of these he protested his Innocence, And no Wonder he should be suspected, having been known for a long while to be a bad Man, desperate, and fit for any Mischief; and was always the foremost in every Attack. He was concerned in divers Robberies with

            <p>One Vincent was also convicted upon his Evidence, the same Sessions, and suffered accordingly, for robbing

The Reader perhaps will be at a Loss to think what should induce him to this Piece of odd Behaviour; but this is to be accounted for from his Acquaintance with his Landlord mentioned above, in whose Company and Conversation, 'tis generally agreed, he has learned worse, and more abominable Practices, which that might be only introductory to. After all this, he presented his Pistol again to Bright, and swore again bitterly, if he stirr'd till they were out of Sight he'd blow his Brains out. And now,</p>

            <p>And this Fellow was so mad, as to run headlong into a Net, which had long been spread for him. He betakes himself to the Company of Thief-takers, as before observed, and intending to be an Evidence against Holmes, he sends them after him; but Holmes telling them of this Robbery, turn'd the Tables upon him, and Brown being taken, was convicted upon his Evidence. He always appeared of a sullen, morose Disposition, and was not without some Difficulty brought to any Sense of his past mispent Life. Till the Warrant for Execution came down, he was scarce at all concern'd about the Matter; but then began to be a little more serious, and tothink of dying. Tho' he had so many Escapes by being admitted an Evidence against others, who perhaps had not so richly deserved it as himself, and had seen them executed, yet did he entertain Hopes against all that might to the contrary be said to him. When he found no Hopes left, he began to recant, and to own his wicked Practices in the general. He had run a long Course of Villainy in few Years, and Providence thought fit that he should now be cut off.</p>

After he came Home he drew 15 l. out of the 100, which having squandered away in an idle and dissolute Manner, he was reduced to the utmost Straits and Necessity; and tho' he had been thus foolish, and run headlong to his own Ruin, yet there seemed to be a Softness of Nature in him, which, properly managed in his early Days, might have fitted him for a better Fate.</p>

He did not deny taking the Things, but the Manner of taking; and said several Times, that he relented not so much at his Fate, as that the Evidence did not share it with him.</p>

He staid not long in that Employment, but whether the want of Inclination to Labour, or the ill Treatment he pretended to meet with from his Master, was the Cause of deserting him, the Event shews, 'twere better he had staid where he was, and laboured ever so hard, rather than by coming away from his Master, to run the Risque of his Life: For if to avoid the Chastisements, (which his Idleness and want of Application to Business might but too often have merited) he left his Service, he had made no desireable Exchange, since being his own Master has work'd his Ruin.</p>
            <p>After this he associated with all the vagabond idle Crew he could meet with like himself, being of a surly Disposition, and profligate Manners: He took up with all the little filching and pilfering Arts that came in his Way; and, from picking of Pockets, went on by Degrees to House-Breaking and Street-Robbery.</p>
            <p>He said he was initiated into these villanous Practices, by two Men famous for these Things, whose Names however he could not recollect. With them he was taken in order to break open a House, which was effected by thrusting this little unhappy Wretch into the Kitchen Window, who, coming up to the Street-Door, by Assistance of a Dark-Lanthorn, provided for that Purpose, open'd the same for his Companions, who were much bigger than he was. They rumaged the Rooms in the lower Apartments, and took Plate, Linen, &amp;c. to a considerable Value, and made of undiscovered. He was but young in Years, tho' old in Wickedness, ignorant almost to Insensibility, and scarce capable of being taught what a State hereafter might mean, wherein an Account was to be given for the Things done in this Life in Provocation of the Almighty: And, the only Thing I ever heard come from him, to distinguish him from the Beasts that perish, was, after a deal of talking to him, concerning the Nature of these Things, he said, he hoped God would forgive him.</p>

Accordingly he got recommended to a Service, where he behaved to Satisfaction; but this Master dying, he was recommended to another Family, in which he remained to Content for about four Years in his own native Country, and then it came into his Head to come up to <placeName id="OA17511023-geo-19">

            <p>As he appeared to be a Youth of a gentle and tractable Disposition, and very obliging in his Behaviour, he did not long want Employ in the Way of Life he had chosen; and, he says, he at Times lived with many good Masters, Men of Fortune and Figure in the World. And as (according to his own Account of himself) he had the Opportunity of living in the Service of so many reputable Families, if he had not then behaved well, 'tis scarce to be supposed he would have met with so much Countenance in so good Employ as he represents himself to have been in. But there is a Time when every one that is so, begins to be wicked. And, the first Robbery he committed, was when he lived in Quality of a <rs id="OA17511023-occupation-17" type="occupation">Postilion</rs>

The Gentleman, not prepared for such a sudden Attack, was obliged to comply, and he went off with his Booty. This Course of Life he followed for three Years, every now and then taking a Purse, &amp;c. which was the Time he continued in the Service. And, he managed Affairs so, as to escape all Suspicion; and might have remained unsuspected, had it not been for an Intrigue discovered with a Maid Servant, which occasioned his going from this Service. However, he got a Recommendation, and got into another considerable Family, where he lived for some Time, enjoying all the Felicity a Person in his Station could expect. And a Man can scarce think that he turned Thief and Highway Robber for the Pleasure of Stealing only, for he was in no Necessity: No, 'twas to support the Extravagance of himself, and a Mistress, that led him to run these Lengths; a Case said to be too common in these Days, even among the lower Class of Men. Another Time, in the Dusk of the Evening, he attacked two Gentlemen in <placeName id="OA17511023-geo-21">

It seems he was always very cautious in Time of Action, and robbed masked, having Changes of Cloaths suited to these Occasions; and, while he kept this Place, committed diverse Robberies about and in Town, both on Horse and on Foot.</p>
            <p>He once made an Attempt (so daring was he) upon an Officer of the Guards, who, he says, used frequently to ride out for the Benefit of the Air. Meeting him one Summer's Morning, very early, on the Road to Hampstead, he attacked him, and bid him deliver. But his Menaces had not the intended Effect, for he was obliged to sheer off, and rely upon the Goodness of his Horse.</p>
            <p>Soon after this he left this Place, and had the good Luck to get another as good, where he lived some Time: Nor yet he could not help doing the same Things now and then, but he followed it still; the Itch was so rooted in him, that he could not get rid of it. And, for 7 or 8 Years at least, he has thus, at Times, infested the Roads. At last the Fire began to take Air, and to blaze Abroad; and he left off seeking after Gentlemen's Service, and took to driving Jobbs, as he call'd it; that is, when Coaches, &amp;c. were hired to any Part of England, which his Master, whom he last served, kept for such Purposes, and says, he did behave with Faithfulness in this Trust.</p>

            <p>As to the Fact of the Murder, he confessed it, with all its aggravating Circumstances, and begg'd to know what he should do, being under the most dreadful Horrors, upon Account that he had taken away the Life of his poor Wife, even in the Midst of her Sins; which he fear'd he must answer for, besides the Number and Weight of his own. He seemed, whenever I talk'd to him, to be sensible of the Barbarity and Baseness of perpetrating so very rash an Act; but could give no other Reason for it, but that he was in Liquor, and knew not what he did. As to what was sworn concerning his saying that God had been very good to him that he had not done it before, and that she had got the Length of it, (meaning the Knife;) he did not pretend to say but that it might be so said by him; but that he had no Remembrance of any such Expressions, only from hearing them repeated by the Evidences.</p>

Upon this, he apprehended that he came Home to her to get some more, but she refusing to give him any, and upbraiding him for staying out, &amp;c. Words arose, and hisReason being drown'd in Drink, his Passion hurried him on to the horrid Act.</p>
            <p>He lamented, and wept sometimes bitterly, and always appeared to be very penitent and sorry for what he had done: He frequently expressed his Fear how he should be able to answer for his own, much less for the Sins of her, whom he had cut off in the Midst of her Wickedness; which he was in his own Mind perswaded would lie at his Door. He said he ceased not, Day or Night, when awake, to beg of God that his Repentance might find a Way to escape the Punishment eternal, which his Crime had deserved, unless the Merits of Christ should propitiate the God of Heaven to be merciful to him; in whom alone, from the Time of being sensible of his Crimes, he had put his whole Trust and Confidence.</p>

For one Year he continued with him, and was then recommended to the Service of a Gentleman, with whom he lived till apprehended for the Robbery for which he suffered. He says, he never wrong'd his Master of a Halfpenny, tho' he had great Opportunity, and he might have been honest to all the World, and lived comfortably, had he not also had the exorbitant Demands of a Mistress to satisfy.</p>
            <p>This unhappy Youth being by Birth of a reputable Family, and looking upon himself to be born a Gentleman, was so unhappy as to think, that tho' a <rs id="OA17511023-occupation-23" type="occupation">Servant</rs>
               <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                     targets="OA17511023n60-1 OA17511023-occupation-23"/>, he must live like a Gentleman; and accordingly, as his Master was pretty much in the Country, and he left in Town upon Board-Wages, he had Opportunity of following all the publick Diversions and Follies of the Town. And his Resolution of putting on the Gentleman's Appearance with a Servant's Pocket, led him into all the Intrigues, and unfortunate Adventures, which have work'd his Ruin.</p>
            <p>He met with all the Encouragement in his Service, that any one could expect, his Master being willing to do the best he could for him in regard to his Family: And, he might have supported himself in a very decent Manner, but he frequented Houses of ill Fame and Gaming, and grew quite profligate in secret, tho' so artfully as not to draw the least Suspicion from those who knew him in Quality of a Gentleman's Servant. To provide for his Mistress was the grand Difficulty he laboured under; for which Purpose he was forc'd to pawn or sell every Thing he had, even to his wearing Apparel, and as soon as the Produce of that was lavish'd away, the next Thing was to try his Fortune on the Highway.</p>
            <p>The better to qualify himself for putting this Scheme into Execution, he procured himself a Pair of Pistols, and a genteel riding Frock, which he deposited in the Hands of a Person he was persuaded would not deceive him. The next Thing was to get himself recommended to the Master of an Inn; for which Purpose, he found a Friend, who represented him as a good Customer, and a Gentleman, that would pay well, and not abuse the Horses, provided he was supplied with good Cattle.</p>
            <p>Things being thus far settled, without farther Consideration, he takes the Road on a Sunday Morning early, and set out towards Windsor. About a Mile on this Side of <placeName id="OA17511023-geo-38">

Then, without further Ceremony, he told the Company in the Chaise, that he was a young Adventurer, who wanted Money, presenting his Pistol, and ordering them to deliver their Money, and the Gentleman and Lady were obliged to hand him their Purses, and a Watch, which he rode off with full Speed.</p>

He then cross'd the Country, and kept off the Road for a Day or two; but returning to it again about six Miles on this Side of Windsor, he met with a single Gentleman in an open Field, from whom he took a considerable Sum, and his Watch, and then made the best of his Way for Staines. There he staid for a while, and refreshed himself, and his Horse, and by the Way robb'd several Persons before he came to Town, undiscovered. In this Expedition he was a considerable Gainer, and brought Home good Booty, which gain'd him a kind Reception with his Mistress.</p>
            <p>But this would not last for ever, and he must turn out for more when that was gone. He did so several Times after, and met with Success: And in his Time near twenty Robberies he had committed, if not more, e'er that fatal Afternoon in which he was taken. The Robbery for which he suffered was plainly proved upon him, and he could not but acknowledge the Justice of his Sentence. He behaved very well under Sentence of Death, and seem'd to be a Youth of a Disposition quite easy and calm, and the very Reverse of what might be expected in Persons that commit such Villainies, as render it unsafe for a Man to travel almost at Noon-day upon the Highway upon his lawfull Calling and Occasion.</p>

             was taken in April last, and admitted Evidence against Ward. He gave Account of many Robberies, and by whom committed. But as none have been tried since upon his Information, there's Reason to doubt of the Truth of it. As 'tis notoriously known in these Cases, when a Fellow is in this Wickedness, he'll inform perhaps against one, whom he entertains a Grudge against, and pretend to do so against many others, in order to get off himself, and put in Names that occur to his Mind; but these did not serve his Turn: For, tho' he did convict Ward upon this Evidence, yet as he had not given Information of this Burglary, for which himself was convicted, and as the Prosecutor was then Abroad, some Persons thought fit to detain him still in Gaol till he should return from his Voyage, to prosecute and get a Bill of Indictment found; which was accordingly done at the Sessions in September last, and Robertson was convicted upon full Evidence, and suffered very deservedly.</p>
            <p>His Behaviour after Conviction was very unbecoming a Wretch in his unhappy Circumstances, appearing always with a surly, morose, and impudent Aspect; and tho' he did attend Chapel, as usually is done in such Case, unless hindered by Sickness, &amp;c. yet with Difficulty was he brought to behave soberly, even when come into the more immediate Presence of the Almighty, under Pretence of seeking Pardon for his Crimes. No Admonitions could perswade, nor any Threats affright him; he was invincibly bent upon Wickedness, and, as far as he could, he pursued it to the last.</p>
            <p>A little while after Conviction, he threaten'd one of the People that look'd after them, because he would not suffer him to do as he pleased, and went so far as to threaten his Life, so that the Man dare no more go near him; upon which he was ordered to be lock'd to the Floor: He was so served, and it had some Effect for the present, and made him relent. But, What was the Consequence of his being let loose from that close Confinement? Why, he appear'd with as great, if not greater Hardness than before.</p>
            <p>If reproved for ill Behaviour, he'd say, he behaved as well as others, and attended as well to Prayers, and what else was said to him; but those that saw him were persuaded to the contrary. Having so long been habituated to all Manner of Wickedness, 'twas impossible for all the Advice in the World to make any Impression, and nothing but the Sight of the Gallows could strike an Awe into him.</p>

But when he came to the fatal Place, he grew pale and stood aghast, and great Horrors indeed he seemed to be affected with. A wretched Miscreant indeed! And, but that the Mercies of God we can set no Bounds to, being infinite, and unlimited, otherwise what Hopes could any one entertain of a Wretch that could shew such Behaviour in his last Moments?</p>

            The Celebrated Dr. BOERHAAVE'S Antiscorbutick PILLS.</p>
            <p>FOR curing the most violent Scorbutick Disorder, by an easy gentle Operation by Stool and Urine, which are so innocent and safe, that they may be taken at any Age, requiring no Confinement or Restraint in the Manner of Living.</p>
            <p>They are faithfully prepared from a Prescription which the Doctor, after several Days Consideration, gave the Maker of them, as a most effectual Remedy for an old inveterate Scurvy, which had appeared in many Ways. Their good Effects have since been experienced in many other Instances.</p>
            <p>The Doctor recommended them in the following Cases, which he said were only different Effects of a violent scorbutick Habit, that had ceased appearing on the Skin, viz. in extreme Lowness of Spirits, so as to occasion an Inactivity of the whole Body; Heaviness in the Head, accompanied with Pain; frequent Dryness and unsavoury Taste in the Mouth; Oppression of the Breast and Stomach, attended with Want of Appetite; a Loathing of Food, Indigestion and flying Pains like Stitches, with an outward Coldness of the Breast and Stomach; swelling of the Knees, Legs, and Feet, accompanied with Pain and Inflammation; an uneasy Fulness of the Body, Costiveness, and Wind: In these Cases the Doctor particularly ordered these Pills as the best Remedy. They are also good in hysterical Disorders, and very effectual in clearing the Head from a confused Stupor and Gloominess; are excellent for Disorders incident to young Women, but not proper for Women with Child; but may be used with great Safety and Success in all Cases which appear to be scorbutick, or really proceed from the Scurvy.</p>
            <p>These Pill are sold in London only, at Mr. <persName id="OA17511023n99-1">
