            <p>The first Thing he did, having resolved to be wicked, he says, was this. As he was going over a large Common one Day, he observed some lean Cattle at some Distance from any House, and thought within himself to drive off some of them. But being Pennyless, and fearing lest he should starve, or faint by the Way, as he drove them to a convenient Distance in order for Sale, he went into a neighbouring Village, and took up the Trade of <rs id="OA17520427-occupation-12" type="occupation">begging</rs>

            <p>He went on with them for some Days, till he came into his own Country. The Cattle he let feed now and then upon a waste Ground, and little Refreshment served himself, till he got into his own Neighbourhood. There he told the People he had been abroad to buy them for his Father, and was going to put them into some Meadows he rented about three Miles from his House. Accordingly he did so, and then went home to his Father, telling him he had got into Service in <placeName id="OA17520427-geo-10">

His Father, poor Man, was glad to find him provided with a Service, which the Son spoke of as a very good one, and being furnished with what Money his Father could spare (never speaking a Word of the Cattle) in three or four Days he took his Leave, and went off.</p>
            <p>By this Time he was pretty well refreshed, and his Cattle had filled their Bellies, and all were fit for a March. He had well tim'd the Matter too; for it happened there was a Fair for Cattle not far off, and there he drove them. As the Neighbours knew his Father kept a little Farm, and now and then sold Cattle, he was not suspected, and sold his Bargain at a good Rate, as Part of his Father's Stock.</p>
            <p>As soon as he had done this, he went up and down the Country in an idle Manner, drinking and rioting, like a Prodigal Son, till he had consumed all he had. He then <rs id="OA17520427-occupation-13" type="occupation">stole a Horse</rs>

            <p> Various are the Robberies of this Sort, which he has committed up and down the Countries where-ever he came; so many, that himself could not recount them all. For five Years past, he says, this has been his Way of Life, which at last he ended in a most miserable Manner; not only as to the Death he suffered, which he confessed he had long deserved; but Providence was pleased sorely to afflict him here with Diseases, while living, so that he was but just alive when he went to suffer Death. He all along, after Conviction, appeared very penitent, and seemed to die so.</p>

After Conviction, he behaved very quietly, but when interrogated, he denied the Fact, and every Part of it. It surprized me, I must needs say, at first, but considering he might think his owning the Fact might put a Stop to all Hopes of getting off, after giving him all the Reasons I could, to shew, that the World was satisfied with the Verdict, I desisted for the present.</p>

When he became somewhat better, I asked him again of this Matter, and repeated it every Day; but he always denied the Fact, as upon his Defence he did, and said he never saw the Woman before she came to the White-Hart Inn. The same he continued to say the Evening before, in Presence of an Acquaintance of his, who was with me in his Cell, and so on the very Morning of Execution. But, as the Evidence, upon which he was convicted, was so connected, 'tis to be feared he stifled the Truth, and died a hardened Wretch, though scarce alive when he came to suffer. For,</p>

The Woman of the Queen's Head swore he drank there a Quarter before Eight in the Evening of the 28th of March, and about Eight the Fact is alledged to have been done. And as the Distance from the Queen's Head, to the Place where the Fact was done; is very trifling, and the Circumstances of the whole Evidence so connected, who can dispute the Justness of his Suffering, notwithstanding his Obstinacy in denying of the Fact to the last? The Mercies of God are indeed infinite; we can set no Bounds to them: But if any Thing can be a Bar to Hopes of Forgiveness, certainly such Behaviour must! Christian Charity engages to wish well to all; but yet, if to the contrite, and the obstinate Sinner, the Case is the same, what becomes of the Difference between Virtue and Vice?</p>

If he had not been so before,he now began to grow loose, and keep such Company as has brought him to Ruin. He had begun, and gone on some Time in the Road to Destruction, before his Parents knew any Thing of the Matter, because before them he was so well acquainted with Policy, as to behave decently before them, and they gave him Encouragement accordingly. In the Neighbourhood too, he was for some Time respected, while he behaved like a sober, honest Man.</p>
            <p>But he was now engaged in such Practices, as could not long be hid. His Parents hearing bad Report of him, took him to Task, and gave him such Lectures and Admonitions to dissuade him from pursuing evil Courses, as were in the Reach of their Understanding. He gave them the Hearing, and promised fair, but as surely broke thro' his Engagements to them. What should they do? Their Hearts had daily Achings for him, but all they could say or do to him, was to no Purpose.

            <p>He says, he happened to meet with Hall accidentally in the Easter Holidays, and, as the Custom is, they drank together.

This Circumstance was recollected after the Man was buried. Some Persons had some Snspicions of the Farmer's Son, as he was to inherit the Estate.

When the Villain was before the Justice, he was search'd, and he had then about six and twenty Shillings in his Pocket; and on examining his Knife and Sheath, it appeared that the Inside of the Sheath was bloody, and a little dried Blood was at the Bottom of the Sheath. The Justice asked him how the Inside of the Sheath became so bloody? He answered, that he had lent it his Father to kill his Hog. The Father was then called in, and the Son turned out; and being examined about his Manner of getting his Livelihood, was asked whether he fatted a Hog, and who killed the Hog? Replied, that he did every Year kill a Hog, and he always killed the Hog himself, and denied the borrowing a Knife; and said the Blacksmith, of whom he rented his House, gave him a Knife for that Purpose, and he never made use of any other. When he came to Gaol, and the Turnkey had fetter'd him, and was locking him up, he cried, and owned that he was guilty of the Fact for which he was committed. Soon after he sent a Letter to his Father by a Man of Wantage, who was discharged out of Prison for Debt; which Letter was intercepted and copied before it went to the Father. In that Letter Salisbury desired the Father to procure a Friend to swear where he had the Nine Shilling Piece, and to take Care to keep the Cloaths in the Coffer out of Sight. A Warrant was obtained, and the Father's House was searched, in which the Cloaths were found; but they had been wash'd, tho' there were some Stains in several Places, as of Blood. A Message was then sent to Mr. Wiseman, the Keeper of Reading Gaol, to desire him to search every Parcel which should be directed to the Prisoner Salisbury. In a few Days after Mr. Wiseman search'd a little Bag, sent by the Father, with a Piece of Bacon, and some Flower and Sewet, and found a Letter in it, in which the Father tells him, 'twould not be possible to procure a Friend to swear about the Nine Shilling Piece, and desired him to endeavour to make his Peace with God.</p>

The Debtor discharged out of Prison, proved that he had the Letter from Salisbury to the Father, about procuring a Friend to swear, where he had the Nine-shilling Piece, and to hide the Cloaths in the Coffer, Mr. Wiseman proved the Letter from the Father to Salisbury, concealed in the Bag of Flower; and notwithstanding all these strong Circumstances, the Verdict was, Not guilty, to the great Surprize and Astonishment of the whole Country.

He sat there a While, he says, and talked with the Man that had the Care of the Gate. Then, he says, the Devil put it into his Head (it is his own Words) to behave in the vile Manner he did: And he gave no other Reason for such his Behaviour, than that it came into his Head of a sudden, and he was in Liquor at that Time.

            <p>When they heard the Account of his robbing Mr. Thompson, and attempting to murder him, they were glad to find that he had not compleated his Villainy, and that he was apprehended. In a few Days after he was committed, he sent a Letter to his Father, wherein (to use his own Words) he tells him,</p>
            <p>"That he was confined in the Gatehouse,</p>
            <p>"and that he should never be</p>
            <p>"released, and that he should be sentenced</p>

            <p>"his Father and Mother not to</p>
            <p>"grieve about it, and not to come</p>
            <p>"up; for it was what pleased God.</p>
            <p>This Letter was opened and copied, and then sent to the Father, who is generally esteemed a bad Man; for that on the Trial, he swore quite contrary about the borrowing his Son's Knife, to what he did before the Justice.</p>
            <p>Upon his Trial he made no Defence, being convicted in his own Mind, as appears by a Letter he sent his Father, after he was committed for the Fact as above. Since Conviction he has behaved well, as became him, and appeared penitent, and heartily sorry for his great Load of Offences.</p>

And (Oh, dreadfull) as he was walking by his Side, without a Word spoken on either Side, he took a Knife out of his Pocket, and cut his Throat: Upon which he fell directly; and Salisbury says, he afterwards robbed him of about 50 s. in which was included the Nine Shilling Piece. And he declared, he took no more, to the best of his Remembrance. After this monstrous Act committed, he was, however, artful enough to return to <placeName id="OA17520427-geo-74">

            <p>The Law he escaped, but himself remained, from whom he could not run away. Wickedness was some how or other deeply rivetted in his Breast; and he could not shake it off, till it had brought forth its Consequences, severe Punishment.</p>
            <p>He begun with Murder notorious, and ended with an Attempt to do what Providence hath not permitted. And the latter seems to have been attempted, that the former might be brought to Light, and punished by Way of Example, that other Men may remember; - It rarely happens, that a Man who will dare to be wicked, does escape, tho' Punishment may not immediately tread upon his Heels. He suffered very deservedly, and to the Satisfaction of all to whom his Wickedness is known.</p>
