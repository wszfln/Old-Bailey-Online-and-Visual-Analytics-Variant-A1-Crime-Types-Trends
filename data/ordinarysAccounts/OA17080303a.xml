            <p>On the Lord's Day following I Preach'd to them twice, in order to prepare them for another World, and took the Portion of Scripture for my Text, from the 28th Chapter of Proverbs, and the 13th Verse. He that covereth his Sins shall not Prosper, but whosoever forsaketh them shall have Mercy.</p>
            <p>In handling them, I</p>
            <p>I. Explain'd the Nature of Sin, and the Guilt Contracted by it.</p>
            <p>II. I enter'd into the Consequences that attended it and prov'd from Holy Writ, that the Sinner  Ignominious in this Life, and Eternally Miserable without due Repentance in the next; an tho' he may flourish like a Bay-Tree, in his Tem</p>

            <p>poral Concerns, he is lost to all Eternity in his Spiritual, without petitioning for Mercy, and preparing himself with an Humble and Contrite Heart, for the acceptance of it.</p>
            <p>III. Having shewn them what Sin was, and represented it to them in its blackest Colours, I shew'd them what it was to forsake it, what Methods they ought to take for so Holy a Purpose; and what an Abhorrence they should entertain of so Detestable a thing as offending the great Governour of all things; The Creator of Heaven and Earth, by Wicked and Ungodly Practices.</p>
            <p>IV, and Lastly, I applied the Consolation and Mercy to them, and dwelt some time upon the Conditions by which they were to expect it, and exhorted them to forsake Sin, by a Repentance not to be Repented of, by an open and hearty Confession of their Manifold Wickednesses, by a Discovery of such as had been Confederates with them, and by Imploring the Pardon of that God whose Mercy is over all his Works, and is sure to such as seek it according to the prescribed Methods in his Holy Word, &amp;c.</p>
