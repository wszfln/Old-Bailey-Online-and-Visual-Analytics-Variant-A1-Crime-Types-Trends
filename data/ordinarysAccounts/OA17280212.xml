            <p>While under Sentence, they, having been for the most part young Men of lewd and dissolute Lives, and consequently ignorant of Religion, both in Speculation and Practice, were instructed in those Principles, which are necessary to be known, for the Conduct of our Lives as Men and Christians. I show'd them, that Nature itself teacheth us, that unto God the Sovereign Lord of the Universe, Worship, Reverence and Homage is due from all his Creatures, and that Man, (who has the Heathens who were only led by the Light of Nature acknowledg'd) was form'd after the Divine Image, and Substituted Lord of this inferior Orb, was in a more especially Manner bound, in Token of his Dependence, to give all due Obedience, by dedicating himself to the Service of God his Creator and special Benefactor. But if they fell short in complying with the first Principles of natural Religion, which is insufficient for Salvation; how much greater must their guilt be, who being deseas'd of Christian Parents, and living in the Middle of so great Light, had despis'd those glorious Revelations which were intended to elevate and perfect our deprav'd Nature? I explain'd to them the greatness and dangerous Consequence of those particular Sins for which they suffer'd. That Theft and Robbery were destructive of all human Society, and reduc'd Man, who is made the Image of God, and who is the God of Order, into the State of Savage Animals and Birds of Prey: Besides the Consecration of the Sin of Theft and Robbery with innumerable other the worst of Sins; such as, a Tendency to Murder, and commonly, a continued Practice of Lying, Drinking, Whoreing, &amp;c. These who give themselves up to such a wicked Course of Life, being vile Wretches a bandon'd to every thing which is good.</p>

            <p>I instructed 'em in the nature of the Christian Sacraments, particularly, that the Lord's Supper, as a proper Viaticum to strengthen your Faith, in order to prepare them for a new State of Life, and that endless Eternity, upon which they were to enter.</p>
            <p>While these and many such like Exhortations, were given them, they were all attentive and seem'd to comply with the Prayers, altho' not with that Seriousness and Concern which was requisite. <persName id="OA17280212n8-1">

He was an audacious Fellow, and too fit for the desperately Exploits he took in Hand. He own'd himself to have follow'd it 18 Years, chiefly employ'd in picking-pockets, stealing and robbing, and that he had been a Fellow of a most lewd and disorderly Life, having been guilty not only of the four Facts for which he was convicted, but so many others, that it was not possible for his Memory to recollect them; and when he was not out upon Purchase, spent his remaining Hours in Whoring, Drinking, Cursing, and Blaspheming, and all manner of Excess of Riot. He said, that he did his Duty in the Man of War to the Satisfaction of his Officers, and equal to any Sailor in the Ship, but he could not keep himself to any settl'd State of Life, but lov'd best to be upon the Ramble, for although he was naturally of a quick Understanding, yet he employ'd his naturally Endowments to nothing but the worst of Purposes.</p>
            <p>I exhorted him to Repent sincerely of his Sins, and particularly to those henious ones, continued in for such a long Tract of time, which had render'd him odious to God, and detested by all good Men. Having been so desperately wicked, although he knew other things pretty well, yet he knew but little in religious Matters, therefore I exhorted him in many Words to believe in Christ our Saviour; I instructed him in the general Design of the Christian Sacraments, that he should wean his Affections from this World, to which he had been wholly addicted, and settle them on the Things above, where Christ sits at the Right Hand of God, he should employ the remainder of his Time in loving and serving God, and in seeking his Grace to enable him to Work out his Salvation with Fear and Trembling; I also told him, that as in the first Place, he must make up his Peace with God, so also he must be at Peace with all the World; he turn'd very Bad upon some Discontent or Anger he had receiv'd, yet he never staid from Chappel but once; some Days before he Dy'd, being fully Recover'd of his Health, he appear'd with great Devotion at Prayers and other Duties. He declar'd himself a true Penitent having been one of the greatest of Sinners, that he believ'd to be sav'd only through the Merits of Jesus Christ, and that he died in Peace with all Mankind.</p>

And said, that he always liv'd Soberly and work most Laboriously for his Family; that the Son, of whose Murder he was Convicted, was of a first Marriage, and turn'd most Extravagant in wicked Courses of any Boy of his Age; for some Weeks before he Died, staying out Night after Night, and sometimes coming Home in the greatest Disorder imaginable; adding that</p>

            <p>he beg'd, or got Money from People and bought Gin with it, drinking till he appear'd worse than a Beast, quite out of his Senses; and that he was a most notorious Lyar, and withal, that he was of an obstinate Temper, and Disobedient to his Parents. Upon these, and such like Accounts, he was forc'd to use the Rod of Correction against him in an extraordinary Manner, and for that purpose, prepar'd a Cat of Nine-Tails for his Chastisement, as not being in any Danger of breaking Bones. I told him, that he had certainly been too Severe upon the Boy, and that gentler Methods might have been more proper for reducing him; the way of Correction he us'd, being the Punishment inflicted upon Men of Age and Strength, on Board of Ships. He said, that he never intended harm, but only to reclaim him (if possible) from his wild Courses; and that any excessive Correction was given him, proceeded from the Instigation of his Wife, Mother-in-Law to the Deceas'd, who (it seems) did not Love the Child, and for the spite she bore him lost her Husband, and Ruin'd her Family. He reflected upon the Witnesses, as not having Sworn true, in the Points of Fact, for which he was Convicted; particularly, that he did not Kick nor Strike the Child down, either below, or as he was coming up Stairs, and that he did not stamp upon his Head with his Foot in the Room. He believ'd, he had treated the Child too Severely, by Advice of his Wife, without any Malice or Thought of wronging him. I told him, how Barbarous it was to beat the Child, till his Arms and parts of his Body were in a manner Corrupted with the Blows, when he saw him Indispos'd, and scarce able to rise from the Bed. He said, that he was so Sullen as not to tell him that he was Bad, and that he knew nothing of it. Upon the whole, he acknowledg'd that he had been Cruel in his Chastisements; that he remember'd not his Kicking him on the Head with his Foot, which was the immediate Cause of his Death; he could not deny but that the Evidence had Sworn the Truth; only but said, he had never corrected the Child but three Times in an extraordinary Manner, but that whatever Misfortunes happen'd, he had no Evil Intention. I exhorted him to Repent of all his Sins, and particularly, that unnatural and brutish Sin of killing his own Child. He appear'd to have been a very Ignorant, illeterate Fellow, and, as appears from the usuage of his Child, of a Cruel, brutish Temper. He complain'd upon his Wifes going into the Country, and doing nothing for him, after she had expos'd herself and two young Children to the greatest Hardships, by her foolish and inconsiderate Advice. He declar'd himself truely Penitent for all his Sins, particularly the great Misfortune of Murdering his Son; that he believ'd in Christ his only Saviour, and Died in Peace with all the World.</p>
