After he was taken Home, he was sent to work at <rs id="OA17500326-occupation-27" type="occupation">making of Bricks</rs>

He says, as far as he knows, they were but in very indifferent Circumstances, and by their Behaviour he found, after some Time, that he being burthen-some to them, must betake himself to some other Way of Life for Maintenance and Support, for that they began to behave to him in a very cool Manner.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, though but very young, he had Resolution and Resentment enough to take himself away from their Presence, and was some Time in Doubt, being now quite left to himself, to what Way of Life to betake himself. He found no-body would employ him without Recommendation and Interest, and of that he was entirely destitute, having no Friends that could be of Use to him. In this Situation, as an Orphan, though Parents living, he was obliged to fix for himself upon some Employ to get his Livelihood by in an honest Way, and at last he resolved on a Sea-faring Life. For 15 Years past he has been a <rs id="OA17500326-occupation-28" type="occupation">Seaman</rs>

            <p>After the Conclusion of the Peace he was out of Service, and as Seamen generally do when they come to be on Shore, he was willing to make himself Amends for the Hardships he had endured at Sea from Winds and Weather, &amp;c. And now he had got into Quarters, where he found he might have Meat, Drink, and all Necessaries for the present, to be sure not without a View to recompense, tho' the Indulgers knew not what particular Time, or how long before that Time came. At length their Patience began to be tired, and he not receiving his Money, could not satisfy their urgent Demands; and when he could not pay, they cast him into Prison in <placeName id="OA17500326-geo-61">

His Behaviour was extremely devout and penitent at Prayers, which he was very conversant in, in private as well as publick, and to all Appearance was as well prepared to meet his Fate, as any one in his Circumstances could be thought to be.</p>

He was very close-tongu'd, and silent to all Queries put to him, and would only say he did not choose to have his Name blasted in Papers after he was dead; he was to suffer for what he had done, and thought that Punishment sufficient to make all the Amends that could be made with Regard to the Things of this World. He has been concerned in many Robberies, and a noted Pickpocket, but nothing would he own, unless the Robbery for which he suffered; and even in that he said he had the least Share, tho' he suffered so much for it; for sometimes he would scarce own he was any ways concerned, and reflected upon others, saying, they had sworn away his Life. Being told that they had done no more than himself would have done, had he had the Opportunity of it, he said he would not; he would have suffered for it himself had he been first taken, and would never have betrayed his Companions. It was said to him, he would not appear the better Man in the Eye of the World, or in the Sight of God, for such a Resolution persisted in, for that it was a received Maxim in the World, that it is better to discover Combinations and Conspiracies in real Wickedness, than to cover them; to which Reasons of Interest, as well as Policy, conspired to persuade. He could scarce bear the Sight of some of his Accomplices, who escaped in Consideration of Discoveries made by them; but at length being perswaded, that had it not been for his own Folly and Wickedness, they had not had an Opportunity of making what Discovery was made against him. After a little Reflection, he said that it was true, and for the future he would take all the Blame upon himself, and not entertain any Thoughts of Envy or Malice against those who had been the Means of his being brought to Justice.</p>

            <p>Busby, Russel and Oldfield, were generally pretty constant Companions, hardly ever robbing asunder, tho' they were obliged to separate and fly for it about 5 or 6 Weeks ago, by the Courage of a Man they attack'd in the <placeName id="OA17500326-geo-69">

Busby knew not how to behave, for by this Time, the Women by their Noise had alarmed all the People at the <placeName id="OA17500326-geo-71">

Russel and Oldfield got over the Rails, and made their Escape, but Busby not having Time to get away so soon as his Companions, was forced to lie down flat upon his Belly while the Pursuers past him, and then made off, narrowly escaping being taken.</p>

            <p>This seemed very much to intimate his thorough Knowledge of the whole Affair, though he never would say that he did the Whole. It was certainly a very vile and iniquitous Affair, and there is too much Reason to believe that it was not done without his Consent, and therefore his Punishment was highly deserved; for had not the poor Father been to be found, he might have had his wicked Purpose serv'd, to the great Injury and Prejudice of his grey Hairs. And besides,</p>
            <p>His ill Behaviour while under Sentence of Death, was a strong Presumption he was not that innocent Man he would have appeared to be; for he pretended Sickness, in order to have an Opportunity, while others were at Chapel, to saw off his Irons, which he did, and to use other Means towards making an Escape; which he owned to be the Invention of his own wicked Imaginations, and had persuaded one more to be concerned with him. It was very lucky they were detected in this their Villainy before others came into it, which, no Doubt, they would have done, if Opportunity had been permitted. But they were nipped in the Bud, and all Hopes of any Thing of that Kind cut off; though indeed it was at best but a forlorn Hope; yet, as no one knows what a great Fire so small Sparks might have kindled, and what Mischief might have rose from it, the Discovery may be said to be very fortuitous and providential.</p>
            <p>If he was not the wicked Contriver of the whole Forgery, he was the main Instrument by which the Cheat was to be brought about, and without his Privity and Consent to the Whole, it is scarce credible how he could have entered into any Share of it. He was much uneasy and troubled in his Mind to the last, and declared himself heartily sorry for what he had done; but for what worldly Reasons I know not, he seems not to have declar'd the whole Truth of the Affair; which he was the more pressed to do, that such bad Practices might in some Measure be exposed, and Impositions of this Nature be guarded against for the future; which every Discovery of this Nature may tend to do,</p>

            , in the fourth, went from Newgate to the Place of Execution, and suffered the Sentence of the Law.</p>
            <p>None of them said any Thing particular at the Place, except Sundiland, who declared to the Populace, that he died innocent of the Fact for which he suffer'd. They all behaved well, serious, and composed, except Busby, who laugh'd very heartily more than once, in speaking to some Acquaintance to take care of his Body, which Behaviour surprized every Beholder. When I went into the Cart, from which they were executed, I spoke to him particularly, and said, he had forgot himself and his Condition at this latter End. He replied, No, Sir, I had no evil Thoughts; and appeared very composed and attentive afterwards, as did all the rest.</p>
            <p>When the Bodies were cut down, the four Smugglers were put into a Hearse, to be conveyed to their several Places appointed; and the rest were taken care of by their Friends. The whole was conducted with the utmost Decency, and without any Disturbance or Tumult.</p>
