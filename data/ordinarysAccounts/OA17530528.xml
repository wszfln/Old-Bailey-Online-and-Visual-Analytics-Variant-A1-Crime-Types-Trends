Tho' he could never read a Word in a Book, he has been so much Abroad as to be able to speak French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, &amp;c. He was a poor ragged Wretch, having scarce a whole Piece in his Coat, Waistcoat, or Breeches; and after Conviction the Man appeared disordered in his Senses; insomuch, that tho' he would sometimes seem attentive when at Prayers, and would say he loved to hear the Word of God, yet there was scarce any such Thing as making him sensible of his miserable State, any farther than as he felt the Pressures of Hunger and Nakedness. This poor unhappy Wretch was very deservedly convicted of the Fact the Indictment was laid against him for; and another might have been proved by the same Evidence. But as he was found guilty of the first, the second was not try'd. He had just Sense enough to own both the Robberies, and said he robbed for Want. He died in a most miserable Condition, and could scarce be said to be in his Senses for some Days before he died. The Coroner sat upon his Body, and granted a Warrant for his Burial.</p>
            <p>This was the famous Robber, who, it is generally believed, gave Rise to a certain pompous Advertisement, concerning an imaginary Robbery in the Neighbourhood of Enfield; which, as it is recent in most Peoples Minds, we have no Occasion to particularize.</p>

            <p>It was found that he had been Journeyman to several Master-Taylors in &amp; about the City, and had got good Wages; yet this did not account for his Dress and Appearance. After some Time it was rumoured that Jones worked with a Master-Taylor who was not a Freeman, and that Jones also was a Foreigner. This, agreeable to the Usage of all Companies, occasioned a Summons, to shew Cause why he did not make himself free of the City of Bristol, as he reaped the Advantages of that Body. Jones's Master was averse to it; which Jones being acquainted with, in order to support his Master's Quarrel, he contrived this most iniquitous Scheme; viz. he swore large Debts, of 500 l. each, against the two Persons who caused the Summons to be served upon his Master, and had them arrested; in consequence of which, their other Creditors came upon them, and they were cast into Prison, where one</p>

Now he is dead and gone, his cheating Tricks are to be heard of from every Quarter. For many Years after he left his own Country, go where he would, his Appearance was always very gay. This, he says, was about twelve Years ago, and he has been remarkable almost all that Time for a Cheat and Impostor.</p>
            <p>About six Years ago he resided at <placeName id="OA17530528-geo-16">

He had a Quarrel with a Gentleman in that Neighbourhood, whom he endeavoured to ruin by all the wicked and detestable Arts of Perjury, &amp;c. tho' at length the Gentleman got the better of his Attempts by a fair Trial at Law, and with great Difficulty at last washed his Hands of Jones, greatly rejoiced to have got rid of such a Pest of Society.</p>
            <p>Soon after Jones came to London he married a Woman with whom he might have lived very happily, but she was not of that Stamp which was fit for his Purpose, and he soon forsook her, leaving her to shift for herself, after he had destroyed and squandered away all that she had brought him. Since that Time he has had 15 or 20 Wives, just as he could pick them up, who were fit to favour him in his Designs, whom he kept, or turned off, just as it appeared to him most convenient. But, as a profligate and abandoned Way of Life seldom lasts long; for either a Man sees his Error, and returns from the Evil of his Ways, or else he is so hurried on that Ruin comes on apace; so happened it with Jones: It pleased God, that in the Beginning of the Year 1752 he was overtaken by the Hand of Justice, and he was punished as the Nature of his Crime would admit, according to the Laws of this Kingdom. In the Month of March, in the Year aforesaid, he was taken up, and charged with several Offences, which proved Misdemeanors, to which our Laws affix certain Punishments.</p>
            <p>The first Time he was brought before the Court he was ordered to find Bail before the Lord Mayor, or lay in <placeName id="OA17530528-geo-17">

            <p>At the May Sessions, in the Year aforesaid, he was tried upon two Indictments for Misdemeanors. The first was, he came to a Mercer's Shop, and there took upon himself to be Servant to

            , a Taylor, who was then a Customer to the Mercer, pretending he was sent by his Master for nine Yards and an Half of Cloth-coloured single Allapeen, and six Yards of White Allapeen, whereby the Servant of the Mercer delivered to him the aforesaid Goods, Value 29 s. and upwards, the Goods and Chattels of his Master the Mercer, August 30, 1751.</p>
            <p>On that Day Jones came to the Shop, and very artfully, as if he feared to be mistaken, he looked up at the Sign, and said, loud enough for the People there to hear, he believed he was right. He asked if his pretended Master did not deal at that Shop, and was answered in the Affirmative: Upon which he pulled out a Pattern of Cloth, and asked for a single Allapeen to match it. The Servant shewed him some Patterns the nearest they had, and Jones, (resolved to have a Booty,) said, that he had tried at the other End of the Town, and could not match it; so he resolved to take one that was produced, observing that Allapeens were not to be expected to match as well as Shalloons.</p>
            <p>He carried the Affair on so artfully, that the Servant did not suspect a Cheat; and tho' he asked Jones what was become of the Foreman that used to come to their Shop, from his present pretended Master, he answered so warily, that the Man was persuaded he came from the same Person that dealt at their Shop. He asked him his Name, and Jones took upon him the Name of

            <p>When he had thus far made himself known he thought he was safe, and so might take up more Goods without Danger. Then he asked for a Piece of white Allapeen; which being shewn, he very artfully said, that his Master talked to him first ofa whole Piece, but at last bid him bring only six Yards; so the Man delivered Jones the Goods for the Use of his Master, who was ready with a Wrapper under his Arm to receive them. The Servant of the Shop seem'd satisfied of the Validity of the Order, and immediately entered the Goods down in his Book, as bought of his Master, for the Use of Jones's Master.</p>
            <p>The next Day came the real Foreman, and his Appearance surpriz'd the Shopman. He told him about the Allapeen the Day before, fetch'd for the Use of his Master; but he being sensible none was brought that Day, if there had he must have known it, the Fraud appeared; and Jones being taken up, the Shopman swore positively to him, and he was found guilty. The real Foreman being upon the Trial, was asked by Jones what was his Character; and gave for Answer, that his general Character among the Trade was that of a Cheat.</p>
            <p>He was a second Time indicted at the same Sessions, for that he came to a Shop in <placeName id="OA17530528-geo-22">

He came to the Shop, and asked for the Cloth; and being asked by the Servant in the Shop if he lived with the Gentleman's Taylor, he answered No, but he was to make those Cloaths himself. He then called himself Price, and said he lived in Red-Lion Square; and the Servant delivered him the three Yards of Cloth, after asking him whether he should send it Home, and Jones saying No, took it away himself.</p>
            <p>Some Time after the Gentleman came to the Shop, and being told of the three Yards of Cloth deliver'd to such a Person, he declared he never sent for it. Upon which, Enquiry was made, and Jones being in the Gatehouse, and having been a long Time suspected of these Cheats, the Servant was sent to see him. When he came there he saw Jones, and knew him again, and positively swore that he was the Man, who, under this Pretence, cheated him of the three Yards of Cloth: And he was again found guilty.</p>
            <p>He was a third Time indicted at the same Sessions, for a Crime of the same Nature, coming to a Woollen-Draper's, and pretending to be a Taylor's Foreman, got more Cloth, Nov. 8, 1750; but no Prosecutor appearing, he was acquitted of that Charge; not that he was innocent, but as he was already convicted of two such Frauds, it was only taking up the the Time of the Court in vain, and to no Purpose; because if he had been proved guilty of twenty such Cheats, his Punishment would</p>

            <p>have been no other than it was, the Law punishing such Offences in a certain Manner. There were several other Charges, if not Indictments against him at that Time, and all of the same Nature.</p>
            <p>Upon Jones being found guilty of the two Indictments as above, the Court ordered him to be whipp'd, and stand on the Pillory, at the upper End of <placeName id="OA17530528-geo-23">

            <p>All this had no Manner of Effect on his Mind, he rather grew worse than better under Chastisement, and, as he would not be reformed, it pleased God to let him fill up the great Measure of his Iniquities, and run upon his own Destruction: For even while he was confined in Newgate, he learned the Means of doing the Thing for which he suffered Death.</p>
            <p>It is not more than six Months since he escaped with his Liberty, after he had undergone the Punishment of his former Transgressions. All this while, how could he live? He had no Fortune, no Business; for who would employ him? And he must have been very diligent to support himself, &amp;c. even for six Months; and, it is plain that he has done it by his old Tricks, and frequent Repetitions of them.</p>
            <p>On the 9th of March last, he was again committed to his old Lodgings, the Gatehouse, for cheating, and defrauding, by a certain false Token; and, for Want of Sureties, he was detained on the Oath of several Persons, for defrauding a Woollen Draper of four Yards of superfine Cloth, five Yards of white Shalloon, and three Yards and a Quarter of Drab Cloth, under false Tokens and Pretences, March 15, 1753.</p>
            <p>He was also detained on the Oath of others, for publishing as true, a false Order, in another Person's Name, purporting to be an Order for the Delivery of some Cloth, with an Intent to defraud, March 23.</p>
            <p>His old Trick of personating a Taylor's Foreman would do no longer; he made too much Use of that, and had now discovered a new Method of carrying on his Designs. This last Method he has not practis'd so long as he had the former. He was timely detected, or he might have carried on his Cheats by this Method, as he had done by others, almost innumerable.</p>

Accordingly, he very artfully writes a Letter, or Order for Cloth, and particularly desires, it may be somewhat better than the last blue Cloth he had, meaning, the Person in whose Name the Letter was wrote.</p>
            <p>And so artfully had he contrived the Diction of the Letter, though the Forgery was too plain, that the Draper's Servant says, had not that Particular been Part of the Order, viz. desiring to have better blue Cloth than the last, he should not have delivered the Goods. That Instance made him believe the Order came from his Customer, and though he knew it was not his Hand-writing, yet did he not suspect it to be the Forgery of a Cheat. However, upon fair Trial, the Indictment was proved to the Satisfaction of the Jury, and they brought him in guilty; nor had he any Thing to say in his own Defence, but audaciously to deny the whole Matter laid to his Charge, and to call in Question the Character of the Evidence, by whom he sent the Letters for the Cloth.</p>
            <p>And the Grounds upon which he took upon him to impeach the Character of the Evidence, were founded on a wicked Scheme of his own. Jones had by some Means procured an Indictment to be preferred against him at <placeName id="OA17530528-geo-28">

Even Jones's own Evidence upon his Trial, whom he called in his own Behalf, being ask'd what they knew of the Witness's Character; to his great Disappointment declared they knew no Ill of him. Jones, tho' convicted, and knowing his Character would admit of no Hopes of Mercy, in an impious and blasphemous Manner declared, he would not be hang'd. What he meant by it, appeared chiefly from his future Behaviour. In the first Place, he took it into his Head, that he would be a <rs id="OA17530528-occupation-10" type="occupation">Roman Catholick</rs>

            <p>And, what was the Consequence? why while he should have employed his Time in searching his Heart, and repenting of the Multitude of his Sins, his Thoughts were chiefly taken up in meditating an Escape. He kept his Cell, and seldom came out of it; but on Saturday last an Attempt was to have been made, not without Bloodshed, had their Design taken Place. His Irons wereboth saw'd thro'. Upon Enquiry, he said they were the same as when put on, but upon Search the contrary appeared. Being double-ironed again, he remain'd safe till Monday Morning; and when they were then knocked off, he was willing to persuade those about him that he was a very innocent Person, and that his Life was wrongfully sworn away.

He denied that he was ever at the House, or saw the Tankard; and no stronger Evidence appearing, he had the good Luck a second Time to be acquitted.</p>

            <p>As he was bred to the Sea, he followed it several Years, during the Time of the late War; and when he was discharged the Service, he spent the little he had as fast as he could, in Riot and Debauchery; and when all was gone, having contracted bad Habits with bad Company, he became a dissolute Fellow, and turned Robber.

            <p>Tho' he pretended to be so much tired of Life, yet he was either wicked or weak enough to think of saving it by coming into the same idle Scheme of making an Escape; and he also had his Irons sawed off both Saturday and Sunday before Execution.
