            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173903140003"/>
            <p>of capital Crimes, and receiv'd Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>When under Sentence they were instructed in the Necessity of Regeneration, from these Words of our Saviour, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a Man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God, Joh. 33. They were inform'd, that it was absolutely necessary to become new Creatures, to forsake their former evil Ways, more especially those heinous Crimes which were the Cause of those grievous Afflictions which now they were under, and in order to attain this happy Change, they were to consider, that tho' they were admitted into the Christian Church by Baptism, and had been Partakers of this outward Symbol of the Covenant, yet having in a signal manner broken the Conditions of that solemn Engagement, so now it was incumbent upon them to renew these sacred Vows, and to seek after the spiritual Blessings procured by the Blood of Christ, and the influences and the Illumination of the Holy Spirit, by whom we are renewed in our Minds to Holiness in the Fear of God.</p>
            <p>Two of them happening to die for the Sin of Uncleanness, they were inform'd, that Chastity or Purity was a principal Duty, with Regard to our own Bodies, for the Apostle says, He that committeth Fornication sinneth against his own Body, 1 Cor. vi. 18. and that this Virtue consisted in a perfect abstaining from all kind of Impurity, in Thought, Word, and Action. From these and such like Considerations, they were desired to consider how far they had deviated from the Rule of right Reason, Scripture and Religion, and to be importunate with God to create clean Hearts, and renew right Spirits within them, in imitation of penitent and holy David.</p>
            <p>The rest of them suffering for Covetousness, Theft, and Robbery, they were advised to reflect upon the many Irregularities they had committed, how contrary these Practices were to the holy Christian Life, enjoin'd us by Christ and his Apostles, how destructive to all human Society in general, and how pernicious to themselves, in making them liable to the highest Penalties of human Laws, even Death itself. In Consideration of their being appointed to die, I exhorted them to prepare for Death and Judgment, to exercise a lively Faith upon Christ the Son of God, and only Saviour of Sinners, to repent sincerely of all their Sins, and to pray that the Love of God might be shed abroad in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>They were also instructed in the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, wherein our Baptismal Vows are renewed, our Faith strengthned, our Hope confirm'd, and our Love to God and Men encreas'd.</p>
            <p>After Sentence they all attended in Chapel, and those of them who could read join'd in our Prayers; all of them were very attentive, and behaved indifferently well; but were not so much concern'd as People in their dismal Circumstance, ought to have been. Adamson was sick about three Weeks, when I visited him in the Cell, he expressed a deep Sense of his Guilt, and afterwards he came constantly to Chapel with the rest. <persName id="OA17390314n18-1">

Next Morning she went out by seven o'Clock, and never saw the Father again, but upon his Trial; but went about from Place to Place for two or three Weeks, till at last she grew so bad, that she could scarce move; then she discover'd her Case to an Aunt and an Uncle; they had her examined by a Surgeon, who declared her tainted with the soul Disease. The Uncle thought the Crime so horrid, that he resolved to prosecute him, and procuring a Warrant from a Justice, after the Surgeon had made his Declaration, he sought three Weeks after him; but he had absconded; at last they found him and took him up. Though the Proof was clear, yet he was not willing to acknowledge his guilt, but pretended not to be conscious of his having committed the Fact, and that in his Sleep, he might in turning about, give her some Offence. I intreated him not to dye with a Lye in his right Hand, but to glorify God by a free Confession; upon which Subject I preached twice. After all could be said, he would not acknowledge his Crime; but blam'd his Brother-in-Law as having a Spite against him. He was too obstinate in his Temper, and all that was said to him did not affect him. Upon Wednesday the 24th of January, he abus'd his Brother who attended him daily, with scurrilous Language, because he would not encourage him as to a Reprieve, about which he was too anxious.

He alledg'd at first, that he only once attempted the Crime; but afterwards, he own'd the Charge as given in Evidence against him, only he did not acknowledge some Circumstances, which its not proper to mention; and he complain'd a little of his Master, for cudgelling him into a Confession of the whole, and in the mean Time promising to deal favourably with him, upon a full Discovery.

I have sold several Pieces of Work that have been worth five or six Guineas, and have taken three Guineas in Part of Payment, agreeing if the Watch prov'd ill, or went not well, to alter it, or return the Money in such a limited Time, and all the Watches I then disposed of, I took Care should be complain'd of, by which Means I got them again under Pretence of making them keep Time, and immediately have disposed of them again to Persons whom I have likewise served in the Manner I did the first Buyer: For this I ask Pardon both of God and the Persons I have thus injured.</p>

Baker observing a Man behind with a Blunderbuss, swore if he did not immediately fling it away he would shoot him dead upon the Spot. Wager at the same Time stood by the Coachman and I by the Postilion. When the Man had thrown his Blunderbuss from him, Baker rode up to the Coach Door and robbed the Passengers; when he had done, as we were all riding off, the Man drew a Horse Pistol from under his Coat, and firing at us I was wounded, and fell down stunn'd upon the Pummel of my Saddle; when I came to myself, I found one of my Companions, imagining I was killed, turned back and shot the Man through the Body.</p>
            <p>By this Accident I was rendered for some time uncapable of going out with them, for I was very much wounded, and was carried to one Combes's, a Farmer about five Miles from <placeName id="OA17390314-geo-93">

            <p>There was a Murder committed indeed much in the same manner at Turnham-Green, upon a Man who came as Guard to a Stage Coach, which set out from the Bell-Savage-Inn on Ludgate-Hill: This Murder was committed by some of our Company; but I solemnly declare I was not concerned is that Fact, nor present with them when it was committed.</p>

O Lord turn your hearden'd Heart, to come to me! as for the false Reports of the World to you, they are raised to prevent your coming: But Lord God who knowest every Word and Action, send that the Gates of Heaven may shut up against me, and never shew me Mercy, if I have been guilty of what you have been told, since I was with you last in Woodstreet-Compter; consider within yourself, whether you have done as you ought to have done; if I was the biggest Rogue in the World, and the greatest Stranger, you could not have slighted one more; I look upon you, as my own Flesh and Blood, and if you be so slighting, whom I never offended, how do you think I can think God will shew me Mercy; If you don't, O Lord turn the Heart of this Woman, turn the Heart of her O Lord, it is all my Cry O Lord, to bring her nigh to me, that I may reveal my Mind to her, or else if you don't come, I shan't die in Peace; in your coming, I shall forgive all the World, as I hope for Forgiveness thro' the Merits of Jesus Christ; I shall say no more at present, but your coming will make me easy in my Mind.</p>

My Father was a Taylor, and dy'd when I was but two Years of Age. When I was three Years old, I was taken from my Mother by an Aunt, who kept a Tavern in the same Town; by her I was brought up, and she would have given me a good Education, if I would have received it; but she never could get me to learn so much as to read one Chapter in the Bible. As therefore she had little hopes of me, she would have bound me Apprentice to a Captain of a Ship, but I refused at that Time to go to Sea. Afterwards my Mind altered, and I was desirous to go, but then she would not agree I should. Upon this I determin'd to come up to <placeName id="OA17390314-geo-141">

I acknowledge to have deserv'd Death, and that being brought acquainted with lewd Women by my Fellow-prentice, I got the foul Disease; and now it is my unhappy Fate to dye, I freely forgive my Master and Mistress, and all the World; and I hope my Fellow-prentice and all other young Men will take Warning by my unhappy Death, and shun the Crimes which have brought me to this shameful End.</p>

            <p>Good People,</p>
            <p>I AM now brought to this Place to suffer a shameful and ignominious Death, and of all such unhappy Persons, 'tis expected by the World they should either say something at their Death, or leave some Account behind them; and having that which more nearly concerns me, viz. the Care of my immortal Soul, I chose rather to leave these Lines behind me, than to waste my few precious Moments in talking to the Multitude. First, I declare I die a Member, tho' a very unworthy one of the Church of England as by Law establish'd, the Principles of which, my Parents took an early Care to instruct me in.</p>
            <p>My Life being justly forfeited for my Offences, it becomes me to do all that is in the Power of such an unhappy Wretch as I am, to render my Punishment serviceable to my Country, by exhortting those who have already set their Feet in these Paths, to turn back in Time, before the Judgment of the Law hath overtaken them, and to inform such young Creatures as may be misled into a Belief, that there is something pleasant and engaging in a Life of Plunder, because those who once engage in such Ways, are seldom, if ever reclaim'd.</p>
            <p>Such licentious Delights as Men who abandon themselves to robbing and stealing continually wallow in, are of all Things the farthest from giving any Satisfaction; judge then what Miseries are felt by those who are wretch'd, awake and restless in their Sleep who are constantly in Terror, and affrighted at the shaking of a Leaf. O! how miserable a Road is that which leadeth to Destruction; what Agonies do the Wicked feel in their Journey thro' the Paths of Death. May all shun them who read this Paper.</p>
            <p>Those whom in the Course of a very wicked Life I have wrong'd, will I hope accept of that Punishment the Law hath justly adjug'd me to, and which I shall have suffer'd before this comes to their Hands, and not load my Memory with Reproach, or transfer them to any who survive me, and who ought not to suffer in their Character for my Crimes, as well as in their Fortune from my Extravagance and Folly. Their Charity in forgiving me will redound to themselves, and as to all who have injur'd me in my Life-time, I sincerely and unfeignedly o give them. The Mercy of God thro' Christ light on my departing Soul, and cleanse it from all Spos of Sin before I appear in the Presence of my Creator. Amen.</p>

This I thought might be of Service to the Publick in general, to make more fully known to such whose Misfortune is to be afflicted as I was, and where they may find a speedy and safe Cure, and I am ready and willing to justify the Truth of wh is here inserted.</p>
            <p>And whereas many afflicted with  Distempers, and live at a Distance whereby arrived of the successful Use of this nervous cine, it is so ordered, as to be sent to any Distance,  seven Shillings the Bottle, with Directions, which Operates all upon the Blood, Spirits and Nerves, the principle Seat or these Disorders, which at first taking, the Patient is presently relieved, by strengthning the weak and feeble Nerves, enriches the Blood, and is a Cordial to the Stomach; so as the Patient sends their dition, and how long they have been afflicted, in a ter to the Doctor, Post paid.</p>
            <p>Note, The Doctor cures the Pa, caused  Cold or Moisture, which chills and over moistens the Head and Nerves, or with a too heavy nervous Juice; and many Times when the Speech hath been taken away for some Months: and likewise the Use of one Side, Arm or Leg, and the Decay of Age, when the Solids grow Crisp and dry, and subject the Limbs and other Parts of the Body to Tremblings and Weakness for the Method I take, wonderfully ickens the Sense and Motion of the Fibres in Constitutions, overflowed with Cold, , and Defluction.</p>
