            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173012230004"/>
            <p>to Prison, in order to be reserv'd for Transportation.</p>
            <p>Many of them having been extravagantly wicked, obstinate and impudent young Fellows, I was oblig'd often to threaten them with Hell and Damnation, and to tell them, that they deserv'd no Favour of God nor Man, and that all the Miseries and Misfortunes they met with, were a Punishment too little for their Villainies; but they were foolish and inconsiderate, that it was very hard to gain upon them, or to do them any Good, so as to bring them to a Sense of Sin, and to consider upon the Evil of their Ways.</p>
            <p>I expos'd Sin to them in its Nature and Consequences; how that it was a direct Breach of the Law of God, which is altogether Holy, Righteous and Good, that it was contrary to the divine Nature, which is perfect and happy in itself, whereas Sin implies nothing but Deformity, Absurdity, Inconsistency, and a Privation of Happiness, that it was Vile and Detestable in its Author the Devil, who was the first Sinner, and consequently the Father of Sin, and therefore it is, that our Blessed Saviour reproving the obstinate and wicked Jews, for their maliciously persecuting him, and for their Infidelity in not believing him to be the true Messias, says, Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Lusts of your Father ye will do: He was a Murtherer from the Beginning, and abode not in the Truth, because there is no Truth in him, when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own; for he is a Liar, and the Father of it. St. Jo. 8. 44. And St. John again says, For all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, and the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World, 1 Jo. 2. 16.</p>
            <p>And as Sin is thus evil, ugly, monstrous and deformed in its Nature, yet it is still more Pernicious in its fatal Consequences, and this the Apostle declares, For the Wages of Sin is Death: but the Gift of God is eternal Life through Jesus Christ our Lord, Rom. 6. 23. The Wages of Sin is Death Temporal, as occasioning the Separation of the Soul from the Body; Spiritual, in making us become Dead in Trespasses and Sins; and Eternal, in being seperated for ever from the Presence of the Lord, and the Glory of his Power, and in their being expos'd to the eternal Wrath, and Indignation, and Vengeance of the great God in Hell Fire. Sin was that which excluded our first Parents Adam and Eve from Paradise, a Place of Pleasure, and render'd</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173012230005"/>
            <p>them and all their Posterity miserable. Sin is the Overthrow of Empires, the Destruction of flourishing Common-Wealths, the Ruin of private Families, and the Plague of particular Persons. And therefore the wise Solomon saith, Righteousness exalteth a Nation: but Sin is a Reproach to any People, Pro. 14. 34.</p>
            <p>From those and such like Considerations, I let them see what they might in Justice expect, who had been so very atrocious Sinners. Upon the Wicked he shall rain Snares, Fire and Brimstone, and an horrible Tempest: this shall be the Portion of their Cup.</p>
            <p>And as I thus shew'd them their Misery by Sin, so I declar'd to them the Remedy by Grace, which was to be obtain'd by a saving Faith in Christ, the only Saviour of Sinners. Neither is there Salvation in any other: For there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be saved. Acts 4. 12. And then I advis'd them to repent sincerely of all their Sins, for except we repent, we shall all likewise perish. St. Luke 13. 3. To forgive all Injuries done them, as they expected Forgiveness from God; and to make Resolutions of new Obedience, with holy David to say, I have sworn, and will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments. Psal. 119. 106.</p>
            <p>And since, they were to die, I exhorted them to partake of Christs Death in the blessed Sacrament, as he commanded us, to do this in remembrance of him, in Commemoration of his Death and Sufferings, which are the Meritorious Cause of our Shunning eternal Death, and obtaining everlasting Life.</p>
            <p>While those and other Exortations were given; they attended in Chapel, and made regular Responces, but not with that Seriousness which became Men in their desperate Circumstances. Hall, White, and some others laugh'd too often in time of Divine Service, for which they were sharply reproved, as being incorregible, insensible Sinners.

            <p>His Companions are all since fled. On Monday Morning, the 14th of December, in Time of Divine Service he laugh'd and provok'd some of his Associates to do so. He was an abandon'd, wicked, light-headed Wretch, and good for nothing. I reprov'd him sharply, and told them they deserved no Favour of God nor Man for such irreverent Carriage, they afterwards behav'd better. He profest his Faith in Christ, Repentance for his Sins, and freely forgave all Injuries done him.</p>

            <p>He affirmed, that he never thiev'd nor robb'd, but lived always honestly, and pay'd every Body their own. I exhorted him to an ingenuous Confession, as a Duty incumbent on him, towards God in the First Place; so in the Second Place; that he was bound to confess his Sins to Man, whom he had injur'd by robbing them of their Goods, and attacking them in a violent Manner: And I desired him to consider, that it was not Man, but God he had to deal with, and that God being the God of Truth, and the Searcher of Hearts, he could not be mocked, by entering upon Eternity, and appearing before his Maker, with a Lie in his Right Hand; and what a terrible Thing is it to fall into the Hands of a Sin revenging God? Notwithstanding the Woman who was Robb'd, pursu'd him straight to his House, knew him when ever she saw him, swore to his Face, discover'd him among more than 30 other Men, and before she saw him, she describ'd him so justly, that the Constable knew him to be the Man, and this with much more confirm'd by Circumstantial Evidence, which amounted to a pretty clear Proof: After all I could say, he still continued in a peremptory Denial of the Fact, and said he never wrong'd Man, Woman nor Child of a Farthing in his Life. And this, the Sunday before he died, and at other Times, he affirm'd with Asseverations and Imprecations, before great Numbers of People in Chapel. He appear'd somewhat Penitent, Wept, and was like to faint away in Chappel, after the Dead Warrant came out, and he saw there was no expectation of a Reprieve; but neither he, nor the rest seem'd to be in that serious frame of Devotion, which was requisite for Men in their deplorable Conditions. He behav'd Gravely and Civilly in Chapel, and made regular Responses, but he spoke too often and too much to his Wife, and some other Friends, who came to Visit him. He cried out mightily against some Gentlemen and Others, whom he blam'd for his sad Fate. Some Body put him in expectation of a Reprieve, the Monday before Execution, upon the same Terms (as it was reported) <persName id="OA17301223n57-1">

            <p>As also the SIXTH EDITION of the SUPPLEMENT to it, both of them Revised, and Enlarged, and now Printed together in One Volume.</p>
            <p>And as the several Passages in the former Impressions, that have been charged with being obscure, and ambiguous, are in these cleared up, and explained, there will be no more Alterations, or Additions made to them.</p>
            <p>These Editions contain some further and surprizing Instances of the Mischiefs by that filthy, sinful Commerce with ones self, which is so notoriously, practised, as well by the Adult as Youth, Women as Men, Married as Single, to the weakening their Generative Faculties, and hindering Procreation, as their Letters of Complaints to the Author, herein inserted, shew.</p>
            <p>And, amongst others, a curious Letter from a Lady, with his answer to it, concerning the Use, and Abuse of the Marriage-Bed; together with divers Casuistical and other Letters from both Sexes, of some secret unnatural Effeminancies, necessary to be known both by the married and single of each Sex.</p>
            <p>To which is added,</p>
            <p>A Curious PIECE, translated out of the Latin from L. S. SCKMEIDER, as it is inserted in the Acta Lipsiensia, concerning the Return of the  into the  of Blood; well worth the Perusal of Physicians. Surgeons, Anatomists, and all others of Art and Curiosity.</p>
            <p>As also Dr. QUINCY's Translation of Dr. CARR's remarkable Answer to a Letter sent by a Divine, concerning two Nuns of Rome, reported to have changed their Sex.</p>
            <p>Likewise Dr. DRAKE, and several other Physicians Opinions of Hermaphredites, and Women brought to a Resemblance of them, by the Practice of Self-Pollution, as  Case of a young Lady of 18. whose well wrote Letter to the Author, describing and lamenting her Condition, is (in order to deter others) inserted.</p>
            <p>A very grave and learned Divine and Physician having perused this Discourse, before it went to Press, returned it with his Opinion of it in these Words.</p>
            <p>This little Book ought to be read by all Sorts of People, of both Sexes, of what Age, Degree, Profession, or Condition soever, guilty, or not guilty of the Sin declaimed against in it.</p>
            <p>Is now Sold only by J. ISTED, Bookseller (Mr. CROUCH, Bookseller in Pater noster-Row being dead) at the Golden Ball between St. Dunstan's Church, and Chancery Lane, in Fleet-Street. Price Stitch'd 3 s. Bound 3 s. 6 d,</p>

            <p>N. B. The Publick are desired to take Notice, (to prevent being imposed on) that there is an ill minded Person who counterfeits the said Medicine, and puts the Title of Godfrey's Cordial on the Top of the Bottles, and in his Bills given with the Bottles, he calls it, The GENERAL CORDIAL, and does not put the Person's Name who prepares it; but as this Counterfeit Maker is now found out by his own Confession, he and his Sellers will be prosecuted as the Law directs. ONE of the unfair Sellers of the sham Medicine, without the Maker's Name who prepares it, is at a Silver-Smith's near Lombard-street, another is at a Cheese Monger's facing Devonshire Square in Bishopsgate-street. But to prevent the Buyers from being imposed on, I have put my Christian Name on the Top of each Bottle, as in the Margent, which is prepared.</p>

            <p>Dr. R. NELSON, being well known to have made the Cure of SEMINAL and GENITAL Imbecilities his chief Study and Practice for many Years, does recommend his most Noble Cleansing and Strengthning Elixir, as the only Medicine in the World.</p>
            <p>For Gleets and Weaknesses, the Bane of Virility in the one Sex, and Destroyer of Fertility in the other, whether from ill cur'd Venereal Infection (than which nothing is more common) or from inordinate Coition, or Self-Pollution (that cursed School Wickedness, which spoils all our Youth, by nipping their Manhood in the Bud) or from Falls, Blows, Strains, Wrenches, hard Labours, Miscarriages, or other Causes, which drain and dry up the Seminals, and wither, as it were, the Generative Faculties, causing Impotency in Men, the Fluor Albus, or Barrenness in Women, or but a weakly, sickly Offspring it any); and in the long Run (by impoverishing the Blood and Spirits) Melancholly, Vapours, Decays of Nature and Consumptions, No Medicine can be more pleasant to take, nor any Thing upon Earth more effectual for the Purpose; for let the Imbecility be ever so great, or of ever so long standing, and be either in the Parts, Spermatick Vessels, or Back, with Pain or without, it certainly Cures, by reviving and enriching the Blood and Spirits comforting, nourishing, and replenishing the Reins and Seminals, and strengthening, and restoring the Genital Parts in both Sexes, how much soever weakned, rendered cold, or deadned, and bringing them to their natural Force, Warmth, and Vigour, by thickening and fertilizing the Seed, which before was thin, waterish, or yellowish, and consequently insufficient, either for Procreation or the Act of it: All Disorders of the Urine' as Difficulty in the making or retaining it, or its dribbling away hot or smarting, or foul slimy, thready greasy, or stinking, whether from Gravel, Stone, Strangury or a Venereal Cause, are likewise speedily cured by it, and the Water made to be held as strongly, and yet brought away as freely, easily, full-stream'd, and clear as ever. Price 5 s. a Bottle. Prepared by the above said Author, and sold only (sealed up with Directions how to take it) at Mr. ISTED's, a Bookseller, at the Golden Ball, between St. Dunstan's Church and Chancery-Lane End in Fleet Street, asking only for a 5 s. Bottle of Elixir.</p>
            <p>Note, One Bottle only of this Elixir, lately cured, among others, a Gentleman of Gray's Inn, and his Friend, of the Stone and Gravel, by mouldering into Fragments, the former, and loosening the latter, and bring them away with the Urine, with Ease and Wonder. The said Gentleman came himself, on Purpose, to Mr. ISTED, to acquaint him thereof, and desired that it might be made publick for the Benefit of others under the like Afflictions; and left with him his Name, and where he might be spoke with by any that should desire a more particular Information.</p>
