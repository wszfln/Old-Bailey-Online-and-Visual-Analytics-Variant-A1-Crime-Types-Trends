Aster they had been together, on the minister's coming out, I asked what he thought of the prisonor? he answered, that the prisoner had not received the spirit, nor had a true sense of sin: on which the minister and I had some discourse. I said, that if he was ignorant, as he was educated in their church, he knew who to blame; that since he had fallen under my care, he had been daily instructed, and taught to pray for all things necessary to eternal life, and that he seemed to profit by it, and to behave with penitence and contrition; that it was no time now to cavil and take exceptions, but to assist the poor dying criminal in the spirit of peace, unity and charity.

            <p>Morning of Execution.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Mr. W. minister of the Lutheran church, attended about seven, and ministered to the poor sick convict Haverman, while my duty called me to poor Adams, who this morning professed a lively hope in God, through Jesus Christ, as an anchor of his soul, sure and stedfast. He devoutly joined in the proper service, and with four others, two of which were prisoners (though neither of the last respited) received the holy sacrament. He appeared well composed, supported, and resigned. They were carried out in one cart before nine, and got to the place about ten. In the way they were devout, serious, and intent on their approaching change. Adams seemed wholly freed from the fear of death, and of his own accord broke forth into praises and psalmody; in which exercise he was employed with a seeming pleasure when tied up to the tree. The surrounding crowd were greatly affected, and several of them shed silent tears. Haverman was so weak by long sickness, contracted in the cells, and so overcome with the apprehensions of death, that he was wholly unable to stand, but sat up as well as he could to prayer. Adams answered every question about his repentance, faith and charity to my great satisfaction, and joined with presence of mind and fervency in proper prayers for near half an hour: to which Haverman attended, and then the German minister took his turn to exhort, comfort, and pray earnestly for him in his own language: During which, Adams was well employed in devout ejaculations and earnest cries for mercy,</p>

            <p>till he seemed faint with speaking, and parched with thirst and heat, on which occasion he eagerly desired something to moisten his mouth, saying, I am very thirsty which gave me much concern, that there was no water at hand to relieve him: but he quickly turned it off, and corrected himself, saying, " I shall soon be " refreshed at the fountain of living " water; I shall soon have it," and then praying earnestly, seemed greatly relieved. After the final prayers and blessing, we parted. It required several minutes to lift up Haverman and settle the rope about his neck, while he was supported by two men; during all which time, Mr. W. the Lutheran minister, continued praying for him fervently, and with a loud voice, exhorted him to be faithful and of good courage. After, which they quickly suffered their sentence. And it is much to be hoped, from their humble, penitent and devout behaviour, that it proved to be a deliverance from all their troubles, and a short passage to a better state.</p>

In contradiction to this witness Lacey asserted on his trial, that he had not opened his mouth before he received a blow, meaning a shot out of the coach, which took his right hand to pieces. This is here remarked because Lacey persisted in this assertion to the populace at the place of execution, that he had not fired one pistol. And Edwards has ever since his conviction said the same for himself, that he did not fire; whereas two witnesses, Povey and Bareau, positively swear to the fact, that each of them fired into the coach before they were fired at; and that one of the bro</p>

Notwithstanding Lacey's being thus the means of taking Edwards, they were so far reconciled as to be together in one cell till their execution. An instance of mutual forgiveness, which was observed to their advantage. From the time of their conviction they were daily visited, instructed and prayed with as usual. They behaved themselves humbly and decently, promising and professing to comply with the directions given them, and to make good use of the books lent them in their cells. Lacey being most afflicted with pain and anguish, seemed to be the more serious of the two, and struggled with much difficulty to be helped up four pair of stairs to daily prayers in the chapel, where he was indulged to use what posture he found most easy to him, but kneeled as often as he could bear it. We had also prayers below in the Press-yard as occasion required.</p>
            <p>It is evident Lacey had entertained hopes that his long and sharp sufferings, together with his confession and pleading guilty, would have recommended him so far to mercy as to save his life, and he mentioned something to that purpose when he received sentence of death; but this motive was not successful, considering that his wounds were not gotten in a good cause.</p>

The poor publican was much hurt (if not undone) by this loss of so much of his brewer's money.</p>
            <p>He prevailed on Dr. W - ms, a gentleman in a good station belonging to the first regiment of foot-guards, to recommend him to be a serjeant in the <rs id="OA17640711-occupation-25" type="occupation">Herefordshire militia</rs>

            <p>Since his conviction he has reflected on this punishment and the authors of it, as the inlet to his unnatural death, because his character being lost he was unable to get his bread honestly. But this reflection returns on himself, who by his misbehaviour deserved it.</p>
            <p>Besides the fact for which he suffered, he confessed some others done in company with Edwards (which shall be mentioned in their proper place) but declared he never used any of them ill whom he stopped, but spoke civil, and promised restitution if ever it should be in his power.</p>
            <p>To deter the ignorant and profane transgressors of the laws of God from incestuous pollutions, it may not be improper to mention here that after the death of his wife he is said to have lived with her sister! A fatal omen of his impending ruin. Nor is this the first example of a like punishment falling to the lot of transgressors in this way within the compass of my short experience.</p>
            <p>He, with the rest, was often reminded to repent not only of the crimes which manifestly betrayed them to this death, but the several other transgressions of the divine law, which were frequently set before them.</p>

            <p>&#8220; P. S. As to the coach that Mr. &#8220; Fielding's men were in, we took it to &#8220; be empty, and that the coachman &#8220; should drive us home; and after the &#8220; coachman stopped and we came to the &#8220; coach-door to get into the coach, &#8220; without any words passing, they fired &#8220; at us.

            <p>This p I own raised no small doubt in me that the whole of this representation was partial and defective at least. However upon farther remonstrating to them and questioning each of them apart on these and several other facts of which they were suspected, they persisted in the truth of this confession only, and denied the several other facts repeated to them and each of them severally.</p>
            <p>It can't but be observ'd with what reluctance and delay they were brought even thus far. One day when Lacey was reminded of this duty, he answered, absurdly enough, &#8220; that he had thought of it in private, and made satisfaction to the Lord." To which it was replied, ' The Lord has commanded you to be reconciled, and make satisfaction to your injured neighbour.'</p>
            <p>This being farther explained and enforced as occasion required seemed to have some effect, for after this he joined with Edwards in making the confession beforementioned. He also explained some particulars of the third fact between <placeName id="OA17640711-geo-52">

            <p>On trial it was proved against this convict, that he pursued and persisted in this capital fraud and forgery, in defiance of many repulses, doubts and difficulties (raised by the agents, and naturally occurring to a feigned person) with such uncommon temper and unwearied application as would entitle him to success in a better cause. First he produced a wrong certificate signed by one Holman, (not Howell, as printed by mistake in the trial, for I saw this original forged certificate of one) who was not the master of the Guadaloupe at that time. This being rejected, he was next referred to his captain Price for a more authentic one: but he returned and said, he was not in town. He was then directed to bring a certificate from the clerk at the Pay-office, that he had received his wages there, as he affirmed he had, in the name of Wallis. But this test he also evaded by some false and frivolous excuses, the particular gentleman who sent him not being in the way when he returned to the agent's office. In his frequent resorting, to which having learned that Mr. Hogg was the proper master, he brought a certificate in his name, (which afterwards plainly appeared to be forged also); on this he had an order given him for the money, on one Mr. Duncomb in Wapping, whom he pretended to know, who was to pay him and be repaid by the agent on his signifying that this was the real man. He returned some days after and said, Mr. Duncomb was not in town, renewing his complaints that he came so often about his money. His calm behaviour and patience had now recommended him to a degree of good opinion and confidence, which his repeated evasions might fairly have suspended, and he received 4l. 9s. on account of <persName id="OA17640711n67-2">

The day after Nelson's commitment F. Peters appeared to receive his own prize-money with another seaman, both which had been defrauded of their wages by being personated at the pay-office; and as it is too probably supposed, by this very Nelson, for he had been their mess-mate on board the Guadaloupe; and though he had deserted her at Dominico before the capture of these prizes, yet having got acquainted with the ship's crew, he was qualified to act this atrocious part: to which he was the more encouraged as he knew the boatswain, Wallis, was not in England; he and many others of the Guadaloupe men being turned over to other ships that remained in the country.</p>

He was bred up in the church of Scotland, but now joined with us, and said he delighted in the service of the church of England, which he daily attended in the chapel, and also read proper books in his cell, which were put into his hand on the present unhappy occasion. His behaviour in other respects was decent and proper, except the want of sincerity, as he continued to deny his guilt with a hardness and even an inconsistency scarce to be credited; and though we had frequent calm reasoning on this subject, he seemed to be of the same temper, ever persevering in the wrong, which he had shewn in transacting this dark scene of fraud and forgery; acting the same part over again, now greatly aggravated after such strong proof and conviction, and his alarming condition calling him aloud to repentance: He still resisted all the means employed to bring him to acknowledge the truth. He was plainly and repeatedly warned, that while this leaven of insincerity was in him, all his prayers could avail him nothing, but were rather turned to sin. Yet he still persisted with all the arts of a calm determined deceit to deny his guilt, but in the very denial betrayed himself; for while he denied that he had either received or attempted to receive Wallis's prize-money, he owned that he was to receive some due to himself with a certificate signed by Mr. Holman as master; but when he was told that not Holman but Hogg was master, he withdrew his pursuit for that time, till he found out Mr. Hogg, being master of a sloop in the French trade, lying off Execution-Dock, and went with a certificate signed by him to the agent for his own prize-money, not that of Wallis. Here he was confronted, by telling him, I knew that affair better than he imagined; that I had seen both those certificates, and they were for the</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176407110015"/>
            <p>prize-money of Wallis. And on comparing Mr. Hogg's with another of his real signing his name, it appeared no more his hand than mine. So that on these I fix my finger as false, and by the same rule what you assert of not attempting to receive Wallis's prize-money must be so too. Here he began to draw back and say, he did not see Mr. Hogg write it, but it was given to him for Hogg's writing. He would retract no farther.</p>
            <p>He was now again warned to reflect deeply and seriously on his situation, as a man dying for this crime, that it could avail him nothing even in this world to deny it, as no one could believe him, it being proved by more witnesses than one, who had no reward, no interest in prosecuting him, and who in truth did it with reluctance. He was farther told, that if any mercy were intended to interpose to save his life, it could not be of any effect while he denied a crime so strongly proved. He still said, " He could not confess a thing he never was guilty of."</p>
            <p>On Sunday August the 5th, they were particularly applied to on the subject of some verses out of the first and second lessons, being 2 Sam. xxi. and Acts iii. specially the duty and obligation of rulers to punish offenders for the safety of the people, and the averting of divine judgments from the land, and the use which should be made of such punishments both by those offenders who survive and those who suffer. With an earnest exhortation to both, to employ their best endeavours to make this use of their punishments; considering seriously the great encouragement to true repentance afforded, in the second lesson, to the most guilty and the worst of sinners, in that great example of mercy and salvation offered by the apostle Peter, to the crucifiers of the Lord of life - But ye denied the Holy-one, the just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you, and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses." Acts iii. 14, 15. Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, &amp;c. ver. 19 - 21.</p>
            <p>The next week they were daily instructed in the nature, institution, and manner of preparation for the Lord's Supper; some chosen lessons out of the prophet Jeremiah, the book of Wisdom, ch. i, ii and iii. Luke xv. and Heb. xii. read to them, and then opened and applied. And though Nelson was again and again convinced of self-contradiction in denying his facts, and exhorted most earnestly to truth and sincerity, he still with an obstinate calmness denied the guilt, even in presence of a serious visitor, who joined strongly to represent to him his danger.</p>
            <p>On Monday the 13th, he was asked, whether he would take the holy sacrament on the truth of his innocence? After pausing awhile he said, he would. But he was told, that for several reasons it could not be given him.</p>
            <p>Thus he went on till Tuesday the 14th, about noon, when he had not twenty-four hours to live; and seeing the other two, his fellow-convicts, were to be admitted as communicants and himself excluded, and having been this morning again very earnestly and affectionately applied to, to save his perishing soul by a true confession: he came to me into the closet, after the morning-prayer and before the administration, being conducted by the serious person before-mentioned, and plainly owned he deserved this death for what he had done. Then you acknowledge the justice of your sentence? He answered, I do, saying, " I suffer justly." Being surprized with joy at this long-wished and much-laboured change, no farther questions came into my mind at that moment beside; the time pressed, and with a general exhortation to him and the other two, to recollect and confess whatever they could remember for perfecting their peace, they were all three received to the holy communion.</p>
            <p>Morning of Execution.</p>
            <p>Being visited about seven, they were found ready for chapel in the Press-yard, professed to be easy and resigned, for which they expressed their thanks to God; and when asked, said they had nothing farther to confess: Had spent the evening and morning in prayer and good thoughts, having slept not above two</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176407110016"/>
            <p>hours. They now joined in the litany, some proper prayers and the holy sacrament, and appeared much comforted. An exhortation was given them on the words of the epistle and gospel, Heb. xv. 5. and St. John v. 24. briefly opening to them the chief articles of the Nicene creed, which they had just repeated, so very seasonably, as being connected with the gospel, &#8220; Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life; shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life." They were reminded to keep these most comfortable and heavenly truths in their hearts, together with these two petitions of the Lord's prayer. Thy kingdom come; thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.</p>
            <p>Soon after eight they were brought down, and being loosed from their irons and tied with cords, and they were put into one cart about half an hour after eight, and got to the place of execution a quarter before ten. Lacey was at prayer with his book open and standing up, burst into tears, and hiding his face with his book; the other two were less moved. When tied up to the tree, they were again visited and prayed with half an hour, publicly professing their faith, that they were easy in mind, and in charity with all men. As Lacey had yesterday expressed his desire and expectation of having a proper psalm sung, by means of a friend, with some boys, who were to meet him at this place, and being disappointed of this, instead thereof, the 130th and 143d psalm were repeated, in which they joined, giving glory to God.</p>
            <p>Nelson had been asked this morning, whether he was sensible of the great danger he was in, by standing out so long in a denial of his guilt, &amp;c.? He answered he was sensible of it, and now thanked God for his deliverance, speaking to the same purpose at the place. He was a man of few words, calm and unmoved, whether he spoke truth or falshood. A person who knew him as a lodger in his house in the Borough about a year, said, he never heard him given to swear or speak a rash word; but added, he was close and obstinate. A few minutes before he was turned off he calmly spoke to that person, and returned him a common-prayer book with thanks.</p>
            <p>At a proper interval Lacey spoke to the people to take warning by his shameful end, and to avoid or quit such courses as might bring them to the like; that they might be well assured wickedness will be overtaken, and punished soon or late, here or hereafter. This he repeated earnestly more than once, beseeching them to break off their bad company and evil courses in time, before they were overtaken in their crimes, and then their own guilt would be the worst evidence against them: &#8221; Look &#8220; on us, said he, and if your hearts be not &#8220; hard as steel, you cannot but be touched at &#8220; what you now see, the infamous, the ununtimely death of three poor sinners who &#8220; have justly deserved it: but you see the least &#8220; of our sufferings: consider what we suffer in &#8220; prison and the cells, in pain of body and anguish of soul; and though the latter has &#8220; been much relieved by the the best assistance &#8220; of advice and prayer, and heavenly devotion, to bring them out of misery to happiness, yet at best their sufferings were very &#8220; great, (as might well be imagined) yet &#8220; was he thankful for what he had suffered &#8220; here, hoping it may be the means of escaping far greater sufferings hereafter. He forgave all and prayed for them, especially the &#8220; witnesses who had sworn he first fired at &#8220; them; whereas he said, he had not fired at &#8220; all, having received the shot in his right &#8220; hand, which held the pistol before he fired." This he persisted in to the last. And so earnest was he to warn others, by what he suffered, that he seemed unwilling to leave off. They were dismissed with repeated prayers and blessings. And having all expressed their thanks for these good offices, they patiently suffered their sentence.</p>
