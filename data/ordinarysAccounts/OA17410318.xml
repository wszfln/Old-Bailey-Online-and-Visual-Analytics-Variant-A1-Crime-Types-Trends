He desired to be prayed for as one who was disturbed in Mind, which I accordingly did several Times. He likewise at this Time confessed with a Flood of Tears, both the Robberies which were sworn against him, and that he was the chief Person who robbed Mr. Parish in the House of a large Sum of Money and his Watch, which he put into the fore Pocket of his Coat; and when they had forc'd him to drink Cherry Brandy to such an Excess, as made him drunk, and then they pushed him to the Door, after they had almost murdered him; but they not being satisfied with using him in this manner, Stacey with some more follow'd him up <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-36">

            <p>After the Dead Warrant came down, he behav'd very Penitent, and was continually a Reading, not only to himself, but likewise to the rest of his Fellow-Sufferers, so loud, and so distinctly, that every one of his Fellow Prisoners might hear him very plain, both in publick and private; so that we have Hopes that he was sincere in his Devotion.

Oh! how is it possible such a Wretch can be saved? I answered, believe in the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved; repent of your Sins, and God will be merciful and gracious to forgive you all your Sins, for the Sake of his Son Jesus Christ your dear Saviour, how many and how great and heinous soever they may have been, but be sure at the same Time that you forgive all Persons, as you expect Forgiveness yourself from God.</p>

            <p>He behaved well, constantly came to Chapel, was devout at Prayers, and attentive to Instructions. He intended, he said, to desert, but had not Time, being prevented by his being taken up. He was ignorant and could not read, but willing to receive Instructions. When at Home he liv'd a sober Country Life, and sometimes he received the Sacrament. He was miserably poor and naked, and as he went to Chapel, if he saw any Body, he used to beg Charity of them. He did not seem to be of a bad but penitent Disposition. He assured me that he believed in Christ, as his only Saviour, repented of his Sins, and died in Peace with all the World.</p>

He was a lazy, nasty Fellow, keeping his Bed for 2 Months, tho' not sick, but pleaded for Excuse his want of Cloaths, and that he would not rise till such Time his Brother supplied him with some, and then he vouchsafed to come to Chapel, and behav'd well; he was always hungry, and crying for Victuals, tho' his Brother allowed him a sufficiency every Day, he turned very sick again, and never came up to Chapel. When I visited him in his Cell, and at other Times, he seemed Penitent, and confessed his being a Thief, and committing some small Robberies besides this for which he suffered. He believ'd in Christ, repented of his Sins, and if his Word may be taken on these Heads, died in Peace with all the World.</p>

Being asked what Business he did? he answered that he travelled the Country with a Gun, with a Design to shoot a Brace of Bucks in a Nobleman's or Gentleman's Park when it suited his Purpose, or to rob on the Highway when an Opportunity offered; for it was a general Opinion, that for many Years past he was a constant Practitioner of Highway Robberies, in Company with a Brother of his, who not long ago was tried for his Life, and cast at Chelmsford in Essex, for a Robbery committed there, but John made his Escape when his Brother was taken up. He supported his Family many Years, and went to Church sometimes, took the Sacrament, and had been in good Services, but of late he was very wicked.

            <p>One Cart, not being sufficient to hold them, they were put into two, the Rev. Mr. Broughton praying for them in one, and myself in the other. They seemed very devout, and joined heartily in the Prayers and singing of Psalms; though we were interrupted on both Sides by different Persuasions, on the one Side was a Papist, praying loudly to the Saints, whom I was obliged to rebuke, by telling him he acted contrary to the Laws of our Land, and might be complain'd on, upon which he became silent; on the other Side was a Methodist, who by his Behaviour seemed rather crazy than devout, whom we also silenced, and went on with our Prayers.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17410318n128-1" type="given" value="DANIEL"/>Daniel Jackson</persName>, who was capitally Convicted for the barbarous Murder of his Wife; and who after Condemnation died in his Cell, occasion'd by a Stab which he gave himself the Night he was committed to <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-120">
                  <interp inst="OA17410318-geo-120" type="type" value="site"/>

                        targets="OA17410318n128-1 OA17410318-geo-120"/>Newgate</placeName> for the said Murder.</p>
            <p>NOtwithstanding Daniel Jackson, the unhappy Criminal, who was condemned in October Sessions last, for the barbarous Murther of his Wife, escaped a publick Execution, by putting a Period to his Days before the Time appointed for his Suffering; yet as his Life became a Forfeit to the Law for his heinous Offence, we think it may not be amiss, (and flatter ourselves it will not be unacceptable to our Readers) to give them a succinct Account of what Particulars we have been able to collect, relating to his Birth, his Education, his Course of Life before Marriage, his Behaviour afterwards, and the Crime for which he was to have been made an Example.</p>
            <p>It seems then, that this unfortunate Malefactor, was not only born of honest and credible Parents, but had a tollerable Education; and this is no small Aggravation of his Barbarity, that he was not guilty thereof through Ignorance of his Duty, wherein he was sufficiently instructed; his Father, who belonged to some Branch of the Iron Trade, having taken abundance of Pains to provide for his Family, and having brought up his Children very decently.</p>
            <p>His Son Daniel, when he came to the Age of Thirteen, being a Lad of pregnant Parts, was employ'd  a Gentleman belonging to some Office, to write for him, and this Gentleman had not only Prayers constantly twice a Day in his Family, but the Scripture also expounded to them; so that Daniel had an Advantage which few are so fortunate as to meet with, and it was not for want of knowing better, that he ran upon this Precipice.</p>
            <p>This good Gentleman dying, young Jackson was recommended to another, in whose Service he continued two Years, and was approv'd of, and liked by the whole Family. At the Expiration of these two Years, he remov'd into the Service of a Lady at Westminster, where having a pretty deal of leisure Time upon his Hands, and being then of an industrious Disposition, he learnt to <rs id="OA17410318-occupation-67" type="occupation">make Shoes</rs>

                     targets="OA17410318n128-1 OA17410318-occupation-67"/>, and became a tollerable Proficient in that Trade; insomuch that upon quitting this Lady's Service, he work'd as a Journeyman thereat for some Time.</p>
            <p>Whether he did not then like to follow that Business wholly, or whatever else might be the Reason, we will not pretend to determine, but however that was, one Captain Weaver of St. Mary le Bone, hearing an extraordinary Character of him, was desirous of having him to wait upon him, to which <persName id="OA17410318n133-1">

                  <interp inst="OA17410318n133-1" type="given" value="DANIEL"/>Daniel Jackson</persName> agreeing, he not only was particularly kind to him in other Respects, but indulged him so far, as to let him have a Room in his own House to work in, at his leisure Hours.</p>
            <p>During the Time of his being in this Service, he used to go to the House of the Gentlewoman who was Guardian to his Wife, to acquaint her in what Manner he went on in the World, not forgetting to expatiate on his Industry, to maintain himself in a handsome and genteel Manner: Hereupon the good Gentlewoman highly commended him for his prudent Oeconomy, and accordingly took him for an extraordinary sober, discreet, and thriving young Man.</p>
            <p>After having pretty often repeated his Visits at the aforesaid Gentlewoman's House, he pretended a very great liking to the poor unhappy Maiden, to whom he was afterwards married, and who lived in her Family; the said Gentlewoman being left her Guardian, by her deceased Parents, who were Persons of good Credit, her Father having been a Coachmaker by Trade, and lived and died in Reputation.</p>
            <p>It is not improbable, the Opinion of this young Maiden's being worth Money, may have contributed as much as any Thing else, to this his pretended liking; but however that was, he told the Gentlewoman her Guardian, one Day in Conversation, that he wanted but one Thing to compleat his Happiness, and that was, a sober, and discreet Woman, who would make him a good Wife. Having thus broken the Ice, he afterwards insinuated to the Lady, that he should like one who had been educated under her Care, and at last declar'd his Love expresly to her Ward, Miss. <persName id="OA17410318n136-1">

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103181019"/>
            <p>Unhappily for the poor Creature, and indeed as it has proved for himself, the good Gentlewoman believing him an honest industrious young Fellow, and one who would seemingly prove an affectionate and loving Husband, reply'd, that she had no manner of Objection thereto, and gave her Consent to his courting her for a Wife: She told him, however at the same Time, she believed he might expect a Fortune with her, but that if he did so, he would be greatly deceived; for she had not any Money of hers in her Hands, all that belonged to her being incumber'd with Mortgages, except one House in Cold Bath-Street. His Answer was, that he did not want any Money, but only her Person; upon which, as soon as he had gain'd the poor Creature's good Will, the Gentlewoman gave her Consent very readily, imagining her Ward would be very well disposed of, and that they would live together in a comfortable and happy manner.</p>

            <p>He sound Means however, to make up his Matters in a little while; since he came afterwards and settled in the House belonging to his Wife in Cold Bath street, where he might again have done very well, the House being full of good Lodgers, who paid their Rents duly, and he having tollerable Business, till by his own Neglect he lost it Indeed how should it be otherwise, since he not only frequented Ale-Houses, and would be often drunk, but perfectly turn'd the Night into Day, having been found in Bed with his Wife, at 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, in the midst of Summer, by the Gentlewoman who had been her Guardian.</p>

To which the poor Creature answered, she would willingly rise, but that he oblig'd her to lie as long as himself, and she was forced to comply for the Sake of Quietness, and to avoid being beat: She likewise complained, that he would continually ply her with Anniseed, Gin, Two penny, and other strong Liquors, on purpose as she believed, to destroy her by Drinking; and that tho' she often refused it, he would swear she should take it, and compel her to swallow it.</p>
            <p>As the said Gentlewoman, in order to induce him to be a good Husband, used constantly to give him a Sundays Dinner, he never failed of coming there at that Time; and once amongst the rest, finding a proper Opportunity, broke open a Cabinet, and took out the Release he had given her, as also some other Writings: Not long afterwards he made Application to the said Gentlewoman, to join with him in the Mortgage of the House in <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-124">

Accordingly, upon his framing several specious Pretences, that it would not only set him clear in the World, but would also be very advantagious to him in his Way of Business; with divers repeated Protestations of his Amendment, and making one of the best Husbands for the future; the good Lady in Regard to his Wife, agreed thereto, and it was mortgaged for 50 l all of which he squander'd away riotously in a Months Time.</p>
            <p>It could not reasonably be expected, that any Good should come of so much Extravagance; it is not therefore to be wondered at, that from thenceforth he should make a much worse Husband than ever; frequently bearing and abusing his Wsfe, in a most barbarous and inhuman Manner, so that she was seldom without some Marks about her, occasion'd by his ill Usage; and for some Time before he actually did commit this shocking Murder, she had been apprehensive of his having such an Intention, as she declared more than once, to two or three several People: Once amongst the rest, her Husband having brought Home his Sister <persName id="OA17410318n143-1">

            <p>In Effect, if she ever made the least Complaints of his Extravagances, or remonstrated to him what would be the End thereof, he never failed beating her unmercifully; especially if she ever went to call him Home from the Ale house, though she</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103181020"/>
            <p>did it in never so mild and respectful a Manner. One Time in particular, when he had been sorting for several Days successively, on her going to him, and telling him, My Dear, you are not unsensible I have sat up three Nights together for you, pray come Home, that I may get some Rest; upon which he immediately rose up and went with her, without shewing any Signs of Anger; but no sooner was he got between the Queen's-Head and his own House, than he fell'd her at his Feet; and on her getting up, knock'd her down again, and after that repeated his Blows a third Time, till he had almost killed her.</p>
            <p>But he did not confine his ill Usage to beating her only, for on the 9th of November, he obliged her to dress herself, for no other Cause but to receive a Bastard Child of his, together with the Woman by whom he had it, telling her, that he had a very good Reason for so doing: as it happen'd however, she was spared that Mortification,  the Woman's not coming, because he had not provided her a Coach; but to make her Amends, he went to her on the Monday following, in order  (as is supposed) by supplying her with Money.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of November, his old Mistress, who was his Wife's Guardian, and had been so good a Friend to him, happening to call at his House, sound the poor young Woman in a perfect Agony, like an Aspen Leaf; on enquiring the Reason was told, Mr. Jackson was at the <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-125">

But on the Sunday following, he made earnest Application to the Lady, to let his Wife return Home, making the most solemn Protestations never to beat or abuse her again, but to become a good Husband, and mind his Business for the future: Upon his fair Promises therefore, the Gentlewoman sent for her, and as soon as he set Eyes on her, he embraced her, wept over her (tho' they prov'd but Crocodile Tears) and said, he had never been easy all the Time she was absent, and took her Home with her, seemingly with abundance of Joy: Would any one have expected so soon the dismal Catastrophe that follow'd? Or did ever any one carry Dissimulation farther?</p>
            <p>The very next Day being Monday the 24th, he sent his Servant to his Sister <persName id="OA17410318n148-1">

            <p>On Tuesday the 25th, about Eleven at Night, he bid his Servant take the Key of the Parlour, that he might light the Fire in the Morning; the Boy did so, and went directly to Bed, soon after which a Pistol was heard to go off, which as it appear'd afterwards, his Master had fired at his Mistress, but the Ball went over her Head, and graz'd against the Door of the Room.</p>

            <p>ANswer'd, Her Husband would not let her rise. It is surprizing however, and seems to have been by a sort of Fatality, as she had such sufficient Reason to believe her Life in immediate Danger, she did not desire the Lady to get her Husband secured, and leave him again a second Time. That very Night the old Woman his Mother, came as she had been desired, and staid there till the Saturday, tho' it appears, the Murder was committed on Friday the 28th in the Evening, without their having had any Quarrel or Words whatever, just after they got out of a Coach together, at the upper End of <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-130">

            <p>On his Trial he made little or no Defence, and what he did offer was trifling and absurd; neither did he seem much troubled either in Court, or after Condemnation in <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-131">

            <p>We would willingly give as much Credit to the Words of a ing Man, as Christianity requires, but cannot help saying, by his Behaviour in Newgate, and long premeditated Self-Murder, (as it appears to us) he seems to have been an obdurate and harden'd Malefactor. How shall we otherwise be able to account for the following Circumstances.</p>
            <p>On Sunday the 14th of December, while he was at Chaple, Charles, one of the Men who looks after the condemn'd Criminals, going into his Cell, found some Bloody-Rags, which gave him a strong Suspicion that Jackson had done himself some Mischief, whereupon he acquainted a Gentleman who was a Prisoner in the Press Yard therewith, and desired him to examine him about it, as he came down,  Chapel. Accordingly he did so, and put it very Home to him, remonstrating to him, how dreadful it would be to add the Sin of Suicide, to that of the heinous Murder which he had already perpetrated.</p>
            <p>Jackson at first denied it very obstinately, and on the Gentleman's telling him of the bloody Rags found in his Cell by Charles, said the Reason thereof was, he was troubled with the bloody Flux. However the Gentleman still pressing him yet more earnestly, to acknowledge the Truth, he condescended at last, tho' with great Difficulty, to confess that he had stabb'd himself in the Belly,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103182003"/>
            <p>and pulling up his Shirt, shew'd them the Place. Hereupon a Surgeon was immediately sent for, who having prob'd and dressed his Wound, enquired when, in what Manner, and with what Instrument he had made such a large Gash? His Answer was, that he did it the very Night he was committed to <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-132">

As to the Manner of doing it, he said it was as follows; whilst he sat on the Stairs of the Condemn'd-Hold, he took the Knife with both his Hands extended, and thrust it aslant, with all his Strength, which divided the Umbilical Vessels.</p>
            <p>Accordingly on searching his Cell, the second Time, a large Lump of proud Flesh was found, which he had extirpated from the Navel, being a Sort of Fungous or Excressency, proceeding from the aforesaid Cut, and occasioned by the Wound's not having proper Care taken thereof, immediately after its being given. Hereupon the Surgeon ask'd, how he came to cut off that Part? To which he answered, it was so weighty and troublesome, he could not bear it any longer; adding, that it stunk to that Degree, and was so very offensive, it was intollerable.</p>
            <p>He was then ask'd, if he expected to have saved his Life, by cutting it off; or, whether he thought it would have put him out of Pain: He reply'd, No, but that he did it to case himself, and not to destroy himself; as also, that, if it pleased God to spare his Life, he never would attempt the like again; being willing to be made a public Example, that it might deter others for the future, from committing Murder, a Crime too frequently perpetrated in this City, and for which he was very justly condemn'd.</p>
            <p>He did not live long after making this Discovery, for on Monday the 15th of December, <persName id="OA17410318n17b-1">

            <p>A little before his Decease, he confessed, that he took his Wise out with him with Design to kill her first, and himself afterwards, and had accordingly provided himself with a Pair of Pistols for that Purpose; and that he had failed of his Design, only through the first Pistol's missing Fire; for, after his having shot his Wife dead upon the Spot, the Coachman, who had just set them down, seized him, before he could charge that again, of put fresh Priming to the other, in order to kill himself. This, together with his long Concealment of having stabbed himself, shews that he had long harbour'd a premeditated Intention, not only to murder his Wife, but to commit Suicide (which he at last effected in the Manner before reated) renders it not a little surprizing, what Motives could induce the Jury who sat upon him, to bring in their Verdict Non Compos Mentis, in Consequence of which he was admitted to Christian Burial, and interr'd in the Church Yard belonging to <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-133">

            <p>We think it evident, by the foregoing Circumstances (as has been already observed) that Jackson committed a premeditated Self Murder; but, if this is not sufficient, the following Letter, which was found in his Pocket, after his Decease, puts it in a Manner out of Dispute,  east  our Opinion. It was  For Mrs Jackson, near the Sign of the Red Cross, in Charges street, near Hyde-Park Corner.</p>
            <p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
            <p>THERE is one Thing I beg and crave of you, that is, you make all the Interest you possibly can, leave no Stone unturn'd to grant me the Happiness of being buried with my dear Wife, though in ever so mean a Manner, the meaner the better to my Satisfaction, if it is without a Coffin I am content. If it had pleased God I had got off at my Trial, it was my full Intent to have buried myself with her, as soon as I could find out her Grave, otherwise I had pleaded Guilty, and not have given the Trouble of Trying me. I shall die this Night</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103182004"/>
            <p>with as much Pleasure as I went to be married, being satisfied within myself God. Almighty will forgive me my great and manifold Sins, through the Merits of Jesus Christ. I hope none will reflect on my Behaviour on seeming unconcerned before Company, my Heart was not so, I could cry at others Misfortunes, but hated myself for such an inhuman Crime.</p>
            <p>Dear Mother and Sisters, make yourselves easy, I doubt not, through God's Mercy, I am happier than  this World could make me. The World will blame me for Self Murder; but after reasoning with myself, that I had forfeited my Life, that Blood cries for Blood, I could not think it any Offence to Almighty God, to pay the Debt myself I ow'd my dear Wife; I having more Time than when in a Crowd, to prepare myself for Eternity.</p>
            <p>Pray let the Ordinary of Newgate have a Copy of this Letter; I have left him the Particulars, relating to this unhappy Scene, in another Paper.</p>
            <p>Adieu! dear MOTHER, and SISTERS;</p>

            <p>This other Letter was sent to him after Condemnation, and as it appears with a very Christian Intent, to induce him to prepare for his approaching End; but what little Effect it had upon him, may be seen by what has been already premised, we shall give it our Readers just as it is written, not knowing, either by the Hand, the Spelling, or the Subscribing of the Name, whether it came from a Man or a Woman.</p>
            <p>Friend JACKSON,</p>
            <p>I Sent a Letter to you the thurd of this Instant, but not heareing from you, I cannot tell wither you Reed it or no, so I have Rit to you a gaine, to put you in miend of your greet and of all chang wich you know must be very soon, and therefore I desire you will improve that little Time you have left, in praying to God that he would give you a Harte to repent truely of all your Sins, and that he wold be pleased to parden that haines and bloody Sin of Murder, wich you have been giltey of. Consider what the Rth off an angery God is, and that the Torments off Hell Fiere will be your Punishment for ever World without End; but thiere is Marcey still with God in and by Christ Jesus, who has made a full Satisfaction for all that truely repent and belive in him, for his Blood can wash away all Sin, and as greet Sinners as you are, have found Marcey; but remember you must have a broken and a contrite Hartc or else your Hopes will be vaine. And know, that none can give you that Hart but that God that made you, thierefore pray to him for it, for he has said, who so ever comes unto him, he will in no wise cast out. And now I wish what I have rit may be made of use to you, and if you desire to see me, if you will let me know, I will come to you at any Time, and as often as you would have me. However wither you will see me or no, I will pray for you as long as you are alive, who am your faithful Friend,</p>

            <p>We have nothing farther to add concerning this unfortunate Criminal, who seems, by his Concealment of his Wound for near three Weeks, and not discovering it to the very last, but unwillingly, and by a Sort of Compulsion, to have been a most resolute, harden'd, and obdurate Reprobate; but that, he had one Child by his Wife, which liv'd but eight Months, and was buried in Clerkenwell Parish, near her Father, a CoachMaker; that she was herself interr'd in St. Giles's, where the Murder was committed; and that there seems to have been a Sort of Fatality attending the House where he liv'd; one Man having hang'd himself, and another having drown'd himself out of it, before he compleated the Tragedy, by murdering both. his unhappy Wife and himself.</p>

            <p>AS I am in a few Days to suffer for what I most justly deserved, and am to give an Account to the righteous Judge of all Things for my past wicked Transactions, I thought it a Duty incumbent on me, as I could no other Way make Restitution, to publish an Account of my past mispent miserable Life; I know in doing this, I shall give much Offence to those Persons who have been Partners in my Crimes, and Partakers of ill got Goods; but let them consider 'ere 'tis too late, that the Course they are now pursuing, will one Day or other bring them into my sad State! I know if it was possible to speak with the Tongue of Men and Angels, without they beg of God, and have a sincere Desire to reform my unhappy Exit, as that of many Others before me, will be rather an Encouragement to pursue their wicked Practices, than work in them a Desire of reforming, as I must confess with all the Agonies of Horror, Remorse and anguish of Mind, it was formerly with me! But Oh! that they felt the Racks and Tortures I now do! how would they wish! what would they give! had they reformed by timely Advice. I do sincerely hope that my untimely Exit may be a Warning to all unhappy Persons, and that they would take Example by me, and shun the fatal Rock on which I split. I hope those I have any Ways offended or injured, will forgive my past Transactions, for which I am very sorry, and do heartily repent of; as the following Account contains a sincere and faithful Narrative of my Facts; and the various Methods taken in the Performance of 'em, I hope as I have made a true Discovery, that my Companions will forgive me for so doing; and I beg that God would grant them his Grace and enable them for the future to take to some honest, though ever so mean, an Employ. The Hopes of which has engag'd me to say thus much.</p>

As soon as they had so done, they went to a publick House in order to get some Refreshment before they set out; and as soon as they came in, who should be there but a Person who was sent in Quest of him by his Master; the young Spark was extremely surprized, and would have retreated faster than he came in, but it was too late, for the the Person seized him, and told him he was his Prisoner, and immediately upon this hurry'd him with a great Mob before the Mayor. As soon as they came there (Jenny following him at some Distance, for in the Hurry and Confusion no Body took Notice of her) she heard him confess the Robbery of his Master, but never mention'd one Syllable about her; now just before this Accident, he had given her 10 Guineas, in order to put in a little Purse which she had, the rest of the Money and the Watch being found on him, he was committed to Prison; as soon as Jenny heard this, she went aside to a Publick House and wrote him a Letter, expressing a great Concern for this Misfortune, and promised to return his Things that were pack'd up for London, and likewise the Money which she had of him when it was in her Power; so done, she made the best of her Way to Town, never as she confessed, being the least dismayed at this Accident.</p>

            <p>very genteely dressed, she observ'd a Gentleman who was a very Rum Muns, (that is, a great Beau) who had a very handsome Glim Star, (that is, a Ring) upon his Feme, (that is, Hand) which she longed to make, so giving the Hint to her Companions to Bulk the Muns forward, (that is, Push) they pushed him quite in; whereupon the Meeting being pretty full, as soon as he was in, Jenny held up her Hand to the young Spark, that he might help her forward, which he perceiving, very complaisantly gave her his Hand, in order to assist her, which she readily accepting of, she griped his Hand very fast, and while she had hold of his Hand, the People who were on the outside striving for Entrance, and Jenny's Companions pushing forward, in the Scuffle she squeez'd his Hand so hard, that he was glad to get it away, and did not perceive her take off his Diamond Ring, which as soon as she had effected, she slip'd behind her Companions, saying at the same Time, it is in vain to get in, I'll come another Time, when there's less Crowd; her Companions convey'd her clean off, before the Gentleman had Time to miss his Ring, who called out to stop the Woman, but 'twas too late, for she had brush'd off with the Booty, this gain'd her great Applause amongst her Companions, who now appointed her an equal Share of every Thing they got.</p>
            <p>The next Exploit that Jenny went on was, Slanging the Gentry Mort rumly with a sham Kinchin, that is, (Cutting well the Women big with Child) which was thus perform'd, Jenny had got 2 false Arms made, and Hands, by an ingenious Artist, and dressing herself very genteely, like a Citizen's Wife big with Child, with a Pillow artfully fixed under her Coats for that Purpose, and her Arms fix'd on, she by the Contrivance of the Pillow hid her real ones under her Petticoat, and the artificial ones came across her Belly; Dressed in this Condition, with one of the Gang in the Habit of a Footman, she takes a Chair and goes, (it being on a Sunday Evening) to the Meetinghouse already mention'd  it was so contriv'd by the rest of the Gang, that one should go before as a Scout, and bring Word to the supposed Footman in what Part of the Meeting set the rummest Froes; and likewise to Saweer clearly, (that is, to keep a good look out) that they should have Vid Loges, (repeating Watches) by their Side, that Jenny's Footman might place his Mistress accordingly.Now it was so ordered, that our big-belly'd Ladywas be plac'd in a Pew between 2 elderly Ladies who had both repeating Watches by their Side; she sat very quietly all the Time of the Service, but at the Conclusion of the last Prayer, the Adience being standing, she took both the Ladies Watches off, unperceiv'd by them, and tip'd 'em to one of her Companions, who was was ready planted for the Purpose (and who went and tip'd them to Slang upon the Safe; and then went back to be ready for Business) Now the Congregation breaking up, every body was in a Hurry to get out, and the Gang surrounding the Ladies in order to make a greater Croud, and help Jenny off if she should be smoak'd.</p>
            <p>The two Ladies had no sooner got out of the Pew to the Door, but they missed their Watches, and made a terrible Outcry, which alarmed that Part of the Audience, who enquiring what was the Matter, was answered that the Ladies had lost their Watches, and being asked again who took them, answered, nobody, without the D - l and the big-belly'd Woman had, who was now got far enough off. Nay, says one of the Ladies, that's impossible, for she never moved her Hands from off her Lap, all the Time of the Service. This Accident gathered a great Mob round the Ladies, some enquiring, others confounded at the Strangeness of the Robbery: In the mean while Jenny was slipp'd out to a House hard by, and had alter'd her Dress, and delivered herself of her great Belly, and returned with the utmost Precipitation to her Companions, in order to be assisting in the helping of with more Moveables,who was very busy with the rest of the Crowd, and while they were astonished at the Accident, they took Opportunity to make the Gentleman's Loges and Tales, (or Men's repeating Watches) and to Chive the Froes of their Bungs, (or cut off the Women's Pockets.)</p>
            <p>They were very successful that Day, for no sooner was they got to the Biding (or Place where they divide the Booty) but they examined the Contents of their Booties, which was three Bungs, with Lowers (Purses) in each Lower there were  Ridges (or Guineas) and two Vid Loges. These, with the Money they had got, and 2 Tales (or Swords) amounted to 30 Ridges a Piece, after they had fenced the Loges, &amp;c. which was all carried abroad, and disposed of by R &#8211; J - n, since dead.</p>

            <p>After this Robbery, the Gang consulted together, and thought it proper not to steer that Way for some Time, for Fear of being discover'd. Jenny got so great a Name by this last Affair, that they all swore to act for the future according to her Directions in every Thing, which she thanked them for, and then made the following Speech.</p>
            <p>"It is now 2 Years since I entered into this honourable Society, and I think it is a Duty incumbent upon me to advise for our general Preservation, that the following Articles ought to be made for the Use of our Gang.</p>
            <p>I. That no one else be admitted without the Consent of the whole Gang.</p>
            <p>II. That no one presume to go upon any thing by him or herself upon Pain of being entirely turn'd off, and left to shift.</p>
            <p>III. That if any new Member be propos'd by any of the Gang, that he or she shall be a Month upon Trial, and all that Time shall be instructed at convenient Seasons in the Cant Tongue, so that they may speak intelligibly to nobody but the Gang.</p>
            <p>IV. That if any of the Gang should happen to be taken upon any one Action, that the rest shall stand by him, or her, and swear any thing in order to get such releas'd; and if convicted, a sufficient Allowance to be given him or her in Prison out of the Common Stock, that they may live in a Gentleman or Gentlewoman-like Manner. These Articles were agreed to and fign'd by 'em all"</p>

In that Place, Jenny being well dressed, and her sham great Belly, with one of the Gang in the Habit of a Servant attending her,they took the Opportunity  coming out at Spring Garden Gate, when a great Concourse of People were crouding, for the sham Lady to make a false Step and Stumble  presently  abundance of good-natur'd Gentlemen and Ladies seeing big belly'd Woman ready to fall, was very busy striving who should first lend their Assistance, notwithstanding which, the Lady fairly contriv'd to fall down, and when they went to help her up, she made Signs, and gave 'em to understand that she had so hurt herself by the Fright, that she could not presently recover so as to be able to stand upon her Legs; by this Time more People came up to see what was the Matter, and she had soorder'd it as to fall just in the Middle of the Passage; and while the Croud was gazing on, and commisserating the Case of the poor supposed distressed Lady, the rest of the Gang were very busy in speaking with their Pockets, Diamond Girdle Buckles, &amp;c. They manag'd their Business so dextrously, that they got by this Adventure, two Diamond Girdle Buckles, a Gold Watch, a Gold Snuff Box and two Purses which contain'd upward of twenty Guineas; the next Day the Buckles, Watch, &amp;c. were advertized, and a large Reward offer'd for them; which M - y proposed to restore for the Reward,when Jenny started up and ask'd who would venture Home with them? I, says M - y, would you? do you not consider the Consequence of returning them? why reply'd the other, there is no Questions to be ask'd, What then,replied  Jenny; suppose there is not, apprehend you no farther Consequence than that; no, replied the other; why then resumed Jenny; my Reason is this; suppose you go Home with them and get the Reward offered; here lies the Case, the Parties injured, will, though they ask you no Question, take particular Notice of your Person, and some time or other when you are out upon Business, you may be smoak'd, and then perhaps all may be blown; so my Advice is, that whatever Things may be got, though we can Fence em but for two Thirds of the Value offer'd, yet it is much the safer Way, and less dangerous. This Reason the Gang applauded much, and presently consented to send them to their usual Fence,  (who was one who used to trip over to Holland very often upon the Smuggling Business, and who gave most Money for Goods got in that Manner) and the Gang for the future very seldom made Restitution, but generally dealt with this Fence.</p>
            <p>Some small Time after this last Adventure, 2 of the Gang fell Sick, and were rendered uncapable of turning out upon Business for some Time; now Jenny and her Quondam Spouse were obliged to turn out by themselves upon the Slang mort Lay, (described in the following Adventures Jenny being dressed as a big-belly'd Woman already-mention'd, and her Spouse as a Footman in a Livery, used to take the Opportunity of the Master of the House's Absence in a genteel</p>

            <p>So directly in goes Jenny grunting and groaning as if she was half dead. Down comes the Mistress, and sends the Maid in a hurry up Stairs for the Champer-pot; while she went to fetch the Smelling Bottle. While they were gone, Jenny took the Opportunity of opening the Drawer, and taking out a fine dress'd suit, worth 60 Guineas, which she presently put in a Place made on purpose on the Inside of her large Hoop, and was got sitting in her Chair by the Time the Lady return'd) in a very moving melancholy Posture, pretending to be almost dead. As soon as the Lady came, and her Servant with the Pot, the pretended Footman was ordered into the Kitchen, who had till then attended his Mistress; but out of Decency, was desired to walk down till his Mistress wanted him; while he was in the Kitchen, he took the Opportunity to convey half a dozen Silver Spoons, a Salt, and a Pepper-Box in his Pocket; and as the Lady and her Maid above Stairs were very busy in applying her Smelling-Bottle to Madam's Nose, she took the Opportunity to convey the Lady's Purse out of her Pocket, when she had so done, pretending to be a little Better, ask'd the Lady's Pardon for the extraordinary Trouble she had given her, and returning many Thanks for her great Care and Kindness, desired her Man might be call'd to get a Coach, which he did in a Trice,and order'd the Coachman to drive to Mr. - naming an eminent Merchant near Tower-Street, at the same Time taking Leave of the Lady, and inviting her to the aforesaid Merchant's; but as soon as the Coachman had drove out of Sight, he was order'd to stop, and Madam Jenny pretending, she could not ride easy in a Coach: Here John, says she, give the Coachman a Shilling, and let  about his Business. As soon as this was done, John and his Mistress retreated another Way; and went clean off with the Boory; two or three Facts of this Nature put a Stop to their farther Proceedings; the Circumstances which attended the committing of, being put into the public Papers, so that they thought it safest to desist from any more Tricks of this Nature.</p>
            <p>Some few Days after, Jenny's Companion's recovering, they pursued their old Adventures with great Success; for in less than; Years they acquir'd above 300 Pounds a piece, besides Expences by these illegal Practices.</p>
            <p>About this Time the Gang agreed to go in the Country upon Business there; so they took a Progress down to <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-145">

Here they thought it necessary to admit a new Member. Whom they found at that Place; who was esteemed a good Hand upon The Twang Adam ; that is (could draw him in by a fine Tongue, or Way of talking those, whom they had a Design to impose upon)  they admitted after reading the foremention'd Articles, and swearing him to Secrecy; here it was thought proper to metamo one of them into the Habit of a Servant in  The 2 Women  pass'd for Gentlewomen. Merchants Wives in London, and who had come down to see the Fair, and the 2 Men for Persons who came down as Dealers and in order that they might more safely accomplish their intended Designs, they lodg'd at seperate Places, their Reason for so doing was, that if any of the Gang was detected, the others might appear for their Characters, as Acquaintance accidentally meeting there; they had their Lessons so perfect, that each knew one another's meaning almost by a No One Day the whole Gang being in the Fair, they espyed a West Country Clothier who had just received a Parcel of Money, to the amount of 100 Pounds, which he had given to a Servant, and order'd him to carry it to his Lodgings, and lock it up in his Bureau,and likewise gave him a Key, and bad him return in about an Hour to the Sign of the Fountain, a Tavern in the High-Street. The whole Whole Gang upon this, follows the Fellow and jostles him in the Croud, he falls down but he was so careful of his Bag that they could not get it from him</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103182010"/>
            <p>by this Means; so they were obliged to have recourse to the following Stratagem.</p>
            <p>One of the Gang steps after him out of the Fair, and giving him a Tap of the Shoulder: Friend, says he, did not you part from your Master just now, and did not he order you to go Home with a Bag of Money. Yea, replied the Countryman, and what then? oh! says he, your Master has alter'd his Mind, and is upon the Point of Agreement for some Goods with my Mistress, and desires you will bring it, in order to pay for 'em, at the - naming a House where Jenny and the rest of the Gang were gone to. Oh! moighte weell, moighte weell! says the poor credulous Fellow. I' se go wi you; so Cheek by Jole they go along together.</p>
            <p>,nl&gt;In the mean Time, I -, who was dressed as the supposed Lady's Servant, amused the Countryman with what a handsome rich Lady his Mistress was, and how gloriously he lived with her; and how free she always used him.By this Time they drew towards the House where the rest of the Gang was waiting. When they came there, Jenny's supposed Servant introduced the Countryman (who artfully as they pass'd along, got his Master's Name, unknown to the poor ignorant Fellow.) When they entered the Room, who is this honest Mansays Jenny, Oh! Madam, it is Mr. S - 's Servant, come according to his Master's Orders. Oh! honest Friend says she, sit down, you Master is just gone a little Way, and will return presently, but you must stay till he comes back; Yea, Yea, Madeam, says the Countryman, I shall weat on your Lediship. Come honest Friend says she, will you drink a Glass of Wine; No Ise thank you Madum, Come, Come, don't be bashfull, you shall drink, so pouring out a Glass of Wine, he drank it off; come now you must drink another towards your Master's Health. S'Bleed Madaum, says the Countryman, Ise drink that, thof 'twas a whole Mile to the Bottom; so taking the Glass in his Hand, drank it off; now says Jenny, you must drink my Health, the Countryman with the two first Glasses being pretty much spiritted, chatter'd, ads Waudds, Madam, that Ise do thof it was as deep as the Sea; an I codd - and so off it goes; well done, honest Friend, says Jenny.</p>
            <p>Now every Glass the poor Countryman drank, was mix'd with a certain Quantity of liquid Laudanum.</p>
            <p>As soon as she had done this, Here John, says she, take this honest Fellow, and treat him handsomely till his Master comes, and then I'll send for him in again; so the poor Countryman making twenty aukward Scringes and Scrapes, goes out, and was convey'd to a more close Room convenient for the Purpose, along with his new Acquaintance.</p>
            <p>When they had been there about half an Hour, and drank three or four Glasses of more Wine, the Countryman began to yawn, and in some small Time after, fell fast asleep. As soon ashe perceived this, the Signal was given, and the Gang came in, and took the poor Fellows Bag of Money, paid the Reckoning, and ordered the Servant not to disturb the poor Man, who was weary, but let him have his Nap out. They went away, and going seperately to their Lodgings, they got their Things in Readiness, and then made the best of their Way for <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-146">

            <p>They made so many Things at this Fair, that when they came to Town, and Fenced them, they shared Thirty Pounds a piece, besides Expences.</p>
            <p>By these Means, the Gang supported themselves in the most splendid Manner, sometimes living very profusely, like People of Quality; only they kept up what they term'd a common Stock, to support themselves in Case of any Disaster, which was thus raised. When any Booty was got and sold, a Tenth, Part was put by, to relieve the Gang in Time of Need, and the remaining Part, was equally divided amongst them.</p>
            <p>The usual Places of Jenny and the Gang's Resort in London, when there was no extraordinary Crowd in other Places, was the Change, the Bridge, &amp;c. One Day being upon Business at the last mentioned Place about 5 o'Clock in the Evening, the Gang espy'd a Lady very well dressed, on Foot, walking over, and when she had got about half Way, a sudden Hurry of Carts and Coaches coming over at the same Instant, she stood up at a Door in order to avoid them. One of the Gang, being genteely dressed, steps up at the same Time, and says, Have a Care, Madam; and so standing before her, catches hold of both her Arms, that she should not be at Liberty to Tout the rest, and holds them up: In the mean Time</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103182011"/>
            <p>Jenny, and the rest of the Gang, were very busy with her, and they was so dexterous, that before the Coaches got by, they made her Pocket, and walked off with it. As soon as the Hurry was over, the Lady dropp'd the supposed Gentleman a fine Curtsey, and humbly thank'd him for his great Care, and so took her Leave, little dreaming of her Loss; for they found in the Pocket upwards of 30 Guineas, a gold Snuff box worth 6 Guineas, and a Case of silver Instruments.</p>

They lodged in this Place, that they might be the readier to attend the Theatre, and convey their Booties soonest off.</p>
            <p>One Night when his Majesty was at the Play-House, the Gang dressed Jenny up very gay, like a Person of Quality, and going in a Chair with her Footman before her, she got a Place in the Middle of the front Boxes but having no Opportunity to do any Thing while the Play was performing, she came our before the Entertainment was over, handed by a young Beau, whom she had pick'd up. She sounding him, found him a Country young Gentleman, lately come from York.</p>
            <p>The Spark being very much enamour'd with his new Mistress, desired the Honour of conducting her Home to her Lodgings. Laird, Sir, says she, that's impossible, for, I am married, and if I should let a strange Gentleman wait upon me Home, what do you think my Spose would say? Then, Madam, quoth the Youngster, permit me the Pleasure of waiting on you to drink a Glass of Wine. Sir, says she, it is what I don't care to do, but added with a Sigh, if I thought you was Man of Honour, I durst venture to drink a Glass of Wine, for sure there is no Harm in that, but am told that there is so few Men of Honour, it hard trusting. Madam, reply'd the enamoured ark eagerly, I would sooner kill myself than  your Reputation. With this last Expression any seemed to be overcome, and went with the ark to the Rose, the Corner, of the Theatre,  calling for a Room, he said a hundred fine Things to his new Acquaintance. After Jenny had drank a Glass, and sat a Quarter of an Hour, she seemed uneasy, and wanted to be gone Our Spark used many Intreaties for her Stay, but in vain , for she positively insisted upon going (for as yet she had not given the Gang necessary Directions upon this new Affair, so to be sure she could not stay) then the young Spark insisted upon going with her, but she begged he would not trouble himself, yet with much Intreaty on his Side, this last Requst was, with some seeming Difficulty, granted.</p>
            <p>Then he called the Drawer, and ordered a Hackney Coach to be got ready, and handed the Lady in with much Complisance. Jenny order'd the Coachman to drive slowly to her Lodgings, naming the Place where she lived, and as they were going Home, he pressed hard for the Pleasure of seeing her again. She told him, she expected her Husband would be out of Town in two or three Days, and in that Time he might call upon her. By this Time the Coach came to the Door, so Jenny requesting the Favour, that the Spark would sit still till she got out, and get himself out at some other Place for fear of her Husband, she would be glad to see him in two or three Days, and in that Time prepare for his Reception.</p>
            <p>The young Gallant, so overjoy'd, took his Leave; so Jenny got out of the Coach, and going up Stairs, found the Gang come there before, for it seems the Signal was for her to stay till the Play was done, an she coming out before, they had missed her. As soon as she entered the Room they began to upbraid her, for being out of the Way, for it seems by wanting her  they lost then Right Hand,for they made but one Gold Snuff-Box that Night; but the soon pacified them, by telling them her Adventure, and what she intended to do, the appointed Evening being come, in which Jenny's Spark was to appear, he came dressed very gay with a gold Watch in his Pocket, a gold hilted Sword by his Side, a Diamond Ring upon his Finger, and a Gold headed Cane dangling in his Hand.</p>
            <p>Jenny being ready to receive him, had dressed up two of the Gang in rich Liveries, and M - and her waiting Woman very gay, and the Lodgings being genteel, all Things seemed to look very grand.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103182012"/>
            <p>The young Suark seeing this Grandeur, seemed quite amazed, and to be sure thought er some Person of Quality, as he afterwards privately told her by and by up comes a Bottle of Wine, and some rich Sweetmeats, then the Footman was ordered to withdraw. Now Sir, says Jenny, you must think I have a great Respect for you, to be  with you in this manner, I hope you are a Gentleman of more Honour than to tattle of a Lady's Favours. The young Gentleman reply'd, by would sooner cut his Tongue out; after some small Discourse, Jenny gave him to understand, that she did not expect her Husband till very late  Evening, so the Spark begged hard, that  that Time, she would make him happy in her Arms; in short, she so contriv'd Matters that  made him believe none of her Servants knew any Thing of the Affair of his Stay, except her;  Chambermaid and Confident; so conducting him into her Bedchamber, the young Spark  to enjoy his Mistress, soon slipped off his Cloaths and got into Bed, she pulled hers off  slowly pretending to be very bashful, upon which he jump'd out of Bed in order to assist her,  unbuckling her Shoes, she pretending , catched hold of his Hand, and  to admire his Ring, took it off his Finger and put it upon hers; as soon as she had got  the Signal was given from the supposed Maid, who knock'd at the Door, and told her that her Master was come Home: Jenny immediately  out of Bed, Lord!says what shall I do, I am inevitably ruin'd! Madam, says her Lover, what shall I do? On Sir! says she, I have  into Bed and cover yourself all over Head  Ears, and I'll take your Cloaths and hide 'em, least perchance he should take it into his Head to come into this Room, and in the mean Time I'll go and persuade him that I'm not well, and perhaps I can make him lie by himself to Night, which if I do than I can have the Pleasure of being with your this Evening.</p>
            <p>The Spark immediately did as he was ordered, and Jenny slipp'd on her Night Gown, &amp;c. and went out of the Room, and lock'd the Door after her when she came into the Place where the rest of the Gang was, they held a Consultation; the result of which was, immediately to quit the lodgings and leave poor Pill Garlick in the Lurch, which was immediately put in Execution, and the poor unfortunate Enamoretta left locked up by himself,who no Doubt cursed his new Acquaintance, which for the future 'tis thought gave him a Caution how he enter'd into Intreagues of this Nature; they examined the Contents of this Booty, which amounted when the Moveables was Fenced to 250 l. Now Jenny had the greatest Share of this Booty, because she did the most Execution; her Share coming to upwards of 50 l.</p>
            <p>After this Robbery the Gang retired into the Country, where they carried on their Adventures very successfully for the Space of half a Year, when coming to Town they pursued their old Courses as Occasion offered.</p>

            <p>In these Employments I might have done very well, had not Gaming and bad Company (which are the sole Ruin of Youth) drawn off my Attention from Business, and plunged me into such Extravagance, that I soon acquired the Name of Mr. EPICURE. When my Wife was living I used to frequent the Play-house every Night, and have often given a Guinea for a Quart of Pease, 7 s. for a Gill of Strawberries, and 5 s. a piece for Cucumbers; in short, nothing would suit my voluptuous Taste, except in its greatest Bloom and Glory, and when it bore the highest Price.</p>
            <p>I own that I robb'd Mr. Dalbey on Saturday the 29th of Nov. of two Shop Books and a Leidger, and on his advertising 2 Shop Books only, I sent a Buckle-Chafe-Maker, who lives in Water-Lane, with the two Shop Books, expecting to get the Reward which was offered, and kept the Leidger myself, intending to receive the Debts which it contained; but on examining it, I found nothing in it for my Purpose; so on the Monday Night following, I committed it to the Flames, in the House of a Person who was concerned with one in the Commission of the Robbery.</p>

            <p>When I was seized I did not apprehend that I should be committed for this Fact, but imagining that I should be searched for Arms, I privately pulled them out of my Pocket, likewise some Powder and Ball out of my Breeches, and concealed them under a Bench in the House; but recollecting that if I was carryed before Col. Deveil, I should certainly be detain'd on Parish's Account, and that these Pistols might be of Service to me in Prison, I dropp'd my Hat, and on Pretence of stooping for that, I conveyed them into it, and brought them away with me.</p>
            <p>When we had staid drinking some Time, seemingly very friendly, I was put into a Coach, in order to be carry'd before the sitting Alderman at Guild Hall, and as we came through <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-160">

            <p>I likewise own, that I put his Watch into his Coat Pocket, after the Woman had robb'd him of it, imagining that the Loss of his Watch might, when he went Home, create some Uneasiness between him and his Wife, and might sooner be miss'd than a large Sum of Money.</p>

            <p>When I had rifled Parish this second Time, I left him, and return'd to Keogh's House, where I had lodged about three Weeks, and gave Keogh all the Money, in order for Distribution among the Persons who were concerned with me, thinking it was sweet, and that we should never hear more of Parish; but he was taken up by the Watchmen, and by them brought into <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-163">

I was looking out of the Window at the same Time, and saw the Watchmen carry him off, in Order to go with him to his Inn; but for drinking with him in any House afterwards, I deny that I ever did.</p>
            <p>Before I was confined for Mr. Dalbey's Affair, Keogh sent for me, and gave me a Guinea of Parish's Money, which is all that I ever had of it, for Keogh and his Wife, on hearing of the Warrant of Detainer against me, ran away to Ireland with the rest of the Money.</p>

            <p>DEAR MOTHER,</p>
            <p>IT is not difficult to conceive the great Trouble you consequently must be in, on Account of my unhappy Condition; but we ought in all Things to submit the Will of that Being, who is, and ever will be our Portion and Hope, when all earthly Vanities fail and forsake us.</p>
            <p>Is it not from his Divine Hand, that we receive our Life, and all that is valuable and dear to us?</p>
            <p>It is then absolutely necessary, that we should be entirely at his Disposal, and not murmur at any Thing he is pleased to lay on us, for St. Paul teacheth us, That the Afflictions of this World are in themselves light, and purchase for us a far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.</p>
            <p>With the utmost Regret and Sorrow, I now look back on my past mispent Life, and that I have made so bad a Use of that Education, which you, out of your extream Tenderness, bestowed on me; and must</p>

            <p>own, that it is through my own Folly and Rashness, that I have plunged both myself and you into this Sea of Affliction. But I trust thar the Divine Being will extricate me out of all Trouble, and sorrly Receive my Soul into Everlasting Happiness.</p>
            <p>That you may continually be under the Divine Care and Protection; that he may be your Comforter in all your Afflictions; and when you shall be called hence and no more seen, you may be hapyy in that World, where here shall be no Weeping, Sorrow nor Pain, and whose Joys knows no End, is the hearty Prayer of</p>
            <p>Your Dying Son,</p>

Monck of Stratford, and some other Gentlemen, being with this Criminal on Monday last, to desire he would speak the Truth concerning an Accusation of Deer-stealing, severely, prosecuted in Essex against that Gentleman and another, on his single Evidence. He deferr'd the giving any such Account till Wednesday Morning, when he desired Mr. Bayes, of the Green-Man at Epping-Forest, to attend him, and promised to make a full and free Confession.

Some Horsemen coming up, and Mr. Hill telling them his Cafe, they readily agreed to go in quest of the Robbers. Mr. Hill sat down his Wife at an Alehouse, and went with them thither; in about two Hours after William came to ask his Way; John who was on Foot, and more readily knowing the Country made his Escape. As soon as Mrs. Hill had Sight of the Man,  old some Persons who were drinking in the House, that this was one of the Rogues. They run out immediately, seized his Bridle, and before he could hindle his Pistol, (which, with the Horse were his Brothers) they got the better of him, Carried him to a Justice, and he was committed to <placeName id="OA17410318-geo-197">

            <p> after this, the Prisoner went to Mr.  and desired to have a little Talk with him  so going into a Field, adjoining, Sir, says  threatened to be taken up for a High- Robbery, I had the Fortune to find some Things  between Grave and Orser, and some  People say I did not come by them honestly. What must I do  John, says the Gentleman, if you did find them, you came by them honestly enough no  can hurt you, you need fear nothing. Upon this they parted,</p>
            <p>within a Day or two from this, Mr. Monck being at London, the Town Farrier who shoes his  coming to him one Morning, asked it he had heard of this Robbery between Gray's and Orset? he answered, No; but the Farrier's Question alarmed him, and he began to suspect that David was the Man; so he resolv'd to send an Account of this Conversation, and a Description of his Person  Mr. Hill, who  back Wrd, that he was certainly the Man, and prayed he might be seized. Mr. Monck had him secur'd, and Mr. Hill swore to him, upon which he was committed to the Compter; where he contrived the Information against Mr. Collcut and Monck, partly out of Revenge, and partly to destroy any Evidence that Mr. Monck might give against him.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday Evening, the Night before his Execution, he desired to speak with the Printer of the Dying-Speeches, who being come Sir, says he, I have something to tell you which gives me great Uneasiness, and I beg you would insert it in your Paper, to do Justice to those injured Persons, whom (as I am a dying Man, and am shortly to appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, to answer for my wicked Actions) I have basely wronged.</p>
            <p>Sometime since, at the Instigation of a Noble Lord's Bailiff (whom he named) I swore falsly against that worthy Gentleman Mr. Collcut of Hounsditch, late deceased, and his Son-in-law Mr. Monck, for Deer Stealing; for which I heartily ask Pardon and Forgiveness of Mr. Monck, and I hope God of his infinite Mercy will forgive me, as I do all the World.</p>

            <p>AS I am sensible the World will reflect of a poor Wretch who makes his Exit in the unhappy Manner I shall in a few Days do, I thought it necessary to say something of myself, in order that Persons may not think me guilty of Crimes I did not actually commit; these Reflections joined with those of making Restitution for past Offences, as the latter's entirely out of my Power, I hope the World will forgive me for publishing this of myself; for I can only at present discover the various Methods I took to defraud his Majesty and his Subjects, which I heartily repent of, and hope God will forgive me; as on the other Hand I forgive all the World, and die in Peace with Mankind. To begin it will be unnecessary to give no Account of my Parents, by Reason they are not answerable for my Transactions, therefore nothing very material happening till I came to the Age of Man, I shall recount my Adventures from that Time.</p>
            <p>The first Acquaintance I had was with one R - who let me into the Method of Smuggling Goods from Holland, and in order that we might the more safely carry on our concerted Schemes, 3 more of the same Inclination as myself, after we had taken an Oath of Secrecy, subscrib'd to the following Articles.</p>
            <p>Imprimis, That we should stand by one another till Death, not fearing to spill the last Drop of Blood in Defence of our Companions.</p>
            <p>II. That no one of the Gang, should hazard any Thing by himself on Pain of being discarded by the rest.</p>
            <p>III. That we should know where to find each other at an Hours Warning.</p>
            <p>IV. That if any of the Gang should happen, to be taken, that the rest should rescue him if</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103182019"/>
            <p>possible, if not to allow him a sufficient Maintenance to support him during the Time of his Confinement.</p>
            <p>These Articles we all swore to very solemnly, and then we consulted in what manner to proceed, and arm'd ourselves with Pistols and Cutlasses, that we might be able to make a resolute Defence in Case of an Attack. Our first Contrivance to bilk the Officers was perform'd in the following Manner; we had a Quantity of Tea, and knowing the Officers would be in Pursuit of us, we loaded several Horses, and concealed them in a Field near the Road Side, about 3 Miles from Lewis in Sussex, five of us being ready likewise concealed along with them; we had order'd two of our Companions to go forward, who had two Horses lightly loaded with Tea, as judging whereabouts the Officers would lay in wait for us. It happen'd according to our Expectation, for our Companions had not got above half a Mile from us, before they espyed the Officers coming to give them a Salute, which they being aware of, pretended to fly; and while they were in pursuit of them, we took our Opportunity to convey our Goods into the Town, and planted them safe before they could have any Intelligence of us. But to return to our Companions, they had led the Officers in Chase a long Time, 'till being afraid of giving them too great an Opportunity, they threw their Loads of their Horses, and giving them a Spur, soon got clear, by Reason the Pursuers staid to take the Prize, which was about an Ct. and a half of Tea, whilst we made sure of upwards of 1800 lb. We by such Methods as these, we carry'd on our fraudulent Practices very successfully for some Time, till at last they had better Intelligence of us, and came up to us when we had got a Waggon Load of Goods; but finding us ver, resolute, they thought it adviseable to desist, and let us carry off our Booty, tho we had a skirmish, and in this Action I lost my Horse; they sent a Spy after us unperceived, who brought them Intelligence where we went, and we had like to have lost our Booty, but one of our People being vigilant, brought us Intelligence of our being smoaked, and about that Time we had admitted 10 more into our Number, so thought ourselves able to make a vigorous Defence; and accordingly taking our Goods into the middle of a Field, they came up to us, but finding our Number increased, only a slight Encounter happen'd, in which Action the rest of our Gang happening to approve of my Courage, honoured me with the Name of Captain, a very glorious Title I thought at that Time, but since find to my fatal Cost a very unhappy Title it proved to me.</p>
            <p>We now begun to grow so daring, that it was thought necessary to reinforce the Officers with more Men, in order to put a Stop to our Proceedings; but we having Intelligence, had recourse to Fraud, and so still managed our Matters very well. I cannot help taking Notice here, that we thought ourselves in no unjustifiable Actions, tho' unlawful ones, and I was so unhappy as to imagine, that our Crimes we were committing every Day, was not contrary to the Laws of Reason and Nature, tho' to those of Man; (though if he had a right Sense of Things, he would have known, that it was as much Injustice, as to rob on the Highway, or do any other Action which might justly incense the Civil Government to cut him off as an ill Weed.)</p>
            <p>There happen'd during the Course of our illegal Actions, to come a Person into the Country who kept his Coach, him some of our Gang having a Knowledge of he bought 400 wt. of Tea of us, which he concealed in the Seats, and other Parts of the Coach very artfully, as judging no Person would suspect him; but he was  for 3 or 4 of our Gang, and myself agreed to go and make Information against him, which we accordingly did, and after he had paid us our Money twice, I thought this a very bad Action to serve him in this manner, and heartily ask his Pardon for so doing.</p>
            <p>One Time we had a Quantity of Tea lodg'd at a certain Place near Lewis, and fearing   who was then pretty much about,  it out, we call'd a Consultation, and agreed in order to divert their pursuit, to use the following Stratagem. We got a Quantity of Bags, which we iffed with Hay. Straw,  and ty'd, them hard down, and when we had so done; we convey'd them to a certain empty House. As soon as we had done this, two of my Companions and I went to the Officers, and pretending we had a Quarrel with the rest, we would Discover where they might seize a very large Quantity of Tea; now they being before apprehend of our real Booty, thought  sure, so sent one of their Friends along with  to see the Place, and </p>
            <p>So ten of our Companions being  for the Purpose,  pretended to give  sent with us his Cue, whom was told  introduced as our Friends, the poor  Fellow obey'd us exactly  we came to the appointed Place, he was introdu</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174103182020"/>
            <p>ced accordingly. When he came to the Room,  mark'd 100 wt.  wt. and a half, so that it seem'd  when he had  thought  4  back to the  Person they sent, continued  so they preparing  being about twenty in Number, we  be absent, left our Companions  suspects,  readily agreed to, so  here gone  more of our Company, went and con the real  having  ten Company  imaginary one, who  for they soon  opened  they  for the  Time, upward </p>

            <p>N. B. A horrid and villainous Design was on  to rescue the late Criminals out of Goa,  in the Dead-Warrant, by a Body of Smugglers and Irish, and tended to be  in Execution on Tuesday, being St. Patrick's Day, which was, the Day before the Malefactors were to die. Some few Days before they were to luster, Quail, one, of the condemn'd Persons, gave an Information, to the Head Keeper, That Catt, the noted Smuggler, said he could for his Part, raise a Posse; and likewise Hunt and Cassody said, they could raise among the Irish to the Number of 40, or more, in order to rescue them out of the abovesaid Goal, which was to be done in the following Manner,  by killing the Person who kept the outward Door of the Press Yard, by which they would be Master of the Key; and then to Murder the Head Keeper (and any Gentleman that might be with him) and the Runner who are  to the Place This information was confirm'd to the Head Keeper  <persName id="OA17410318n158b-1">
