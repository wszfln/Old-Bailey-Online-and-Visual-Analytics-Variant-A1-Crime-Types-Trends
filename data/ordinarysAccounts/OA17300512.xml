            <p>While under Sentence, they were instructed in the first Principles of Religion, both in Publick and Private: Some of them having been grossly Ignorant, (partly for want of Education, and partly by Reason of their obstinate and unadviseable Tempers) whether in natural or revealed Maxims. From St. John, 1. 12. 13. But as many as received him, to them gave he Power to become the Sons of God; even to them that believe on his Name: which were born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Flesh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God. I took Occasion to shew them the absolute Necessity of believing in Christ, as the Son of God, the true Messias, and only Saviour of lost Man, since we, by Sin and our Apostacy from God, having lost all Power of satisfying divine Justice, it is Necessary for us to endeavour to attain to the imputed Righteousness of Christ Jesus, by a lively Faith in him, who by his Sufferings and Death hath made a perfect Attonement for the Sins of all Men. I shew'd them, that their attacking, beating, frightning and robbing upon the Highway, was a Sin bordering upon Murder, which they will also commit, when they think upon being discover'd and brought to Justice by the injur'd Party; and therefore those who were guilty of Robbery, ought to repent as if they had committed Murder. I instructed them in the Nature of the Christian Sacraments, that they being Pledges of the divine Love, and Seals of the new Covenant; the worthy and faithful Receivers are made Partakers of the invisible Grace signify'd thereby, Pardon of their Sins and eternal Life. As from several other Texts, so particularly from Rev. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord; yea, saith the Spirit, from henceforth, that they may rest from their Labours and their Works do follow them. I used several Exhortations to prepare them for their great Change; since upon the Conclusion of their Life by Death, depended their eternal Welfare or Misery in the other World.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17300512n6-2" type="given" value="ABRAHAM"/>Jonas</persName>, was an obstinate and irreclaimable Jew: I endeavour'd to perswade him to believe in Christ as the only Saviour of Sinners, by shewing that Jesus of Nazareth was the true Messias, as being the only Person, in whom all the Prophecies of the old Testament concerning the Messias were fulfill'd, in respect he was the Seed of the Woman, who bruis'd the Head of the Serpent, i. e. who destroy'd the Kingdom of Satan, as was evident at the Time of our Saviour's Appearance, for then the Heathen Oracles ceas'd, and Christ was declar'd to be the Son of God with Power by his Resurrection from the Dead, and by many other infallible Miracles, the greatest of all which was, that by the means of twelve illiterate Fishermen, in a very short Compass of Time, without any external Violence or Force, a great Part of the World, in the most remote and farthest distant Regions, were converted to the Faith of Jesus, and willingly submited their Necks to the Yoke of Christ and own'd his Cross. But whatever could be said on this Subject, he appear'd still Inflexible, and gave a general Answer, that he would acknowledge none of these things, and that there had been abundance of wise Men of their Nation, who represented the Scripture in another View.</p>
            <p>When these and other Exhortations were given, they attended in Chapel and made regular Responses, as they could; they were in a better State of Health, than commonly such miserable Objects use to be, when they are kept so long under Sentence; only Horton and the Woman were a little indispos'd, but recover'd very soon, and fail'd not in giving their usual Attendance. Dalton was very observant in attending Chapel, and comply'd with Prayers, and was more attentive to Exhortations, then Men use to be in his unhappy Condition; only once, the Woman under Sentence having given him some sharp Words, upon his stopping her at the Door of the Cells, as she intended (as he alledg'd) to make her Escape, which (I believe) was impracticable; he was a little uneasy to her in Chapel, and threatn'd to cut off her Head, or beat her unmercifully if she spoke to him again on that Subject. He said, he knew nothing of her Intention to make an Escape in her Hood and Mantle, or else he would not have stopp'd her. I advis'd him to be Patient, that he would forbear such desperate Resolutions, and consider his present Circumstances: He said, he would not be displeas'd at his being blam'd for what he did, but could not endure to bear the Blame of what he had not done; but as for what he said to the Woman, that it was only for Terror, not that he design'd to do any such thing.</p>
            <p>Abraham the Jew came mostly to Chapel, but more for a little Freedom, than any love he had to the Devotion; appearing altogether indifferent that way, only sometimes he look'd a little on his Hebrew Psalter, and on Ascension day he sung aloud the one half of the</p>

            <p>24th Psalm, and the last part of the Doxology, for I observ'd that he did not sing the first part of it, along with the rest. I endeavour'd to persuade him to the belief of Christianity; but, although he had little or nothing to say, he persisted inflexible. <persName id="OA17300512n9-1">

Bank Note, out of which he paid 5 l. that was owing to his Landlord, Mr. Marlow: And therefore he inclos'd in a Sheet of Paper the rest of the Papers thus found, directed them to the Post Master General, laid them down in <placeName id="OA17300512-geo-14">

He reflected much upon the Evidence against him, alledg'd that he often advis'd him to Adventure upon no purchase, no pay, and particularly to rob the Bristol Mail, which would make their Fortune at once, but that he always had the Grace to resist his wicked Proposals. This was the Substance of Mr. Burton's Evidence against him reversed. He pretended to disprove the Evidence, but in this he fail'd, and particularly in alledging that the Officers and others of the Life-Guard would appear in his Favour, for not one of them was to be seen in Court but one Gentleman, whom he call'd against his Will, and who did him more harm than good, for he declar'd that he serv'd in the Troop of Guards with him, but as to his Character he knew nothing of it, save that he was put out of the Troop upon Suspicion of Theft. He reflected upon his being convicted upon Circumstances, without positive Proof. I told him that it was altogether improbable, that any Person who had hazarded his Life in such a wicked and dangerous Attempt, as attacking, binding and threatening to murder the Post-Boy, and carrying away the Bristol Mail, and then laying it down any where for another to reap the profit, he said that they had laid a Trap for him, but could not positively say, that the Witnesses bore him any Ill-will, only he mention'd the great Reward laid upon his Head. I Represented to him the Necessity of a Free Confession from many Topicks, as the command of God, Scripture Precept and Example; and the Expediency of it, as being commonly the only Satisfaction can be given to the injur'd Party: &amp;c. he appear'd to be a Man of a sullen reserv'd Temper, and after all could be said would give no further Account of that Affair. He seem'd always to be very Devout and Serious, declar'd that he believ'd in Christ Jesus, as the Son of God and only Saviour of Sinners, through whose Merits he hop'd for Salvation; that he sincerely repented of all his Sins, and died in Peace with all Mankind, and an unworthy Member of the Church of England.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17300512n18-1" type="given" value="JAMES"/>James Dalton</persName>, as he said, about 30 Years of Age, of Parents, who had a very indifferent Character, for his Father was an Irishman, and a Taylor in Dublin, whence he went to the Wars in Flanders, and was advanced to be a Serjeant; he afterwards came to London, liv'd here for some Time, by gaming and biting, till some Years ago one swore a Robbery upon him, for which he was executed. His Mother, after the Death of his Father, marry'd a Butcher, and was some Time since transported for some felonious Fact, and she now lives in some of these foreign Places, where she may have Leisure to lament the Fate of herself and her deserving Family; for they say that a Sister of his is likewise transported. Dalton being the Son of such a notable Family, one may easily conjecture what Sort of a Tree grows from such a Stock. However, while his Parents liv'd in any Credit, they put their Son James to School, where he was so unruly, that his Master put him out of School; he went to two other Schools, in the last of which he rob'd the Maid, but was immediately found out, which prevented his doing any further Mischief there: Dalton was a Thief from his Cradle, and imbib'd the Principles of Art from his Mothers Milk. He went between his Father's Legs in the Cart, to his fatal Exit at Tyburn; and it seems he intended to outvie him in Wickedness, for he said his Father was not a down-right Thief, but one of the most notorious Cheats at Cards of any Man in Europe, which Talent if he had improved as some others have done, and had not met with some Sharpers, who did not think upon being choused out of their Money at such an easy Rate, possibly he might have been still living: But James who was both Heir of his Fortune and good Qualities, took himself directly to all Manner of Theft and Robbery, and as he himself said was one of the most impudent irreclaimable Thieves that ever was in England.</p>
            <p>He took ten Guineas from a certain Person in Town to swear falsly against one Nichols, who was executed with the Street Robbers upon Neaves's Evidence, but said that his Conscience check'd him for engaging to do such an unjust Action, and he would neither return the Money nor appear as Evidence against him; he begg'd God Pardon for undertaking so villainous a Design.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173005120004"/>
            <p>He behav'd always Civily in Chapel and at other Times, for what I know, except in one single Instance before-mention'd. He profess'd himself Penitent, that he believ'd in Christ, and died in Peace with all the World. As for the Crime for which he suffer'd, he absolutely deny'd it, and after all the Arguments could be used, he would not alter in his Confession; but reflected on his Prosecutor as one no less Wicked than himself: However, he freely forgave him; and often own'd to me, that for twenty Years past he never rose out of his Bed, but he deserv'd the Gallows. His Carriage was much more Modest and Civil, than that of several of those notorious Offenders useth to be.</p>

He had more Knowledge of the Hebrew Language than many of the Jews have, and writ the Characters very well. He had wild extravagant Notions about the Messias, as that he was to come down from Heaven at the End of the World, and to make all Men happy of what Sect or Profession soever they were. He knew little or nothing of the Scripture, only he read the Psalter, and some Jewish Prayer-books, and had some confus'd Notions of the rabbinical Legends and Romances, no way founded on Scripture.

He was very Ignorant; I did what I could to instruct him, but he was slow of Understanding, and could not attain to much Knowledge. He wept and cried bitterly like a Child, when I spoke to him in Private. He repented of his Sins, believed in Christ, and died in Peace with all Mankind.</p>

He profess'd his Faith in Christ, his Penitence for Sin, and that he died in Peace with all Mankind.</p>
            <p>At the Place of EXECUTION,</p>
            <p>ABRAHAM the Jew, had some of his Nation speaking and reading a little to him in Hebrew; before I could get to pray for the rest. He said he had nothing more to say, only shew'd me a little Hebrew Prayer Book he was reading in. He seem'd to be very uncharitable to his Prosecutors when there was no Expectation of Life. I ask'd him if he freely forgave his Enemies? He hesitated upon this, and did not know if it was agreeable to their Religion, but answer'd faintly, he did. At another Time he prayed God might Reward them as they had dealt by him. Mr. Aubert had no more to say, only that he had given Satisfaction to one who had come to him several Days about an Affair. <persName id="OA17300512n27-1">

They went off crying to God for Mercy.</p>

That by the Time they came to him, he was dead, although they had been with him about twenty Minutes before, when he was with apparent Devotion praying and singing Psalms.
