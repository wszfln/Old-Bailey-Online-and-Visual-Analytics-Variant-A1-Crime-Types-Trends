He was brought up well for the Son of People of an ordinary Station in Life, and says he might have done well, had he pursued those Instructions which they caused him to be furnished with in his early Days. He served his Apprenticeship of seven Years faithfully, and worked as Journeyman very diligently for some Time after, till he had saved some Money; and getting married, set up in Business for himself, to try his Fortune in the World, and had two Apprentices when he was taken into Custody upon Account of the Fact for which he suffered; one of them he turned over to another Master, since his Confinement in <placeName id="OA17510617-geo-5">

            <p>In our first Conversation he said he had lived a very orderly Life, and constantly attended his Duty to God in the Church, scarce ever absenting himself on a Sunday; but that latterly indeed he had forsaken his God, and he seared God had forsaken him. It pleased God, he says, to afflict him with Sickness, of which he thought he should have died; in the Time of which Affliction he had considered his Ways, and found himself very much wanting in his Duty. He then made faint Resolutions of Amendment, but afterwards forgot that God had been gracious unto him, and returned to as bad, if not worse Practices, than before he had been used to. He owned thus far; that he had forsaken God and Religion, and given himself up to Idleness and Drunkenness, the Fountain of Iniquity of all Kinds, to loose and disorderly Company, and to Gaming. He pretended however he had never wronged any Body, and persisted to the last to declare he took the Purse only in a Jest, intending to give Mrs. Duncombe a Caution to be more careful for the future; and gives an Account of the Transaction, under his own Hand, in the following Manner. He behaved well under Sentence of Death in the general, had at Times great Reluctance, and shewed Marks of Contrition.</p>

I sat down to drink my Beer, and in came Litchfield, Corbet, Smith, Jackson, and one Gordon; Litchfield went away, and left the rest; Smith and Corbet went to Cards, and Wine came in plentifully. I being a Neighbour, was desired to take Part, which I did. About Two o'Clock Mrs. Duncombs took her Purse, and dropt it over the Bar, I believe, in the Sight of all, except Jackson, who was drunk, and asleep on the Ground, notwithstanding he took upon him to swear hard against me, and was scarce able to stand or sit upon a Chair. I seeing Mrs. Duncombe so careless, and for no other Reason than to make her careful another Time, took the Purse, thinking it was Silver, (and not imagining a Sum of that Consequence would be so heedlessly handled) took it, and went and laid it on a Bulk, (which, by the bye, was his own Wife's Green-Stall) a few Yards from Duncombe's Door. Mrs. Duncombe missing the Purse, cried out, I have lost twenty-three Guineas; which frightened me almost out of my Senses, and she called her Husband. I denied the taking of it, and desired the Servant to call my Wife, thinking to get her to bring the Purse, and drop it in the Bar, or thereabouts; for, when I heard of the Sum, my Heart melted within me. Mr. Duncombe said, There's no Occasion to call any Body, it is a Joke, and I will give a Bottle of Wine, and a free Pardon, and Thanks to him that will give an Account of it. I was very glad to hear that, and called him Backwards into the Yard, and said, Mr.</p>

            <p>Duncombe, I am sorry I should jest with such edged Tools, I little thought the Contents, but as I am a Neighbour, and live in Credit, pray let it go no farther; he said it should not; I told him where it was, and sent him for it. The Purse he had intire, and brought in a Bottle of Wine; and shook Hands; and, to all Appearance, were good Friends, as formerly, I having used his House ever since he kept it. And when he went to take Ship to go to Scotland, and carried a great Charge of Money, he chose me to conduct him, at Midnight, from <placeName id="OA17510617-geo-6">

I really loved him, and would have done him any Service, as soon as I would have done it for myself; but a Person in Company, Corbet by Name, said we could not make the Matter up without going before a Justice. We agreed to go, Mr. Duncombe, myself, and another, privately. We did so, and Mr. Duncombe told the Justice, who lives near Golden Square, St. James's, that it was a Jest, but that he wanted to be safe, and we were recommended to give general Releases. While my Wife was gone to get Releases drawn, an inveterate Enemy of mine came into the publick House where we were waiting, who called Mr. Duncombe out, and persuaded him to go to another Justice, and take out a Warrant for me, and before my Wife came back with the Releases, they had served a Warrant on me; and although we were within five or six Doors of the aforesaid Justice, they were ashamed to take me there, but took me about a Mile to another, by whom I was committed, although before recommended for Releases by the other. It plainly appears I had no Intent to keep the Purse or Contents for several Reasons: As first, No Person could lay it on me more than another, for there were four Persons in the House besides myself, and, as I am a dying Man, I never had a Thought of defrauding him of a Shilling. Secondly, I, as a Friend and Neighbour, have been Night and Day entrusted in his House, all the same as his Brother, and he never lost any thing as I ever heard of. Lastly, My Circumstances were not so bad as to cause me to do an ill Action, for I kept two Shops, one at <placeName id="OA17510617-geo-8">

When this great Misfortune happened to me, I worked for a great many noble Families, and I praise God, wherever I worked there was nothing lost. That unhappy Day, the 13th of March, I had been part of it at work at a worthy Gentleman's, and was weary, and wanting a Pint of Beer before I went to Bed, could not be content to have it at Home with my Family, but must unfortunately go to the House, whereby I put myself in the Way of this great Misfortune, and if it be the Will of Divine Providence that I must suffer, I am content and resigned.</p>

            <p>In this Light he looked upon the Matter to the last, nor would he be persuaded to see it in any other; and I leave the Reader to determine, whether or not, according to his own Account of the Matter, there is the Appearance of a felonious Intent. Besides, the Method he would have made use of to save himself, when before the Justice, by whom he was committed, favoured much of a bad Principle; for, in order to screen himself, and save his Life, which he thought to be in Danger, he made Information before that Gentleman against eleven Persons, whom he pretended to be concerned with in several Robberies. Two of them were taken up, and Warrants issued out against the others; but, upon the Justice's telling him, that unless his Information was supported by some other Evidence, it would be of no Avail to him: He next contrived to send a Letter toa certain Thief-taker, desiring him to appear before the said Justice, and swear a Robbery against Gibbs and some of the others he had informed against, or he was still in a bad Condition: But, unfortunate for him, his Letter came to the Justice's Hands, and his wicked Scheme to swear away innocent People's Lives, to save his own, was detected; however, the Justice thought he had reason sufficient to commit Gibbs. The two Persons taken upon his Information were set at Liberty, and the Warrants against the others withdrawn; but Gibbs being brought to Trial for the above Offence, was, upon full Evidence found Guilty, and suffered accordingly.</p>

Heseem'd lost to all Sense of having an Account to pass hereafter, shewing much greater Regard to the Preservation of his Body, when dead, than to provide for the Salvation of his Soul, that it might live forever hereafter; for a Gentleman's Curiosity leading him up to the Chapel, (who was a Surgeon) and discovered by some of them that had some Knowledge of him, Ward particularly expressed himself, that he would not come there to be exposed to the View of Surgeons, and was as good as his Word for once, for he never came to Chapel again.</p>

His Friends took Care to supply him with Apparel even superior to his Station, and as he advanced in Years, so the more conceited Opinions of himself he begun to indulge; there were several of his Companions whose Morals were corrupted from their Infancy, who never thought themselves happy, but when they were engaged in Riots and Quarrels, and these were the set of People that first broke in upon the Fences of his good Behaviour, and embroil'd him in the Disputes betwixt the Liberty and Ormond Boys, as they are called in Dublin.

Another Day, as they were strolling after Prey, Dowdle perceiving a Silver Tankard in a Window, ordered Quin to take Care and be in Readiness, the former lifted up the Sash and run away with it, whilst the People of the House pursued him with the Hue and Cry, calling out Stop Thief! Some Gentlemen passing by drew their Swords to stop him, whilst Quin, who was still watching the Motions of his Companion, perceived he was hard set, and regardless of Danger, cleared the Way for his Friend's Escape, who went off with the Tankard, and then sought his own.</p>

Instead of doing as he was bid, he made use of this as an Opportunity fit for his Purpose, and covered the Leather with such Heaps of Snow and congealed Ice, as rendered it useless. The Master, irritated at this, sent for his Father, gave him his Indentures, and sent him away, reviling him much for his Ingratitude to him, who had all along used him very well, and deserved better at his Hands.

In the Morning he was carried before the Lord Mayor, who finding, upon Examination, that he was some dangerous Person, committed him to Newgate, and ordered Enquiry to be made after the Gentleman whose House he intended to rob.

A little after he got his Liberty, he made Love to a young Woman that lately came from Gibraltar and Port-Mahon, who was formerly on the Town, and who had saved an hundred Moidores in her Expedition. This Creature he prevailed on to live with him, and when he got all her Money, and forced her to pawn her Clothes, he thought he must do something to render him famous; it happened about the same Time that one Harpur was committed to the Gatehouse, for picking the Pocket of General Sinclair of a Gold Watch; and Dowdel judging it would redound greatly to his Honour to relieve his Friend in Distress, prevailed on a Number of rash young Men to join him in the Enterprize. Accordingly they went to the Gatehouse, and Dowdel first entering with a Pistol in his Hand, demanded the Body of the said Harpur, swearing, unless he was directly delivered into his Hands, that he would destroy both Keeper and Turnkeys. Upon the whole, he was brought out and rescued in Manner aforesaid, and safely conducted to a Place of Security, until his Escape was found practicable. In the mean Time the Keeper of the Gatehouse complained of the Nature of this Outrage to the Government, as also inserted a Paragraph in the News-Papers, offering a large Reward to any of the Persons concerned in this Rescue that would make a Discovery, with a free Pardon. One O'Brian a Bricklayer took the Bait, and gave in the Names of all the People, which obliged Dowdel, with several others, to seek for Shelter in <placeName id="OA17510617-geo-48">

This Discourse drew the Highwayman's Attention, and looking upon him to be an excessive smart Boy, he desired him to proceed to the Particulars of his Information, promising if he should succeed in any Shape by his Means, to make him a most grateful return; then Talbot told him with whom he lived, and that he frequently went to <placeName id="OA17510617-geo-55">

The next Attempt was made soon after upon an Officer of Distinction in the Guards and his Lady, who were robb'd by his Contrivances; they held on this horrid Course of Life three Years without being detected, till a Scotch young Gentleman, being on a Journey to Bath, was attacked by this Highwayman, who stopp'd the Coach, and ordered the young Gentleman to deliver his Money, otherwise he swore he would put him to Death. These Menaces had no great Effect upon the Gentleman, who happened to be a Person of great Intrepidity and Resolution; but he opposed himself to the Robber, overcame him, and took him, and had him brought to his deserved Fate.

In a short Time he squandered away his ill-got Store, and had Recourse to House-breaking, Thieving, and every other Act of Wickedness his Mind could suggest.

This abandoned Prostitute subverted all Hopes of Amendment in him, and it was by her wicked Allurements that he was tempted the second Time to turn Thief and House breaker.

The Robbery for which he was condemned he confessed to be guilty of, but often said, he thought it hard that he was not admitted an Evidence, as he was the first taken; but well it was that so dangerous a Person was not suffered to escape; he had been bad enough already, and if Opportunity had been granted, he had a Will to be much worse; but God thought fit to suffer him to be cut off, that he might not run into blacker and more Scenes of Villainy, having already sufficiently offended, and broken through all the Fences and Rules of Law divine and human. He owned he deserved to die, but was unwilling to give up Hopes of Life, even to the last Day. He had the most surly morose Behaviour I almost ever met with, and when he was put in Mind of the Heinousness of those Offences he had been guilty of, he replied, he knew best what he had done, and should endeavour to make his Peace with God, as well as he was able, and should continue to do so as long as he lived. How much in Earnest he was in this Case, he is the best Judge who knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts; but, whether it was owing to a particular Steadiness in his Countenance, or to his Consciousness of having used his utmost Endeavours, we don't pretend to determine, but not the least Alteration appeared in his way of Speech, or in his Countenance, even to the last Moment of his Life.</p>

            , sometime before executed, equally as notorious. When these were cut off, he was recommended to the late Field the Boxer, executed sometime since; and had been present at the perpetrating several base Villanies with them and many others. The chief Use they made of him in Robberies was to keep a Lookout; and in Burglaries, when they had broke a House, to list him in, to fetch out what Goods were to be had. He appeared to be as hardened a Youth as ever was at his tender Years concerned in these wicked Practices. The Robbery for which he was convicted was proved clearly upon him, and he did not deny it; and there was another Indictment against him for a Burglary, upon which he was not tried, which he owned he was concerned in. When upon Trial, he was asked what he had to say for himself; his Answer was, in a surly Mood, I have nothing to say. A Day or two before Execution, he seemed somewhat affected; tho' his tender Years, and Want of Reflection, would scarce admit of such a Sense of his Offences, as was necessary for a Person in his unhappy Situation.</p>
