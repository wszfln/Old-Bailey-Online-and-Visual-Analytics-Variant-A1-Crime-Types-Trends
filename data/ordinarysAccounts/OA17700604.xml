During this conversation Stevens came up, with the blunderbuss cocked in his hand, and said, "dam you, I'll tip you over:" On which Shaw made some attempts, with the knife in his hand, to cut or stab, in which confusion the blunderbuss fired; which he declares he never presented, or knew any thing of, till he found the pan open; and that he was so confused at the time by Shaw's resistance, though he heard the report, he did not know but the shot was fired by one of the other two.</p>
            <p>When he was convicted, and sentence passed on him, he looked round on all the court with an air of great contempt, and puting on his hat, said as he went out; 'Tis well you can do no worse. Being shortly after asked by the Ordinary, how he could, at such a time, behave in so insolent a manner, and at the same time representing to him that contrition, humility, and a broken spirit, was much more becoming his miserable situation; he said, that he was so shocked with his sentence, he did not know what he either said or did; and if any offence was given, it was without design When visited in their cells, or in chapel, they all behaved with humility, seriousness, and in appearance, very great contrition; bewailing much the afflictions of their poor aged parents, who very fondly and tenderly reared them; who very readily received and complied with such instructions as were given by the Ordinary, proper for their unhappy situation.</p>

At her house he readily consented and agreed to become one of a gang or party that resorted there, and who chiefly supplied life by robbing, stealing, trespassing on their neighbours, and other evil practices; and though his harbourer and friend often advised him not to associate with them, as she could and would maintain and support him by her profits and industry in the trade or business of life which she fol</p>

            <p>While under sentence he was constantly visited by a German gentleman of his profession, to whom, as well as to me, he gave great satisfaction, by his very decent and proper behaviour, becoming a man in his unhappy situation and circumstances. He attended chapel very regularly and constantly, and in all his words and actions shewed a very sincere repentance and sorrow for this offence, which he said was the first of like kind he ever committed. He confessed he got into the house at the celler window, which he observed was open, when he was that very evening on a visit to his former fellow servants; and finding the compting house door open, forced the desk, out of which he took the money; he took the spoons and other things out of a closet, which he also found open, and then went out with them through the front door: That the temptation of the devil, and the opportunity which seemed so favourably to present itself to his view, induced him to this act to get money for a lewd woman, with whom he then cohabited, and who was instrumental in bringing him to his shameful end.</p>

This fact, for which he died, he said, he was induced to by one of the party not yet taken, who formerly was an acquaintance of his; the other two, Bailey, and one Hamilton, not taken also, he was not acquainted with till the day before, when they communicated to him the plan laid for robbing Mr. Le Mar, which he said, was formed by Hamilton, and the servant maid, who had been shortly before discharged. That he never hurted any man, and then little imagined that any cruelty would have been used; that Bailey stabed the servant man, and that Hamilton and he otherwise maltreated him, while he, Attaway, held a pistol before the little girl, who sat in the kitchen, to prevent her giving any alarm; and when it was given by the servant man, on his getting loose from the bonds and confinement they put him into, he made his escape over the garden wall, where he dropt the pistol which was found. From self-conviction of the unjustness of his actions, and his unlawful course of life, the death he suffered was always in his thoughts, which on every occasion presented the gallows to his view; yet such was his hardness, in spite of all these warnings, and the haunting terrors of his guilty conscience; such his coolness and deliberation in all his scenes of iniquity, that he never hesitated to communicate them to his wife (who endeavoured always to dissuade him from his evil purposes) nor his apprehensions of what, for them, he should at last suffer. Even the day he went to put the robbery, for which he died, into execution, he told her he was going out to do what he was sure he should be hanged for; and that if he did not return home that night, not to be uneasy, for certainly she would find him in a day or two in <placeName id="OA17700604-geo-25">

The identity of his person was so clearly proved, that he was convicted of the charge laid in the indictment, and on the jury bringing their verdict in guilty, death, he thanked them, and said, he would rather die than live a transport, as no man knew the misery of such a state, but those who felt it; which, to him, he said, was so intolerable, that being disappointed, in several efforts he made, to escape from his slavery and bondage, he attempted to hang himself, which, he said, he was fully determined to do, had he not succeeded in his last escape. Being asked at the bar, before sentence was passed on him, what he had to say for himself, why the court should not pronounce the judgment of the law against him? he repeated nearly the same words as before; and added, he was well contented with fate. While under sentence, he attended chapel regularly, and his behaviour was very decent, expressing a sincere sorrow for his former course of life, which has been mostly employed in thieving, and other bad practices, since he was eleven years old. Though his words and conversation often expressed a great levity of mind, yet the many questions he put to me, most essential to be acquainted with, for the true knowledge of our religion, and relative to his situation, were such, as perhaps never are thought on, by those who have been much more learnedly instructed.</p>

            <p>expressions of repentance; and constantly saying, that he resigned his life with willingness, in hope and full assurance of being for ever happy hereafter; free from the miseries and troubles of this uncertain deceitful world, which he so much seemed to despise, that, till the morning of execution, he never appeared daunted, or affected with any terror of the death he was to suffer; and then, while at sacrament in the chapel, he wept and relented much, saying, he then thought his heart had burst within him.</p>
            <p>At the gallows he addressed himself to the populace nearly in the same words as in court, and prayed to God to protect, bless, and preserve them from the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil, which were his destruction; who desired that his friends and relations would not be troubled or concerned about him, for that he was very happy in leaving this word, and died in peace, good will, and forgiveness with all mankind.</p>
