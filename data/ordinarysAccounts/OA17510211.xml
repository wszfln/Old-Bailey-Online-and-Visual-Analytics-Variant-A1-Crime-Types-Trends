He said, it was a House where all those little petty Thieves resorted and carried their Plunder, which the House took off their Hands, allowing them just what they thought proper for their Pains in fetching, carrying, and running the Risque of their lives. He was concerned in divers Thefts and Robberies, and in two of those with Clements before taken Notice of, 'Twas Pity such a little Wretch should come to a Halter, tho' he richly deserved it, he was much fitter for a Rod, which held over him would have made him tremble. His Want of Sense entitled him to no Fears of Danger at a Distance, nor was the Gallows a Terror to him, till he had it before his Eves.</p>

His Guilt, and Share in the Robbery; for which he suffered, he was very unwilling to acknowledge, that nobody could imagine him concerned, who stood at the Entrance of the Alley. But, on the contrary, this Post he chose for himself, favours rather of an old Offender than Innocence; because tis usual for the Knowing ones to put the young ones upon the most hazardous Post-and to place themselves where they may the more conveniently get off the Ground, provided any Surprize should happen. This was the Case, and no sooner had they done the Work, but he was at their Heels, and when the Watch was disposed of, ready to receive his Share of the Prize. Applegarth was taken the same Night that Soss was, and upon his Information to the Thief-takers. Soss and Applegarth had lived in one House for some Time, and were both Thieves themselves, and Receivers of stolen Goods, were accounted insolent and abusive Fellows, when they had got the Person, but mere Poltroons in their own Nature, and scarce able to face a Man.</p>
            <p>He acknowledged he went out with Soss and Brown, with an intent to rob, and that he stood at the Entrance of the Alley, where the Gentleman was robb'd. And whether he suffered justly or no, I leave to any one to determine.</p>

Soss owned himself to be guilty of the Fact, but would not say that Applegarth was concerned. His Mind, he says, misgave him much, when he saw the Gentleman, and discovered his Person; but the Hopes of Money, and the Threats of Brown, pushed him on to what he did, tho' it was with Reluctance. When Soss was taken up, he owned the Fact, and would have been an Evidence, which he said was promised him if he would tell them where Applegarth might be met with; and upon his Direction they went and found him on the other Side of the Water.</p>

He left Work, which he was used generally to follow closely, and went to drinking that infernal Stuff Gin, which, 'tis well known, is what is too much used, and does a deal of Mischief in this Country, unknown to any other. Meeting with two or three loose, disorderly People, in this Fit of Rage, he says, he drank all the Afternoon, and by the Time he committed the Robbery, was very drunk.</p>
            <p>He owns the Fact, with all the Aggravations of using the Prosecutor ill, &amp;c. and reflected upon himself for it, saying he was one of the vilest Sinners for having so done, only that it was not his natural Inclination, but the Force of Liquor and Anger that drove him to it.</p>

And moreover, he said, he would not have been concerned in this had it not been at a Time when he had been drunk, and continued so for some Time, and that every one who knew him in the Neighbourhood, respected him, as a civil, harmless Fellow. He behaved always after Conviction very quietly, and resigned, and shewed as much Appearance of Contrition as any of his Fellow-sufferers; and tho' he was illiterate, would ask several pertinent Questions, with Regard to Salvation and a future State.</p>

            <p>Being now tired of rambling, and near 23 Years of Age, he began to think it Time to settle, and accordingly paid his Addresses to a young Gentlewoman of Family and Fortune, to whom he was married on the 11th of February, 1740; which, according to</p>

            <p>Soon after he was married, he enter'd into the Army, and had the Honour of his Majesty's Commission as <rs id="OA17510211-occupation-29" type="occupation">Ensign in the Regiment of Foot</rs>

He continued in the Army in that Station for above three Years, and he says, that his Behaviour was such, as that in March, 1744, he was promoted to the Rank of a <rs id="OA17510211-occupation-30" type="occupation">Lieutenant</rs>

He might have lived very well, had it not been for that Itch of Gaming, which generally left him Pennyless; tho' sometimes he got Money, he could not be content and make good Use of it, but still continued to play till he could get no more Money.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be improper to take some Notice of that abominable, tho' fashionable Vice, of high Gaming; to which too many of our Nobility and Gentry are so excessively and scandalously addicted, to the utter Ruin of many of both Sexes, both as to this World, and, it is to be feared, the next World too. This was the fatal Spring from whence the unhappy Mr. Parsons drew all his Misfortunes; this was the grand Source of all his Crimes, and the first Cause of his miserable and untimely End. What a shocking Thought is it, that a young Gentleman of his Birth, Education, and personal Accomplishments, should be thus unhappily, tho' most deservedly, cut off in the Flower of his Days? He who might have been an Honour to his Family, and the Delight of all his Acquaintance! And all thro' his unfortunate Inclination for Gaming; a Vice which has perhaps brought more young Men of gay Dispositions, and slender Fortunes, to the Gallows, than any other of those fashionable Methods, which idle and thoughtless People take to kill Time, that can be mention'd. This polite Diversion, or rather this wicked and foolish Practice of gaming High, so as to hurt ones own, or another Man's Fortune, embarrasses ones Circumstances, or destroy ones Peace of Mind; this is a Vice of such a peculiar Nature, that it seems to deprave and corrupt the Heart more than any other. It is a Kind of declaring War against all Mankind: The Gamester looks upon every Man that plays with him, as his Enemy, over whom he makes it his Business to take every Advantage; and if he ruins him, and leaves him without a Shilling in the World, this is look'd upon as nothing. The Gamester has no Bowels of Compassion; his Heart feels no Tenderness for any Man; Friends or Foes are all alike to him; he builds his Success upon their Misfortunes; his Avarice or Extravagancies must be supplied; and to these every Thing, every tender or friendly Connexion, every social Tie, every virtuous and honourable Sentiment, must be sacrificed. - Of the Truth of this Observation, the Life of Mr. Parsons has been but one continued Evidence. As no Man was ever more fitly qualified by Nature to impose upon, deceive, and abuse Mankind, than he was; so perhaps, among the numerous Tribe of gaming Miscreants that he has left behind him (till their Hour too shall come) none ever shewed more Instances of a Heart steel'd and harden'd against the Checks of Conscience and common Humanity than this young Man. For what but the blackest Ingratitude could be capable of using poor Mr. St. J - in the base Manner that he did? His Behaviour towards this Gentleman deserves particular Notice here, among many other Instances which might be mentioned, if Room could be afforded in this Paper. The Story of Mr. St. J - then in few Words, is this:</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175102110012"/>
            <p>During the late Rebellion, Parsons, who was a <rs id="OA17510211-occupation-31" type="occupation">Lieutenant</rs>
               <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                     targets="OA17510211n57-1 n57-3 n16-3 OA17510211-occupation-31"/> in one of his Majesty's Regiments of Foot, having involved himself, by his Extravagancies, in great Streights, and his usual Resource, the Gaming-table, failing him, he applied himself to Mr. St.J -, a half-pay Officer: After acquainting this Gentleman with the bad State of his Circumstances, he added, that he knew no other Remedy than to go down into the Country, and join himself with the Rebels. His Friend, like an honest and prudent Man, advised him by all Means not to embark in such a desperate Scheme; and in short, kindly and generously lent him forty Guineas (as our Information says) as a present Supply. - Soon after this, he went again to this same Gentleman, and acquainted him that some urgent Business, which he particularly mention'd (but whether real or pretended is uncertain) absolutely required his going down into the Country. Whereupon this good-natur'd Friend freely profer'd him the Use of his Horse, to save Parsons the Expence of hiring one. Accordingly, this ungrateful Wretch received the Horse, and directly went to <placeName id="OA17510211-geo-85">

                        targets="OA17510211n57-1 n57-3 n16-3 OA17510211-geo-85"/>Smithfield</placeName> and sold him.</p>
            <p>Having committed this base and ungenerous Action, how could he ever think of again looking his Friend in the Face? Not that he wanted Assurance enough, but it was not safe - He could not expect that this Usage would be tamely put up with; how then to avoid the Consequences was the Question, which this most ungrateful Man at last determined thus. To be beforehand with the just Resentment of Mr. S. J -, and to put it out of that Gentleman's Power to call him to any Account, he had Recourse to the meanest, as well as the wickedest Expedient, that any Man, except a Gamester, or Sharper (which certainly is the lowest and vilest Class of Thieves in the World, let their Appearance or Rank be what it will) could have thought of. In short, he gave in a false Information against his Friend and Benefactor, accusing him of a Design of going to join the Rebels; upon which poor Mr. St. J - was taken into Custody, and was a Prisoner for many Months; nor did he at last regain his Liberty without the Loss of his Half pay, which, on this Occasion, was taken from him.</p>
            <p>Parsons himself too was taken into Custody about this Time, but on what Account we have not been able to procure an exact Information, tho' 'tis generally believ'd, it was a Contrivance of his to screen himself from Arrest by his Creditors.</p>

                  </placeName>, in St. Martin's-Lane</placeName>, where he was treated with great Indulgence, and liv'd in perfect Ease and Security from his Creditors, one of whom, Mr. L - h, a noted Taylor, he took in, as the Phrase is, in the following extraordinary Manner.</p>
            <p>Sometime before his Confinement at the Messenger's, Mr. Parsons being in Company with a certain Officer, who had on a new Suit of Cloaths, made in an elegant Taste; Parsons, who understood Dress as well any Man, and was usually himself as well dress'd as any Person of his own, or greater Rank, took Occasion to ask the Officer who his Taylor was? observing that his Cloaths were so exceeding well made, that he should like to employ the same Person himself. The Officer hereupon told him that L - h was the Person who made those Cloaths; adding, that he was a very honest Man, and would use him well.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Parsons takes the first Opportunity to go to Mr. L - h, telling him he was recommended to him by such a Gentleman (naming the Officer, whose Cloaths he had so much admired.) He added, that his Name was Brown, that he was at present an Officer in such a Regiment, but that a Commission was then, at that very Time, making out for him, by which he was to be made a Captain in the Guards; that he should, on Occasion of this Promotion, want some new Cloaths, and that Mr. L - h must use him well, as he was one that always paid ready Money.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175102110013"/>
            <p>A Customer with these Professions could not fail of being welcome to any Tradesman, and accordingly Mr. L - h made up, for this pretended Captain Brown, Cloaths to a very considerable Value; and when he sent themHome according to the Directions given him, and came himself with a Bill; the pretended Captain had an Excuse ready for not paying him the Money immediately, and so put him off for the present. Mr. L - h, however, now began to entertain some Suspicion of his Customer; and therefore went to the Office to enquire about this Mr. Brown, and whether there was any Truth in the Story of the Commission. Accordingly he found that there really was such a Person as Mr. Brown, (whose Name Parsons knew, and made use of) and that he actually had, or was certainly to have, a Captain's Commission in the Guards; this satisfied Mr. L - h for the present, as he made no Manner of doubt but that Parsons was the Man, the very Mr. Brown whom he was enquiring after. But it was not long e'er, upon further Application for his Money, Mr. L - h was undeceived, and it is no Wonder that he was most highly provoked at such a Fraud; accordingly he determined to take what Satisfaction the Law would afford in such a Case, but unluckily Mr. L - h, laying his Action in the Name of Brown, he was non-suited, and Parsons, getting into the Messenger's House, now set him at Defiance.</p>
            <p>It is no Wonder that a Man capable of a Cheat of this Nature, should also be capable of the Forgery, for which he was tried and condemned at <placeName id="OA17510211-geo-89">

But the Injury he did to Mr. L - h, is attended with less aggravating Circumstances than the Fraud he put upon a Widow, whose Business was that of a Hatter. Some Time before he lost his Lieutenant's Commission, he applied to this Woman, pretending that he had Orders to buy Hats for his Regiment, then in Flanders, and that if she would use him well, he would give her the Preference, and lay out the Money with her. Accordingly he contracted with her for Hats, to the Amount of about seventy Pounds; but instead of paying her for them, he went to another Person in the same Trade, to whom he pretended that he had bought such a Quantity of Hats, of such a Sort, but that he found they would not do for the Regiment, and that therefore he was willing to sell them again to some Loss, rather than let them lie upon his Hands; and in short, though he did not meet with Success at first, in his Attempts to dispose of these Hats, he at last found a Person who bought them of him for fifty Pounds; but we do not find that the poor Widow ever got a Farthing from him.</p>
            <p>The scandalous Manner in which Mr. Parsons used Mr. D - n, a Gentleman of considerable Fortune in Ireland, and another Gentleman of the same Name and Family, (by Profession a Surgeon) by causing them both to be taken into Custody, by Warrants from the Secretary of State, upon his own false Information, is too notorious to need any further Mention.</p>
            <p>An Artifice of his, which is a very true Story, was when the Disturbance was in the North, in the Year 1745, he counterfeited a Draught on one of the Collectors of Excise for 500 l. as from his R - H -. The Collector was surprized at so large a Demand, not having near so large a Sum in his Custody. However, he got 50 l. from the Gentleman, with which Parsons marched off the Ground. Diverse other Tricks has he put upon People, which would take up too much Room to be inserted in this Paper. The above are sufficient to shew what Sort of a Man he was, and what an ungrateful Return he has made for all the Advantages of Family, Education, and Fortune.</p>

In August last was a Twelvemonth he went on Board a Ship, in order for Transportation, and after a tedious Passage, and long Time, he arrived in a Country, which not being suited to theGaiety of his Temper, where there is no Gaming, Balls, Masquerades, &amp;c. he could not think of staying in the Country long, though every Thing was so ordered by Sir William, and his Friends, that he might have lived handsomely enough, and more so than he deserved.

And the last Time he stopp'd to let them come up with him, a Person on Horseback appeared in the Road, which might prevent perhaps, his Attempts, if he had any Design, as his Behaviour gave Room to suspect he had.</p>
            <p>When they had drove up into the Middle of the Town, and saw Parsons, Mr. Best first jump'd down from the Chaise, as did Mr. Fuller soon after, both insisting upon his surrendering immediately, or they would raise the Town upon him. Upon which Parsons alighted from his Horse, and in a submissive, supplicating Manner, begg'd Mercy, and to speak with them in Private. They then took him into a Room, and he delivered up his Pistol, loaded and primed, to each one, in a very complaisant Manner. Mr. Day, the Master of the Rose and Crown, at Hounslow, observ'd that Parsons in every Respect answered the Description of a Person that robb'd on that Road, at that Time, almost every Night. Upon which the Gentlemen agreed, 'twas not proper to let him go for the Sake of the Publick, and sent for a Constable, who came, and upon searching his Pockets, found a Horn of Gunpowder and some Balls: Nor can the most prejudiced in his Favour do otherwise but commend the Resolution that prevented such a Man from being at Liberty, left more Mischiefs should be done by him.</p>

            <p>He was accordingly carried before a Justice of Peace, where after being baulk'd in the Attempt he made to snatch the Pistols out of the Person's Hand, who had the Care of them before the Justice, he begg'd very hard for Mercy, and pleaded his Family, &amp;c. as he did in all Cases of Danger; but the Justice thought proper to commit him to <placeName id="OA17510211-geo-98">

The Gentlemen that took him, out of Regard to the Family, did not chuse to be hasty in the Prosecution of him; but as publick Justice requir'd it, they have now done it to the general Satisfaction of the World. Had he lived ever so long, he had been the same Man, always deceiving himself with Thoughts of deceiving the whole World.</p>
            <p>Parsons acknowledg'd that he has been guilty of many thousand Extravagances; tho' like frail, weak Man, he is not willing to take the Blame entirely to himself, but would shift off Part of the Weight of his Crimes, by endeavouring to lay some of the Blame on others. And therefore says, in a Paper he himself wrote,</p>
            <p>"That he pleads</p>
            <p>"it not as an Excuse, but what is</p>
            <p>"absolutely Fact, that Necessity and the Neglect</p>
            <p>"of his Relations (tho' to be sure, he</p>
            <p>"says, he has deserved their Frowns) obliged</p>
            <p>"him to commit almost every ill Act</p>
            <p>"of his Life, contrary to his natural Inclinations;</p>
            <p>"for I ever had, says he, the utmost</p>
            <p>"Remorse and Shock on me when doing</p>
            <p>"Ill: But starve I could not, to beg I</p>
            <p>"was ashamed. He goes on in the same</p>
            <p>"Paper to say, that his Sentiments were, and</p>
            <p>"are to this Moment, just and honourable;</p>
            <p>"but Gaming has been chiefly his fatal</p>
            <p>"Ruin." Now how far the Publick will rely on this Declaration in Regard to his Sentiments, I must leave entirely to them to judge.</p>
            <p>N. B. If a certain independent Teacher, or any one else intends to print a Life of Parsons write by himself, take Care left he has imposed upon your Credulity, as he has done to all that had any Thing to do with him.</p>

            <p>Several Warrants were Abroad for apprehending Field a long while before he was taken, but the Officers were afraid of him, and it they met him in the Street, they pass'd by him without Notice; and at last, perhaps, he would not have been taken, but being surprized, and off his Guard, was overpowered by Numbers, his old Acquaintance and Friends being Abroad.</p>
            <p>Upon his Trial he used base Means, by suborning others as bad as himself, to swear to the Truth of what himself must know to be false, After Conviction he behaved very quietly to the last, nor gave any fresh Offence to any Body; what he had done, he said, was enough for him to answer for, but nothing wou'd he particularize further.</p>

            The Celebrated Dr. BOERHAAVE's ANTI-SCORBUTICK PILLS.</p>
            <p>For curing the most violent scorbutick Disorder, by an easy gentle Operation by Stool and Urine, which are so innocent and safe, that they may be taken at any Age, requiring no Confinement or Restraint in the Manner of living.</p>
            <p>They are faithfully prepared from a Prescription which the Doctor, after several Days Consideration, gave the Maker of them, as a most effectual Remedy for an old inveterate Scurvy, which had appeared in many Ways. Their good Effects have since been experienc'd in many other Instances.</p>
            <p>The Doctor recommended them in the following Cases, which he said were only different Effects of a violent scorbutick Habit, that had ceased appearing in the Skin, viz. in extreme Lowness of Spirits, so as to occasion an Inactivity of the whole Body; Heaviness in the Head, accompanied with Pain; frequent Dryness and unfavoury Taste in the Mouth; Oppression of the Breast and Stomach, attended with Want of Appetite; a Loathing of Food, Indigestion, and flying Pains like Stitches, with an outward Coldness of the Breast and Stomach; swelling of the Knees, Legs, and Feet, accompanied with Pain and Inflammation; an uneasy Fulness of the Body, Costiveness, and Wind: In these Cases the Doctor particularly ordered these Pills as the best Remedy. They are also good in hysterical Disorders and very effectual in clearing the Head from a confused Stupor and Gloominess; are excellent for Disorders incident to young Women, but not proper for Women with Child; but may be used with great Safety and Success in all Cases which appear to be scorbutick, or really proceed from the Scurvy.</p>
            <p>These Pills are sold in London only, at mr. <persName id="OA17510211n174-1">
