            <p>Now whereas several Malefactors Condemned to Dye, do in the Prison of Newgate, desire the Ordinary to Publish their Conferrences with him, therby giving an Account of their Penitency; and to Warn others by their Examle of suffering Justice, to avoid the same Crimes.

            <p>This account therefore he now give, that on the next Day after Condemnation (they all appeared together in the Chappel) where they were Exhorted and Prayed with; the like was done on Saturday.</p>

            <p>WHereas, the All-searching Eye of God with whom Darkness is Light, and by whom the most Hidden and Secret Things are made Manifest, has made a just Discovery of my Transcendent Wickedness; I think it equally my Duty to God and Man, to second it with a Penitent Confession, that so the dear Interest which the Meritorious Death and Passion of Christ hath purchased for Sins of frail Man-kind may be applicable to my self: For such is the Misery and weight of Sin I lie under, that unless the Miraculous Grace and Mercy of my Creator interpose, is sufficient to press me down to the neathermost Hell. Upon this Consideration, I esteem it my Duty to Publish to the World the occasion which had the influence on my Punishment, or what is the Meritorious cause of my Fatal and untimely End. The occasion was so slender, that it rather aggravates my cruel Crime, than mittigates it. My Wife for whose Murder I duly suffer was of that Temper, that she was indefatigably officious to hunt me from Place to Place; but whether out of Love or Necessity she did it, is a difficulty to Discern, and therefore I proclaim her Innocent; and dare impute nothing to my Excuse, my Passion being above my Principle; and that Grace of God which should lead Men to a true and sincere Repentance, for want of a true management of it, was taken away from me, and I left;, like the Jews, in my own Willfulness and Stubbornness, to act whatever my Spiritual Enemy the Devil could impose upon my Inclination: and indeed the influence, of may Wickedness is such, that if I had the Greatest affluence of Sublunary Enjoyments, it inbitters the most hopeful passages of my Life; and nothing can be Sweet and Cordial to me but the precious Blood of Christ, which was shed for the Sins of the Penitent; such likewise is the present Punishment of the Murder; that through the sense of it, I am Involved into a Deluge of Melancholy, sometimes preventing my address to God for assurance of Pardon: yet according to that Gracious Light which it pleaseth God to intrust me with, I continually lie under the contest of Sin and Satan, and heartily beg for that Supernal Regeneration, which is a turning from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan, to the Kingdom of God, Now, because the world is more Govern'd by Example than Precept, I am highly and zealously concerned, to propose the reflection of my Condition to all those who are miserably biased to. a Dissolute and un-Christian Life; that from my doleful End, they may be cautioned to discard all such Ways as may be Effectual to draw them on to Perdition, and living: without God in the World.</p>
            <p>Nor can I forbear to express my Inclination which was always equal to the Natural, State of all Men: yet such was my Misfortune, that I added the Whip and Spur to make it Strong and Vigorous, and was as inquisitive to know Lewd Company as ready to Imbrace whatsoever was adapted to Irregularity, the Sin of breaking the Sabbath I cannot pass by, and was continually Guilty of: upon which Holy Day I committed the Heinous Sin of Murder; while Pride, Lust and Luxury, had the sole Dominion over me, and was frequently more acceptable than any thing of Piety and Godliness: Thus my Soul being surfeited with all manner of Sin, I am brought to condign Punishment: Take timely care therefore</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA168407100003"/>
            <p>all Young-Men, how you are drawn in by the Bewitching Lust and Love of Women: for tho my Relations were Responsable, and gave me a Good and Pious Education, yet the Grace of God which is infinitly eligible before the whole World, was wanting in me, and justly left me to the Guilt of Murder. Let no Man therefore trust in uncertain Riches, nor bolster himself up with the sufficiency of his Friends, in order to any hopes of Security from suffering the just Punishment of an evil Life; for there is a just God that made and Governs the World, who will not only in this World, but in that which is to come, Shower down Hail, Fire, and Brimstone on those who tread under Foot the Son of God, and put him to open Shame. If this Confession and Advice have efficacy to reclaim any, it only gains the end for which I design&#8217;d it, and to God above be Glory. Amen.</p>
            <p>Two Prayers which <persName id="OA16840710n12-1">

                  <interp inst="OA16840710n12-1" type="given" value="EDWARD"/>Edward Kirk</persName>, desired might be Printed with his Advice to Youth.</p>
            <p>O Lord God, Good and Gracious, Everlasting and Blessed God; I must confess I have been a great Sinner, and without thy Pardon am utterly Undon for Ever: and therefore I pray thee Lord, that thou wouldest be pleased to wash away all my Sins from my Heart, and give me a new Spirit within, so that I may truly serve thee in Holiness and Righteousness, those few Minutes that I have to live in this World: that when my Soul and Body parts, my Soul may ascend up into Heaven, to God on High: so that he that shed his Precious Blood for Sinners (if it be his Blessed Will) may make my Peace with God. Of all my Sins that I have Committed, there is none so sad and Horrible as the Sin of Murder is: therefore I Beseech thee O Lord, to blot out that loud crying Sin from before thy Presence, so that it may not rise up in Judgment against me, when I come before thy TribunalSeat on High.</p>
            <p>Oh! that men would consider this in time, that Sin will one Day change their Countenance; however it cometh in a flattering form, pretending nothing but Friendship but in the end, will leave a Sting behind it, even a guilty Conscience, Terror of Mind, and anguish of Spirit; wherefore let us flye from Sin, as from the biting of a Serpent, that we be not stung to Death; knowing that the ways of Sin, is Death.</p>
            <p>O Lord most Holy, Good and Gracious, Everlasting and Blessed Lord God, how Glorious art thou Lord thou art a great and a Merciful God; and thou hast done more for me a thousand times than I have deserved; I confess I have been a great Sinner;</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA168407100004"/>
            <p>I havedone those things which I should not have done, and I have left undone those things which I should have done. Lord help me, and strengthen my Faith every Minute more and more those few Minutes that I have to live in this World, that when I am departed hence, through the merits of Jesus Christ I may ascend into a Heavenly Kingdom, Amen.</p>

That when she was there, he Quarreled with her, and Bruised her Face and Head with a Cane; that she begged him to spare her, but he drew out a Knife to cut her Throat: which he attempting to do, she Strugled with him, using these Words, Lord have Mercy on my Soul, Was ever Woman so barbarously Murdered? After he had cut her Threat, and returned home, he endeavoured as much as he could to compose his Countenance and go about his Business, and so order his Behaviour, that nothing more than ordinary might appear in his Looks, to give suspition that he had been about any un-Lawful, much less so Horrid a Fact. He told the Ordinary that he would at his Tryal Plead Guilty, and beg, God and the Kings Mercy; yet against his Resolution he denied the Fact, till it was proved upon him, by his own Confession before his Tryal. Notwithstanding he used many false Stories to evade the Proof of the Fact, as appears in the account of his Tryal. Since his Condemnation to Death he hath plainly Bewailed his great prevarication and false asseverationtos the Court of Judicature; hoping that by Repentance and through a true lively Faith, in the Meritorious satisfaction of Christs Blood-shed; His Horrid Murder, and the denial of it so Impudently in the Court of Justice, will be pardoned by God, to him.
