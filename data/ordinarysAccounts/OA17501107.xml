            <p>Those that knew him formerly, say he was always an obstinate self-willed Person; and that he was a half-witted, perverse Fellow, and so has he continued to the Day of his Death: Nor would all the Arguments made Use of by his Friends persuade him to think he had done any thing to deserve his Fate, notwithstanding there were near twenty Indictments for Facts of the same Nature ready to be preferred against him, should he have escaped from those two which were so justly found; from one of which he escaped by Means of a blundering Evidence, and of the other was convicted. The particular Circumstances of which are as follow:</p>
            <p>About a Fortnight before the Robbery was committed upon Mr. Truby's Wife, Robins came to Truby, and told him, he would lay out some Money with him in Handkerchiefs, but that at that Time he had no Money.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175011070005"/>
            <p>About the Time he promised, he did call at Truby's, whose Wife was then in the Shop, and asked her to shew some Goods. She immediately rung a Bell for her Husband, who came down. Then Robins looked out a Parcel, to the Amount of above 7 l. and the Price was fixed upon the Goods. Says Robins, you must carry them to the King's-Arms, where my Horse has stood this Fortnight; my Wife is there, who is a better Judge of Goods than myself; if she approves of them, I will pay you for them. Sir, says Truby, I'm very dirty, but will shift me in five or six Minutes, and then I'll go with you. No, replied Robins, I can't stay; for myTime is overpast, and should have been at another Place before now; let your Wife go; upon which Truby sent his Wife with the Goods, but no Bill of Parcels, only a Note cast up what the Goods came to. Truby's Wife and Robins went into the <placeName id="OA17501107-geo-11">

Robins called for a Quartern of Rum, and before it came, snatched the Goods from under her Elbow, and ran away. This was done August 13. And on the 3d of September, he put the Cheat upon Delawar in this Manner, as Freemount the Foreman told the Story. Friday the 31st of August, Robins came to Rottenbury a Journeyman to Mr. Delamar, with a Letter forged in the Name of one Hampton, a Shop-keeper in Bristol, who knew the said Rottenbury, desiring him to recommend the Bearer to a Person who could use him well for Silks of a particular Sort. Rottenbury carried Robins to Mr. Dolamar's Warehouse-man; but the Warehouse being shut up, Robins was told to call on Monday, and he might see the Goods: Accordingly on Monday Afternoon Robins came, and looked out the Goods, and taking Occasion again to get the forged Letter, he put it into his Pocket. The Goods were, according to Robin's Direction, to go to the Three Cups in Bread-street, for a Gentlewoman to see, who, if she liked them, was to pay down ready Money to Robins, and he to pay Freemount. Robins and Freemount went to the <placeName id="OA17501107-geo-12">

Freemount pursued him without his Hat for Haste, thinking Robins could not be above ten Yards before him; however the latter made such Haste, that the former could not overtake him, but lost Sight of him intirely.</p>

            <p>Such are the Arts that wicked Man made use of to cheat the Unwary; and for a long Time, he, together with one Br - ng, has carried on these vile and atrocious Practices: And, though he would not own any, yet various are the Villanies of this Kind committed by these and others of their wicked and tricking Crew. Robins always took Care to have somewhat of a Note of the Value of the Goods he thus surrepticiously and fraudulently got into his Custody. And, as he stood at the Bar upon his Trial, had a large Parcel of them in his Hat, thinking, by producing these, to evade the Law, and take off the Appearance of Theft and Robbery from every Accusation that might be brought against him. But Justice was too mighty for his little tricking Cunning. Every one that knows any thing of Trade, must see through this Cheat, and judge, that this is not the regular Method of parting with Goods intirely, and alienating the Property; and Robins's Notion of these Things was deceiving himself, and his villainous Accomplices. He seemed to the last the most insensible Wretch that ever was in this Condition; nor could the Terrors of the Lord, or the Persuasionof his Friends avail any thing towards making him Sensible of his detestable ill-spent Life. As witness, that kind, tender, and awakening Letter sent him by a Friend, who saw him once or twice after, and all to no Manner of Purpose.</p>
            <p>The Letter is as follows, viz.</p>
            <p>Shoreditch, Oct. 27. 1750.</p>
            <p>Mr. Robins,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175011070007"/>
            <p>SINCE I was with you, I have seen Mr. Delemare, Mr. Truby, and Mr. Horton the Baker, Truby's Landlord, who have convinced me that what you told me of their making out Bills of Parcels of the Goods you had, is an abominable Falsity, I must be so plain as to tell you, such Disingenuity, and prevaricating, is highly unbecoming a dying Man; pray George, lay your Hand upon your Breast, and can you dare to say, Mr. Delemar's Foreman ever deliver'd you a Bill of Parcels of the Goods, or even that there was any Writing at all, except a little Scrip of Paper, with the Number of Yards and Price, cast up for the Man's use that he might not mistake in taking the Money, had you been so just as to pay for them. And you know you would have been cast on Mr. Delemar's Indictment, had not his Man blundered in his Evidence. Truby denies he ever offered to take three Guineas, or any Money in lieu of his Loss. The Landlord says, that when he saw you in <placeName id="OA17501107-geo-13">

And the poor Man from making a few Goods for himself, now works as a Journeyman. Can you appeal to God, who searches the Heart, that when you applied to Delemar, with Browning's forg'd recommendatory Letter, you had no Intention to defraud him of the Goods, but to pay honestly for them? Why did you run away out of the Tap-House, with the Goods, and leave the poor Servant in the Lurch? Was it any Proof of your honest Intent to pay, that you sold (as I am credibly inform'd) part of the Silks, which were prized by Mr. Delemar at 12 s. 6 d. per Yard, for no more than six Shillings? Why did you, to impose on Truby, tell him the Goods must go to the King's-Arms for your Wife to see, and said the Horse stood there, (which was a Lie) and pretend such a Hurry that you could not stay while Truby shifted himself, who therefore sent his Wife with the Goods? Did you not call for a Quartern of Rum at the King's-Arms, and before it came, snatch the Goods off the Dresser from Mr. Truby, who had her Elbow leaning on them, and made off. Now weigh all these Circumstances, and do you, or any Man, of common Sense judge, if in both these Cases, there was not a plain Intent to rob, and defraud. You see I have made as exact an Enquiry as I cou'd, since as your solemn Declarations of Innocence, as a dying Man, somewhatstaggered me, tho' I could not even then believe them true, and should have opened my Mind more to you, had I been with you alone. Perhaps you may feed yourself with Hopes of a Reprieve, but if you had seen a Paragraph in yesterday's Gazetteer, particularly levell'd at you by Name, it would damp all such Hopes. I desire you will not interpret what I wrote, as if I intended to reflect on you under your Misfortunes; no, I pity your Person, tho' I derest the Facts you have committed, and I must take the Freedom to say, that palliating and excusing Facts, which can't be defended, is a small Sign of true Penitence; you may deceive Men, and hide your Crimes; but you cannot deceive your Maker. I pray God to change your Heart, and inspire you with true Repentance; and that you may be prepared for what ever his good Providence shall allot for you; that if your Life be spared, you may, by your future Conduct, shew, that you were deserving the Mercy you received; and if you should be ordered for Execution, that Death itself may be an Advantage to you, is the hearty Desire of</p>
            <p>Yours, R. C.</p>
            <p>P. S. I think it highly necessary you make all the Satisfaction you can to the Persons you may have injured, by doing the Best you can to help them to their Goods; and if poor Truby's Goods are pawn'd any where, let him know where, that he may recover them.</p>

            <p>The Paragraph alluded to in the above Letter was as follows.</p>
            <p>We hear for certain, that there are a Set of Gentlemen Sharpers, who now infest this City and Suburbs, genteely dressed, who call themselves Country Tradesmen, and under that Pretence, sometimes assisted with a sham Recommendation, procure unwary Merchants or Tradesmen to send their Journeymen with such Goods as they pretended to want, to some Inn of Repute, in order to be there paid for them in ready Money. As soon as the Goods are arrived at the Inn, the Gentleman Sharper feigns some specious Pretence for taking the Goods up Stairs, with a Promise, however, of bringing down the Money for them, directing the Journeyman in the mean Time to write a Receipt; and by such like Shifts, these new-fashioned Dealers get (what they call) the legal Possession of the Goods, and then they as legally march off with them, leaving the Proprietor to his Right of Action only, in Case he can find his Chapman. - 'Tis most certain, that <persName id="OA17501107n35-1">

            Robins persisted, to the last Evening, in his obstinate way of saying, that if he had paid for the Goods, as he should have done, and had others been true to him, who gave Orders to him, to look out for Goods, and engaged to pay for them, he knew no Wrong, or Injustice in his Way of Dealing; But, on the Morning of Execution, I made use of such Arguments, particularly with respect to the Robbery for which he suffered, that at last he did comply so far as to say, his Punishment was no more than he deserved for it, and many other Offences of the like Kind.</p>

His good Principles, (if any remain'd) were by this Means extinguish'd, and all his Money gone. The next Thought was, how he should supply the Deficiency; Work he was a Stranger to, and it no way suited with his Inclination, and therefore he betook himself to Street Robbing, and Thieving, a Business that could be carried on at Night, and in which, if he prov'd successful, he would not undertake again 'till the Profit of the Spoil was quite exhausted; and as Night affords the most convenient Shade for Works of Darkness, he pursued in this Course, and committed several Street Robberies upon his own Bottom; while at last frequenting the usual Places of Rendezvous for Persons of this Character, he contracted an Acquaintance with one Odel, and Burridge, and so set out to rob in Company, but with this Proviso, that they might make themselves Masters of any Gentleman's Property, bully and swear at him they might, but should promise, not to abuse or hurt his Person -</p>

He was very remarkable, however, among all that had any Knowledge of him in those his early Days, and generally went by the Name of Jeff the Baker. He was an unlucky Youth, and one of the foremost in all boyish mischievous Tricks; and therefore the more</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175011070011"/>
            <p>generally noted among those of his own Time.</p>
            <p>He was no sooner out of his Time, than he began to get acquainted with Gamblers, and other idle and wicked Persons, some of which are well known at this Time, and are in a fair Way to follow him the Road he last went. He now became tired of Toyling in a Bakehouse, and thought being abroad with his new Companions much better than being confined in Doors all Day, sweating to get an honest Livelihood. Gaming, and other of those profligate Vices of theirs, seemed agreeable to him, and he resolved to put in his Lot amongst them, and to be Partaker of their Wickedness; and, being an active and a daring Fellow, was very fit for their Purpose, and met with great Encouragement amongst them. No Man was more ready at any Enterprize, and he generally had the good Luck to get off undiscovered, or at least so as to escape the Hands of Justice. The Fate he at last met with, has been deserved this many Years past, which he could not deny: And, though he was sensible he so richly merited it, he used various Means to endeavour an Escape from it. Besides, what will be hereafter set forth, he had the most uncommon and unheard of Assurance to write a Letter to a Person in a very high Rank, supplicating him to save his Life, without any Manner of Recommendation or Knowledge of him; only, perhaps, he might have heard, with the Rest of the World, that he was a tender, humane and compassionate Man to the Distresses and Afflictions of his fellow Creatures.</p>
            <p>Everett went on in a loose, dissolute and abandoned Way of Life for a long Time e'er the Law had Opportunity to lay hold of him, tho' daily were the Pranks he played that were liable to the Censure of it. At length he and one Wright, having reduced an unwary poor Girl to swear a Street Robbery against two People (on the Indictment for which however they were acquitted) they missed their Aim, and the Trap they had privily laid for others, they sell into themselves: For the Girl in a short Time after, finding them remiss in what they had promised her, disclosed the whole Scene of Iniquity. And Everett and Wright, being indicted for the same, were ordered to be set upon the <placeName id="OA17501107-geo-35">

            <p>A Gentleman, with whom I was in Company the Day of Execution, told me, He went with some others to relieve an unhappy Criminal one Day, while Everett was there; before they went out, one of them missed his Handkerchief, and returning to Everett, told him of it; upon which he pretended to be surprised, and said it was impossible to recover it again: But, asking one that stood by, and another or two about it, he at length fixed upon one whom he called Turpin, who, with a great Oath, denied it; at the same Time going out into another Appartment, Everett followed, and presently brought back the Handkerchief, for which he received some Reward.</p>

He had no other Way of getting a Livelihood, and therefore we can conclude no other from his then past and future Conduct. The first Thing we know of was, in the notorious Way of picking up poor Country-fellows, in order to practise Cheats and Frauds upon them.

They had not been long there, only the drinking of a Glass of Wine, perhaps, when Everett made a Motion for this Woman to take a Walk into the Garden, and desired Mrs. Graves, the Mistress of the House, to bear her Company. The poor Woman not suspecting any Harm, as they passed for Man and Wife, went with her; inwhich Interval of Time, Everett found Means to pick the Lock of a Scrutore, or Bureau, and took out 60 l. and some Gold Rings, which Sum it seems the poor Woman had laid up against the Time the Brewer called upon her. When he had got this Booty, he found Means to fasten the Lock again, and filled it with little Pieces of Sticks, to prevent her Key doing its Office, in case she should have Occasion to go to the same Place before his Departure, or sooner than he wished she should; soon after he took his Leave, and away went he and this Mistress.</p>
            <p>The poor Woman had not Occasion to look at her Money, till about a Fortnight after, when she found the Lock filled with little Sticks, and was obliged to have it forced open.

The poor Woman was inconsolable, if not driven to Distraction; his Villainy brought upon her a Suspicion she did not merit; and he owned this Fact to two Gentlemen, who are ready to give Testimony thereof, if Occasion should be to put them to that Trouble.</p>
            <p>This might have brought him to Justice; but he was always skulking up and down, as Thieves are used to do, and it was a very hard Matter to find him two Days in the same Place: But at length he was overtaken, and the Robbery for which he suffered, and its cruel and barbarous Consequences, which ensued from his Knife of eighteen Inches long, shew how desperate a Fellow he was, and how necessary it was, that he should be taken away from among Men.</p>
            <p>Since his Conviction, he behaved in a seeming composed and devout Manner, till the Warrant for Execution came down on Thursday last, when he began to be disturbed in Mind, and could not help shewing it. On Friday Night an Information was made to Mr. Akerman, of some Matters, which seemed to shew, he had a Design, by the most outrageous, and murderous Means, to attempt an Escape. On Saturday Morning, Search was made in the Cells, and about his Person, but nothing being found, he behaved in a very insolent Manner, and swore were the Person there, who had made the Information, had he a Pistol in his Hand, he would shoot him directly, and he made use of a very extraordinary Speech, to what Purpose he intended it might serve I never could understand, nor any that heard it; and it was this, pointing with his Righthand to one Part of the Press-yard, and with his Left to the opposite, he said,</p>
            <p>"Were Death, where he pointed with</p>
            <p>"his Right-hand, and were my Pardon,</p>

            <p>Sunday, and Monday Morning Evevett behaved very outrageously, and blasphemously, nor could any Advice take hold of him. Tuesday Morning, when he had proved all his Attempts were vain, his Passion subsided, and he said he found it was over with him, and he wou'd endeavour to be easy, and so continued till Evening, when his Wife was admitted to take her leave of him; and at the Interview, both behaved well enough, all Things considered. On Wednesday Morning he seemed pretty well composed, and in all Appearance, to took leave of the World.</p>

Accordingly he walked with him, was always before him, and could have beat him; so that he became as it were a Party concern'd. Flush'd with the Prospect of Victory the last Day Ryley led the Way, and had pushed several People out of the Path before; but unluckily and unthinkingly he says, he happened to strike the Deceased, Sutton, on the Side of the Head, with his Sword, who laid his Foot in the Way: At which Sutton being enraged, flew at him like a Lion, catched him by the Collar, and struck him several Times in the Face, and Riley was tumbled down on the Ground with a Number of People about him. Thinking to get rid of Sutton and the Mob, he says, he thrust at him; and, as it happened, pricked him in the Belly with his Sword, as he stood over him, not with a Design to kill, but to relieve himself from the Press. After which he went to a Publick-House, and drank with some of his Acquaintance, who would have had him to make off; but he replied, he knew not any thing he had done to be afraid of. However, some Time after, came some People, and took him, and being carried before Justice Manly, was committed to the Gate-house. He was sensible of the Guilt of taking away a Man's Life, and repented with bitter weeping for the same; but could not help at the same Time regretting the Loss of his own Life in the Prime of his Age.</p>

            <p>He laboured under great Anxiety upon Account of somewhat he said he would discover to me before he died; and the Day before Execution he told me as follows, viz. That a Comrade of his having a Wife, whom he treated very ill, upon Account of Jealousy heentertained upon Ryley's Account, tho' he said without any just Foundation. However Ryley, as he declared, in Pity to that Woman, entered into an Agreement with his Comrade, that if he would give up all Pretensions to her, as he saw they would never live peaceably together, he would marry her himself. Accordingly 'twas agreed upon, and the Comrade, the Woman, and Ryley, went to the Fleet, the Comrade first threw his Certificate of Marriage in the Fire, and then Ryley and the Woman were married at the same Place, and had a fresh Certificate. Whatever Offence was chargeable upon his Mind upon this and all Accounts, he was very sorry for, and was almost incessantly invoking the Lord Jesus Christ to have Mercy upon him, and receive his Soul.</p>
