            <p>While under Sentence, they were earnestly exhorted to prepare themselves by a true and sincere Repentance, for that Change so near approaching, in order to which they were instructed in the Nature of true Repentance, that it consists in not only a penitential Sorrow for Sins committed in an absolute Resolution and determining to lead a new Life, to loth and abhor themselves for what they had done; but in asking with unfeigned Lips Pardon of God Almighty, to throw themselves before the Throne of Grace, and incessantly by fervent Prayer, to</p>

            <p>implore Forgiveness and Mercy from that God who is just and merciful, whom they had so much offended.</p>
            <p>Three of them, viz. Burnham, Miller, and Grant, having been guilty of the horrid Sin of Murder, I laid before them the heinousness of that Crime, how dishonourable it is to encroach upon the divine Prerogative of God, who is the Sovereign Lord of Life and Death: The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away, says the Psalmist, and blessed be the Name of the Lord. I am the Lord, that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another, neither my Praises to graven Images. Isaiah xlii. 8. To me belongeth Vengeance and Recompense, Deut. xxxii. 35. From these, and such - like Texts of Scripture, I proceed to shew 'em the unjustness of their Crimes, how injurious to our Neighbour it is, to take away that Life 'tis not in our Power ever to restore or to make any amends for.</p>
            <p>I also instructed them from the Holy Scripture in the Nature, End and Design of the Holy Sacrament, The Cup of Blessing, which we bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ, 1 Cor. x. 16, 17. And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers, Acts. ii. 42.</p>

            <p>So far is the Account given by Burnham himself, but how true, or how much to be depended on, is mighty easy to be seen by the strong Evidence against him at his Trial, when it was plainly prov'd, that Burnham with either a Knife or Dagger, struck the Deceased in the Face, and redoubling his Blow, the Black fell to the Ground and never spoke more. The first of the Wounds which was the mortal one, was in the Socket of the Eye, the other of no Signification, was on the Right Shoulder; 'tis true, the Black had in quarrelling with the Women before Burnham struck him, been scratch'd in the Face a little, but not to hurt him. After the Fact was done, Burnham ran away, and was taken hid under the Bench of a Summer-house in a Garden, and being charged with having murder'd the Black Man, he said he had not, and cried out, What have I done? On his making the above Profession of his Innocence, it was natural to ask him, why he flew for it if he knew himself not guilty? his Answer was, because he was afraid of the Press-Gang.</p>
            <p>On his being guilty of such barefaced Equivocation, I set before him in as strong a Light as the Scripture itself could furnish (and surely there can be no stronger!) how foolish, how sinful it was to make a Mock of God, and to deceive his own Soul, till at length he became more calm, wept bitterly, and appeared penitent. He declared he believed in Christ, and was in Peace with all Men, and died in the Romish Communion.</p>

On that Brother and Sister he used strongly to reflect, as the Cause of bringing him to this fatal End, for the Sake as he said of his Goods, tho' it was prov'd he was indebted to his Brother more than twice the Value of them; he endeavour'd to extenuate his Guilt, by saying 'twas Convulsion Fits only that caused his Wife's Death, notwithstanding it being so plainly prov'd he murder'd her; every Circumstance was so strong against him, that I was surprized he should even attempt an Excuse, 1st, The Evidence of the Woman who saw him knock her down with his Fist, then fetch a Club and give her with it such a Blow on the Head as to make the Blood gush out from her Nose, Mouth, Ears and Eyes. 2d, The Declaration of his Wife as a dying Woman, that after he had thus knock'd her down, he stamp'd upon her Breast, in a violent manner. And lastly, The Testimony of the Surgeon, that this Stamping was the Cause of her Death. I say, after all these concurring material Circumstances I blam'd him, and laid before him the Wickedness of his making any Shadow of an Excuse, and advised him to humble himself before Almighty God, to confess freely his Fault if he hoped for any free Forgiveness, all which had no very great Effect on him, for tho' he appeared a little Penitent, yet I fear his Sorrow and Repentance was not equal to the Greatness of his Crime; he behaved generally quiet, but with somewhat of a moroseness in his Temper not easily to be disguised. He said he repented of his Sins, believed in Christ, and died in Peace with all Men.</p>

I say, one Moment's Reflection might perhaps save an Age of Pain. I do not mean in this World only, but in that World (far more to be dreaded by such Wretches) which is to come, an Hereafter that has no Period, an Eternity of Misery, and ten thousand Millions of Ages of Pain. Even admit that Blows should not prove fatal, yet nothing so strongly shews a pusilanimous, mean, cowardly Temper in a Man than his striking a Woman, who is allowed to be the weaker Vessel.

Carpenter had nothing to add to his former Confessions; Burnham owned his being in the Mob or Riot, but not that he gave the fatal Blow to the Black, still laying it on his Companion Fat face, he behaved well and was penitent; Grant owned himself to have been a wicked young Man, that he committed the Murder, and suffered deservedly; Miller would not own the Murder of his Wife plainly, though sworn so positively against him by an Eye-witness.

            <p>PASSION, when it once gains an Ascendant over our Minds, is often more fatal to us, than the most deliberate Course of Vice could be; on every little start, it throws us from the Paths of Reason, and hurries us in one Moment, into Acts more wicked and more dangerous, than we could at any other Time, suffer to enter our Imaginations. As Anger is justly said to be a short Madness, so, while the Frenzy is upon us, Blood is shed as easily as Water, and the Mind is so filled with Fury, that there is no Room left for Compassion.</p>

            <p>Rhodes continued in this Station upwards of a Twelvemonth, and after that took a House for himself in order to follow that Business, and having as was observed before, pretty many Acquaintance, might if he had minded his Business have lived comfortably in this Station; but being of a Disposition not much inclined to Business he could not mind it, for instead of being in his Shop, he was continually at some Diversion or other, such as Horse-Races, Balls, &amp;c. which generally stripp'd him pretty well of his Cash, and put him often at his Wits-end to get more; but pretty much frequenting the Billiard-Tables at that Place, used now and then by that Means to get a Supply.</p>
            <p>During the Time of his House-keeping, he got acquainted with a Tradesman's Daughter of that City, who entertain'd him in the Quality of a Suitor.

            <p>The old People to be sure was very uneasy at their Daughter's Proceedings, and threatned to turn her out of Doors if she would not confess who she had married; at last she told them that her Husband wuld come there in three Days to see her, for he was gone some Miles off, and then they should see who she had married. With these Words the old People was for the present satisfied, whereupon the Girl took an Opportunity that Evening to acquaint Rhodes with what she had done, and how her Father had missed his Money; and likewise that she had not confessed who was her Husband, and at the same Time with abundance of Tears begg'd that he would direct her how to proceed.

            <p>The next Morning her Father arose early, and went out according as she expected, and generally those sort of People in their Dealings get pretty merry over a Cup of Ale in making their Bargains, so did her Father, for he came Home about 5 o'Clock in the Afternoon very much in Liquor and went to Bed, and her Mother going out to pay a Visit to a Neighbour of her Acquaintance, in this Time she found means to convey her Cloaths to Rhodes's Shop, which was about a Quarter of a Mile from her Father's House, and he being at Home ready to receive them; Rhodes took in her Apparel, and she told him what she had done, and likewise concerning the Notes, which put him in a sort of a Hurry that she should miss such an Opportunity; but it was now too late, for her Mother had taken her Father's Keys out of his Pocket, and carried them out along with her, and if she staid another Night, in all Probability the Money would be missed, so there was no Time to be lost.</p>

This he communicated, and she very readily agreed to it, as indeed she would comply to any Thing he proposed; so she step'd Home after she had left her Cloaths to see how Things was, and likewise to get some of the Notes if she could; but in this latter Affair she could do nothing, her Mother having the Keys; but as soon as she returned Home, and her Mother came in, she pretended that she was very ill, and wanted to go to Bed, so took her Leave of her Mother, bidding her good Night; but instead of that, she went up into her Room, and when she had a little settled herself, she came down Stairs softly without her Shoes, and stole out at the back Door, and came immediately to Rhodes's House, who had before taken Care to provide for his Jour-ney as well as he could, for he had borrowed a great Coat of one, and several Things of another, and what Money he could of every Body that would lend him any, and leaving a Man in his Shop, pretending to his Creditors that he was going to receive a Legacy about 40 Miles distant from the City, which would satisfy them all; with these Words they were made easy.</p>

            <p>While he lodged at this House, he contracted an Acquaintance with one of these Gentlemen, and Rhodes bought himself a new Suit of Cloaths, and appeared Alamode de France, in a very gay Manner, and he and his Friend used to frequent all manner of publick Places of Note, as Opera's, Plays, &amp;c. in frequenting these Places, he was under a Necessity to break into his standing Stock, and had nigh well consumed it, before he thought of any Thing towards raising a Recruit; at last he got acquainted one Day at the Billiard-Table (which he used to frequent) with a Frenchman, who was expert at that Game, to this Person Rhodes broke his Mind, telling him what a Sum might be raised by their playing Booty together, which he told him he had practised in <placeName id="OA17420712-geo-108">

            <p>The Frenchman approving of the Thing, they consulted to meet together the next Day privately, in order to agree how the Design should be put into Execution, which they settled in the following manner, viz Rhodes was to go to the Billiard-Table proposed, and to play a certain Time, and then the Frenchman was to come in, and he was to challenge Rhodes to play, and whatever was Won was to be snacked between them; this Design succeeded according to their Wish, for they both being very good Players, the Bystanders was not certain which Way to lay their Money, at last pitched on Rhodes, who you may depend upon 't was sure to loose, and when they changed their Sides, the Frenchman likewise lost; they gained considerable by these Stratagems to the amount of a 100 l. between them in a few Days. At last the Frenchman who thought to out-wit Rhodes, proposed that he should let him have the whole Sum which they had before won, and then to go to the illiard-Table, and when they came there, Rhodes was to fix upon a Person, who all the Company knew play'd worse than himself; this Person Rhodes was to challenge to play for a trifling Sum, and if he could get him to play, then the Frenchman was to lay all he could against Rhodes, who was to loose, this Rhodes agreed to, and the next Day they went, and this Stratagem succeeded according to their Design, for the other Person accepted of Rhodes's Challenge, it being but for a Trifle, and Rhodes losing the first Game, encouraged the other to play on, and while they was a playing, the Company came in a pace, and the Frenchman making of his Betts against Rhodes, most of the Company who had seen</p>

            <p>Rhodes play before betted for him, and by this means the Frenchman who had all the Money, won upwards of 50 l. till he had drained their Pockets pretty well, and when he found he could make no more Betts, he whilst Rhodes was at Play slip'd out of the Room unperceived, and carried all the Money clear off along with him. Rhodes being very intent upon his Game, did not miss him till he was gone out of the Room sometime, and then accidentally turning and missing the Frenchman, he posted away, flinging down his Mace in the middle of his Game, the People wondered at his sudden Departure, as indeed they very well might.</p>
            <p>Rhodes goes away immediately to where the Frenchman used to frequent, but could hear nothing of him; at last he went to his Lodgings, but was not there, and the People told Rhodes that he had got all his Things away; this put Rhodes into a great Consternation, and he went Home with a very heavy Heart, having but one melancholly Guinea left in his Pockets. The next Day Rhodes rambled all over the City, but could hear nothing of the Frenchman, and by this Time his Guinea being pretty nigh gone, he was at a stand what Course next to take; at last, telling some English Gentlemen a very dismal Story how he had been defrauded out of all his Money, by a Person who had made his Escape; and carrying some of them to the Lodgings where this Frenchman lived, and the People confirming what he had inform'd them; the Gentlemen gther'd amongst them upwards of 5 Guineas, (which Rhodes said was to bear his Expences, and carry him over to England) which they gave him.

The Frenchman you needs must think was very much Confounded, at his unexpected Meeting, and could scarce speak at the sight of Rhodes.</p>
            <p>Rhodes who had always a good presence of Mind, did not fly into a Passion at this unexpected sight; but ask'd him how he could be such a Villain to serve him in the manner he did. The Frenchman pretended to be very sorry for what he had done, and told him he would give him half what he had, which he said was about 30 l. the rest he said he had lost at Hazard; and likewise he appeared by seeing Rhodes at that Place, that he was going to England, and he told him that when they came there he had some Friends that he was to receive 300 l. off, and then he would generously Refund all he had taken away with Interest; this Rhodes seem'd to be well satisfied with, and both being agreed, they supp'd together in a very Friendly manner; the Frenchman putting the Glass about, he began to be very Merry.</p>

            <p>Now as soon as this was done, Rhodes call'd the Landlord of the House, and told him that his Friend had over Drank himself and was a sleep, and he desired that he would order him to be put to Bed, for fear he should catch Cold; and likewise told him that he need prepare but one Bed, he intending to lay that Night with him himself.</p>
            <p>This being done, Rhodes did not sit up long afterwards, but was shew'd up to Bed in the same Room; as soon as he entered the Room, he searched the Frenchman's Pockets, and found upwards of 45 l. besides the 15 which he had given him over Night; then taking all his Linnen out of his Portmantua, Rhodes put it into his own, then went to Bed, and was up in the Morning before 5 o'Clock, and came down Stairs, and told the Landlord of the House, that his Friend was so very Ill that he could not get up to go this Passage, but would wait for the next, and he</p>

            <p>desir'd nobody might disturb him; for he had not slept all Night. By the time that Rhodes had Drank something, the Vessel was ready to go off, so Rhodes sent his Portmantua on Board, and taking leave of the Landlord, followed himself.</p>
            <p>Likewise he in the Morning left the Frenchman a Letter of Consolation which he put in his Pocket, was as follows, viz.</p>
            <p>MONSIEUR,</p>
            <p>" YOU will no doubt be surpriz'd when you " Awake, and find your Companion flown.

Some time since, having little hopes of being saved, he mentioned about 16 Persons concern'd with him in forging of Wills, and confess'd that by that Practice, they Receiv'd 500 l. per Month, by which Confession he was in great hopes of gaining a Reprieve, tho' he did not so much rely upon that, as the Thoughts he had a second time of attempting his Escape.</p>
            <p>He invited several of the Persons, under the same unhappy Sentence with him, into the Conspiracy. But none of them took Notice of what he said to them; at that time a Debtor being brought into the Cell's, for some disturbance he had made, amongst his Fellow Prisoner's, had the Liberty of his Wife coming too and fro to him when e'er she pleased; she in going backwards and forwards, was obliged to go by the Door of Rhode's Cell, before she could come to her Husband; Rhodes took the Opportunity one Day, to discover his Design to the Woman, and earnestly insisted on her to get the things for him, and Promis'd her 20 l. two Days after he had got his Liberty, and gave her a Paper to inform her what to get, which she took, and instead of going to buy the things, went to the same Gentleman, with the Paper of her Instructions, and so discovered the whole affair, and Rhodes was a second time secured.</p>

Who by their Intercession, gave some " Degree of Merit to a worthless Wretch, and " thereby put it in my Power to deserve that " Mercy I have receiv'd.</p>
            <p>" But above all how thankful ought I to be " to that Supreme Being, who touch'd the Hearts " of these Gentlemen with Tenderness, for my " unhappy Condition, and inclin'd his Majesty " to give Ear to their Request. How sincerely " do I admire the Ways, by which Providence " has conducted me through that Labyrinth " wherein I was be wilder'd with my Folly, and " saw no Issue, but by a Way on which I wanted Courage to look.</p>

Let me always remember how " much I owe the Royal Hand, that snatch'd me " from the Grave; let me not disgrace those " Recommendations, which my Friends were so " kind to give me, and let me improve the " Remainder of my Life, so that when Death " comes in it's natural Course, I need not desire " another Reprieve.</p>

That I might have them in the Morning, my Wife will tell you how you may get them.</p>
            <p>You may Buy them for a Triffle Second-Hand; lap some Paper round them, as they dont chink against one another. For God sake, let me have 'em to Night, if possible, and we are sure to be out, for e can do it asie; get a half Inch Spike bit, a large Gimblet, a half Inch Goge, a Chissel, a turning Saw, such as they make Key holes with, not too small, and a pair of Pinchers, they will cost but a small Matter Second-Hand, they don't cost but Twenty-pence, or thereabouts New, but New will not do for me, because they have no Handles. Let them be sharp or they will not do for my Purpose; With the Assistance of God, that will save my Life. For God sake, dont fail, and I will go down as far as Cumberland, or thereabouts, and never see London again was I but out. Dear Cousin, don't fail me.</p>
