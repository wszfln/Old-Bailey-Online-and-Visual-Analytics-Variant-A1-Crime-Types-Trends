            <p>destroyed, and she says, they always lived quietly together. She was a sober, pains-taking Woman, and was as well respected among the Neighbours, as a Woman in her Station of Life could be expected to be, till this horrid Affair happened.</p>
            <p>She says, that about six Weeks before this Violence was done to the Life of this poor unhappy Infant, she had laboured under a violent Fever, which raged upon her for about three Weeks, or more, which Nature, by God's Permission, got the better of, very little assisted by Art or Physick. The Dregs of this Disorder, 'tis reasonable therefore to believe had left a Sort of Delirium, or Melancholy upon her. And she constantly affirmed, that from that Time she was always in a Hurry, and Confusion of Spirits, and could have no rest Day nor Night. She seldom shut her Eyes to sleep, or if she did, was disturbed and attended with Starts and Fears. She was continually running up and down Stairs, and could never set down long to Business, her Spirits being continually agitated and flurried, but by what Means, she could give no Account. She said, moreover, she had been several Times tempted to lay violent Hands on herself, at other Times on her own Children; of this she acquainted her Husband, but he took no farther notice of it, than to say, she was whimsical or magotty; but never took any Pains to consider, or find out what might be the Occasion of her disordered Senses. She declares, as a dying Woman, now sensible of the Heinousness of her Crime, that she could not charge herself with having ever before injured Man, Woman, or Child, that she was heartily sorry for what she had now done, and hoped her Suffering would be a Terror to all others, and be a Means of warning for the future against the Commission of any such horrid and barbarous Act.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175201130005"/>
            <p>She says she owed no Ill-will to the Mother, nor yet to the Child, that they had always lived very quietly in the House, without Quarrels, Words, or Blows. Immediately after Conviction, the Woman appeared for some Time stupid and senseless, she scarce took Notice of any Thing said or done; yet went backwards and forwards to Chappel, as the others did, tho' it was with great Difficulty she got up and down Stairs. In about a Fortnight after, she was quite drooping, and kept her Cell for a Week or ten Days, with a violent Disorder and Delirium, so that scarce any one that saw her, believed she would live to be executed. However, about a Fortnight ago, she began to come about again, and has appeared more livelyand sensible, than she had done since Conviction. During which Time, she has been frequently interrogated. As to the Affair, she was always in the same Way of declaring, that indeed she had done the Fact, but that she never thought of hurting poor Henny till a Day or two before she murdered her.</p>
            <p>The Fact she speaks of in this Manner; That having been, as related above, in continual Hurry of Spirits, she had often thought in that Time, to murder the Child, but never attempted it till the third Day, when, as it unfortunately happened, the Mother of the Child was gone of an Errand; there were left in the Room with her, her own second Daughter about 9 Years old, sick in Bed, and the poor Girl whom she murdered. Beacham on a sudden, seized hold of a Case Knife, and made an Offer at the Child's Throat, as it sat upon the Floor diverting itself. Upon which, her Daughter cried out, Why you wont murder poor Henny, Mamma, will you? She thereupon threw down the Knife, she says, and went to look out at the Window for the Child's Mother; but she staying upon the Errand, and not returning to Beacham's Expectation, she returned into the Room again, and taking the Knife, instantly murdered the poor Infant, by cutting it round its Throat, and giving it a Stab on the Side of its Breast. Her Daughter in Bed cried out for help, and was overheard by her Father; who, had he come directly, as soon as he heard the Cry, might possibly have prevented the Murder; but it seems, there were some Pales between him and the House, which he was not so expeditious in getting over, as 'twere to be wished he had been, but he unluckily stuck upon the Pales for some Time, so that others had discovered the bloody Scene before he came.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175201130006"/>
            <p>She seemed much better, and was ready to understand, and give Answers to what was said to her, since the Warrant for Execution came down, than ever she appeared to be before. She wept bitterly when the Affair was mentioned to her in private, but could give no farther or better Account than as above. She was thoroughly sensible, how much she merited her Fate, and said, as she had murdered the poor Babe, she deserved to die, and had no other Reason to desire to live, but for the Sake of her own Children, which are 4 or 5, whom she feared would not have that Care taken of them hereafter, as she had heretofore. She seemed to meet her Fate calmly, not insensibly, as if she had some glimmering Hopes, tho' shefrequently exprest her Doubts with Regard to her Happiness hereafter.</p>

His Parents dying when he was about nine or ten Years of Age, he was put into a Free-school in the Town aforesaid, where he learned only to read, and was then sent about his Business. He was never bound Apprentice, but took to Husbandry, and continued a <rs id="OA17520113-occupation-18" type="occupation">Day-Servant</rs> at several Places; till, about eight Years ago, he hired himself a <rs id="OA17520113-occupation-19" type="occupation">yearly Servant</rs> to a Farmer at Fullingham, in the County aforesaid. He seems to have been a very diligent careful Youth, and willing to learn to live in the World, by what he reports of himself; which is, that he always lived in the Esteem of his Masters, as he never neglected their Business; and moreover, what Money he got by his Labour he chiefly laid out in a very commendable Way; for, he says, he, together with some few others of his Age and Neighbourhood, employed a Person, after their Day-labour was over, in the long Winter-Evenings, to instruct them in reading and writing; by which he got a pretty Livelihood, and they received considerable Improvement; so that Dickenson was able both to read and write tolerably well.</p>
            <p>He says he had been constantly, for eight Years before he came to Town, in one Service at Fullingham, but that, indeed, he began to think it too great Slavery; and his Master putting him upon a Task he did not much like, i.e. having ordered him to driive a Herd of Swine the next Day to some neighbouring Market, he gave him the Slip in the Night, and resolved to set out for London. But better had it been for him to have drove his Master's Swine to any, than his own to this Market.</p>
            <p>He had not been in Town long before he was recommended to Mr. Knowles, Coal-dealer, in the <placeName id="OA17520113-geo-5">

The Thoughts of the Coin run in his Head Day and</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175201130007"/>
            <p>Night, and he began to set his Head to work how he should come at it. At length the fatal Night came, and being prepared with Instruments for the Purpose, he resolved to break the Bureau: He did so, and, after wrenching two Locks, he came at the wish'd-for Prize, the Money mentioned in the Indictment.</p>
            <p>As soon as he had got the Booty, he prepared to get off with it: He dressed himself, and having a Pair of Boots, he slung them cross his Shoulder, and in that Manner carried it off; for he took French Leave the same Night, and away he went towards <placeName id="OA17520113-geo-6">

Between Five and Six o'Clock in the Morning he came there fatigu'd and sweating with his Load of Care; but seeing a Light at the Ship and Dragon, he knock'd, and gain'd Admittance. As soon as he got in, he called for Meat and Drink, which while the Landlord of the House was gone to provide for him, he set down his Load from his Shoulder, and left it carelessly on the other Side of the Kitchen. He eat and drank plentifully, and thought it would never be Day; but his own Folly, too soon for him, brought to Light what he had been doing.</p>
            <p>After having refreshed himself, and drank a little freely, he began to wax warm, and was so free as to boast of his new Acquisition. Says he,</p>
            <p>"Come,</p>
            <p>"let's drink about; I have Money</p>
            <p>"enough, my Boots are full of Money." Upon which he fetch'd his Boots from the other Side of the Room, and began to pull out the Bags, saying, he had an old Aunt died, and left him 50 l. and he was going into the Country to live upon it.</p>
            <p>The Master of the House began now to suspect he had stole it, and accordingly laid a Trap for him, which the poor Fellow could not help falling into; his Appearance indeed not bespeaking one who might have so much Money at a Time of his own, nor yet be entrusted with it by any Body else, as at best he was but a poor, silly, Country Boy. Says the Master of the House,</p>
            <p>"I had a</p>
            <p>"rich old Aunt, and I knew where</p>
            <p>"she laid her Money, so robb'd her,</p>
            <p>"and came up into this Country,</p>
            <p>"and set myself up with it." This was only a Fetch to bring it out, if the Case were as he suspected; and accordingly the unfortunate Youth immediately reply'd,</p>
            <p>"I've done the</p>
            <p>"same, and robb'd my Master in</p>
            <p>"London, and am going into the</p>
            <p>"Country to set up myself." The Youth was immediately secured, and a Messenger sent for his Master, who, when he came, discovered the whole Affair. Dickenson was then taken before a Magistrate, before whom he acknowledged the Fact, and was by him committed to Newgate.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175201130008"/>
            <p>Tho' the Temptation were never so great, he was informed, had he had an honest Mind, it would not have got the better of his Virtue. And tho' it was suspected he left his Country for some bad Practice, he entirely denied any Thing of that Kind, and protested he never before had a Thought of doing Injustice or Wrong to any Body; and still repeated, that, had he not that Temptation laid in his Way, he never should have thought of any such Thing.</p>
            <p>But, tho' he was but a poor silly Country Boy, he had Invention enough to cut off his Irons. Tho' he had Books to read, yet a natural Inclination to Mischief was too strong for all Reading or Instruction. He got a little Knife, and made a Saw of it; but, at the first Attempt, it would not do; so he got another Knife, and did the same by it, which served his Purpose, and cut the Irons through. He said Macnamar had prompted him to it first, by telling him, that a Felon on the Common Side had begun to saw his Iron, and shewed him how easy a Matter it was to do it. However, he easily consented to it, and cut his own through in about three Days Time, working a little at a Time, as Opportunity served.</p>
            <p>After this was discovered, he gave himself up for lost, for before he had entertained strong Hopes of escaping; but being found out, he was double iron'd, and then he began to lament his Case, and to think in Earnest of preparing, in the best Manner he was able, for his latter End. He appeared afterwards very penitent, and died in Hopes of a better Life.</p>

They proposed to themselves, that if they could but get a Piece of Silk, it would be a good Booty, and they should get rich by it; having been spoke to by a Person, who buys stolen Goods to procure such a Thing for him, with a Promise of a good Reward, if they brought it him, against he wanted it, in five or six Days. They were determined upon it, and fixed upon the Time, which was no sooner come, than they, between one and two o'Clock in the Morning, attacked the Windows of the House, being prepared with Hammers, &amp;c. for breaking it open. But as soon as they began to work, a Dog that was kept in the Neighbourhood happening to be loose that Night about the House, and hearing the Noise they made, came running full-mouth'd at them, which spoiled their Sport. They were all three very young, Macnamar the oldest; so that now they had nothing to do but to take Care of themselves:They escaped the Fury of the Dog with no small Difficulty, Macnamar having his Coat more than half torn off his Back. This spoiled him for a House-breaker for some Time, and he returned to his little pilfering Tricks again, as he had done before.</p>

He said, that Dickenson told him, there was a Man in Lincolnshire Goal, convicted for a Rape, who got a Knife, and having notch'd it sawed off his Irons, and made his Escape in Women's Cloaths; and that if he could get a Knife, they might both soon have their Irons off. He says, Dickenson on Monday Night got a Knife, and notching it only against his own Irons, began to work that Night, but could not do it. On Tuesday Night he cut again, but coming to a Part which was Steel, he could cut no further. Then he took the Knife himself, but did not do so well as the other, upon which; Dickenson took the Knife from himagain, calling him Numscull and Fool, and said he could do better himself, so cut it thro' the third Night.</p>
            <p>These two poor unhappy Youths had deceived themselves with Hopes of making an Escape after their Irons were cut, by Means of borrowed Cloaths, or changing with each other, a Scheme, which had not the least Appearance of Success. After this Discovery, Macnamar too gave himself up; for before, he had entertained great Hopes, that upon Account of his Youth, his Life would have been spared.</p>
            <p>During the first Week or ten Days after Conviction, these two behaved in a very penitent Manner, with much Lamentation and Weeping; and as far as I can find, minded their Books very well, being in daily Expectation of having their Doomsday fix'd. But finding it put off, they gave some Relaxation to serious Thoughts, and it produced the above Scheme.</p>
            <p>We shall now see the Circumstances of the Robbery for which he was convicted; a most audacious Piece of Villainy to be undertaken by such Boys. Macnamar says, Guest led him into it, and shewed him the House, and which Way to attempt it. Be it so: However, he was so wicked himself as to go home to his Father's, a Carpenter, to provide Tools for their Purpose, and took his younger Brother from home along with him. To what Forwardness are Children now a Days brought! And, before he entered upon this Robbery, he went to a Shop under Pretence of trying a Coat, and running away with it, sold it immediately at another Shop for 15 d. which they drank out, and then went upon the Jobb. Guest stood without, and having broke thro' the Wash-house, Macnamar went in, and in Half an Hour's Time brought out Goods of divers Sorts to the Value of perhaps 10 or 15 l. Immediately they set out for <placeName id="OA17520113-geo-18">

He acknowledged the whole Affair, and said, he deserved to die; and when he found it must be so, he began to lament and bewail his Fate. He was but young in Years, tho' old in successfull Wickedness, of a hardened Spirit, tho' timorous to the least Danger; and, I fear, was not so much affected for what he had done, as that he was to dye.</p>

            <p>Upon his Return he was very well received by his old Friends and Companions, being a prime Hand, and one that carried a good deal of Sway among those Sort of People.

            <p>However, there was another Time when he very narrowly escaped the Rock he has at length split upon.

They, in Company, says Russel, committed many a Robbery, and as fast as they got Money, spent it in rioting with the common Women of the Town. After this Fact was committed, they went off, and skulked about for some Time; but the Prosecutor knowing Russel, hunted him from one Place to another, and soon after took them; and being carried before a Magistrate, were both committed, the one to give Evidence.
