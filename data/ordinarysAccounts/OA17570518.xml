            <p>while very agreeably, and bearing so good a character, that he was esteemed and well respected not only by his master, but likewise by all the neighbourhood. This account of him seems to me to be the more extraordinary, as he was confessedly during all this time almost an utter stranger to the inside of any church whatever, his Sundays being almost ever spent, not amidst solemn devout services, but in ranging the fields about this metropolis, in company with a parcel of idle profligate fellows. A strange source for a good character to flow from! Nor would at long run the mispending alone of the Sunday content him; the other six days were crowned with a total neglect of his master's business, and signal revellings with his dissolute associates. What would in all probability turn out the consequence of such wild proceedings was then alas! extremely remote from his thoughts young as he was and giddy. But the scene is now changed; and he, though not much older than he was then, is ever in earnest lamenting to the very inmost recesses of his soul, the corruption of his manners, by evil communication, and a habit of confirmed and consummate idleness. While at school he had employed his time to advantage, and could read well. Nor was he defective in point of sense, considering his youth, and was reputed besides a good workman. But what purposes did these qualifications answer? About six months ago he broke loose from his master's care and dominion over him, and very fatally subjected himself to an absolute tyranny, viz. that of his own uncontrolable passions. He flatter'd himself, at first, with hopes of escaping the execution of his sentence, in consideration of his tender years. But, as he found these to be vain and groundless, the warrant now for his exit being irrevocably made out, he followed the advice of his friends, to think of, and prepare for another, and a better life.</p>
            <p>He was ingenuous enough to own, that he had been terribly immersed in wickedness, particularly since he withdrew from his master's service: since which period, he had along with some companions, been lurking about the outskirts of the town, supporting himself wholly by pilferring and stealing. He was deeply touched at the thoughts of being hurried so early out of the world; confessed he had provoked the wrath of God in regard of diverse and sundry transgressions, and rendered himself liable to the resentment of the laws of his country too frequently; but utterly denied the forcible taking away the watch from the prosecutor, as was sworn upon his trial.</p>

Notwithstanding the powerful influence of inauspicious planet, under which he sprung into being, he served out his time very regularly, and stuck to the prosecution of his shaving business till August last, when by a sad reverse of conduct, he betook himself to schemes as distant as east is from west, from industry and common integrity, to the great surprise and concern of his friends. He might with a very small share of honest resolution have maintained himself with sufficient credit and character. Enormous practices he was not as yet engaged in; though from the folly inherent in him, and a manifest propensity to idleness, the destiny in embrio for him was not in the least mysterious to secondsighted personages. He was nevertheless very candid, and owned he had led a scandalous and profligate life. Some time last winter he was taken up by a constable, in order to be sent to sea, as an idle disorderly person; when some how or other, he had the dexterity to extricate himself from that difficulty; which in reality turned out of no manner of service to him, as it was only keeping clear of a small rock unhappily to split on a large one. He at first entertained great hopes of being excused from making a party in the projected approaching dismal solemnity; but how was his crest fallen, when he found he was distined to mount the cart, and to traverse <placeName id="OA17570518-geo-12">

Other people passing by, and the prosecutor telling his story, Marsh was directly secured. Not long after, Harris in hopes to</p>

            <p>avoid pursuit, ran into a house, and dropped the watch. But the pursuers being at his heels, he and the watch were delivered up to them, and both himself and Marsh were committed to prison. Harris would fain have turned evidence, but as he prevaricated in his declarations, when under examination, his offer was rejected. They both owned the stealing of the watch, and the carrying it away without the prosecutor's consent; but, as observed before, neither of them would acknowledge the forcibly taking the watch, tho' urged to it very strenuously. The evidence, however, given against them when tried, was deservedly followed by a verdict which the nature of it required, and they suffered accordingly. Both of them seemed to meet their fate in a very penitent and resigned manner: which appearance of sorrow, perhaps, had made no less impression on the minds of the spectators of their exit, in case they had not in their last moments denied their possessing themselves of the watch by violence. However, they declared they were heartily concerned on account of what they had done, and that they put their trust in the merits of Christ for their salvation.</p>

In short, had he been fixed and steady in his natural disposition, and attentive to his true and real interest, he could not on any occasions have been liable to the least temptation of having recourse to any scandalous expedient whatever, in order to procure a support for excess and extravagance. He was not without a partner of his bed and fortunes, having married a young woman he chanced to get acquainted with, very precipitately; but as providence has ordered it, there is no issue remaining of those nuptials.</p>
            <p>At the very time that Hughes married this woman, he was so far engaged with another, that writings were ready drawn, and only waited signing, which all parties concerned expected soon to be done, except Hughes, who by what he did, shew'd what he did not intend to do. So the one had the worst of the bargain, and the other had a lucky escape, by having no longer any concern with with him.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175705180009"/>
            <p>Hughes certainly carried on large business, and had an extensive acquaintance: But at the same time was wont to spend a great deal of his time in frequenting places where any thing of gaming was going forward. So that if he got money by his business, he had methods of disposing of it, perhaps often faster than he got it. He was used to associate in the general with people of tolerable circumstances, and good repute in the world; but some of his oldest acquaintance had of late years withdrawn themselves from his company. He appeared to be a man of no great share of understanding; but was self-sufficient, and of an haughty and arrogant cast of mind.</p>
            <p>In his religious attachments, if any he had, and charity will presume he was not utterly devoid of a sense that way, he was very loose; tho' it is certain, he was not too much addicted to attend the service of God at any place where divine worship was proposed to be celebrated. Better had it been for him, he acknowledged, he was brought to think, had he turned his thoughts that way in his more early days.</p>
            <p>But grasping after the things of this world was his principal concern. The darling object of his soul was wealth, while the ways and means of acquiring it brought him on the contrary to be most miserably poor. Not contented with the acquisitions arising from his avowedly sufficiently profitable employment as a taylor, having enlarged his desires he must also extend his concerns in life, and on that account took it into his head to enter into partnership in regard of a brew-house. By this step he flattered himself he should make his fortune presently. But the event turning out quite contrary to his expectations, his circumstances rather diminishing daily than increasing, his thoughts were wholly bent on bringing to perfection the scheme of iniquity, which was the cause of his infamous end. What he vainly imagined would keep up his head in the tide of prosperity, to his great disappointment he found plunging him in the very abyss of adversity.</p>

Now, whether he presumed upon the strength of this to clear himself from the charge to be laid against him when he dared to enter on a resolution of committing the offence, or whether he had lulled himself into a security of reigning undiscovered in the affair, he has reserved for his own breast intirely a secret. Though, in reality, in case he had entertained any previous reflections concerning the consequences of a discovery, one would naturally imagine he would have absolutely desisted from the perpetration of the fact. The fact, however he did perpetrate; and, when called upon to account for it,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175705180010"/>
            <p>he was so infatuated as to attempt to exculpate himself by means of the above-mentioned letter of attorney in justification of the act of having forged another.</p>
            <p>It was imagined by the generality of those that knew him formerly, that he was altogether unequal to the task of conducting an affair of this nature, which must essentially demand great penetration and segacity, without considerable assistance from some other quarter. However, he absolutely denied his having had any associate in regard of carrying on the scheme; which, indeed, at last had an instance of the greatest folly tacked to it, a demonstration it was all Hughes's own. This will appear from the following part of the narrative of his case, viz.</p>
            <p>Hughes's uncle had not many years since become owner of several shares in the joint stock of south sea annuities. These annuities the nephew longed to be nibling at, and to regale himself with, before in the common course of things they were like to contribute to the gratification of his desires. Now the usage of the south-sea house is this, viz. In case a person is appointed to receive any stock for an owner, application must be made to proper clerks for a printed letter of attorney, with blanks to be filled up by the clerks, as the nature of the case may require; which must be signed by the owner of the stock, and attested, in confirmation of the truth of it, by the minister of the parish where such owner lives, and by the church-wardens of the said parish, or by two justices of the peace. Hughes, coming at the knowledge of such usage, goes accordingly and gets a letter of attorney as above; which being obtained, he kept by him till such time as a return of the post with the instrument regularly executed and attested might be reasonably supposed. And in the interim he took care to execute and attest it after his own plan and design. Which being done, when he thought it a convenient time, away he goes with a most consummate assurance, enters this forged letter of attorney at the proper office, and in consequence thereof sold several hundred pounds-worth of stock. (If I remember right 'twas five hundred pounds) and converted the money to his own use. What became of it afterwards the lord knows, he did not choose to be touched upon that string.</p>
            <p>This done, what does he do next? Away he goes into the country to his uncle in Staffordshire, under pretence of paying him a visit; and that the old gentleman might be induced to believe his nephew had a great regard for him, he tells him, he had brought with him the interest, or dividend of his stock. The old man was somewhat surprized at it (another person a correspondent of his being used to receive it) but said nothing of the matter, while the nephew staid in the country, which was not long. As soon as he was gone,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175705180011"/>
            <p>the uncle wrote to <placeName id="OA17570518-geo-21">

            <p>Immediately information of the affair was made to a justice of the peace, who issued his warrant against Hughes, and Mr. Barnes, the high constable, apprehended him in his own neighbourhood. He fain would have gone home for somewhat he pretended he wanted, but Mr. Barnes did not choose to trust him, but took him immediately before a magistrate, who after a short hearing committed him to Newgate.</p>
            <p>He seemed to have very little concern about the matter before his trial. When he was upon his trial, he had recourse to the letter of attorney, before mentioned, to receive rents, &amp;c. for his uncle, to support himself in this unlawful fact of forgery; though that could not possibly give him any power to receive stock for his uncle; he at that time, it was granted, not being possessed of stock. The forgery however appeared so plainly against him, he had not a word to say in contradiction; for besides forging the uncle's, clergyman's, and church-warden's hands, he had set down a wrong christian name for the clergyman of the parish, and there were no such men, as he had put down ever church-wardens there, or even lived in the parish, and so he was deservedly brought in guilty.</p>
            <p>After conviction also he seemed not much to be concerned about it, but depended on the interest of his friends to save his life, insomuch as he had laid a plan how he should live abroad. But how greatly was he disappointed, when he found the day fixed for his execution! Then, and I am afraid, not till then did he think about eternity. And then he seemed to apply himself more closely to endeavour after, and use the means of making his peace with God, and died at last seemingly and declaratively resigned to the will of God.</p>

Hence he unhappily became intimate with Randal the evidence, his accomplice, seducer, and cause of his utter ruin, one of the same regiment, who was continually solliciting him to engage in robbing exploits, the revelling fruits of which he was ever painting to him in the most captivating colours. This Randal is of a highly distinguished character in his way, being inferiour to none in point of villainy, and consummate rascality.

The order was obeyed, and the serjeant, on visiting round, had opportunity of surprising those against whom Randal had made information, who being secured, and brought before a justice of the peace, were on such information upon oath committed. Interest was made to save the lives of the two poor young fellows above-mentioned, who might perhaps have been, if spared, no unuseful members hereafter to society.

            <p>A noble personage procured the place for him, and he had enjoyed it several years. Till this discovery of forgery, he was looked upon as a man of great use, and consequence in the office, nor was he in the least suspected of male-practice in the duty of it. But now, his life, in the general, not having been so upright and virtuous, as at last he was brought to wish it had been, he was sensible of it upon reflection, but particulars he would by no means be persuaded to suffer his tongue to utter. He had lived long in seeming character and apparent reputation, and he owned the dark shade, which the transaction for which he suffered had drawn over the quondam appearances, was sufficient to eclipse all the false glaring light which once surrounded him.</p>
            <p>The fact, which brought disgrace upon him proceeds from an abuse of that duty with which by his office he was intrusted. It is usual, it seems, that if any merchant brings any wines to England, and thereby receive such damage, as to be rendered unfit for sale, upon giving them up to the Custom-house, and being thereby put into his Majesty's possession, the duties which had been paid upon such wines, when first brought here and landed, entitles him to a certificate of over-entry, and the money is by means of such 'an instrument to be recovered again. Upon this account it was, that Adams set about to forge a certificate. How often this practice has taken place with him, neither he nor any body else will tell.</p>
            <p>The instrument we speak of (which Adams owned the publishing of, knowing it to be forged) was to certify, that a merchant had entered at the <placeName id="OA17570518-geo-53">

The certificate Adams set his clerk to fill up, specifying the duties of ten tons of wine, and the figures of the amount of the draw-back; which done, himself supplied the several names of other officers in the customs, which are required to make it compleat, and designed as a check, adding also the name of the merchant, which he made use of for the purpose, and his own as a witness to the merchant's endorsing it to them to receive the money.</p>
            <p>This is supposed to have been made on the 8th of February, and on the 9th Adams brought the certificate thus executed to the Receiver General's in the <placeName id="OA17570518-geo-54">
