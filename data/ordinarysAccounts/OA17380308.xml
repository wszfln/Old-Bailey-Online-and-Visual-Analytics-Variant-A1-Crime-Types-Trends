            <p>While under Sentence, they were exhorted to a sincere Repentance from these Words, Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out, when the Times of refreshing shall come from the Presence of the Lord, Acts iii. 19. I observed to them, that this Exhortation was made by the Apostle St. Peter to a Multitude of the Jews, who were met together to hear the Apostle's Doctrine; that these People were the same who had been the Betrayers and Murderers of Jesus Christ the Lord of Life and Glory. From hence I urged them to reflect upon the infinite Mercy and Love of God, in converting to the Faith of</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173803080003"/>
            <p>Christ these Jews, who had been the greatest of all Sinners; and advised them not to despair of Mercy, but sincerely to repent of the Errors of their past Lives, for there was yet Hope concerning them, that God would extend his Bowels of Compassion towards them, having declared, That he is merciful and gracious, long-suffering and patient, not delighting in the Death of a Sinner, but who rather by far that he should repent, be converted, and live.</p>

                  <interp inst="OA17380308n15-1" type="given" value="GEORGE"/>George Price</persName>, having been convicted of the most horrid Murder committed in the Memory of Man, as he was also guilty of other Murders and most heinous Sins, he had Admontions suitable to his particular Case. The Facts he had committed, were represented to him in their aggravating Circumstances, the Deceas'd being the Wife of his Bosom, whom he had murdered under a Pretence of Friendship. I represented to him the well-grounded Suspicion he lay under of being concerned in the Death of his Children; and he seemed to be very much affected when his unnatural Crimes, and aggravated Guilt, were laid open to him.</p>
            <p>They were instructed in the Nature of the Christian Sacraments, and of their Baptismal Covenant; and it was represented to them, how much they had been guilty of the Breach of these Engagements; and as they were soon to leave this World, they were exhorted to renew their Baptismal Covenant, by partaking of the Sacrament of our Lord's last Supper; which if they did in Faith and Love, and with contrite Hearts, they might become Partakers of all the Blessings proceeding from Christ's Passion and Death.</p>
            <p>They generally attended at Chapel, and behaved decently, <persName id="OA17380308n17-1">

Oliver and Mortished were likewise most of the Time sick; when I visited them they appeared penitent, and were attentive to Prayers. <persName id="OA17380308n17-2">

Of late he fell into bad Company, and he engaged with them in Picking Pockets; he never (he said) took any Thing himself, but received what was stole by others. The Robbery he was condemned for, was committed on the 24th of January, as his Majesty came from the House, just by the Palace; the Gentleman being sensible of it, and never losing Sight of him, two Men pursued him into a Barber's Entry, and the Watch was found between the Cloath and Lining of his Coat; he did not deny the Fact, but said he did not steal the Watch himself, but that it was handed to him by another, for he never had the Boldness to steal a Watch himself, his Business being to attend, breed Confusion, and run away with the Plunder, which was equally divided among them. He had been concerned in a vast Number of Robberies of this Kind for some Years past, but behaved well under his Misfortunes, and wept over them; he declared his Hope of Salvation thro' Christ, that he repented of a scandalous and wicked Life, and forgave all Men, as he expected Forgiveness from God.</p>

This was the Temptation to the Murder of his Wife, in whose Punishment the Justice of Divine Providence is very visible; for as she consented to her wretched Husband's Sollicitations, and to oblige him, had not only murdered two Infants about a Year and a Quarter old, in full Life,</p>

My Dear! For God's Sake, - if this is your Love, I will never trust you more! But he soon put it out of her Power to make any Noise, by drawing the Ends of the Lash with both his Hands.</p>
            <p>While she was in the Agonies of Death, he relented, and loosen'd the Whip; but before she recovered herself, it came into his Mind, that as he had begun, he must go thro' the Business, least the Attempt should provoke her to discover not only this Fact, but the Affair of the Children; upon which he fell to his devilish Work again, and twisted the Whip so violently round her Neck, that he broke the Handle in two Pieces.</p>
            <p>'Twas about Ten o'Clock when she was quite dead, and then he drew her out of the Chaise, and stripped off her Shoes, Stockings, &amp;c. when she was stark naked, he drew her to the Place where the two Men hang in Chains, and there he gave her that large Wound which the Surgeons gave an Account of on the Trial; he likewise gave her several Cuts over the Eye-Brows, and slit her Nose, that she might not be known, and that it might be imagined, she was robb'd, and stripp'd, and murder'd by Thieves. Her Cloaths he bundl'd up and brought to London, and to prevent any Discovery by them, he cut them into small Pieces, and dropt them Bit by Bit about the Streets; but she having told him what Things she had borrowed of Mrs. Barber, her Landlady, he imagin'd he should be requir'd to make Satisfaction for them, if they were not returned, therefore he contrived to send Home the Hood and the Cloak, as the most valuable Things, in the Manner that Mr. Barber and his Wife informed the Court in their Evidence against him, and this proved a Step towards the Discovery of his horrid Fact. He was asked (after his Condemnation) by a Relation of his,</p>

But recollecting himself as well as he could, he consider'd he must not stay in a Publick House, nor yet dar'd he to venture out in the Street, for being a very remarkable Person, he concluded he must be discover'd.</p>

The Farmer was not at Home, but his Wife told him, she thought he did not look like a Country Servant, or one that was fit for her Husband's Business. He told her he had liv'd well, but was now reduc'd; and should be glad to do any Thing in an honest Way to get Bread. She told him she could not say any Thing to it, he might stay if he thought proper till her Husband came in, and then he would have his Answer from him.</p>
            <p>When the Farmer came Home, and heard what he had to say, he look'd earnestly at him, (which put the Wretch into a Panic) and told him he wanted a second Plowman, but he was sure he would not do for him, he look'd (he said) as if he wanted to be hid for Debt, or something else. He own'd he was under a Cloud of Misfortunes, and would gladly serve him. The Farmer told him no, he did not greatly like him, but as 'twas Night, he might stay and lie with his Servants till next Morning. He was glad to have a House over his Head, tho' but for one Night, and thankfully accepted the Offer; but when the Servants (who lay in an Out-house) went to Bed, they were afraid of him, and told him, if he lay at their Farm that Night, he should lie in a Barn by himself in the Straw; which he was accordingly oblig'd to do.</p>

His Brother got Leave to accompany him to his Father's; when they came to the House, the Broher went in first, and burst out into Tears, for George had told him as they came along, what a Fact he had committed, and that he was forced to fly from one Place to another to avoid falling into the Hands of his Pursuers. The poor old Father having seen the Advertisement in the Papers, immediately apprehended something extraordinary had happen'd, and the first Words he said were, - Lord - you have seen George! I hope he's not in the Town! Yes, says his Brother, he's just at the Door, but he's afraid you might have some of the Neighbours with you. There being none but their own Family in the House, he was fetch'd in, and the Minute he saw his Father he fell down on his Knees, and with a Flood of Tears begg'd his Blessing. Ah George! (reply'd the Father) I wish God may bless you, and that what I have heard concerning you may not be true! No, no, (said he) it is not, - it is not, - pray let me have a private Room, - make no Words, I have done no Harm, let me have a Room to my self!</p>

Let me but have a Launcet, said he, and I will put an End to all; he was now satisfied, he said, and desired only to see his Friends, and now would make them all easy, for he would die with them. His Father and Brother perswaded him from his bloody Purpose, and kept him hid 5 Days. Then it began to be rumour'd about the Town, that George was harbour'd in the House, and the People were confirm'd in their Notion, by seeing Smoak come from a Chimney, where there never used to be a Fire before.</p>
            <p>The Rumour prevailing, he began to think himself not safe, even in his Father's House, and among his Relations. His Brother John perswaded dim to go on Board a Ship from some Sea Port and be gone, but it being windy Weather, he was afraid to venture at Sea.</p>

            <p>The following is the Defence which PRICE wrote, intending to have spoke it all on his Trial, but thinking it would be improper to produce the Paper at the Bar, he recollected as much of it as he could, and deliver'd himself as was express'd in his printed Trial.</p>
            <p>My LORD,</p>
            <p>I Declare, That I am innnocent of all that is laid to my Charge here in Corte; and so far from ever hurting my Wife, much less making away with her, such as murdering hur, or knowing of her being murdered in any Shape, I will take my Oath, that I know nothing to the contrary but what she may be living to this Day, no more than what your Lordship and the jentlemen of the Jury has an Opportunity of hearing from jentlemen, who, upon their Oaths declare, that they se hur after she had been murdered in a barbarous Manner; but it is plain, my Lord, that it is a Sceem of Vilany that has been laid against us both, but whear it spring from I know not; but I hope, and doubt not, but by that Time your Lordship, and the jentlemen of the Jury, has hard me declare the Manner of its being acted, but that you will think me inocent, as I realy am; God forbid but what I should, for I loved my Wife as I did my own Sould, and she merited all my Love, had it been more than what it really was, for she was a modest, virtious, sober, good-natur'd Woman; if she was not so frugall in the Manedgement of the litle that we had to begin the World with, that tended to our Misfortune only, and thear was nobody else could bear aparte; that I bore with Patience, and to confirm which, my Lord, if there is that Person in Corte, or that can be fetch'd in, that can say, George, you have used your Wife ill, or you have abus'd hur in any Respect, or not don for bur to the utmost of my Power, nay more than was in my Power, for I was forsed to troble my Frinds to compleat my Tenderness to hur, if those things can be laid to my Charge, then let your Lordship and the whole Corte, blame me for my Actions; untill then, I hope your Lordship will put charitable Constructions, together with the jentlemen of the Jury, upon the Folly that I have been guilty of, which was, that of leaving my Master's Servis as I did; but eaven that, I was not without my Reasons, and such and such as I dout not but will move your Lordship's Compassion together with the hole Corte, to pity my Surcumstances, and insteed of thinking me that Villan that I have been represented to the World in the publick New's-Papers, as I doupt not but your Lordship, upon inquiring into my Carector, will finde me to be a more tender harted Person than he that should be guilty of such Barbarity: Justice I am not afraid of, my Lord, or I had never come without being forced to look your Lordship and the jentlemen of the Jury in the Face. Gilt is a Stranger to me, thearfore I stand without carn upon my Triall, only for the Loss of my poor Wife. My Lord, I have no Frinds to make intersetion for me in Corte, only God for my Counsellor, and Inocens for my Defence, for hear I expect no more Favour than what Justis gives me a Title to, and that I don't despair of, having no Remorce of Conscience. If I was shure, my Lord, that my Death would add to my Wife's Happyness, I wovld willinly sacrifice my Life for hur. I think, my Lord, that thear is several Parsons in Corte, my Lord, who wear both Eie and Ear Witnesses to my tender Usage, that has Reason to think that what I say is Truth, if your Lordship pleasis to hear them speeck.</p>
            <p>This bold Defence I made,</p>
            <p>My Life being sweet;</p>
            <p>But Fortune did in Corte,</p>
            <p>With Justice meet.</p>

            <p>After his Conviction, he was asked if he had any Hand in the Death of his Children? His Answer was, As God Almighty is to be my Judge, I know nothing but that they died a Natural Death; my Wife sent me Word they were restless and could not sleep, and I own I sent them some Liquid Laudanum, if she gave them too much, I cannot help that.</p>
            <p>A Reverend Clergyman having seen the Letters which were found in his Wife's Lodging, and hearing he continued solemnly protesting his Innocence in this Respect, out of a compassionate Regard to his Condition, he paid him a Visit, and advised him to an ingenuous Confession for his heinous Crimes, and in particular for being a</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173803080014"/>
            <p>Moves in the Death of his Children. He again affirmed his Innocence in that Respect, and deny'd his having any Knowledge how they came by their End. But when the Revd Clergyman let him know his Letters to his Wife were in Custody, which were too flagrant a Proof of this Wickedness, he fell in a Passion, and after he had thrown out some angry Expressions, he grew sullen, and could not be perswaded to speak, or give any Answers to the Questions which were asked him. Thus we may plainly see what Regard is to be paid to the most solemn Asseverations of Wretches harden'd in Guilt, and habituated in a constant Course of Wickedness; and that 'tis too often seen, they are more concern'd for appearing innocent in the Eyes of the World, which they are about to leave, than they are for their eternal Interest, and everlasting Welfare.</p>

            <p>My dear Father,</p>
            <p>PRay for the Peace of my departing Sole, and in your Praiers forget not to return God Thanks for all the Mercys he has vouchsaft to me your Child, in bringing me so calmly to Justis, not taking me unawares, and lancing me into Eternity without giving me Time to say, Lord have Mercy upon my Sole. But that has not been the Case with me, for God has been flow in his Anger, and of great Kindness, and has given me Time to repent me of the Evil that I have comitted. I have been with my Burthen upon the Seas, when the angry Waves seem'd to me to threathen me, and the foaming Billows knock'd against my troubl'd Conscience. Then I call'd upon the Lord to save me from the Waters, and he heard me, and suffer'd me to travel some hundreds of Miles, but wherever I stopt my uneasines continu'd, even in Bed, let me turn how I would my Burthen was uppermost. Thus I liv'd for two Months in this deplorable Condition, which God thought long enough, at length he influenc'd my Heart with a Scriptur Proof, which was for those that traveld and were heavy loaden to turn to him and he would give them Ease. This Thought I cherisht, which brought me forth to Justis, and in the Time of my Confinement, God gave me that Grace to spend my Time in praying for Forgiveness of my Sins, which I did with Fervency, and God saw that in the Prison, where he planted, that I brought forth Fruit meet for Repentance, which was a forward Step to bring me to his Kindom; for tho' upon my Trial I made a bold Defence, and there being no plain Proof against me, yet God took Pity on me, and rathar then that I should be turned into the wide World a second Time, choose to take me to himself, and 'tis in this last Hope I quit this wretched Being, in Hopes that God will have Mercy upon my Soul, which I don't dispare of in the least. Pray my dear Father don't think much of parting with me, for I don't think much of parting with this wicked World, for Death is the Punishment God has appointed for Sin, and since my Sins has deserved this Punishment, I am contented to make this earthly Atonement, in sacrificing my Life for my Crimes. There is another Thing that attends the Fraelty of human Nature upon these Occasions, which I hope will be banish'd from you and my Brothers, 'tis that of fearing the scandalos Reflections of your Neighbours if at any Time, or upon any slite Quarrel that may happen between you and them, they should say, which you must expect, so well I know the Town, your Son suffer'd so and so, when they have nothing else to say that can move your Temper, in the midst of your Quarrel when you find these Words spoke, make this Reply with a pleasant Countenance, - God forgive you, I pity you for this Speech you have made. I shall soon be happy I hope, so let that reconcile you, much better than if I had gone into some foreign Country, to escape Temporal Punishment, and be banisht from you and all my Friends besides, and perhaps have spent the remaining part of my Life in rioating. But as Fate has ordain'd it, all those future Things are prevented. I pray God to bless you, my dear Father, and my dear Brothers and Sister, if you have any Thing to say to me, 'tis now too late to let me know on Earth, I hope we shall meet in Heaven, there our Hapyness will be compleated, and it will be out of the Power of our restless Adversaries to disturb us, Adieu. Which is the last Lines you must ever expect to receive from your truly penitent Child,</p>

            <p>I Little thought that the World would be so censorious to me, as to report it, that I should make any unlawful Pretensions of Love to you, they may be justly call'd unlawful, had there any such been made, because I had a Wife at the Time for which I suffer, now some of the World to compleat their censorious Constructions, will not scruple to say that you ought to bear a Part with me in my Troubles, because they think you have been accessary to my Crime, not Crimes, tho' I have been charged with more then one by the World, but God thought one of that Sort sufficient, so suffer'd me to comit no more, but for that God requires Blood for Blood, and in an Act of Submission to God's Will, I am content to sacrifice my Life for my Sins, in the Destruction of this corruptible Being. I think my Curiosity would be but laudable if I should consult some learned Divine, to know whence it is, that Vice should get the Preference in receiving the Reward before Virtue. You Madam, no Doubt have heard what Death is design'd for me, but I have heard of no extraordinary Reward that your Virtue has mett with. But upon second Thoughts, when I consider that my whole Life has not been spent in Disobedience to the Will of God, 'tis possible, and to be hop'd that the Punishment I meet with on this side the Grave, will be a sufficient Attonement for my Crime. But to those that has had the Benefit of your Conversation, it appears that your whole Life has been a Life of such Virtue and Discretion, that this World is not able to furnish you with sufficient Rewards for your Merits. But be contented and patient under the Reflections (is) cast upon you, your Virtue will not go unrewarded, no more then will my Vice go unpunisht, my Desires in this Letter is to show the World the Justice that is done me, and the Wrong they do you. My Design in this is good, the reading it in one Sense may have one ill Effect, because it will make Servants more cautious how they show common Civility to each other, for fear of the like Reflections being cast on them.
