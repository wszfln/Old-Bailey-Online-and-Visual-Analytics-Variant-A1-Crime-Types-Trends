            <p>On the Morning of his Execution he was brought up to the Chapel and received the holy Sacrament. About nine o'Clock he was put into a Cart and carried to Tyburn. At the Place of Execution he exhorted all to take Warning by him, and to keep from the Company of lewd Women, for they had been the Cause of his Destruction, and had brought him to this untimely End. Soon after he was turned off, earnestly praying that the Lord would have Mercy on his Soul.</p>

He continued in this happy Frame of Mind all the next Day, and till he came to the Place of Execution. I asked him there, how he found himself? he replied, "Quite composed and resigned to suffer." He also added, " I " have no Fear of Death; Death will be to me the Beginning of a better Life.</p>

But when I reasoned with him of Righteousness, Temperance, and Judgment to come, he trembled, and cried out, "What must I do to be saved!" I strongly exhorted him to employ the few Moments he had to continue in this World in Prayer to God for Mercy. Ever after he constantly attended the Chapel, and seemed deeply sensibly of his sinful Course of Life. So that there is some Reason to hope that he also found Favour with God.</p>

Stone and he had been acquainted for some Time; and they both declared it was not the first Time they had taken Things, though of less Value, from the Merchants, which they did not look upon to be so heinous a Crime at that Time as it really was. They both desired that all of their Profession would take Warning from them, and not defraud others at all, lest the Habit should grow upon them, and they should at last suffer in the manner they did. Moreton, while under Sentence of Death, behaved very decently and seriously, and expressed a hearty Sorrow for his Sins, and earnestly prayed that God would have Mercy upon his Soul. He continued in this Situation of Mind till he suffered.</p>

            <p>Warehouse, in which Moreton then worked. They determined he should take the Key out of his Master's House, and that they would take away a whole Barrel, and destroy the Cask, that they might not be found out. They made this known to J - A -, who told them he would go with them, and help them to carry it off, which wicked Design they put in Practice, November 27. They then all went into the Warehouse together, took away the Indigo, and threw the Cask into the River. J - A - disposed of it for them. This Mr. Stone declared, as he was a dying Man, to be the Truth.</p>
            <p>After he was under Sentence of Death he never denied the Robbery. He appeared deeply convinced of the Heinoushess of his Crime and the Sinfulness of Sin. He told me, He was sensible that unless God gave him true Repentance, and the Pardon of all his Sins, he must perish eternally; that he thought his Sins were so great that God would not have Mercy on him. I told him, That though his Sins were great, yet the Mercy of God in Christ Jesus was infinitely greater; and that if he truly repented of them all, and earnestly called upon God for Mercy, he would pardon him. I was informed he spent whole Nights in Prayer, and I believe God heard his Prayers and answered his Petitions; for on the Sunday Morning before he suffered, while I was preaching, he was very much affected, and prayed very earnestly. He told me afterwards he was very happy, and the Fear of Death was taken away, and that God for Christ's Sake was reconciled to him, after all that he had done. There was a visible Change wrought in him; for when any of the Prisoners behaved indecently, he reproved them, and prayed to God to shew them their Sin and Danger. He continued in this happy Frame of Mind till he gave up his Spirit, I trust, into the Hands of God.</p>

            <p>Upon his Trial there appeared many Circumstances which proved, beyond a Doubt, that he was guilty. These, with the Evidence of B - , caused the Jury to bring him in guilty.</p>
            <p>On Monday he received Sentence of Death, after which he positively denied the Fact. I told him it was very clear that he was either guilty of the Robbery or accessary to it. He still denied it, and said, If he died, he should die innocent of the Crime laid to his Charge. When he came to attend the Chapel, he was deeply affected and wept bitterly, and seemed to have a great Concern for the Salvation of his Soul. I laboured to shew him the great Danger he was in, and told him, that if he died with a Lie in his Mouth, he could not expect to find Mercy at the Hands of God, but must look for a fearful and dreadful Judgment at the last Day. I also added, That for the Sake of those who had been accused and were innocent, he ought to declare the Truth. He then</p>

            <p>burst into a Flood of Tears, and told me, If I would not divulge it to any one while he was living he would relate the Whole. I assured him I would not. " O Sir! said he, I am an unfortunate young Man; I have " Reason to curse the Day that I ever knew B - , D - and C - , " for they have been the Cause of my Ruin: I got acquainted with " them about eight Years ago." He added, " About six Years ago I " was out of Place, and Mr. C - at that Time lived with Mr. " M - . B - and I wanting Money, we all agreed to rob Mr. " M - 's Chambers. Mr. C - gave us an Account of the Room, " and where the Money was, and of a particular Window at which we " might get in. Mr. C - said, Seeing we are acquainted, to avoid Suspicion, he would give Warning and leave his Master and go into the " Country. At the Time appointed, Mr. B - and I took two Ladders and tied them together, and B - went into the Room and took " the Money and all the Things of value he could find. I received four " Guineas and a half of the Money. The Rings we melted down and " disposed of them with the other Things. As to the Robbery in <placeName id="OA17641217-geo-22">

About two Years and a half ago, I went to live with my " Lord Harrington, where I had a very good Place. But the Expence " I was at on Account of the Girls I kept, and the extravagant Company I frequented, made me think of committing another Robbery " that I might have Money to supply my Wants. Mr. B - came " to see me, and asked, if my Lord was not rich? I told him I believed " he was, and I would endeavour to find out where he kept his Money. " Accordingly I went, as often as I could make an Excuse, into the Room " where my Lord was often by himself. I have seen him counting his " Money and putting it up in the Bureau, which Mr. B - broke " open, more than once. Two or three Days before we committed the</p>

            <p>" Robbery, Mr. Bevell told me, he had been for Money to pay some " Bills, and that he would have me be in the Way, that when the People came for their Money I might get somewhat of them. I told " B - of it, and desired him to come on Saturday Night and we " would have all the Money ourselves. That Night a Letter was " brought to my Lord, which I carried up, hoping to see where the " Money was laid. I saw my Lord putting up a considerable Sum, at " which I rejoiced. I went out of the Room, and stood listening at the " Door; and that I might be certain which Drawer it was put in, I " went back to ask his Lordship for a Frank. In the Evening B - " came, and was in my Lodge till all the Family were in Bed. We " then went up Stairs and broke open the Flap of the Bureau, and the " Drawer that was under it, with a Gimblet and Chissel which I had got " out of a Box in the House; and we took the Money and the other " Things mentioned in the Indictment. These B - carried off immediately. And I, in order to avoid Suspicion, left the Door open " that the Family might think some Thieves had picked the Lock and " robbed the House." This he declared to be the Truth.</p>
            <p>He said he freely forgave every one of his Enemies. He prayed very earnestly for Mercy, and told me, that sometimes when he was praying he had hopes that God would have Mercy upon him; but when he thought of the Heinousness of his Crimes he was afraid he never would. Two Days before he was executed, he and the rest received the Holy Sacrament; and Mr. Weskett said he was much comforted.</p>

            <p>On the Morning of Execution,</p>
            <p>I attended them, and a little after six they were all ready to go into the Chapel; there they received the Sacrament, and spent two Hours in earnest Prayer. About nine o'Clock they were put into two Carts, and about ten they came to the Place of Execution. Mr. Weskett put a white Ribbond into his Hat, for wearing of which he gave this Reason: " I believe I am come to an untimely End, in order that my Soul might " be saved; and I look upon this as my Wedding-Day." At the Place of Execution I spent about half an Hour with them in Prayer. At eleven o'Clock they were turned off, earnestly calling upon God to receive their Souls.</p>
