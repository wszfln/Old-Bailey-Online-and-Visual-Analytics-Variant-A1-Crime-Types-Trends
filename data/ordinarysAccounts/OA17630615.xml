The cry having alarmed others, these ran away as fast as possible; but were pursued by several, and all soon taken, secured, and committed.

Dennison, Swift, Brown, and Smith otherwise Turner, without making any distinction; he seemed to give good attention, and be well affected, saying, he would be glad to continue to come up with these four. But it is observable,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176306150004"/>
            <p>that after the first visit from the visitor of his own persuasion, he came no more, but kept his distance in all respects. A case, which we have often had occasion to regret, and wish to be remedied! For surely it is right and equitable, that as their clergy are not treated according to the letter of the law, and excluded from visiting them within our office and charge, so neither should they make an ungrateful use of this indulgence, nor preclude the free choice of their people, by prohibiting them to profit by our means.</p>
            <p>Dennison reported himself to be about 26 years of age; was a tall; well-made man; well-tempered, tractable, and willing to comply with any good advice, since he fell under my care. This is the more remarkable, and a matter of thankfulness to his friends, who thought him hardened and insensible when they visited him in <placeName id="OA17630615-geo-14">

It is too probable he quitted it without a proper discharge; and we hear of him next in the sea-service; to which he acknowledged to me, he had deserted from that of the military. He served his Majesty as a <rs id="OA17630615-occupation-15" type="occupation">sailor</rs>

Being at a loss how to account for this, I questioned him farther; when he fairly owned, he had run from them all: nor could he stay on board any one of them longer than he had an opportunity to get off. This he imputed to ill-treatment; and asserted, that no private man would serve longer than he could not avoid it. On this point I reasoned with him, being of a quite contrary opinion, and that it is the best service in the nation. He then owned, it might be so in some ships that were well officered and regulated, but quite the contrary in others. Surely he must have had bad fortune who never met with one such ship in 6 or 7 which he had tried!</p>
            <p>He now professed himself to be fully sensible of his past follies, earnestly desirous to return to those good principles in which he was educated, and for this purpose constantly attended the service and instructions in the chapel, in which he behaved with serious attention and devotion. The other three converts of our persuasion did also duly attend; and it should be remembered, to the credit and advantage of poor <persName id="OA17630615n19-1">

            <p>Dennison, when questioned, seemed daily more sensible of his sin and danger, yet not without hope of hat divine mercy which he professed to use his utmost endeavours to obtain.</p>
            <p>A few days after conviction and sentence passed, notice was given of the intended administration of the holy com</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176306150005"/>
            <p>munion; proper tracts were put into their hands; one on this subject to be used in their cells, which they now promised, and daily professed to make a good use of. But lest this should not be effectual, a course of daily instruction on that and other necessary subjects was added to this, and given them in common, at the time of prayers in the chapel.</p>
            <p>We were also often accompanied by several kind and good neighbours, who delight to frequent the daily prayers of the church, and especially on these sad occasions. To pray for, and assist, by their good example, these poor dying criminals, in the practice of a duty, to which they themselves, had hitherto, alas! been too great strangers. May such seasonable, pious, and charitable intercessors be blessed, and their number increased in every christian congregation!</p>
            <p>When the prisoners were visited, June the 9th, the day after the death-warrant was known, Dennison being asked, how he was, and how it affected him? answered, " It made no great alteration in " his mind, as he expected it, and had " done his best to prepare for it." And in truth he appeared calm and resigned, professing to believe that this chastisement was sent in mercy to call him from his sins to repentance, and the way of salvation.</p>
            <p>The respited men were this day particularly applied to and warned, " That " on themselves it must now depend, " whether they, or those devoted to a " speedy execution, had the better lot, " according to the use they should severally make of it; that if they should " return to their former wickedness, it " were far better to be cut off now, than " when loaded with new degrees of " guilt, aggravated by the abuse of " goodness and forbearing mercy; that " this respite is but for a moment, of farther trial, in comparison of eternity, " an eternity already in some sense commenced, in respect of the immortality " of the soul, and those rewards, or " punishments that must a wait it."</p>
            <p>But the real truth is, that the best intentioned, and most sincere amongst them, when respited and turned out of the cells, among a number of the common-side felons, find it very difficult, if not impracticable, to stem the torrent of wickedness, which too often prevails there over every good purpose or practice; all which, in every shape, is made the jest, the scoff, 'tis well if not the object of violence and persecution, to the prevailing majority.</p>
            <p>And these unhappy people often plead this in excuse for not continuing in the good professions they made, when confined to the cells, and under the fears of a speedy death: from whence, when removed to the common side, they become like a standing pool, unsupplied with fresh springs, or wholsome streams, covered up from the dew or rains of heaven, they stagnate, are tainted, and breed all manner of foulness. So are the minds and morals of these pining prisoners corrupted and debased, their bodies and constitutions withered and decayed, before they are delivered by death or transportation.</p>
            <p>"Wherefore it is the ardent wish of every humane and considerate person about this goal, whose eyes and ears bear witness to this sad case here represented (but with the utmost deference and submission to our honoured superiors in office and power, to whose exalted station these scenes rarely appear, and then diminished by their distance;) that the deplorable</p>

            <p>case of respited prisoners were laid to heart, frequently looked into, reported, and duly relieved, as to their wisdom shall seem meet: whereby much evil might be prevented, and much good produced; whereby these delinquents, being removed to some situation in our most extensive colonies, and usefully employed, might render some proportionable recompence to their country, and the world for the evils they may have done; and their lives, instead of being a burthen to themselves, and a pest to society, become a blessing to both."</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, of June the 9th, it was recommended to Dennison, to recollect what facts he could, and to confess them, for the quiet of his conscience, that neither the innocent might be blamed, nor the injured at a loss for any fact of his; especially as such confession, and his prayers for the injured, was all the satisfaction he now had in his power to make. In compliance with this advice, he acknowledged he had been out the night before this fact he was to die for, and had taken a hat and wig from a man near <placeName id="OA17630615-geo-17">

            <p>" O Lord, thou art the searcher of all " our hearts, and a discerner of the " very thoughts; and in whose sight " all things are naked and open, I do " in all humble manner confess all my " heinous crimes before thee." - Concluding with this prayer:</p>

My will I now resign into thy hands, desiring that thy will " may be mine, both now and for evermore. Amen."</p>
            <p>After this he expressed his earnest desire to partake of the holy sacrament, to which being instructed and prepared as before mentioned, he was admitted on Monday the 13th instant, by which he was much strengthened and composed to wait for his approaching fate with a steadfast and calm resignation.</p>

            <p>Though this boy was scarce 15 years, and but little for that age, yet by the love of idleness and ill company, he became no small proficient in his bad practices. Stupid, incapable, and averse, as he appeared to better kinds of knowledge, he was sharp enough at this. This seemed to be his unhappy character, by his whole behaviour, and the best accounts I could learn of him. A loud lesson this to children to hearken to good instruction, to love and seek for useful knowledge with diligence; and to flee from bad company: And to parents to make their duty early familiar and pleasant to them.</p>

His father complained, he could not keep him within bounds when ashore, as his friends say he had been 8 or 9 months, but kept out of their way. When his father saw him now and then clean dressed and better supplied than he could expect, he used to ask him, where do you get these things? I hope you do not steal; plainly warning him what his end would be, if he did. He has since said he got into a bad gang of more than 40; about which when I questioned the boy, he owned there might be about 10 or 12.</p>
            <p>Application having been made by his friends for a favourable report, on account of his tender years, &amp;c. they were answered, that his case should be laid before his majesty. When they found he was however included in the death-warrant, they thought of applying to the throne for mercy, as I presume they did; but still feared, that as the number of boys, in this wicked and fatal course, has of late been very great and alarming, he must be made an example, to convince them that their youth shall not protect them.</p>
            <p>He daily attended the chapel, where particular care was taken to make his duty, and the instructions there given, easy and familiar to him; besides which he was put into a cell with one of the protestant convicts who could read to him, and was willing to teach him. This task was undertaken by Brown, till he was respited, and after him by Dennison; and each of them seemed to assist him to the best of their power. He was advised and permitted to be present and attend carefully when the communion was administred to Dennison and others, on the Monday before they suffered. This in some degree opened his understanding, and gave him a desire to perform that duty; for which purpose, being questioned at several times, after the plainest and shortest instructions frequently repeated to him, he came to a hopeful sense of the nature, design, and benefits of this sacred institution, and then, with the advice and approbation of several intelligent christians, was encouraged to prepare himself to be admitted to it the morning he suffered.</p>
            <p>It should have been mentioned, that his father and step-mother came to visit this poor young sufferer, the day before he died; when it appeared, by their account of him, that thro' a childish fear and the wicked habit of lying, he had misrepresented several parts of his past conduct and proceedings; that he had run</p>

            <p>away from that master to whom he was bound apprentice; and whom he reported to have died in a French prison; that he had learned to read tolerably, and write a little during the three years he was at school. This he owned, when asked again, but said he had now forgot both.</p>
            <p>His sorrowful father, when asked why he did not train him better, and keep him within bounds? answered, that he had done the best he could for him, and blamed the boy's unruly temper and behaviour: for that, after he ran away from his master, he had been six months lurking about; and when called to an account, and questioned by his father, pretended he belonged to this and t'other ship, now at <placeName id="OA17630615-geo-33">

To extenuate this charge, he told me, <rs id="OA17630615-occupation-25" type="occupation">he had sometimes hired himself to work in a boat on the river</rs>

            <p>His step-mother told me, she visited him on Sunday last; and when asked by her, what he thought of himself? he answered, he expected nothing but to die. Ay, but said she, that is not all! you have a soul to be saved, or lost forever; and that is what you should think of. But he, being made proof against such doctrines by the company he kept, turned his head and sneered. His father added, that he declared he never would impeach any of his gang, but would die as hard as ever a man died. As this account of him alarmed and troubled me, after so much labour as had been laid out on this poor young profligate; and as I understood, it was told me with a view that he might be brought, if possible, to a better temper, I took him closely to task again, as has been partly related before. In answer to this last charge of his resolution, to die hard, he denied it; and when explained to him with its dreadful consequences, he said, with many tears, and a most piteous face, God forbid I should die hard! and to convince me he was not so, he answered me any question put to him, viz. that he was guilty of all the four indictments which were now distinctly read to him, with some other facts besides, committed in the space of three months he had been in this way. And this gang, some of which he named, being the same he was indicted with, &amp;c. who were his accomplices and had drawn him in; such as stealing some check shirts out of a slop-shop in <placeName id="OA17630615-geo-35">

A question being put, Why he did not go to sea when his money was out? It was answered, That he had prize-money due to him about 20 Guineas more for the Havannah expedition. His landlady (or mother as the tars call them) in hopes of fingering this also, persuaded him to stay with her rather than go to sea, but he never received it.</p>
            <p>His behaviour after conviction was sullen and sturdy; he laid him down in his cell for four or five days and would not stir, not even when sent for by his priest; who on this occasion went up to his cell and talked to him. His excuse was, he could not come for want of a shirt. Though this excuse was soon removed by a shirt being brought to him, he still refused to come for some time; at length, with difficulty, was prevailed on, and after this, kept attending pretty well to the last.</p>
            <p>Chapman was much given to drink and to quarrel and fight in his liquor, but when sober was quiet enough.

The lad explained his sense of the holy communion plainly and intelligibly according to his capacity, and expressed his earnest desire to receive it: and, having given satisfaction to the present congregation that he was a proper subject of it, he and Dennison were admitted, and partook of that holy ordinance in a devout and becoming manner. To which a word of exhortation and comfort was added to support them in the way.</p>
            <p>These two were carried out in one cart, and the other three in a second, about nine, and came to the place about ten. Dennison behaved with remarkable devotion to the last. At a proper interval in our prayers, he read a word of warning to the people, written by himself and entirely his own.</p>
            <p>" My friends and brethren,</p>
            <p>" I write these few words to you, that " you would take my advice. I intreat " of you, in the name of the Lord, that " my ignominious death may be a warning to you all; that you may cease to " do evil, and learn to do good, and " turn to the Lord with all your hearts, " and humbly confess all your sins and " unrighteousness to God, and pray un</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA176306150012"/>
            <p>to him to give you that sincere repentance that need not be repented of. " And if you will not take my advice, " but keep in a wicked course of life, " you must expect to receive that dreadful doom pronounced upon you at the " great and dreadful day of judgment, " when the son of man shall come in " power and great glory, and shall cause " the last trumpet to be sounded, and he " shall say, Arise, ye dead, and come to " judgment; and the dead shall be raised; they that have done good, to the " resurrection of life; but they that " have done evil, to the resurrection of " damnation.</p>
            <p>" My friends, take my advice, and " turn to the Lord your God, whilst you " are on this side of hell. You hear the " dreadful doom of the wicked, if they " do not turn to God whilst there is hope. " I hope you will lay this close to your " hearts, and forsake all your former " sins, for Jesus Christ his sake, who " died for your sins. Amen."</p>
            <p>All this he spoke with deliberation and zeal, adding a prayer wherein he desired all present to join with him, (as they did) full of penitence, and hope; wherein he heartily thanked God for sending his son Jesus Christ into the world to save repenting sinners, professing it was by the grace of true repentance, he was enabled to call other sinners to repentance, and to declare the salvation of God through Christ. All that heard and saw him, seemed to be much affected.</p>
            <p>In a word; his last expressions and devout aspirations seemed strongly to demonstrate the Divine particular auroe of the more discerning wits of Greece and Rome, consonant to the sacred language of the breath of the Almighty; and the Spirit returning to God who gave it. The circumstances of a little lad suffering with him heightened the distress. He saw his afflicted father close to the caar, weeping and wringing his hands, the poor boy returned tear for tear; the multitude were greatly affected at the sight, many turned away and dropt a tear, unable to bear the sight with a dry unconcern. After Denison had ended, the boy spoke out and desired " all young people to take warning by him." He would have said more - to keep the commandments, and obey their parents, but was at a loss for words, and broke afresh into tears.</p>
            <p>The other three, Chapman, Forsit and Ryley, formed a little circle by themselves, as it were, to exclude our prayers, and seemed only to attend to something which one read or spoke for the rest. When invited to join with us in prayer, as being all christians on one foundation, Forsit answered, There is but one God, but many ways to worship him. He then added a word, by way of blaming his officers for non-payment of his wages and prize-money, for want of which he was reduced to necessity, and brought to his present fate; he desired none might reflect on the woman he kept company with. Being asked if he had a wife? he said he had one instead of a wife. Having again prayed for them all, and given them a final blessing, we parted, and they quickly suffered their dreadful sentence.</p>
