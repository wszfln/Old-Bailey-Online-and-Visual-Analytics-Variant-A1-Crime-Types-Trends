He says, being a very unlucky boy, and not minding his master's business, he got himself frequently corrected, which at that time of day he looked upon as ill treatment. This at last he resented so, that he run away from his master; but not only this treatment from his master was the cause of his elopement, but thro' the solicitations of <persName id="OA17550512n12-2">

But the spirit of idleness was frequently too strong,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175505120004"/>
            <p>and prevailed over his inclination to industry. However, he says, he did not quite break out for 12 months, but all that time Banks, and other companions, were continually teizing him, till they got him away again. Soon after his father died, so that he had no body to return to but his mother, who took no great notice of him. 'Tis the custom, he says, amongst these unhappy wretches, if they know of any boy, that has once been a thieving, never to let him rest, if he pretends to retire, till they have him out again upon the lay.</p>
            <p>He had now by frequent robberies made himself uneasy, and was under fear of being brought to justice; so taking the advice of a friend, he resolved to go to sea. And having got a birth to the <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-9">West-Indies</placeName>, he took to the <rs id="OA17550512-occupation-12" type="occupation">sea-faring man</rs>

But returning from the West-Indies to <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-10">London</placeName>, he was not long before his former companions found out the young sailor; and after helping him to spend what little money he had got, 'twas not long e'er they persuaded him to follow them to the same practices as formerly he had done.</p>
            <p>'Tis six years ago, he says, since he first began to go a thieving; and shop-lifting was the chief attempt of him, and his companions, in which he had been so very successful. (tho' scarce a day past he was not concerned in one of the greater, and less account) that yet he never once got into trouble as he called it (the usual phrase of these sort of people when apprehended for felony) till last October sessions.</p>
            <p>He was then indicted, and tryed with two others at the <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-11">Old Baily</placeName>, for a robbery committed upon <persName id="OA17550512n17-1">

The prosecutor acknowledging himself to be drunk at that time, and giving but a very bad account of the matter to the court and jury, the three prisoners were acquitted.</p>
            <p>West owned the fact however, and said that they did attack O'Brian with a design to rob him, and took away his hat, and some small matter of money, and that <persName id="OA17550512n18-1">

But, as the prosecutor was so stupid, as not to be able to tell the day of the month, nor so much as the month when this</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175505120005"/>
            <p>affair happened, his escape at that time might be owing to want of evidence to support the indictment.</p>
            <p>Having thus luckily escaped, he having no thought of being thankful to God, or of keeping out of the way of such danger for the time to come, returned again to the old place of rendezvous, and met his old acquaintance. After drinking together an houror two, (for 'twas towards the evening when he was turned out) he says, he and others went out, and committed a robbery near <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-14">Marybone</placeName>. He says, as fast as he got any money he squandered it away, having always some companions of the viler sort, both male and female, waiting at his lodgings, or other places of resort, for his return, which was scarce ever without some booty. For he was reckoned one of the most artful little rogues in the ways of contriving to bring about a design of shop-lifting of any of them all.</p>
            <p>He says, as observed before, that scarce a day pass'd on which a robbery on the high-way, or in a shop, was not by him committed. And at the sessions in February last, we have him an evidence against one of his accomplices, <persName id="OA17550512n21-1">

And yet, when Banks was apprehended he sent to West, to come in voluntarily, and turn evidence against him, lest somebody, that might swear harder, should be produced against him.</p>
            <p>So West, having been concerned with him in diverse robberies, gave account of several robberies, none but what were liable only to transportation. Tho', he says, he might have hanged him, had he not had more regard for him, notwithstanding he was the first and chief instrument of leading him on to his ruin.</p>
            <p>Upon two of the robberies he gave information of at that time, indictments were found and tried; in which West deposed, that he and Banks going about the streets in <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-15">Tyburn-road</placeName>, to see what they could get, he went into a hosier's shop, and stole several bundles of stockings, amounting to 27 pair, and sold them for 8s. and 4d.</p>
            <p>And, being out together upon the same account the 1st of January, loitering all day in <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-16">Moorfields</placeName>, at night he and his companions went into a cheese-monger's shop in <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-17">Goswell-Street</placeName>, and stole two Cheshire cheeses, and a firkin of butter; one of which and the firkin West took out of the shop himself.

            <p>West and his companions lurking places and haunts were chiefly at <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-19">Marybone</placeName>, <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-20">Tyburn-road</placeName>, and the squares about that part of the town, tho' now and then they made excursions to other out parts of London, and almost every night some body's property fell a sacrifice to their ravaging geninuses. Their booty was still squandered away in disorderly houses, and company, and at last he was taken in one of the msot infamous places, and in a house where, by general report, no other sort of people resorted but pick-pockets, hosue-breakers, and shop-lifters, to get rid of stolen goods, the purpose, West says, he and his companions went there for.</p>

He was the unhappy offspring of a family that lived in good reputation in <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-22">Oxford-road</placeName>, and he might have been better brought up than he was, if his own inclinations had not crossed their good intentions for him. He was put to school, he says, but what was bestowed on him in that way was all in vain, he being of a disposition not inclined to instruction, or advice; he says, he has no reason to complain of want of care in bringing him up, but for want of grace, and faith to believe that others knew what was best for him, rather than himself. His father, he says, was never wanting to take what pains he could to bring him up in the fear of God, but to no purpose; as soon as he was out of hearing, he forgot all good impressions attempted to be made on him; which unhappiness, while under conviction, he very much lamented, and, as far as I find, was thoroughly sensible of his unworthiness and folly, in having so long turned the deaf ear to all friendly admonitions; and agreeable to such a way of thinking, did he demean himself all the while till he suffered.</p>

With these he unhappily joined forces, and went a robbing with one or other, if not all togethr, almost every day in the week. In abundance of robberies he owns himself to have been concerned, but says, he always avaided abusing any body, nor would he suffer others to do it in his company, as West testified of him; who said, he believed Pryer had prevented much mischief being offered and done. Having thus brought pryer and West together, we are to look into some of those actions, in which being concerned together, their joint ruin as to this world succeeded. Pryer was in custody in February sessions, when West was evidence against <persName id="OA17550512n29-2">
                  <interp inst="OA17550512n29-2" type="gender" value="male"/>

                  <interp inst="OA17550512n29-2" type="given" value="WILLIAM"/>William Banks</persName>, who was transported the very day the report was made last, and the warrant for execution signed. But, tho' West knew many a robbery pryer had been concerned in, yet would he not give information against him; so for that time he got his liberty again, for want of evidence and prosecution.</p>
            <p>But not so fortunate was the next time: as did his partner and fellow sufferer, he soon forgot the danger he had been in, and went on a fresh score; till at last he was taken in <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-29">St. Giles's</placeName> where he now frequently was seen, and chiefly resorted; upon information of an accomplice. Cane, who was also an evidence against him.</p>
            <p>An information was received from a watchman of the parish to which it belongs, against a house in <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-30">Blackboy-alley</placeName>; upon which, the high constable, and some other constables, with a file of musketeers, went there, and first met with Cane; who, upon terms of being admitted an evidence, informed them of the goods which were lately stolen from a shop near the Bull and Gate in Holbourn, and which the robbers were come there to dispose of. Accordingly, upon search, the goods were found, and West being there, was taken into custody, together with one Wright, who were taken before Mr. Fielding. The prosecutor being acquainted with the goods being found, came to the justice's, where they were, and swearing to them, West and Pryer were committed for stealing, and Wright for receiving. An indictment for this fact being preferred to the grand jury, was found, and after a fair trial thereupon, Pryer and West were capitally convicted, having nothing to say in their defence. But Wright had the good luck to escape, which West advises may be a warning, and</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175505120008"/>
            <p>says, had he not had the encouragement he had from the receivers, who would take all they brought, tho' at a low price; as witness the goods now we are talking of, for which was given only 45s. little more than a quarter part of the value they stand at in the indictment.</p>
            <p>West says he took them out of the prosecutor's shop, and gave them to Pryer, and at Banks's mother's 'twas resolved that Cane and West should go and sell them to Wright.</p>
            <p>West was a second time indicted for stealing, on the 13 March, 14 pair of worsted stockings, the goods of <persName id="OA17550512n34-1">

He was tried on this indictment, in order that the receiver might be convicted too, if he was found guilty. West was, upon full evidence of Cane and others, found guilty, and <persName id="OA17550512n34-2">

            <p>Pryer was also a party in the robbery, but somehow or other left out of the indictment, when both acknowledged to be a fact by them and others committed.</p>

            <p>Pryer after conviction behaved very well, but West not quite so well. Pryer, tho' ignorant to the greatest degree with respect to letters, and having scarce ever seen the inside of a church, shewed greater degrees of contrition than did the rest who died, and was a youth of an active mind, tho' wrongly applied. Had either of them taken a proper turn in their tender years, there was understanding enough in either of them to have made useful members of society. But a certain ememplary dissoluteness seemed to have taken hold of them both, and no danger of loss of life, or liberty, had any effect to put a stop to their way of life. West says he was so thoughtless, as not to trouble his head about being hanged, till he was convicted. And Pryer says, that he was generally kept</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175505120009"/>
            <p>in liquor, so that his senses were lost to all thoughts of what might be another day.</p>
            <p>Such young and tender plants, 'tis pity they should grow in soils which send forth such exhalations as must be the cause of nipping them in the bud. And but that we too frequently see it, we might hope, that by means of such salubrious laws and customs as this nation is possessed of, a stop might somehow be put to such numbers of youth, searce entered into the world, having it in their power to destroy, and throw away life, before they are acquainted with the value of it.</p>
            <p>What was the bane of these two poor wretches, was their too early initiation into the company of dissolute and disorderly persons, before they were acquainted with, or had considered the consequence which entering into such a way of life would produce; not but that they knew what must one day ensue upon detection of such crimes, as they suffered for committing. But, had they, when they begun, had the same thoughts which afterwards haunted them even to their last moments, they declared their fears might have prevented them. But when they had become hardened by frequent undiscovered acts of opposition to laws, human and divine, they found themselves so become enemies to society, that they could associate with none but those of their own stamp.</p>
            <p>They both died in all appearance, and from their own declarations, penitents, and hoping their examples might prove a warning to the young and unwary, desired security for their happiness hereafter, under the mercies of God, promised alone in the merits of Christ.</p>

He says he was offered twice the money for the mare, more than he sold her for, eighteen miles off, before he came to <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-43">London</placeName>; which, he said, was proof he did not intend to sell her, had he not been over persuaded, and in liquor. He acknowledged however, in all circumstances, the justice of the law in the punishment he received; and hoping God would forgive him what he had done amiss, upon his repentance, died resigned, in expectation of life in happiness hereafter, thro' the merits of him who died to save sinners who repent and turn to him.</p>

His master suspecting it must be Gould that had robbed him, made search after him, and with difficulty at last found him. But Gould was stubborn, and denied he knew any thing of the matter. The master, in danger of being ruined by the loss, in order to persuade him to own the fact, and let him know what was become of the goods, promised to say no more of the matter, if he might but have his goods again.

            <p>while, upon his master's earnest intreaties, and saying, he must be ruined if he suffered the loss, Gould told the truth, and the goods were recovered to the master's great joy.</p>
            <p>In a short time after, he took himself away from his master's service, before he had learned any thing of the trade, and was an idle boy about London streets, for a long while. Having no trade, nor any body to take care of him, he lived by picking pockets, and stealing any thing that came in his way.</p>
            <p>About three years ago he was tried at <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-47">Kingston</placeName>, for a felony committed at <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-48">Guildford</placeName> in <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-49">Surry</placeName>, and convicted in order for transportation. But his friends interceding for him, his punishment was changed from transportation to whipping, and he underwent a severe whipping, thro' the town of <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-50">Guildford</placeName>.</p>
            <p>About eight months ago he was committed to <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-51">Clerkenwell New-prison</placeName>, for felony, but at the sessions was discharged for want of evidence. He had the good fortune thus to escape for many years; and tho' he made no doubt. he should one day or other be surprised, and suffer for all, yet he comforted himself with hopes, that whenever it should be that day came, his punishment might be only transportation. And, he did say, when he found himself capitally convicted, he hoped he should not be hanged, but if he was transported for life, he should not mind it. For a long while he persisted in it that he knew nothing of the robbery for which he suffered; but having been severely afflicted with sickness, and dreadfully frightened at the thoughts of suffering death, he chose at last to acknowledge that, and several others, committed by him, and one <persName id="OA17550512n53-1">

            <p>On the 1st of March they made another attempt, and being better prepared for it, succeeded. About five o'clock in the morning, they came to the shop again, and by the help of a long knife, and pick-lock key, which Gould says <persName id="OA17550512n56-1">

He remembers it was about five o'clock in the morning when it was done, he says, because while they were in the shop, the watchman going his round, beat at the door, and cried the hour.</p>
            <p>They disposed of some of the shoes that day to by a Sunday's dinner, and on Monday morning Gould took a pair of second hand shoes to man in <placeName id="OA17550512-geo-57">Field-lane</placeName>, which he fold for 3s. While he was making the bargain, a person came to the shop to acquaint Mr. Murray of the robbery of Mr. Mazarene's shop. Gould heard what was said, but was silent, and so infatuated after all to take Mr. Murray home with him, and shewed him a large quantity of shoes, which he pretended to bargain with Gould for, that so he might have an opportunity to detect him. He pretended to go home, and fetch the money, and then come and take the shoes away; instead of which, he went directly to Mazarene, and acquainted him with what he had seen.</p>

            <p>The reason he gave since conviction, for clearing Edwards, was, that he had a wife and children, and she was then big with child, and he would not inform against him, left his being in trouble should hurt her, in the condition she was in drawing very near the time of her travail. But, as Edwards immediately made off, and never came to his succour in his distress, he resolved to tell the truth, or else all would have died with him. And had it not been for the prosecutors's bounty to him, after conviction, being very ill, he might have starved, and died before the time of execution.</p>

They broke open a hatter's shop, and stole several hats, the same night they first attempted Mr. Mazarene's shop, and missed their aim. They were resolved however not to return errandless, for all was fish that came to the net, and hats that were in general worth a guinea, or five and twenty shillings, they disposed of, and pawned, one for seven shillings, another for six shillings, and a third for five shillings, in and about Goodman's-fields. Gould was prevailed upon to tell where he had pawned them; and there were found, three hats, as he directed, which as</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175505120013"/>
            <p>I'm informed, he has obliged the pawnbrokers to bring home to his shop again. The terms, I hear also, they readily complied with.</p>
            <p>Another night they broke open a man's shop in Spread-eagle court, who is a taylor, and stole from him a laced coat and other things. The coat, by Gould's direction, I'm told, he recovered.</p>
            <p>A poor woman's shop, who is also a taylor in Christopher's court, he says, they broke open, and stole a blue coat, a pair of black velvet breeches, and several other things, which he did not recollect. The breeches, he says, he sold to a woman that cries old cloaths in the streets, whom he knew not; but the coat the poor woman has recovered, by his direction.</p>
            <p>Several other shops, he says, they attempted, but did not succeed. Being asked, whether in carrying away their booty (as what they did get did not lie in a small compass) they never were seen, or interrupted by the watch? He replied, they did meet them sometimes, but were never molested. Particularly, the night they robbed Mr. Mazurene's shop, and carried away seven dozen pair of shoes in bags upon their shoulders, they met the watchman in Bartholomew-lane, who took no manner of notice of them, not so much as to ask what they had got with them.</p>
            <p>After he had thus disburthened his mind, he grew better in health, and more lively and being sensible the fate he was to suffer was no more than his crimes had in justice deserved, he died resigned, in hopes of pardon thro' Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p>About eight months ago he got a hurt in his left arm, which rendered it useless to him for some time. And he made use of that as an argument, why he should not attempt to go upon the highway. But, 'twas only pretence, for tho' he could not use it so well as before, yet it was not so useless at the time he went on his exploits, but that he might have made use of it to support a pistol, when his other hand was otherwise employed. When he was taken, tho' the people robbed in the Birmingham coach did not positively swear to him, they all did believe him to be the man. The horse, that he rode, they were positive in swearing to, which horse, both the owner and his servant swore he had hired at the time the robbery was committed. He went out with the horse the morning the robbery was committed, and time enough to be at the place where the robbery was committed, and the evidence against him was strong enough to persuade the jury of his guilt, and justly he was convicted. He was in a great hurry and fright after receiving sentence, and soon seized with such horrors, as threw him into a strong fever, so that he was delirious for sometime; and his wandering thoughts, were in that condition, were still busied in talking of his wretchedness. But when he was little recovered, and consulted about the unhappy methods he had taken to bring himself to that unhappy condition, he refused to acknowledge his guilt, tho' urged to it in the strongest terms. He continued to the last in but indifferent health, tho' sensible of what was said to him, but would not directly own the fact; tho', before he died, in the morning of the fatal day, he would not deny it. I'm sure he had some evil counsellors about him, tho' I could not find out certainly who they were, yet I had a shrewd suspicion. During the time of his having the horse our, the Exeter and Salisbury Stage-coaches were robbed by a person, who seemed not perfectly to have the use of his left hand, as was his case. Being desired to put the question to him, 'twas done, but he would neither own, nor deny. Of all the unhappy of this fort, I ever ment with, I scarce ever met with one so obstinate, or who shewed so little inclination to make appear that he had any proper sense of the evil ways which had brought him to that shameful and ignominious death,</p>
