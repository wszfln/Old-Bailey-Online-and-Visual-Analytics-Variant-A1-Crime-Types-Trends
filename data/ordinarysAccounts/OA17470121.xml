Immediately after they had committed this Robbery, they robbed two other Gentlemen coming along the same Road, from one of whom they took 19 s. 6 d. and from the other 6 s. 8 d. and his Whig and silver Buckles. By which time the Post-Boy had got to the Crown at Kits End, and had alarm'd the People, a Number of whom immediately arm'd themselves with such Weapons they could find, pursued Barney and his Companions, and came up with them. Lynce, like an experienc'd General, when he found his Pursuers gained Ground of him, dispatched three of his Companions forward with the Baggage (who in their Flight threw away their Booty for fear of their being overtaken.) In the mean time he, with the remaining three, stood their Ground, prepar'd for the Enemy, and, soon as they came within Pistol Shot, Lynce let fly at them with his Horse Pistol loaded with a Brace of Balls, taking all the Aim he possibly could, with an Intent to kill, if he could, being the only time, he says, he ever shot at or attempted to kill any Person whatsoever; and so near was he to it now, that one of the Balls went through the Hat of one of his Pursuers: However, this so terrify'd the People who pursued them, that it gave them time to make their Escapes, and they got clear off, and came to <placeName id="OA17470121-geo-68">
