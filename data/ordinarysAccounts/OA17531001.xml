The poor Girl says, she scarce knew what he meant by talking to her of a Husband, but found there was a Resolution to marry her off, and she was obliged to submit to it.

Her second Husband was a labouring Man, who maintained her pretty well by his Labour, and she, to help out a Maintenance, worked at her Needle, when she could get any Thing to do. She says they lived pretty comfortable together, and by him she had two Children; which Providence was pleased to take to himself while they were very young.

But, upon the whole, that she had been loose, and idle, and too much addicted to drink Gin, and keep bad Company, she did not deny. She said she was very sorry for it, and had often reflected on Ways and Means to get rid of such bad Practices; but not being able to get herself into a regular way of Life, she found the Task too difficult to extricate herself from the Miseries, and ill Consequences, that attended her being exposed to Necessity in a wide World, without any one Friend to assist her in getting into any reputable way of Life. As she was a Woman of Pretty good Breeding, so was she also endued with a tolerable Share of Understanding, for one in such unhappy way of living, as had been her Lot.</p>

Wood staid below in the Kitchen; and, he says, whatever was lost from thence, he must take it. For, he sent him up with a Sack to clear all above, as soon as they came into the House; but being disappointed by finding People in the House, contrary to their Expectation, his Heart misgave him, and he thought best to make off the Ground, as fast as he could, without taking away any Booty, and was glad to get away himself. However, it pleased God, he was soon overtaken, and apprehended, and brought to the Watch-house. And, being taken before a Justice of the Peace, he did not deny the Fact, because 'twas in was so to do, and was committed to <placeName id="OA17531001-geo-48">
                  <interp inst="OA17531001-geo-48" type="type" value="site"/>

            <p>He laboured very hard with the Justice to be admitted Evidence, but to no Purpose. After he had made Confession of the Fact, and put his Mark to it, he wanted the Justice to convert it into an Information; but what was done, that Gentleman did not think proper to alter.</p>
            <p>Upon his Trial, being called upon to say, what Defence he had to make, he proceeded to confess the whole Affair, just as the Prosecutor set it forth, and he had before confessed to the Justice.</p>
            <p>After Conviction he behaved very quietly, and seemed to take on the Appearance of Sorrow. He was very loath to own any intimate Friendship he had with Wood at the first, and pretended only a very slight Acquaintance, as if he had seen him very seldom, and that accidentally. But before he died, he did own, that he had been for some Time past made a Tool of by Wood, and others, that accustom themselves to that most wicked, and terrifying Practice of House-breaking, whereby great Advantage had accrued to Wood, and others, and he had only such an Allowance out of their Booty, as they thought proper to give him. He says, that Wood has a House furnished with all Manner of the best of Goods, obtained by this most flagrant Practice, carried on to the great Prejudice of many unguarded People, who, retired from the Hurry and Business of the World, little think of such unwelcome and dangerous Visitors.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175310010012"/>
            <p>He says, these sort of People, who thus by Night disturb the Repose of, and pay these felonious Visits to their Neighbours, have a very deep laid Scheme, whereby to carry on these Male Practices. Some among them, who can read, perusethe News-Papers, to find out what Families are gone into the Country, and then they watch the Houses to see, whether they are entirely shut up, or whether any of the Servants remain behind, and manage Things accordingly. They keep Picklock-keys, and wrenching Irons for the Purpose. And, if they find a House shut up, as this was, they visit it in the Dead of Night, and ten to one but they succeed, and plunder at their Pleasure. But, if it so happens, that none of their Keys will touch the Lock, they find out, where they are wanting, and against the next Opportunity are sure to suit a Key, that shall do the Work. This, he says, has been a Practice of those, he has been concerned with, and great has the Mischief been, which he has had Knowledge of, since he was concerned in House-breaking. Thus Wood told him that House was empty, and tempted him, by saying, He could put Money in his Pocket. His own Account of the Fact, upon his Trial, seemed to argue that he was a Novice to these Ways, as he had not learned to put any Gloss upon the Matter, nor to call any to Character.</p>
            <p>But this Opinion soon went off when we came to converse together a little more closely, and his evasive Methods of disclaiming any great Knowledge of his old Acquaintance, or their Ways, appeared more and more. And he thought the better of the Matter at last, and would have opened more largely the wicked Ways he had been in, had not Defect of Memory, and the greater Care for Hereafter employed the Time. He seemed to be Penitent, and put his Trust in the Promises of God through Christ.</p>
