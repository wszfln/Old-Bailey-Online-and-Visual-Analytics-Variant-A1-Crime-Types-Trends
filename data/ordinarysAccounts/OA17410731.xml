            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174107310004"/>
            <p>While under Sentence, they were all seriously exhorted to prepare for Death, from these Words, Mark the perfect Man, and behold the Upright, for the End of that Man is Peace, Psalm xxxvii. 37. From whence I took Occasion to lay before them, the Difference between a good and a bad Life; the great Joy, and everlasting Reward, that will hereafter be the Portion of all those who live a godly, righteous, sober, and unblameable Life here, that they may, as they certainly will, as is promised by the Mouths of the holy Prophets, receive Eternal Life hereafter, for Blessed is the Man (says the Psalmist) unto whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity, and in whose Spirit there is no Guile. Whereas, the wicked, abandoned Wretch, can expect nothing but Misery in this Life, as well as in that which is to come. Would Men but consider, that there is, that there must be, a last, a great, a solemn Day of Account, when all Men must appear in their true and genuine Colours, where nothing can hide them; how joyful must it be to them, who have done their Duty, and liv'd righteously, &amp;c. to hear the Sound of Come ye Blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, &amp;c. But, alas! how dteadful must it be to those wicked Men, who have disobeyed, the Commands of their Maker, have lived riotously, &amp;c. to hear the tremendous Sound of, Go ye Cursed into Everlasting Fire, &amp;c. Would Men, I say, but consider this wide Difference, surely they should never so much sin against the Lord.</p>
            <p>While these, and such like Ejaculations were pouring out upon them, I could observe them in general to be very penitent, and even to week. on which I endeavoured to comfort them, by exhorting them to have a lively Hope and Trust in the Goodness and Mercy of Almigh-God, who has said, That when the wicked Man turneth from his Sin, and heartily and sincerely repents thereof, he shall save his Soul alive. And again 'tis said in Scripture, That there is more Joy in Heaven, over one Sinner that repenteth, than over Ninety and Nine just Persons. In the New Testament, our Blessed Saviour invites all that labour and are heavy laden under a deep Sense of their Sins, to come unto him, Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest. Take my Yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye shall find Rest unto your Souls, for my Yoke is easy, and my Burden is light, Matt. xi. 28, 29, 30.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174107310005"/>
            <p>They were likewise exhorted to consider, that as they had fallen so greatly from their Baptismal Vows and Engagements, from the Grace and Favour of God, so they had the greater Reason to be more penitent, and endeavour to renew themselves again, by making solemn and sincere Vows and Resolutions of persisting in the Service of God, and for the better enabling them in this great Work, to make Preparations for the receiving the Sacrament of our Lord's last Supper, wherein our baptismal Vows and Resolutions are renewed, and we are disposed for the everlasting Fellowship and Communion of God and Christ in Heaven.</p>
            <p>They were also admonished, how unjust, how dishonourable, and how irreligious it is to rob Mankind of their Right and Property, how directly contrary and destructive it is to all Society in general, turning every Thing into Disorder and Confusion, which makes it absolutely necessary that their should be Laws enacted for Punishment equal to Crimes, and that all who are guilty of Rapine and Plunder should die, for 'tis better that some Individuals perish as Victims to the Law, than that the Community should suffer or perish by them.</p>

            <p>Our first Adventure was upon a Quaker, who came out of Yorkshire; him we met in <placeName id="OA17410731-geo-43">

I went up to him first, and gave him a Chuck under the Chin, and at the same Time asked him to treat me with a Glass of Wine. He, Gudgeonlike, greedily swallowed the Bait, and asked me, if I knew ever a Place thereabouts, where we might be accommodated. I quickly conducted him to an House in that Neighbourhood, we drank two or three Pints of Wine by ourselves, and then Madge, who knew her Cue, enquired after me, and was immediately conducted to us in the same Room, by the Drawer. When she came in, my Chap was very merry, and likewise very amorous, and I finding I could persuade him</p>

            <p>to almost any thing, I asked him to go home along with me to my Lodgings, which he readily consented to. So paying our Reckoning, we all three went away. I not thinking him safe till I had made him quire drunk, conveyed him in our Way to a small  Boozing and Fence Ken, where we drank several Drams, till my Chap began to be quite mellow, and it began to grow pretty late; from thence I proposed to go Home to our &#8214; Mill Ken. Now Madge was gone before to prepare for our Reception: We walked through several Alleys and Turnings before we arrived at our intended Port, which made honest Yorkshire say, Zaunds! Ise think we shall nere get to this Hause of yours. Yes, my Dear, we shall presently; and so we did too soon for him poor Man. When we came to the Door, we was let in by my Sister in Iniquity, Madge, who, as soon as we had got upon the Stair-case, let the Candle fall on Purpose, that we might be in the Dark. Hey-dey! says Madge, what shall we do now? the Candles out, and I can't find the Tinder-box. Oh! says I, my Dear and I can find our Way, and do you grope about, and see if you can find the Dram Bottle. So conducting my Spark up Stairs, I plac'd him upon the Chair near the Bedside, and sat myself down by him. We had not sat long before he fell fast asleep in the Chair, having, as I observed before, drank pretty hard, and being very much tir'd. As soon as we found him in this Condition, we began to examine the Contents of his Pockets, and found upwards of 15 * Ridges, besides a &#8224; Rum Fem upon his Finger. We not being content with this, took his  Wedges out of his &#8214; Stomps, and observing before, he had a pretty rum outside and inside &#8224;&#8224; Togee, we pull'd them off, and made free with them likewise. When we had so done, we roll'd him up in a Blanket, and laid him upon the Bedstead, and went away and left him in that Condition to our ** Bidings, and snack'd the Cole: The Togees and Wedges was divided between our particular Spouses, one of them we sent early the next Morning, to see the Issue of this Adventure. When he came there, he found the poor Countryman in the House, with a great Mob of People round him, wrapp'd up in the Blanket, like an AEgyptian Mummy, almost mad; some commiserating his Condition, others blaming his Folly.

When our Friend came back, and told us how Affairs went, we judg'd it most proper not to go back again for some Time. Some few more Tricks of this Nature oblig'd us to quit our House for good and all.</p>
            <p>Some small Time after these Adventures, as I was stroling down Chancery-lane, I met with one <persName id="OA17410731n60-1">

When we came there, we fixed ourselves at some Distance (but within Ear-shot) upon a Bench near where he stood. We had not been long there, before a Couple of well-dress'd elderly Men, came and sat down by us. We judged by their Actions, that they were Women Haters, and sooner chose to have to do with one of their own Sex, than with ours. After they had sat by us sometime, without speaking, one of them gave me a gentle pull by the Coat, which Motion I could not understand; at last one of them broke Silence, and thus accosted us. I think, Gentlemen, it is a mighty fine Evening: Yes, Sir, reply'd I, 'tis a charming Night. Laird! my dear Soul, says the other to Sally, you and I have been together some where before, and at the same Time gave her a Squeeze by the Hand. Some few more Expressions, too obscene and shocking to mention, passed between us, and they thinking us Men, and fit for their Purpose, began (it being dark) to use closer Familiarity. Sally who knew her Cue, gave a loud Hem! and immediately up comes her Friend, who found us with our Breeches about our Heels. Hey-day! what's going forward here, a Parcel of B &#8211; gg - rs, I'll secure you all, and have you hang'd; and at the same Time pretended as if he would alarm the other Centinel. We begged for Heaven's Sake, not to expose us, and we would make him a Present of a considerable Value; which Motion was seconded by our two old Sparks, who was terrified</p>

Then they pulled out their &#8214; Tatlers, and tipp'd him them likewise: As soon as they had so done, he asked us what we had to give him, but before we could give him an Answer, the Sharks begged to be dismist; which Proposal was readily agreed to, so they took their Leaves without much Ceremony, and marched off with great Precipitation, scarce bidding us good Night. When they were gone, we went and divided the Spoil; and as soon as our Spark was dismist from his Post, he met us, and we went and feasted with these execrable Wretches Money, who, if I had my Will, should be burnt alive. We got several Booties by these Means, and lived well upon our Business; but Sally's Spouse dying, reduced us to think of something else for Support, we fearing to turn out by our selves, least we should be brought into any Scrape, and having no Man to stand by us.</p>

I made no Answer, so supposed that he put his Hand into his Pocket to feel for his Money, for he presently after cry'd out, Ruin'd and Undone! Robb'd! here Watch! Watch! I hearing this, thought it was no Time for me to stay any longer there, so contriv'd to slip by him unperceiv'd. Some small Time after the Watch came up with a Light, and going into the Alley, I stood on the other Side of the Way, talking to Sally very gravely, who had follow'd us, and watched all my</p>
            <p>&#8224; Money in their Pockets.</p>
            <p> Guineas.</p>
            <p>&#8214; Watches.</p>
            <p> Drunken Man.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174107310015"/>
            <p>Motions; as soon as he came into the Alley with a Light, a poor Woman came down upon some Occasion or other. As soon as the Spark espied her, Oh! says he, this is the B - h that has robbed me of all my Money, and immediately charged the Watchman with her; and notwithstanding all the poor Woman could say in her Defence, hurried her away to the Watchhouse; we follow'd her at some Distance, being anxious for her, knowing we deserved her Misfortune. When the Woman came to the Watch-house, she was searched, as we could hear by the Bustle made within the Watch-house, and nothing found in her Pocket, except about Eight Penn'orth of Half-pence; but the Man persisting in what he said, they was both sent to the Compter, where they remain'd till the next Day; when Sally and I, being very uneasy, we agreed she should dress herself pretty smart, and go to the Compter to enquire into the Affair, and if Occasion requir'd, she was to declare before the Justice, that as she was coming by accidentally about the Time the Affair happened, she heard a Noise, and presently saw a Woman run by her in a hurry, who almost knock'd her down and run away, and after the Watch came, she heard the Man accuse that Woman in Custody, whom she believ'd to be entirely innocent.</p>
            <p>This Story we thought would do, especially as being Strangers to the Woman, could have no Interest in saying so: And if that did not do, I was afterwards to come in myself, and second her Story. This Stratagem had the desir'd Effect, for the Woman having a good Character, and the Man being drunk at the same Time, the Justice discharged her upon that, and what we said.</p>
            <p>I chuse not to tire the Readers Patience with any more of these Scenes, being most of them done in the same Manner.</p>
            <p>Some few Weeks after this, I happen'd to have some Words with Sally, and we seperated, happy was it for her! for not long after I was taken up for this unhappy Affair, for which I must suffer a shameful, ignominious Death. Tho' I die innocent thereof, (if the Reader may believe her) I have deserved Death several Times for my illegal Practices.</p>
            <p>I hope this will be a Warning to her, and may my dismal Downfal be a Means of her Repentance; for with Shame and Confusion of Face I speak it, I never thought myself more happy, than when I was do</p>

            <p>ing some illegal Action. Oh! may all unhappy, unthinking young Women, shun the deceitful Snares of Vice, and learn from me, that a Life spent in Innocence and Virtue, with the meanest Poverty, is preferable to gaining the Indies, by Injustice, Rapine, Fraud, and Violence.</p>
            <p>The following Letter was sent some few Days before she Died, which is as follows, viz.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Lineham.</p>
            <p>I Have been several Times to see if I could get Admittance to see you before you depart this wicked World; but I cannot prevail with the Person who opens the Door of the Press-Yard; indeed I cannot take it amiss of him, he being oblig'd to obey his Orders. I therefore take this Opportunity to admonish you by Letter, as far as my poor Capacity.</p>
            <p>I beg and desire of you to seek your Comfort from Almighty God, for 'tis he alone can Right you; bare up under your Load of Misfortunes, for we have a merciful God, if we return with sincere Repentance, he will forgive our former Sins.</p>
            <p>Therefore the few precious Moments you have, I beg of you for Christ Jesus Sake loose not a Moment of those few Hours which you have to live, but be continually on your Knees in your dismal and dark Cell, where you now lie confin'd 'till the fatal Day of your Exit calls you off it, to go to the Place of Execution, calling to God to have Mercy on your poor Soul; which Pray God send he may. Lord have Mercy on you, Christ have Mercy on you; which is the sincere and hearty Prayers of,</p>

Consider, you " are in a few Days launching into a " long Eternity.

            <p>I Am sorry to take Pen in Hand to write to you in such great Calamities, my Heart is overwhelmed with Grief, even to think of your unfathom'd Troubles. But my Dear Friend, the chief Design of my Writing is, to beg of you that you would make your Peace with that God whom you have so often offended. For if he should be Extreme, to mark what is done amiss who may abide it. But there is Mercy with thee good Lord, that thou may'st be fear'd, God has promised Forgiveness upon a true and unfeign'd Repentance to the worst of Sinners. Jesus Christ died for Sinners, he did not die for them that think that they had Righteousness enough of their own. I hope my dear Friend, you are convinced you are not able to stand in the Final Day of Retri</p>

I Pray God that you may see yourself to be Poor and Miserable, and Blind and Naked; that you may be convinced of the Necessity of a dying Saviour, who suffer'd that most ignominious, that shameful, that painful Death of the Cross for us poor miserable Sinners.</p>
            <p>My dear Friend, consider how short your Time is, you to all Appearance at Present, have but a few Moments before you will be divested of this Earthly Tabernacle. God grant you may be fitted and prepared to entertain the Summons of Death with Joy and Felicity, and be made to triumph in a glorious Immortality. May the Lord grant that before you leave this World, you may be enabled to cry out, the Lord Jesus is made unto me Wisdom and Righteousness, and Sanctification and Redemption; may God of his infinite Mercy grant you may cry out by Faith, as did the Penitent Thief, upon the Cross. Lord have Mercy on me, when thou comest into thy Kingdom. The Lord grant that this comfortable Answer may be made to speak Peace to thy Soul, as it was to the Penitent, this Day shalt thou be with me in Paradice. May the Lord grant that you may be qualified to praise him to all Eternity, crying, Holy! Holy! Holy! Lord God Almighty, which was and is to come. Which is the hearty Prayer of</p>
