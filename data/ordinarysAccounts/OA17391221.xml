Harwood</persName>, having been convicted of Murder, I endeavour'd to make them throughly sensible of their heinous Crimes, and inform'd them, that their Offences were irrepairable, and all their Tears, all their Sorrow and Contrition, could not make any Amends for the Facts they had committed; nor was it in their Power to recall or restore those Lives, they had wickedly destroy'd in defiance of the Almighty God, who so solemnly and awfully has declar'd Himself to be the Lord of Life and Death, who alone kills, and makes alive. And the heinousness of their Sin was represented to them, that they had destroyed the Image of God, and as every Sin deserves God's Wrath and Curse both in this Life, and that which is to come, so undoubtedly they richly deserved to be destroyed for ever, having done what in them lies to destroy the sacred Image of God fixed upon Man; and here I took Occasion to represent to them, that their Offences were particularly aggravated, by their having unnaturally destroyed the Lives of those, whom Nature, Reason and Religion, call'd on them to cherish, support and defend. Having thus endeavour'd to awaken in their Minds a deep Sense of their Guilt, they were advised sincerely to repent, not only of this Crime, but of all those Passions, and sinful Perturbations of Soul, which had urg'd them on the Commission of their Crimes. I urged them to call upon God for Pardon, and humbly to plead the Blood of Jesus, which speaks better Things than that of Abel.</p>
            <p>The others having been Thieves and Robbers, the heinous Nature of those Sins was represented to them, and they were instructed in the Obligations they were under from their baptismal Vows and Engagements, which they had broken in innumerable Instances, through the whole Course of their Lives; wherefore, since our blessed Saviour had, out of his infinite Goodness, before he left this World, instituted another Sacrament, wherein we solemnly renew our baptismal Vows. I instructed them in the Nature of this Sacrament, in which Christ's Love is communicated to true believers, and all the Blessing of the new Covenant are ensured and sealed over to all the faithful Followers and Disciples of the Holy Jesus, and they were directed how to prepare and dispose themselves for this holy Ordinance.</p>

He liv'd indifferently well with his Wife and Family for some Years, but being inclined to Drink and bad Company, and his Wife being no Oeconomist, frequent Uneasinesses arose between them, and she gave hersel up to Drinking, which occasion'd him still to become a worse Husband than before; at last this Woman who was his first Wife died, and left him a Widower, in which State he did not continue long, but got acquainted with a Widow who sold Greens, and kept a little Shop in the Neighbourhood: After they had liv'd above a Year together privately, she importun'd him to marry her, which after many Denials he consented to, and they liv'd together three Years a miserable Life, being always at Variance, tho' both of them wanted for nothing, being in a good Way of Business. As for the Murder of his Wife for which he died, he could not deny the Fact, but said his Daughter-in-law had not given an exact Account of it: He own'd he had beat and abus'd his Wife in a most unmerciful manner, because she reproved him for neglecting his Business, and for his extravagant drinking and idling away his Time in bad Company.</p>

In short, the whole Time they were marry'd, was nothing but a continued Series of Barbarity. He was a profane, wicked, irreligious, ignorant Creature, having never been within a Church since he was a Boy, pretending for an Excuse, that he wrought in the Garden on Sundays, to prepare for the Market on Monday Morning; I reproved him for his scandalous and wicked Life, exhorting him to Repentance. He behaved quietly, attended constantly in Chapel, but was miserably poor and naked: He liv'd 23 Years with his first Wife, and with this last (whom he murthered) but about two Years, of, whom he said, that she was many Years older than he, tho' too good for him. He wept often in his Cell when alone by himself, and hoped to obtain Mercy of God through Christ.</p>

He at first, deny'd the Fact he dy'd for, but afterwards confess'd the Robbery with some little variation from the Account the Witnesses gave of it: He was so wicked as to endeavour to ruin his Father in his Way of Business, who is an ingenious, industrious old Man, but most unfortunate in profligate Children. Upon the Monday the 12th of November, he was very unruly, curst and swore prodigiously, and threaten'd to murder some of the Keepers, for which his Irons were doubled; but upon his repentance and submission, the double Iron was taken off. Before his Execution, he profest a deep Penitence, and hoped to die a good Christian. He acknowledg'd that he was a very profligate, debauched Youth, and suffered deservedly.</p>

In this Manner we liv'd about a Year, and then she began to take too much upon her, and threatened to turn me out of the House.

            <p>Whatever People may insinuate concerning my deceased Wife, I must own, that she was not addicted to Drinking, nor did she use to drink any Thing more than a Pint of good Beer twice a Day. She was a very industrious Pains-taking Woman, but had a most provoking Tongue, which she frequently made Use of in an outragious Manner, tho' I did all I could to please her, for her Daughter telling me she did not like her Service, I told her she might come Home and live with us, and I set her up with Five Shillings to buy Spirituous Liquors, which she sold in our House, and had the Profit to herself; but when she was once got in, I could not get her out again, and both she and my Wife thriv'd much upon it, for they after this could buy themselves fine Stockings and Shoes, while I was content with a Pair of Hole that which cost a Groat. But this I must say for them, that they would be content with a Bit of Bread and Cheese all Day together, that they might have a Bit of something hot against I come Home at Night from Work.</p>
            <p>The Witnesses upon my Trial gave an Account of my Wife's having had me before her Death to a Justice of Peace, it was never but once, and it was upon this Occasion. She was standing before the Fire, and was saucy; I put my Foot behind her, and push'd her down in the Fire, and so she burnt her Arm; for this she had me before Mr. Justice Jones, and he asked her if she was willing to make up the Matter with me? She said, Yes; upon which the Justice advised me to go Home, and live well with her; so he discharged me, and we came Home together, and I drank two or three Pots of Beer with her and the Neighbours who went with her, by Way of Reconciliation, and we agreed to be good Friends together. This was but two or three Months before her Death.</p>

Accordingly I ran over, and caught my Dame with the Beer in her Hand, just going to clap it to her Mouth; I struck at her to throw it down, and happened to catch hold of her Arm, which she had broke the Tuesday before (no longer ago) by a Fall at the Waterside as she was picking up Chips for Firing. She cry'd out, but I threw down the Beer notwithstanding her Out-cry, and then I went over to the Alehouse again, and my Dame went to the Doctor's to have her Arm set again. After this she grew pretty well again, and came up to our Garden for Half a Sieve of Cherries. One of our Men asked her how her Arm did? She told him it was better, and that she could stir her Fingers now. But on the Day after, she said, she was not well, and took her Bed, and the Day following she was very bad indeed, and sent for me from the Garden, and I asked her, if she had any Thing to lay to my Charge? She shook her Head, and said, - She would forgive me if the World would. The next Night she died, and in the Morning. I went to bespeak a Coffin for her; my Brother was with me, and would had me have ordered a Deal Coffin, but I bespoke an Elm one, and went away to my Work.</p>
            <p>At Night, when I came Home, I found there was no Sand in the Shop, if Customers had come for any, so I went out to get some, and when I returned, I was taken by two or three Men, with a Warrant from Justice Jones, who carried me to the <placeName id="OA17391221-geo-78">

I was afterwards examined by the Justice, and there the Witnesses against me gave an Account that I had frequently abused her, and turned her out into the Street. Indeed I have often told her of her Pedigree in the Street, and that she was an old Whore, and had been my Whore before I married her; for when I was in a Passion, I car'd not who heard he.</p>
            <p>I never (I am sure) spent a Penny a Week, but what I brought Home and spent in the Neighbourhood. She was an old Slave, - that she was, and she used to get up betimes in the Morning, to go to Market, and always left me out a Dram to drink before I went out to Work. I don't know that ever I struck her with my Hands in my Life, but I have often thrown Things at her, because when I wanted to go out, she would hold the Door, and tell me, - If I killed her, I should not go out.</p>

            <p>To Mr. Joines, Prisoner in Newgate.</p>
            <p>London, Sept. 7, 1739.</p>
            <p>Unfortunate Man!</p>
            <p>" BEING inform'd that you was sentenced " to die, by the Laws of Humane Justice, " emboldened me, tho' a Stranger to you, from " that Principle of Love I bear to your Soul, to " write you this Epistle, which contains my best " Advice to you, with regard to your future Happiness; I then earnestly desire of you, as you</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173912210013"/>
            <p>" tender your Souls Good, to defer no longer the " making your Peace with the Almighty, whom " you have in a great Measure offended, by the " barbarous Murder of your Wife, and for which " Murder as aforesaid, you have stood arraigned " before the Bar of an earthly Judge, from whose " Mouth you have receiv'd Sentence, that you " shall die a shameful and ignominious Death; I " would not have you to be afraid of this Death, " for our Saviour desires us not to be afraid of " them that kill the Body, and after that has no " more Power; but says he, be afraid of him, " who after he hath killed the Body, hath Power " to cast Soul and Body into Hell Fire; I say fear " him. By all appearance the Time of your " Departure hence to be no more seen in this " World draweth nigh, therefore be busy with " the Almighty, that he would be pleased to " draw nearer and nearer to your Soul with the " Eyes of Mercy; and as you are drawing nearer " and nearer to your latter End, pray earnestly " that he would look upon you in and through " Christ, acknowledge your Sins to God, which " if you do in Sincerity, be assured that God will " accept of you, and will cast all your Sins behind " his Back: Be no longer like Martha, cumbered about many Things, while the one Thing " needful is wanting, but earnestly strive while it " is to Day, for the better Part which will never " be taken away.</p>
            <p>" Know Mr. Joines, that it is your greatest " Concern, whether Death or Life be the Event, " to be busy while it is to Day, in making your " Calling and Election sure, for the Time is fast " approaching, when all the Opportunities and " Advantages of doing God, or your Soul Service " will be hid from your Eyes, and that for ever " and ever. Do not defer your Souls Concern " till To-morrow, for you do not know what a " Day may bring forth, you do not know but " God may call you by Death, before the Time " that human Justice can be put in Execution upon you; therefore let every Moment of your " Time here in this troublesome World, be spent " in doing the Will of your heavenly Father, " and thereby you establish your Faith on a sure " Foundation, Jesus Christ the Rock of Angels.</p>
            <p>" Be not terrified at the Thoughts of Death's " nigh Approach, if you be a true Believer in " Christ, you have got the Victory over Death " and the Grave, you will be able to sing that " Triumphant Song when Death has approached " you nigher; Oh! Death where is thy Sting! Oh! " Grave where is thy Victory! Seriously meditate " on the Sufferings of Jesus Christ, who knew " no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth; " yet he was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted " with Grief; he was persecuted from his Cradle " to his Grave; then lay to Heart for whose Sake " it was, and you shall find that it was to free the " World of Sin, to save Sinners from Wrath and " Condemnation.</p>
            <p>" I do sincerely wish that your Soul may be " found Holy and acceptable in his Sight in the " Day of the Lord. I had wrote more, but designing (if God willing) to see you myself " shortly: I therefore conclude with this Wish, " that the Peace of God which passeth all Understanding, may keep your Soul and Body until " he be pleased to call you hence to be no more, " and then to receive you into his eternal Rest, " is the earnest Desire of him, who tho' a Stranger, is a well Wisher to your Soul.</p>

He lived under the Tuition of his Parents till he was about 14 Years of Age, and by that Time had acquired a competent Knowledge of the Classicks, and some Skill in the Greek Tongue. To these Acquirements his future Application added the Knowledge of several modern Languages, as French, Italian, &amp;c. His Genius was naturally turned to every Branch of polite Literature, of which his easy judicious Conversation, and beautiful Compositions, both in Verse and Prose, were evident Proofs.</p>
            <p>In his 14th Year he was sent to <placeName id="OA17391221-geo-83">
                  <interp inst="OA17391221-geo-83" type="type" value="urban_centre"/>

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173912210014"/>
            <p>He was accordingly (in a little Time) employed by one Mr. L - s, who serv'd his Clerkship with Mr. H - l; the Time he continu'd with Mr. L - s he behaved with the utmost Sobriety, Diligence, and Integrity. So great was the Esteem of his Friends for him, and the Confidence they reposed in him, that he was often employ'd by one Mr. L - s in Matters of the highest Consequence, and entrusted with very large Sums of Money, wherein he not only prov'd his Judgment and Application, but his Impartiality, Candour, and Integrity. In this Scene of Life he continued till some Affairs of Moment called Mr. L - s into Wales, where he remained for some Time, in whose Absence Mr. Barkwith was left to get the Rents of his Estate in Fetter-Lane.</p>
            <p>And now comes on the Era of all his Misfortunes. He had for some Time retain'd a very great Affection for a young Gentlewoman, who liv'd in the same Neighbourhood. The Restraint he was under in his Master's Presence, and his necessary Attention to Business, did not permit him to make his Addresses for some Time; and it was not till after his Master's Departure, that he gave himself entirely up to the Dictates of his blind Passion: But not being under such Restrictions as he was before, every Consideration was sacrificed that did not suit with his Affection for the young Gentlewoman. All his Time, his Thoughts, &amp;c. were employ'd in Devotion to her; who in an artful, but an insincere Manner, receiv'd and countenanc'd his Addresses. Balls, Plays, and Assemblies, in Complaisance to her Vanity and Levity, he began daily to frequent, and every Extravagance was entered into, that could oblige or amuse her.</p>
            <p>So great was his Infatuation in regard to this young Lady, that he was never easy but in her Presence; nor could her repeated Insults to him cool his Affection, but on the contrary, they only served to heighten his Passion for her. As she had no Fortune of her own, she began to throw all her Dependance upon him, and he often made her considerable Presents, and ran such Lengths to support her Pride and Extravagance, as plung'd him into insuperable Difficulties, and pav'd the Way to his Ruin.</p>
            <p>His Master, upon his Return, found his Affairs in a very odd Posture, contrary to his former Experience of Mr. Barkwith's Conduct and Assiduity. The Cause was immediately enquired into, and it appeared, that the unhappy Amour before mentioned, was the Source of every Part of his ill Conduct. His Master, apprehending Things were grown too desperate to admit of a Cure, with a good deal of Reluctance dismissed him, tho' he ceased not, upon all Occasions, to shew him particular Marks of his Esteem. Mr. Barkwith upon this took Chambers of his own, and began to practice a little for himself; but as he never was regularly admitted an Attorney, so all his Transactions ran in his Master's Name. In this Situation he continu'd about six Months, and in all Probability might have retrieved himself, had not his Passion for the young Gentlewoman diverted his Mind from Business, and betray'd him into greater Extravagancies. About the Middle of September last he was arrested for a Debt of 10 l. to which he put in Bail, and afterwards paid the same.</p>
            <p>This Accident taking Air, began to alarm his Creditors, and gave them an unfavourable Opinion of his Circumstances. Their Demands upon him now encreased daily, and indeed much faster than was in his Power to satisfy. He made Application to some Friends for their Assistance, but (as is too generally the Case in Adversity) he met with very little Help from them. Those Persons to whom he had formerly reached out the Hand of Friendship in a liberal Manner, were now the last to offer him their Assistance, and seem'd insensible of his Distress.</p>
            <p>These Difficulties almost distracted him, not that he felt so much Uneasiness for himself, as for his being incapable my longer to sooth the Vanity, and support the Extravagance of the young Lady. To repair these shatter'd Circumstances, he had Recourse to the worst of all Expedients. On Tuesday the 13th of November, in the Morning, he rode out of Town, under Pretence of going to Denham, in the County of Bucks, where (as he since declar'd) he had an Affair of Consequence to settle in regard to an Estate belonging to, or late in the Possession of one Miss P - l. Whether Business of this Kind called him to Denham, or not, is very uncertain; but be that as it will, about 4 o'Clock the same Day in the Afternoon, he attacked <persName id="OA17391221n93-1">

            <p>Twelve Shillings, viz. four Half Crowns and two Shillings, riding off in a very civil Manner, without offering any Violence whatever.</p>
            <p>Within a few Minutes after the Robbery, a Gentleman behind upon the Road (who had observed the Chariot to stop, &amp;c.) came up, to whom the Coachman addressed himself, saying, We have just been robb'd, yonder goes the Man, pointing forward towards Mr. Barkwith, who was yet upon the Road within View. Hereupon the Gentleman pursued him, but being unarm'd and alone, he struck off to the next House in View, and there supplying himself with proper Fire-Arms, and engaging a Servant to assist him, he renew'd the Pursuit, and in less than a Quarter of an Hour came up to Mr. Barkwith again, there being only a Hedge betwixt them. They held forth a Musket, and bid him surrender, or he was a dead Man. This so amaz'd him, that without making any Reply, he put Spurs to his Horse, and rode off with the utmost Expedition. His Pursuers quickly lost Sight of him, and had he not alighted to take up his Hat, which the Wind blew off, 'tis very probable he would have escap'd 'em, but that Accident gave them Time to come up with him again; when finding himself closely pursu'd, he quitted his Horse and struck off into the Fields, where being in great Disorder and Confusion, and pretty much fatigu'd, he threw off his Great Coat, which being observed by some Labourers, they suspected him, and accordingly made up to him; he thereupon took out a Pistol, and snapp'd it at his own Head, but that missing Fire, he took out a second, and repeated the Attempt; but as they happened to be unprim'd, no Hurt ensu'd. Hereupon he surrendered, acknowledging he had that Afternoon robbed a Gentleman on <placeName id="OA17391221-geo-85">

            <p>He made pressing Instances for his Liberty, and large Promises in Regard to his future Conduct, &amp;c. He was detain'd in Custody that Night, and on the Morrow was examined before Justice Tash, of Drayton in the County of Middlesex, who gave Orders for his being brought to <placeName id="OA17391221-geo-86">

He was accordingly brought before Justice Deveil, who, upon the Depositions of the Witnesses against him, committed him to Newgate. His Behaviour before his Trial was in all Respects modest and discreet; he seem'd to have a proper Sense of his Misfortune, tho' not those melancholly Apprehensions common to guilty Minds.</p>
            <p>The following is the Copy of a Letter, which he sent sometime before his Trial to the young Lady.</p>
            <p>Dear Miss,</p>
            <p>YOU cannot be unacquainted with my Commitment to this miserable Place, nor with the melancholly Circumstances that preceded it; but the gloomy Situation of my Soul, I am persuaded you are in a great Measure a Stranger to. 'Tis beyond the Power of Language to express the deep</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173912210016"/>
            <p>Anguish that preys upon my Spirits, and the insuperable Grief of my Heart. With Regard to myself my Concern is nothing, but what I feel for you, racks me with a thousand Tortures. 'Tis not the Reproach of the World, 'tis not Death in all its Terrors that dismays me, but to forfeit your dear Esteem, to be torn from your dear Presence, is a Thought to the last Degree insupportable.</p>
            <p>Tho' I have had some Reason to doubt your Fidelity, yet I cannot question your Concern for the Misfortune I am now plung'd into; but though you should totally reject and disregard me, yet will you ever possess the first Place in my Thoughts, and remain the eternal Mistress of my Affections.</p>
            <p>With respect to the Fact I am charged with, there can no certain Proof be brought against me. The Gentleman robbed swears that he believes I am not the Man, and his Coachman has sworn positively that I am not; so that I am not without Hopes of being acquitted; but should it happen otherwise, and the impending Ruin fall upon me, I must conjure you by all our former Endearments, to pay me a Visit, and let me once more embrace you, and bid you a long Farewel, before I plunge into Eternity.</p>
            <p>I am, dearest Creature, Your most affectionate, Most inviolable, But unworthy Servant,</p>

            <p>To all young Men in general, more especially those of the City of London.</p>
            <p>Country-men and Friends,</p>
            <p>YOU either have been, or by this Paper will be inform'd, of the Ruin I am plung'd into. In order to set my unhappy Circumstances in a true Light, and thereby prevent any false Accounts from being divulg'd, I have myself put Pen to Paper, and hope that what I have now to offer, will meet with your Attention. My Education, and Conduct in Life, the World (I apprehend) has been appriz'd of: With regard to the former, I have only to say, that it was not inconsistent with the Profession I afterwards engag'd in (viz.) the Law, nor in the least below the Character of a Gentleman. In respect to my general Behaviour since I appear'd in publick Life, I shall make the following Observations. About the Age of Fourteen, I wrote for one Mr. L - s, a worthy Gentleman an Attorney, with whom I had wrote for some Time; and during that Time, acquir'd an universal good Character, and was esteem'd by my Friends in general, as a Person of great Sobriety and unsully'd Integrity. About two Years since, I unhappily plac'd my Affections on a young Lady; my Passion was so violent and sincere for her, that all my Attention to Business was entirely confounded by it, and I was utterly incapable of enjoying any Satisfaction out of her Presence. The Consequence of all this, was the total Neglect of my Business at Home, and all kind of Extrava</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173912210017"/>
            <p>gance Abroad; a Discharge from the Service of my Master, and a general Disesteem of my former Friends and Acquaintance. Thus discarded, and driven to Extremity, what Course could I take? or what Asylum could I fly to? I saw nothing but Distress behind me, and a melancholy Scene of Incertainty before me. 'Twas wholly out of my Power to gratify the Gaiety of the young Gentlewoman of my Affections or to support the Figure I once made in Life. These Circumstances appeared to me in a most shocking Light, and I could not bear the Thought of forfeiting the dear Esteem of the young Lady, nor of being publickly reduc'd to Extremity. Hereupon I precipitately and inconsiderately rush'd upon the unfortunate Attempt, for which I am now sentenc'd to die. Heaven itself can witness for me, that I never had the least Intention of depriving any Man, of his Property, 'till invincible Necessity surrounded me, and that I then attempted it with the utmost Reluctance. My Fate is now irrevocable, and I have only to implore the Divine Being for the Pardo of my Sins, and his gracious Support under my approaching Trial. I hope the Consideration of my wretched Fate will have some Influence upon your Minds, and be a Means of detering you from engaging in the like Measures. The Folly, Extravagance, and Luxury of young Gentlemen at this Time, especially of those about the Inns of Court, is but too notorious: Would they take warning by my Example, they would undoubtedly prevent those shocking Evils that are the sure Attendants upon Extravagance and Debauchery. Let them in the full Career of their Pleasures, reflect upon me. I have enjoy'd all the mad Delights the World could supply me with, have exhausted my Patrimony, impair'd my Health, and embarrass'd my Circumstances, in the Pursuit of Pleasure, and the Gratification of the Passions; the Consequence of which Conduct and Indulgence, (with bitterness of Soul I speak it) is my inevitable Destruction. Dear Friends, let Moderation and Temperance guide you in pursuit of Pleasure, acquiesce in the Dispensations of Providence, rest satisfy'd with the Portion that Heaven has bless'd you with, and be scrupulously tender of every Man's Property. I am now upon the Point of bidding an eternal Adieu to the World, and what I speak is, from the very bottom of my Soul, and from the clear Ideas I have of the Beauty and Excellence of Virtue and Sobriety, and the pernicious Result of Vice and Immorality. Finally, my Brethren, whatsoever Things are honest, whatsoever Things are just, whatsoever Things are lovely, whatsoever Things are of good Report, if there be any Praise, if there be any Honour, think on these Things.</p>

            <p>Who'd crawl a Reptile in this Maze of Strife,</p>
            <p>When Death is but an Entrance into Life?</p>
            <p>A quick Transition from this dreary Strand,</p>
            <p>To the Elysium of the promis'd Land;</p>
            <p>Where Light ineffable for ever glows;</p>
            <p>Where Joy resides, and endless Pleasure flows.</p>
            <p>Hush then my Soul, be chearful and resign'd,</p>
            <p>Nor tremble at the gloomy Scene behind.</p>
            <p>Death is a Debt we all to Nature owe,</p>
            <p>Severe to none, but those who think it so.</p>
            <p>Eternal God! thy gracious Aid impart,</p>
            <p>Enlarge my Mind, and fortify my Heart,</p>
            <p>My Soul enlighten with thy Sacred Truth,</p>
            <p>And purge me from the Crimson guilt of Youth.</p>
            <p>Receive me to the Bosom of thy Love,</p>
            <p>And let me live Eternally ABOVE.</p>

            <p>THIS with my Duty to you, hoping you are Well; give my Love to my Uncle Richard, and his Wife, and hope they will come and see me, in the deplorable Condition I am in; I hope the Lord will hear my Cry, and prepare my Soul, for Death is at Hand, Lord have Mercy on my poor Soul, Christ have Mercy upon me; for the Lord's Sake Grandfather pray for my poor Soul, for I fear I am for ever undone, for I have been a very wicked Sinner, and have but a short Time to live to repent of my Sins, for which my Heart is ready to break, for I fear that my Soul will be for ever in Misery. Therefore, for the Lord's Sake, make Friends to some Gentlemen to save my Life if you can, if not, pray for my Soul for the Lord's Sake, for I shall die on Friday next; pray send some body to ake my Body from the Surgeons; Lord receive my Soul for Christ's Sake; pray send me a Rugg to cover me with, for I lye on the bare Boards, and the Cells are so dark, that we are obliged to burn Candles Day and Night, and we are allowed nothing but Bread and Water; dear Grandfather, for the Lord's Sake, and my Soul's Sake, get some noble Gentlemen to petition the King for my Life. Pray send me a Book to read in, for I am at a great Loss for want of it, to put me in the Way to pray for my poor distressed Soul; let all my Cousins take Warning by me for the Lord's Sake, and keep themselves from bad Company, especially from Women, for it was that brought me to this shameful Death, which I heartily repent, though too late I fear; pray send somebody to see me, as long as I live, and pray dear Grandmother come to see me before I dye, for I want to speak with you; pray send me a Psalm Book.</p>

            <p>Dear Brother, as this is the last I shall trouble you with, I hope you will send up some Money for my Burial. A very good Friend of mine has been at vast Expences for me since my Confinement, he has it not in his Power to bury me, otherwise I should not have troubled you.</p>
            <p>I am sorry as well on your Account as my own, to have Occasion to trouble you on so dismal a Subject. I am now in a bad State of Health, and would rather die than live.

            <p>The Second Edition, with Additions,</p>
            <p>A DESCRIPTION of the WINDWARD-PASSAGE, and Gulf of FLORIDA, with the Course of the British Trading-Ships to, and from the Island of Jamaica. Also an Account of the TRADE-WINDS and CURRENTS thereabouts, at different Seasons of the Year. Illustrated with a CHART of the Coast of Florida, and of the Islands of the Bahama, Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and the adjacent smaller Islands, Shoals, Rocks, and other remarkable Things in the Course of the Navigation in the West-Indies. Whereby is demonstrated, the Precariousness of those Voyages to the West-India Merchants, and the Impossibility of their Homeward-bound Ships keeping clear of the Spanish Guarda Costa's. The Whole very necessary for the Information of such as never were in those Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>To which are added, some PROPOSALS for the better securing of the British Trade and Navigation to and from the West Indies.</p>
            <p>Note, At the End of this Treatise is a General INDEX of the Names, with a Description of the Situations of the Islands, &amp;c. contained in the annex'd Chart, distinguished by Numerical References to each other. Likewise an Alphabetical Catalogue of the same Names alone, with the like Numerical References, the Uses of which are mentionned at the End of the Whole.</p>
            <p>To which is now annexed, a very remarkable Letter, containing a succinct Account of the Galleons, Flota, Flotilla, and Register-ships; as also of the Ports of Havana, Porto-Bello, Carthagena, Vera-Cruz, Buenos-Ayres, and the Coasts of the Carrcca's; iterspers'd with various curious Remarks on the Commerce of the Spaniards in America.</p>
