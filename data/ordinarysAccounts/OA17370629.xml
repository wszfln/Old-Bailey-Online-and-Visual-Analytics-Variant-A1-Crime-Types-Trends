            <p>While under Sentence, They were taught, That the Benefits Christ hath purchased for us are such as will undoubtedly make the Soul happy; one of which Benefits is, Eternal Life; but to these we can have no Claim or Title until we perform the Conditions required by the Gospel, which in general are, An hearty and honest Endeavour to fulfill the whole Will of God, a fervent Desire, that the same Mind may be in us, which was in Christ Jesus, who was sent into the World to make the clearest Revelation of those Things, wherein our Happiness both here and hereafter consisted. For though some Principles seem to be innate, and to be engraven on the Mind; yet without this Revelation by Jesus Christ our Knowledge would have been very imperfect- for Life and Immortality, and the Forgiveness of our Sins by Christ, are brought to Light, only by the Gospel. By this Revelation the eternal Beauty of Vertue and Holiness is set in a clear Light. By this we are taught, that the wise Creator of our Beings has implanted a Principle within us, which will ever approve of our Actions when they are consistent with Vertue, and will always condemn us, when we engage in Courses of Vice.</p>
            <p>St. Paul saith, Rom. ii. 15. Mens Consciences do in these Things accuse or excuse them; they tell them, whether they have done what they have done in these Particulars, or not. Christ having brought greater Light into the World, never meant to extinguish that lesser Light, which God had set up in their Souls; Therefore we ought not to venture on any of those Acts, which meer natural Conscience convinceth us to be sinful. Whence we observ'd to them, That it is just Matter of Sadness, to see some who profess much Religion, living in such Sins, as a meer Heathen would abhor; and that it ought to be laid as a Foundation, That no Relation or Opinion can be of God, which allows Men in any Wickedness. The Sum of their Duty I shew'd them, to be briefly comprehended in this, Tit. ii. 12 That we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World; soberly, containing our duty to our selves; righteously, our duty to our Neighbour; and godly, our duty to God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Three of them having been convicted of that most horrible of all Crimes, Murther, I represented to them the Heinousness of this very great Sin; as it appear'd from the first Act of this kind ever was committed, Abel's Blood cried from the Earth, as God tells Cain, Gen. iv. 10. yea the Guilt of this Sin is so great, that it leaves a stain upon the Land where it is committed, such as cannot be wiped out but by the Blood of the Murderer, Deut. xix. 12, 13. tho' in other Cases, flying to the Altar secured a Man, yet here was no city of Refuge allow'd, Exod. xxi. 14. Thou shalt take him from my altar, that he may die. And it's observable, that there are only two Precepts mention'd, as given to Noah after the Flood, one, not to eat blood, to excite in us an abhorrence of this Sin, Gen. ix. 4. the other, for the Punishment of it, Gen. ix. 6. He that sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173706290004"/>
            <p>be shed; and the Reason is added, For in the image of God made he man; whence we see, that this Sin is not only an irreparable Injury to our Brother, but 'tis putting even the highest Contempt on, and doing despite to God himself; for it is the defacing of his image, which he stamped upon Man. <persName id="OA17370629n17-1">

Upon Tuesday the 3d of May, her Brother came to visit her, but she abus'd him, calling him Scoundrel Black-guard Dog, murthering Dog, and many other Names. During her Confinement she used to sing obscene Songs, and talked very indecently: For this I reproved her sharply, showing the great Danger her Soul was in of everlasting Damnation; she behav'd after this with more seeming Decency than formerly, but never could be brought to any Knowledge of Religion, and she forgot every Thing that was told her in Publick or Private; she was one of the most sottish, wicked, stupid Creatures that ever I saw under the like Misfortunes.</p>

He had not been so wicked in his Life as many such notorious Malefactors; he had not altogether neglected Religious Duties, but had liv'd pretty regularly: The Business he was bred to being very hard Work, prov'd Occasion of his drinking sometimes to very great Excess, and then he was very quarrelsome, tho' at other Times of a peaceable Disposition.

Bosworway could not deny this, only he alledged, that he met with Provocation, by being dragg'd thro' the Room, and awak'd out of his Sleep in a Fright, tho' the contrary appears by the Evidence. The Deceased languish'd for 17 or 18 Days in a miserable Condition, never having fully recover'd his Senses, for his Brains was seen thro' the Wound, and then he died. Bosworway only endeavour'd to extenuate his Guilt. I represented to him the Barbarity and Cruelty of the Act: He had nothing farther to say in his Vindication, but cried and wept bitterly, and own'd his heinous Sins, and that he suffer'd deservedly. Tho' he had not been so irregular as many others, yet he lamented that he had been so much addicted to the Sin of Drunkenness. He behav'd well under his Misfortunes, was Penitent for the many Sins of his Life, and hoped for Salvation thro' the Mercy of God in Christ; dying in Peace with all the World.</p>

He first brought him acquainted with this Woman, and his shameful End is in a great Measure owing to his Contracting this unhappy Acquaintance, by which he was drawn into unreasonable and vicious Expences; the Consequence of which was,-Advice from his dear Companion and intimate Friend, to rob his Master, which ('twas represented to him) would be no difficult Thing as he so perfectly knew the House. His Attachment to these Wretches, strengthned the Temptation, and he resolved to make the Attempt, in which he was fortunately discover'd**, else he had got a Booty of 800 or 900 l.

And accordingly, knowing the House perfectly well and where the Booty lay, he put his Design into Execution the following Night, and by wrenching out a Bar of the Cellar Window, he got into the House, and seiz'd the desired Prey; but loitering about the House 'till between 6 and 7 in the Morning, his Escape was prevented by the People of the House, who finding the Cellar-Window broke, and the Box of Money missing, immediately search</p>

            <p>APPENDIX.</p>
            <p>IT is a melancholy Observation, that notwithstanding such frequent Examples are made of Offenders; nevertheless so many fall by the Hand of publick Justice, and are punish'd for their Vices, in the Loss of their Lives, yet such is the Prevalence of evil Custom, and so strong the Force of wicked Habits, that the most shocking Instances of Distress and Anguish, are not sufficient to deter from Courses, which must necessarily conclude in Horror and Destruction.</p>
            <p>Too many Proofs of the Depravity and Degeneracy of human Nature, are generally given in these Accounts; and though the fatal</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173706290011"/>
            <p>rocks are so plainly pointed out, on which Multitudes of unfortunate, thoughtless Creatures have been ship-wreck'd, yet such is the Condition of a Mind in Love with, and enur'd to Vice, that even the most firm Expectation of Shame and Ruin, is not attended with any good Effect.</p>
            <p>'Tis worth remarking, that when these inconsiderate Wretches have brought themselves to a fatal Necessity of reaping the Fruit of their vicious Labour, their greatest Concern is to extenuate their Guilt; and even in their dying Minutes, they too frequently endeavour by solemn Asseverations and mean Prevarications, to perswade the World that they are innocent, or not so shamefully wicked as has been imagined.</p>
            <p>The following Papers contain something to this Purpose, and in many of them is pictured the Distress and Horror of Mind that attends a Wretch about to suffer for having acted contrary to the eternal Laws of Vertue and right Reason.</p>

            <p>On Monday Evening, his Father came to the Door of the Press-yard, and call'd out to his Son, in the Cell, desiring him to lay aside all Thoughts of this World, and to employ his few remaining unspent Minutes in preparing for another. He advised him to pray servently to God for Mercy, and told him, he would come the next Day to take a last Farewel of him: Which he did, according to his Promise, and they embraced each other very affectionately, and their Parting was in so sorrowful and tender a Manner, that the Grief was communicated to the Spectators, and every Eye flow'd with Tears.</p>

I frequented Night-Houses, Play-houses and other Places where I met bad Company, and the Leaders on to my Ruin; which exposed me to those Expences which I was not able to bear, and to supply which, I determined to rob my Master. Before I put my Design in Execution I pawn'd all my Cloaths, and every thing else I had of any Value, and not knowing any other Way to come at any Money, I committed this Fact for which I deservedly suffer. But I desire my Relations not to reflect on my Companions, for had it not been my own Inclination to have done it, no body could have perswaded me to it, and I</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173706290013"/>

            <p>I freely forgive my Master (for prosecuting me) and every Body else in this World, hoping for Forgiveness my self in the Next.</p>
            <p>Good People. You that know my Parents, I beg you'd not reflect on them for they were always very tender over me, and gave me a good Education and good Councel, and did as much as lay in their Power for me, they being but in a Middling Station of Life.</p>
            <p>And let all take Warning by my ignominious Death, not to addict themselves to too much Company, nor engage in such Courses as shall lay them under Temptations to wrong others. So I conclude, hoping the Lord Jesus will have Mercy on my Soul, a wicked Sinner.</p>

            <p>I beg every Body that knows me, not to reflect upon my Relations, who were always very kind to me, and gave me good Counsel.</p>
            <p>I think it needless to say any more, or to give any Account of my Parentage and Education, as a great many do; for those that know me, know my Family, and those that do know me, it would be of no Signification to them; for if you wanted a great deal, I could give you a long History, but in my Opinion, this is enough to satisfy a Parcel of Rabble. So conclude, hoping to obtain Mercy from the Lord Jesus, who have been a wicked Sinner.</p>

            <p>The following PAPER Sampson wrote for his own Use during his Confinement after Condemnation.</p>
            <p>O Eternal and ever living God! thou first breathedst into Man the Breath of Life; when thou takest away that Breath he dieth, and he turns again to his Dust. Look with Compassion on me, thy poor dying Creature; I am drawing near the Gates of Death, and the House appointed for all Living: but what is infinitely more terrible, I must soon appear before thy Judgment Bar. Lord! my own Heart condemns me, and thou art infinitely greater than my Heart, and knowest all Things. The Sins that I know and remember fill me with Horror, but Lord, there are Multitudes of others which I observed not at the Time I committed them, or which I have since carelesly forgotten: these are all present to thee; thou settest my Iniquities before thee, and my secret Sins in the Light of thy Countenance. Lord! to what a Mountainous Height must the Provocations of so many Years, (and committed every Minute) arise! How shall one so ungodly stand in thy Judgment, or such a Sinner in the Congregation of thy Saints! But to add yet to my Terror, my very Repentance I fear, will not abide the Trial. My frequent Relapses heretofore, have sufficiently evidenced the Insincerity of my Resolutions; and Lord what can secure me from thy Displeasure, when even my present Dislike of my former Crimes is rather the Effect of my terrifying Danger, than the Consequence of a real Change in me. I know, O Lord, thou art not mocked, nor wilt thou accept of any Thing that is not perfectly sincere. When I consider this, Fearfulness and Trembling cometh upon me, and a horrible Dread overwhelmeth me. My Flesh trembleth for Fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgements. My Spirit is overwhelmed within me, my Heart within me is desolate, One Depth calleth unto another; the Depth of my Misery calleth upon the Depth of thy Mercy: Lord! Lord save me or I perish eternally. O thou! thou, who willest not that any should perish, but that all should come to Repentance, bring me I beseech thee, tho' thus late, to a sincere Repentance, such as thou wilt accept, thou who knowest the Heart and triest the Reins. O create in me a clean Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me. Lord one Day with thee is as a thousand Years; to thee Nothing is impossible; O let thy powerful Spirit work in me, - even in this my last Day, - whatever thou seest wanting in me, to sit me for an Object of thy Mercy and Acceptance. Give me a perfect and an intire Hatred of my Sins, and enable me to present thee with the Sacrifice of a truly broken Heart, and a contrite Spirit, which thou hast promised, thou wilt not despise. O make me capable of receiving the Benefit of that Attonement, which thy dear Son, by the most excellent Oblation of himself, has made for repenting, returning Sinners. He is the Propitiation for our Sins; He was wounded for our Transgressions; he was bruised for our Iniquities; the Chastisement of our Peace was upon him, O that by his Stripes I might be healed. Lord let the Cry of his Blood drown the Clamour of my Sins: I am indeed a Child of Wrath, but he is the Son of thy Love; O! for his Sake spare me.</p>
            <p>Lord spare me thy Creature, and let his most precious Blood redeem me: Lord be not angry with me for ever. In my Saviour's Wounds I take Sanctuary, let not thy Vengeance drive me forth from this City of Refuge. My Soul hangeth upon him, O let me not perish with a Saviour, - with a crucify'd Jesus in my Arms; but, By his Agony and bloody Sweat; By his Cross and Passion, by all that he suffer'd for Sinners Good Lord deliver me. Deliver me from the Wages of my Sins, - from thy Wrath and from that everlasting Damnation, which I have too frequently and horridly call'd down on my Head. Hear me in this the Time of my Tribulation, and in the Hour of Death deliver my Soul. Do not repay my former Neglect of thy gracious Calls to Mercy, by refusing to answer me in my sore Distress. Lord there is one Step yet between me and Death, O let not my Sun set in thy Wrath, but seal my</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173706290016"/>
            <p>Parden before I go hence and be seen  more,  loving Kindness is better than Life, O let me have but some well grounded Hope of that, and I will lay me down in Peace; I will then gladly resign this mortal Life. Lord thou knowest all my Desire and my Groaning is not hid from thee. Deal with me according to thy Mercy, and according to the Multitude of thy tender Mercies blot out all my Transgressions. Thy Mercy will be sweet to my Soul; 'twill take away the Sting of Death and the Guilt of my Sins, and then I shall walk thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and shall fear no Evil; then I shall awake and shall be satisfy'd with the beatifick Vision of thy Glory. Grant this thou merciful God, for the Sake of him who dyed for Sinners even Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>

            <p>The exact Copy of a Letter sent by Bosworway to his Friend, from his Cell in Newgate.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fauster,</p>
            <p>Sir. I have writ to you in Return of Thanks for all Favors that have been done for me by you, in delivring my Petison and going about my Affare, which has bin a grate dele of Truble to you and lose of Time, and I hope God will bless you for it, as for those hard harted Men who swore against me, I heartily forgive them, and wish they may never come to this unhappe Stasion that I am in. For what I die for, I am innocent off, any Wayes willfully, therefore I hope God will have Mercy on my Soul, for I had never any Malis or Spite against the Man that is dead in my Life, but they swore against me for the Sake of the Reward * of 40 l. which is the Prise of Blood, as Judas did by his Master Christ. In him I hop to be sav'd.</p>
            <p>I am in hope that no body will reflec on my Wife nor none of my Relasions, for they  not in Faut, nor cant help what I have done. I desire you'll go to Mr. Poregar and put him in mind, for he has promised to get a coch and som help to save my Body from the Surgeons, and I hope the rest of my Fellow-Sarvents will be ther to assist. My Mother lives in Red- Yard near Clerkenwell Green, Richard Wards Chandeler's Shop. If you'll be so good to get Mr. Lewis and Mr. Panner, and Mr. Lyeh at Pole's Wharf to be something toward a Coc with Mr. Prgar. So no more from you dying Friend.</p>

            <p>Worthy Sir,</p>
            <p>' With humbel Submission I have made  ' to trouble you in hope you will not  ' amis, but consider my languishing Condition ' and my hard Fate to lose my life for such ' unhapy Thing, for had I done that  ' Accident wilfuly, I should have thought that ' nothing but Deth had been gude enough for ' me, nor that nether, but as I did not, I ho ' God will have Mercy on my Soul, as I was ' not guilty of willfull murder, nor any thing ' relating to it. therfor dere Sir, I humble  ' of you for God's Sake to have some Compassion on me, and help to save my life, as it ' lyes in your Power so to do, if you will be so ' good for Christ's Sake, for I am innocent of ' willfuly duing the murder, and so they all ' know who swore against me. I humbly  ' you'll give a Petition to the D - of N - t ' and get him to speak for me to save my  ' for 'tis not my own life only, but it will be ' tho Death of my Mother likewise. Pray  ' Sir have some compassion on me for Christ's ' Sak, and I hope God will bless you </p>
            <p>* The Witnesses upon his Trial behaved with the greatest Decency, and seem'd to be altogether unprejudiced Persons. The Malefactors Assertion with Regard to the 40 l. is untrue, for there is no Reward at all, in such Cases.</p>

            <p>Good People,</p>
            <p>I Am willing to make some short Speech before I deport this World that the World may be satisfied, I think it very hard I should dye for a Thing I did not do willfully, but my receiving of gross Usage from the Deceased, caused me to strike him with the hammer, which unluckily happed to be his Death by hitting him on the Forehead, but as I hope for Salvation, I did not do it with an Intent to murder him, but being in Liquor and in a great Passion, took up the first thing as I could lay my Hand upon, which unfortunately happned to be the framing hammer: So I would have every Person to govern their Passion and beware of Drunkenness, which is the Forerunner of all Evil and Sin, for if I had not been drunk, this unhappy Accident had not happned, which is he Occasion of the Death of two People. It was said, it might be brought in as Manslaughter; it was found Wilful Murder, and the Evidence Montgomery, swore that the Deceased said, when he received the Blow. That the Rogue has got my Life. I think the Deceased did not lay any such Words, for he said upon his Death-bed that he freely forgive me.</p>
            <p>Which is all I have to say concerning the Deceased.</p>
            <p>Now as to my  and Education, I shall give you , which is as follows, viz.</p>
            <p>My father dying when I was young, left me with a very indulgent Mother, who took Care to put me <rs id="OA17370629-occupation-25" type="occupation">Apprentice to a Sawyer</rs>

                     targets="OA17370629n148-1 OA17370629-occupation-25"/>, with whom I serv'd very faithful, till at last he , and then I workt for my self, and always behaved my self very sober and honest, and I never wronged any Person of the Value of a Half-penny in my Life; but this unhappy Accident is the Occasion of the misfortunate End I am come to, and I freely forgive every Body in this World, as I hope Forgiveness in the next, and I forgive the Evidence particular, I beg every Body that knows me, not to reflect upon my Relations, especially my poor Mother, who has always been very tender over me. So conclude this my last Speech, hoping the Lord Jesus will have Mercy upon my poor Soul a miserable Sinner.</p>

My dear let not Excess of Grife overtake you for my unhappy Fate, as God has seen it so fit, I hope he will restore me in everlasting Happeyness. My dear when I am gone, I hope God will protect you Night and Day, and when he sees fit to call you after me, I hope your Soul will be happy for ever. I hope my dear you forgive all that is past in our Lives, freely from your Heart, as I do from mine. Prethee take Care and do not be led away, but serve God and all will go well.</p>

            <p>Dear Mother and Wife,</p>
            <p>THIS is sent to you as my last Farewell, - an eternal Adiew to a wicked and troublesome World. I never could have thought that I deserved Death, or that I ever should have suffer'd in so ignominious a Kind; but whatever Reflections a base World may make on you, you have done your Part, and whatever were my Follies of Youth, I hope God will forgive them, now I go off the Stage of Life, and satisfy for my Crimes with the last Drop of my Blood. God forgive all who have injur'd me, and send them true Repentance, as I hope he has me and all my Fellow-Sufferers; and I doubt not but God will hear the Prayers</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA173706290020"/>
            <p>of a suffering Christian. I hope and beg for God's Sake, that you (my dear Mother) will not reflect at all on my dear Wife, she new nothing or what I did, altho' her pretended Frends wou'd induced her to forsake me in my last Extremity: But her Relations are and have been cruel, cruel, very cruel to me ever since my being taken up. But I am sure I never offended them, nor any one, 'till I forged this Note, which I did not doe with any other Design but only to satisfy my Creditors 'till I could have Power to pay it, which I did design. I have cased my Conscience to Almighty God, and I hope I shall receive Remission. Remember my dying Love to all Friends, and I hope I shall be the only one of the Family that dies at the Fatal Tree. Beg of my Sister Sarah, and my Brothers and Sisters never to be ambitious, but mind and be contented in that State wherein God has placed them, and God will then be a Father to them, and give them all their Wants I hope God will pardon me, and be the Comfort of you in your old Age, and be a Son and a Husband to you, far better than I could have been, and let my dear Wife, whose short liv'd Marriage has been Nothing but Sorrow not reflect on me, God I hope will assist her and you; she is innocent, and ever was a good Wife, though I am an unhappy Husband. I hope I shall be buried, - 'tis the last O you can do for me. - before, you receive this, I shall be in endless Eternity, I hope praising God, and that I shall see both you and my Wife, and Brothers and Sisters, and all my Friends in a better State.</p>
            <p>From your once Son and Husband,</p>
