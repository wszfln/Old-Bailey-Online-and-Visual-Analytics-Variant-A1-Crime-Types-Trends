So that this Punishment he has brought upon himself by his own Obstinacy; for if Innocence had been of his Side, he might have surrendered, and made it appear, and then his Life had been safe: But the flying from Justice, he is now sensible, argued Guilt in the Eye of the Law, and, of course, Punishment must ensue. However, according to the common Usage of these People, he refused to own the Matter of the Information against him to be true; but said, as it pleased God to suffer him to be thus dealt with, he received his Fate with Resignation, forgiving all Men, as he hoped to be forgiven.</p>

            <p>His Parents had received for him the Thirty-six Pounds abovementioned; and when he left them last, he had Twenty Pounds of them, which he brought to Town, but it lasted not long among such Companions as he betook himself to. When that was gone, they taught him how to go about to get more, and he was so regardless of his own Interest, as to listento their evil Council, to the Hazard of his Life. He owned he had got into bad Company, but said he knew not their Names, nor where they belonged to: Moreover, that he had not been concerned in any Robbery, nor had his Companions committed any to his Knowledge; but loose and idle they were, and had persuaded him to become so too. And now, being reduced to very great Straits and Necessity, and a Woman, he called his Wife, being ready to lye in, which occasioned her Complaints in such Circumstances to be the more frequent and clamorous, he could think of no other Expedient to provide for her, than by Robbery and Plunder.

But, being made sensible, that taking a Handkerchief, or Ten Pounds upon the Highway, is liable to the same Punishment; he said, well, I cannot help it, if I must suffer for it here, I hope, the Lord Jesus Christ will lookupon me with Pity and Compassion, and have Mercy upon my poor Soul hereafter. At last he did own, that he had committed other Robberies, two or three, but that they were done when he was in Liquor, as, it seems, was too often the Case with him; but said, he never got much by it, and lamented himself very much, saying, that Drunkenness had been the Cause of all the Evils he had done or suffered.</p>

            <p>Watt's Body was, by his Friend's Direction, carried away in a Hearse, which attended for that Purpose.</p>
            <p>Burk's and Holly's were put into a Cart, which they had provided, and guarded away from Tyburn by a great Company of Sailors.</p>
