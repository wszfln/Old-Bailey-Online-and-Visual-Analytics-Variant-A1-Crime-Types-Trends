But now he began to think it unsafe, and to be afraid of being seen. He found it impossible to get any Livelihood in an honest Way, least he shou'd be known, and detected, and punished with Death, for being seen at large before the Expiration of his sentenced Transportation. In this terrible Condition, and Extremity of Affairs, having a Wife and Family, which during his former Confinement, had contracted Debts, he was under double Apprehensions and Terror. His sole Employment was staying and idling in the Fields all Day, and returning Home to his Family by Night. He went on in this Manner, and led this Life, as long as his unhappy Wife could support him, by the Labour of her Hands; which after some Time was not in her Power to do. He then got acquainted with one

            , who led him again to all his former Courses of Vice; and seeing nothing but Destruction and Misery before his Eyes, he yet fell too easy a Captive to his Temptations and Snares, and once more fell to his former Trade. His Wife perceiving his Goings on, and what the End would be, often advised him to leave off, while it was in his Power, and that as his Character was blasted in London, and now no Possibility of getting an honest, tho' ever so mean Livelihood here, begg'd him to leave his Company, and retire with her to some Place, where his Character was not known; she proposed to him Portsmouth, and as he had been used to Sea, she advised him to go on Board a Guard Ship, while she was a-shore in some Pains-taking Way, and they might come together again one Day, and live happily. But this Scheme proved abortive. He promised her however he would go, he says, and the Day was fixed, and agreed on both Sides for their Departure, which was to be on the Day after he was apprehended for the Fact for which he suffered. His Wife, (glad she had perswaded him to consent to go with her) went out to</p>

Before the Wife return'd, both were set out, a Message being left they wou'd soon be at Home. Pendergrass supplied Edwards with about seven or eight Drams, between the Place of his Habitation, and where the Fact was committed, besides Purl, in order to prepare him for the Crime he intended Edwards should commit. Accordingly, coming to the House in <placeName id="OA17500207-geo-50">

            <p>He bless'd God, that in all his unfortunate Courses of Life, using People ill, and Murder, was what he never intended, but rather abominated. And as to what he did, when he was taken, he declared as a dying Man, he knew not that he hurt any one, till he was afterwards told so. Had he not been in Liquor, he said, he should not have drawn a Knife, the which he bought a Day or two before for his own Conveniency, when he had not the least Thought of committing this Robbery, nor had he any Intention, when he bought it, to hurt any one with it. He was in hopes his Years and Family being represented, would have been a Means of moving Compassion towards him; but as he could obtain no farther Respite for this World, he died, he said, in Charity with all Men, forgiving, as he hoped to be forgiven, and laid down this Life in Hopes of a better.</p>
            <p>He certainly has been a notorious Thief, Shop-lifter, and House-breaker, but was very reserved in his Temper, and would by no means confess any Fact, or Person concern'd with him in any other, but what was too public for him to think of concealing. The Fact he suffered for was certainly a most audacious Piece of Villainy, and the Circumstances attending it so flagrant as not to admit of any Alleviation with regard to the Punishment of the Law; which being too publickly known, was a Bar to all Thoughts of Mercy to be expected, tho' he could not help entertaining some Hopes of it, till within a Day or two of Execution.</p>

            <p>I Hope and beg you will make yourself as easy as you can about me; don't grieve too much on my Account, I suffer no more than I have richly deserved, and both you and I might expect. Comfort yourself therefore I was not suffer'd to go on any longer in my evil Courses, for the longer I had lived the worse it might have been. Tho I am to suffer this shameful and ignominous Death, I would have you make yourself easy, and learn a good Lesson from it. If possible, my Dear, pluck up so much Courage, and give not yourself over to Grief and Sorrow, for that can avail nothing to me, nor yourself. My Dear, I trust we may have a happy Meeting in Heaven, where we shall neverbe parted, but all Sorrow and Tears shall be wiped away. I hope we may yet be happy, and live in the Presence of Angles, and just Men made perfect. I have been unworthy of this World, and part with it in Hopes of enjoying for ever the World to come, thro' the all-sufficient Merits of my Jesus Christ. Now my dear Soul mind what I say, it is the last Request of your affectionate dying Husband,</p>

Brenan got a Hammer and Chissel, and said, he would have Money, or he'd go again to the Place from whence he came. Accordingly he went with this Resolution, and the first Thing he did, was to knock a Man down, and take away his Hat. This they immediately went and pawn'd for 18 d. which was drank out in Gin, and now they were ripe for Housebreaking, or knocking down People, or any other Mischief that fell in their Way; and several other mischievous Blows were given to different Persons that Night, by the Hands of Brenan, with this dangerous Weapon the Hammer.</p>
