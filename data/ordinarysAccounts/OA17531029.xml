By a Disorder in his Head he was rendered incapable of sticking close to Business, or he might have lived very well. In the hard Winter some Years since, he had some very fine Work put into his Hands, but the Severity of the Weather, he says, hindered him from going on with it, and he chose rather to enter himself on board an East-India Ship, in which he went abroad, and was a <rs id="OA17531029-occupation-11" type="occupation">Soldier</rs>

               <join result="persNameOccupation" targOrder="Y"
                     targets="OA17531029n23-1 OA17531029-occupation-12"/>, than ever he had done in his Life before. So that tho' he had formerly been somewhat out of his right Senses, he did not alledge any Thing of that Kind in alleviation of what he had done to deserve the Sentence of the Law, which he suffered for uncurbed Passion, but owned himself highly to blame, and said, were the Matter to be disputed between him, and the Murdered again, he would have gone another way to Work with him, and instead of murdering him, would have sought Redress from the Law.</p>
            <p>The Murdered, he said, was a bad Man, and frequently pilfered from him, and others in the same House, where several lived together. And besides, he said, opprobrious and bad Language was the Consequence of his being accused and reproached by them, for such unjustifiable Behaviour towards them. And their Quarrels upon that Account was the Cause of that Resentment which proved the Ruin of both.</p>
            <p>It happened once, upon a Time of their Quarrelling, and having high Words, that Hayler kicked Proby, the Person whom he murdered so barbarously, by giving him several Blows with a Hammer; upon which, a Warrant of Assault and Battery was obtained against him. This occasion'd a continual Grudge between them, so that they were at Enmity between each other for the rest of their days.</p>
            <p>They worked together, and lodged in the same House, so that they had too frequent Opportunities of being together. It seems by Hayler's own Account, that they were both unhappy ignorant People; their Passions were too strong for their Reason. And, in their way of Life, being too frequently addicted to unman themselves by excessive Drinking, was the fatal Cause of this Murder.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175310290005"/>
            <p>The Day the Murder was perpetrated, he said, the Devil and Gin were very strong and powerful in them. They fell out, and had many provoking Words passed between them; and in order to get the better of him, Hayler took the Advantage of a Hammer which lay in the Room, gave him several Blows, and killed him. He owned the Justice of his Suffering, and said he was heartily sorry for what he haddone. As he had taken away a poor Man's Life in the Midst of his Sins, he dreaded the fatal Consequence. As he had Reason to think the Load of his own was too great to bear, the other added to it, he feared, was more than he could sufficiently lament; tho' he died in Hope of God's Mercy through Christ's Merits.</p>
            <p>His Behaviour, upon Tryal, was indeed somewhat shocking to behold. For, though he knew his Guilt, he seemed to smile at what was said against him. But this, I believe, was owing rather to a Want of Sense to apprehend the calamitous Circumstances he had brought himself to; because, tho' not mad, or out of his Senses, he was so excessively ignorant, as one would think no Person in human Shape could be. However, he died not without a Sense of suffering very deservedly for so enormous a Crime as Murder.</p>

Some oysters he sold to one, but refusing to sell to another person who would have bought, under pretence of charging him with a debt of a penny, Turney (who died by a stab in the heart, in consequence of a scuffle, which ensued upon his refusal) resented it. Words passed between Gallaker and Turney, and after a blow from the former to the latter, they engaged, and both came to the ground. The whole evidence agree in the first blow, that it was given by Gallaker; and one of them describes particularly the position they both were in at the time he apprehends the wound was given, and swears positively to the motion of Gallaker's arm, while he observed the situation in which they lay. From which evidence any one might conclude how Turney came by his death.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175310290006"/>
            <p>He denied the fact, 'tis true, to the last; for I asked him with respect to it just before he was turned off. But what can be more circumstantial proof of murder than what the evidence already mentioned, who observed the motion of the arm as they lay on theground, and the hollow between them, made by Turney's endeavour to rise, while Gallaker held him by the collar? Add to this, his offering his knife to a person to whom he refused to sell oysters, who told him, he deserved to be lick'd for refusing. What was his reply? Why, the evidence says, he took up his knife in his hand, and asked him,</p>
            <p>'How would you like to have this in</p>
            <p>'your guts?' An expression that favours strong of a wicked and revengful mind. And, even when it was discovered that Turney was wounded, and Gallaker was about to escape, what did he say when he was brought back? Why, when he was told he had murdered the man, he offered his knife again at the person who told him so, saying,</p>
            <p>'What is that to you? I don't care if I do the same by you.' Nor would Gallaker part with the fatal weapon, till it was by violence cut off from his side, where it hung by his apron-string. Are these indications of a mind free from malicious and revengeful designs? Could a knife run itself three or four inches deep through the ribs into the heart? But, with God there is mercy; therefore every one would charitably hope, that even the perpetrator of so rash and barbarous an act as this seems to carry the face and appearance of, may have some reliance on infinite degrees of goodness.</p>
            <p>Gallaker called one to prove the contrary; but the man happened to have so much modesty as not to proceed so far as to contradict what had before been given in evidence against him.</p>

Being further searched, several handkerchiefs were found upon him, which the owners present at his examination before a justice laid claim to, and then he owned, he came down upon that lay, to pick pockets, and to go on the highway, or any other mischief that came in his way, he was ripe for. To extricate himself from this share, he impeached two persons, who were taken up upon his information. But, no particular accusation being brought against them, both they, and he were let go.</p>

            <p>After conviction, upon full proof of the fact, he not denying, he behaved as one sorry for his mispent life. He said, extravagance had brought him to it, for which himself was not more to blame than somebody else, but said not whom he meant.

He says, had he given heed to his father's directions, it had been better for him; but, to his misfortune, he always run retrograde to all the advice given him, both by parents and others.</p>
            <p>At about 16 years of age he was bound apprentice to a person that hir'd</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175310290010"/>

            <p>During the 12 months, a person who was not much his friend, persuaded him to leave his mistress, he says, which he refused for some time; but, after a while, he was unluckily prevailed on to behave in such a manner as he was directed, which might reasonably be productive of complaints, and be the occasion of her being glad to get rid of him. In pursuance of such bad advice, he accustomed himself to lay out of nights, which occasioned uneasiness to her; and, after some time, thus transgressing against the good order of her family and house; she was willing to give up his indentures, and he was at liberty to be turned over.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, he says, he was turn'd over to a master, and he served out seven years, and was reckoned a useful fellow in his way. But, when his time was out, having perhaps not been so very diligent as expected, he was sued and arrested for 20 l. loss of time-money, during his apprenticeship. He says, this was about last Christmas was twelve months. After some time he had his liberty again, upon condition of paying so much a week. He did so, he says, for some time; but afterwards neglecting, for some weeks, to pay, he was again arrested in April last, as he was passing the <placeName id="OA17531029-geo-40">

            <p>However, finding himself thus harrassed, and not liking the usage he had met with, he forsook his industry, and resolved to get a livelihood some how, and in time fixed upon one no way justificable, such as generally produces the utter ruin of the person exercised thereby. He got into bad company of both sexes, and having taken to idleness, and cast himself out of all honest employment, he became a prey to villany and wickedness. Being of a robust constitution, and daring spirit, he was a match for any undertaking however desperate, and had strength to oppose almost any single man's arms.</p>
            <p>His character seemed to stand pretty well in his neighbourhood, till some few months past. He was liable to drinking, and when in liquor was turbulent and troublesome; but as to labour, till he came to be linked in his last company's service, he was generally looked upon as a useful fellow.</p>
            <p>He owns he has been guilty of several robberies, and concerned with several people, and was frequently upon the pick-pocket lay, but had the good luck to escape till last October sessions.</p>
            <p>On the 26th of September he was concerned in the robbery for which he suffered, and was a principal actor in it. After which he met with a wench a day or two after, with whom he used to keep company, and promised to meet her again at night in <placeName id="OA17531029-geo-41">

            <p>but instead of coming herself, she sent people to apprehend him; which they did.</p>
            <p>He owned the fact, and the justice of his suffering, behaved very quiet and patiently under his unhappy fate, but would not say what other particular robbery, he had been concerned in, though he said he had been too much concerned in such evil practices. He said further, he was very sorry for what he had done, but that he was drove to it by ill usage. He hoped those whom he injured would forgive him, and trusted in the Lord for pardon of all his sins upon his repentance, and strength in Christ's merits.</p>

            <p>I understood, that he had wrote out a vast number of tricks, which he had played in his time, in both these capacities, which he intended to have sent into the world, and to have made publick, if his life had been spared, as he entertained great hopes of it; but was resolved to destroy them if he was executed. Some stir was made to save him, but the notoriety of his life was a barr to all those hopes or attempts succeeding, as may be very reasonably presumed. He boasted of having encouraged, and sent people a thieving, that he might have opportunity of taking them afterwards.</p>

Shields was the promoter of this robbery, as they both said at that time. He set them upon it, and stood at a distance himself, while they robbed the gentleman; and when he saw there was danger, he ran away. And afterwards, as they further said, he was instrumental in their being taken, being the main evidence to convict them; and they were both executed.</p>
            <p>Also in the year 1751, Sheilds and Penpraise (a most notorious stealer of goods upon the river Thames, transported) gave evidence against a poor cobler at <placeName id="OA17531029-geo-50">

            <p>Shields did rob in <placeName id="OA17531029-geo-51">

            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA175310290013"/>

He was a stout-made young fellow, fit for any enterprize; and I can say no more of him, but that after conviction he seemed to behave very quietly.

            <p>Note, At the sessions in September last, Hailey was so wicked as to charge a poor widow woman with picking his pocket of the Sum of a guinea and an half. Accordingly he swore, and went before the grand-jury to give his evidence upon the pretended case; but the grand-jury saw into the villany, and that it was a malicious and wicked attempt, and threw out his bill of indictment against her. However, the affair was attended with great expence and inconveniency to the poor woman, who is upwards of 60 years of age; whereby she is much injured, though he missed of his design of taking away her life, upon account of some private pique and resentment he had entertained against her.</p>

When they were come there, they were all put into one cart, and the halter being about their several necks, they were tied up to the fatal tree. Then some time was spent in prayer, recommending their souls to the Almighty's protection. After which, the four protestants desired time to sing a psalm, and they did sing two or three verses of the 104th psalm. Shields was reading his own book. Sullivan could not read; and Hailey endeavoured to behave with a most uncommon assureance and undauntedness, such as amazed all the beholders of this sad fate. When the caps were drawn over their eyes, they uttered repeated callings on the Lord Jesus Christ to have mercy on them, and to receive their fouls, before the cart drew from under them. The dismal scene went on without any interruption or disturbance; and their bodies were delivered to the care of their friends.</p>
