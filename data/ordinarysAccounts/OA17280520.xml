            <p>While under Sentence, they were instructed, How, that by Nature, they were Enemies to God: The Scripture representing to us, that the Imagination of Man's Heart is wholly set in him to do Evil; and that from this corrupt Principle, proceeded all the Irregularities of Life, which had entail'd so much Shame and Disgrace upon them: Therefore I endeavoured to convince them, that in order to be freed from their Sins, it was necessary to search into the Wickedness of their Hearts, which was the Cause of the manifold Failings of their Life; for that out of the Heart proceeds all evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, False Witness, Blasphemies, Matth. 15. 19. Thence I exhorted them to come to God, under a deep Sight and Sense of Sin, Original and Natural: For while we are not sensible of Sin, it cannot be suppos'd, that we will seek a Saviour to save us from Sin, who is our Lord Jesus Christ, the only Mediator betwixt God and Man. Thence I took occasion to press upon them the absolute Necessity of a Saving Faith in Christ, the Son of God, and Saviour of Mankind, ev'n a Lively Faith, attended with Good Works, bringing forth manifold Fruits unto new Obedience, Holiness, and Virtue.</p>
            <p>Many of them appearing Obstinate, I instructed them, that it was not only Expedient, but Necessary to confess their Sins, especially Those for which they suffer'd, as in the first Place of God, who was chiefly offended, so in the next Place, to Man, whom they had so very much wrong'd, since this was the main Reparation they were capable to make. This Subject I illustrated to them from several weighty Considerations taken from St. James 5. 16. Confess your Faults one to another. I also told them, that there being Two Christian Sacraments, Baptism, wherein we were initiated in the Christian Faith to deny Ourselves to the World, the Flesh, and the Devil; and the Lord's Supper, which is a lively Representation of the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus, exhibited to us in a familiar Manner adapted to our Senses. This Sacrament, as from other Texts, so particularly from Rev. 19. 7. - For the Marriage of the Lamb is come, I explain'd to them.</p>
            <p>While these and many such Instructions were given them, in Chappel all of them comply'd with the Worship, and made regular Responses: But some of them at Times were very undecent in their Carriage, laughing and playing the Fool in a very extravagant manner. <persName id="OA17280520n7-1">

When I reprov'd him sharply for it, he said, that it was out of no ill Design, and that he could not help it: I told him that it was a Temptation of Satan, and that it shew'd the Corruption of his Heart very much. After many Admonitions and Reproofs, he gave it over. Crowder and Rawlins at several Times flew into very violent Passions, and upon trifling Occasions struck Hornby; for which being seriously reprov'd, they promis'd not to do so any more, and declar'd their Grief for the Offence given. <persName id="OA17280520n7-2">

His Father was a Man unmindful of his Family, and by his Negligence, lost a considerable Estate in Money, which belong'd to him; and as his Substance decreas'd, he took less Care of his Son's Education, leaving him expos'd to the World, and went to Ireland, where he now resides. He confess'd himself to be guilty of the Robbery of which he was Convicted; and said, that he had not follow'd that way of Life above three Quarters of a Year, before he was apprehended; and that there was no Pretence of Necessity for his betaking himself to such a Course; the only Cause having been his own Wickedness. He was a resolute, audacious Fellow, but of a superior Sense to most, if not all his Unfortunate Companions. Once in the Cell, he said to <persName id="OA17280520n15-2">

Russell was naturally an Audacious Resolute Fellow, and commonly express'd himself with a deal of Freedom, and without any Offence in my Presence, excepting that once in the Cell being angry at something, he swore to one of the Keepers, for which I reprov'd him, and he beg'd God Pardon. His Education having been better than what most of his Companions had got, he was not so Rude, but more Civil in his Deportment than They. He own'd, that he had been a very great Sinner, and that he was guilty of all Sins, but Murder; and that his Sentence was most just according to Law. He declar'd himself sincerely Penitent for all his Offences; that he died in Peace with all the World, and in the Faith of being Sav'd by the Mercy of God, through the Merits of Jesus Christ.</p>

He confess'd the particular Fact, of which he was convicted, and that he had not follow'd the business of Thieving long. The Evidence against him had been one of his chief advisers to Wickedness, and that there was not the least Shadow of occasion for his betaking himself to such wicked Courses, since he wanted nothing, and his Father intended very soon to set him up in his own business, which was a Butcher.</p>
            <p>When His Majesty's Proclamation came out for apprehending Street-Robbers, he foreseeing the danger, agreed to go a four years Voyage to Sea, but upon Dalton's Information he was Apprehended before he could put his design in Execution. He told me, that he had join'd himself to a Society for improvement in religious Principles and Practices; but to this he did not prove an ornament. In the Cell, a Friend desir'd him seriously to prepare for Eternity, and not to entertain any hopes of a Reprieve; he replied, we shall certainly be all Repriev'd on Monday next, about two of the Clock. He behav'd always with abundance of civility, but that he Smil'd too often in the Chapel, which disturb'd some of his Neighbours, this, he said, was a natural Weakness, which he could not help. I represented to him the greatness of his Sin, as committed against much Light and Knowledge. He acknowledged himself among the chief of Sinners, that he was griev'd for betaking himself to such a wicked Life, which had brought him to a shameful Death, that he believ'd in Christ his only Saviour, repenting truly of all his Sins, and dying in Peace with all Mankind.</p>

At first he denied the Fact of which he was convicted, but afterwards Russel openly owning it, he could not deny his being concern'd in committing that Robbery. He said, that he had not follow'd the trade of Thieving long, but that he always had a coveteous mind, affecting an idle and loose Life most. He was more sober and civil in his carriage than several of the Street-Robbers. He declar'd, that he believ'd to be sav'd only through the merits of Jesus Christ, that he was heartily griev'd for, and repented of all his Sins, and that he died in Peace with all Mankind.</p>

Most times at Chapel he behav'd himself gravely and made his responses regularly, but was too ready to Smile as some others of them did; and once in time of Worship fell a beating Hornby upon some discontent, not worth mentioning: For this they were both taken out of Chapel; and when I represented to them the inconsiderate brutishness of such a Sin; He acknowledg'd the same, promising never to do the like for the future. When I spoke to him privately, he always own'd himself Penitent, but (as I was inform'd) he frequently behav'd himself in the Cells with great undecency; particularly, as his fellow Criminal Russel inform'd me, once as he was Swearing and showing the height of Passion and Fury upon the least, or rather no occasion; He and some other of the Prisoners desir'd him to be quiet, and make some suitable preparation for Death. He said, what does it signify to prepare, since they had past such a wicked Life in the World, and now having so short a Time to live, it was needless to Repent; for he despair'd of God's Mercy and knew he should be Damn'd. He could not deny that he said so, and beg'd God's Pardon for it.

He had been long and frequently in Prison for Villainous Actions, had undergone Sentence of Death, for which he had his Majesty's most gratious Pardon, and had been Transported. His way of Living was upon the Catch; and was certainly very troublesome to Society, having had no settled Employment or Business. He was very quiet and peaceable in his Carriage, and us'd none of those foolish or brutish Miscarriages, which some of the younger Fellows had done. He had certainly been Guilty of very wicked Practices, and was very ignorant; altho' other ways he seem'd naturally to be of a good Under standing, and too much upon the Cunning or rather Sneaking Lay, as they term it. He was very attentive at Chapel, and at other times in the Cells, declar'd himself sincerely Penitent, that he justly Suffer'd, and died in the Faith of Jesus, and in peace with all the World</p>
