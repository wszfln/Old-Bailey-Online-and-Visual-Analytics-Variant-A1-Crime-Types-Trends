            <p>While under Sentence, they were first instructed in the Articles of our Christian Faith, necessary to be known, that God having made Man upright, after his own Image, and he having fallen from the Obedience due to his Maker, and by Consequence render'd himself uncapable of the Rewards entail'd upon Obedience; yet then God pity'd us in our low Estate, and gave his only beloved Son for us, that whosoever believed in him, might not perish but obtain eternal Life: And that we must not only believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God our only Saviour, but this Faith must be attended with a true Repentance for all our Sins, an Amendment of our Lives and Holiness, in all Manner of Life and Conversation; for without Holiness no Man can see the Lord, Heb. 12. 14. Some of these Malefactors having been notoriously wicked and obstinate Sinners, wholly destitute of Virtue, and immers'd in Vice; I let them in a a few Words see the Difference between Virtue and Vice. That Vice was an aberration and departing from the Rule of right Reason, which God had naturally implanted in the Minds of Men; and that it was also a Breach of divine Law, according to which we ought to regulate our Actions; and that consequently, Vice and vicious Men must be an Abomination to God, and all good Men, in whom any rays of the Divine Image take Place: On the contrary, I show'd them, that Virtue was expressive of, and agreeable to that heavenly Pattern after which Man was made; that it was attended with a serenity of Mind, and that beside the promise of future Rewards, it was always accompanied with a Reward in its own Bosom, a good Conscience, which never fails to comfort a Man under the most violent Disasters. Some of them having shown too much disregard to the hearing of God's Word; I show'd them, with what Regard, Submission, Humility, Dread and Awe of the divine Majesty, we ought to hear God's holy Word from St. Luke 8, 18. Take heed therefore, how ye hear. I also instructed them in the nature of the Christian Sacraments, particularly, that of the Lord's Supper, which was proper to dispose them for Heaven, and that eternal Communion which the Saints enjoy with God in Glory.</p>
            <p>While these, and many other Instructions were given, all of them behav'd with much Reverence and Attention, excepting Featherby, Barnham, and Vaux, who were so wild and extravagant, that they could not be reduc'd to Order, till they were corporally punished for their Miscarriages in and out of Chappel. <persName id="OA17281111n6-1">

Hirons and Mackullister, were very Sick for several Days; when I visited them in the Cells, they always declar'd themselves very Penitent, and thankful for such Christian Visits. <persName id="OA17281111n6-2">

He confess'd, that he had been one of the greatest of Sinners ever was, in Swearing and Blaspheming, Drinking, Whoring, Gaming, and all kind of Vices. He appear'd to 've been a Fellow of a good natural Understanding, but of a distorted, wry Countenance, and a Visage portending nothing but the devilish Disposition of which he was. He acknowledg'd the Fact for which he was Convicted, and the Justice of his Sentence; that he had been a most expert Thief, in all the different Species's thereof; such as Shop-lifting, House-breaking, frequently acting the Foot Pad near the City, going out upon the Sneak, Pick-Pocketing, and Robbing in the Streets, &amp;c. He said, that he had often knock'd down Men, both in Town and Country, but that he never intended, nor committed Murder, neither did he ever do much harm to any Man's Person, to his Knowledge. He and his Associates denied that they knew any thing of the Robbery committed upon a Gentleman in a Coach between Kentish Town and Highgate, on the 24th, of September last, when a great many Papers of value were taken from the said Gentleman. They all said, that they never rob'd any body of Papers, but restor'd them as useless to themselves.</p>
            <p>When the other three behaved very disorderly in Chapel, Levee kept an outward Decorum, only sometime he Smil'd, and spoke to some of the rest.

I endeavour'd what I could  instruct and comfort him: He declar'd himself a true Penitent, that he believ'd in rist his only Saviour, and died in Peace th all mankind.</p>

He confest the Robbery of which they were Convicted, and that for two Years past and more, he had committed a considerable Number of Robberies of all Kinds. He was try'd with the rest of the Street-Robbers, who were Executed in May last, but Proof not being sufficient against him, he was Acquitted. He own'd that he had been one of the most profligate Fellows ever liv'd, addicted to all manner of Vices. He said, that he was lawfully married to a Woman, who some time ago was Transported. For two or three Days, when they were first under Sentence, he behav'd himself Decently; but after that, growing uneasy at his Restraint, and partly tempted by Barnham and Vaux, when he met with them at Chapel, or otherways; he turn'd one of the most obstinate Fellows that ever was under Sentence of Death.</p>
            <p>On Friday the 25th, of October, in the Evening, being lock'd up in the Cells, he look'd up at the Window of his own Cell, Blasphem'd at a prodigious Rate, Curs'd all the most eminent Persons in highest Authority; and having Drunk too liberally of that Liquor call'd Geneva, which some Persons privately gave him; he behav'd himself very Disorderly in the Cell all that Night. Next Morning when he came to Chapel, he would not be quiet, but disturb'd the Worship, by throwing Sticks at a Gentleman, by conversing with some of his Companions, and doing of many ludicrous Tricks; and a grave Man in the Chappel giving account, that it was he who bred the Disturbance, he beat him unmercifully, Storm'd and Curs'd him, so that as I was to Read a godly Discourse to them, I was oblig'd to Conclude. When the Keepers knew of this, they stapl'd him down in the Old Condemn'd Hold all that Night. On Wednesday the 30th of October, and Thursday Forenoon he staid from Chappel, upon a very bad Design, as I was afterwards informed. That Day a civil Gentleman, who is by Profession a Brewer, going to see them in the Cells, Vaux was so rude and impudent, as to throw a whole Pot of Beer upon him. That Afternoon they were Drunk and uneasie in Chappel. They were the most unthinking, foolish Creatures I ever saw. For their audacious Behaviour, Featherby, Barnham, Levee, and Vaux, were nail'd down in the Old Condemn'd Hold, all Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday Forenoon, 3d, 4th, and 5th, of November. I went two or three times to them, exhorted and Pray'd to them, when they promis'd me all Obedience, heartily comply'd with Prayer; declar'd themselves Penitent for their Misbehaviour, and other Crimes which they had committed; upon which, they were all four brought back to the Cells, and up to Chappel, where they behav'd with outward Decency. He was a bold desperate Fellow; but after the Dead Warrant was out, he behav'd very civilly, and with a deal of apparent Seriousness and Devotion. I reprov'd him sharply for all his Misdemeanors, for his Sinning against so much Light and Knowledge, and for giving so much Scandal, and Offence to Others, under the same Condemnation. He acknowledg'd his great Wickedness, begg'd Pardon of God and Man, for all the Sins of his Life; and express'd a Confidence he had of being sav'd by the Mercy of God, thro' the Merits of Christ, declar'd himself Penitent, and that he died in Peace with all Mankind.</p>

            <p>At the Place of Execution,</p>
            <p>THEY all behav'd with much Seriousness; Ferrebee said that the House where he was taken, was an honest House, knew nothing of his wicked Ways, that they were his Relations, and the Neighbourhood was injurious in entertaining any ill Opinion of them upon his Account. Barnham desired me to publish, that his Brother had been no ways instrumental to his Misfortunes, but that he always endeavour'd to reclaim, altho' his perverse disposition was such, that all Advices were ineffectual. Walker said, that he forgave his Prosecutors, and died in Peace with all Men, and in hopes of a blessed Immortality. White said he did not take Half a Crown from Langden, but that it was a private Quarrel between them in the Street. Mackullister and Hyrons adher'd to their former Confessions. Levee desired a Psalm to be sung last of all. The Lamentation of a Sinner, and Gloria Patria being sung, they all went of the Stage crying out, God have Mercy on us, and Lord Jesus receive my Spirit.</p>
            <p>This is all the Account given by me,</p>
