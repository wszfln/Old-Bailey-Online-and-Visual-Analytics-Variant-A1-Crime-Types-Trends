            <p>On the LORD's DAY the 7th instant, I preach'd to them, both in the Morning and Afternoon, upon Deut. 32. 29. O that they were wise, that they understood this; That they would consider their latter end!</p>
            <p>In my Explanation of which Words, I shew'd them, That it is the greatest piece of Wisdom for Men to prepare themselves for Death; which is meant here in the Text, by LATTER END. And that, because,</p>
            <p>I. This Preparation is of absolute necessity to avoid Everlasting Misery, and obtain Eternal Bliss.</p>
            <p>II. The time for this Preparation is but short, tho it were the whole of our natural Lives.</p>
            <p>III. This Time i often made shorter by the Follies and Sins of Men; as it is in the melancholy Objects now before us. Having enlarg'd upon these Particulars, I concluded with a pressing Exhortation to the Persons condemn'd, That they would consider the fewness of the Days now remaining them, and earnestly implore God's Grace to enable them to make a right use of them, in order to their Salvation.</p>
            <p>While they were under this Condemnation I visited them, and had them twice every day in the Chappel; where I endeavour'd to render them sensible of their woful State by Sin, and perswade them to recover themselves by Faith and Repentance; for which I gave them the best Directions I was capable of, and had some other Divines (besides my self) to discourse them upon that Subject, and shew them the necessity of clearing their Consciences by Confession. But they harden'd themselves against all Admonitions and were so desperately obstinate, as to venture the loss of their immortal Souls, rather than comply with the wholesome Advices that were given them.</p>

He confess'd he was guilty of this Fact, as he had been before of others of the like nature. But he would not discover the Persons that were concerned therein; saying, that he would bring no Man into trouble now; but that if he had known it should have gone so hard with him at his Tryal, perhaps he would have brought in one or two to suffer with him for Fancy-sake. These were his very Words. All that was offer'd to him, both by my self and others, prov'd of little use to the perswading him to disburthen his Sin loaded Conscience, by a free and ingenuous Confession, which he ought to make, and which could be of no prejudice to any, but of general use and service to the Publick, and possibly of particular benefit and advantage to those very Persons, whose Names and Facts he was so unwilling to make known. What I could get from him in this respect, was only this; That there were some Persons lie knew, but would not name, that had formed a Design to rob a certain House in the Country, at such and such a time, which he mention'd; telling me that it might be prevented, if I did signify the same to the Person whose House it was, But as he would by no means speak more openly to this matter, nor discover them, who were to commit that Robbery; so I perceiv'd, that he was not heartily dispos'd to serve honest Men, especially when I consider'd, not only the manner, but the time of his acquainting me with this wicked Design, which was but some few hours before it should have been executed, and the Place at a pretty distance from London; so that there was hardly time enough left for me to inform the Gentleman concern'd therein, that he might duly provide against it: Nevertheless it was taken care of; and such wicked Persons, whoever they are that contriv'd the Mischief, have found, and (by the Grace of God) will always find such their ill Attempts, fruitless and dangerous to themselves</p>
            <p>When any one would speak to this Malefactor, <persName id="OA17070912n11-1">

However, I desisted not from my Endeavours of breaking him off from his Error and Obstinacy: But his Heart was so harden'd, and so season'd in Wickedness, that no good could be wrought upon him. He confess'd indeed, That he had been a great Sinner, That he might, if he would, have lived very well, by following the Sailor's Profession, or the Business of a Gardiner (or Nursery-man) both which he understood, and had been long employ'd in, and particularly the former; he having gone several Voyages beyond the Seas, and been in some Actions, wherein he had receiv'd some Wounds. He said, that he was not above 34 years of Age; yet had seen and done many things. When I ask'd him how he came to steal Books, as he had done, both formerly and now; he said he never stole any but twice, and the first time was a great while ago, and a great way off; but he would not tell where or when. And as to those Books, for the stealing of which he stood under this Condemnation, he said it was not in his or his Companions mind to have taken them, if they could have presently lighted on something better: Neither did they design to rob Sir John's House, but they mistook it; their Design being then upon another. But whose House that was, or who they were that assisted him, he would not declare. Both he and Elby, I verily believ'd, encourag'd one another in their wicked Obstinacy; which was such, as that I may say, I have hardly met with the like in almost seven years that I have been in this melancholy Office. God grant I may never see such harden'd Sinners again; and that Men, whose unhappiness it is to have been engag'd in Sin, may not in imitation of this poor miserable Wretch, cast themselves away.</p>
            <p>When he was come to <placeName id="OA17070912-geo-3">

Here I (as I had at other times) shew'd him, that by such a Discovery (which in Law could not affect or hurt any of his Companions) he would do a great deal of good, not only to others, but chiefly to his own Soul, which was now in great danger of being sentenc'd to Hell for this his unaccountable Obstinacy. But notwithstanding all this, he persisted to the last in his wilful and tenacious humour, and would not be by any means perswaded out of it; but express'd some vain hopes of his obtaining Mercy. Whereupon I openly declared to him (for the discharge of my Duty) in the presence of the Spectators there, That if he did not clear his Conscience by making such a Confession as I had often, and now again press'd him to make; i. e. To discover his wicked Accomplices, and all things of which he could usefully inform the World; I did verily believe his Soul should be eternally lost. And therefore earnestly pray'd him to take care of this, and consider it well, and make an open Declaration of what he knew in those Matters that had been discours'd of. But instead of giving me satisfaction herein, he fell upon reflecting on the Severity of his Sentence, tho he could not deny but that it was very just, and that he had deserved the Condemnation he was under. Which was so palpable and so evident a Truth, that he was forc'd to acknowledge it; saying, That he was sensible God (in his Justice) had appointed this Death for him, for his great Sins He declared, that he dy'd in Charity with all the World; and seem'd outwardly to join with me in Prayers and singing of Psalms; and thanked me for my Pains about him. After I had recommended him to the Direction of the Divine Spirit, and pray'd that God would be pleased to soften his hard Heart, I went from him, to whom some further time was allow'd for private Devotions. When he was ready to be turn'd off, he cry'd to God for Mercy, in these and the like Ejaculations. Lord have Mercy upon me! Lord Jesus receive my Soul! &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But how fruitless (alas!) are all such Prayers, which the meer Terrors of Death and Hell extort from such undone Wretches, is but too apparent. God grant, others may be wiser, and consider better (and in due time) their Latter End here, so as to make sure Provision for a happy Eternity hereafter.</p>

He own'd he was guilty of the latter of these Facts; but for the Murther he would not confess it: Neither would he be perswaded to discover his Accomplice or Accomplices, nor any other Facts by him or them committed heretofore. And in this his obstinacy he all along persisted; and was so peremptory as to say, That if any should ask him again any such Questions, he would presently knock them down. Upon which I told him, that I was very sorry to see him in that furious Temper, very unbecoming a Man that was upon his everlasting State; but I hop'd he would consider things better, and give me leave to ask him (for I would certainly do it whatever came on't) such Questions as were fit to be resolv'd by him for the good of Mankind, and for the clearing of his Conscience before he dy'd. But he say'd, he would resolve none; for he intended to die in Charity with the World; which he could not do, if he brought any into trouble. To this I answer'd, that he was highly mistaken, and that his discovering his Companions in Wickedness could not be an Evidence at Law against them, and could do them no harm, but possibly a great deal of good, and would be a Charitable Deed to them; for by this means they might be reform'd, and so prevent their coming nder the same Condemnation with</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA170709120002"/>
            <p>him: And that also, such a Discovery as he could and ought to make of those wicked Persons he had been concern'd with, and those Robberies and other unjust Actions he had committed, would dispose him to die well, i. e. in peace with God, and his own Conscience, and in Charity with all Men, especially with those he had wrong'd, who ought to receive from him at least the Satisfaction of a sincere Acknowledgment of the Injuries which he had done them, either by himself or in conjunction with others. He gave the ear to all this; but was not perswaded by it, nor by any thing else that was at any time laid before him: But said, that he would not come to Particulars; and that in general he was willing to confess, that he had been very wicked, and that he had committed all manner of Sins whatsoever, and that he would confess them to God alone, and ask his Pardon for them. So far he came, but would come no further; chusing rather to have his own wilful humour, and perish with it, than to secure his Salvation by those reasonable and just Methods that were proposed to him. This was no small grief to me to see a Man, whom I endeavour'd to instruct and reform, and thereby bring to God, thus deseprately fly from him, and sink himself deeper and deeper into Error and Destruction. All that was left for me to do, was to pray for him, and desire him, to pray for himself, That God would please to encline his Heart the right way, and open his Eyes, that he might see and embrace the things belonging to his Eternal Peace before they were hid from him. When I told him, that he did very ill in cursing the whole Bench, as he did at the Old Baily, and that he should be now asham'd and sorry for it, he seem'd to be unconcern'd; neither did he express much grief for any thing he had done; saying, that he was to answer with the loss of his Life for all his Faults; and why should he be grieved for them, since he must die, and was willing to die? I perceiv'd he would not be thought to be afraid of Death; but I could not be satisfy'd with his manner of preparing for it. His Pride and Self-conceitedness were more prevalent with him than any Argument from Reason and Religion that could be offer'd to him. I labour'd to make him truly sensible, that what he so much valu'd and admir'd himself for, was certainly odious in the sight of Men of Understanding, and that to say no worse, he discover'd a great weakness of Judgment to fancy that he should be better esteem'd for his stistness and stubborness of Heart, than for his being humble and contrite, and melted into Repentance. After much discourse and time spent with him, both in publick and private, he at last seem'd to relent a little; and gave this following Account of his past sinful Life, and the present State he was now in.</p>

Now who that Man was, and whether there were no more with him at that time, he would not at all resolve; and he grew very angry for being asked such Questions, which, he said, put all the good things out of his Head I had put in it before; telling me withal, that he had desir'd me this Morning at <placeName id="OA17070912-geo-8">

Further I told him, that how unpleasant soever it might be to him to have Questions asked him, in relation to the disposing him to clear his Conscience, and make his Peace with God and Mankind; yet he must give me leave to go on with pressing him to make such Declarations as were so very useful as he had been particularly told.</p>
            <p>And here I shewed him a Letter, which was delivered to me as I was upon my way to Fulham; desiring him to tell me whether it came from him; he told me it did: Then I ask'd him, who Stole the 250 l. in Money, a Gold Watch, and other Goods therein mention'd; he answer'd, It was himself; upon which I ask'd him further, Who were concerned with him in that Robbery? he told me, No body. This is all that he said upon this Matter. If any desire to know the Particulars of that Letter, they may read the Copy of it at the Close of this Paper. But to return to the matter that was the great occasion of his Death: I again earnestly prayed him not to deny this Murther if he had actually committed it, and to consider that tho he had not done it with his own Hand (which seem'd strange to believe, as being most contrary to all Evidence and Circumstances) yet he was certainly guilty of it; for he owned himself to be then in the Company of him that kill'd Mr. Barry's Gardiner. And therefore he must repent for being concerned in shedding innocent Blood; and he cou'd not with a safe Conscience go out of the World without discovering the Party that committed this Bloody Fact. He gave me this Answer, That he would never do it. I prayed for him, and he seemed outwardly to join with me, both in Prayer and in the Penetential Psalms that were sung. Then I asked him, whether he was not desirous that the Worthy Minister of the Parish should come to him, which I questioned not but that he would charitably do, if he were sent for. He seem'd to be very indifferent for it. I ask'd him again; and then he said he would be glad of his Prayers, but he would by no means have any further Questions put to him. Mr. Barry (that is the Name of Reverend the Rector of Fulham) came to him, and made him a most Excellent Exhortation; shewing him his great Concern for his Soul, which he apprehended to be in great Danger. He thereupon press'd him to an open Confession, as a means by which he might be saved. Several proper things he laid to his Consideration, and then retired. After this, this miserable Malefactor, who still remain'd in his Obstinacy, would not suffer me to do any thing more here, but Pray and Sing Psalms; which I did. And then for a Conclusion told him, That if God, as I had pray'd, would please to touch his Heart, I hop'd he would make such a Confession as he had been exhorted to, before the Breath was out of his Body, and that I would remain (till that time) in the Cart, to receive that Confession. This said, he had his Cap put over his Face, and he was told he should have what time he pleased for his Private Devotions: He answer'd, he desired no more than to say the Lord's Prayer, which he did, and added to it (as the Cart was drawing away) Lord receive my Soul!</p>
            <p>Now how little available such Prayers may be, when the Soul is not purg'd from Sin, is a lamentable Consideration. Which I would advise all Sinners not to pass by, but improve to their Amendment, and Eternal Comfort.</p>
            <p>There is no room here to say more; for I must give the Copy of that Letter above promised, which is as follows.</p>
            <p>Sir,</p>
            <p>YOU may remember in May last was two years, your House was broke open, and there was lost to the value of 250 l. in Money, in Gold and Silver, and sometime before you lost a Woman's Gold Watch, and one other Watch, the out-side Case being Tertoise-shell, studded, and two Pair of Stockings; and understanding, you have been many times desirous of knowing the Person. This presents to acquaint you that if you'll give your selves the Trouble of coming to Newgate (where I now am a Prisoner un-Sentence of Death) I believe you may be satisfied of the Truth of the same, I am, Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>Altho a dying Person, yet your humble Servant.</p>
