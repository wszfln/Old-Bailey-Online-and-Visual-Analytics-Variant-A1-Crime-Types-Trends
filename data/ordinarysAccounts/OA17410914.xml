A Gentleman whose Bread he daily received, whose Bounty and Indulgence he had often experienced, and whose good Offices he was ever sure of; and, after all, the Requital he made, was to take away that Life, which 'twas impossible for him again to restore: In Robbery there may be some Reparation, but in Murder there can be none; the Loss of Life stagnates all; 'tis the greatest Crime Man can commit; Barbarity to the last Degree, and calls aloud for Vengeance, for Whoso sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed. 'Twas represented to him, how little Expectation such a Man had for Mercy, who would give none; but, as nothing was impossible with God, he was desired to cry out with holy David, Deliver me from Blood Guiltiness, Oh God! thou God of my Salvation, and my Tongue shall sing aloud of thy Righteousness, Psalm 51. 14.</p>

            <p>Head to murder his kind Master, and for this hellish Purpose, he provided a big Stick or Club, which he hid for several Days under his Master's Bed. Before he could find an Opportunity, he had taken this damnable Resolution a long time before he put it in Execution, and followed him several Times to do it, though his Heart failed him; but at last the Devil's Power prevailed, and he perpetrated this dreadful Scene of Villainy and Barbarity, on his ancient Master, who was between 67 and 68 Years of Age, in the following cruel Manner.</p>
            <p>The old Gentleman had been out the 18th Day of June last, on some Business, and came Home about Nine or Ten o'Clock at Night, and, as his constant Custom was, sat in an outer Room till Bed Time, about Eleven or Twelve. Mr. Penny being undressed all but his Night-Gown, rose to go from the outer Room to his Bedchamber, and, as he walked along, this Monster of Wickedness came behind him, and with the aforementioned big Stick or Club, as himself said, (though the Indictment called it a Bar of Iron) he cruelly struck the old Gentleman in the hinder Part of his Head, which beat him down, broke his Skull, and he never spoke more; yet his Barbarity stopt not there, for he redoubled the Blow; and though he was fully dispatch'd, yet did this vile Man cut his Throat from Ear to Ear, and let all the Blood in his Body run out into what Vessels he had in the House: And so artful was he to prevent Discovery, that he mixt Water with the Blood, that it might not coagulate, and threw it down thro' a Grate into a sink before the Door; then stript both the dead Body and himself stark naked, to prevent any Spots of Blood being seen on his Cloaths, and carried his Master's Corpse upon his naked Back down Stairs, and threw it into the Bog-house. Some of the Blood was spilt on the Floor, which Hall endeavoured to wipe off, but in vain; neither could the Woman, who wash'd the Chambers, ever remove it.</p>
            <p>After this dreadful Scene was over, he kept Possession of his murdered Master's Chambers, and went to the Coffee-House as usual for his Master's Breakfast: The Deceased being missing, his Friends and Relations began to be very uneasy about him; they enquired every where both in and out of Town, but to no Purpose. At last 'twas thought proper to search the Bog-hose where the Body was found, after having lain there ten or eleven Days. Hall was taken up on Suspicion, but there not being Proof enough against him in July Sessions, his Trial was deferr'd til this last Sessions, when he was upon his own Confession convicted.</p>

            <p>Hall, after this Attempt, finding no Possibility of escaping, confessed the whole of this shocking Scene on Sunday, August 23, to a Friend, and on the Tuesday following related the same to the Relations of the Deceased, and confessed that the Murder and Robbery was entirely his own Contrivance, and that his Wife was wholly innocent, though she had been taken up on Suspicion, a Woman having sworn that she saw her go out of the Inn the next Morning, with bloody Linnen in her Apron, which proved to be a little inconsistent, as it afterwards appeared, by Hall confessing that he himself threw them in the Bog-house in a particular Place, where they were found; however, she was before that Confession, admitted to Bail on Five Hundred Pounds Security.</p>
            <p>Hall was an obstreporous, ill natur'd, sullen Man; inclined to Women, Drinking, and Gaming, for which his good Master often reproved him, and gave him the best of Advice. While under Sentence, he behaved quietly, and professed Penitence; but seemed a little too hard-hearted and indifferent.</p>
            <p>Though he confessed the Murder, yet he would not own the stealing any more than a Purse with 36 Guineas, notwithstanding a great deal more in Cash, as well as Bank Notes and a Diamond Ring, the Whole amounting to a considerable Sum, was missing.</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174109140006"/>
            <p>He was a Man of good Sense, and could talk very well, though he made such bad Use of it. He went to Church sometimes, and once received the Sacrament from a Friend of his worthy Master's. Being asked, why he pleaded guilty, and did not stand his Trial? He said, it was to discharge his Conscience, and save his innocent Wife, who might, perhaps, upon a positive Oath, have been convicted, though she knew nothing of the Matter, nor was in any Shape concerned.</p>
            <p>He seemed mightily affected that his Body should be hung in Chains, and exposed to open View for many Years after Death. But being reminded of the Heinousness of his Crime, and that his great Duty was to mind the grand Affair, the Salvation of his Soul, which lives when the Body is no more, he then seemed more composed.</p>
            <p>On Wednesday the 9th Instant, when the Dead Warrant was brought to Newgate, Hall was intreated, in a tender Manner, to make a good Use of his precious Moments, and to beseech GOD for Pardon for his Sins: At which Time he seemed much mollified, and almost wept; which was the first Instance of his being observed to be tender hearted, or much affected.</p>
            <p>Being asked concerning a Report pretty current about the Town, of his going several Nights into his Master's Room, very late, when he was in Bed, with a lighted Candle in his Hand, and looking in his Face, and his Master asking him what he wanted; and his retiring; also, about his Master's observing to some Friends, that for some Time past, his Man seemed to look surly, and their advising him to make a strong new Bolt for the Chamber Door on the Inside? He absolutely denied them, and said, they were idle Reports; and that he never knew his Master entertain any the least Suspicion of him.</p>
            <p>He declared his Faith in Christ, that he repented of his wicked Life, and was in Peace with all Men.</p>

                        targets="OA17410914n68-1 OA17410914-geo-111"/>Newgate</placeName>, on Tuesday the 30th of June. A few Days after I had Occasion for Money, I sent to Mr. Knight, who was my Taylor, for a Parcel I had left with him 3 or 4 Days before, which had 22 Guineas in it, contain'd in a Purse of my Master's, two Razors, a Case of Instruments, a Stock Buckle, some Sticks of Sealing-wax, and three or four Franks, which were all mine, excepting the Purse; the Taylor hearing where I was, instead of coming with it to me as I desired, carried them to Colonel De Veil's, who still has it in Possession; this I mention, because they intend to bring the Purse in as an Evidence against me.</p>
            <p>N. B. First, - Is it natural to suppose, was I guilty, but that in so long a Time, I should have absconded, whereas on the contrary, no one was more diligent, or could take more Pains in searching and enquiring after him than I was, having the Liberty of his two Horses to ride when and where I pleased, always coming Home, and lying in the Chambers of Nights as usual. All this I submit to the Judgment of every candid and impartial Reader, was I conscious of my own Guilt, whether I should have acted in the innocent Manner I did, but have fled as a Guilty one.</p>
            <p>2dly, Upon the strictest Search and Enquiry made by Mr. Wotton, &amp;c. on me, no one Thing was found belonging to Mr. PENNY, tho' Mr. Wotton has given out there was missing out of the Chambers a large Purse, and a Bank Note No 88, for 50 l. which if there ever was any such Note, I know nothing of; but since that Time I am credibly inform'd, there has been two Bank Notes of 100 l. each found, which had I been guilty in any one Point, I should have taken them, as all who knows it must believe; and as to the little Purse which was found at my Taylor's, in the Parcel I left with him, that Purse I admit was my Master's, which a few Days before his being missing, he gave to me with two 20 l. Bank Notes, and some Cash, with Orders to carry it to one Mrs. Streatfield, in Queen-Square, and brought her Receipt back to my Master for 75 l.</p>
            <p>3dly, For the last two Years I lived with my Master, I wrote all or most of his Letters, and was privy to most of his Affairs, from whence it's to be presumed, had I any such wicked Intention against him, of either Robbing or Murdering my Master, I should have done it at a Time when I was sure there was large Sums of Money in the Chambers, whereby I might be a Gainer, whereas at the Time</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174109140013"/>
            <p>he was missing or murder'd (as 'tis certain he was by somebody) he could have little or none; because the very Thursday he went out, being the 18th of June, was the last Day of Payments of the Pensions, for the Quarter that was then order'd; during this very Quarter as often as before, he has entrusted me to carry out and pay to the Persons that were entituled to receive it, 7 or 800 l. of a Day, I always discharging my Account faithfully, as those People can justify. - Had I been villainously inclin'd, either to murder or rob my Master, when those large Sums of Money were in the Chambers, would have been the Time.</p>
            <p>4thly, As a further Proof of my Innocence, the Day I was brought from the Gate-kouse to be re-examin'd by Colonel Deveil, the Keeper of the said Gatehouse, as he and I came over <placeName id="OA17410914-geo-112">

            <p>I had a Design to murder my Master for about a Month or more, before I did it; and having kept pretty much Company of late, and spent what I had, and being in Debt, I was resolved to stay no longer; accordingly June 17, having drank myself to a proper Pitch, I determin'd to put my Design in Execution.</p>
            <p>That Night my Master came Home between 11 and 12, and I pulled of his Shoes and Stockings, and he pulled of his Breeches in the Dining-Room, and was walking to his Bed-Side, with his under Stockings on, when I came behind him in his Bed-Chamber, (it being soon after 12) and with a large Oaken Stick, which I had kept under his Bed some Time for that Purpose, and which I had bought with Design to murder him with, and knocked him down at one Blow; and I am very sure he never knew who struck him, or was sensible of any Pain; after this I gave him two or three Blows on the Head, and believe he was quite dead, for he neither sigh'd or groan'd: This Stick I had in my Hand 8 or 10 Times before with a Design to murder him, but my Heart always fail'd me till now.</p>
            <p>It's impossible to describe the Horror and Confusion I was in at what I had done, and I wou'd have given a thousand Worlds if I had had them, that I had not done so cruel an Act, and I hated myself for the barbarity of the Action, and yet the Power of the Devil was so great, that he prompted me to cut his Throat, which I had no Occasion to do, for he certainly was dead, or dying, when I began.</p>
            <p>In order to do this, I went into the Dining-Room, and stript myself stark naked, that no Blood might appear on any of my Cloaths or Linnen, and then took a little black handled Knife (with which my Master used to cut Fruit and Cheese with) and cut his Throat, from whence issued such a vast Quantity of Blood, that it filled almost five Chamber Pots, when mingled with a little clean Water, which I did to make it pass thro' the Sink at the Door,</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174109140014"/>
            <p>the more easily; three of which Pots thus mixed, I flung down the Sink, and two into the Coal-Hole.</p>
            <p>Then I tyed his black Waistcoat which he wore that Day, about his Neck, which being lined with Duffel, I thought would the more easily suck in the Blood from his Throat; as soon as this was done, naked as I was, I flung him a-cross my Shoulder, and run with him to the Bog-honse, and threw him in Head foremost, about one (or soon after) in the Morning, at the large Hole, where they empty Close Stools.</p>
            <p>The Horror and Fear I was in was so great, that I rather flew than ran, never felt the Ground under me. As I returned from the Bog-house, my Fears and Apprehensions were such, that the Inn appear'd as if all in a Flame of Fire; when I came back to the Chambers, I took my Master's Coat, bloody Shirt, the Stick I knock'd him down with, and some Rags I had made Use of in wiping up the Blood, and run a second Time naked down to the Boghouse with them, and threw them into the second Seat of the Necessary-house, on the left Hand, opposite to where I had thrown the Body down, and where I believe the Relations found them; after this, I open'd the Writing-Desk, Scrutore, &amp;c. and took about 36 Guineas from out of my Master's Pocket and the Writing-desk, which I put into my Master's green Purse, which I found in his Breeches Pocket; I also took several useless Things, as Wax, Franks, &amp;c. which with the Purse I carried to Mr. Knight's, the Taylor, on the 18th, who upon my Commitment to Newgate, deliver'd them to Col. De Veil: My Master's two mourning Rings I had taken from his Fingers before I carried his Body out of the Chambers, and which Mr. Wotton has found where I directed him. I was under such Confusion, whilst searching the Chambers, that I scarce look'd over half the Drawers or Places, or scarce knew what I took: After this, I was all the remaining Part of the Night washing and rubbing the Rooms with Cloths, but found the Blood very difficult to get out, which made me wet them again, and light the Fire in the Morning to dry them; and then I went to fetch Mrs. Laws the Laundress, to wash them over again, telling her my Master had bled over Night at the Nose, and smear'd them.</p>
            <p>All that Day I went from Place to Place, but could find no rest or be easy; the horrid Murder of my Master still running in my Mind; but though I had done so foul a Crime, all my Thoughts were taken up how to conceal it, and the Body being in so secret a Place, I thought would not be found. Whereupon I went on Friday Morning, June 19, to Mr. Wotton, my Master's Nephew, to enquire after my Master, and to tell him he lay out all Night, and that he went out the Day before by Water, and said he would return at Night, but never did, and that I was afraid, my Master had come to some Harm, though I never told him my Master had bled at the Nose over-night, and blooded the Rooms, as I did the Laundress; for he ask'd me so many Questions, and was so particular in enquiring after his Uncle, that it gave me great Uneasiness, and terrify'd me; afterwards, I went generally twice every Day to Mr. Wotton, to know where to go to enquire after my Master, &amp;c. though every time I went, I was under great Anxiety, and Disquietude; and in this dismal State, I continu'd being all the While terribly afraid of laying or even being alone in the Chambers.</p>
            <p>On the Sunday after the Murder, I was so afraid, that I had my Wife to lay with me in my Master's Bed, and all Night long I could not sleep for dread and Horror; and a few Nights after, I had her again to lye at Chambers with me; and frequently ask'd Mr. Wotton to send somebody to lay at Chambers, for I did not care to be alone.</p>
            <p>On Monday, June 29, Mr. Wotton took me up, and when before the Justice, I stifly denied it, as I did likewise the next Day, even after the Body was found, though I was all over in a sweat the Instant I heard the Body was taken up.</p>

            <p>tures, on the Boxes under the Bed, and other Parts of the Room, greatly alarm'd me, for I, in my Confusion, had over-look'd it, and never saw it, though I continu'd so long in the Chambers, for I had not Resolution to look about the Bed-Chamber, and likewise hearing Mr. Wotton had besides the Parcel found at the Taylors, such strong Evidence against me, I grew greatly afraid, and thought I should be convicted; on this I readily came into a Proposal made to me, of an Escape, which miscarrying, and I being detected, threw me into a Flood of Tears, for then I knew all Hopes were lost.</p>
            <p>Soon after I was put into the Cells, and there, being so much alone, I began more seriously to reflect on my unhappy Case; and that, by my Denial of the Fact, I might bring an innocent Wife into the wretched Place where I was, (for she was then at large on Five Hundred Pounds Bal) which might kill her, and my Child, though I did not doubt of her Acquittal.</p>
            <p>On these Considerations, as well as to ease my own Conscience, I determined to make an ample Confession, which I had frequently a Desire to do; but, when just ready to confess, I flew back, and remained inflexible; but now, resolved upon it, I sent for Mr. Hawkins, formerly my Fellow-Servant, to whom I related the Whole of this barbarous Murder, and desired him to acquaint Dr. Penny, the Dean of Litchfield, and Mr. Wotton, with it, which he did; and they, and he, came to me in the Press-Yard, to whom I confirmed what I had confessed to Mr. Hawkins; and accordingly, as I told them I would, I pleaded guilty to all the Indictments the first Day of the Sessions.</p>
            <p>This Confession gave great Ease to my tortured Soul, and made my Mind much quieter: Though I own myself very sorry for one Action done since my Commitment to <placeName id="OA17410914-geo-115">

            <p>For which Purpose I was recommended by a Prisoner in Newgate, to an Attorney, who came to me soon after my Commitment, and I gave him at one Time 10 s. 6 d. and the next Day two Guineas more, to give two Witnesses, to swear my Master was seen alive the 18th, and to whom I was to give to more Money when the Business was done; and by the Attorney's Directions, I reduc'd into Writing a Description of my Master, and the Places he resorted to, for the Witnesses to swear, but after I had paid my Money to him, I heard no more of him; and I hear since he went and made an Information of what I had said to him and done to Col. Deveil, and delivered to him the Description of my Master under my own Hand.</p>

            <p>SESSIONS drawing near, Hall sent for one Mr. Coombes, of Grange-Court, Attorney at Law to act for him, as he had been his Father's Attorney Time past, who came to Hall, but upon Hall's requesting of him to act for him was refused, and Mr. Coombs told him, no honest Man, or any one who regarded their Character wou'd; from this Hall fell into a sort of Melanchollyness, finding no one would espouse his Cause, or be concern'd for him in any Shape whatever. The last Glance of Hopes was to make his Escape out of Goal, and for that End consulted his Bedfellow Cook, (to whose Account for Particulars refer the World) whose Case he looked upon as equally desperate with his own.</p>
            <p>Cook had no sooner the Hint given, than he gave his Assent, and ready Assistance to the Undertaking, and for that End sent for one Wood, (who now is confined) who Cook could intrust to assist them with Things necessary for their Design, which Things according to Cooke's Direction to the said Wood, were brought accordingly, which was a Brace of Pistols, Powder, Bullets, Flints, &amp;c. Spring-Saws, &amp;c. with the latter they intended on the Wednesday Night to have cut their Irons assunder, in readiness against the locking up next Night to pull off in a Minute, when by the Assistance of Wood on the Out-side to secure the Turnkey, and in Case of Resistance to shoot him.

            <p>The first Wife says that Hall kept her Company above three Years before he could prevail on her to have him, which when she did, was against her Will, finding his Temper in the Time of his Courtship to be surly, savage and inhumane; but as it was given out, he had 600 l. depending after the Death of his Father, which her Brother knew, forced her to marry him, with the Compassion she had for him from his often protesting and threatning, if she refused to marry him he would destroy himself, for which End he used to bring a Cord in his Pocket, and once in particular, when she lived in the P - of W - Laundry, as he and she were alone, upon her denying to have him he attempted to hang himself across a Beam which was in the Room to dry Clothes on; which coming to the Ears of her Mistress, she was turned away, soon after which she was married to him.</p>
            <p>He being then (as he all his Life time was) stingy, niggardly, and mean spirited, allowed her little or nothing to live on; she understanding Washing, took to that Business, and amongst her Customers was a Taylor, who by often visiting her became a Moth in the Eye of Hall, who took all Opportunities to watch his coming, and was so strict over his Wife, as to look her up off Nights, take Home the Key of her Room Door, and confine her thus</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174109140017"/>
            <p>till such Time as he thought proper to come next Day to release her. The said Taylor coming one Night after the Door was locked, insisted upon breaking it open being in Liquor, and accordingly did; she being undressed; the Taylor had no sooner entered the Room, than in came Hall, who seized him, and would have murd'red him, had he not been prevented by his Wife, and another Man who came with Hall, in whose Custody Hall left the Taylor whilst he went for a Constable.</p>
            <p>The Taylor being too strong for his Guard got loose, and as he was coming out of the House met Hall at the Door, who pursued him in such a Hurry, that he ran with his Head directly into the Spokes of a Cart that was in the Street, by which means Hall secured him, and tore his Cloaths to Pieces, carried him before a Justice, who bound him over to the then next Quarter Sessions, to which he gave Bail. Hall in the Interim being advised to sue him at common Law, by which he might get great Damages; this Hall thro' his avaritious Disposition readily agreed too, which was accordingly brought to Justice before the Lord Chief Justice Lee at Guild-hall, when a Verdict was given for Hall, with three Guineas Damages and Costs of Suit.</p>
            <p>Hall from hence, whenever he came Home to his Wife, used to say little, but under a Pretence of playing together, would pinch, hugg, and squeeze her, till she used to be all over black, and sometimes would draw a Knife on her, make her down on her Knees to sware who had lain with her since he had; she once to prevent his killing her, forced herself when big with Child out of a two pair of Stairs Room and got from him, but at last he being so great a Brute, they agreed to part, and he was to allow her a Guinea a Quarter, which he never paid her, but soon married a second Wife.</p>
            <p>As I am in a few Hours to fall a Victim to public Justice, the World may naturally expect I should leave something behind me with Respect to my intended Escape.</p>
            <p>The first Person that hinted the Design to me, was <persName id="OA17410914n114-1">
                  <interp inst="OA17410914n114-1" type="gender" value="male"/>
                  <interp inst="OA17410914n114-1" type="surname" value="COOKE"/>
                  <interp inst="OA17410914n114-1" type="given" value="HENRY"/>Henry Cooke</persName>, who is under Condemnation for robbing Mr. Zachary. He told me it was no difficult Matter to set our selves at Liberty, and the next Morning I inform'd Mr. Cross, (who is a Prisoner for forging a Note on Mr. Hoare) of Cooke's Proposal. Cross told me, that himself and Cook had consulted together concerning it, and that he had a particular Friend, a very ingenious Man, who was a Blacksmith, and that he would send to him for Instruments necessary for the forwarding our Escapes. Accordingly he wrote a very long Letter with his own Hand to the Blacksmith, informing him, that some Tools were wanted for his Use.</p>
            <p>Sometime after I was committed to this Place, a Book, the greatest Part of which was entirely false, was publish'd against me, and by Cross's Assistance, I compiled another, which I design'd to publish in Answer to it. When this Proposal for an Escape was first mentioned to me, I told Cross and Cooke, if there was a Possibility of setting ourselves at Liberty without committing Murder, I would agree to it, otherwise I would not, for I was fearful of the Consequences that might follow, and unwilling to add to the Load of Guilt, which already lay so heavy on me. Cross said, he did not value it, and if he once got into the Street, he never would go into Newgate again alive, and at last, with some Importunity they got me to join with them in their Undertaking.</p>
            <p>Before this Project was put in Execution, Cross told me, that I must pay five Guineas for the Tools, which we were to use; I told</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA174109140018"/>
            <p>him, that as we were all to be equally concerned, I would pay only my Dividend of the Expence; Cross reply'd, he had no Money to put down, but however, that little Saw, which cut the Bazil of my Iron, and was found under my Bed was produced, and I believe it cost 6 or 7 s.</p>
            <p>After this, Cross asked me if I could produce any Person that would swear they saw my Master after he was supposed to be murder'd, for it would be of singular Service to me: I told him I could not, and upon that he told me he would do for me very easily, or Words to that Effect.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he wrote a Letter to one W &#8211; D - in Charles Court, near Princes-street, Leicester-fields, and when D- came, Cross told me there was one of the cleverest Men in England for that Business. I inform'd Deer of the Situation of my Case, and he was pleased to tell me he would certainly bring me off.</p>
            <p>After this D- came backwards and forwards to me three or four Times, and told me he had fix'd on two Men who should swear as I should require; that one of them was an Apothecary, that they were both Persons who would make a good Appearance, and whose Character would be supported. He likewise told me, that they should make an Affidavit before a Judge, and if that Affidavit was produced at my Trial, it would carry the same Weight as if the Evidences themselves personally appear'd, but he must have half a Guinea to treat them, and before they would do me any Service, they were determin'd to have 4 Guineas in Hand.</p>
            <p>Upon this I put 2 Guineas into Cross's Hands, and agreed to make them four when the Business should be concluded; but D- afterwards came to me, and desir'd me to let him have a rough Draught, to prepare a Breviate for my Defence, and at Cross's Desire I refused him.</p>
            <p>Afterwards D- informing me that no Judge was in Town, and till then my Affair could not be finish'd, I reasonably demanded the two Guineas which I had put into Cross's Hands, but he told me he expected them for the Trouble he had been at in giving me his Advice and Assistance. After this I don't remember that I saw D - any more, and it would have been much better for me had I never seen him at all, for since I have been under Confinement, I have through Cross's Insinuations, been bilk'd out of six or seven Guineas.</p>
            <p>This, as I am a dying Man, is the real Truth; and I have not omitted the most minute Thing, that a Man, in my unhappy Circumstances, can recollect: I shall only say this, that I never entertained the least Thought of attempting an Escape, till I was put upon it by Cross and his Accomplices.</p>
            <p>At the Time of my committing this Fact, for which I suffer, I was in so much Confusion, that in putting my Master's Body down the Bog-house, the Keys of his Bureau fell in likewise, and there I was obliged to leave 150 l. in Gold, two Bank Notes of 100 l. each, and some other valuable Effects, behind me. It may naturally be asked, whether after the Commission of a Fact of this Nature, (supposing I had escaped the Hand of Justice) I could ever expect to enjoy a quiet Mind? To that I answer, That a Man is sometimes prevailed on to do a Thing that must inevitably destroy his Peace whilst his Life lasts, through the Want of Thought and Consideration; but with Regret I must own, that since I have been under Confinement, I have not had any Uneasiness or Frights upon me, but when I have sat up late, I have slept two or three Hours exceeding well, and have been too little troubled with the Shocks of a guilty Conscience.</p>

            <p>" I Beg the Favour of you to send me the " Original Papers you have of mine: I " would not have you make any Excuse, and " say that you have destroyed them, or used " them as waste Paper; if you do, you will " prejudice yourself much more than you " have already done, and think you have taken such unadvised Steps of late, which " you will have great Cause to Repent " of.</p>
            <p>" Besides, you and your Accomplices have " made a very great Property of me, as you " make it your Business to do of all unfortunate People, who are so unhappy as to " come under your Directions.</p>

            <p>Loving Brother,</p>
            <p>" IT is no small Addition to my present Afflictions, to hear of the great Concern " that you in particular are under for my Misfortunes, I am very sorry that I should be the " Occasion of giving you so much Uneasiness, " as also the Trouble it must be to the whole " Family, and others my Friends and Acquaintance; but you may satisfy yourself, " that none but the ignorant will in the least " reflect on you for my Misconduct and unhappy Fate. I would not have troubled " you with this long and melancholy Account, " but that I naturally imagine it will be more " Satisfaction to you to have it from my own " Hand, then from the common News-Papers, which are generally very imperfect.</p>
            <p>" Friday, the 28th of Aug. last, I was called " to the Bar at the <placeName id="OA17410914-geo-118">

Notwithstanding which by " some vile Woman swearing falsly against " her, her Life was almost in as great Danger " as mine, and Justice Deveil would have " committed her to Newgate, had she not " found Friends to give 500 l. Bail for her " Appearance at the ensuing Sessions.</p>
            <p>" This cruel Treatment, together with the " great Trouble she was in before on my Account, (and knowing her own Conscience " to be quite clear of what was, or possibly " could be alledged against her relating to her " being privy to the Murder) took such Effect " on her, that had she been obliged to appear " in Court, and tried for what she knew nothing of, it was much to be feared whether " it wou'd not have proved the Death of her, " had not she been cast for her Life, which in " all Probability she would, had it not been in " my Power to have clear'd her, which was " more then, than any Mortal living knew " except myself.</p>
            <p>" Such false Witness ought to be deem'd " guilty of Murder, the same as any one who " murders another by open Violence, (as you " may find it set forth at large in the Tenth " Chapter of the Whole Duty of Man) This " single Evidence upon the Account of the " bloody Linnen, which she swore she saw my " Wife bring out of <placeName id="OA17410914-geo-119">

            <p>day the 18th of June last, at four o'Clock " in the Morning, might have been the Occasion of taking away two Lives, and both innocent, for all she knew at that Time, as I " said before.</p>
            <p>" A Relation of my Master's who seem'd " inclined to speak in Favour of this Woman, " by saying, that he was inform'd there was another Woman of my Wife's Acquaintance " in the Neighbourhood, one Mrs. B - " who was very much like my Wife, and that " the poor Woman might be mistaken, by " taking one for the other, which according to " my Apprehension is doing Mrs. B - the " greatest Injustice that possibly can be, for " admitting that she was taken for my Wife, " it must be positively charging her with bringing out the Linnen. To clear which beyond all manner of Doubt, I have since declar'd where I myself put both Coat and " Shirt, which have been found accordingly. " And now I leave the World to judge, what " Grounds any one can have to speak the least " in Vindication of the Person who swore against my Wife. My being so very particular and punctual in this Matter is not in " the least in Favour of myself, for I freely " own the Justice of my Sentence; but as I " have now only a few Hours longer to continue in this World, I think it my Duty to " do all that is in my Power to clear the innocent, and take the Guilt on myself. So " Dear Brother, the Lord protect you and " yours.</p>
            <p>I remain your loving Brother,</p>
