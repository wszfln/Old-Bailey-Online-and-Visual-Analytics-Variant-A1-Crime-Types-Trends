            <p>Morning of Execution.</p>
            <p>On visiting the prisoners, about half past six, I found them in a mind very suitable to their unhappy circumstances. Being asked how it was with them? they answered, Quite easy and resigned. Their irons being partly unloosed, we went into the little room adjoining the pressyard, to spend a little time with them in prayer; a very respectable and valuable young clergyman also attended, who prayed with, and exhorted them, in a moving and pathetic manner. After which we went up to chapel; but Devine who was of the Catholic persuasion, did not communicate with his fellow convict, Lovell; but, what was very remarkable in him, after the communion, he, by his own particular desire, came up, and joined in prayer, which was a matter of thankfulness to all present, giving thereby an opportunity of speaking freely to him, and that, 'tis hoped, with blessing to his foul.</p>
            <p>Service being over, we sung a suitable hymn, and once more recommended them to mercy, desiring them steadfastly to look to the Lord</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA177210140006"/>
            <p>Jesus Christ as crucified for them, he being the true and only sacrifice for sir.</p>
            <p>On speaking of the awful change they would shortly experience, Lovell again, (as he had often before done) confessed that his sentence was just; and that he had no other hope or dependence for pardon and salvation, but the death and merits of the Lord Jesus; and that he should die in peace with all men, freely forgiving the greatest enemy he had.</p>
            <p>I should not omit one circumstance of this poor unhappy convict's free and open confession of the little knowledge he had of religion: A worthy clergyman, who visited him while under sentence, speaking to him of the power and efficacy of the blood of Christ to wash away sins; he said, that he had scarce ever heard of Christ, for that he could neither read nor write. And when spoken to, before admitted to the Lord's table, he told me, he knew not what it meant. O shocking stupidity! Is it possible that such ignorance can so prevail in a christian country! How careful ought parents to be in training up their children in a true and saving knowledge of religion; which would be a great means of preserving them from falling into many vices of the present age, which the ignorant and unwary are daily rushing into.</p>
            <p>Prayers being ended, they went down from chapel, in order to be prepared, The sheriff&#8217;s officer soon came: Their irons being knocked off, they were haltered and pinioned, and put into one cart. They arrived at the place of execution a quarter before eleven, where we joined in prayer, recommending them to the mercy of God, Lovell informed me, that <persName id="OA17721014n23-1">

To carry on their illicit practices, with all the precaution he could, he sends them about the country to mark what houses were proper for their purposes, and then they, acquainting him, went and robbed the houses of what they could get. The first attempt of their alliance, was the robbery of Mr. Franks&#8217;s house two years ago, when Jones disposed of the effects to the above-mentioned Saunders.</p>
            <p>The next robbery of consequence, was committed at the house of Mr. Grant, at <placeName id="OA17721014-geo-21">

And now being in the house, their business was to find what they could for their purpose. They soon perceived a box, which they immediately took into the garden to examine its contents; where they found a great quantity of plate, which they hid for that night, and left the box. Having fetched away the plate, they brought it to Saunders, and fold it to him at three shillings and six-pence an ounce. On their dividing the money, they shared fifty pounds each. He could not exactly tell me what number of ounces the plate consifted of, but I have been well informed</p>

            <p>by the loser of it, that there was near one thousand ounces. With this booty he lived well as long as the money lasted. Being short of money again he returns to his old trade, and where should he go to find something that would bring him money, but to Mr. Franks's house, where he had been successful before, and that he had never been discovered for it. For this purpose he appoints the two Brents to meet him near the place at such a time, and he would come to them. In the mean time he communicates, the affair to Sunderland, and asked him to go along with him, assuring him that as he knew the house perfectly well, he need not be afraid of its answering their journey, Sunderland at first seemed to refuse going, but as he told me that he had not a six-pence in his pocket at that time, necessity obliged him at last to comply - accordingly they met at the appointed place. Jones and the Brents, as they knew the house better than Sunderland, broke into it, while he kept a loot out: When they had finished their business, Jones and Sunderland came to <placeName id="OA17721014-geo-22">

            <p>They went to Saunders's, as usual, with the things, but when he came to know that they were brought from Mr. Franks&#8217;s house, he was afraid to meddle with them, and refused to buy them: Upon this they took the things to Sunderland's house, and Jones went and brought one Thomas there, and offered the things to him for sale; but he was disappointed in the end, for Thomas, under a pretence of buying them, went and brought with him some other persons, and by their assistance secured Jones and Sunderland, and took them before a justice.</p>
            <p>The fact was fully confirmed on the trial, and Jones, with Sunderland, was capitally convicted.</p>

            <p>Being of a free disposition, when he had any money he seldom wanted for a friend to drink with him; unhappily for him he fell into the company of one Hudson, who has not only been the ruin of Sunderland, but of many others also; and well would it be for him if this account should fall into his hands, and he would reflect a little, that he may avoid the same ignominious end.</p>
            <p>Hudson finding his new acquaintance of an easy temper, and that it did not require much trouble to persuade him to leave his business sometimes, and fit in the alehouse best part of the day, invited him to go one evening to a public house near <placeName id="OA17721014-geo-28">

            <p>Soon after a relation of his wife's died, and left her one hundred and thirty odd pounds, which he received - and now he thought that he might turn it to a good account, as the landlord did his where the club was held, near Fleet-market. He communicated his thoughts to Hudson, who immediately tells him, that if he would take a public house he would bring the club there - and that he and some others would lodge in his house.</p>
            <p>With these pleasing prospects of gain, and being rendered incapable of following his business constantly, by reason of his lameness, and not willing to live on the spend, he looked out for one.

            <p>In this manner he went on, and he thought that he might as well go out of a night with them, as well as to harbour them, and be a sharer of their spoils.</p>
            <p>The first night he went out was with Thumper to rob a house in <placeName id="OA17721014-geo-31">

            <p>Here it was that he became acquainted with Jones; but he, like Jones, could not keep his house long. The club returned to their former house, and he was obliged to become a member of it.</p>
            <p>His circumstances now being desperate he thought of nothing but of getting money where he could; and knowing that that person who had taken his house had by him some money, he tells Thumper of it, who well knowing the house, easily broke into it, and took away between thirty and forty pounds.</p>
            <p>He owned the circumstances of Mr. Franks's robbery, excepting that Durant had sworn falsly in saying that he had told him, &#8220;that he was the first person that entered the room," whereas he never was in the house, but stood without to keep a look-out, and that he never saw the house before in his life, neither did he know where he was going to when Jones called on him; but this he knew, that he was going to break into some gentleman's house.</p>
            <p>The robberies that had been committed about Hatton-garden, Coldbath-fields, and Purpool-lane, he told me were committed by Thumper; and Mr. Franks&#8217;s robbery was the greatest that he had ever been concerned in, and for that he shared fifty shillings, being part of the money that Jones brought out of the house.</p>
            <p>The behaviour of this convict was such as became his unhappy situation, and he gave all diligence and attention to the instructions given him. He was quite open in his answers to every question that was put to him. He lamented much that the world looked upon him as the worst of villains, when he knew himself not deserving of that reproach.</p>
            <p>He acknowledged that he had kept bad company, and that law had doomed him to suffer for this offence justly.</p>
            <p>Before the report of the convicts was made, he fell sick, and was confined to his cell. What he further related, and the manner of his latter behaviour, is made known to the public on the morning of his execution. He was 45 years of age.</p>

He said No, for I was in bed at his mother's house at the time it was done. These being the material accounts that he gave me, it will now be necessary to mention his behaviour: And it was such as became his condition. He shewed at all times sincere marks of repentance, and was very willing to be instructed in his duty. He constantly attended the chapel, and behaved with seriousness and devotion. He acknowledged that his sentence was just, and he sincerely and heartily forgave every one. He was admitted to the Lord&#8217;s table with Jones and Sunderland on Sunday the 11th, where he wept, and prayed that God for Christ's sake would forgive him. He was 43 years of age.</p>

His master dying, he was left to shift for himself; but as he had served some part of his time, he was able to get his bread, and supported himself. Soon after he married, and having a young family, and being at that time out of work, he was led to commit the robbery. Being desired to tell if he had committed any other, he said, &#8220;No, sir, nor did I ever keep company with, or knew any one that did go out a robbing, that was my first and last fact; nor have I done any thing of the kind since I came over, but have worked hard to maintain my family.Being told that he should have staid abroad his time, he answered, "That he had heard that his wife and children were in the parish work house, and he thought that if he came over, he could work in the country, and send for his wife and children, and nobody would find him out." He said that he came over last March, and did work in the country, and lived with his family. But, unfortunately for him, he came to London to see a friend on some business, and going to drink with him at a public house, a man came in that knew him, who immediately gave information of him, and he was taken up.</p>

            <p>MORNING OF EXECUTION. OCTOBER 14, 1772.</p>
            <p>THE prisoners were brought down from their cells about a quarter before seven. Their behaviour was every way becoming their unhappy situation.</p>
            <p>The appearance of Sunderland and Jones was really moving and affecting by reason of their late illness of a bad fever, of which Sunderland was never expected to have recovered: He was so weak and low that he could scarcely support himself.</p>
            <p>Chapman, while his irons were unloosing, said, &#8216;Ah! these will soon fall to the lot of some poor unhappy fellow!' Sunderland and Jones were not fettered, the low and sickly condition they were in not requiring it.</p>
            <p>Being now ready they went up to chapel, except Creamer, who was of the Catholic persuasion: Sunderland went up first: it was a few minutes before Jones and Chapman followed. In this short interval of time Sunderland said, 'O how cold am I! I am now as cold as I have been lately hot and distracted with a fever, when I was so light-headed, that nothing run in my mind but a respite was come down, and wondered at their keeping me in my cells. Once upon a time little did I think of coming to this untimely end!&#8217;</p>
            <p>When Jones came up (who had occasion to wait a little behind) he, with a very decent and christian-like behaviour, fell on his knees to ask God's blessing.</p>
            <p>After being severalty spoken to and prayed with, they were admitted to the Lord's table, of which they partook, 'tis hoped, to their everlasting comfort.</p>
            <p>They were then again recommended in prayer to the mercy of Christ; desiring them stedfastly to look to him as crucified for them, and to be sensible that their sentence was just, but that he, the innocent and immaculate Lamb of God, suffered, the Just for the unjust, and was treated with the greatest shame and ignominy, to take away their curse. They were once more reminded to look unto him, and to let nothing, that</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA177210140015"/>
            <p>might pass on their way, divert their attention from him.</p>
            <p>The clock striking eight, Sunderland listed up his hands and said, &#8220;We have not three hours more to live in this world.&#8221;</p>
            <p>Service being ended, they went down from chapel to be made ready. Creamer, while the halter was fixing about him, wrung his hands and wept bitterly, and said, at going out, &#8220;God forgive them that have taken away my life for returning back to my own country!&#8221;</p>
            <p>They arrived at the place of execution at half past ten; and when tied up, I went to perform the last office to them. They behaved with decency. And having again acknowledged that their sentence was just, except Creamer, who thought it rather hard, as he had committed no robbery since his return; but he was told to remember, that he had deserved to die before, and had received mercy: "True, says he, it is so; well, God forgive every one."</p>
            <p>They were once more recommended in prayer to the mercy of God, and then soon were turned off, crying out, Lord, receive our spirits.</p>

            <p>POSTSCRIPT.</p>
            <p>THE melancholy view afforded us of the dreadful catastrophes of the unhappy persons who have been the subject of the foregoing account, lead us, in pity to the rising generation, to offer a few reflections to the public in general, which we hope may prove a means to stem the torrent of immorality and vice, by which multitudes of the unwary, and especially our thoughtless youth, are brought their untimely end.</p>
            <p>First. It is highly incumbent on parents, if they have a proper tenderness for their offspring, to spare no pains for the education of their children; and when they have learnt to read, to prevent their reading such</p>
            <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="OA177210140016"/>
            <p>obscene books as tend to inflame their minds with lewd ideas, which are the fore-runners of vicious practices. It is also their duty as they prize their eternal welfare, to instruct them in the principles of the Protestant religion, and, by their good examples and exhortations, to produce in them, at all opportunities, a delight in such ways as lead to sobriety, industry, and regularity, as well as to enforce their precepts by all suitable encouragements and rewards - Such a conduct, as is not only highly consistent with their duty, but likewise greatly promotive of the happiness of posterity, and its salutary effects will undoubtedly cause the children yet unborn to applaud and bless them.</p>
            <p>Secondly. What an inundation of wickedness and misery would be prevented, if the masters in this great and populous city would keep a watchful eye over the youth committed to their care, by restraining them from the use of such liberties as are productive of the most pernicious consequences to others! Young people, from a vain affection of their own importance, are too frequently desirous of associating indiscriminately with profane and immoral persons, especially such as multitudes of the public houses in this extensive metropolis abound with, where their natural propensity to vice occasions them to be unthinkingly carried down its lethiserous stream, until ruin overtakes them, and they are cut off from society at a time when they might, by sober and moral behaviour, become useful members of it. It is therefore earnestly recommended to all masters and mistresses, as they will shortly give an account at the awful bar, to oblige the servants under their care to keep strict and regular hours at night, to attend the public worship on Sundays, and to prevent, by all possible means, their keeping such company as contribute to corrupt and deprave their morals.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It were much to be wished, for the benefit of the community, that the houses of dissipation and riot as harbour the vicious of both sexes, and are interspersed in various places as traps to ensnare the incautious, were suppressed; for it is notorious, that great numbers of those unhappy youths who have ended their days at the gallows, have dated their ruin, either from their connection with bad women, who patrole the streets in crouds, as is in defiance of all authority both human and divine, or else in those receptacles of debauchery and villany, which, by searing the conscience, train up numbers of youth of both sexes in the paths of wickedness and destruction.</p>
            <p>It is therefore hoped these few hints will induce all such as have the guardianship of young people, to use their utmost efforts by example, admonition, and the power they are invested with, to guide and preserve them in that track of sobriery and virtue, which alone is capable of procuring solid felicity to themselves, their dependents, and in general.</p>
            <p>FINIS.</p>
