                  </hi>. I am assistant to Thomas Benjamin Sowerby, of Grosvenor Row, Pimlico, a pawnbroker. On 9th March, the prisoner Emily came, and offered me this locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) in pledge, and asked 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I asked her if it was gold; she said, "Yes, the best gold," or, "the best of gold; it was given to me by an old sweetheart, before I was married"—on that repre<lb/>sentation, and her appearance being respectable, I took it for gold, according to her word, and lent her 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I had never seen her before—on 22d March, she brought this locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), with a piece of tape on, it exactly corresponding with the other, and asked me 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it—I said, "Is this the one you brought before?" she said "Yes, it is the same one; I have no other; I redeemed it"—on that representation, I lent her 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; I should not have done so if she had not represented it as the same—on 9th April, she presented me with this locket (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), told me that it was the same one which she had pledged before, which I understood to mean the first, and asked for 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on it, which I lent her—on 23d April, I saw her again; she pro<lb/>duced another locket, similar to those I have produced, and I said, "Is this the same one that you have always pledged?" she said, "Yes," and repeated that it was given to her by an old sweetheart—I asked her if she had</p>

               <p>redeemed it; she said, "Yes," but not having delivered it to her myself, and supposing she had pledged it two or three times previously, I directed a search to be made, and found these three lockets—I said, "How do you account for this?" she said, "I do not care; it is my own"—I said, "You had better give me some account of yourself; how did you become possessed of them?" she said, "I shall not tell you anything about them"—I sent for a constable, and she was going to rush out of the shop, but I caught her by the arm outside—she tore my face with her nails—a constable came, and I gave her into custody—after the first hearing at the Police Court, I tried the first and second lockets; the first was base metal, there was two or three grains of gold in one part of it, and that of the commonest description, 25<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. an ounce; there is not above 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of gold in it, but as a locket it would probably be worth 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they are all of the same value, and each has a piece of black ribbon to it.</p>

I was requested by Hall to test this locket (<hi rend="italic">One offered in pledge on 23d April</hi>)—I found it to be composed of two portions of gold—(pawn<lb/>brokers do not test articles in front, as it destroys their value)—it weighed 2 dwts. 12 grains, with the box and glass, about two grains of which were fine gold; the gold, including the gilding, was worth 5 1/4 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—if the locket was 15-carat gold, it would be worth about a half guinea—I have offered to make these lockets at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. each, if I have a quantity to do, and they would be sold at about a half crown—this is worth about 16<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., to sell at a pawnbrokers' auction, but I would not offer it it pledge.</p>

               <p>it is always alloyed; you could make one of fine gold, but it would be very soft—if made in India, it would be made of fine gold; but, in this country, we ask whether it is to be 12, 13, 14, or 15-carat—these are made for the purpose of deception; this dome is carried round underneath; if I take the box out, and scrape the centre, it proves that that part is not plated, and therefore I should conclude that the other parts are not plated—in making these brooches, I should put just as much gold in as I was ordered to put—if you will allow me a light, I can tell you what proportion of gold there is; it will fall to pieces with the slightest heat—(<hi rend="italic">The witness withdrew to make the experiment.</hi>)</p>

I ask you to take bail for my wife; Lord Campbell has decided that this is no offence in law, and if you knew your duty, you would not take such a charge"—I said, "I cannot take bail in such a case; it is not a bailable offence, as far as I am concerned, but if you apply to-morrow to the Magistrate he has power, and no doubt he will take it"—he said, "I am the manufacturer of these lockets; I prepared them, and I sent my wife to pledge them"—next day the female prisoner was taken before the Magis<lb/>trate, at Westminster Police Court—there was a remand, and on the second examination I saw the male prisoner in Court, and, finding that the Magistrate intended to remand the case, he said, "She is my wife, I acknowledge I sent her to pledge these lockets, what is the use of keeping her?"—the Ma<lb/>gistrate said, "I think, after that, you had better take him into custody"—I directed him to be taken, and he was charged at the station on three different charges, but no other charge than Mr. Sowerby's had then been entered into—I entered the charges on the charge sheet, and told him he was charged with obtaining money from Mr. Sowerby, Mr. Leach, and Mr. Edwards, by false and fraudulent pretences, by sending or causing to be sent spurious lockets—he said, "I admit it; I am the manufacturer, it is my trade; I have sent my wife to pledge them, and it has been decided that it is not an offence in law, but I deny that I sent her with a fraudulent intention"—(<hi rend="smallCaps">THE RECORDER</hi>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Mr. David Swaefe, of No. 9, Bishopsgate Street; he is a tobacconist. The prisoner has been a customer at the shop—on Friday, 11th June, he came, about half past 12 o'clock; he asked for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of cigars, and Mr. Swaefe's son served him—I did not see him served; I came into the shop about half past 12 o'clock, and saw him sitting smoking a cigar on a stool by the side of the counter—shortly afterwards I went to hang up my coat, and I saw Rogers in the back room, watching—in consequence of what he said, I watched—I commanded a view of the prisoner; I saw him take one cigar from between the box and the counter case, and put it into his left hand trousers pocket—I went up to him, and said, "You ought to be ashamed of yourself coming here as a friend and a customer, and stealing cigars;" he said, "What do you mean?"—I said, "All the time you have been sitting here, you have been taking cigars"—I sent for Mr. Swaefe, and told him, in the prisoner's presence, what had happened—the prisoner did not say anything then; at the station, he spoke about paying—Rogers went and brought a policeman, and the prisoner was taken to the station.</p>

It is my duty to enter all cheques brought from the clearing house with the initials B, C, and D—those are my letters—this is the book—I find an entry in it in my handwriting of a cheques for 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., on 18th Dec., 1857, drawn by W. Carrington—the entry is W. Carrington, 1,200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I enter them from the drafts themselves, and then give them to the ledger keeper—the prisoner was ledger keeper that day—to the best of my knowledge I have never seen the draft since—they are afterwards called over to me by another clerk by the amounts, but not the names.</p>

The prisoner is my husband; we have been separated very nearly four years—on Monday, 14th June, about 10 o'clock at night, I was standing in Earl Street, talking to my daughter-in-law, and saw my husband in the middle of the road, coming with his face towards me; I endeavoured to avoid him, by walking away—he came across the road, on to the pavement, overtook me, and took hold of me by the shoulder very heavily—he said something, and I said, "Do not take hold of me so brutish; you will find you have a wrong one to deal with"—he then took hold of me very lightly; then he repeated my words—he then took hold of me again, with a very strong grasp, on the same shoulder, saying, "I do not care for your protection," and struck me a blow on the neck with his right hand, which I think was clenched—I put up my left hand, and found blood coming from a wound in my throat—I struggled very slightly with him, and fell—I believe he then walked away; I do not know anything more—I was picked up, and taken to a surgeon's, and then to Charing Cross Hospital, where I have been ever since.</p>

Shortly after 10 o'clock, on the night of 14th June, I was talking to a friend, at the corner of Earl Street and West Street, which commands a view of both West Street and Earl Street, I heard a rush by my side; I turned round, and saw the prisoner push a woman against the gutter of the public house, close to where I was standing—I cannot swear to the woman, for I did not observe her particularly—the prisoner then put his right leg back, and stood like this, and deliberately his arm went twice towards the woman; whether he struck her or not, I cannot tell—his arm was going in this direction, as if he was stooping partly—I cannot say against what part of her his arm would have gone, because she was fixed against the shutter, and appeared to be trying to slide down—I can positively assert that be struck her; he appeared to strike her twice, and she sank on the pavement, and I heard a kind of a groan or a cry—I was as close as I am to you, rather closer; I only had to turn my head round—the prisoner walked slowly round into West Street; I walked directly after him, as close as I could keep to him—I heard a person cry, "A woman is stabbed!"—I immediately took hold of the prisoner, and</p>

I have lately resigned—on that evening, about half past 10 o'clock, Mrs. Dobson was brought there—she was seen by the surgeon in the hospital the same evening, and I examined her the following morning, and found her in a very debilitated state—she had a punctured wound in the centre of the collar bone, on the right side; it extended directly backwards; it was three or four inches deep, and about an inch wide, penetrating to the blade bone; it bled considerably—it most have been given with considerable violence with this instrument—this knife might have inflicted it—the point was stopped by the bone—she was in a very alarming state for two or three days—she had lost a good deal of blood—the danger was from the amount of fever—the wound must have been given from before, backwards; I mean, a thrust forwards.</p>

On 16th June, at a little after 6 o'clock, the deceased was brought there—I examined him; he had a compound fracture of the left leg, close to the ankle—he died on the 28th June, of the shock to the constitution; he was over seventy years of age; his left leg was cut close to the ankle—what I have heard of in the evidence would produce what I saw.</p>

(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), and presented it for payment with this letter—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Bull and Mouth, June 10th, 1858.

Williams")—I noticed the endorsement at that time—it had the appearance of having been recently written; it looked fainter than the writing of the body of the cheque, and evidently a piece of blotting paper had been passed over it, directly it was written; it was fainter than it is now—the prisoner's hand trembled, as he gave me the cheque, and my suspicion was at once aroused—he spoke as he came into the bank; he said, "Good morning"—I told him, that I knew nothing of Mr. Smith; we had no account, in his name, in the bank—he appeared very much surprised, and said that he could not understand it—he said, "Is it not a funny thing for a man to draw a cheque on a bank, when he has no account?"—I told him that it was occasionally done—he asked me, if it would be any good to call again; I told him yes, as there was a second post at half past 2 o'clock—I forget whether I told him the time; but I know I told him that there was a second post—he then asked me to write my answer on the cheque, and I wrote, "No account"—he said, "I received it in Lincoln's Inn Fields yesterday," but did not mention any name—he appeared very reluctant to leave the office, and I suppose he remained there four or five minutes—he appeared to be thinking, and seemed con<lb/>fused; he looked on the ground—I saw him again, as I was crossing the road to communicate with the inspector; I had hardly opened the advices—he</p>

               <p>did not come to the bank again that day, but, about two minutes after he left, I saw him walking towards the Eight Bells—I had opened one letter before he came in; that was the bead office letter, from the parent office in London—after he had gone, I opened other letters; this is one of them—(<hi rend="italic">Read:</hi> "Cranbrook, June, 1858.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When the notes were abstracted from the bank parcel, brought by you from the London and Westminster Bank, did you not endeavour to fix the stigma of the guilty act upon me? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes, a few days after the notes were stolen, they were returned to the house of one of the partners, tied to the knocker of the door; I took no active steps to prove you guilty of it—we expressed our opinion that you were guilty of it—that is twelve or thirteen years since—you were retained in the London and County Bank for some few weeks afterward; I do not know for how long—nobody proceeded against you—you are half brother to my late wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In investigating the affairs of my father's bank and property, as executor, did I not discover and accuse you and your brother of acting fraudulently in respect of that property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know anything about it—I have no recollection of such a thing—I know nothing of any such transaction—you did not charge me with it on any occasion, to the best of my knowledge; you had no occasion to do so—I offered no obstruction to you as executor of the estate—I never interfered with your duties as executor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that the property was not absorbed in accommo<lb/>dation bill transaction between your brother, Isaac Beaman, who is now in difficulties in the Borough, and yourself? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; no such thing; there were no accommodation bills relating to your father's estate—your father sent hops to my brother, who is a hop factor, and he drew bills on the hops, nothing beyond that; they were all real transactions.</p>

Howe, I have broken my arm; I am done"—the next moment my wife said, "She has got a knife," and she took hold of her left hand, and the back of her hair, and I took the knife from her right hand—she said, if it was twenty years hence she would do for him; she did not care if she went to the gallows for him.</p>

On the morning of 25th May, I went to the station in Pratt Street, between 1 and 2 o'clock; I saw this cash box there, and, in consequence of what Martin said, I went to Mrs. Rayment, and got a key from her; I opened the box, and found what was in it; I found a cheque in it, and went to the King's Cross station; I went with a sergeant of the railway to the coal office; I examined the doors; both the doors were fast; the sergeant called up Bryant; he came and opened the outer door of the coal office with a key that was in the lodge—there was no appearance whatever of violence about the door—I went up stairs; I found there an iron safe, with the doors wide open; a large cash box was in it—after that Bryant left, and came back with the prisoner, who said that the lock must have been picked—I observed that it was one of Chubb's locks, and it was not very easy to pick them—I asked the prisoner what was gone, and he named a quantity of gold and silver, and some notes, and a cash box; he did name the sum, but I did not put it down at the moment; it was 239<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I think, in gold, about 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, and about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver; he said it was in the safe; he said the gold and silver was in bags, and there was some money in a cash box—there was a cash box in the safe, which was a great deal larger than this one which was found—this is the one that was left in the safe (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>;) this was locked—I examined the window of the coal office; I did not find any trace whatever of any person having come in at the window—I found a good many more papers on the desk by the windows; they appeared as if nothing had been disturbed—it had been a very boisterous night, but it was not then so windy as it had been—some of those papers were near the windows; there was nothing at all on them to keep them from being blown about—I mentioned that I thought it must be done by daylight, and the prisoner said that could not have been, for he did not leave till half past 9 o'clock—he produced the key of the safe; he tried the key himself; it locked and unlocked it very easily; there was no appearance whatever of the lock having been tampered with—he produced the key from his pocket.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the messenger in the coal department of the railway. I live at a cottage next to the coal office—the premises are entered by large folding gates, from St. Pancras Road—I have a lodge, in which I am night and day—the large folding gates are closed at night, about 9 o'clock—if any one came after that, the policeman at the lodge would answer—the policeman is not at my lodge; he has a box to himself; he is there all night—there is not a small gate; persons come in at the great gates—I remember the night of this robbery, 24th May—I was in my lodge that night—I was in bed when this took place; I went to bed about half past 9 o'clock—the name of the policeman on duty is Allistone; he had not come; the other policeman, Cox, who is relieved by Allistone, had not left when I went to bed—they usually change at 6 o'clock, but there was an excursion that day—on the monring of the 25th, I was called by Sergeant Edwards, about 3 o'clock; I saw Alli<lb/>stone there—I procured the key of the coal office from Allistone's box; that is where it is usually kept—it was the habit of the prisoner, when he left, to hang up that key in that box—having obtained it, I went to the door of the coal office, and opened it with the key; it opened the lock readily in the usual way—I went up stairs with the policeman, and found the safe open, and robbed—I went and called the prisoner; he lodged with me; he was in bed—I told him what had occurred, and he came down to try hit key.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a clerk in the office of the Great Northern Railway Company. On the morning of the 25th, between 9 and 10 o'clock, the prisoner made a statement, before the general manager, of where he had been on the night of the robbery—I made some rongh notes of what passed—he said that he left that night about half-past 9 o'clock, rather earlier than usual, and placed the cash in the safe—this bag was shown him, and he said that it was the bag in which the money was put—he said that he left the premises about 10 o'clock or a few minutes before 10 o'clock, and went to see his doctor, Mr. Taylor, in the New Road; he could not tell the number, but it was between Mabledon Place and St. Pancras Church; that he was at home, and he saw him at a quarter past 10 o'clock; that he afterwards went to Burton Crescent to see some friends, whom he named, at a public house, not by appointment, he usually went there—he said that, on leaving the coal station, he went down Wharf Road, Brewer Street, and Skinner Street, into the New Road; that he was last in the office, and placed the last cash in the safe at half-past 9 o'clock, and then turned the gas off; that he carried the cash up himself from his drawers, and locked the safe; that the cash was in the leather bag produced—he produced the key of the leather bag and unlocked it; he said "This key is always attached to this bunch," which he produced—he said he always carried the keys with him as they were important he said he was positive he locked the safe, because there are two distinct operations in locking it—and that he had tried the door afterwards, and that he could not account for the door being unlocked—he said, "It looks very serious against me."</p>

                  </hi>. I am inspector of police on the Great Northern Railway. On 25th May, about 11 o'clock, I searched the prisoner's apartment at Coal Office Cottage—he was present, and it was done by his permission—I found this great coat behind the door in the bedroom—I said, "Is this the coat you wore last night;" he said "Yes"—the coat was wet, and there was wet mud on one of the arms—I found a trunk there; the prisoner said "You will find gold in that trunk;" I said "How much;" he said he did not know—I said "I would rather you would name the amount"—he took</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Herbert Street, Hoxton; I am foreman to Messrs. Chubbs, locksmiths. On 26th May, I examined a safe, on the first floor of the office of the coal department of the Great Northern Railway—I took the lock off the safe—it was a lock of our firm's—there was not the least appearance of there having been any tampering with it—this is the key of the lock; I tried the lock with this key before taking it off; it went per<lb/>fectly easy—I then took the lock off; there was dust in it, and nothing but the mark of the radiation of the key; there was no other scratch or mark of any kind—if that lock had been opened, it must have been by one of the real keys, or by a fac simile key.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Might one be made from an impression of it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I defy the best workmen in London to make a key from that impression—I recollect the circumstance of the South Eastern gold dust robbery, but those locks were only what we call tumbler locks; this is a detector lock—those were common working locks, made to stand all sorts of work—in that case, the key that opened the lock was made from an impression, but they were different locks to this—I do not think a key of this lock could be made from an impression—go to the best workman, and give him the best impression that you can possibly take, and I do not think he could make a key that would open it—I do not say that it is absolutely impossible—the cuts in the tumblers of the lock are made so minute, that the impression in wax would not do; if one tumbler is risen up, there is not room for a sheet of writing paper; a gentle<lb/>man tried it by tying a hair round it, and the key would not pass the lock—we have very frequently to make keys, but we never undertake to make a key that will pass; if it does not pass, we say we will do it again; sometimes</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185807050039"/>
               <p>we are obliged to have the lock sent to us—we have tried to make keys from impressions; we frequently have impressions sent by post from different parts of the country; we have tried to make them, and they have almost invariably failed—we have succeeded—I do not say it is impossible to make one—I could not quote a single instance in which we have succeeded, but I believe we have done so—I have been foreman about ten years—I cannot form any idea of the number of times, because it is so rare.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> How long was he in the Company's service? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About five years—I have not borrowed money of him on my own account—for the purposes of the Company I have borrowed different amounts at different times, occasionally, as much as 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I think never more. I have not given him an I O U—I requested him in writing, to pay a certain sum out of his receipts, and he retained that till I paid him again—I paid him in cash, when I got a cheque from the Company cashed—he has never borrowed of me—I paid him after an interval of two or three days, or it might be five days, two days, generally.

It is a circuitous road, it is the practice of the office—if he had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay in, he could not pay in that order of mine to the company, they would not keep that as my order, they must have cash—I sometimes have borrowed of him every week, and sometimes not for a month—this has been done ever since the office has been open, it was known to the officials of the Company—I cannot say that it was known to the directors, it is not my business to make those inquiries—I imagine the persons under whom I act, know it; the person who was in the berth before me, did the same thing—I do not get a cheque from the Company for the exact amount I paid him—I send in an account for petty cash—I should send in an account of what I had expended; as soon as I had received the cheque, I should have to pay 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to the prisoner, but, the account would not contain a statement of my being indebted to the prisoner, 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. only my own disbursement.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">GIFFARD</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this borrowing system done in secret? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No. I never borrowed except by directions in writing, and these directions would be in the prisoner's possession till he settled with me the next time. It is possible that he may have been unable to balance his account, by reason of his lending me these sums, if the carmen had not arrived in sufficient time—I would not take that written statement as money, I should have the money—he kept the written statements in his possession till I paid him the money—he would then return them to me and I tear them up.</p>

On 29th June, I was on duty in Rupert Street, St. James's, about midnight, I saw three men coming up Oxendon Street together, Jones and Griffiths are two of them—Jones fell rather behind the other two, and went to the door of No. 33, Oxenden Street—he put one hand at the top, and the other at the bottom of the door, and forced it, as if testing whether it was bolted or not—Griffiths and the other man walked to the corner of Coventry Street, turned round on their heels, and looked round—Jones then joined them, and went back to the side door of No. 27, Coventry Street, which is in Oxenden Street, and is Mr. Stocker's, where he did the same to the door—I crossed over, Griffiths and the other man walked away, and Jones followed close behind—I said to Jones, "What did you do at that door in Oxendon Street?" he said, "Me?" I said, "Yes;" he said, "I was not at any door in Oxenden Street"—the other two separated, one went into a public house, and Griffiths stepped off the kerb into the carriage way, I then observed something under his coat, under his arm—I went up to him, touched his coat, and said, "What have you got here?" he said, "I have got a bag"—I said, "What are you going to do with a bag at this time of night?" he said, "I am going to take it home"—I took it from under his coat, and it was this sack (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I touched him on the breast pocket, and heard the <hi rend="italic">jink</hi> of a key—I said, "What</p>

               <p>have you got here?" he said, "That is my latch key"—I put my hand into his pocket, and took out these nine keys (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>), two of which are skeletons, two door keys, and a common box key—Jones was then walking off in the direction of Princes Street, and I called on Joy, a policeman, to seize him—the man who went into the public house I believe to be Tarry, by his dress and appearance, but am not positive—I went to the station with the prisoners—Griffiths said that he was a locksmith, which was the reason he had the keys—I asked him whose employ he was in, or where he served his time; he said, "Oh, I picked it up"—I asked his address, he said, "No. 9, Wilson Street, Long Acre"—I went there, but there was no such number—Jones gave his address No. 6, Duke's Court, I went there and ascertained that Jones and Griffiths are brothers.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a commercial traveller of No. 7, Belinda Terrace, Canonbury. Last Saturday, 3d July, I was in Bishopsgate Street, about a quarter or twenty minutes past 8 o'clock—I took a cab opposite Bishopsgate Church, and told the cabman to drive me to No. 7, Belinda Cottages—three or four minutes before that I had met Mr. Day, and he gave me a sovereign; I gave it to the cabman through the trap door, and asked him to get it changed, and give me the difference—Mr. Day was not in the cab when I got in, but he got in two or three minutes afterwards—the cabman drove to a public house in Acorn Street, 150 or 200 yards from where I got in, he went in, and came out and said, "I shall not drive you any farther, you only gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—at that time a policeman came up, and my friend Day—I said I gave you a sovereign, and I shall give you in custody—I said, "Give me my sovereign, that I gave you to get change"—he denied it, and said that I had only given him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., but I had not 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in my pocket.</p>

I met Mr. Morgan in Bishopsgate Street, I was standing at the door of Mr. Case, the tobacconist, when he passed by—I gave him a sovereign, put him into a Hansom's cab, closed the door and the cab drove off—I was rather in a hurry to save my train from Shoreditch, but I saw the cab pass me, and I saw Mr. Morgan's hand pass through the top of the cab and saw the cabman take something of him; a man behind me said, "Your friend has given the cabman a sovereign"—the cab drove round Acorn Street, and I saw a crowd assembling, I went up and said in the prisoner's presence, "Where is the sovereign I gave you;" he said I gave it to the cabman to change, and he will not give it me back, and will not drive any further—"I demanded it of the cabman, and he refused to give it up"—I asked him for his ticket and he refused it—I saw his number on the back of the cab, and then he gave me his ticket—a policeman then came and took him—having only just time to save my train I ran away; the prisoner said, "I have not received any money at all—Acorn Street is only about 200 yards from where he got in, or I could not have overtaken the cab.</p>

I am a clerk in the engineers' office at the Eastern Counties Railway—on 11th June, by direction of Mr. Brooks, a principal in the office, I packed up seventy-four half sovereigns, and 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in silver, which I directed, as a value parcel, to Somer Layton, in Suffolk, and gave it to Keeble, one of our servants, between 4 and 5 o'clock in the evening, with certain directions—besides the letter, a pay sheet of wages was in it—it was for the purpose of paying men in Suffolk—the prisoner was in the service of the company, as parcels porter, at the Stratford station; he had a desk in which to take care of value parcels, the key of which was in his custody—any parcel delivered to him, he ought to enter in this book (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>), which he keeps for that purpose—here is no entry, on 11th June, of the parcel of which I have given a description—some of these entries are in the prisoner's writing—there are several entries in other people's writing—I should say that the entries, of 11th June, are all his writing, but I am not sufficiently acquainted with his writing to swear it—all on 11th June are in the same writing—I should say, that this "Sinclair" is in the same writing as the three above it, but done with a different pen.</p>

                  </hi>. I am employed by the Eastern Counties Railway Com<lb/>pany, at Stratford. On Friday evening, 11th June, between 4 and 5 o'clock, I received a parcel from Mr. Scott, with directions; I went to the parcels' office, where it is the prisoner's duty to be, but did not find him there—I gave the parcel to Mancer, the boy under him, who signed a receipt in a book for it—the parcel was directed, "Station master, Somer Layton, value, O. S.," for "On service."</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

                  </hi>. I am parcels' lad at Stratford, under Dales. I have been in the company's service nearly five years—it is the prisoner's duty to be at the parcels' office, and mine also—it was my duty to receive parcels in his absence, and on his return, I gave the value parcels to him; I do not know where it was his duty to place them—he had the key of the desk, which he still kept when he was absent—on Friday evening, 11th June, I received a value parcel from Keebles; Dales was not then at his office—he returned in about an hour, and I followed him into his office, took it out of my pocket, and gave it to him, and he took the key out of his pocket, and put it into the desk, which he locked up, and said, "All right"—it had on it, "Value parcel, Somer Layton"—I signed a book when I received it from Keeble—I have seen this book in the prisoner's possession; the entries in it are for the most part his; I know his writing well—he sometimes kept it on his desk, and sometimes locked up in his desk—when he received a parcel, it was his duty to enter it in this book—these four entries, on 11th June, are his writing—here are some entries of mine in the book; about one in twenty are mine, and the other nineteen are all the prisoner's—no one but he and I had any right to make entries in this book—on Tuesday, 15th June, I heard them say in Dales' presence, at Mr. Brook's office, the locomotive department, that there was a value parcel missing; there was a conversation about it, and Dale said that I might have given it to him, he did not recollect—I am quite sure I did give it to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is not that book sometimes kept in the window of the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes, anybody could see it—the office door is usually open to the clerks and porters—there are a great many porters at Stratford, they would sometimes go into Dales' office to make inquiries—it is my duty to make an entry in this book when I get a value parcel—I did not make any entry when I got this parcel—I had received orders from Dales to enter them as soon as I received them—I did not do that on this occasion, but put the parcel in my pocket, it was there about an hour—I was walking about, some<lb/>times in the station, and sometimes in the office; the office is sometimes left without either of us, but the door is shut and locked—it is sometimes left open</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185807050054"/>
               <p>when I am employed on my other work; it was my duty to forward this par<lb/>cel by the next train—Dales was absent about an hour—the 6. 20 and 7. 40 trains convey parcels to Somer Layton—there would be none before 6. 20, after I received the parcel. I come to work at 9 o'clock in the morning, and remain till half-past 9 o'clock; my wages are 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week. When we are both away, the key of the desk hangs in the ticket office—the night inspector and the porter are there at night, and six or seven more in the day time—the key hangs against the desk, I hang it up there, and Dales who is there first, gets it in the morning—I am never there before him, he comes to meet the Parliamentary train at a quarter to 7 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What key are you talking about, the key of the desk, or the key of the office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> The key of the office; the desk key was always kept by Dales—I cannot recollect whether the key was in the desk when I received the parcel from Keeble; in ordinary business, when I saw the book, I should make the entry; if I had seen the book I should have made it then.</p>

                  </hi>. I am station master at Somer Layton. In the course of my business, I ought to have received a parcel with money, to pay the men's wages on 11th June; I did not receive it; it was the duty of the guard of the train to deliver it to me—the train would arrive at Somer Layton at a quarter before 6 o'clock—it would take from four to six hours to get there from Stratford—if it had been sent there that night, I could not have received it till next morning—if a train left Stratford at twenty minutes past 6 o'clock, it would arrive, in the ordinary course, at half past 10 o'clock next morning—there is no train by which I could receive it between half past 6 o'clock and the next morning.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Are there a good many people employed about the ticket office? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; during the day time, but all the ticket clerks leave at a quarter to 10 o'clock, when the last train comes—other people than the ticket clerks go into that office in the day; some of the public find their way in sometimes to make inquiries—the station is sometimes very much crowded in the day, but not often after 10 o'clock at night—I never missed any parcels, but two years ago, two boxes were taken off the platform—Dales leaves his work at a quarter to 10 o'clock, generally, and comes at a quarter to 7 o'clock in the morning, but not always—his wages are 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a week—he came to his work as usual, and I saw no change in his manner after this; he is sober and attends to his duties—I never heard any complaint of losing any parcel before—he is not married.</p>

My duty is to be stationed at Bishopsgate, to take anything that may arise on the whole line—on 15th June, an investigation was going on in London, about a lost parcel, and Dales was called in, when he made a statement—it was in the engineers' office, at Stratford—Mr. Brooks and Mancer were present—I investigated the case, and said to Dales, the parcel now is traced into your possession—Sidney Keeble says that he gave it to Mancer, and Mancer says he handed it to you; I saw you put it in your desk and say all right; what have you to say to that—he said, "I did not mean to say I did not have it, but I do not know where it has gone to"—I went to his lodgings with him, but found nothing there—we have a train to Somer Layton, stopping at Stratford from 10.37 in the morning—parcels which would be forwarded from Stratford to Somer Layton would be sent on by the 6.10 or 7.40 train to Broxbourne, and they there would be signed for—the 8.40 train from London does not stop at Stratford—the only stopping train, from 3.13 to 6.10, is the 5.20 from London; but at that time the parcel was in Mancer's charge, and had not been given to Dales.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a chair maker, of No. 26, Brunswick Street, Blackfriars Road. I have known the defendant some years—On Sunday afternoon, 28th March, I left my house about ten minutes to 10 o'clock—I put two sovereigns in one pocket, and one shilling in the other; on my way I met the defendant (I had previously purchased some tobacco); his brother Charles was with him; we had a quart of beer, which I paid for with fourpence in copper; I had paid 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the tobacco, which left me 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the beer, left me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and the two sovereigns—I went to his house at his invitation, and two persons named Clewley, father and son, came in—we all had some beer there—the defendant asked me to lend him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the work which I wag going to give him to do (some turning)—I did so; that was before I went to his house; that was all the silver I had—when we got to the house, Clewley sent out for some beer; they had clubbed together a few halfpence—I wanted to get home to my dinner, and Clewley said, "Shall we have a drop before we go?" I said, "I do not mind;" and said to Johnson, "Just get a half pint of gin," and put down a sovereign on the table—he took it up, went out with his brother, and stopped away nearly two hours—when he came back he brought the gin—I asked him for the change, as he did not offer to give it; he said, "What change?" I said, "The change out of the sovereign;" he said, "You only gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—I said, "I saw it was a sovereign when I put it down on the table;" he said, "No; you only gave me 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.;" he then pretended not to know what he was doing, and appeared to get more drunk—Clewley asked him whether he was going to give the change; he said, "No"—Clewley said, "It is a very bad thing of you, the poor man cannot afford to lose a sovereign;" Johnson said, "No, I am not going"—Clewley said, "I saw Mr. Quinton put down the sovereign, and saw you pick it up"—I fetched a policeman; Clewley went away first—his brother Charles came back with him when he brought the gin—the inspector at the station refused to receive the charge—I afterwards went before a Magistrate; the defendant appeared, and the Magistrate said that it was a very dishonest action, and very near a felony,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="185807050060"/>
               <p>and told me, if he did not pay me, to summon him to the County Court, and I would get my money—I took out a summons; I was too late the first time, on account of my work, and took out another—I gave my evidence, and Johnson swore that I only gave him 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and that he brought a half pint of gin, which was 8<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth of tobacco, and left 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. on the bottle—I heard the Judge caution him; he repeated the same statement afterwards; I have not seen him since; he has not spoken to me at all.</p>

I think—no one sent for more after that, only the half pint of gin; it was about an hour from the time I went to the defendant's to the time I sent for the gin—it was a little after 5 o'clock when he came back; they were all present when I gave the sovereign—Johnson's daughter was not there, she was there at first, but she went out, and I did not see her come in again, she was outside—I did not take my share of the liquor, I would not touch it, because I was so vexed, but I took my share of the beer—Clewley, the son, is here, the one who was sent for at the County Court; the father was there likewise—it is not a very large room—I did not see that any of the party were a little the worse for liquor at the time the gin was sent for—I gave the defendant in custody about an hour after he returned, he pretended to be the worse for liquor, I do not know whether he was shamming or not—I was too late the first time at the County Court, and I was too late here last Session, the Grand Jury were discharged—no one has given the defendant notice to appear here to my knowledge—the Magistrate dismissed the charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Windmill, in Wyndham road, Cam<lb/>berwell. On the 28th June, I was there, and saw the prisoners enter together, about half past 10 o'clock at night, and Jones, who now gives the name of Nunn, asked for a half quartern of gin; I served him, and he gave me a crown; I gave him a half crown, two shillings, and fourpence in coppers; he put the change in his pocket—Warren was with him—Jones then said, "You seem very short of t sixpences, will you give me two sixpences for a shilling?" I did not look at it, but gave him two sixpences, and put the shilling in the till; he and Warren then left together—I am perfectly sure that the change I gave Jones was good, because I took it out of some parti<lb/>cular silver—the prisoners returned in about five minutes; they came in together, and Jones asked me for a pint of porter; he gave me in payment a good half crown—I gave him two shillings, and fourpence in copper—they drank about one-third of the beer, and then he said, "You seem very short of sixpences, give me two more sixpences"—I saw him looking at the money in his hand; he gave me a shilling, and, having my suspicions, I tried it, and it was bad—when I found it was bad, I went to the till, and found another bad shil<lb/>ling (there were other shillings there)—when I found that, I said, "It is too bad to pass two upon me in one night; I shall certainly give you in custody;" Jones said, "If that is the case, I am off," and he ran off as soon as he could—I jumped over the counter, and looked out, but could not see anything of him—I saw the constable on the other side of the road—Warren had not left the house; he did not attempt to leave; he was taken into custody; he resisted very much; we were obliged to have another constable to search him at the bar—I gave the constable the shilling that Jones gave me, and the one that I took out of the till.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a greengrocer's shop, at No. 7, Waterloo Road. On Saturday, 12th June, the prisoner came, between 10 and 11 o'clock at night—she asked for half a peck of peas; I served her, and she gave me in payment a shilling—I was about looking at the shilling; a bunch of turnips laid there, and she asked me how I sold them, and said she would have 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. worth; that drew my attention from the shilling, and I put it into my pocket—I had not sufficient coppers to give change, and I sent the boy for 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. worth of coppers—theprisoner seemed very anxious to get away, and she had 1lb. of potatoes—I still had not sufficient change, but a neighbour came in, and I got from her 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>., which I gave the prisoner, and she went away—directly afterwards I found the shilling she had given me was bad—I put it by itself in the cupboard, away from other moneys—On Monday night, the 14th, the prisoner came again, just after I had lighted the gas, about half past 9 o'clock—she asked for a quart of gooseberries—I knew her before I went out to serve her—Iserved her, and she tendered me another shilling; I found it was bad—I told her so, and that I had got the one that she gave me on the Saturday night—she at first denied having been there on Saturday night, but I told her she had, and I enumerated the articles she had had, peas, turnips, and potatoes—shethen owned to purchasing half a peck of peas—a constable came up, and I gave her into custody, and gave him the two shillings.</p>
