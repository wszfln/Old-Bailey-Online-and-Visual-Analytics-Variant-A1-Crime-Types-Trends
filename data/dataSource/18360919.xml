               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury,—I cannot offer to address you upon a case, the facts of which admit of no doubt, without at the same time, expressing to you, in the outset, my apology for having subjected you to the trouble of hearing the formal proofs to establish it. I was aware, gentlemen, it must be established—indeed, I have never denied the accusation; and it was my full intention to have saved my Lord and yourselves the pain of recording a verdict which would subject your fellow-being to the forfeiture of his life; and my feelings, moreover, influenced me in coming to that determination, from the desire I had to spare my relations and friends (which are many and near) the in<lb/>creased misery that must arise to, and befall them, from a complete investi<lb/>gation and disclosure of all the circumstances connected with the act itself. It has been by the direction of my legal advisers that I have taken my present course; but for them, I should have pleaded "Guilty" to the charge: but I found, if I did so, that I should be precluded from address<lb/>ing you, and thereby shut out from giving you and the world some expla<lb/>nation of the causes which led me to the committal of such a crime, and thus of impressing upon your minds that necessity, and not inclination, in<lb/>stigated it; which, though a poor one, has afforded me some consolation, I am fully aware that necessity is no legal excuse for error; but Gentle<lb/>men, it is not to be forgotten, that so constituted is man, that he cannot be perfect, and that, but for human imperfection, legal and social restraints would be altogether unnecessary. Few men have philosophy enough to suffer disgrace, when the means, either real or imaginary, are in their power to avert it—particularly if they suppose those means can be used without injury to others. I was thus placed; my pecuniary difficulties were immense; their non-settlement must have plunged me into a prison; my professional avocations must not only have been suspended, but my pros<lb/>pects of advancement, by the loss of my conncexions, must have been de<lb/>stroyed; my poor unhappy wife—yes, I have indeed a wife, and an infant child too—must have shared my ruin; and the days of my poor, aged, and venerable parent must have been shortened. Great as these accumulated misfortunes would have been to one brought up as I was, in the bosom of a large, united, and respected family, and in the enjoyment of their devoted affections, they would not have induced me to commit an act, had I con<lb/>ceived injury to any one, much less to a beloved brother, would have followed. My firm intention and design was to have replaced the stock—and this assertion and assurance I make in the presence of my God, who can bear my conscience witness as to its truth. I proved also, by payment from time to time the amount of the dividends to my brother's credit, at his banker's, that it was a temporary use only I was making of the money, If I had intended the act as one of dishonesty, I should not have con<lb/>tinued daily in my office, for a period of seven moths, transacting my business—should I not have flown with the £7000. and sought refuge and security in a foreign land? Gentlemen, I did not only not fly with the money, while undiscovered for seven months, but I remained also for days</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190008"/>
               <p>after suspicion arose, and then again after the discovery was fully made which, if it were necessary, could be testified. Gentlemen, the mind of a man, steeled by the love of crime, looks to his life and liberty when either are in danger—I looked, although I now perceive through a false medium, to the sustaining of character—I did this act with the sole view of sustain<lb/>ing my character—by the discovery my character was blasted, and the protection of my person was no longer with me a consideration—I flew not—I submitted to be taken. The details which led to my embarrass<lb/>ments, and those which would show the application of the money I ob<lb/>tained, would occupy a time in elucidation which I should be unwarranted in trespassing upon; but I will, with your leave, give you some general heads, which will show you the sincerity of my assertion, that it was necessity, and an anxiety to sustain my character, which prompted me. I was admitted an attorney in the year 1830, having served my clerkship, and been brought up and educated in the country—on my admission, I com<lb/>menced business in London—I entered into partnership, and had reason to expect that the business would be prosperous and lucrative. In this full confidence much capital was embarked in it, and, for the purpose of acquir<lb/>ing a good business, some expense was incurred for the purpose of main<lb/>taining that respectability of appearance without which business con<lb/>nexions do not acquire confidence. My partnership was unfortunate, to the extent of about £1500, my losses otherwise considerable, and I found, in time, my expenditure overbalance my income: besides which, I lost by the insolvency of a friend, for whom I had become security, nearly £600 and this at a period I could least sustain it, which involved me in further difficulties, and in order to meet them, or at least in a great measure, I obtained advances from my father; but my shame and backwardness to discover the real, the whole state of my case, prevented a kind and indul<lb/>gent parent, like a misled physician, the opportunity of effecting a perfect cure, by entirely extricating me, which his liberality of disposition would have inclined him to do, had he know the whole truth. My hops of being able to disengage myself from what remained caused this reserve—this disinclination to tell all—this want of candour; but those hopes proved false—my remaining difficulties I warded off until my own means might be sufficient to meet them, by giving notes and bills; when these became due I was unable to honour them—renewals took place, and upon those renewals being again dishonoured, proceedings at law were takes and judgment obtained, which to satisfy, I was obliged from time to time to borrow money, and give fresh securities and large premiums, until at length, in the latter end of the last year, I found myself in debt to the extent of nearly £5000—all brought on by accumulated pecu<lb/>niary difficulties, arising, not from any extravagance of living, or the com<lb/>mission of any excesses; but purely from struggling against the stream, to keep up that professional respectability which I considered indispensable—a very great proportion of this debt being, in fact, accumulated by the pur<lb/>chase of pecuniary accommodation. Had I not so miscalculated, but sub<lb/>mitted at once to misfortune, I should have averted this my present more serious calamity. In 1832 my brother was married, and a sum of money was invested in the purchase of Consols, to the amount of £7000 and up<lb/>wards. Mr. Watkins, Mr. Fountaine, and myself, were the trustees. On account of my being resident in London, I was in the habit of receiving the dividends for some time. My brother went abroad, and it was arranged that, during his absence, his bankers should receive and place them to his account; and, for this purpose, a power of attorney was given to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190009"/>
               <p>bankers by the trustees, myself being one. The bankers continued to act upon this power till July, 1835; and before the following January divi<lb/>dend became due, my pecuniary difficulties had become so great, so insur<lb/>mountable that my mind was in a state of distraction, and my bodily health also suffered in consequence, and which brought forth the continued observations of all my friends; and it having been suggested to me that the discount trade was very lucrative, and that if I had capital I could realize a handsome income, and in a short time an independence, and my own individual unhappy experience in the rate of profit that might he so realized, confirmed the truth of the suggestion; I conceived the plan of appropriating my brother's money for a time, thus to extricate myself, and with the residue to commence the discount trade, in order to replace the stock. I do assure you. Gentlemen, that, at that moment, my infatuation was so great, by the false confidence I had in my ability to carry on the new line of business, that I anticipated a very large return of capital, in a comparatively short time, so as to replace the stock; and that in the interval I should be able to continue the payment of the dividends punc<lb/>tually. I had not then the least conception that the Bank of England could suffer, or had any thing to do with the money; but that its being in my name, though with others, it was a family matter, and that I could satisfy my brother, on his return to England, that, in what I had done, I had merely acted from temporary pressure, and that when he should be con<lb/>vinced—as I fully expected to be able to convince him—of my ability to replace the stock, he would be fully satisfied. How lamentably I was deceived, the result has shown. Having obtained the money, I at once discharged my then present debts on bills and judgments, amounting (together with the accumulations of interest, and compound interest, and heavy premium for accommodation, together with costs upon divers of the debts) to upwards of £4700. My business debt, and several old partner<lb/>ship accounts, I paid to upwards of £100, and in the months of Decem<lb/>ber, January, and February, I discounted nearly thirty bills, varying each in amount from £50 to £250, and making together a sum of nearly £2000. Thus I show, without calculating my contingent expenses, or my household expenses, (which, by the prudence and good management of a discreet and affectionate, but now unhappy, wife, were very small,) a disposition of nearly £7000 within three months. Promptly were the premiums paid for the discounts, and I was silly enough to imagine that those who paid for dis<lb/>counts would pay bills punctually, which is only another proof of my want of experience in business, and false confidence in my own abilities; and, consequently, with the cash I received for bills which were really good I discounted fresh ones. The £7080 odd which I realized by the stock, together with the premiums I received, and the small sum of 144<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. which was received from my law business during seven months, and which is proof of the very depressed state in which it was, were the means by which I made the outlay; so that when I was taken into custody, I was almost without a pound. If, my Lord and Gentlemen, I had obtained this money for the love of plunder, I could not stand before you, and hope for your commiseration; but fallen as I am in my own estimation, and fallen also as I must be in yours, still I do with confidence look to your humanity to bear patiently with me, while I detail to you this story of human infirmity. My means but not my objects were unjust—my intention was to pay my debts honestly, to keep up my respectability, to avoid a gaol and disgrace, and to</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190010"/>
               <p>replace, by my exertions, my brother's property; and the best proof I can give of my intentions having ultimately been to replace the stock is, the fact of my having paid into the hands of my brother's bankers, to his ac<lb/>count, the amount of the tow half-yearly dividends, as they became due in January and July of this year, amounting together to nearly £240. My brother is aware—he is convinced, that my intention was to replace the stock, and my distress is only the more intense, as I know his kind heart bleeds by my disgrace. Of the Bank of England I feel it my duty to speak—to that body I feel very grateful for the kind manner in which they consented, when I was first taken up, to allow me as much time as possi<lb/>ble before trial. In prosecuting this case, they have acted, no doubt from a sense of public duty—and I have no right to indeed I do not, complain—I am only anxious to convince your Lordship, and you, Gentlemen, as also the Bank, that while I am not denying the facts, I am sincere is assuring you that a fraud on the Bank was never contemplated by me he the remotest degree, that I was actuated by no dishonest motives, and my firm intention was re-investment. Do not let it be here supposed, for a moment, that I would by any explanation of my motives, seek to justify the criminal act—this is not my desire—this I know to be impossible—I too well know that improper means are not justified by the end, and that the act itself, whatever the intention, the result remains the same in the sight of God and man. The distracted state of mind I have suffered—the days and nights I have spent in anxiety, tormented by agonizing thoughts, by the stings of a self-accusing conscience, by the but too well founded fears of undergoing the sentence of an earthly tribunal—and above all, the still greater dread of being perchance suddenly cut off in the midst of my sins, and suffering, unprepared, the more awful sentence of the Great Judge of all—these sensations, I say, would have been more than sufficient to convince me of this fact, had it required any argument or proof to do so the only desire I have, is to impress upon your minds that no fraudulent design, or dishonest motive, instigated the act; and I confidently trust, that from the facts now laid before you, and the arguments adduced, you do feel convinced of this circumstance. This address has been unavoidably long, and its imperfections I hope will be attributed to the agitation of mind I feel, and the awful situation in which I stand. Could I have addressed you by my Counsel, no doubt the statement which is that imperfectly conveyed to you, would have been more clear, and the peculiar circumstances which actuated me, would have been in stronger and more powerful terms argued and reasoned upon, so as to have thoroughly con<lb/>vinced you, that in action only, and not in motive, I was blamable—I am in this matter (as my fate has been in all others) unfortunate—for a few days' delay, I believe, would have given me the privilege and advan<lb/>tage of that legal assistance which, by law, I am not now entitled to have In the full confidence, however, that you, my Lord and Gentlemen, will make all allowances for my feelings and manner, and that you will, not with<lb/>standing the verdict which must pass against me, accompany that verdict with such a recommendation of mercy as my peculiar situation and cir<lb/>cumstances induced me to crave of you; I will conclude my address in few words. I earnestly entreat you to consider well before you decide upon the fate of a fellow-creature—let your best feelings come forth and have some weight in your determination—forget not that I have a wife, a poor unhappy partner, in misery, who is innocent of my offence; aye, and remained utterly ignorant of it, as well as every circumstance connected</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183609190011"/>
               <p>with it, and the extreme difficulties which drove me to it, until after my capture, when she was suddenly, and without warning, plunged into wretchedness. Forget not that upon your verdict, in a measure, depends whether she remains a wife or become a widow—whether my infant, my innocent child, is to become fatherless—bear in your minds also, and engrave it upon you hearts, that I have two respected and venerated parents, one of whom may be looked upon, from illness and afflictions, as almost on the verge of time and eternity, and that the downfall of his un<lb/>happy son might, indeed, be the means of hastening his death—of bringing his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave—Oh! add not to my sin and suffering this agonizing reflection—think that these unhappy parents, as well as a family, which has ever been highly esteemed and beloved, and a large circle of relations, are anxiously and painfully waiting your recommendation—think on all this, I implore you, and act not till you have thought. I resign myself into your hands, and may that great and merciful God who governeth all things and all men, who ordereth the thoughts and actions of his creatures, and maketh them subservient to his will, possess your hearts with a feeling of mercy for the wretched individual whose fate is now in your hands, and who pleads for mercy at the door of your hearts.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor and live at No. 17, Argyle-street, in the parish of St. James, Westminster. On the night of the 10th of Au<lb/>gust I went to bed at eleven o'clock precisely and was the last person up—I make it my business every night before going to bed to see all the doors and windows, safe and I saw the house fastened up in every way that night—I was disturbed about a quarter after twelve o'clock—my wife made an observation to me about the creaking of the street-door—she got out of bed, came back to me, and alarmed me—I ran down stairs in my shirt, and on the first fight of stairs I noticed that the street-door was about a quarter of a yard open—I ran to the street-door and opened it quite, and saw a lad running round the corner of Argyle-street into Ox<lb/>ford-street—I</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Castle public-house, in Broadway, in the parish of St. Margaret, Westminster. On Friday evening, the 16th of September, I was at home—we shut up the shutters an half-past eleven o'clock; and at twenty minutes or a quarter to twelve o'clock I myself shut the street door and fastened it—the other persons in the house had gone to bed—there are four tills in the bar—one of them was entirely empty; in another there was sixpence in silver and a few half-pence; in another, a shilling, and sixpence, and a few halfpence; and in the last, one half-crown, three shillings, one sixpence, some fourpenny-pieces and a few coppers—I cannot speak to the exact number of the fourpenny pieces—it is always my custom to examine my tills every night before I go to bed—there was 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in penny pieces, all done up in 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. packages, on the side-board in the bar, with 18<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in penny pieces, not done up—there was a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief on the left-hand side in the side-board drawer—after seeing every thing secure, and the house fastened, I went to bed—I was awoke about half-past four o'clock, or rather later, the following morning, by the police—there is a back door to my house, leading into a small yard, and that back door leads into the parlour, which has a door from it into the bar—I found both those doors open—they appeared to have been opened by violence—a pannel was taken out of the back door—on looking about, I missed all the money from the ma<lb/>tel-piece, the side-board, and all the tills, and the blue pocket-handker<lb/>chief—I know both of the prisoner—I had seen Davis in the house about four o'clock both afternoon, when I went out to come into the City—I had seen Lucas many times at my house, but do not recollect seeing him there that duty day—I accompanied the policeman into the back, yard, and found a ladder there, placed against the wall—that would enable persons to pass from the yard of the next house over the wall into yard—I afterwards accompanied the policeman to the station-house—I have since seen the blue cotton handkerchief, and believe it to mine—it is like the rest of my handkerchief—I also saw some money, with a number of fourpenny-pieces among it.</p>

I was coming past the same place, and found nine packages of penny-pieces in five-shilling parcels in a privy, in St. Herman's-hill, tied up in a blue pocket handkerchief—Coller was with me—the prisoners had come past that place at ten minutes after twelve o'clock—I look them into custody in the Almonry, about half-past four o'clock as I suspected them—I had heard nothing from Coller—he was gone to see if any rob<lb/>bery had been committed—I took the prisoner to the station-house—I found nothing on Lucas—in Davis left-hand waistcoat pocket I found thirteen fourpenny-pieces, and amongst them was the one which Mrs. Cleg<lb/>gett identified just now—I also found half-crown, four shillings, three sixpences, and a halfpenny, on him.</p>

I am as in<lb/>nocent as any living man. When he was lying down, two brewer came and rolled about several tubs of beer, and moved him; and he lays that to me.</p>

On the 27th of August I was in the kitchen, and saw the prisoner in the street—he stooped down and took something from the corner of the kitchen, which was open—I looked up—he put something into his pockets out of both hands, then turned away, and walked up the street—he returned in about a quar<lb/>ter of an hour, and walked by the door—he then stooped and took another pair of shoes, which my father saw—a woman came and gave my father notice—he was secured, and two pairs of shoes found in his possession—he gave up one pair—the policeman asked where the other pair was—he said, in his pocket, and gave them to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I reside at Greenock, in Scotland, and am a merchant. On the 10th of August, about twelve o'clock, I went to St. James's Park to see the palace—the prisoner Cummings came up to me, and told me he was a merchant from Newcastle—he asked if I was a stranger—I told him I was, and that I came there to see the Palace—he said he had got all his busi<lb/>ness done—that the merchants here did their business soon, and he was wait<lb/>ing for a vessel coming into the pool, and he expected to make a handsome sum of it, as he had the first offer—we walked about for an hour, or an hour and a half, and then he asked me to go and take a drink of porter, (it is not possible I can be mistaken in the person, because these two men were with me in the house and there was no other person with me,) I have no doubt of them—I had drank nothing then—I went with Cummings to a</p>

               <p>public-house near the Park—he called for a bottle of porter—we were only a short time there, when Baseke came in—he seated himself right oppo<lb/>site on the other side or the same table—he began telling a story about his family—that his father was dead, and his elder brother had taken possession of the property, and left him and his sister destitute—he said he was at service at 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and he gave part to give his sister schooling, and the people of the village, in Lancashire, told him that his brother was born before his father was married, and he had got the property that day or the day before—he had got 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of it of the lawyer—he proposed to give each of us 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to give to the poor, or do what we liked with—I said I had a little money with me; but Cummings said he had 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., or about that, at his lodgings—I did not say what I had—then this <hi rend="italic">laird</hi>, (the man that had the money,) went to another house—we came through the Park again, and came to another house, and dressed a beef-steak—this <hi rend="italic">laird</hi> paid for that—we drank a bottle of port wine—the laird paid for it—then each of us put our money out—we had been home before we had the beef-streak—I lodge in the Minories—we got one of the little <hi rend="italic">cabs</hi>, and Cummings went to the Belle Sauvage to take his money out—I went to the Minories, when I got home, I took my pocket-book, which contained forty-one sovereigns and a half-sovereign, and one Scotch note for 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I was taken in by that fellow—he told me he drove one of the best gigs in Newcastle, and had 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a year—I met Cummings at the Belle Sauvage, and Baseke was at the door—we had shifted a house or two, because they wanted to go into some low house, and I would not go but into a respecta<lb/>ble house—it was about four o'clock when we took the beef and port, and then Cummings showed some notes that he had—they were rolled up in a piece of paper, and what money I had was put on the table, and rolled up in a piece of paper and the note—Baseke had 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in notes, which he had shown us long before that, I believe—I did not examine them—then I put mine into my pocket, rolled up, and Cummings was to put a second piece or paper round it; and he made me pull out my watch—he put it down under my watch—the <hi rend="italic">laird</hi> (Baseke) then went away to buy some cigars, and then Cummings left me before I could look round—I was satisfied I had my money; and when I was going to bed I found I had got two shillings' worth of halfpence instead of it—I gave information to the policeman next morning, and after that they were taken—I was at a loss to know them at first, but the waiter having so completely described them, I was certain these are the persons.</p>

               <p>after that I had my doubts—I went to the policeman—I could not give any description of the two men—I was fetched by a policeman down to Greenwich, to be examined before the Magistrate—the policeman told me on the way that he was going to show me the men who had robbed me—he said, "The two men that are taken on suspicion"—I went down expecting to see the two men that are taken on suspicion"—I went first to the watch-house—let Baseke hold out his right hand, I will tell you by his fore-finger, it is crushed in some way—I never said any thing to any one about the finger—I think I saw something remarkable in one of them hands at the watch-house—I really cannot charge my memory—I did not ask to look at his hand—I took a note of it in my mind—no one had told me about this man's finger—I saw it myself the first day I was with him—I did not give that description to the policeman—he was better acquainted with the man than I was—I said I could give no description; but every thing does not occur to a person at one time—it would appear I said no<lb/>thing of it before the Magistrate—I might not think of it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Aldersgate-street. Between eight and nine o'clock on the 15th of September, I had a pocket-handkerchief in my right-hand skirt pocket—I felt a hand in my pocket, and I grasped it—it was the prisoner's—he was so determined to have it, that when he pulled his hand out he had the handkerchief in it—he drew his hand out, and two men took it of him, and threatened to rescue him—I said, "If any body will hold the boy, I will attack you both."</p>

I lived fellow-servant with the prisoner—on Sunday, the 20th of August, the prisoner, came to my room about eight o'clock in the evening—I was in bed—he sat on the bed—my wife came into the room, and he then asked me if I would have some beer—I said I did not mind if I did—he proposed that my wife should fetch some, and gave her 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>—as soon as she left the room he locked the door—my wife rattled the door and came in, and said there was some secrecy going on, and he would know what it was before she left—the prisoner said it was no consequences; he had got a little money sent to him and he wanted to have it counted—with that, he went and fetched the beer himself—when he came back he took the money out of his hat—it was silver, wrapped in something, I cannot say what—he and I counted it on the table—here was above 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and the greater part sixpences—he said, "I have some gold yet, and turned that out of his pocket—after counting the silver, it was put up in paper parcels, of 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each—he was going to tie the papers with a handkerchief—my wife said she would give him a bag, and they were put into the bag—after that he produced some gold from his breeches pocket, wrapped in a piece of cloth or rag—that was counted, and was above 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—he tied that up in the cloth again, and put it into his pocket—he said, "I am going out of town; I have got some tickets, and will leave them with you "—I said, "It is of no use your leaving them with me; I have some of my own I do not know what to do with"—he said, "I will leave you some money to get them out with; "and he left me 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver—I asked when he should be back—he said he did not know; he should be sure to find out where I was, and would call on us—my wife asked where he got the money from—he said "Don't trouble about that I had it sent me"—my wife wished me to have nothing to do with it; but he said, "Nonsense! I tell you I had the money sent me"—he then left the room, and I saw no more of him—I delivered the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. which he gave me to Mr. Bennett, on the Wednesday; but I told him of it on the Monday evening, and said he could have it them.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep the Sawyer's Arms Marylebone-lane. On Sunday evening the 20th of August about ten o'clock the prisoner came to me, and asked if I wanted any silver—I said I did not—I never saw him before—he went out, and about half and hour afterwards walked into the tap-room—the waiter took him pint to ale, and brought me 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—in five or ten minutes the waiter came and said something to me and brought me 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. of silver, wrapped in pieces of newspaper—I gave him sovereigns, for it—after the prisoner drank the ale, in about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, he, and another person whom I never saw before, walked out—about ten minutes after, the prisoner returned and asked if I wanted any more silver, I that said, I did not; I had changed him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. before, but if he wished for any more gold, I did not mind taking 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more of him—I took 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in shillings, and 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in sixpences, and gave him one sovereigns and two half-sovereigns—he afterwards pulled out a bag, and was counting out 60<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold on the counter—I looked at him—he counted it out in 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. parcels—I saw six parcels of gold, which appeared 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each, and he asked me to give him ten sovereigns for 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in silver, and he would</p>

On Wednesday, the 31st of August I was in the tap room of the Rosemary Branch, at Islington, and saw the prisoner sitting in the tap-room drinking—he went form the tap-room to where they clean the pots, and returned in two or three minutes with a quart pot under his arm—it was wrapped up in something—I told Williamson and he went after him and brought a quart pot back, and placed it on the tap-room table—he went a second time and brought two pints and one quart back with him, and put them in the place where they clean the pots. <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi>

I know Prendergast, he is not a man of good character—I gave evidence where he was summarily convicted before the Magistrate, and he appealed against the conviction, which was confirmed—I have known him several times in custody on suspicion of felony—I have known him nearly twenty years—I recollect George Alderson having him in custody one, and his being in the custody of Clements and had two months.</p>

                  </hi>. I am shopman to Lawrence Kennedy, of Shadwell, a pawnbroker. On Wednesday, the 24th of August, between seven and eight o'clock, the prisoner was in my shop—I missed some shawls and the next morning, one red and one green—the prisoner came and offered the green shawl to pledge the same morning—I had a private mark in ink on the corner—I can swear that none of my shopmen sold it—I have one besides my self and the boy—I asked where she got it—she said she had bought it of me last Saturday, and gave 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for it—that would be the selling price—I then taxed her with stealing it—she said she had not stolen it—she had not bought it of me, but it was lent her buy another woman, and if I would allow her to go she would fetch her—I allowed her to go, and she came back again and said she was gone, and would come presently—Mrs. Eeles told me she had the red shawl—when she came back I asked her where the red shawl was—she said has had left it at home—I gave her into custody.</p>

On the night of Friday, the 19th of August, I went to the theatre, and afterwards went with some friends to supper at Hemming's, in the Piazza, Covent-garden—I had three sovereigns, two £10 bank-notes, and one country note for £10—I stayed there two or three hours, till two or three o'clock—by that time I had taken a little too much, and instead of going home I took an opposite direction, and went to the east end of the town—I had not much recollec<lb/>tion of any thing till I was locked up in Lambeth-street; but when I was properly in my senses, I found myself before the Magistrate, and this money was all gone, and there was one £5 note left to full suspicion—when I recovered, I found I had a £5 note that was new to me—the three £10 notes were gone, and the two or three sovereigns—I had received these £10 notes from Drummond's, at Charing-cross—I can swear to the numbers of the notes which which have been traced—they correspond with the numbers which one of the clerks gave me at the banking-house—there is no clerk here.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the sister of the last witness. I live with my father and mother at Ely—I was with my sister at Cambridge in July—I saw Feaks at the Little Rose after I had been at my sister's about a fort<lb/>night, and I asked him if he had a parcel from my mother—he said no, he had not, and he said he had got situations for me and my sister—he said my sister's was a nurse-maid's, but he did not know what mine was—it was in the Borough—nothing was said about going to London then—we went the following week, and he said, "Are you ready to go?"—I said "No, we cannot go this week, but will go next"—that was at the same time—next Thursday we took our things up, but the wagon had not get in, and we waited, and when it came we put our boxes in—we waited which he baited the horses, then got in, and came off to London—we arrived at the One Swan, in Bishopsgate-street, about half-past four o'clock on Saturday morning—we staid there till nine o'clock, and asked if the good lady was coming—Feaks said, "Yes, I have sent the porter for her"—Mrs. Jones came by herself—she said she was the person who wanted the two servants—we were coming down the yard—Pettit, the porter, was with her, and he said, "These are the two young girls"—Feaks then came across the road to us—he did not say any thing—he and the porter went away—Mrs. Jones then ordered a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, and the porter to put the boxes into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—he said, "The booking comes to 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>."—he put the boxes in, and Mrs. Jones, my sister, and myself went to No. 2, Lombard-court—Mrs. Jones paid the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-man, and the porter for the boxes—when we got in it seemed a respectable kitchen, all full of covers all about—she asked us to have break<lb/>fast, and said we had better lie down, for we must be tired with travelling on the road two nights—Feaks came there in about half an hour, and the porter with him, I believe—I did not hear them say any thing—I was not in the bar—went into the bar—I afterwards went and lay down—on Sunday Mrs. Jones took us out walking—on Monday she told me to go out walking, and showed me in and, out, and told me which way to go—I went and walked up and down Fleet-street—nothing took place that Mon<lb/>day—on Tuesday I was walking down Fleet-street, and a gentleman fol<lb/>lowed me into the house—Mrs. Jones told us to go up stairs—she went up with us, and took 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for the room—the gentleman ordered some negus for us to drink, and then he wanted me to go on the bed—I resisted, and would not—there was a sofa in the room, and * * * * * * *—after that he got up, and gave me half a sovereign—I gave it to Mrs. Jones—he went away, and I saw no more of him—Mrs. Jones would never let</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you know how much money your sister got on the Monday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, I do not—she never told me—she did not tell me that she had any negus when she was introduced to the gentleman—I do not think any gentleman goes up stairs without having negus—I know gentleman always give money—my sister got money—I dare say she got about half a sovereign—I do not know how much he did give her—I never heard from her—we dined about twelve o'clock on Mon<lb/>day—I saw my sister in the house that day—she did not walk out that day I saw my sister in the house that day—she did not walk out that at all—she was as much a stranger in London as I was—I was never in London before in my life—she drank tea in the house on Monday, about five o'clock—Mrs. Jones drank tea with us and two girls who were in the house besides—we were about an hour at tea—it was about six o'clock when we had done tea—I and my sister were together as much as we could be—we remained together that Monday evening after tea—we went to bed about seven o'clock that evening—we slept together—I am sure that we un<lb/>dressed and went to bed together—I and my sister were together from five till six o'clock, taking tea together—we sat chatting together from six to seven o'clock. we then went to bed—that was the first Monday I was in London—there is no mistake about that at all, I am sure.</p>

               <p>laughed and said so—we were all laughing together—I do not think she said she was going to London with <hi rend="italic">Old Patty</hi>—I have very heard Feaks called <hi rend="italic">Old Patty</hi>—I did not hear my sister says she was going to London with <hi rend="italic">Old Patty.</hi>—my sister lived with Mrs. Arbour at Emanuel College—she had another servant in my sister's place when we came away—I do not know the young woman—I know her by sight—I do not know her name nor any thing about her—she had not come before my sister left—we have seen her since in the street—my sister and I were at the fair together—I chatted to various people in the fair—I saw that young woman in the fair, I do not know her name—I never had any conversation with her—she is the girl who got no sister's place after she left Mrs. Arbour's—we had no conversation with her in the fair whatever—she said nothing to me or my sister—she might say, "How do you do?"—my sister did not know her name—she has been a girl in the street, I believe—my sister told me she was the girl who succeeded her at her place—there is an mis<lb/>take about that—I was at my mother Goddard's house, at Cambridge, about a fortnight—Ann Clark used to visit there—we left my brother's to come to London to this place—we told him that Feaks had got us a situ<lb/>ation, and that we were coming to London, and we came from his house—the wagon starts a mile or a mile and a half from my brother's house, from the Little Rose, and we both got in at the Little Rose, where it starts from—there is no mistake at all about that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> If your sister swore you did not get in there, but followed the wag<lb/>on and overtook it, is that true? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> yes, it is true—we did walk on the road, and get in on the road—I do not know Francis Freeman, belonging to Wright and Shelford's wagon—I do not remember walking with the wagoner—I did not ask half a crown from any body at Hoddesdon for walking out with him in the evening—I never asked Freeman for half a crown, nor any young man—I swear that.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were you talking out with any body between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of the 8th of July, at a place on the road where all the wagons stop, and where yours stopped among the rest? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I never walked with any young man on the road or in the fields, not coming with the wagon—I did not—I swear that positively—I do not know George Everett by name (<hi rend="italic">looking at him</hi>) I do not know that young man—he knows nothing of me, nor I of him—he is the boy who came up when we came along in the wagon—there was a man and his wife, and six children, in the wagon,—I got out of the wagon with the woman. and helped her to carry her child—I did not get out between ten and eleven o'clock at night—I swear that positively—nor was I taken out—I remained in the wagon all night—I rode a little way outside—I cannot tell what o'clock it was—it was night—it was so very full I could not sit for the children when I first got into the wagon—I did keep in all night, but it was the next evening I got out, and rode on the foot-board a little way—after we got in I kept in all night, and my sister too—the second evening I rode by the side of the woman, with her little boy and that lad, outside—it was not very light nor very dark—it was about ten o'clock in the evening, or be<lb/>tween and eleven—I got out of the wagon myself—nobody lifted me out—I did not walk with any body—I got out, and got behind, and sat immediately on the foot-board—my sister was in the wagon—no wagoner kissed me or took any liberties with me that night—that I swear.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I suppose, as your sister and you slept together on Monday night, she told you of the liberty the man had taken with her, and of his giving her the negus? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, she did not—we always slept together(—I took the 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after I was violated—I told my sister what had happened to me the next day—she did not tell me what had happened to her—Mrs. Jones told me she had been seduced—that was before I was introduced to the gentleman—Mrs. Jones did not tell me how much money my sister had got.</p>

I know Elizabeth and Mary Vale, and their mother—on the Monday after the girls went to London, I heard the mother ask Feaks how he left the girls—he said he left them quiet well—he said, "They have got good places in the Borough; one is a nurse-maid's place"—the other was in the same house, but he could not say what capacity it was—about a quarter or half an hour after, Feaks said to me, "I think the girls were very lucky in getting a place the same day they went to London"—I said, "Yes, they were; what sort of a place is it?"—he said, "They tell me it is a regular good place"—I said, "Well, if it is so, it is better for the girls—I said, "It looks queer for girls to go up out of the country, and get a place, not having any character"—he said, "It is a regular <hi rend="italic">stop-up</hi> place, they tell me"—on the Monday following, I heard the mother ask Feaks how the girls were—he said he did not see them, but one of them came down to the inn, and left word that they were quite well—he said, "They have got a place in London-street, Fleet-street"—he did not say what the places were—the mother said, "I thought you told me they had got a place in the Borough"—he said, "They did not like that place; they left that, and went to the place in London-street, Fleet-street"—he did not say any more—in consequence of the mother's desire, I after<lb/>wards went to Lombard-street, with the porter Pettit—I knocked at the door, and somebody let me in—it was not Jones—I saw both the girls there, and Mrs. Jones—she came to the door, and asked me in—I went in, and she asked me if I would take any thing to drink—I said, "No "—she said, "Will you take a glass of gin?"—I said, "No, "—I sat down a few minutes—the first young woman came to me, and I asked it I could see the other—she said, "She is not up; she is not dressed"—it was about eleven o'clock or later—I saw her afterwards—Mrs. Jones asked me if I could get her two strong hearty girls—I told her that I did not know of any young girls that wanted a place—I have known these girls about two years and three quarters.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sailor. I came home about three weeks ago, and am residing at No.19, Providence-street. On Saturday eight, the 3rd September, at ten o'clock, I saw the prisoner Boulton in the King William public-house—she asked me to treat her with a drop of gin, and so I did—I paid for it, and changed a sovereign there—I received the change from the master of the house, and she took two half-crowns out of my hand—I did not give her permission—I asked her to give it to me again—she said, "I won't giver it you again, you come and sleep with me, "—I said, "I won't sleep with nobody"—then she ran away from me—I had known her before, she lived in New Gravel-lane—I went there at half-past ten o'clock the same night—I knocked at the door, and found Web<lb/>ber—her house is about twenty fathoms from where I was drinking—Webber opened the door—I asked where Ann was—she said, "She is not in the house"—it was raining, and I sat down in the chair, and just as I was sleeping, Webber said, "Why do you sleep in this way? You had bet<lb/>ter go up stairs and lie down on the bed"—I said, "Well, when she comes into the house you call me"—I went up stairs and laid down—I took my jacket, handkerchief, and hat off, and put on the chair, and my waistcoat and watch under my pillow—there was ten sovereigns in gold in a small bag in my waistcoat pocket, and 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and some small coppers in the other waistcoat<lb/>pocket—she took away the last copper—I fell asleep, and awoke at two o'clock in the morning—I heard the watchman <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> out, and knocked at the door because I could not open it myself—Webber came up and opened the door—I asked her what time it was—she said, "I think it is two or three o'clock in the morning"—I said, "Well, now I will see what o'clock in is"—she said, "Last night your two shipmates came up stairs to you, and took away your watch and money"—I said, "What business had you to let them come to take my watch and money? that won't do; I suppose you took it to take care of it; if you give it to me back again, I will make you a good present"—she said afterwards, "If you don't <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi> that word I will give you something"—I went to the house of my companions, and returned, and told her my shipmates had never been near—she said, "Yes, two of your shipmates came up stairs, and took your watch and money; and when he came down he gave me 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. as a present"—I said, "I won't do; that is not true; give me my watch and purse, and I will give you a present"—the policeman heard a noise—he came and said "What is this?"—I told him what I accused her of—he overhauled all the house, to see if he could find any thing—she took up a knife, and said, "If you don't <hi rend="italic">knock off</hi> that word, I will run you through and though"—the policeman found some of the property under the floor.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">police-constable B</hi> 15.) I was on duty on the morn<lb/>ing of the 8th of September, at ten minutes past one o'clock, in Palace-yard—I went round the shed which is used by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, and heard a footstep—I saw the Prisoner going from there towards the water side—I went down to see who it was, and saw it was a waterman—I had no suspicion of him then—he called out to a man is a barge, "Go to bed," and some one cried out, "We are just come from bed—he said, "Is that the way you talk to me, your master?"—"Who are you? "cried one, "I will give you a toss for a pot of beer"—I thought all was not right, and I went round the yard, where I found this bundle, near the place where the prisoner had been standing—it contained these brass fittings in a handkerchief—I then looked about the carpenter's shop, and found two bolts, which had been taken out of it, close to the door—I called in M'Carthy—two boards in the shed had been taken down to enable a man to get in—I gave my lantern to M'Carthy to go in, and see if there was any one inside—I did not go in myself—I went round and saw the prisoner standing with another man, near the bridge, having a pot of porter together—I saw these finger-plates sticking out of the prisoner's jacket pockets—I said, "I shall take you on suspicion of breaking open the car<lb/>penter's shop "—he said nothing to that—I called a bridge watchman to my assistance, and in going along, the prisoner kept throwing these metal things out of his pockets, which I now produce—I stopped and searched him, and found all these articles which are in this basket—some came out of one of his pockets, and some out of another—he had some of them in his pockets, and some in the waterman's locker, which is about eight paces from the carpenter's shop—I found three keys on the prisoner, one of which opened the lock of the door of the waterman's locker—I found there these brass locks, and some pieces of iron, which I produce—I had not seen the prisoner before that night.</p>

Richard's—he afterwards went with an empty van to Irongate Wharf—I watched him from there, with a full van, again to the same place—he came away with twelve prickles, and again went to Good<lb/>man's-yard—he stopped, and gave the reins to the boy, and got down, he took the hindmost prickle as before, put it on his back, and went to the stable—I could see into the stable—I saw a man there, (whom I believe to be Tame, but I could not swear to him,) harnessing a horse—after this full prickle had been carried in, King brought out an empty one, and moved the hind one, and put that behind it—I watched the van the second time, and saw the same thing occur again—I followed the van to Mr. Richards's were-house the second time—I then tapped King on the shoulder, and side, "You have been robbing your master of bottles"—he said, "What?"—I told him he had been robbing his master—I took him into the counting-house and told Mr. Richards what I had seen—he gave him into custody—the cart arrived at Goodman's-yard at half past-four or a quarter to five o'clock—I afterwards went to Tame's house with Mr. Richards and three officers—I took Tame—he was standing at the door—that was about half-past six o'clock—the road from the Ironagte Wharf to Mr. Richards's is not through Goodman's-yard—it is not much out of the way—it was not the direct way.</p>

"What bottles? I know nothing about any bottles?"—I then went to the stable—Them went with me in custody—I asked him, "Have you a loft?—he said, "Yes, I have"—"What is in it?"—he said, "Nothing but hay and straw"—I said, "We must search it"—Smith was found at the stable and taken, and a man named Butler was taken, but discharged the same evening—we went up stairs into the loft—I did not minutely search it that evening, but I found a large bin of bottles, and ascertained they were our property—I drew samples from various parts of the bin—I did not examine every bottle—I have brought samples from the bottles in our bulk, and, from what were found there, my belief is, that there cannot be a doubt on the mind of any one, after looking at them, that they are the same—the greater portion of them were made at one particular ma<lb/>nufactory, and no other bottles are permitted to be sent from there to any other person in town—they are under a heavy penalty not to do it—the samples are here—the bottles found in that bin were wine-bottles—they were different sorts, disposed in different layers, and of two different manufactories—the ship they were unloading that bin what day was from our ma<lb/>nufacturer—we found different qualities—we had vessels unloading the day before, and on the Wednesday—King had been employed in carting these bottles, and we found them placed in the bin in the same order that King had to remove them from the ship, from two different vessels—that bin was not covered over—we found a variety of other bottles on a subsequent search on the premises—we found some that had the bloom on them, at his house, and in the loft—they had not been used—there is no way of restoring that bloom—we send no bottles out with that bloom on them—they are all washed and cleaned—there are six bottles of one sort to the gallon, and some four—we found some we call pale claret bottles, which I be<lb/>lieve are of a shape and quality peculiar to our house—they are designed for Bucellas and pale brandy—this is one that we found, and this is one from our warehouse—the bloom is produced by the sulphur that comes from the coals—we remove it by vitriolic acid and water—it is a difficult thing to remove—103 dozen bottles were found on Tame's premises—I re<lb/>ceived information which led me to the house of James Goss, ship<lb/>chandler, and exporter of wine, beer, and spirits—I found twenty-four dozen bottles there of the kind that were landed on the 14th, and which King was employed to convey-that would be the quantity contained in four</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mr. Goss. I was expecting some bottles to be sent from Mr. Tame's—I went to his premises on the morning of Wednesday, the 14th—I saw Tame, and asked him what time he was going to send the bottles in—he said in the course of the afternoon or evening—I do not recollect that he said why he had not sent them—I was at my master's on the evening of that day, and Tame brought two gross of bottles in a cart drawn by one horse—the same bottles were afterwards claimed by the prosecutor—they came in prickles—I did not notice whether they had been recently washed, but in the morning I filled them—I then found they were wet—I did not notice any thing then, but when I corked them I noticed one or two with the bloom on—I did not examine them all, but this attracted my attention—they were delivered up to Messrs. Richards.</p>

               <p>there was a receipt signed, I did not sign it—I filled them on Thurs<lb/>day, and they were taken away on Saturday—we have a great many bottles—we buy them generally of one person—I received them as good regular bottles—I saw nothing particular in the shape of them—If I had seen them a week afterwards any where else, I should not have known them.</p>

               <p>Tame's Defence. I am placed before this bar innocently, on a case I do not know any thing at all about. I am in the habit of buying new bottles as well as old—my trade is all over London, and I buy bottles (when I am short) of other bottles merchants in the new way; and, also I get a great many from on board ships, and there is no doubt but they come from the very same factory that Mr. Richards's does. When these bottles were received I was out very near the whole of the day; I generally am everyday. I keep at home three or four men to do my business while I am out bottling wine, and attending wine-merchants. I never bought a stolen bottle to my knowledge—I should be very sorry for my men to rob me, and I would not encourage it in any one else—I am a wine and bottle-merchant.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Captain of the Royal Horse Guards, and reside in the barracks, in Regent's Park, On Saturday night, the 17th of September, I was walking along Albany-street—I turned across to some oaken palings, by the new church which is building, to make water in a corner—the prisoner rushed up to me with a gun in his hand, and with very violent abuse threatened to shoot me if I did not he off—he was very drunk—he came from against the palings, a little higher up the street—from the violence of his appearance I immediately seized the gun—he had not pointed it at me then—he had threatened me—he struggled for it—the ramrod broke, and the barrel of the gun slipped through my hands—I had thrown the prisoner down in the struggle—he immediately got up, put himself in the corner, pointed the gun at me, and said, "Now I will do for you," and he snapped the gun, but it did not strike fire—he still kept the gun presented towards me, after the trigger had gone down, and he let himself into a little door—it seemed to be his own premises—he shut the door, and said, "Now if you came near me, I will do for you again"—I got two policeman, and we went together—we knocked at the door of the hovel where the prisoner was, and desired him to come out, which he did—I then told the policeman what he had done, and desired them to take him in charge, and the gun—I went with the policeman down to the station-house, and saw the gun—the pan was open, and the lock at half-cock—he did not say any thing then—he was very drunk indeed—he said on Monday, at the examination, that five men had attacked him, and threatened to come back that night and beat him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I was in Albany-street about twelve o'clock, and heard a call of "Police," and saw the prosecutor—when I came up the prisoner was inside the place, in a small office which is built for paying the labourers—he is a private watchman, employed to take care of the premises—he does not reside there constantly, but he is there at night—I asked what he meant by attempting the life of the prose<lb/>cutor—he said he would shoot him or any other man who would make</p>

               <p>water on the premises—I asked him where the gun was said, "There it is, "pointing behind the door—I found the gun with the open—I drew the ramrod, and it was broken—I got the prosecutor's cane, and measured the piece—I found it was loaded, nut I could not draw the charge, as the ramrod was broken—the lock was in good order—the pan was open, and the lock on the half-cock—I took the prisoner to the sta<lb/>tion-house—the prosecutor was stating the charge there to the Inspector, when the prisoner made a sudden rush at the gun, which I had in my hand, and said, "If I have not shot then, I would do for you now, you cowardly rascal"—he was very drunk—on Sunday morning, the 18th, I drew the charge, which I produce—it was loaded with powder and large shot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> I was employed to look after the premises, and on Friday night observed a man removing some boards off where there was some lead piping; he came with intent to cut it away. I came up to him; he attacked me, and we fought together for five minutes; he got over the paling, and told me he would have the pipe next night, in spite of me, and would come with four or five more. I told my employer of it, and he said I had better have arms to protect myself, and he furnished me with the gun. I went out that night for about five minutes; when I came back I found the gentleman making water against the shed door; I said, "If you do that again I will shoot you; "I went towards the door, and the gentleman caught hold of the gun, and, in struggling for it, the ramrod was broken, and the pan opened. The gentleman said he would get a policeman. I went in doors, and had plenty of time to draw the charge, but I did not wish to discharge any thing. It was the gentleman's hand that caught the top of the cap, and pulled it back; the piece was never cocked from first to last, nor was there any priming in the pan at any time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a porter in Newgate-market. On Monday, the 29th of August, I was in the tap-room of the Rainbow public-house, in Newgate-street, in company with the prisoner—he tossed me for a pint of beer, which I paid for, and we had half a quartern of rum—after drinking the rum the prisoner refused to pay for it—he had to pay for the whole of it—he had called for it—the deceased, Robert Beach, was the barman—on the prisoner's refusing to pay for the rum, Beach put his hand on his shoul<lb/>der, and told him he could not leave the house till he hand paid for it—the prisoner tried to get out, and the deceased took hold if his collar—the pri<lb/>soner struck him on the side of the head—the blow did not seem sufficient to knock a child down—it was a very slight blow—a scuffle ensued be<lb/>tween them, but I did not see any blows struck—the prisoner was intoxi<lb/>cated a little—Beach put his head a little on one side, that was all I no<lb/>ticed—in the scuffle the prisoner's smock-frock came off—I picked it up, and put it on the tap-room table—he had the wristbands up, and in the scuffle it was pulled off by Beach—he pulled it over his head—I took two<lb/>pence out of the smock-frock, and paid the deceased for the rum—the de<lb/>ceased struck Storey in the eye, which knocked him against the wainscoat and stunned him, and knocked him down—that was after the scuffle—I dragged Beach into the tap-room and put him on the table—he asked me to get him a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>, which I did, and when I came back the prisoner was gone home—that was all I saw—the deceased was not thrown down—he never fell at all—he was perfectly sober for what I know.</p>

                  </hi>. I was at the Rainbow at the time—I went there with the deceased, who was my brother-in-law; and while I was there, the prisoner and Denton came into the tap-room—I saw them toss for beer or half-and-half, which, I believe, Denton lost—they afterwards tossed for rum, which Storey lost—they both partook of it; and when they came out of the tap-room to the bar, they were going away without paying for it—Beach said, "It is not paid for"—Storey said it was, if he had had it, but he denied having had it—Denton and myself told him he had, and persuaded him to pay for it—he was afterwards going away without paying—Beach came out of the bar, and followed him to the door—he had just got outside the door when Beach put his right hand to his left arm to prevent his going away—the prisoner turned round, and struck him with his right hand, about the neck or head—it was not a hard blow, nor yet <hi rend="italic">easy</hi>—it was a middling blow—Beach did not fall—I directly went up to him, and pulled Beach in<lb/>side, as they had got hold of one another—I parted them—they still stood outside the bar, and Storey still wanted to fight—I told him, if he hit any body he should hit me, and I got between them—Beach said, "Let him alone; I dare say he will be quiet now;" and put his hand on my arm to keep me on one side, as Storey was about to take his smock-frock off to fight with Beach again—Beach got hold of the bottom part of the smock-frock to keep him from taking it off, but Beach was a cripple in both hands—he was a painter by trade—he could never open his hands far—Storey got his smock-frock off and threw it down, and he struck Beach again—that was a hardish blow—Beach lifted up both his hands in self-defence, and struck Storey—a scuffle ensued, and Storey fell very heavy against the wainscoat, and fell on the floor—he was taken into the tap-room by some<lb/>body—Beach went round directly, went into the bar, and sat himself down—he was very much in a tremble—I went into the tap-room, and Storey was sitting on a stop—he recognised me, and said, "You are going to take Cross's house"—he said, "I will recollect you, I will give you a turn for this"—I was about taking Cross's house at the time—I saw Beach in the bar after that, and Denton came to the bar with the 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for the rum—Beach refused it, because it was taken from the man's pocket—I said, "Nonsense! take it up, and put it in the till," and he did so—I left him about five mi<lb/>nutes afterwards, and in three quarters of an hour I was sent for, to say Beach was very ill—I went up stairs, and saw him being bled—he had been ailing for a couple of months before—he had had an attack of the gout</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Newgate-street.

On Monday, the 6th of September, about seven o'clock in the evening, I saw the prisoner at Mr. Vincent's skittle-ground, the Star and Garter, at Hammersmith—he asked me to go with him as far as the Broad<lb/>way—we went to the Suspension-bridge public-house—he went to ask the girl there if she was going to the play, and then we went to the Swan—he said he wanted to go out backwards, and left me in the tap-room—he was gone five or six minutes—he owed me, and we went down to the Star and Gar<lb/>ter again—there I left him—he said he would go and get his watch out of pawn—I met him next morning, and we come to London together, and went to Bartholomew-fair—I saw him sell two coins at Mr. Whitford's at Smithfield-bars, for 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—we came home together—he gave it to officer after I was taken up.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the service of Mrs. Mary Pearce, of Brom<lb/>ley. The prisoner Brown was employed to work in her garden—on the 25th of August, between one and two o'clock I took the dinner things into the kitchen—there were some silver spoons, which I put on the dresser, and went up stair, leaving them—Brown was working near the gate, which goes out in front of the house from the area, but it is always kept locked—I went in about a quarter of an hour to wash the spoons, and missed one of the table-spoons—Brown was then standing at the kitchen door—I went and told my young mistress that 1 missed a table-spoon, and asked Brown if he had seen any one come in—he said he had not—he went away—I saw Wilds standing outside the same gate that day—this is my mistress's spoon.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a cabriolet-builder, in Red-lion-yard, Great Warner-street, Clerkenwell.

William Pearce. 2nd of September, half-past three o'clock."

               <p>and waited a few minutes, and then knocked against; but, before I went down, I asked Catling who I was to ask for—he said he did not know his name, but he gave a description of his dress, and told me to go and ask for a person that had brought in a black and white dog—I did so—a man poked his head out of the door—I had some conversation with him about a dog (Catling was in Fleet-street, in the cart)—I went in at last, and there saw the prisoner Cook—he was in the act of undoing his shoes, as if un<lb/>dressing himself—I asked him where he had been—he said in the country—he said he knew nothing about any dog—I put the hand-cuffs on him, put him into the cart, and took him before the Magistrate, at Enfield—I found a crow-bar upon him, also this knife, this phosphorus box, this watch, and an empty box; and on Catling, I found nine skeleton keys, a knife, a cord and a string, by which you might lead a dog—some salve on silk, to tame dogs, and four duplicates—there is a smell about the salve that is particular—the box I took from Cook has just the same smell—any of these keys will open Mr. Stephens's stable door.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. About half-past four o'clock in the morning on the 27th of August, I was at the Islington turnpike<lb/>gate, watching—it was day-light—I saw the five prisoners come from George-yard—Jones and Bishop were riding in a donkey-cart, which Henry Cubbage was driving—James Cubbage and Manning were walking by the side of it—I followed them to the Peacock—they were talking together, as if in company—Henry Cubbage then got out of the cart—I followed them to the Blue-coat Boy, about 150 yards from George-yard—I stopped the cart there, and Jones jumped out and ran away—Bishop and Henry Cub<lb/>bage were taken out of the cart—James Cubbage was secured, and Manning ran away—he was brought back by Savory and Virtue—I went over to the station-house with the prisoners in custody—I had to pass George-yard in the way, and saw Jones there—he was secured, and taken to the station-house—I saw Knott, another constable, find three half-crowns in the cart, wrapped up in an old sack—they were given to the sergeant—the name of Henry Cubbage was painted on the cart—I knew him before.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a boot and shoemaker, and live in Stockwell-street, Greenwich. On the 31st of August the prisoner came to my shop, between five and six o'clock—she was shown into the parlour by my servant, and sat down to be measured for a pair of boots—while she was sitting down I observed her lay hold of her shawl on one side, and hold it very tight, and from that circumstance I suspected she had some<lb/>thing belonging to me—I said to her, immediately after measuring her, "Have you not a bad arm?" thinking that might be the case—she said, "No"—I opened her shawl and saw the shoes under her arm—I took them from her, and said, "These are my shoes"—she at first said they were not—I said, "I know they are, and shall give you into custody"—I sent the boy for a policeman, and she was going to fall on her knees to beg pardon, and said she would pay for them, but, being frequently robbed, I gave her into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am landlord of the Ship and Sailor, Effingham-place, Deptford. On Wednesday evening, the 7th of September, the pri<lb/>soners came to my house, about a quarter past eight—Johnson said, "Landlord, did not you trust me a pot of beer this afternoon?"—I said, "I did"—he said, "Will you trust me another?"—I said, "No, I can't trust any more"—he said, "Then I won't pay you what I owe you"—I said, "I can't help that"—one of his comrades said, "Why don't you pay the man for his beer?"—he then gave me a sixpence, and I gave him change—they then asked me for a private room—I said, "There is nothing but the club-room up stairs"—they said that would do—I said, "What do you want of a private room" all your comrades are here"—they said they had a little business to settle—I lighted them up stairs, and took them a quartern of rum—I suspected something was not right—I called a young man, and put him to look through a broken square of glass into the room, to notice what they were doing—he came down to me, and said something—when Johnson came down he showed me a sovereign, and asked if I was in want of a sovereign—I said, "No"—he said, "If you are, I will lend you one, or four, or five more"—I said, "All I have to say to you is, take care of your money"—he showed me a yellow canvass bag with some sovereigns in it—he knocked it against the counter and said, "I have got plenty more landlord"—I said, "Very good, take care of them"—Waters then came down, and he showed me about ten sovereigns, open in his hand—each of them changed half-a-sovereign with me.</p>

On Wednesday night, the 7th of September, I received information from the prosecutor of his loss, and from Coleman—I went to the barracks about ten o'clock—the prison<lb/>ers were not there—soon afterwards I met them in Old King-street, going towards the barracks—I followed them into the barracks—the serjeant of the guards ordered a file of men to put them into the guard-room—I asked them if they knew Coleman the milkman—they said, "Yes"—I asked if they had seen him that evening—they said, "No"—I asked if they had been down where he lived—they said, "No"—I asked if they had been with a gentleman who was in liquor—they said, "No"—I told them the charge—they said they knew nothing about it, and had no money about them—I was going to search Waters—he put his hand up to take his cap off, and some halfpence fell out—he was doing something to his cap—I seized his wrist, and in his hand found six sovereigns, half-a-crown, and three shillings—Johnson refused to be searched, and was very violent—he took a shilling, a sixpence, and a few halfpence from his pocket, and there down on the ground—he was searched, but nothing was found on him—he was very violent, and threw himself about.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Bedford-place. Borough-road. On the 13th of September I was walking in Blackfriars-road, near the New Cut, and saw the prisoner there—my sister Rose was there with me—we all three went into a public-house—he accompanied us to our lodging, and went up stairs with us—he remained in the room with me—my sister was con<lb/>stantly in and out—he proposed to drink tea with us—I said I could not afford it, but if he would send half a crown down to the landlady, she would send tea up—he pulled a parcel out of his pocket, which seemed to me to contain half-sovereigns—my sister was in the room at the time he gave me two half-crowns, which I took down to the landlady—I shortly afterwards left him alone with my sister, for nearly half an hour, and when I came back she had got half-a-sovereign—she showed it to me—I said it was not a good one—she sounded it on the drawers, and said it was good—the prisoner said he wished he had got a thousand of them, and that it was good—I asked him to give me one, and, after considering, he said he could not afford it, but at last said, if I would fetch the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. back, he would give me one—I fetched him the 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and gave them to him, and he gave me what I supposed was half-a-sovereign—he left the room almost imme<lb/>diately, and said he would be back in a quarter of an hour—after he was gone, I rubbed the half-sovereign between my fingers, and thought it was not good—I went down stairs and saw the landlady, and then went out in pursuit of him—I found him about two doors, below, on the opposite side of the way—I told him he had given me bad money—he said, had he? he would give me good, and asked me to give him that I had got in my hand—I said, "No"—he said if I would give it to him, he would give me good, and asked if I would have it all in gold, or all in silver—I said I did not care what it was, so that it was good—he walked a good way—I turned round to look for a policeman—we walked a long distance—he asked me if I would accompany him to his place, and then he would give it me all in silver—he went to snatch both half-sovereigns, and snatched one from my hand—Wyborn and two policeman came up—I saw him then take out of his right-hand pocket a brown paper parcel and throw it into the road—it was found to contain several gilt sixpences—I gave the one I had in my hand, to Corstorpham the constable.</p>
