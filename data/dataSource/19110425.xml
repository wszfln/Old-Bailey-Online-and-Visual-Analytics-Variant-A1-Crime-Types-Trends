Who keeps this room?" The woman said, "I do, I pay 6s. a week for it." I said to prisoner, "Do you live here?" He said, "I have been staying here a day or two." We searched the room and found in the pocket of the jacket prisoner is now wearing five counterfeit florins separately wrapped in tissue paper. Prisoner was lying on the bed. He said, "I have been well shopped. I bet you had to pay a bit of gold for this." We then found in a cupboard 30 florins wrapped together in paper. On the floor of the cupboard were six defaced</p>

I followed him round the corner when he entered the "Salisbury," and about 10 minutes afterwards came out, joined two other men, and they all entered the "Salisbury"; five minutes afterwards prisoner came out alone. I said, "Did you go into the fish shop 15 minutes ago?" He said, "No; I have not been into any fish shop," and ran back into the "Salisbury." I seized him by the collar; he pushed me against the door and threw coin (produced) on the floor, which I picked up. I then took the prisoner to Cookson's shop. Prisoner said to Cookson, "I have not been in your shop before to-night, Governor, have I?" Cookson said, "Yes; you have been in my shop before." He identified the coin. I took prisoner to Walham Green Police Station. When charged he said, "I had it given to me for half a sovereign. He was searched and one penny was found upon him.</p>

On March 21, having received some information, I tried to stop this cheque (Exhibit 1) in consequence of information received on March 21. It is dated March 18, drawn on the London and Provincial Bank, made payable to J. B. Huxley, crossed and passed through the London and South<lb/>Western Bank. The endorsement, "J. B. Huxley, Sheffield," has every indication of being in prisoner's handwriting. I have seen him write. It is also like Huxley's writing. I reported the matter to the police, and he was arrested. He was in the advertising department.</p>

On March 23 I saw prisoner and told him I was a police officer making inquiries re<lb/>specting a letter which had been stolen from the firm's office on the 18th containing a cheque addressed to "Mr. J.B. Huxley, of Sheffield," which was changed on that same day by a Mr. John Cleal, of Askew Road, Shepherd's Bush, greengrocer, for a man named Hobbs, living in the neighbourhood of Askew Road. He said, "I have known Mr. Cleal about six months. I know nothing about the cheque." He was taken to the station and when charged he said, "I am a silly fool." (To prisoner.) You said, "I am a silly fool," not "absolutely nil." At the police court I also said you said that.</p>

                  </hi>. I am secretary and an accountant to W. E. Levy and Company, who manage several public-houses for Miss Briton Lloyd, of which the "Streatham Park Tavern" is one. on February 23, 1910, I engaged prisoner as manager at Â£2 10s. a week and his board and lodgings. I handed him this printed form of instructions (Exhibit 1), which tells him that a balance-sheet is to be made out by the manager and forwarded to the head office every Monday together with all vouchers, and that all moneys, with the exception of Â£50 which was to be kept as "float," were to be paid into the bank every Monday and Wednesday. I gave him Â£50 to start with to use as change; he always had to keep back Â£50. He gave me this receipt (Exhibit 2). The account was at the London County and Westminster Bank and he had a paying-in book (Ex<lb/>hibit 3)</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250018"/>
               <p>in which all the entries, except the last one, are in his hand<lb/>writing. He also kept this takings book (Exhibit 4). During the early part of the year I complained to him more than once as to his not paying the money in on the right date. On March 22 I called and asked why he had not paid into the bank on the Monday last. He said, "I told Mr. Reed (a clerk in the office) that I had had some trouble with some Mitchamites, and that I had not had time to pay in on Monday, but I did so first thing on Tuesday morning." I asked him if he had paid in that day, and he said, "No; not yet. It is all right as I am going up to the bank as soon as the wife comes down." I said we would make it up together as things had been so unsatisfactory lately, and we went into the parlour. I said I was rather of opinion that he had not got it and that I wanted to see the whole of the money he had got on the premises. I said, "Have you got it? Tell me the truth and own up." He said, "I have not," and that he was Â£20 short. By comparing the takings book with the pass-book I found that he had paid in everything up till the Sunday night. I asked him to produce the takings for the Monday and Tuesday, Â£38 2s. 1d., and said he was more than Â£20 short. He said, "Yes, it is about Â£34 short." He produced the Â£38 2s. 1d. The till registered the Wednesday's takings at Â£5 13s. 6d., and he told me that he had taken another Â£1; he ought to have had altogether Â£56 13s. 6d., but all he could produce was Â£10 12s. 1d., making a deficiency of Â£46 1s. 5d. He then said he was Â£50 short, and I asked him how he had managed to get into this awful muddle. He said, "Someone put it on me for Â£15." I asked him what he meant, and he said it was the money he owed whilst he had been out of em<lb/>ployment. I said, "When was this?" and he said, "About October last." I asked him how he had managed to account to the stocktaker, who took stock of all the money in the house about once a fortnight, and he said, "I told him I had got more inside than I had," and pointed to the drawer. I reported the matter to my employes, and the same evening I gave him into custody.</p>

Prisoner said, "Yes, I am the guilty one and, being guilty, I will have to put up with it." He afterwards said, "You might have given me a chance till to-morrow morning and I could have found the money. There is one thing I can say, I have not spent it in horseracing or gambling." On the way to the station he said that he had been out of work a long time before he came down to the "Streatham Park Tavern" and had got into debt, and his creditors pressing him for the money, that is what had become of the money. When charged he made no reply.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). The evidence given is perfectly correct. I tendered the coin not knowing it was bad. I did not run away from the "White Hart." I saw a friend getting off a tram and ran out to speak to him. I told Sergeant Edwards that I had changed a half-sovereign at the "Three Nuns" and that the barmaid, Miss Hicks, had given me a bad florin in change and had taken it back. I could easily have run away but made no attempt to do so. I am 63 years of age and have never come in con<lb/>tact with bad money before. I am a foreman tailor and have been working at Acton and Uxbridge. After leaving Acton I had Â£2 10s., and coming to London I met the captain of my old regiment under whom I had been in Egypt in 1882, who gave me two more sovereigns. I was a day or two in London knocking about and, having taken some drink, I must have received these coins in change.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never mentioned to anyone until to-day that I had run out to see a friend in the tramcar; I reserved that for my defence. It is not true that at the "Three Nuns" I tendered a bad florin to Miss Hicks.</p>

April 20 I saw the barmaid Hicks at the "Three Nuns" and asked her if she remembered a man tendering a half-sovereign for drinks and receiv<lb/>ing a bad florin amongst the change. After consideration she said, "No, but on April 4 a man came into the four-ale bar in company with three other men; he called for four drinks and tendered a bad florin in payment, which I returned to him; he said, 'I know where I got it from,' and paid for the drinks with coppers." At prisoner's request I have seen Alfred Poulton, tailor, 223, High Street, Acton, who informed me that prisoner had worked for him from the first week in February to March 18, left on his own accord, and his work was satisfactory. I also visited Stransom and Sons, 50, High Street, Ux<lb/>bridge, who informed me that prisoner had promised to work for them on March 27, but had failed to do so and had been employed by E. A. House, of 123, High Street, Uxbridge. I found he had been em<lb/>ployed by House from March 20 to March 24 and left on his own accord.</p>

He crossed the road oppo<lb/>site Charles Street, spoke to a number of boys, placed his hand in his right hand trouser pocket, took out a coin and gave it to a boy. I spoke to the boy and he showed me half-a-crown (produced), which I took from him, and asked the boy to go with me towards the prisoner. Prisoner ran away into St. Vincent Square and out again into Vauxhall Bridge Road, where he was stopped by another officer. I told him I should take him into custody for uttering a counterfeit half-crown. He made no reply. On the way to the station he be<lb/>came violent, put his hand in his pocket, and drew out a number of coins which he threw into the road. I picked up 19 half-crowns (pro<lb/>duced). When charged he said, "I got them myself this afternoon from Fritz Marshall, opposite the White Horse, Tottenham Court Road. I went to a hotel to have a drink and they told me it was bad. I could not believe it. I saw a boy and gave him half-a-crown to buy a loaf for me." He was searched and there was found upon him five separate shillings, two sixpences, 1s. 4d. bronze, good money, two counterfeit florins, a quarter pound of tea, and three pawn<lb/>tickets. The boy got away in the crowd.</p>

                  </hi> (Prisoner, not on oath). On Saturday, April 15, I met Fritz Marshall, who had owed me 35s. for the last 12 months, and asked for the money. He said he had not got all the money, but he gave me 10s. He said he was working for a book<lb/>maker and asked me to make a bet, which I did on two horses, one at 15s. to win and 5s. for a place and another one at 5s. to win. One horse lost and the other won. He asked me to see him on Tuesday afternoon at the "White Horse" Hotel, Tottenham Court Road, which I did at 2 o'clock on Tuesday; he paid me 30s. in loose silver and we went to Shepherd's Bush on business. In the evening I had a drink at a hotel and produced a half-crown. The barman gave me the money back and said it was no good. I said I could not believe that, but I gave him a 2s. piece which was good. I live at Vauxhall Bridge Road and I sent a boy to a shop for a loaf, giving him a half<lb/>crown, when I was taken into custody. I did not know the money was bad. I had never seen bad money in my life before.</p>

                  </persName>. On February 22 about 7.15 I saw prisoners in Harrow Road. I stopped them and asked what they had in the bundles. They told me they contained rubber. One piece of the mat was wrapped in sacking and the other had news<lb/>paper round it. I asked where they got it from. They said, "We bought it from a man in Holborn who had it on a barrow, and gave 1s. apiece for it." I was not satisfied with their answer, took them to Paddington Green Police Station, and charged them with unlawful possession. They made no reply. I should say the mat weighs about 1/2 cwt., and is worth 6d. a pound.</p>

They were searched, no money was found on either of them. On Galt I found this knife which smelt very strongly of rubber.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bryan. Wilkinson has a good character, he has been known to the police 17 years as a licensed cab-driver. The knife and rubber were brought to Snow Hill Station on the morning of the 23rd. The knife was separate, in an envelope. The mat apparently had been freshly cut. I did not handle the rubber.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I live at 96, Clarendon Street, Harrow Road. I have been a licensed cab-driver 17 or 18 years. I have never been convicted or accused of any offence. I have known Galt 14 or 15 years. When I met him on February 22 I had not seen him for two or three years. I met him in Gray's Inn Road about 4 p.m. I had 2s. 5d. on me. Galt had not the rubber mat then. I first saw the mat on a barrow at the corner of Brook Street, Holborn, about 5 p.m.; it was not much past five. It was then in two pieces, one piece in brown paper with the ends exposed, the other had a piece of sack round it. I did not know the man; Galt spoke to him; he was looking at some boots. On the barrow also were oilcloth and office furniture. The man said he had been invited to clear an office out by the caretaker and he brought these goods out of it. Galt suggested I should lend him the money to buy the rubber as he thought it would fetch five or six shillings. We were to halve the proceeds. I bought the mat for two shillings. Galt took one part and I the other. I did not notice the address was stamped on the rubber. I never saw Galt's knife till we got to Paddington. He did not cut the mat. Neither of us examined the mat. Detective Smith took up the two pieces of rubber and looked at them.</p>

                  </hi>, Limes Road, Hampton Lane, Putney. On April 21 I was at Moorgate Street Metropolitan Railway Station. When I went to enter the train a man stand in the passage in the way where you go in the car and he do not move, and between us comes this one (pointing to prisoner). He struggled hard; he will go first and not let me go in. I cannot go back because behind was other people. I did not feel anything the first moment, but when the train want to go on he pushed me under the neck and my necktie comes out. My pin is secured. There is no doubt he had the pin in his hands and he took only the pearl. When I felt the pearl was away I catch him by the coat and he wrenched himself loose. He ran. I ran after him, calling, "Stop him." He ran to the next car. The guard and I caught him and we took him out. When he was in the second car he had nothing in his hand; he had thrown the pearl away. It has not been recovered.</p>

                  </hi>, railway guard. Before I gave the flag to start the train I saw prisoner running up the platform towards my end followed by an elderly gentleman, who was close on his heels calling, "Stop him." Prisoner ran the length of three cars. I followed prisoner and prosecutor into the car. I said to prisoner, "You must see the station-master; you are charged with stealing a pin." He made no reply. I took him out of the car and handed him over to the officials of the station.</p>

Prosecutor said, "He stole my pin," and afterwards corrected it and said, "The pearl out of the pin; he could not get the pin out." Prisoner said nothing in answer to that nor when he was formally charged. He refused to give any information about himself.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On this day I was travelling from Aldgate East to Shepherd's Bush. I did not get out of the train until the guard spoke. I was not on the platform at Moorgate. Street till I was brought out. At Moorgate Street a crowd of people were getting in the train. I stood up to make room for a lady to sit down and was hanging on to the strap. I saw people running out<lb/>side. Prosecutor came in and said, "You have got my pin." I said, "What?" He said, "My pin," and a little afterwards the guard came in. He took me outside and said, "You have this gentleman's pin." I did not gay anything; the truth is I had had a drop of drink and felt a bit upset. I had my ticket in the sleeve</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250025"/>
               <p>of my coat. I was not asked for it and did not know I had it on me at the police station. (Railway ticket handed to the prisoner). When I was searched this ticket was not found on me. It was on me when I was searched at Brixton. I showed it to the solicitor yester<lb/>day, who told me I was going to be defended. I generally put my ticket there. I found it yesterday morning.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I heard the guard's evidence. I heard him say the train was due out of Moorgate Street at 6.52. I said I got into his tram at Aldgate East. I asked the porter at Aldgate East the time of the next train. While I was in the passage I met a couple of chaps. We went to Webb's, had a couple of drinks. When we came out we walked up to Aldgate and I went from Aldgate with the same ticket. When the ticket inspector saw it he never clipped it because it was clipped. If it had not have been for the couple of friends I should have gone from Aldgate East.</p>

I have not seen the ticket produced to-day. I found no ticket on him. He had an overcoat on. I cannot say I turned his sleeve inside out. If he had a cuff I should naturally turn it down.</p>

                  </persName>, G Division. On March 22 I was on duty with Police-constable Wesley outside the "Angel" at Isling<lb/>ton about 7.10 p.m. Prisoner was standing in the street. On Burgess coming out from the "Angel" prisoner pulled a revolver from his coat pocket and fired at Burgess, who fell to the ground. Prisoner then pointed the revolver to his own head; I rushed up and secured him. He said, "Let me do it; he has ruined my life." On the way to the station he said, "I have done it; he ruined my life; he took my wife away; I had to do it; he jeered at me in the public." At the station he said, "I wish you had been sooner; you would have saved all this; as it is you have saved my life."</p>

                  </hi>. I have been living with prisoner for 18 years, and brought up his two children. The pistol produced belonged to pri<lb/>soner. On March 22, when he went out, he said, "I am going to meet my wife to<lb/>night; I will take the pistol in case I happen to meet Burgess, to defend myself." Prisoner is crippled in one arm. He had been separated from his wife for 18 years, and she had been living with Burgess. I advised him not to take the pistol with him, as he might get into mischief.</p>

Prisoner came in and went out again; he did not speak to me. Shortly afterwards I left; directly I got outside prisoner pulled a pistol from his pocket and fired at me, and I fell backwards on my head. I am still an out<lb/>patient at the hospital.</p>

                  </persName>, G Division. I was at the station when prisoner was brought in; he had a very wild appearance, with his eyes staring. The revolver handed to me by Wesley as having been taken from prisoner contained four ball cartridges and one empty cartridge case. On my charging prisoner with shooting at Burgess with intent to murder he said, "I went into the' Angel to have a drink, where I met Burgess; he insulted me and I had to defend my<lb/>self; I did not mean to do him any injury." On searching prisoner's room I found 39 ball cartridges, which fit this revolver.</p>

People were about standing in doorways and at the corner. They ran away and I chased the prisoners through Columbia Road into Crescent Place, where Goldsworthy ran into a house. Goddard ran into Baroness Road, where he was stopped. I heard nine or 10 shots altogether fired, of which I saw Goddard shoot two. (To the Court). This would be a slack time down that street.</p>

                  </persName>, 219 H. About 2.15 p.m. on April 3 I went with Police-constable Wells into Gascoyne Place, when I saw the two prisoners and another man standing in the centre of the road, each firing a revolver straight down the street. People were standing both sides of the road up against the houses. I gave chase. At the corner of Columbia Road and Gascoyne Place I saw Goddard hand a revolver to another man, who got away. Goddard was eventually caught in Baroness Road. I caught Goldsworthy. He had a revolver in his left hand. A man I do not know came up, tripped me, and threw me into the gutter. The other constables took up the chase. At the station Goldsworthy said, "They maimed me for life, and I meant to have my own back for what they done on Saturday night. It's a pity the shot did not kill him. One-eyed Woolgar done it on me on Saturday night." He had his head bandaged. I know a man named Woolgar.</p>
               <p>Statements before the Magistrate. Goldsworthy: "I want this statement attached to the depositions. Goddard was not there." Goddard: "I was not there. I did not have a revolver when I was arrested. I want to call a witness." (This witness did not appear).</p>
               <p>The statement that Goldsworthy had made was then read. It was to the effect that on Saturday night, March 30, a man named Johnnie O'Brien had picked a quarrel with him while he was in the "Norfolk" public-house; that he (prisoner) had fought and beat him; that on the following Saturday he was in Hoxton when four men, of whom Woolgar and O'Brien were two, set upon him; that Woolgar stabbed him under the right eye, and O'Brien stabbed him in the back of the head; that this necessitated him going to the hospital, where he had his wounds stitched up; that he was told if he prosecuted the fellows would think he was frightened of them; that he bought a re<lb/>volver, and on Sunday morning went down Brick Lane with the idea of finding Woolgar and shooting him in the leg; that he saw him with a number of others in Gascoyne Place, and fired one shot at his legs, but missed him; and that he had never seen Goddard before.</p>

I do not know if my husband is alive or dead only from what Hailstone says." When charged she said, "I did not know he was alive when I married Hailstone.

                  </hi>, 21, Willow Vale, Fulham, foreman baker. On August 25, 1910, I went through the form of marriage with the prisoner, of which the certificate is produced. (To the Judge.) I did not know prisoner was married. I first knew her at Maidenhead in 1902; I used to serve her with bread; she was carrying on a laundry business. I never saw her husband. She went by the name of Stacey. I lived with her from February, 1903; we then went to St. John's Wood, afterwards to Enfield for 12 months, then to Catford for two or three years, to Lewisham for two and a half years, about five months at Herne Bay, and then at Shepherd's Bush. I first knew that her husband was alive on March 22 at the Police Court. I was under the influence of drink at the time and I had been placed in an observation ward and she threatened to have me put away for two years, and I went to see if she was my legal wife. I cannot say whether I told the officer that I knew her first husband was aliveâI was in drink at the time.</p>

                  </persName>, City. On March 24, at 3.25 p.m., I was in Fenchurch Street opposite the L. and S.W. Bank, when I saw Adamson standing in front of Donald Currie and Co.'s offices, opposite to the Bank. Two other men whom I do not identify were near him. The other two went to the doorway of the bank and were joined by Adamson. On March 31, at 3.40 p.m., I saw Adamson in Fenchurch Street, by the L. and S.W. Bank. Observation was being kept on them by other officers, and we arrested them. At the station I found on Adamson two foolscap envelopes (produced) marked "Urgent," containing blank telegraph forms, wrapped up in newspaper (produced), with the numbers 137,518 and 1,175,764 on the two en<lb/>velopes. On Alexander was a similar envelope, containing four blank telegraph forms, marked "Private." When Alexander was arrested he was following a boy who had just left the L. and S.W. Bank, and had turned into Gracechurch Street. The two prisoners went into a gate<lb/>way. Alexander took off his hat and overcoat, which he gave to Adam<lb/>son, and followed the boy with this envelope in his hand, but the boy turned into a shop. Alexander returned to Adamson, who gave him his hat and overcoat, when we arrested them. At the station they were charged with loitering for the purpose of committing, a felony. They made no reply to the charge. Subsequently they were put up, identified, and other charges of larceny preferred against them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Â£2 17s. 9 1/2 d., a metal watch and chain, metal stamp case, and metal ring and other articles were found upon Adam<lb/>son. I have no note of having seen Adamson on March 24. I went there, having appointed to meet other officers who were keeping obser<lb/>vation on the bank.</p>

After five minutes they went into Gracechurch Street, turned back, stood at the corner of Lombard Street, returned to Fenchurch Street, and shortly afterwards left, going down Lombard Street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had orders from my superior officer to go to the L. and S.W. Bank at Fenchurch Street owing to robberies from persons leaving banks having been reported. I came on duty at 2.45 p.m.</p>

I arrived there at about 3.50, received four Â£5 notes, and Â£10 in gold for the cheque, and left the bank, when Alexander, with his hat and overcoat off, came up to me, and said, "That cheque you just gave me was not endorsed. Take this" (handing me sealed envelope produced) "and give it to the governor. Give me the money and I will take it back to the bank." Thinking the cheque was in the envelope I gave him the money and went back to the office; when the envelope was opened we found it contained three blank telegraph forms.</p>

                  </hi>, inspector, Railway Omnibus Company, Limited. On March 24, at 3.45 p.m., I alighted from an omnibus I had inspected opposite the London, City and Midland Bank in Queen Victoria Street, when I saw the two prisoners. Adamson was looking in the doorway of the bank, Alexander was about three yards off on the pavement, and a third man was standing on the curb. Alexander walked towards Adamson, both looked into the bank and spoke to one another. A little after Miss Bish came out. The two prisoners and the third man closed up and followed her. When outside Ormonde House, Queen Victoria Street, Alexander went into the doorway, took his hat and overcoat off and gave them to Adamson to hold, then went forward and followed Bish. I lost sight of them as they passed the Mansion House Station, but following into Cannon Street I saw Alexander talking to her. He was tapping her on the arm with a pencil which he had in his hand. He bowed to her and left her; I saw she had a long envelope in her hand. Alexander then walked back to Ormonde House, where the other two were standing, received his hat and coat and put them on. The following Saturday I picked the two pri<lb/>soners out from amongst nine other men at the station. I am sure they are the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I particularly noticed the three men because they were acting suspiciously. I wear spectacles as I am short-sighted; I could see distinctly. Adamson wore a long dark overcoat with a velvet collar, something like a motor-coat, of a kind of mixture, and a bowler hat. I was at the Mansion House when the prisoners were about to be brought up in a taxi-cabâthe officer asked me to go round to the back of the Mansion House, as it would not be right for me to see them. Brown certainly did not bring me back to identify them in the taxi-cab. I was brought into the room, and picked them both out without hesitation from a number of others. I gave a description of the prisoners to Police-constable Brown. I said Adamson was dressed in rather darkish clothes, with a bowler hat, smart appearance, dark, about 5 ft. 7 in., or 8 in. Alexander was shorterâabout 5 ft. 7 in., both clean shaven. I am positive they are the men.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I never saw Adamson from March 24 until I picked him out at the Mansion House.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). On March 24 I was not with Alexander. I was not in the City until 4.30 or later. I am not guilty of this crime. On March 24 I met a friend named Harris at the "Spaten Bar," Piccadilly Circus, at 2.30. Harris had two rugs to dispose of, which I took to Madame Cora, a friend of my wife's at 38, Shaftes<lb/>bury Avenue, sold them to her for 32s. 6d., left her at about 3.20, and met Harris at the "Prince Rupert." We then went together to Butler's Restaurant, where we each had tea, bread and butter, and eggs. We had a dispute about the profit I was entitled to, I claiming 5s. and he saying I was only to have half-a-crown. We were there half an hour; left together, when Harris hailed a taxi-cab, and asked me to accompany him as he knew I was going to the City, as I had an appointment at Houndsditch at 5 p.m. I arrived in the City at about 4.10. I was wearing a light fawn overcoat. I had nothing to do with the robbery, and received none of the proceeds from Alexander. I was arrested on March 31 as stated. The two envelopes containing tele<lb/>gram forms which were then found upon me were handed to me by Alexander to hold while he went into a cigarette shop. I placed them in my pocket. Neither of those nor the one found on Alexander were directed in my hand-writing. I have never been convicted of any crime.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I sell goods for Harris, and he occasionally sells goods for me. I have known Alexander since last July. I did not tell this story at the police-court. I told Gunner that I could prove I was not there. Gillies's statement is absolutely untrue.</p>

The man having left the girl went back to Ormonde House, put on his hat and coat, and all three went down Queen Victoria Street. He described the three men as follows: The first, aged 28 to 30, 5 ft. 7 in. or 8 in. in height. dark hair and com<lb/>plexion, clean shaven, stiff build, dressed in long brownish tweed overcoat with strap at back, blue serge suit, bowler hat, collar and tie.</p>

               <p>The second man, aged 28 to 30, 5 ft. 7 in. or 8 in., hair and complexion dark, clean haven, dressed in long brownish overcoat with strap at back, collar and tie, bowler hat. The third man, aged 23 to 25, height 5 ft. 9 in., hair dark, rather curly, complexion fresh, clean shaven, slim build, dressed in grey overcoat, collar and tie, bowler hat; smart appearance and apparently Jews.</p>

                  </hi>, 29, Maiden Street, Burdett Road, job-stock buyer, corroborated Adamson. The rugs were sold for 32s. 6d., and having cost 15s., Adamson claimed 8s. 9d. as his half of the profit, but he owed me a few shillings and I refused to give him more than 5s. We left Butler's Restaurant at about four in a "W. and G." taxi-cab. I have seen the driver since, but could not get him to come here to give evidence. We arrived at Lombard Street at 4.30 p.m. I am sure this was March 24, because I had a bet on the horse Rory O'More and lost it.</p>

                  </hi>, manageress, Butler's Restaurant, 23, Newport Court, Charing Cross Road. Adamson is a frequent visitor at my restaurant. On March 24, at 3.15 p.m., he came in with Harris; they had tea and eggs; they had a dispute over 5s., and left about 4 p.m. I recollect the day because it was the day before Quarter Day; they left just before I took tea over to the Hippo<lb/>drome, which I regularly do at 4 p.m.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I sometimes take tea to the Hippodrome at 3.30. I only know Harris by sight as a customer. He asked me to give evi<lb/>dence yesterday; he said I might prove something about where Harry (Adamson) was. I cannot say how I knew that I was asked about March 24âit was the first time Harris was ever in my shop. The two prisoners have been together at my restaurant.</p>

               <p>Mr. R. Ernest Dummett, who appeared to prosecute, said that pri<lb/>soner was first married on December 12, 1867, and his real wife was still alive. On November 5, 1910, he went to lodge at Chiswick with Sybil Rhoda Duncombe, the woman he afterwards bigamously married. On December 4 he answered an advertisement inserted by Ellen Gordon Sweetman, who was seeking a position as nurse. He went to see her at Kingston-on-Thames, and described himself. as Major-General Mackenzie, a surgeon-general in the Army. He said he was now a medical specialist, and that he had answered this adver<lb/>tisement because he wanted Miss Sweetman to come as a nurse. He also subsequently described himself as the Duke of St. Omars. The woman was completely deceived, and accepted his invitation to go as nurse and housekeeper for Â£200 a year. She left her house at Kingston and went to Surbiton with him, and he very soon persuaded her to withdraw her savings, amounting to Â£170, from the post office. He took Â£150 of this amount, and on January 2 he married her at St. Mary's Church, Somers Town. He lived with her until January 28, and he then left her and went back to the Duncombes at Chiswick, and on February 2 he went through a form of marriage with Miss Dun<lb/>combe, who described herself as an artist. They lived together until February 27. He also imposed on the people with whom he lodged at Surbiton, and got sums of money from them. They obviously believed he was Major-General Mackenzie and the Duke of St. Omars, and it was clear that Miss Sweetman believed it, because in getting the Â£150 from her he gave her a receipt in which she was described as the Right Hon. Countess of St. Omars, and he signed himself as Surgeon-General</p>

The police first knew of the prisoner in 1893, when, as Viscount John Hutchinson Vaughan, in the peer<lb/>age of Ireland, he became acquainted with a widowed lady at South<lb/>ampton. He contracted a bigamous marriage with her on Septem<lb/>ber 10, 1893. There is a long list of convictions up against him: In June, 1894, he called upon two sisters in Bayswater and engaged apartments as the Right Hon. George E. Moles worth, of Glynn Castle, Ross-shire, Scotland. He offered one of the ladies marriage and said he would settle Â£500 a year on her and Â£1,000 a year on his death, together with the house and lands known as Braemore, Ross-shire, Scotland.</p>

                  </persName>, F Division. On March 15 I saw prisoner at Elizabeth Street, Belgravia. I told him I was a police officer and held a warrant for his arrest. He said, "What for" I replied, "For obtaining a situation by means of a false character." He said, "I must admit it was false, but I must have been a fool as I had got such good references." When charged he made no reply. He was afterwards charged with forging a character in the name of Clifford. When the charge was read over he said, "I know nothing of the damage to the car, but the letters I do. I went to the address at Kingston. It was a small stationer's and toyshop. I also went to the Uxbridge address; that was a small confectioner's."</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have made the inquiries in this case. Prisoner has borne a high character. I saw Lady Talbot, and found that he had been employed by Lord Edmund Talbot from November, 1909, to December, 1910. She said at times he was a bit rude, but otherwise gave him an excellent character as a driver. His Lordship was ill at the time. I have seen the character Lord Talbot wrote, and it was on the strength of that that prisoner obtained a fresh license. I made inquiries at two other places, where they spoke highly of him.</p>

He told me that in driving to chambers to meet me he had knocked over acci<lb/>dentally a lady whose name is first on this list of names and addresses and he said what is perfectly true, that it was not his fault. As I had to give notice to the insurance company I asked him to write out a list of the witnesses and he later on handed me this list. In my opinion, Exhibits 1, 3 and 4 are in the same writing.</p>

I asked him to come on the Tuesday and arranged if he was satis<lb/>factory I would then take up his reference. On the Friday or Satur<lb/>day I asked my husband if he was satisfied and then wrote to that address. I received Exhibit 1 in reply. I gave defendant notice to leave on March 1 and was looking out for a new chauffeur. Cambery came to see me on March 9. He gave a reference, but I did not</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am a driver<lb/>mechanic. I have been 11 years in the business. Until about 18 months ago I held a hackney carriage licence. I held a motor-cab licence for about eight months. I lost it because I did not obey the regulations. Instead of depositing within 24 hours an umbrella that was left in the cab, I deposited it some weeks after, and my licence was stopped for a time. I have got it back now. I was in the employ of Mr. Charles Campbell about 19 months. He died. He gave me a character before he went abroad. I was with Mr. Smith in Scotland about two years. He gave me a character when I left. I then went back into the works for a time and went on other jobs. I filled in three years with Mr. Cummings. I obtained my license to drive a motor cab with him. In November, 1909, I went to Lord Edmund Talbot. I lost my license while with him. At the time I applied for this situation with Mr. Atkin I had a number of characters from the gentlemen I have spoken of. I had not one from Lord Edmund Talbot; I have one now. The reason I did not get one before was because he went abroad on account of his health and I could not get his address. I saw his butler, who said he could not do anything until he heard from his lordship. That being so, I went and saw Mrs. Atkin and gave her the address of Marshall, Richmond Road, Kingston, which was a false address. I have never been to Richmond Road, Kingston. I got the piece of paper, Exhibit 1, from Cambery, who had letters addressed there. I wrote Exhibit 1 because I could not get a letter from Lord Edmund Talbot. I know nothing what<lb/>ever</p>

                  </hi>, K.C. About January last prisoner was in my service as chauffeur. His wages were Â£2 5s. a week, with rooms over the garage, which I believed then that he occupied. During the period from January to the end of February 20 petrol cans were missing which should have been returned to Harrods' Stores. My wife gave him notice on my behalf, which notice expired on March 11. A boy named Leney was employed in housework, knives, and boots. The police were called in to trace the theft of the cans. They were there on March 9. Leney was told to go that day. When prisoner entered my service I had a Delaunay car; afterwards I bought a Unic, a new car. In October the Delaunay had been done up entirely by the Clement Company, but it was not giving satisfac<lb/>tion; the axle was not as quiet as it ought to have been. I told Kelly to take it back for the purpose of having it attended to. On March 6 it came back and between the 6th and 11th I used it regularly. It ran quite smoothly. On the 11th he drove me to the Temple at 9.30 a.m. When I got out of the car I told him to go back to the house and see my wife. He asked me about the rooms. I said, "I sup<lb/>pose you are going to clear out to-day," and he said, "I was going to speak to you about that; can't I have till Tuesday? I have not been able to get another room," or "we have not been able to." I said really I could not; he had had 10 days' notice and there was a new man coming in and I wanted him out. When the Delaunay was sent to the Clements works nothing had to be done to the engine at all.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Petrol cans were missed before Kelly came. Leney had been in my employ two years or longer. A charge was made against defendant in regard to the Unic car before any charge had been made as regards the Delaunay car, and he had been com<lb/>mitted for trial in regard to the Unic. The Delaunay car was away and the damage had not been discovered. I gave instructions to my clerk to go to the garage on the 11th on receiving a telephone message from my wife. I did not know that the key of the garage was left behind the petrol tank when the garage was shut up. The petrol tank is just outside the wall of the garage. Before Kelly came I had one chauffeur on trial and another temporarily from the Delaunay Company. The previous chauffeur had been with me about a year. It was during his time that some of the petrol cans had gone. There</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250043"/>
               <p>are a good many other garages in this mews, perhaps 20. Betweew March 14 and 23 I should think the Delaunay car did 180 miles. I did not pay Kelly his wages when he left.</p>

                  </persName>. On March 9 a man named Cambery came to me for a situation. Prisoner was under notice. I did not engage Cambery. On March 11 I expected Kelly to call at the house for me at 10.30 a.m. As he did not call I went to the garage and found him there. He had got the bonnet of the car open. I asked him why he had not come round. He said, "I was just going to." There were two other men looking into the car. I think one was Cambery; he had his back to me. I had engaged another chauffeur, who was coming at two o'clock. I telephoned to my husband. I asked him to send someone to help me as it was not very pleasant. He sent his clerk, Albert Hamer. Before I telephoned I had noticed a scratch on the door of the car. I said the car had been damaged. Kelly said, "You do not think I would do such a thing as damage your car." At 12.30 Harrods' man was there taking an inventory. Kelly was very angry; he said he had never had such a thing done before as to have an inventory taken and it was enough to turn an honest man into a thief. I cannot remember all he said; he said a great many things; I gathered I had such a reputation that no one would enter my service. He said he could bring a witness. He opened the door and asked a man to come. I said to the man, "I think I know you; you are the man who has been after the place this morn<lb/>ing"; that was Cambery. I said, "Rather an unfortunate witness if the place is so bad that your friend should come after it."On March 12 I started to go to Sevenoaks with the new chauffeur. Directly we got to Vauxhall Bridge I noticed the car was going badly. It got worse and worse. At Lewisham it stopped; the chauffeur got out; he said we could not go any further. I remember the Delaunay car going away and coming back. (Witness deposed to the mileage made by the car.)</p>

                  </hi>, chauffeur to Mr. Atkin. I went to the garage about two o'clock on March 11. I got the key of the garage from Mrs. Atkin. I had a slight conversation with Kelly. I was greasing up at the time. He said, You won't want to grease up; I have greased and oiled everywhere. I looked at the oil tank; it was full. This was the Unic car. On March 12 we started for Sevenoaks. The car broke down five times. The car was towed to the Unic works. I saw the engine opened. At the bottom of the crank case there was a sediment like emery powder. Emery powder could not get there by accident. I did not put the powder there. On the 14th I fetched the Delaunay from the Clement works. It went back again on the 23rd. It was kept locked up in the garage. Nobody could get at it. When I first took the Delaunay from the works I complained of the engine knocking; it gradually got worse. I mentioned it to Mrs. Atkin; she thought it should be seen to. I drove it 150 to 170 miles; it may have been 180. On the 23rd I drove it to the Clement works. It was stored two days before anybody could attend to it. Nobody could have put emery powder into it while it was in my care.</p>

The back axle was wrong. I did not see the car again. On March 11 when I drove Mr. Atkin to the Temple in the Unio car it went all right. I went straight back to the stable, as I always did, and left it outside the coach-house in the usual place. When I got there two men came up to me at once and a man was outside who had come to put on locks. The other men were Cambery and Good. The lock<lb/>smith started to do the doors and when he opened the doors I put the car in. Immediately afterwards Mrs. Atkin came, also the clerk; he said he would stay there till I cleared out. I never at any time put anything into either of the cars.</p>

He had told me that he had had a row with Liz; he said he was going to do himself in and Liz on pension day. About six o'clock I saw him again and he said, "I have done Liz in"; he showed me and Rowley, who was with me, his hands and clothes, all smeared with blood; he said he hit her with a hammer and cut her throat; he said he was going to give himself up.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. In the week before the murder I had noticed prisoner's strange manner; he seemed a changed man. He had been in the Army and served in India; since he came home he was 17 weeks in the infirmary with the ague.

                  </hi>, coroner's officer for the Eastern Division, produced the signed deposition made by prisoner at cue inquest held before Mr. Wynne Baxter on March 28. Prisoner, after being cautioned, said that up to March 19 he and Kempster had always been happy together and never quarrelled." On that day, about 5 p.m., deceased came from her mother's upstairs to her own room. She seemed downhearted. I said, 'What is the matter, girl?' She said, 'Nothing.' I said, 'Yes, there is; I can see it. Tell me what it is.' She would not. I was upset myself. About 8 p.m. she said, 'Let's go downstairs and see father and mother, sister Lou, and Bob.' She said, 'Wipe your eyes,' as I had been crying through the worry of her not telling me what was the matter. Then she said, 'Never mind, we won't go out to-night. We will have a drink indoors instead.' I went to get a pint and a half in a jug. We sat upstairs and drank it. After we drank the beer she said, 'I wish you would go.' I said, 'Go where? 'She said, 'Go and leave me.' I said, 'Why?' She said, 'I'll work and keep the child.' I said, 'Who have you been with?' She said, 'Mind your own business.' I said, 'Do you mean me to go?' She said, 'Yes, and try and forget me.' I said, 'That I can never do.' She said, 'You must try.' No more was said that night. About 6.30 a.m. Monday I got up and had breakfast. I asked her, 'Are you in the same mood as you were last night?' She would not answer. She walked out of the room; never said good-morning nor nothing. I then dressed the boy, sent him to his grand-ma's. Then took my suit and pawned it for 12s. Met her at 2.30. We went in the 'Grasshopper' and had a drink. She said, 'Hello, where did you get that money'? I said, 'Pawned my suit for 12s.' She said, 'How much have you got left?' I said, 'About 8s. or 9s.' She said, 'Give it to me, you don't want to spend it.' I gave her about 8s. 6d. She gave me about 2s. back. She said, 'That</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250048"/>
               <p>will be enough for you to get on with to-day. If you want any more come to me.' She went back into work. I went-home. I went and met her coming from work at night. On Tuesday she came home from work. I poured out a cup of tea for her. She said, 'I do not want it.' I said, "What's the matter?' She pointed to the door and said, 'Go; the trouble I've got into I'll face. I can work and keep myself and the child.' With that she laid on the sofa. I tried to get her to speak, but she would not answer me. I saw her on the Wednesday. I stood by her. She would not speak to me again. Thursday and Friday the same. Saturday afternoon" about 2 p.m. I saw her in Whitechapel Road going into the 'Old Red Lion' public-house. I looked at her. She laughed at me. I walked down into the public-house to her. I said, 'Lizzie, you're driving me mad.' No answer. I said to her, 'Would you take my papers in next Satur<lb/>day morning?' She nodded her head. I left her there. A little later I went back to the public-house, where I saw deceased and another woman whom she works with. I called for a glass of ale, sat down, and said to her, 'Think of what you are doing, Lizzie.' She wouldn't answer me. I said, 'Look at me.' She would not look at me. I said, 'Are you afraid to look at me?' She said, 'I'm afraid of no one.' We came out. She went home. I walked up and down the road, went round to Mrs. Miller, 155, Montague Street, Vallance Road, and asked her to loan me 2s. 6d. She did so. I then made my way to Aldgate till I got to a stall, where I bought a razor for eighteen pence. I then went to Glasshouse Street, and met deceased there. She said, 'What do you want?' I said, 'I want you and nothing else.' She said 'You're mad.' We went upstairs. She lit the fire, made the tea, cooked two rashers of bacon, three eggs. We sat down and had tea together. I said to her, 'Have you con<lb/>sidered?' She says, 'Yes.' I said, 'What is it to be, are we to live together or apart?' She said, 'Apart.' Then I said, 'Nothing but death shall part us.' I picked up the hammer what was in the fire<lb/>place, hit her on the temple. She fell, and her words were, 'Oh, my, don't.' I drawed the razor across her throat, knelt down by the side of her, kissed her, and said 'Good-bye, we shall meet above.' I then left the room. I went towards Mansell Street, threw the razor and came away. I walked about for a time till I met some one I knew (Crease), and stated to him as already has been stated by the witnesses.... I then went to Lemon Street Station and gave myself up."</p>

                  </hi>, clerk, Secretary's Office, G.P.O. For four or five months there were complaints of losses of letters passing through the Eastern District office, at which prisoner was employed as a postman, and in the middle of March I commenced making inquiries. I suspected prisoner and on March 28 I made up a test packet containing a letter, 12 penny postage stamps, and a pair of sleeve links, which I put into a match-box which I wrapped in brown paper securely tied with string. I fixed a label to the packet, which I addressed to "H. Murray, 18, Marlborough Road, Clapham Common." I had marked the stamps and the links. I showed the 'packet to Wilson and Hellicar, two overseers at the office, and at 10.40 a.m. on March 29 I posted it outside, giving certain instructions to Wilson. About 12 noon Wilson made a report to me and I saw prisoner about 3 p.m. I told him who I was and that I was making inquiries about missing letters. I first cautioned him, described the packet to him, and stated that I had posted it; that it had been placed before him to be dealt with and that it could not be found. I asked him what he had done with it. He said, "I have not seen it." At my request he turned out his pockets and produced this snuff box, which contained these 14 penny stamps. He said, "I bought them about a fortnight ago. There were two shillings' worth." I developed my mark on three of the stamps in his presence. I said, "I identify these stamps as those enclosed in the packet I described to you. Have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250050"/>
               <p>you any explanation to offer of your possession of them?" He said, "I bought two shillings' worth a fortnight ago. There are no others, than those in the little box." He went on to say, "I found some on a sorting table this morning at about 11.30. These must be the ones." I said, "You know it was your duty to hand up any loose stamps found in the sorting office," and he said, "I was not aware of the fact. I suppose by rights I should have done so." All the post<lb/>men have a printed copy oil the rules, which they are supposed to make themselves acquainted with. I asked him what had become of the sleeve links, and he said, "I have not seen them." He was taken to the G.P.O., where he was given into custody. On the next day Sergeant Walker handed me these sleeve links (produced), which I identify as the ones I put into the packet.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. You said that the whole of the 14 stamps were part of those that you had purchased.</p>

On March 29 Mr. Austin showed me the test packet and gave me certain instructions. At 10.40 a.m. I made a collection at the office and found the test packet, which I put in on a sorting table to be dealt with in the usual way; it should have gone eventually to the basket for Homerton. Later I looked in the basket and did not find it. Prisoner was engaged with two or three others in sorting the collection, and amongst others he would have to sort the Homerton parcels. I made a report to Mr. Austin.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Frederick Meek, 15, Bush berry Road, Homer<lb/>ton. I am caretaker of 16, Bushberry Road At 7.15 a.m. on Feb<lb/>ruary 22 I was coming up my passage when I heard the street door go of No. 16, which is next door. I ran and opened my front door and saw prisoner leaving the last step of No. 16. There are no rail<lb/>ings between those steps and mine; they are next to each other. He had a parcel under his arm. He ran into the gutter and I called after him." All rightâyou dirty swine!" He took a running walk to the other side of the road and then turned round. I saw his face. He went on four or five yards and then turned again. I saw his face again sideways. He was dressed in a darkish grey cap, a tight-fitting brown coat, and a dark pair of trousers. He went straight on to the top of Bushberry Road. I went into No. 16 and found the long pipe with two brackets in the middle of the parlour ceiling gone. The gas meter was partly pulled away. I had last seen them at 9.45 the previous evening. I gave a description of prisoner to the police the same day. On March 17 I picked him out from nine or 10 men; I went by his features; he had long features. I looked down the row three times and I picked him out. I said, "That is like the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250052"/>
               <p>man." He had different clothing on. I am positive now he is the man, I saw him the 22nd.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I do not know why I called after him except that I was suspicious. I could see him clearly across the street. Although there was no sun, there was a good light. My daughter, who was not fully dressed, was behind me when he turned round. The reason I did not follow him was because I had to get breakfast for my family. I did not go to the police then because I knew the landlord was collect<lb/>ing the rent at 10 o'clock and I thought I would tell him. I told his brother at a little after 10. Prisoner took off his overcoat that he was wearing before I identified him. The parcel he was carrying was about a foot long. I do not know if the things that were missing could be got into a parcel that size.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I had never seen prisoner before this.</p>
               <p>(To the Court.) The back door was closed but not bolted, and a person could get in, but he would have to come over the railway.</p>

                  </hi>, daughter of last witness, 15, Bushberry Road. On the morning of February 22 I was in the kitchen when I heard the door close next door. I called to my mother, and as I called she ran up the passage and opened the street door. I followed her, when I saw prisoner leaving the kerb and crossing the street. He was carry<lb/>ing a bulky brown paper parcel. Mother called to him and he looked round. I saw him side face. He had a tight-fitting brown coat on. On March 17 I picked him out from nine or 10 men at once. I said that he was the man, but that I might tell him better by his back and he turned round. I noticed that when I saw him he was very broad-shouldered and tall. I identified him by his face.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. My mother was in the washhouse when I called her and it would not take her a minute to get to the front door. I did not see him full face. I was looking over my mother's shoulder when I saw him. I noticed that his features were thin. It was a fine morning and there was plenty of light. It was not a very large parcel he had.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The two front doors are quite close. You can hear the door bang from our kitchen.</p>

At 11 p.m. on March 17 I saw prisoner in Mare Street and told him I should take him into custody on suspicion of stealing gasfittings from 16, Bushberry Road. He said, "I do not know anything about it." On the way to the station he said, "I hope you will not keep me there all night." I said, "We shall get the witness and put you up for identification as soon as possible." Nothing of importance was found on him. When charged he said, "I am perfectly innocent of the charge."</p>

                  </persName>, J Division. I was present when the witnesses identified prisoner. He was placed with 10 other men of similar dress and stature. Mrs. Meek looked along the line for about two minutes, touched prisoner and said, "I think this is the man." She was told to be careful. Prisoner turned round and she said, "That is the man. He was wearing a tight coat at the time." He was wearing a dark overcoat, which he took off and put on again. Edith Meek was then brought in. She looked along the line for about a minute and then went over to him and said, "I should know him better from his back as he had his back to me when I first saw him." He took off his overcoat and turned round. He then said, "That is the man. I saw his face after he turned round and looked at me." Later prisoner said, pointing to Mrs. Meek, "The lady said I was wearing a tight-fitting coat. I can prove I never had one." I have often seen him wearing a tight-fitting suit, but not recently.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Prisoner stated before the magistrate that he was so hard up on February 22 that he had got a friend to pawn a pair of boots. This was true.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards submitted that there was no case to go to the Jury, there being insufficient evidence of identification. The Jury were invited to state their view and they returned a verdict of <rs id="t19110425-56-verdict-1" type="verdictDescription">

In June, 1910, I met prisoner at the Cafe Royale in London, when conversation arose with regard to the trial of Count d'Aulby at Tours. Prisoner said he knew that Mrs. Paine (the prosecutrix in that case) had written some very compromising letters to d'Aulby and that she was wrong to have put him in prison as he would use the letters when he came</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250054"/>
               <p>out of prison and would be abe to get a lot of money by giving the letters back; that the letters had been sent to London to avoid their seizure by the French police, that here were about 200 letters written in English which had been translated into French at a cost of Â£48; that he (prisoner) had seen the letters and had been asked to take them to Paris, he had refused to do so; that a friend of prisoner's had some of them in his possession and that they had been photographed with prisoner's camera. I am acquainted with Madame Rhim, the companion of prosecutrix, and communicated with her. I again saw prisoner in October at the Caf?e Paris, Haymarket. I told him I did not believe what he said about the letters. He said he would send a photograph of one of them to me in Paris. He afterwards wrote letter produced of November 25, stating that he could not send the photograph as the person who had it wanted money before he would part with it. Prisoner gave me an order for wine for the King of Montenegro.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I never met prisoner until June, 1910. The conversation about the d'Aulby case was started by another gentleman at the Cafe Royal. Prisoner afterwards spoke to me separatelyâwe were talking perhaps 10 minutes. I did not know Mrs. Paine per<lb/>sonallyâshe was a customer of my firm. I met prisoner at Lausanne when he asked me to lend him Â£50 and also to change a bill of exchange, which I refused to do. In November I saw prisoner twiceâI introduced the conversation about the letters. Prisoner told me he knew the solicitor who had the letters.</p>

(Mr. Curtis Bennett objected to evidence about d'Aulby, as there was no connection shown between him and the prisoner. Evidence admitted, subject to proof being subsequently given of the connection.) D'Aulby was represented in England by Berin and Rodier, solicitors, 17, Sackville Street, and in Paris by their agent, Mr. Boddington, and by Maitre Alain, and Maitre Maurice Bernhart. On May 25, 1910, I saw Alain and Bod<lb/>dington in Paris, who showed me typewritten translations of a number of letters from Mrs. Paine to d'Aulby. Alain proposed that we should purchase the originals for 175,000 francs.</p>

Alain advised me to persuade Mrs. Paine that it was in her interest to pur<lb/>chase these letters for the sake of her reputation among the American colony. I returned letters the next morning. D'Aulby was tried in December, 1910, at Tours. A number of original copies of transla<lb/>tions of letters were handed over to Maitre Deschenes, avoues or Mrs. Paine, and it was arranged between the avoues of both sides that all letters from Mrs. Paine to d'Aulby should be returned to her and she would withdraw from the prosecution. I was not present at the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250055"/>
               <p>discussionâit was between the solicitors. On January 10 or 12 Maitre Deschenes brought me a large bundle of letters, which I compared with a list I had taken of the copies handed to me by Alain in May. I then found that the original of the letter of January 1, 1909, was missing, but appended to the copy was a note that the original had been sent to Boston. The missing letter was afterwards handed to me on February 12. D'Aulby on January 14, 1911, was sentenced to one month's imprisonment and ordered to pay the costs of the prosecution. The conviction was recorded with regard to the fraudu-lent sale of one picture.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I am the editor of a legal paper. After the death of Mr. Paine, d'Aulby had made a claim for Â£40,000 against Paine's executors for pictures alleged to have been sold to Paine. Mrs. Paine then brought an action against d'Aulby on the ground that the pictures sold were all faked, and particularly claiming 75,000 francs for one called "L'Antiope"; she also claimed 315,000 francs for money paid to d'Aulby for pictures. All matters were settled on the condition that the letters were delivered up.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. D'Aulby did not commence an action against Mrs. Paineâhe made a claim on the executora in Boston.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Gaston Duc de Choiseul, 33, Avenue Bois de Boulogne, Paris. I was formerly married to Charles Hamilton Paine, of Boston, U.S., who died in 1909. Before his death I was acquainted with the Countess d'Aulby de Gatinez and was afterwards introduced to her husband, Count d'Aulby. Mr. Paine and I took a house in Paris, which we furnished, buying a number of pictures from d'Aulby, and at his request we took charge of a number of others in order to save d'Aulby the cost of warehousing and insurance. At Mr. Paine's death d'Aulby claimed Â£40,000 for the pictures which we had taken charge of and which he alleged had been sold to Paine. In valuing for probate the valuation was made of the pictures sold to us and in March, 1910, I commenced civil pro-ceedings against d'Aulby. In April a criminal charge was made against d'Aulby; he remained in custody until January 14, 1911. During Paine's life time he and I corresponded with d'Aulby. I was not a party to any bargaining for the purchase of the letters. Meetings took place between the solicitors at Tours and I ultimately agreed to withdraw from both the civil and criminal proceedings on all the letters being delivered up. I never entertained any offer to give him a sum of money for the letters. After I withdrew, the crimi<lb/>nal prosecution, which was conducted by the Public Prosecutor at Tours, was concluded, and d'Aulby was sentenced to one month's imprisonment and to pay the costs of the prosecution. The picture, "L'Antiope," was bought by Paine for 75,000 francs as a genuine Carot. The cross-examination of this witness was reserved.</p>

                  </persName>, New Scotland Yard. On Decem<lb/>ber 6 I received a warrant at Marylebone Police Court and on Decem<lb/>ber 12 I with two other officers saw prisoner at 189, Goldhawk Road. I said, "We are police officers. Is your name Count Tscherniadieff?" He said, "Yes, that is my name." I said, "I have a warrant for your arrest," which I read to him. He said, "I do not know Count d'Aulby, but he is in prison in France." Turning to a lady who was present he said d'Aulby's accuser was his lover or mistress, but she charged him with obtaining 200,000 francs from her about some pic<lb/>tures. Prisoner then asked to be allowed to write a cheque for the lady and also for his solicitor, which he did. I took possession of a quantity of papers and took him to the station. He asked me to communicate to his solicitor, Berens. Among the papers is a quantity of notepaper of various foreign hotels, of the Junior Constitutional Club, and of the Portland Hotel. In a pocket-book is the name "Duc de Choiseul" and the address of his advocate "Maitre Plumont, 16, Avenue de Friedland, Paris," also an envelope addressed to Count d'Aulby de Gatinez, having on the back the address of Madame Hamilton Paine, 33, Avenue de Bois de Boulogne, Paris. While the d'Aulby case was going on I was instructed by the Foreign Office to make inquiries with regard to Count d'Aulby, and I have established his identity.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The prosecution of d'Aulby was what we call a private prosecution. Prisoner spoke to me in English.</p>

                  </hi>, 48, Commercial Road, Lambeth. I am porter to W. H. Smith and Sons, Fetter Lane branch. On April 6 I was loading up vans. Prisoner was there. I was assisting in loading his van. Wayre was not there then. I saw him just before that with prisoner. I heard prisoner say, "If there is any chance of getting a bundle I will have it." I did not say anything. There were 10 bundles inside the door in Bartlett's Passage to be loaded on Traynor's van. They were checked as they came out by Lloyd. I loaded eight, then Traynor handed him a bundle off the van. Carroll took it away. I went in and gave information to Lloyd. Before Traynor whistled he asked me where the governor was; I said he was inside. After the parcel had disappeared I got the book from Lloyd and handed it to Traynor. After I put the ninth one on Traynor said, "I have got eight bundles now and I have only a ticket for seven. I told him to see Lloyd about it. Mr. Willmot, the overseer of the warehouse, had then gone after Carroll. Traynor went to the warehouse to rectify his book. Carroll is not in Smiths' employ. I have seen him on Traynor's van before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Carroll was in the employ of May and Son, who cart for Smiths'. Carroll does not carry bundles. He has left Mays' some time. If the delivery book showed a less number of parcels than was on the van it would be Traynor's duty to go in and rectify it, and inquiry would be made. I had carried out eight parcels. I did not walk away to fetch the ninth; I stayed at the van a little while; we generally have a blow for five minutes at the top of the court. I was about a yard from the van when Traynor whistled. Before he whistled he said, "Where is my boy?" meaning Carroll, who was at the bottom of the turning. I do not think I had said that before; I have only just thought of it. Traynor has a vanboy; it is not Carroll. I saw Carroll standing at the bottom of the court the previous morning. The words Traynor used when he asked where the governor was were, "Is Mr. Willmot there?" He also said "the governor." When Carroll came up after Traynor whistled Traynor gave a bundle to him and told him to put it on his shoulder. Carroll went down the street with it. It was not my duty to prevent him. I told Lloyd, "A bundle has just gone; if you send Willmot the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250058"/>
               <p>other side by Wallis's you will catch him." I did not tell Lloyd how it had gone; I told him that afterwards when he came back. Traynor was arrested two or three hours afterwards. He had been sent out on a jonrney. Willmot arrested Carroll.</p>

Wilkins was carrying them to the van. At first I had orders to check seven into it. The vans have to get out by a certain time and if we think we have time we sometimes put on more. The book was made out for seven bundles. I told Traynor I had checked nine in. I had orders to give another three, as there was plenty of time. The number on the delivery note would be in<lb/>creased. I should not make out a fresh one. Wilkins would hand that to the carman. I have seen Carroll in Traynor's van; he had no right to be there. After Wilkins had taken the eighth bundle out he made a communication to me and I informed the overseer. I went to the van. There were eight bundles there; I had checked nine.</p>

I saw him that day; Traynor pointed him out to me; he was standing at the bottom end of the street, where he could see the vans. Traynor said, "There is the fellow that will take the bundle away for me." This was about an hour before the bundle was stolen. I saw Traynor again just as they were fetching in Carroll; he said, "It is all up now; what shall I do?" He then went down the court.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. On April 6 at 2.30 I saw Traynor in Bartlett's Buildings; another officer was with me; I said to Traynor, "We are police officers; I must caution you to be careful what you say. Did you see anyone remove a parcel from your van this morning." He replied, "I did not see the parcel stolen; I must have left my van at the time; I never touched it." I said, "I under-stand you know a man named Carroll." He said, "Yes, I do know him." Then I told him he would be confronted with another man. He was then confronted with Wilkins, who said, "That is the man; he handed the parcel to Carroll." The accused said, "You never saw me hand the parcel to Carroll; it is a lie; I never touched it"; and then to me he said, "I found I had eight parcels on my van and my book showed I should only have seven, and I went to Mr. Shaw and told him I had one more than I ought to have."</p>

               <p>years in the Royal Horse Artillery. On April 6 I got to Bartlett's Passage at 8.30, and at once reported myself. I didnot say anything about assisting anybody to steal a parcel. While Wilkins was load<lb/>ing the van I was smoking a cigarette at the back of the van. I was not there all the time. I went to the men's lavatory, which is some distance off. Wilkins is not correct when he says that after placing a parcel on the van he stood for a blow. I did not handle any of the parcels. I didnot give one to Carroll. The delivery book was brought to me after I came from the lavatory. I then counted the parcels; there were eight on the van and the book said seven. I went to make my way to the warehouse to find the manager to inform him of the mistake; he came through the door. I told him. We west to the van; he took the book off me and went searching for the checker, Lloyd. The bundles were taken off my van. I was told to go to the front yard and put types on for the compositors' works at Tallis Street. Nothing was said to me about the missing parcel. I saw Mr. Willmot come up with Carroll. Wayre was not there then. I saw him after-wards, but did not speak. I did not say to him, "Things are all up now; what shall I do?" or anything like it. I first heard of the matter from Inspector Hine.</p>

                  </hi>, 27, Percy Street, W. I was coming along Howland Street, Tottenham Court Road about 1 p.m. on April 13. I saw five men; prisoners were three of them. I know Wordsley well by his being pointed out as a barred man and being a terror to the neigh<lb/>bourhood. He calls himself one of the 10 terriers of London. There are 10 of them altogether. I got the police to eject him from the institute at Percy Street, where I am manager. He had no business to be there; he was a barred man. On April 13 he asked me for money for drinks; I gave him 6d.; they used an expression and said it was not enough and all five set about me and kicked me unmercifully. I have an arm I shall never be able to use again. Steer struck me first with his fist; Wordsley kicked me in the stomach; Bonner caught hold of this arm and twisted it and stopped me from defending myself. I got up half dazed; then Steer put his hand in my pocket ana took 11s. out of it. I blew a whistle after they kicked me; they ran. I informed the police at Tottenham Court Road Police Station. They asked if I would go and find them. We found them in the "Adam and Eve" public-house. I pointed out the three prisoners to the constables. This would be about three-quarters of an hour after the attack.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Huntly Jenkins. I have no grudge against Steer, nor he against me. I had not known him before. It all</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250060"/>
               <p>happened in about two minutes. The blow Steer gave me was not severe. He kicked me as well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Macdonald. I was speaking to a woman who asked me where the Charity Organisation Society was about a second or two before the attack. It was not in consequence of any<lb/>thing I said that the trouble was caused. I did not say to Wordsley, "Why have you winked at this woman?" or anything of the kind. He has demanded money from me before. I do not owe Wordsley Â£10, nor any money. I had not had any drink myself; I seldomtouch it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Bonner. I do not know you. You got hold of my arm and twisted it. I did not know the woman andhave not seen her since.</p>

Hepointed out the three prisoners to me and other officers. When they were arrested Wordsley said, "What, pinch 11s. from him; he never had it." On the way to the station Bonner said, "It was I who done it on him; he deserves all he has got." At the station they made no reply to the charge.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I am manager to my mother, who carries on a theatrical costumier's business at 22, Maiden Lane, Strand. she paid me my wages early this day, about 10.30 or 11 a.m.; Iintended going away for the week-end. I went home first, gave my wife 35s., and came out with the intention of buyingsome<lb/>thing. I had a lot of drink and met these people in Tottenham Court Road. We had just come out of a public-housein Whitfield Street and on the corner prosecutor was talking to a woman. I had got by him and looked round and saw Wordsley was speaking to him. I heard some angry words between them and saw Hill take his hat off and strike at Wordsley with it. Wordsley hit him and there was a general scrimmage. Hill kicked Wordsley on the leg, and Bonner ran across and hit him. Then Hill ran across into a shop and blew a whistle. I was not nearer than six yards off all the time. They walked off. I went to another public-house and had another drink. I did not hit Hill at all. There was no money taken from him. When I said to the officer, "Is he going to do it on us for 11s.," I meant "Does he mean</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250061"/>
               <p>to charge us with stealing 11s. from him." I was so indignant at the idea that he should charge us with stealing 11s. When the scrimmage took place I think there were three men there; there may have been four.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). This seems to be an old row between Mr. Hill and Wordsley. Coming out of the public-house I saw Wordsley having an argument with Hill. It appeared Hill went to strike Wordsley; I am not sure of that; I had had a lot of drink, but I saw they were having a fight. Hill made a kick at Wordsley, wherefore I went in the road, and that was all I done. At the police station Hill said Wordsley held his hands, I struck him and Steer went down his pockets. Then again he contradicted himself and said I held his hands, Wordsley struck him and Steer went down his pockets.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I was rather inebriated. I remember what happened most decidedly. I have known Hill two years. There have been several business transactions between us. He owes me close on Â£10 through bets. There is no truth in the state<lb/>ment that I demanded money from him, that he offered me 6d, and I refused it. We were coming out of the "Carpenter's Arms" at the corner of Howland Street and Whitfield Street; on the opposite corner Hill was standing talking to a woman. As I passed he said, "What are you winking at her for?" I said, "What do you mean? You always try to pick a row with me." He took his soft felt hat and hit me across the mouth. I struck him. He made a kick at me. Then one of the prisoners came across and said, "You cowardly dog," and struck him. I do not know which one it was. Hill ran across the road into a small shop. He blew his whistle or made an attempt to do so. I was talking to him, telling him what I thought of him. I did not want to renew the fight; I was quite satisfied. We walked away then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. The row arose two years ago. I am almost posi<lb/>tive I cross-examined Hill about the woman at the police court. My story there was the same as to-day.</p>

                  </hi>, theatrical manager, 111, Moore Park Road, Wal-ham Green. In November last I saw an advertisement offering employment in the theatrical line (Exhibit 4 produced). I do not think it was Exhibit 4; prisonerwas often putting that advertisement in. I called at 6, Lidlington Place, where I saw prisoner. He said his name was Joseph O'Brien, that he was a theatrical manager, that he had Â£5,000 behind a show called "The Shadow of a Crime," and that he had scenery stored at Manchester worth Â£60. He said that he used the one furnished room Ifound him in as his offices and that he lived at 58, Elgin Mansions, where he had a piano worth Â£100. He askedme whom I had been with and I gave him rences. I then left. He wrote me, asking me to call on him. I called and he said that I was the sort of man he wanted and offered to engage me for six months. I said I would sooner be engaged for a month because if we did not suit each other it would be easier to go. He agreed, but said I was very foolish. He said that as I should have money passing through my hands he would want Â£20 as security. It was</p>

               <p>arranged that I should receive Â£3 a week and Â£1 a week during the three weeks' rehearsals. About December 1 he sent for me again and he drew up this agreement (Exhibit 1) in my presence. I gave him Â£20 and he gave me this receipt (Exhibit 2). We both signed the agreement, which states that I deposit the sum of Â£20 security, which was to be returnable at the end of the tour or when I left his service. I believed everything that he said or I should not have given him the Â£20. I attended rehearsals almost daily for three weeks and on December 24 we went to Euston Station for Northwich. At his house that morning he borrowed a sovereign from me because he said he was short of the fares. We were one week at Northwich and then we went to Colchester, where we were three days. From there we went to Stratford, where we stayed one week. The tour broke up there for the want of money. Prisoner left, leaving the company stranded; they had to stop there as they were not paid and had no money. I received altogether as wages Â£2 for the six weeks. He returned the Â£1 I lent him at the end of the week. I asked him for the return of my deposit and he gave me an I.O.U. On February 3 I received from him this letter (Exhibit 3) stating, "I am prepared on condition you write and say you accept to pay you Â£15 on the 25th of this month and the other Â£5 two weeks after that date. Please write me by return and I will send you my I.O.U. as above." I agreed to that and he sent me his I.O.U. On February 21 I went to 6, Lidlington Place, and saw him. He did not pay me; he treated thematter as a joke. At Stratford he tried to raise a loan on the scenery. I know it was bought at Manchester, but he told me after the show broke up that it was on the hire system.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roome contended that the evidence did not support either count of the indictment. As to the first count, themoney had not been handed to prisoner on safe custody or trust since he was not bound to return it in specie (R. v. Hotine, 68 J.P., 143). As to the second count, in order to substantiate a charge of false pretences the prosecutor musthave intended to part with his property out and out, which was not the case here since prisoner had obtained the money on credit. (R. v. Coyne, 69 J.P., 151).</p>
               <p>Mr. Briggs, while admitting that the facts in R. v. Hotine were indistinguish<lb/>able from this case, contended that it was not good law (in re Bellencontre, 1891, 298 at p. 142); (R. v. Lord, 69 J.P., 467); that anything which was property within the Larceny Act, 1901, may be the subject of safe custody, or trust within that Act, and that to contend that moneywhich was not actually return<lb/>able in specie did not come within that Act was applying too narrow a defini<lb/>tion." Property" was defined in the Larceny Act of 1861 (which the Act of 1901 was meant to extend) as "Every description of real and personal pro<lb/>perty, money," etc. It was true that the decisions in R. v. Cooper (L.R. 2, C.C.R., 123), and in R. v. Newman (8, Q.B.D., 706) seemed against this con<lb/>tention, but they were inconsistent with the decision in R. v. Fullagar (1A Cox, 370) and, moreover, were given before the passing of the Larceny Act of 1901, which was passed to overcome many difficulties in the way of bringing offenders within the repealed sections 75 and 76 of the Larceny Act, 1861, Finally, if Mr. Roome's contention as to the first count was good, then, since the identical coins were not to be returned, the prosecutor had actually parted out and out with the possession of his property, this bringing prisoner within the second count.</p>
               <p>The Recorder stated that having regard to the careful decision of the Common Sergeant (after consultation with Mr. Justice Phillimore) in R. v. Hotine, he did not feel that there was sufficient to distinguish this case in order to have</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250064"/>
               <p>it reviewed, and he would therefore direct the Jury to acquit prisoner on the first count, but that in his opinion therewas evidence for the Jury on the second count; there may have been credit obtained, but money was obtained as well.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I call myself a theatrical manager, but I was not so with prisoner; I was simply engaged to look after his interests. The only experience I have had as theatrical manager was ten years ago when I held that post for sixmonths. I had nothing to do with the success or failure of this show, prisoner took the sole responsibility. I gave him myreferences and I presume he took them up. He was advertising daily and he would have as many as ten answers a day. He put a similar advertisement to the one which I answered after he engaged me. The one I answered was something to the effect of Ex<lb/>hibit 4. ("Stage, a young gentleman of refinement to learn duties of management in play of repute. Commence Christmas. Small pre<lb/>mium. Good salary. Tour guaranteed.") No premium was mentioned when I first saw prisoner. He did not ask me if I had come to learn the duties of management. He engaged all the artistes. He is knownunder four different names. He never showed me any contracts, he may have had two for the places to which we went. He gave me a Mr. Cockran as a reference, but I could not find him at the time. Prisoner afterwards made appointments withme and others he had not paid to meet him at this man's house, but he never kept them. I cannot say whether I told prisoner the extent of my experi<lb/>ence as a theatrical manager, but he could have got that from my references. I wascertainly competent for a company like his. Amongst other duties I had to see the people did not come in without paying and to see they all received checks. I had to look after his interests generally. It is true I said at the police court that I am competent to deal with theatrical printing, but I was not engaged in this case to do that. I know nothing whatever about printing. It was the manager's duty to attend to that and I was not manager. I should think a capital of about Â£300 would be required to run a piece like prisoner's. I do not see that it is ridiculous to say he said he had Â£5,000 invested in it; he said he had Â£5,000 behind it. He told everybody he had any amount of money in the show. He never told me that he had the scenery on the hire-purchase system; he said it belonged to him. He said he was lessee of the play. He did not borrow the sovereign from me in order to pay a salary; it was to help pay the fares. On the first night at Northwich the theatre was packed, and for part of the time I took the tickets. I do not remember his complaining tome that although the theatre was full only Â£14 13s. had been taken. That is all he could have expected to take; it was only a wood and iron building. He never said I was incompetent until I asked for my Â£20 back; he certainly never gave me notice. I believe he paid his artistes in full at Northwich, but at Colchester he only paid them for the three days they had worked. He said he was sorry he could not pay me, but if I waited till we got to Col<lb/>chester he would gethis cheque and then pay me. I heard some<lb/>thing about his having discounted a promissory note which was dis<lb/>honoured.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250065"/>
               <p>Re-examined. Nothing which I had to do under the agreement and which I actually did affected the failure or success of the tour. The agreement states that there is to be a month's trial and if he is not satisfied a fortnight's notice can begiven on either side. I have never seen this agreement between prisoner and the manager of the Stratford Theatre for thelatter to supply the scenery on the hire system.</p>

                  </hi>, Theatrical Manager, 20, Harrington Street (prisoner, on oath). I used to live at 6, Ledlington Place. At present I am manager of a Variety Agency and have been earning this month from Â£10 to Â£15 a week. I am about to sign a contract to tour a play as general manager at the end of this month. These engagements have been obtained during the hearing of this case. I leased the play, "The Shadow of a Crime "for six months. I have used different names to escape from my wife from whom I was separated and who molested me; she was an inebriate and is now dead. On November 24 I advertised for a young gentleman to learn the duties of management at a small premium. That and a similar advertisement on December 12 are the only advertisements I have ever issued. I had six answers, of which Mills's was one. I wrote him making an appointment, and he called where I was living then in one room at 6, Ledlington Place. I told him I leased the play "The Shadow of a Crime,"and he said he had heard of it, and that he was prepared to pay 15 guineas as the premium, of which he paid me Â£2 as deposit. I gave him references. Nothing was said about scenery; if I leased a play I should naturally lease the scenery. I leased the scenery. Neither Â£5,000 nor any other sum was ever mentioned. I could run a play like this on Â£20 or Â£30. I showed him contracts that I had made with theatre managers at Northwich, Colchester, and Stratford. He left saying he was quite satisfied. He wrote me saying he had a suggestion to make. I have since lost that letter. He called and said as he was a competent manager would I waive the question of premium if he paid me Â£20, to be returnable if he did his</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250066"/>
               <p>duties properly. I drew up this agreement (Exhibit 1), which we both signed. I had no intention of defrauding himwhen I took his Â£20 and if he had proved competent I should have returned it to him. I engaged him to take my place as manager when I could not be there. I gave him money with which to pay the artistes. They all had their money with the exception of a few shillings owing at Stratford. I started the tour on Â£50. I borrowed a sovereign from him to lend one of the artistes, my Â£50 having been eaten up with the expenses. At Northwich the theatre was packed every night, but to my astonish<lb/>ment my share of the takings at the end of the week was only Â£17 10s. I left Mills in charge at the front of the theatre and he allowed the local managers to do me by issuing tickets twice. The very first day we opened I gave him notice when I found what the receipts were. He is an incompetent and an illiterate man and could not do his duties as manager. I paid him Â£2 that week. I was in a position to return his Â£20, but as I had lost money through him I did not see why I should. I can do so now if I want to. I lost money at Colchester, but I paid my artistes for the three days they had worked. I was short of money also because I had discounted a promissory note which was dishonoured. I have never stranded a company in my life. I was the last one to leave Stratford and was able to pay everybody in full except a few shillings. I lost Â£50 on the whole tour through Mills. He asked me for his Â£20 back and I at first arranged to return it to him, but I was afterwards advised not to do so and I did not do so. The reason why I inserted the second advertisement was to get pupils for Mills to teach, but I had to refuse seven or eight offers as I found he was incompetent to do so.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. It is a formal thing to take security for a man's competence; everybody knows that. I offered to payhim back at first because he kept on worrying me. I wrote him saying that I would not return him his money because he had been incompetent previous to my letter offering to repay me. I did not leave Lidling-ton Place without paying my rent. I sent my landlady at Northwich a postal order after I left. The lessee of the theatre at Colchester advanced me the fares to Northwich; that was a matter of form; he deducted it from the takings. Mills understood before he signed the agreement that I only hired the scenery. I had to take a part myself and Mills had to take my place as manager, but he was utterly incom<lb/>petent to do so. The heading on Exhibit 2 properly describes the nature of the company. I arranged what places we should go to and I engaged the artistes; these are very important features in the success of the tour. All the local people at Northwich belonged to one family and the way they did me was that the attendant, after taking a ticket would take it back to the box-office and it would be sold again. It is true I could gauge the returns from the seating capacity of the theatre. I made a row about it at the time. I did not pay Mills his salary because he was not worth it.</p>
               <p>In summing up the Recorder directed the Jury to acquit prisoner on the first count, stating that the money was not paid on safe custody, but as security to be returnable.</p>

                  </hi>, partner, Wadderspoon and Co., printers, 6, Gate Street, Kingsway. There was an amount of Â£1 5s. 5d. owing to my firm by the Society of Apothecaries on March 28. The endorsement on this cheque was not made by our firm or with our authority. I do not know prisoner.</p>
               <p>Inspector <hi rend="smallCaps">HERBERT HINE</hi>, City Police. I was called to Barclay's Bank, Fleet Street. I said to prisoner, "You know me?" He said, "Yes." I then showed him the cheque and said, "How do you account for the possession of this? "He replied, "I saw a man at two o'clock to-day in Greek Street; he said he was Mr. Wodderspoon; he gave me thecheque and told me to take it to Barclay's Bank,</p>

               <p>Fleet Street, and get it cashed and take the money back to him at 75, Greek Street. He did not tell me to take it back at any particular time."I then told him the cheque had been altered and that he would be charged with forging anduttering it. He was then taken to the station. When charged he made no reply. I afterwards asked him if he wished to giveany description of the man that he said he received it from. He said, "I had been drinking with the man in the 'Hercules Pillars.' He is a tall, dark fellow like me; I do not know where he lives. I have known him a few weeks; he looks like an Italian." I went to Greek Street and found the highest number was 60. He was further charged with stealing the letter containing the cheque, and replied, "I never stole no letter at all." He was sober when arrested.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, not on oath). I was coming across Soho Square. At the corner of Greek-Street I saw this gentleman. I have known him about three weeks. I do not know his name. He took me in the "Hercules Pillars "and treated me. He took me into the urinal there and showed me this cheque knowing I was hard up, starving. I went in the bank with it. I could not see nothing wrong with it, the urinal being in the dark. He said he had received it the same as it was. He said he had it off a man in Martin's Lane; he had just been inside buying some horses. He said, "There is nothing wrong with it." He told me he would give me Â£2.

Between March 16 and 18 both prisoners came; Franklin came afterwardsalong and I handed him the keys. I picked out the prisoners at Moor Lane Police Station from a number of others.</p>

                  </persName>, City. On March 21, at 1.10 p.m, I was at the Barbican corner of Bridgewater Street when I saw the two prisoners leaving Kendrew and Co., Franklin carrying some parcels, Hughes carrying a packing case, and a third man carrying parcels. They placed them in a van standing inside the doorway. During the preceding three weeks I had repeatedly seen the three men togther in Beech Street and Bridgewater Street loitering. The van was the one belonging to Newman. There was a fourth man in charge of the van. I went to telephone for assistance at the corner of Golden Lane; when I returned the van was moving off rapidly and I lost sight of it. On March 22 I saw Franklin in a public house at Hoxton, called him out, and said, "I am a police officer and I am going totake you into custody for being concerned with three other men not in custody in breaking and entering a ware-house, 5 and 6, Bridgewater Street, and stealing a quantity of drapery yesterday." On the way to the station he said, "How do you make it three other men?" I said, "There were two besides you carrying the goods out and a fourth man in charge of the horse."He said, "I did not know you counted the driver."When formally charged he said, "All right, I understand."On April 7 I saw Hughes in a public-house in East Road, Hoxton. I called him out and said, "I am a police officer, and I am going to arrest you."He said, "What for? Are you going to put me up for identification for something? "I said, "No, I am going to charge you with being concerned with William Franklin and two other men who are not in custody in break<lb/>ing</p>

               <p>and entering 5 and 6, Bridgewater Street and stealing a quantity of ribbons and other articles on the 21st of last month." He said, "All right. Don't hold me, I will walk with you." He was formally charged at the police station; he made no reply and refused his address. On March 31 I went to 7 and 8, Brooksby Mews, searched the unoccupied stables, and found portion of packing case and various wrappers (produced). The stables had not been recently used for horses and was empty except for the articles produced.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I had nothing to do with arranging for the identification. I have not made a mistake about Hughes. (To Franklin.) I did not ask Franklin what he had done with the van-load of stuff. I did not ask him at the station "What has become of the other three?" I did not say he was a fool to take it on his own shoulders, nor did I offer to give his mother half a sovereign if he would tell who the other three were. I was in the room where the Identification took place, but took no part in it.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. I was called by the prosecution at the police court. I made a statement to Detective Bradshaw. I took New<lb/>man's pony and van to 82, Bridport Place. On the way a tall, dark, clean-shaven fellow, whom I have not seen since, asked, "Have you come from Mr. Newman?" and told me to drive round to Golden Lane. I drove to Bridgewater Street, when a short man, whom I have not seen since, joined us, the two men fetched out some 15 or 20 packages and acase from Kendrew's warehouse. The first man then jumped up and told me to drive to Liverpool Road. We proceeded to the mews in Brooksby Street, where the goods were taken into the stable. He paid me 3s. for the van and 6d. for myself. I never saw Hughes. (To Franklin.) I have never seen Franklin before.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I was told by Newman to go to 82, Bridport Place to do a moving jobâI thought it was to move furniture. I took no notice about that when the man told me to drive to Golden Lane. The van is generally used formoving furniture, frequently of a night time.</p>

I was recom<lb/>mended there by Mr. White, of Whitbread's Brewery, who had known me 18 months. I then worked for H. J. Cable, 68, Bodney Street, fancy box manufacturer. I have an excellent character since I was 14 years old. I was three years with Vokes, "Brewer's Arms," Chatham, after going to the "Mitre Hotel," Chatham, where I was</p>

On March 20, 21, and 22 I was working for Noble, doing gold-blocking; I produce three orders of those dates for the work I did. They are addressed to Twitchings, who is my intended father-in-law; I did the work at his place, 46, Bridport Street, and on his machine. I live at 46, Bridport Street.

               <p>Cross-examined. I know Twitchings as having a very good berth as foreman. The whole of the work in the three orders produced would come to 36s.</p>

                  </hi>, 36, Bridport Place, Hoxton, gold blocker. I have been for 20 years foreman to Whitehead and Co., 7, Bath Build<lb/>ings, fancy box manufacturers. I have a machine, and in the even<lb/>ing have been working on my own account with Hughes under the name of E. Hughes and Co. Hughes is my intended son-in-law. He learned the business from Mr. Gray. I produce printed heading and memorandum form. On March 20, 21, and 23 I received goods from Noble to do 72 gross of gold blocking; the orders are in Noble, jun.'s handwriting, who has put my name instead of E. Hughes and Co. On March 21 the material for the first order arrived before I left at 8.45 a.m. I returned to dinner at 1.10 p.m. and dined with my children and with Hughes. The work was in progress, and I told Hughes to send them in as soon as they were done. When I returned home at 8.30 p.m. the goods had been sent to Noble's. I have known Hughes for five years; he has always borne the character of an honest and hard-working man. The gold blocking consists in stamping card<lb/>board and other material with names, etc., for making fancy boxes.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I carry on business under the name of E. Hughes and Co. because I do not want my firm to know of my doing work on my own account. Bridgewater Street is about 20 minutes' walk from Bridport Place.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled, cross-examined by Franklin. I did not attempt to arrest the four men on March 21 because there were four of themâI went 50 yards to the corner of Golden Lane to tele<lb/>phone for assistance. After arresting Franklin at 9.30, he was not formally charged till 5.30 p.m. In the public-house I told him what he would be charged with. I saw the van leaving and going through Cripplegate Street at too rapid a pace for me to catch up to it.</p>

About the first week in December she let one of the rooms to prisoner, who gave the name of Gillenden, and he stayed there until he was arrested. He did not seem to carry on any business; he used to go out in the day and come back in the evening. I heard him say once or twice that he was going out to look for work, but he did not tell me what sort of work. I used to see him carrying small brown paper parcels</p>

               <p>and sometimes a small handbag. Exhibit 6 is a bag belonging to my husband.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. My husband has never commented to me on the early hours you used to go out to business. I have seen you up as early as seven. I remember last Christmas your asking my husband to give you an introduction to his brother, who is an assistant at Hamerton's Brewery, and he said he would. I con<lb/>sidered you an active man. During the first four months you said you had gout and you could not get about with ease. I noticed papers lying about on the table in your room.</p>

                  </hi>, housekeeper to James Monico, 453, Wandsworth Road, Clapham. There is a stable attached to the house which was to let on February 21. On the 23rd prisoner came and said he wanted it to store cases in. I asked him what kind of cases, and he said, "Hardwares. Some might be soft wares." I charged him 3s. 6d. a week rent. He asked if we had any objection to his having a letter<lb/>box put to the door, so that he could have his letters left there in the mornings and call for them, and I said "No." He gave his name and address as "E. C. Ironside, 61, Bellery Road, Wandsworth Common." He gave two references: A Mr. Fisher and a Mr. W. C. Smith, a fruit broker, 53, Hop Exchange. On March 2 he took pos<lb/>session of the stable and remained there till March 17, paying his rent regularly. This is his rent book (produced). He called every day for his letters and parcels, which I handed himâon some days he got twelve, and he used to get plenty of parcels. He made no use of the stable. On the morning of March 15 two cases of whisky came, of which Exhibit 5 is one. I ordered the carman to put them in the stable. On March 13 a crate came from Huddersfield, which was also put in the stable. He put nothing in the stable in the way of stationery or furniture. On March 6 he nailed this notice on the stable door, "E. C. Ironside, Merchant and Manufacturers' Agent, 453, Wandsworth Road, London, S.W. Please leave all letters and packages at the house."I never heard the name of Gillenden in connection with him. He came on March 11 and looked at the cases that had come for him. He returned later in a taxi, into which he put one of the cases. He took a bottle out of the other case. He left the case there and took the bottle away with him. At seven the next evening he called and took out another bottle, which he put into a handbag and took away. About 1 p.m. the next day, March 17, he brought portmanteau, into which he put five more bottles. This box arrived on March 17, and prisoner took it to the stable, when he called. On March 14 he came for the crate; a man he brought with him took it away. (To prisoner.) It is a stable and coach-house, and the coach-house was large enough tohold several large crates. When you mentioned the Hop Exchange first, Mr. Monico, who was pre<lb/>sent, said that they would be quite enough and he would not trouble to write for it. You did not open the letters I gave you on the 7th; you put them straight into the portmanteau. Some of the</p>

The next day we wrote him saying that we no longer stocked the mantles we had advertised. On March 7 we re<lb/>ceived another postcard with the same heading, asking us to forward other samples and to quote our lowest price to factors. We wrote him on March 8 giving him a list of seven samples we were sending him and quoting trade prices; wesent the parcel of samples at the same time. We do not charge for samples. On March 9 we received a postcard asking us to forward five gross of mantles to go on with, carriage paid. We wrote him next day saying that as it was our first transaction would he let us have the usual trade reference. I believed him to be a wholesale firm wanting to sell again and that he carried on business at 453 Wandsworth Road. (To prisoner.) We received no reply to our last letter. The value of your order was Â£5 19s. We should have given credit for one month and then we would have allowed another 15 days before we pressed for payment.

We sent him a sample potato cutter. We thought he wanted the goods to sell again. We got a postcard dated March 8, which stated that before placing an order he would like us to send samples of two further articles, for which, if satisfactory, he could place good orders with us. We understood that he would be able to do a good trade with our goods and we sent the further samples, for which we sent 15s., the trade terms. The first sample was only a sixpenny line and we did not charge for that. (To prisoner.) I have not known a case where we have not charged agents for samples worth 9s. The account was due on your receiving the goods. To merchants that are well known to us we would give 14 days' credit.

                  </hi>, clerk to William Stenhouse, whisky merchant. Exhibit 13 is a letter from us to prisoner in answer to his postcard. (Prisoner objected to this letter being put in, as it was written from witness's recollection of the postcard he had received 14 days before. It was not put in.) We got a postcard (Exhibit 11), dated March 10, headed in a similar way to Exhibit 25, asking us to forward two dozen bottles of whisky at the trade terms which we had quoted him. On March 14 I sent the goods, value Â£4 8s. with the Excise permit, believing that he was a genuine merchant and able to pay for them. Exhibit 5 is one of our cases, and I have identified five bottles of whisky shown me by the police. At 6.45 p.m. on March 16 I went to 453, Wandsworth Road, which I found to be a stable adjoining a house. The note, "If good for Â£10" on Exhibit 11 is in my writing. (To prisoner.) Your first postcard, which has been mislaid, asked only for quotationsânot samples. We gene<lb/>rally make inquiries before sending goods to strangers, but we did not do so in your case until after they were sent; we have sometimes done so in other cases; it all depends on the value of the order. This was a cash transaction. I put on Exhibit 11 "If good for Â£10," in case we should have further orders from you. I am sure that your first postcard did not state that you wanted the whisky for medicinal purposes. I thought you were a general merchant. I cannot give the name of any firm in the wine and spirit trade who call themselves "manafacturers' agents"; an agent generally gives the firm for which he is an agent. I expected to be paid when I called on March 16. We generally give one month's credit, but that is only when goods are ordered in large quantities. We gave you our best trade terms. We did not say anything in our letter to you about when the account was to be paid.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Mr. Powell, the manager, was away at the time I sent the whisky and I acted upon my own responsibility.</p>

               <p>March 11 we received a postcard headed in a similar manner to Exhibit 25, asking us to send samples. We wrote himenclosing prices of various things, and in reply we got a letter ordering certain steel drills. We sent him the goods with an invoice for Â£1 2s. 11d., understanding that he was trading as a merchant in a small way. We charged trade terms. If we had known that the business was a stable adjoining a private house we should not have sent the goods. We have not been paid. (To prisoner.) If we had known what your premises were like we should have sent you a pro forma invoice, asking for a remittance before sending the goods. If we had learned through our inquiry office that you lived in a house at a rental of Â£60 and rented a stable, I do not think we should have sent the goods even then. We did not knowwhether you could pay for them; as it was a small order, we ran the risk. When the secretary handed me your postcard, he said, "I do not like the look of this, but as the order is so small we will forward the goods." Pay<lb/>ment of your account would be due on April 30.

For the claret we charged him 1s. 5d. We received another postcard on March 17 headed in the same way ordering certain goods. We never sent them. (To prisoner.) I have had ten years' experience of the trade. I thought you were a merchant and wanted the goods to sell again. We thought from your postcard you had a license to sell wines and spirits. You did not describe yourself as an agent for wines, but that is included in "manu<lb/>facturers' agent." We quoted you the same terms as we would to a private customer, because you did not ask for terms. We caused in-quiries to be made about you, but we have not yet received the re<lb/>port. We generally give one month's credit to merchants. Our agents generally pay us once a month. We received a telephonic message cancelling your order.</p>

Shortly after midday I saw prisoner go to the front door carrying a portmanteau, which was apparently empty. He went and came out shortly afterwards carrying this box (Exhibit 1). He went</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250077"/>
               <p>into the stable, where he remained about 15 minutes. He came out carrying the portmanteau, which seemed pretty heavy. We followed him up the Wandsworth Road; he seemed very suspicious. I walked up to him and said, "I am a police officer. What have you got in that bag?" He said, "Five bottles of whisky." I said, "Where did you get them from?" and he said, "My stable at 453 Wands<lb/>worth Road." I said, "I am not satisfied. I believe these have been obtained by a long firm fraud and I shall arrest you for the unlawful possession of them." He said, "All right; I will not give any trouble."At the station I asked him his name. He said, "E. C. Ironsides." I said, "What does 'E. C.' stand for?" and he said, "Edward Charles."He refused to give his address. Later he said, "My name is not 'E. C. Ironsides'; it is 'Edward Charles Gregory,'âyou know that well enoughâbut I refuse to give my address."He said he was a merchant and manufacturers' agent. I said he would be charged with the unlawful possession of whisky and the box. He said he did not know what it contained. I subsequently went to the stable and took possession of Exhibit 1, which was addressed to "E. C. Ironsides," and contained four inverted gas brackets and fittings. In his possession were found two letters addressed to "Mr. Gillenden, 50, Dagnan Road, Balham." In a rent-book found on him we found the address "61, Bellery Road, Wandsworth Common," but it was ascertained that there was no such road. He had 1s. 6d. on him and Exhibits 3, 4, arid 12 (produced). I went to 55, Dagnan Road, where I found the letters which have been produced. Neither there nor at the stable did I find any books recording business transactions what<lb/>ever. I found about 100 postcards similar to Exhibit 25. I also, found a number of letters in regard to goods supplied or to be supplied by differentfirms. I showed prisoner an empty bottle of Stenhouses' whisky which I had found in the front room at Dagnan Road and he said, "Yes, I drank that one myself; that was one of the twelve; the other one has gone." On March 25 he was further charged with obtaining goods by false pretences and he made no reply. (To prisoner.) There was a table in your room at Dagnan Road, but it was a small one. There were letters and catalogues on it, but they were not arranged in order. Amongst the letters we found a letter to you from R. Kitchen, hardware merchant, of Sheffield, dated March 9, enclosing price lists and stating that on receipt of cash he would send the goods you had ordered and stating that he had not yet a London agent. There was also a letter to you from Ermin Brothers with reference to the remarks made by the steward of a club to whom you were supplying whisky as to the prices their firm charged.</p>

               <p>that I was a wine merchant. It was my intention to procure certain orders from private customers and to forward those orders to the firms. They could then supply the goods direct and pay me a commission. I only had the stable under three weeks and I had not time to fit it up. The letter from Ermin Brothers shows that I intended them to supply the steward of the club direct; I was to receive a commission. I have had very little time to prepare my defence.</p>

                  <hi rend="largeCaps">MAY</hi>, Henry Gomer (45, actor)</persName>, pleaded guilty on January 13 (see preceding vol., p. 238) of maliciously publishing a defamatory libel of and concerning Samuel Henry Henderson and maliciously publishing a defamatory libel of and concerning Evelyn Maude Hen<lb/>derson, and was released on his own recognisances.</p>
            <p>On April 28, Mr. Walter Stewart applied for a warrant for the prisoner's arrest on the ground that he had broken his recognisances. The warrant was issued and executed, and prisoner was now brought up for judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="smallCaps">ARTHUR WILLIAM WATERLOW KING</hi>. I was Chairman of the Acting Bench of Magistrates who committed prisoner for trial. Since he was released at this Court on his own recognisances he has written me two letters, which were handed to the Director of Public Prosecu<lb/>tions.</p>
            <p>Cross-examined by prisoner. On your non-appearance in answer to the summons, the hearing was adjourned once and then a warrant was granted. I think a letter was handed in asking for a further adjournment, but the application wasopposed and the warrant was granted.</p>

               <hi rend="smallCaps">GEORGE BELLAMY</hi>, actor, 2, Evershott Gardens, N.W. I know pri<lb/>soner and know his handwriting. This letter headed "A Fool There Was" is in his handwriting. It is addressed to me. It is in dog<lb/>gerel verse and contains scurrilous abuse of myself, Mrs. Henderson, and Mr. Henderson. (It was read.) I received it after he was tried here in January. It was I who got him the engagement with Mrs. Henderson. To my knowledge she has paid him every penny she arranged to pay.</p>
            <p>Prisoner expressed his contrition for what he had done and stated that he had understood he was bound over not to continue writing letters to Mr. and Mrs. Henderson, and this he had not done. He stated that he had lost his temper owing to the fact that he had not been able to get money from Mrs. Henderson, to which he thought he had a right under a contract by which she employed him in a sketch. He promised not to continue his conduct.</p>
            <p>Judge Lumley Smith, stating that the libels prisoner had written since his trial satisfied him that he ought to be called up for judgment in respect of the previous libels, sentenced him for these previous libels to Two weeks' imprisonment without hard labour, to date from the first date of these Sessions.</p>

                  </hi>, 440, New Cross Road, theatre manager. In January I inserted an advertisement in "The Stage," being then resi<lb/>dent at 180, Clive Street, Cardiff, and received reply from prisoner: "Electrical Theatre, Wyvern Hall, High Road, South Tottenham, February 1, 1911. Re your advertisement. I am in want of a general assistant manager for above and lady money-taker, to commence on Monday, February 13. A 12 months' agreement will be given." Signed, "Alfred Moody, General Manager East London Cinema. Company, Limitedâ40 theatres now open." I replied and received letter from prisoner agreeing to engage me as assistant manager and the lady as money-taker at a joint salary of Â£2 5s., requiring cash security for Â£15, stating that the lady would have charge of takings if from Â£60 to Â£100 a week, and asking me to wire deposit of Â£2 as he (prisoner) had several applications; also that his company, had now 20 theatres open and a 14 years' lease of Wyvern Hall. I imme<lb/>diately wired Â£2, forwarded Â£13, and received a letter engaging me and the lady to commence on February 13 and undertaking that the Â£15 would be returned at the end of the first month; also offering to get me apartments in London. On February 6 prisoner wrote that the date of opening, was changed to February 20, but that I should be paid half salary for week commencing February 13. On February 11 prisoner wrote that there was delay with the Middlesex County Council over the license and that the hall could not be opened for three weeks, but that I could be transferred to another hall, and requesting me to come to 440, New Cross Road, where prisoner had engaged rooms for me. I went there; prisoner called and told me that he had found an engagement for me at the Greenwich Theatre, that he had paid further security and required another Â£5, which I gave him, he to return it at the commencement of my engagement at Wyvern Hall. I paid him the Â£5, believing that he had an engagement for me as manager and for the lady with me, Miss Syke, a cash-taker at Greenwich. He arranged to meet me on the Monday and introduce me to the staff.</p>

               <p>On February 20 he wrote putting me off; I then went to Greenwich Theatre and Jearned that the prisoner had nothing to do with it. The next day prisoner called and told me that he referred to the theatr e in Stockwell Street, Greenwich. He took me there and appointed to meet me the next day and give me the keys of the theatre and the bills, so that we should open on the Wednesday evening. I never saw prisoner afterwards. I received a number of letters from himexcus<lb/>ing delay, etc., one dated February 24 stating that he had an engage<lb/>ment at the Hippodrome, Cambridge. I went to the police on Feb<lb/>ruary 23.</p>

I knew the hall was mort<lb/>gaged and that it had been advertised, "Apply to the caretaker." Prisoner told me that his company had deposited Â£140 with the soli<lb/>citors, Smith and Mason. Mr. Kearton regularly came to the hall. I told him about the prisoner; he said he knew nothing about him and that it was not likely he should let the hall for Â£140 a year. I told prisoner of this, but he deceived me. He said the hall was out of the hands of the landlord, that his company was very wealthy, and they had taken the hall from the mortgagees. Prisoner interviewed a carpenter to make alterations and some one from the Electrical Sup<lb/>ply Company; he was there nine days in all.</p>

                  </persName>, R Division. On February 25, at 4.30 p.m., I saw prisoner in the waiting-room at Bow Railway Station. I told him I was a police officer and should arrest him on a warrant for obtaining Â£5 from Ernest Carter by false pretences. Prisoner said, "He is a fool to do this. I should have paid him Â£5 to-night. I cannot see how he could do this." At Blackheath Road Police Station I read the warrant to him. He said, "It is false." When charged he said, "It's all false." I searched him and found on him Â£1 2s. 4d. and a number of letters.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). In December last I met a Mr. Collins and a Mr. Crawford, who informed me they were forming a company called the London Cinema Company, to run theatres in London and the provinces. I was to be district manager and engage the staff and no one was to have a responsible position without secu<lb/>rity. Crawford said the first hall they would open would be Wyvern Hall, South Tottenham. I at once went there, informed the care<lb/>taker who I was and asked if his employers had told him that the hall was let to my company, meaning, of course, Crawford and Collinsâthe London Cinema Company. He said he thought he had see Mr. Collins and Mr. Crawford. I then saw the hall; the Caretaker said he would see the owner that evening; I told him to give the particulars to the owner and that my company had taken the hall; that I would call again in a day or two. On the next occasion I saw the hall-keeper I asked him if he had seen the owner; he told me he had and I was to get on with the business of getting ready for the opening. A</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250083"/>
               <p>few days after I saw Crawford at the Trocadero. He told me there was some difficulty with the Middlesex County Council over the license and would I see what I could do about it. So I wrote to the Middle<lb/>sex County Council and received a reply, which I gave to Crawford. I saw a gentleman from the County Council, who told me what altera<lb/>tions were required. I told Crawford it would be impossible to make those alterations in time to open in three weeks and that something would have to be done to get a place to start in. Crawford told me he had the offer of the Palace, at Greenwich, which could be opened at once, and I could transfer the staff there. I suggested we might get the Hippodrome, at Cambridge, communicated with the proprie<lb/>tor and received a wire that we could have the hall and open on February 18. The same evening I called upon the witness Carter, told him what had occurred and agreed to return his money when he commenced his engagement, he to have half salary until then. He said he would rather be at a music-hall. The next day I saw Carter again. He asked for money; I paid 8s. his rent and gave him a few shillings. I took him to Stockwell Street, Greenwich, showed him the hall, told him I was in hopes of getting that, but if not, he could go to Cambridge on Monday, February 27. I communicated with him every day by letters, wire, and telephone, and on the day of my arrest I was arranging to see him at his apartments and he was to telephone me at 4.30 at Bow Station. Instead of that I was arrested at Bow Station, so I could do nothing further. I have communicated with Crawford and all the people connected with this and have had the letters returned, and none of the witnesses have come up to speak for me. Mr. Walter Harris, of 21, Great Eastern Street, called at the hall on my instructions and measured for the seats. He promised to be here, but he has not come. There were several letters left at Wyvern Hall which I have asked for, but they have not been found.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have known Crawford a good many years; his Christian name is Charles Henry; he is professionally known as Law<lb/>rence Crawford. I have known Collins five or six years. I do not know his Christian name, he is professionally known as Lawrence Collins. I do not know where either of them are nowâthey have greatly deceived me. Crawford had all the money I received excepting 25 per cent, which I had as commission. I had arranged that I should have 25 per cent, on all money that I introduced or received. I sup<lb/>pose I had Â£2 out of Aulburn's Â£10, of which I paid him back 30s. in wages. I got no salary from Crawford; I received a commission of 25 per cent, on money deposited by way of security. The agreement signed "Lawrence Crawford" is in my writing. I was authorised to sign Crawford's name. In writing that we (the company) had a 14 years' lease of Wyvern Hall I must have thought so at the time, because Crawford had told me.</p>

               <p>missus was in; he said, "She has gone out." This man I afterwards identified as Gardstein. On leaving Exchange Buildings I passed through Cutler Street. I saw a man there looking down Exchange Buildings; I believe it was Dubof, but I am not definitely sure. On my reporting the matter at the station a number of officers were col<lb/>lected and the place was surrounded. I was stationed in front of Harris's shop. Bentley and other officers went round to Exchange Buildings. Almost immediately I heard several shots. I ran into Cutler Street and saw Police-constables Strongman and Smoothy assisting Sergeant Tucker, who was lying wounded on the ground. I went for the ambulance.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Melville. Cutler Street was very well lighted. I said at the station the same night that I could not identify the man I saw, and I failed to positively identify Dubof when he was placed in a row with others.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bryan. When I knocked at 11, Exchange Buildings I saw nobody but Gardstein.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grantham here stated that he had read the depositions and listened to Mr. Bodkin's opening, and had formed the view that there was no evidence that Dubof or Peters actually took part in the shooting of the policemen, and that it was undesirable to proceed with the first count of the indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodkin, after this expression of his Lordship's opinion, with<lb/>drew the charge of wilful murder (a verdict of Not guilty being entered), and the trial proceeded on the second count.</p>

Bentley knocked at the door, and it was opened by a man; Exhibit 3 is a photograph of that man (Gardstein). Bentley exchanged a few observations with the man, who then went inside, leaving the door a little open. After a short interval Bentley pushed the door open and slipped into the passage. I was standing in the carriage way, facing the street door. I saw the door at the back open, and through it a man's arm holding a revolver; I saw and heard a shot from this revolver and simultaneously another revolver was fired from the stairs. Bentley and Sergeant Bryant were shot and fell; the latter knocked me over as he fell. Then I saw a hand come out of the doorway, firing a number of shots in the direction of the other officers. When I got up I found Bryant holding his hand, wounded; Bentley was lying in the doorway; Woodhams, Choate, and Tucker were also lying in the street. I was lying in the gutter for only a few seconds. There must have been 20 or 30 shots fired.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. It would be just after midnight when I finally left Exchange Buildings; the shooting occupied perhaps 15 or 16 seconds.</p>

After Bentley and Woodhams had been shot down, a man came out of the doorway and fired in the direction of Tucker and myself; Tucker being hit I supported him round towards Cutler Street; looking over my shoulder I saw the man following us up, still firing rapidly. Afterwards I saw at 59, Grove Street, the dead body of Gardstein; this was the man I saw firing at Exchange Buildings.

                  </hi>, 271, Brunswick Buildings, Goulston Street, E. I am manager of Salmon and Gluckstein's branch at Walthamstow. On December 16 I left there by a train arriving at Liverpool Street at 11.29 p.m. Walking homewards, when I got out of Devonshire Square into Borers Passage I heard the sound of firearms. I at first thought that somebody who had been at a rifle range, which is there, was firing in the air. As I went up the passage three men were coming towards me; they seemed all huddled together and rather excited; the one in the centre was held up by the arms by the other two, and I thought he was drunk; a woman was running up behind them. As they came up towards me the two outside men stopped and held revolvers in my face; one said, "Don't follow us"; the other said, "Don't follow"; the woman was then about two yards behind them. I stopped, and the four passed me, running through Arrow Alley. I noticed the woman's face, and also that she had a kind of a fur and a muff; the night being very windy, the flap of the muff blew up towards her face; she was about 5 ft. 5 in. or 5 ft. 6 in. I walked through Cutler Street to get into Houndsditch. At the opening of Exchange Buildings I saw four policemen lying on the ground. I ran to Bishopsgate Police Station and reported what I had seen. On the 18th I saw at the mortuary the dead body of a man; Exhibit 3 is photograph of him; I identify him as the centre of the three men I saw on the 16th. On December 23 I went to the police station and from a row of 15 or 20 men picked out Dubof and Peters as the two other men I had seen. On February 8 I picked out from about 15 women Vassileva as the woman I saw with the three men.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. When I heard the shots I hesitated for a moment and then walked on. I did not say at the police court, "I heard shots in the direction of Exchange Buildings and I rushed in that direction: as I was rushing the three men faced me." As a fact I ran down the steps in the direction of the rifle range, and then hesitated and walked along in my ordinary way. When the men pointed revolvers at me I was not frightened; I thought they were showing me how they had been firing in the air; I thought they were students out for a lark. I said at the police court that I was upset and ran away; I was not upset, nothing out of the ordinary; I did not run away;</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250094"/>
               <p>I walked in a fairly cool manner. I thought at the time it was best for me to get away as the police might arrest me if I was found close to the men; I did not then know of the shooting at the policemen; I mean I thought I might be arrested as one of the party for dis<lb/>charging firearms in the open street. When I got to the police station I did not tell the inspector that I had seen two men with revolvers; the reason was that my wife had just been confined and I thought that if I started opening my mouth I might be detained for some time; which would have upset my wife. It is not the fact that I was so excited and terrified that I did not know what I was doing. The men were in my view between two and three minutes; they were walking rather sharply. When I got to the police station I did not make a statement; I just told them to send on an ambulance and men as soon as possible. The next day I made a statement. I then said that I could not give a description of the men, except as to their height. I do not think I said they were Russians; I said they spoke broken English. On the occasion of my identifying Dubof and Peters I knew that the men who pointed revolvers at me were foreigners; I picked out the accused from a row of about 15 men, five of whom in all were foreigners; I cannot remember whether the other three foreigners were young or old or were wearing hats. I gave a description of the men to a constable on December 18; it was taken down in writing. (The statement was called for; Mr. Bodkin said the Treasury had never had the statement; he believed the witness was inaccurate.) I gave their height, and said that one had a short moustache and was rather fair. I am sure I made this statement on the 18th, after identifying the dead body of Gardstein. (Mr. Bodkin repeated that there was no statement by the witness; there was only a report made by a detective of what witness had said to him on that day; no statement was signed by witness until the 23rd. Mr. Melville called for the detective's report; Mr. Bodkin declined to produce it.) I had never seen either of the three prisoners before this occurrence. I cannot be certain how the men were dressed; I think one wore an overcoat. I saw them for two or three minutes; they deliberately stopped and stared me in the face and pointed the revolvers at me.</p>
               <p>(Tuesday, May 2.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grantham said that after the cross-examination of the witness Levy he thought it right to say that, having gone very carefully through the evidenceâand the prosecution had no other evidence of the identification of Dubof and Peters as the two men who were carry<lb/>ing Gardstein that nightâthe evidence to his mind was so unsatisfactory that he could not allow any jury to find the prisoners guilty on such evidence of identification. Therefore his suggestion to counsel for the Crown was that, with regard to the charge against Dubof and Peters of being accessories after the fact to the murder, there was not sufficient evidence to justify the Crown in pressing the case. As to the woman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250095"/>
               <p>the position was somewhat different. He thought there was other evi<lb/>dence which to some extent would confirm Levy that she was the woman who was walking behind the men who were carrying Gard<lb/>stein. There were other facts showing that she was a great friend of Gardstein's, and in these circumstances there might be reasons why she should follow the wounded man and yet have had no part in the murder. Therefore, it would not be wise for the Crown to press the charge against her of being an accessory after the fact to the murder. There was another difficulty which had arisen which he did not think the Crown were able to meet, and that wasâassuming that these two men and Vassileva were the three people who were carrying Gard<lb/>stein, were the Crown in a position to show that they knew that the murder had been committed? The law was that it must be shown that the persons charged with being accessories after the fact knew at the time that the murder had been committedâmere wounding would not do. It seemed to him that the Crown would not be safe in going on against the prisoners on that charge.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodkin said that the learned Alderman, after a very full investigation, having committed upon all the charges, it was con<lb/>sidered right that they should all be submitted to the judgment of the court. It would not have been right or fair to the prisoners to select for trial a misdemeanour charge while there were on the file such serious charges of felony. Therefore he had opened to the jury the whole of the facts; but from those representing the Crown there would be no word in any way antagonistic to what his Lordship had just said. He did not gather that any suggestion was made against the good faith, honesty, or respectability of Levy. He was a witness who was entirely unconnected with any phase of this caseâa mere citizen in the street happening to be there at the particular timeâbut it was, of course, possible that he might not be accurate in the evidence which in his heart he believed. In these circumstances he very respectfully acquiesced in the view Mr. Justice Grantham had taken, and would proceed with the misdemeanour charge of conspiracy to break and enter the premises of Mr. Harris.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">MELVILLE</hi> said that on behalf of Dubof and Peters it was only fair to say that before they were arrested, and as soon as the police came to them to make inquiries, they gave the police every information and assistance in their power, and told the police everything they were able to tell them. On the prisoners' behalf evidence was called at the police court, and was available at this court, to show that at the time Levy said they were at the end of Exchange Buildings they were at their own homes.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grantham added that, although they had come to a somewhat sudden conclusion as to these two charges which were for<lb/>mulated by the Crown, and as to which the prisoners were committed for trial by the Alderman, he thought that no case had ever been brought before him that was so difficult to manipulate and manage by the presiding Alderman in the court before which this case was brought and the evidence given, and that there was no other course</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250096"/>
               <p>open to the Alderman than that which he took. He thought that the case reflected very great credit on the Alderman for the way in which he investigated it and on the police in the efforts they made to trace the various persons implicated in this tragedy and also in the Sidney Street tragedy which followed it. He said this lest it might be thought by those who did not understand the drift of his observations that it meant any reflection on the way the case was got up or managed or on the Alderman who committed the case for trial. It was quite right that the prisoners should be committed for trial in order to have the charges properly investigated in this court.</p>
               <p>A verdict of Not guilty was returned as to Dubof, Peters, and Vas-sileva on the second count of the first indictment. Rosen was then brought up, and the trial proceeded on the second indictment.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grantham. There is a statement I wish to make for the benefit of the jury. Having gone very carefully through the whole of the evidence in this case, I am strongly of opinion that the three men who were really the chief murderersâat any rate, the men who, we know were shootingâhave each of them met his doom. That is my view; I may be wrong. One of themâGardsteinâwas clearly one of the men shooting at the policemen. In my view the other two men who were in the house were the two men who were burned in Sidney Street. There is no evidence to show that the man who was called "Peter the Painter" was one of the murderers. I may be wrong, but that is my view. It is rather satisfactory to know that at any rate the three chief men engaged in it have met their doom, though perhaps not in the way some of us would have liked. There is strong evidence that these were the three men who were guilty of the murders, although there were others with them.</p>

                  </hi>, house surgeon, St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In the early morning of December 17 I saw Sergeant Bentley. He died from the two bullet wounds, one in the front of the right shoulder joint and the other on the right side of the neck. I extracted these bullets (Exhibits 122 and 123). Exhibit 122 was found in the back near the spine; it had gone through the body. Exhibit 123 was just under the skin behind the neck. Their direction was from right to left, not down; the man must have been firing from straight opposite.</p>

                  </hi>. In December last I was assisting Dr. Bernstein, 53, Commercial Road. At 3.30 a.m., on December 17 two women, whom I now know to be Trasajonsky and Milstein, came. I</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250098"/>
               <p>accompanied them to 59, Grove Street, where lying on a bed in the front room on the first floor I saw Gardstein. I found a bullet lodging in the front of his chest; the entrance wound was at the back. I did what I could for him and went away. I returned at about 11 a.m., when I found him dead. On the next day I made a post-mortem examination. On the first finger of his right hand there was an abrasion, which might have been caused by shooting with a revolver. I extracted this bullet (Exhibit 75.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. One of the women had a hat and the other a shawl. I cannot remember what the hat was like. They were both middle height and one of them was of a somewhat slim build. I cannot say the colour of their eyes. I do not think either of them was wearing a dark blue three-quarter jacket. One of them had a pleasant face; I was an hour with her altogether. I subsequently identified Trassjonsky. (To the jury.) I should think a man wounded as this man was would be able to hold up his head for about half a minute after he was wounded.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When I subsequently saw Milstein I thought she might be the other woman who accompanied Trassjonsky. These are photographs of them. (Exhibits 142 and 143.)</p>

                  </hi>. In November and December last I was manager to Messrs. Millard, of Houndsditch. Nos. 9, 10, and 11, Exchange Buildings belonged to them and I looked after them. From November 21 to the beginning of December a man named Silsteanu was the occu<lb/>pier of No. 10. I have not the rent book with me. About the third week in November No. 9 was vacant. A man giving the name of Levi came about it; he was dark, clean shaven, had thick lips, a slight turned-up nose, and his face was slightly pimpled. I took him to be a Russian. He was given over to Norris to be shown over the premises. He agreed to take them at a rental of 10s. a week; he paid on November 21. Just about that time No. 11 became vacant and it was offered to Levi. Norris showed him over and he became the tenant on November 30. On December 12 he came and paid a second amount for rent. I never saw him again after that. On December 5 a man of about 5 ft. 10 in. and fair, wearing a trilby hat and a dark overcoat came about No. 9, which was then vacant. I should take him to be a Russian. Norris showed him over. He agreed to take it at 12s. a week and paid a deposit of 5s. On December 12 a man named Goldstein paid the rent; he was a short, dark man with a dark moustache. Exhibit 3 is a photo of the man (Gardstein). He was not the man who had taken the pre<lb/>mises; he said he called on behalf of his friend. I never went to Nos. 9 and 11 from November 20 to December 16.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. Norris might possibly have been longer with the man who called on December 5 than I was. If Norris says that he was dark and about 5 ft. 6 in. in height with a sallow complexion I should say he was wrong.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. The man who took No. 11 wanted it papered and the man who took No. 9 made no such requirement. No. 9 was in a better condition than No. 11.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employ of Millard Brothers. Last November I was sent to show somebody over No. 9,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250099"/>
               <p>Exchange Buildings. He was a foreigner. Later on I showed him over No. 11, which he took. Subsequently I showed a man over No. 9. He did not take it. I took him to No. 10 and showed him over that. I am not well to-day. It was the second man who took No. 9. After the time I showed him over there was no furniture there; the shutters were always up. On December 13 a man and boy brought a box, which they took in there; they opened the door with a key. After No. 11 was taken I saw a woman there. I should recognise her if I saw her. I do not see her here.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. The man whom Mr. Benning asked me to show over No. 9 at the end of November was dark and he had a sallow com<lb/>plexion.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I never had an opportunity to see what furniture was put into No. 11. I never saw a woman go into No. 9. (To the Court.) The man who took No. 11 was named Levi; he was clean shaven; had a sallow complexion with pimples. I never saw the tenant of No. 9 in the place at all.</p>

                  </hi>, engineer, 112, High Street, Islington. I have a workshop at 15, Duncan Terrace, where 1 keep various kinds of tools and a furnace. This photograph (Exhibit 3) is of a man who worked there. I did not know his name; I know now that he was Gardstein; I called him "The Russian," as he came from Russia. I first saw him about fifteen months ago; I met him in a club in Jubilee Street; it was a working men's clubâan Anarchist club. He asked me if I could give him the use of my tools because he had an invention to develop. He used to turn and file pieces of metal, but I did not see him often as I was not working in the workshop much then. I did not pay him anything nor he me. He could only speak a few words of English or French, so we talked very little. I used to leave the key with my landlord to give him. Some time before December 16 I had the idea of brazing metals by means of oxygen. I may have had a few words with Gardstein about it. For the purpose of my experi<lb/>ments I bought a cylinder of oxygen, a pressure gauge, a spanner, an adaptor, and a pair of goggles from Messrs. Broadhurst. I bought at first a 6 ft. cylinder and afterwards a 40 ft. cylinder. On Decem<lb/>ber 14 a man came and asked me where he could buy a cylinder of oxygen as he had a dynamite shock to make. I agreed to sell him all the things I had bought for Â£5. I wrote to Broadhurst's, asking them to fetch the 40 ft. cylinder and fill it with oxygen, which they did. This man paid me Â£1 and the man who fetched (about 4 p.m. on December 16) the things paid me the balance, Â£4. I think Gardstein was there on the morning of that day. I have since identified the things that I sold.</p>

He did not know exactly what he wanted. I eventually sold him these two sheets of asbestos (Exhibits 5a and 5b),</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250100"/>
               <p>for which he paid me 9s. 6d. On December 23 I was at Bishopsgate Police Station where I saw some men, amongst whom I saw Peters; he reminded me very much of the man who came in.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. It was about 12.45 p.m. when he called. I described him as "a Russian; about 5 ft. 6 in. or a little over; sallow; somewhat dark; sandy coloured moustache; about 26; high cheek bones; pimples on the face." I will not swear positively it was Peters.</p>

               <p>Superintendent <hi rend="smallCaps">JOHN OTTAWAY</hi>, Detective Department, City Police-About midnight on December 16, having heard of these occurrences, I went to Exchange Buildings; the wounded officers had been removed, but the place was surrounded with police. I went into No. 11; in the ground floor room the gas was alight, a fire was burn<lb/>ing brightly, and on the table were some eatables, as if some persons had been eating there; there were an armchair and three ordinary chairs and a couch in that room. In the first-floor room there were a bed with bedding, a table and a chair; the second-floor room was quite empty. In a cupboard under the stairs I found the two bottles (Exhibits 104a and 104b). I went into No. 10; the house was quite empty; in the yard was a kind of stall board, like the top of a coster's barrow. The separating wall between 9, 10, and 11 was about seven feet high; on the top of the wall there were signs of persons having clambered over from 11 to 10, and from 10 to 9; the stall board would assist in that purpose. I went into No. 9; there was no furniture in it. On the street door there were two locks, one new and</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250101"/>
               <p>one old. In the front room was a coil of 63 feet of india rubber piping (Exhibit 4); this tubing was just sufficient to go from the gas bracket in the room at No. 9 to the safe in Harris's back room. I also found four sheets of asbestos fibrous plaster (Exhibits 5a and 5b); two boxes (6 and 8); a carpenter's bit (7); a bag of sand, and some mortar recently mixed; a 40-feet gas cylinder (10). In the closet at the back of No. 9 there was on the seat some brown paper spread on which was a quantity of brick rubbish and some tools, drills, crowbars, etc. Against the seat of the closet there was a large opening in the brick<lb/>work of the dividing wall between the yard and the back of Harris's shop. I found later that the new lock on the door of No. 9 (Ex<lb/>hibit 39) could be opened from the outside; Exhibit 38, the key of that lock, was found on the body of Gardstein. I afterwards went to 59, Grove Street; there were there some chairs similar to those found at 11, Exchange Buildings.</p>
               <p>To Mr. <hi rend="smallCaps">MELVILLE</hi>. None of the exhibits I have mentioned were found on the persons or in the homes of Peters or Dubof. They are indicted together with Gardstein, Fritz, Josef, Hotf<lb/>man, Levi, and others. Gardstein was found shot at 59, Grove Street; Fritz lived at that place with Millstein; Peter the Painter had a room there. The bodies of Fritz and Josef were found burnt at 100, Sidney Street, on January 3. Since December 16, Peter the Painter has never been seen. 36, Lindley Street was the lodging of Hoffman. I know that Marx went to 59, Grove Street on the night of Decem<lb/>ber 16; he has not been found; we think he is abroad; we never dis<lb/>covered where he had been living. No firearms or ammunition of any sort have been found in the possession of Dubof or Peters. About the 19th or 20th of December an official description was circulated of Dubof. We found him at his lodgings on the 22nd. Marx was a Russian. The photograph produced (Exhibit 144) has been identified as of him. Dubof was traced to 22, Galloway Road, Shepherd's Bush, by his name and address being found at 59, Grove Street, also by a picture found there signed "Zurka," dated" 15th December, 1910." (Exhibit 55.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I understand that Josef used to visit 11, Ex<lb/>change Buildings. The furniture in the rooms at 11, Exchange Buildings was such as is characteristic of any poor tenement. In order for anybody to obtain access by the back from No. 9, to 11, Exchange Buildings, or vice versa, it would be necessary for him or her to climb first of all over the seven-feet retaining wall; in the yard of No. 9 there is also a cistern, but there is sufficient room for a person to pass between the wall and the cistern. When I gave eidence before the Coroner on February 3, I said that no finger prints of any value to the police had been found. The bottles produced to-day had then been found, but the marks had not then been identified as finger prints. We have made the fullest inquiries as to Vassileva; she has never been in trouble in England before. She came to England about four years ago, then being about 19 years old. I know that about that time there was a large incursion to this country of Russian Jews; I do not know anything about political or racial</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250102"/>
               <p>persecutions in Russia; no doubt the immigrants are of the respectable class as well as otherwise. Vassileva earned her living for some time as a cigarette maker in a tobacconist's establishment in Commercial Road, and other establishments. I do not know that she is the daughter of a chef who earns his livelihood in the Palace at St. Petersburg. I do not know what wages she earned; I suppose she was just a poor girl without superfluous goods. I was not aware that she had been the mistress of a man.</p>

I have had 10 years experience in finger-print work, and have had hundreds of thousands of finger-print impressions; I have never met a case in which the finger impressions of two different persons have corresponded. On December 17 I received the two bottles (Exhibits 104a and 104b) and took photographs of finger-print marks upon them. On February 15 I took finger impressions of Vas<lb/>sileva. I produce enlarged portraits of these, which enables me to say that the marks on the bottles correspond with the impressions of Vassileva's finger prints.</p>

One man was named Fritz, the other gave no name; Fritz occupied the back room, the other man the front. I gave to Fritz a door key (Exhibit 113). A woman called Luba Millstein lived with Fritz in the back room. They continued to live there till December 16, after which I did not see the two men again. I did not know anything of what had happened at my house until the police came the next morning. I was then shown a man's dead body. I had seen that man once or twice before going up stairs to see my lodgers. Dubof and Rosen also visited there. Dubof, I think, came to see Fritz; it was a long time before December 16 that he came. I saw Rosen there about a fortnight before December 16. A woman called Trassjonsky used also to come.</p>

                  </persName>. Trassjonsky was detained by the police on December 17; Millstein on the 18th. On the morning of the 17th I went to 59, Grove Street, and found the dead body of Gardstein. Sergeant Richardson examined the man's clothing; on it were found 30 cartridges (Exhibit 37), a key of the new lock to 9, Exchange Buildings (Exhibit 38), and a drill; there was an overcoat on the bed with a bullet hole through it; in one of the pockets were seven cartridges in a carrier; under the pillow was a Dreise pistol; two left-hand gloves, a pair of gas pliers, a door key of 59, Grove Street. We also found another magazine with six cartridges in it,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250103"/>
               <p>another with seven cartridges unexploded. On the table was a cloth cap and in it 13 loose cartridges and some rifle bullets, a card-board box with 50 cartridges for a Mauser pistol, a cartridge belt, a dagger, a violin, a tambourine, a mandoline, a water-colour drawing signed "Zurka 15/12/10" (Exhibit 55), a piece of paper (Exhibit 56) con<lb/>taining the name of "Y. Dubof, 20, Galloway Road, Shepherd's Bush." In the front room were two upholstered chairs, en suite with those found at 11, Exchange Buildings. In the back room I found Trass<lb/>jonsky burning papers at the grate, including some photographs, one of Luba Millstein. I afterwards went to Trassjonsky's room at 10, Settle Street, and there found a pawnbroker's contract (Exhibit 120). On December 22 I saw Dubof write something (Exhibit 121); the writing on Exhibit 120 is the same as that on Exhibit 121. The watch is pawned in the name of Charles Somerfold, 40, Gould Street. At 59, Grove Street, I found in the front room a greenish bag (Exhibit 94).</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. The violin, tambourine, and mandoline I found in the front room; that was the room occupied by Peter the Painter; in the same room I found the picture (Exhibit 55) and Exhibit 56. I got to 59, Grove Street, just after 1 p.m. on the 17th; the burglarious exhibits were all found in the front room; the room seemed in a state of disturbance, with things scattered about. When I asked Dubof for a specimen of his writing he made no objection to writing Exhibit 121. I have not before been called to give evidence as to similarity of hand<lb/>writing; I was asked to make the comparison here because Exhibit 121 was written by Dubof in my presence. I have had no opportunity of seeing the writing of Peter the Painter, or Fritz, or Marx, or Gardstein.</p>

                  </hi>, of Ely Brothers, Edmonton. I have had con<lb/>siderable experience in examining different kinds of pistols. Exhibits 63 and 66 are Mauser auto-pistols of 301 calibre; they are of German make. The barrels are rifled with four lands. These bullets, Exhibit 31, 32, 84, 86, 126, 127, and 131 have been fired from them. Ex<lb/>hibit 115 is a Browning automatic Belgian pistol rifled with five lands, the calibre being 7.65 millmetres. Exhibit 75 has been fired from it. Exhibits 122, 123, 124, 125, 129, and 130 are bullets which could have been fired from Exhibit 2 which is a Dreise magazine pistol rifled with four lands. This box (Exhibit 50) contains cartridges which are suitable for Exhibit 63 and 66. Exhibit 77 is another Browning automatic Belgian pistol rifled with six lands. I have seen no bullets that could be fired from such a pistol. The bullets carry over 1,000 yards. Brownings and Dreises are dangerous up to about 550 fyards.</p>

                  </hi>, 8, Hopwood Street, Shepherd's Bush. Last year I was in the employ of a rubber company in Chis-wick. One day last October I was looking in a shop in Uxbridge Road when Dubof came out and knocked into me. I had not seen him before as far as I know. He turned round and apologised, say<lb/>ing, "Accident, accident." I believe he was reading a paper or a</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250104"/>
               <p>letter. I saw him on several occasions afterwards in the neighbour<lb/>hood. In the middle of November I went into the employ of Mr. De Yong, a wholesale warehouseman, and I lived at his private house with my wife; he occupied 156, Houndsditch and also No. 16. No. 156 is on the left-hand side coming down from Bishopsgate. I first lived at No. 16 and then at No. 156. I had to open the premises at No. 16 and lock them up again. I would then go to help at No. 156, where my employer then came to live as well. My wife used to get the keys of No. 16 from Mr. De Yong and at night time I would return them to him. On the night of November 30, I think it was, he was away at a police boxing competition, and I was unable to get the keys from him to lock up No. 16, and I had to wait there; George Crooks was with me. I heard the clock strike 12 and I went out to see if I could see my employer. As I was at the door a man whom I know now to be Gardstein, said, "Good night." I said, "It's a fine night, too." He thereupon came back and inquired what was the matter with the night. I replied that it was morning. We had some chaffing talk and we began talking about the jewellery line. He asked me what sort of business Myers, who was a few doors down, had, and the conversation came round to Harris's shop. He said Harris was the best jeweller in Houndsditch. I said I did not know Harris's. He said he believed he lived on the premises; I said I did not know and that he had better go and ask him. He then went away. I had seen him twice before. The first time was a few days before this. He was just by Stoney Lane with Vassileva and Peter the Painter; it was between one and two p.m. I did not know their names at the time. The second time I saw Gardstein before November 30 was midday in Houndsditch with Peter the Painter and Trassjonsky. I subsequently identified Gardstein's body. About 12.30 p.m. on December 12 I saw Gardstein with Peters, Dubof, Federof, and a tall man in "The Three Nuns "Public-house. Gardstein nodded to me. I saw him subsequently coming from Gar<lb/>diner's Corner, Commercial Road. In the course of my duties I generally go out between 8.10 and 8.20 a.m. to shop with Mrs. De Yong; I used sometimes to go through Cutler Street. In about the middle of the first week in December I was going out in this way when I saw Rosen and Dubof coming out of Exchange Buildings; Rosen was carrying a green canvas bag and I believe Dubof a brown bag. Exhibit 94 is similar to the green canvas bag. Vassileva, who was at the corner of Exchange Buildings, appeared to be seeing the men down the street; they were in front going towards Houndsditch. I was going the opposite way. I had never seen Rosen before this day. The next time I saw him was in that same week; I was standing in Middlesex Street and he passed me. You can get there by going down Cutler Street. He was alone and was carrying two bags, one of which was the green canvas bag I had seen on the first occasion, and the other bag was similar to the one I had seen Dubof carrying. I saw him the next day in Stoney Lane carrying, I believe, the same canvas bag. In the early part of February I identified him at the Bishopsgate Police</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250105"/>
               <p>Station. A few days after I had seen Dubof with Rosen and Vassi<lb/>leva at Exchange Buildings, I saw him with Federof and Peters, I believe, by Aldgate Church. On the first Sunday in December, I think it was, I saw Vassileva with Trassjonsky turn down Stoney Lane; I know it was after November 30. The first time I saw her she was wearing a three-quarter blue coat, similar to Exhibit 92, and I believe a white blouse; her hair seemed to be dark brownâdarker than it is now. I identified Peters and Dubof. I pointed out Vassi<lb/>leva in Buross Street.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. It is true thai I said in my evidence on Feb<lb/>ruary 14 that Dubof when he ran into me was "clean shaven then as he is now"; I (believe his face is similar now to what it was then. I am absolutely positive that the man who ran into me was the same man I saw later. It was some time about or before the middle of October when he ran into me. I was still in the employ of the rubber company. On about October 18 or 19 I moved from Hopwood Street to Maida Vale; I had then left the rubber company. No. 16 and 156 are both wholesale houses; but Mr. De Yong lives on the premises. About 30 men are employed at No. 16. I identified Federof, who was eventually discharged. I saw him, I believe on two occasions. The second occasion I saw Dubof was not Decem<lb/>ber 12; it was about December 12. The third occasion I saw him was in "The Three Nuns"; I have only seen him on three occasions. It was in the early part of the evening that I saw Dubof with Peters and Federof outside Aldgate Church; it may have been between 10 and 12 p.m. I remember now it was late in the evening. I cannot say the date when I identified Dubof, Peters, and Federof; I identified them all on the same occasion; it may have been Decem<lb/>ber 23. I should say most of the people from whom I picked them, 16 or 17 in number, were foreigners; there were not many English<lb/>men. Mr. De Yong discharged me because he said I was not suited for the situation.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. I cannot fix the first time I saw Rosen nearer than it was at the beginning of December; it was about December 12. As far as I saw he was wearing dark clothes and a dark cap. It was the first time I had seen him and I identified him two months later. I do not say that I could identify all the people I saw that morning; but I had cause to remember him; you do not see many people like him walking about London. When I saw him the next day it was about the same time in the morning. He was still wearing a cap; I do not think he had a bowler hat. I may have seen the photographs of Fritz and Rosen; I have seen 150 photographs. It was a police-in<lb/>spector who first came and asked me to identify Rosen. He may have shown me a photograph and asked me whether I recognised it. When Inspector Newell was giving evidence on February 15 I was sitting by someone, but I do not know who it was; I do not remember asking Mrs. Goodman if she had ever seen a photograph of Rosen, nor saying that I had done so. I know Mrs. Rosen by sight. She may have been sitting the other side of me.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250106"/>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart: I saw a good many photographs before I went to Buross Street, and identified Vassileva. I think this is the first time I have seen this photograph of Millstein, which is handed to me. I have identified Trassjonsky, but not Millstein. I left the Rubber Company without notice after being there about six weeks; no notice was necessary. I can state the reason if desired. I was then for three or four weeks out of employment. I was again out of employ<lb/>ment at the end of January. I have never spoken to Vassileva. If a number of witnesses come forward to say that Dubof was working miles away at the time I saw him, I still say I am not mistaken. I first gave a description of Vassileva, on December 17; I described her as being 28 or 30 years of age; I have not heard that she is only 23. I said she was well built. It was on the second occasion when I saw her that she was wearing a shawl over her head; I passed right close to her. The shawl was over her ears. When she turned round I saw her hair; the shawl went a bit back. I do not know if I have said before that the shawl went a bit back. Crooks and Solly Abrahams were with me the first time I saw her; they were fellow<lb/>employes. I believe on the two other occasions I saw her she was wearing a black felt hat; it may have been velvet; I think it was a kind of miniature "merry widow" hat. I know what a toque is; it was not a toque. It was trimmed with some black material. I do not say that it was one of those immense "merry widow" hats; it was medium size. The police came to me from time to time between December 17 and February 14 and asked questions. (To the Jury). I was shown photographs before I went to identify scertain people.</p>

                  </persName> (recalled). Cross-examination continued by Mr. Stewart. In nine cases out of ten I could remember a man who jostled me in the street. Dubof carried the green bag on one occasion and Rosen on the other. On the occasions when I saw Vassileva she was with men, one of whom was believed to be Peter the Painter. The picture (Exhibit 146) is that of the man I saw walking on two occasions with Vassileva.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Before I picked out Rosen, Dubof, Peters, and Vas<lb/>sileva, I had never seen photographs of them. After Dubof jostled me I saw him many times in Shepherd's Bush. On the occasion when I saw Vassileva wearing a blue three-quarter coat she had a black hat on with velvet round the rim.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. On December 27 I went to 44, Gould Street (Gardstein's lodgings) and saw Mr. and Mrs. Kempler there who pointed out Gardstein's room; the back room on the ground floor. I found in that room a six-grooved Browning pistol (Exhibit 77); about 150 loose Mauser cartridges; a bullet (Ex<lb/>hibit 78); and another 150 Mauser cartridges. I found a number of rifle cartridges similar to those found at Sidney Street. A dagger (Exhibit 79); a butt for a Mauser pistol (Exhibit 80); and a quantity</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250107"/>
               <p>of documents. I had control of the identification. Dubof, Peters, and Rosen said they had no complaint to make with regard to the identifi<lb/>cation. On the occasion of Vassileva's identification the same pro<lb/>cedure was adopted, and on one occasion one of the witnesses picked out another women standing by the side of Vassileva as being the woman he had seen in Exchange Buildings.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. I am not able to say definitely that an official description of the men wanted was published on the Monday after the murder; the descriptions published were those of young men, Russians. I had nothing to do with it. We had two different solicitors and a representative of the Russian Consulate on more than one occasion at the identification, and they expressed great satisfaction with the fair<lb/>ness of it. The prisoners were not put in a room where people would have an opportunity of looking through the windows at them. Peters and Dubof were told that they were to be identified on a charge of murder. It is usual for police officers in charge of the case to stand in the room when identification is being carried out.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. I do not know whether any of the persons who identified Rosen had previously seen a photograph of him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stewart. The procedure adopted in the case of the identification of Vassileva was exactly the same as in the other cases. Richardson was taken to Buross Street, where Vassileva lived, to identify her. I had not heard of Peter the Painter before Decem<lb/>ber 16. His description was circulated shortly after.</p>

At the time Dubof and Peters were, arrested, and when they were identified by the witnesses, I was not in possession of any photographs of them; it was not until they had been before the Alderman and identified. At the time Vassileva was arrested and charged I had no portrait of her. I had Rosen's portrait at the time of his arrest; I gave it to Inspector Newell. I have it now.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. The police did not have a photograph of Fritz. I have a description of Fritz which is a fairly good description of Rosen.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. Prior to December 16 the City Police had no information with regard to Peter the Painter. His clothes are detailed in his description.</p>

Mr. De Yong went to a City Police boxing competi<lb/>tion on November 30; I waited with George Richardson for the keys; he was at the door and I was about 12 yards away. Someone came and spoke to him; then walked on a couple of steps and came back; he asked him about the warehouse and what wages he got a week. They had some conversation about jewellery. The stranger asked who was the richest jewellers in Houndsditchâif Myers was Richardson said, "Oh, no, they are only tuppenny ha'penny jewellers"; the man coitinued, "Harris's must be the richest jewellers, then?" Richardson said, "Oh, they are high-class jewellers"; the man said, "Did Mr. Harris live on the premises?"</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250108"/>
               <p>Richardson said, "You had better go and find out if you want to know." The man went away within two or three minutes after that. In December I went to the City Mortuary and saw the dead body of the man who had spoken to Richardson. Exhibit 3 is a photograph of the man I saw. I saw him two or three nights afterwards with other people in "The Three Nuns," Aldgate; afterwards in Houndsditch with Peter the Painter and Vassileva about midday. I next saw Vassileva at Bishopsgate Police Station with other people when I went there for the purpose of identification.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I identified Vassileva about a fortnight after I had seen her in the street with the man. I met Richardson and Abrahams in dinner times and tea times. Peter the Painter was a superior looking man. I have seen the portraits of Peter the Painter, which were circulated broadcast in London; after December 16 his name was known all over the East End of London.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Mr. Joseph Goodman, 35, Newcastle Place, Aldgate. I live on the second floor and was there all last year. On the floor below a man named Tracomchik came to live, and was afterwards joined by Luba Millstein. The man in Exhibit 3 (Gardstein) came very frequently, letting himself in with a key, or sometimes knocking. Trassjonsky used to come there, also Rosen and Dubof. There was not much furniture in the room. In January I went to 11, Exchange Buildings, and afterwards to 50, Grove Street, and recognised the things there as having been at 35, Newcastle Place. To Mr. Melville. I think Fritz and Luba Millstein left Newcastle Place before the end of October. I said at the police court I had seen Dubof call at the house more than once, but I have never seen Peters. Trassjonsky, Hoffman, and Federof also called.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. Rosen occasionally visited Fritz. A man named Richardson did not show me a photograph of Rosen when I was at the Guildhall Police Court.</p>

                  </hi>, 12, Exchange Buildings. Last year I was in the employ of Mr. De Yong learning to be a salesman. I there knew Richardson and Crooks. I rememnber Nos. 9, 10, and 11, Exchange Buildings being empty. No. 9 was occupied first for about two weeks; then No. 10; I do not know who lived there; then No. 11. No. 9 became empty five or six weeks before December 16. No. 10 was taken by three men, but became empty after No. 11 had been taken a week, about three weeks before December 16. I used to see a man I now know to be Gardstein about 8.15 of a morning as I was going to work. I met him the week of the 16th up to the Wednesday I saw some furniture being taken into No. 11 by a man while Gardstein stood in the doorwayâsome chairs, a looking-glass, and a couch. One day, while playing ball, it knocked at the door of No. 11, which was opened by Trassjonsky, but I never saw her again there or any other woman. I saw Dubof and Rosen go to No. 11 About a week before No. 11 was occupied I saw Dubof walking up and down the street noticing the houses. I next saw him at three o'clock in the afternoon on the Sunday before the 16th. I saw Rosen with Gard<lb/>stein the day the furniture was moved in and I have seen Rosen going to No. 11 by himself. I have seen Dubof, Vassileva, Gardstein, Trassjonsky, and Peter the Painter in Houndsditch. I have been with George Richardson and Crooks when I have seen them. The last time I saw anybody going in or coming out of No. 11 was on the Wednesday before the 16th, when I met Gardstein, who spoke to me. I was at home on the 16th after nine o'clock and heard the shots. I went the next day to 59, Grove Street and saw the man's dead body and on the ground floor Trassjonsky.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I have not said I saw Vassileva with Dubof. Gardstein was a rough kind of man; Peter the Painter smart look<lb/>ing. I have seen Trassjonsky, Gardstein, and Peter the Painter together. I have seen Vassileva with Gardstein and another man I did not properly catch sight of. I have not seen Vassileva in Cutler Street or Exchange Buildings, but in Houndsditch. I have seen Rosen with Peter the Painter. I have never seen any woman going in or coming out of No. 9. There is an incandescent light between No. 11 and No. 12.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. I first saw Dubof walking up and down Exchange Buildings about a week before No. 11 was occupied. I could not say what time in the day. I saw him on a Sunday and on a week-day; the first occasion was a week-day. I did not say at the police court, "I am not sure whether it was a Sunday." I said, "I am not sure what</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250110"/>
               <p>time it was." The third time I saw the man was in Houndsditch before the Sunday. At the time I saw Dubof in Houndsditch I was employed at De Yong's. I do not recollect the date I left there; I cannot remember dates; I do not say it was the 9th. I left De Yong's about a week before the murders and worked at a barber's shop from the Tuesday to the Friday.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. I saw Rosen on two occasions before I identified him, going into Exchange Buildings once by himself and once with Gardstein; on the second occasion he was alone. The man I saw with Gardstein and Vassileva was not Rosen, but someone who re<lb/>sembles him. I first saw Rosen with Gardstein and then with Vassi<lb/>leva. It was two months later when I identified Rosen. I have seen photographs of Peter the Painter and Gardstein, but not of Rosen or the other prisoners. Inspector McLean took me to the station to identify Rosen; he did not show me a photograph of him. I made a mistake at the police court with regard to the second occa<lb/>sion of seeing Rosen. I only saw him twice before identifying him two months later; he was wearing a dark suit and a cap. I cannot remember the dates. The first time I saw him with Gardstein was about 8.15 in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>, 5, Exchange Buildings, E. I was living at my pre-sent address in last December. No. 11 is on the opposite side. For about two weeks before December 16 I noticed Vassileva between 11 and 12 a.m. taking down the shutters there; I cannot remember when I last saw her before the 16th. I did not see her at all on that day. I also saw at No. 11 a clean-shaven man; Exhibit 3 is not his photo-graph; it is the photograph of a man I saw about two weeks before the 16th doing something to the lock of No. 9. He said to me, "Good morning, Baby." I did not afterwards recognise or see any picture of the clean-shayen man. I cannot say whether Vassileva was there when I saw him. Some weeks after the 16th I identified Vassileva at the police station.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I do not know whether the "Merry Widow" hat is not the kind of hat best calculated to display the hair. I do not know Trassjonsky. I know Solomon Abrahams; I see him in the mornings sometimes. When I was first taken to the station I failed to recognise anyone; I was taken to recognise a man, not a woman. I picked out Vassileva from 15 or 20 people. She looked ill. I do not know whether any of the others looked ill; I did not look at them. The last time I saw her was three or four days before the 16th. I saw her nearly every morning before then, and then I did not see her at all for three or four days before the 16th, although I was there as usual. I daresay a person on the first floor on my house looking down could see through the space above the windows of No. 11.</p>

                  </hi>, 13, Ely Terrace, Stepney. I am employed by Mr. Marks, a secondhand clothes dealer, of No. 1, Exchange Building, and was so employed last November and December; I worked from</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250111"/>
               <p>8.15 a.m. till about 5 p.m. On December 23, at Bishopsgate police station I picked out Peters and Federof from among 20 men. On December 14 I saw them outside No. 2, Exchange Buildings. Federof went across the road to No. 9, leaving Peters standing outside No. 2. Peters walked up and down and then went across to No. 9 and waited. Federof then came out and they waited. A man named Levi then came out of No. 11 and went to the top of the street. They followed him. This was the last time I saw them, but I had seen them together many times before when I have been at my business at No. 1. I used to see Peters about 2 p.m. It was mostly about 9 a.m. that I saw them together. I have seen Peters on three or four occasions. One went into No. 2 and one went across the road to No. 9. I have seen Peters on his own once, when he went into No. 11. On February 8 at Bishopsgate Police Station I recognised Vassileva as the woman I had seen at No. 11 taking down and putting up shutters. I did not see furniture being moved into No. 11. The day after it became occupied she asked me to clean the windows of No. 11, and I refused; this was about three weeks before the 16th. I saw her for the last time on the 15th. I have seen Rosen at No. 11 about three times. On one of the occasions he was with Vassileva when she asked me to clean the windows and on another occasion I saw him going out of No. 11 in the afternoon with two bags, one of which was similar to Exhibit 94. Vassileva's hair was dark then. (To the Court.) I saw Federof take a handle out of his pocket with which he opened the door of No. 9, while Peters was standing opposite. Whenever Federof went in No. 9 he did that.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. I identified Federof, but he was afterwards dis<lb/>charged. I saw him and Peters about two days after they moved into No. 9. I generally saw Peters on week days, some time after break<lb/>fast. I could be sure which of the men I saw go into No. 9 on the first occasion I saw them if I had both men here. (Peters stood up.) It was the other one (Federof) that went inside. I saw Federof a lot of times; I always saw him with Peters. The second occasion I saw them Federof walked across the road and went into No. 9 and Peters walked up and down. On all occasions I saw them it was some time after breakfast. There were three or four occasions., It is true I said at the police court that I had seen Federof seven or eight times standing outside No. 2 always in the morning. There is no doubt that every time I saw Peters I also saw Federof.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. The first time I saw Rosen was when he was with Vassileva; it was about three weeks before the 16th, at about 11.30 a.m. I cannot remember how he was dressed. A couple of days after<lb/>wards I saw him go into No. 11 in the afternoon. The third time was in the evening; it might have been a day or two after. I do not remember how he was dressed then. I have never seen his photograph. I have also seen Fritz in Exchange Buildings; I cannot say if he resembles Rosen. I have seen Fritz go into No. 11 as well, but not with Rosen.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250112"/>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. From the first floor of our premises you can see into the windows of No. 11. I was never asked by anybody to clean the windows of No. 9. Vassileva showed no desire to escape obser<lb/>vation. The man I saw some out of No. 11 was about 5 ft. 9 in., with a sallow complexion, but a clear skin; he was clean-shaven. I should say he had dark eyes. He always wore a light overcoat. I am posi<lb/>tive only one man went in No. 9 when I saw Federof and Peters for the first time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stewart was about to put to the witness his depositions to show that the evidence he had given before did not coincide with his present evidence, when Mr. Justice Grantham stated that it was very unusual for counsel to cross-examine on a point which had nothing to do with his own client and which had already been dealt with by counsel for other prisoners.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stewart stated that he wished to test the witness's recollection, but that he would not continue further.</p>
               <p>Further cross-examined by Mr. Bryan. I do not remember say<lb/>ing at the police court that the third occasion on which I saw Rosen was on the same day as the second occasion; they were not on the same day.</p>

About two weeks before December 16 I saw the newcomers, one of whom was Vassileva. The other was a man; I should not recognise his photograph. I saw Vassileva about twice sweeping from the kitchen into the street. On February 8 I identified her at Bishops-gate Police Station. Her hair was a lot darker when I saw her at No. 11. I was at the public-house on the night of December 16. The pendant lamps outside were alight at 11.30 p.m. Both bars look out in Cutler Street; and a side exit into Exchange Buildings.

               <p>To Mr. Melville. I saw Federof go in and out of No. 10 several times; I am certain it was No. 10. I have never seen Dubof go into No. 10. There is a door leading out of the "Cutler's Arms" into Exchange Buildings. I do not think the frosted glass on it comet more than half-way up. I should not like to say that it would no; be impossible for me standing in the oar to look through the door into Exchange Buildings. We should have the door kept shut in Decem<lb/>ber. I could see anybody going into Exchange Buildings, though not anyone in the street. I know I saw Dubof on December 10, but I cannot recollect the time of day; I saw him on several occasions in the week following the 10th, but I do not know the times. It was not from behind the bar that I noticed Federof and Dubof. I may have been walking up and down the street when I saw them. I was not exactly the barman at the "Cutler's Arms.' I always left some<lb/>body in charge when I left the bar to go into the street. These murders were the common topic of conversation in the bar after the 16th, but I did not take any part in it as I was too busy.</p>

On December 23 at Bishopsgate Police Station I identified Dubof as the man I had seen at midday on December 11 coming down Exchange Buildings. He spoke to a man who was standing opposite No. 11. They stood for some moments and the door then opened and they went in. I did not see them come out. Dubof was wearing an ordi<lb/>nary brown suit of clothes with rather a stripe. Exhibit 3 is a photo<lb/>graph of the man he spoke to; that is the only time I can swear to having seen him.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. When I went to the police station on Decem<lb/>ber 23 I did not know the nationality of the men that were wanted. I read the papers, but I do not think they stated that Russians were wanted; I do not think at that time there was any official description given. Before identifying Dubof I was put in a room with some others. I there saw Isaac Levy, whom I knew. I did not talk with him about the affair. I cannot say if my son was in there as well. Da Costa, whom I know, may have beep. We did not all talk about it together; I do not think they allowed us to speak.</p>

               <p>Re-examined. I did not know who was in custody when I got to the police station. I did not see Dubof in any part of the police station on that day before I picked him out.</p>

                  </hi>, paperhanger, 11, Buross Street, E. In April last year Vassileva came and took the back room on the ground floor. She was a cigarette maker and she used to go out about 7.30 or 8 a.m. and return at 8 or 8.30 p.m. She also used to work in the evenings till 12, she said, for customers. Generally on Sundays she stayed indoors, but sometimes she might go out. On Sundays, amongst others, Rosen and Dubof used to come and visit her. I knew Rosen as "The Barber" and Dubof as "Yoorka." Two years ago Dubof worked for me for about a fortnight; he left, and I did not see him again until last summer. When visiting Vassileva Dubof said that he called for cigarettes. I cannot say if he came on any other day but Sunday as I used to go out to work. Rosen started coming a long time ago; he used to come regular; sometimes once a fortnight and sometimes every Sunday. Gardstein has been to the house two or three times. Vassileva's hair was brownish flax; the colour of it now is nearly as it was then. About six or seven weeks before Christ<lb/>mas she left the house saying she was going to a friend named Masha at 40 or 42, Broomhead Street, who was not well. She was away three weeks, but sometimes every day and sometimes once in every two days she used to come back for a blouse or a handkerchief. She returned one Sunday and went away again the following morning, saying she must go as the manager at the place where she worked was ill. She remained away three weeks. She returned on the evening of December 17. I did not know she had come back; I went to drop a penny in the gas meter in her room at about 8.30 p.m. I did not recognise her as her hair was black. She was tearing up papers and throwing them into the fireplace. I said, "What is the matter with you? I did not recognise you." She said, "The guvnor's wifeâthe missusâis an old woman and she painted her hair, so I also painted mine." My wife passed by into the yard and I called her in and said, "Lena is here." She came into the room and I went out; I did not hear what she said. Before she came in I asked Vassileva why she was burning the papers. She said, "Did not you hear what has taken place? They will come and search everybody. I will give you some other papers to hide, but you should not keep them in your own possession"; I said, "I will take it to my children and they will hide it properly. (Mr. Stewart submitted that evidence as to these papers was inadmissable until it was proposed to be shown that they were connected with the conspiracy. Mr. Justice Grantham held that it was admissible under any circumstances.) My eldest child is 42 years old. At 10 the following morning I knocked at Vassileva's door. She opened it and gave me the parcel. She said she was ill. She shed tears over the photo of Gardstein in the paper. She said, "Do you know what a man he was "; she said he was her lover or her young man. She said, "A friend of Gardstein's unintentionally shot him." I do not remember anything more happening, my wife came into the room and Vassileva handed her three photos, which I added to the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250115"/>
               <p>parcel. I then went to my son-in-law and we went to the police station with the parcel. Later that day some police officers came and saw Vassil-eva. I do not remember anyone else besides those officers coming in the evening. On the Monday morning I knocked at her door and went in. She was in bed. She asked me as a favour to go to a doctor who lived at Whitechapel. I asked her what she wanted him for and she told me to ask him to be good enough to come to her. I said, "Why do you want the doctor here! Cannot you go to the doctor's placet" She said that he was a good friend of hers and she wanted to ask him whether he would undertake to say that she was there at his place a few daysâseveral days. I did not go and she went herself. After two or three hours she returned, and said, "There is no more good friends for me"âhe had chucked her out. Oh the next day, Tuesday, she packed up a small parcel and called in my wife and said, "I am going to Paris"; this was about 10 a.m. She returned the street door key and said, "What is due to you in respect of money I will send you on and the rest of the articles that remain here I will leave to you." She left taking the parcel with her. She returned at bout 9 p.m. I asked her why she had come back, and she said, "It is very unpleasant. I am watched every footstep. I cannot leave this country; I must remain here." She remained with me till she was arrested. At first she did not go out and at night time she kept always washing her head with spirit vinegar soda. She used to go out mostly in the evening. On one occasion I came into the room she burnt a blouse and a hat. The hat was already burnt with paraffin when I came in; I do not know if it was black or red. This was on a Wed<lb/>nesday; the next time I see her burning was on Saturday, when she was burning the blue stuff of a skirt. When she came back on the Tuesday evening after she had left saying she was going to Paris I do not remember exactly what was said, but something was spoken, and I said, "However, the Almighty will make we will have to take for good," and she said, "Oh, don't speak about the Almighty." She said, "If I get two weeks here it would not be so bad, but if I am sent back to Russia I will get hanged."For three weeks after burning the skirt she did not go out at all; afterwards she started going out for a little while and coming back again; and in the evenings she used to go out and come in; up to the time she was arrested she always slept in the house. I remember now she was away the week before she was arrested. She left saying she was going to a good friend. She re<lb/>turned on the day of her arrest, Tuesday. I had no opportunity to talk to her. When she returned on the night of the shooting affray she told us everything where she was; she said she was down there but she was not at the shooting; she left that place at five o'clock.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. I said at the police court that Dubof had been to see Vassileva about four times. I saw him for the last time last summer.</p>
               <p>On Mr. Bodkin inquiring, counsel for the prisoners stated that they did not desire to put any questions to Chief Inspector Hayes or the</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. Cross-examined by Mr. Bryan. Rosen sometimes visited Vassileva at Buross Street. I employed a man named Carl Hoffman at Buross Street; he used to call with reference to work and to see Vassileva. I do not know that Hoffman and Rosen were friends. Hoffman came to my house sometimes with Rosen. Rosen and Hoffman used to go into Vassileva's room occasionally. Rosen sometimes went on a Sunday in the middle of the day and the evening.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. No. 11, Buross Street is a perfectly respectable house. Vassileva was a perfectly respectable and well behaved young woman; friendly towards me and my family, and quiet. She said she earned 30s. a week and sometimes made cigarettes in the evening as well. As far as I know that was the only work she did. She used to leave at 8 and half-past 8 a.m. and return at 8.30 p.m. She paid 4s. for her room and 3d. for the cleaning. For two or three weeks she had dinners at my place; then she provided her own food. She used to go out sometimes in the evening but returned immediately. She usually spent her Sundays at home and the Saturday afternoons. I do not know the name of the man (Exhibit 3), but he was not called "Gardstein." I have not seen Peter the Painter. I do not know people named Pearlman with whom she used to live. I do not know men called Bifstek and "The Captain," or if they came to buy cigarettes. I know a woman named Masha, a friend of Vassileva's. Vassileva's is the right-hand figure in Exhibit 98. I have never seen Masha's sister. In the photograph of Masha's sister she has a fur muff and stole. Vassileva paid me the rent for the three weeks she had been away when she returned on the Sunday and said that she would have to go away again, and after, when she returned, she had no money at all. We had the keys and could have gone into her room at any time; there was no attempt at concealment. If she wanted to touch anything in the room she could. Inspector Wensley was in the room on Sunday, December 18, for an hour and a half. I gave the police the bundle which Vassileva handed to me. The police took away a bottle from Vassileva's room with other property. I have only spoken to the police once, when I attended to hand over the parcel on the 18th. The police watched my house from the 18th, watching for Peter the Painter, I heard. My girl read the paper to Vassileva about Peter the Painter; she seemed very anxious, and when it was said that Peter the Painter had gone to Paris, she said, "They do not know what they are looking for; Peter the Painter was never in existence "; she wanted me to believe that Peter the Painter was not amongst the lot. She was dreadfully grieved and crying; ill. She asked me that I should go and call the doctor. I asked her, "What do you want the doctor for?" so she said, "You go to him and tell him, as he is a good friend of mine, that I want him, and he will come"; I did not</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250117"/>
               <p>go, she went herself. She said she wanted somewhere to stay for a few nights. I do not know where she went, but when she came back I asked what the doctor said and she replied, "There is no more good friends; I was a good friend to everybody." I remember giving evidence at the Guildhall when I said she told me "she should not come to him because she would bring trouble." On the day she said she was going to Paris she said." London is no good for me "; this was on the Monday, not the Tuesday. She told me if she went to Russia she would be hanged. I do not suggest she was guilty of any crime in Russia. I do not know if she made a blouse out of her blue skirt. Masha called on Saturday evening, December 17, 10 minutes before Vassileva came in, and asked whether a parcel had arrived for Vassileva. After the shooting' affair I used sometimes to be in Vas-sileva's room; she was all day there. In the two or three weeks after the washed her head she used to go out for two or three hours after dinner; sometimes she returned at sunset. I should not say that on the occasions when she had been out she came back and found me in her room. I said before the Alderman "we were altogether; we used to go in her room and my room." After the shoot<lb/>ing affair she was very tired, not well, and she asked me to come in her room to assist and sympathise with her. On the Sunday I told her not to burn any more papers, but to give them to me to keep for her. She said, "All the foreigners will be traced; I do not want it; you will keep it as well"; I told her I would take it to my children. I took it to the police the same day. The police paid me money for the Guildhall, but nothing else; 10s. 4d. Apart from that I have not received any money for looking after Vassileva. I have not received 15s. a week in reference to this case; neither 15 farthings.</p>
               <p>Re-examined by Mr. Bodkin. On the Monday after the Saturday Vassileva said that she was going to the doctor's to ask him to do her a favour; to say that he has kept her several nights. There was a bottle in her room (Exhibit 99) containing some spirit with which she washed her head, and a sponge (Exhibit 100).</p>

                  </hi>, wife of Isaac Gordon, 11, Buross Street. Vassileva came to lodge with me about 12 months ago; she was there eight months. At the Guildhall I saw a man I called the Barber, and Zurka, who used to visit her. (The witness went near the dock and pointed to Dubof and Rosen.) They used to come sometimes on Sundays; some-times in the middle of the week. Hoffman used to come sometimes. Seven weeks before Christmas Vassileva stopped away from home; she said she was going to her friend Masha, who was ill; she was away three weeks. She returned on a Sunday, paid me three weeks' rent, and said she was going away for another few weeks. She said she had to go to her guvnor's, who was ill, to manage the place. On the Monday she made up a parcel of clothes and went away. I did not see her for three weeks till the day after the shooting, at half-past eight in the evening in her room at my place. I noticed she looked with black hair; it was flaxy colour before she went away. I asked her what was the matter with her hair, but she did not answer. She never</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250118"/>
               <p>gave any reason for the change of colour at first, but afterwards she said she dyed her hair, but did not give any reason for it. We heard of the shooting on the Saturday and spoke to her about it. I asked her if she had heard what had happened in London, and she replied that she had heard nothing of it in the country. She did not say what part of the country she had been in. On the Sunday Vassileva lay in bed till the afternoon. Masha called to see her on the Satur<lb/>day night and Sunday morning. The Barber came on the Sunday evening and was there for about an hour. About 10 or 15 minutes after Rosen left the detectives came. My husband had a conversation with Vassileva on the Monday; she went to the doctor. On the Tues<lb/>day we saw a parcel in her room; she said she was going to Paris; she gave me the key of the street door, and said she must go away. She came back about eight o'clock and said "It is impossible to go away; I am being watched." She said "As I cannot leave England I will have to stay in London, and what will happen let happen." She was white and very much agitated and nervous. When she came back she used to lay out the cards and guess on them. She used to wash her hair with spirits. For three weeks she did not go out only to buy spirits and soap; she was five weeks indoors, and then on the Monday she went away after supper and returned on the following Tuesday week, when she was arrested at the corner of Sidney Street; I was with her. When she came back on Saturday, the 17th, she burnt some dark blue stuff like the stuff of a skirt. I think Vassileva had a white hat and a coloured one. On the Saturday after the murders I noticed on the top of a box in her room a fur muff; the following week we had a conversation about it. I told her I could not wait for the money she owed me, and she replied "take that fur muff which cost me Â£3, and take it to the pawnshop; you will, I daresay, get 25s. or 30s. in the pawn, then you will have some money." Afterwards she said Masha had bought it as a present for her. I gave evidence twice at the Guild-hall. I kept the muff and stole as she told me to; she said, "If I will be lucky and won't be arrested I will go to work and will take it away from you." I think it was February 27, when I gave the muff to the police.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. I said at the police court "The last time I saw Dubof at the house was last summer. I cannot say when." He called on Vassileva for cigarettes.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. Hoffman was employed at my house; he was a friend of Rosen. On Sunday, 18th, Rosen called alone in the even<lb/>ing. I found the barber, Nina, and Masha in Nina's room on the Sunday before the detectives came. I do not know how long Rosen was with Vassileva; he did not tell me he had come to see Hoffman.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I cannot read Russian. I gave evidence three times at the Guildhall. I there said what Vassileva had said, "If I am lucky and am not arrested I will take them back." I said it at the Guildhall and told the detectives the same thing. Nobody has given me any money for taking care of Vassileva. I have not been (paid 15s. a week since December 18; prisoner owes me nine weeks rent and five weeks food. Nina once took me to the Jubilee Street</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250119"/>
               <p>Club; there were a number of Russians there, but I could not say who they were; music and dancing took place and speeches. I did not know the names of the men who called at the house till they appeared in the paper. Zurka called perhaps three times. I heard my girl read the papers to Vassileva, but did not understand it; she is 12 years old. I do not know Peter the Painter; I saw the picture of the man who was shot in the papers; I know now his name is Gard-stein. Masha wore furs like those Nina had in her room. The detec<lb/>tives were in the room about an hour and a half. Nina said Masha was a good friend of hers, and, as she was ill, she was going to attend her. Vassileva did not say Masha gave her the furs for her kindness. Two or three weeks after the detective called somebody knocked at the door for money for the furs; Nina said, "I cannot understand the man calling here for money; Masha bought it and Masha will pay."</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The friend she went to nurse was Masha; up to that time I had never seen Vassileva with furs; she told me they were a present from Masha.</p>

                  </hi>, daughter of last witness. Vassileva went away seven weeks before Christmas; she said she had been nursing a sick friend, Masha; the second time she said she was going to the gover<lb/>nor's to be manager as he was ill. She was away for three weeks and came back on the Saturday; I saw her and noticed her hair was a different colour; when she went away it was flaxen, but that night it was brown. I went into her room and she asked me to read about the Houndsditch affair in the paper. She understands English. There was a description of a woman in the paperâheight, 5 ft. 8 in. After reading it Vassileva seemed very miserable; she measured herself with a yard stick and said she was exactly the same height as men<lb/>tioned in the paper. I did not see her do anything in regard to her clothes. I read to her the description of the woman's clothes; it said a woman with a three-quarter jacket and skirt; I believe it was blue. I do not remember Vassileva saying anything about the dress.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. The paper I read was the "Evening Times" 6.30 edition. Vassileva does not wear shoes; she wears black boots. When she came back on the Saturday she wore the same clothes as when she went away. I do not remember reading about Mr. Cohen, of 10, Cutler Street, telling the Press Association that the police had found in 11, Exchange Buildings enough dynamite to blow up the whole of Houndsditch. I do not remember reading "Mr. Cohen believes that the woman was a man disguised." I read all except the latest news. I read the description of the men wanted. I saw the picture of Gardstein in the paper. Vassileva put on her hat.) Nina did not wear that hat before the murders; she wore a white hat. I do not remember her wearing it; she wore a white hat right up to December.</p>

                  </persName>, Metropolitan Police. I had certain information with regard to the Houndsditch crimes on December 18. I was in Arbour Square police station when Gordon</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250120"/>
               <p>came in and handed me this bundle of papers and photographs (pro-duced). He made a communication to me, and at 10.30 p.m. I went with two other officers to 11, Buross Street. I had not heard of Rosen or Vassileva before. Vassileva was in her room; her hair was hanging down her back and had obviously been dyed. I said to her "Do you understand English?" She said, "Just a little." I said, "We are police officers, and I want to speak with you. Do you under-stand me?" She said "Yes, if you don't speak too quick." I said, "What is your name, where do you come from, and what are you?" She said, "Nina Vassiley (as I understood it). I am a Russian, and I make cigarettes." I said, "We have been told that you were a member of the club at Jubilee Street." She said, "I used to go there sometimes." I said, "Do you know that some police officers were shot at Hounsditch on Friday night?" She said, "I heard of it." I said, "Some of the men who were engaged in the shooting are said to have been members of that club. Do you know them?" She said, "Per-haps I do; perhaps I don't." I then said, "We have been told that you have been away from home this three weeks, and only came home yesterday." She said, "It's a lie; I have always been here." I then said, "I am also told that you have some bullets and cartridges here." She said, "I have not; you can look, gentlemen, if you like." We found nothing there. I showed her photographs that Gordon had given me, one of which was a group in which was Gardstein, and asked her whose photos they were. She said "I do not know." We then left. Observation was then kept on the house. I reported the matter to the City Police, and as far as I know they watched the house from the following day. I only looked for ammunition. I took possession of no<lb/>thing. I did not know at that time that any importance was attached to a muff or furs. I attached no importance to finger-prints. (Chief-inspector Willis here produced a photograph of Gardstein when alive (Exhibit 76), found by him at 44, Gold Street.).</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. Gardstein was a good-looking man. I cannot dis<lb/>tinguish Vassileva's photograph in this group (Exhibit 103a). I see in it nobody connected with this case. If Federof is here, it would be the man with the moustache. Vassileva did not seek to conceal her address from me. She speaks English very imperfectly. Since December 18 I have made as many inquiries as possible in the limited space of time as to her antecedents; I do not suggest she has a criminal record of any kind. I cannot translate the names of the books Gordon handed me. I should think we were 45 minutes with her. I did not see a bottle. I know one was found in her room, I presume about Feb<lb/>ruary 17. The Jubilee Street Club is a club to which a large number of Russians went. I should say some of them were respectable; there are many clubs in the East End where it is not etiquette to ask the name of a fellow member. It depends upon circumstances whether we leave a woman at liberty to watch if men who are wanted come and see her.

               <p>were watching for, amongst others, Peter the Painter. The reward of Â£500 was first published, for information as to Peter the Painter, Fritz Svaars, and a woman, as far as I remember, on December 22. Peter the Painter, Fritz Svaars, and Luba Millstein were then living at 59, Grove Street. Svaars died at Sidney Street, Millstein was liberated, and I have heard that Trassjonski since her release has been sent to an asylum. To my knowledge it was not reported that Peter the Painter went to Paris shortly after these occurrences. The last place we heard of him was in the east end of London.</p>

                  </hi>, seam presser, 47, Broomhead Street, E. I am in the employ of Mr. Solooski, of 20, Spital Square, I knew the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street. Eight months ago I first met Fritz Svaars there. I play the balalaika. After I got to know him he called upon me, and I called upon him at 59, Grove Street, where Trassjonsky lived with him. Peter the Painter lived in the front room. I recognise Dubof, Peters, and Rosen, whom I knew as "The Barber." I first met Dubof when he came to my lodgings at Broomhead Street; Fritz introduced him to me; he said, "He is a painter." I first met Peters at the club, and I have seen Rosen at 59, Grove Street. Fritz told me he was a barber. The first time I met Josef was on December 16, at Grove Street. I knew Gardstein. On December 16 I saw Fritz had a pistol similar to Exhibit 66, and bullets for it; this was at Grove Street. A fortnight before he came to my lodgings and showed mo a Browning pistol similar to Exhibit 2. At 12.45 p.m. on December 16 I went to 59, Grove Street; I used to go there every day. I learnt Fritz to play the mandolin. In the large room in the front I saw 12 people, amongst whom were Peter the Painter, Fritz, Rosen, Josef, Federof, Millstein, Marx, Gardstein, and Hoffman. Peter and Rosen played chess, Marx and Fritz made up paint, and Josef, Federof, Dubof, and myself stood by the bed. I stayed there an hour. I do not remember what was spoken about. I then left. Nobody went before I did. I left the mandolin behind me, and I went back the next day to get it, as I wanted to go to Shepherd's Bush to Dubof on the Sunday to play it. The police arrested me when I got there.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. Englishmen go to the club as well as Russians. I have not seen any recreation hall there, but there is a concert-room; there is also a refreshment-room, and a library. When I saw Peters there there was a concert going on. I am not an anarchist. On</p>

               <p>December 16, at Grove Street, I saw no picture painted by Dubof. Dubof said that he knew of a factory where he would ask for work for me. I saw absolutely nothing suspicious there. It might have been one or two o'clock when I got there. Gardstein, Federof, and Josef arrived after I did. I should not like to deny that Dubof came after two o'clock. The police took from me a pocket-book in which were Peters' and Dubof's names and addresses. I never told them that Peters was Svaars' cousin.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. I have only seen Rosen once at Grove Street. He resembles Fritz; I always thought they were brothers. Fritz did not tell me that Rosen played the mandolin.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I do not know if Peter the Painter was a political malcontent. I did not notice if Trassjonsky and Millstein opened the door and immediately withdrew.</p>

                  </hi>, interpreter, Thames Police Court. I was present at Bishopsgate Police Station when, on December 24, Federof, Peters, and Dubof were charged with, amongst other things, conspiracy to break and enter 119, Houndsditch. I interpreted the charge, Federof acting as spokesman, said, "We deny all knowledge and we are not guilty"; the others repeated the words. Two days previously I went with police officers to 48, Turner Street, where Peters was. Acting on instructions, I said to him, "These persons are police officers making inquiries about the Houndsditch murder." He said, "I do not care; I cannot help what my cousin Fritz has done. I know nothing at all about it." On the way to Old Jewry he said, "I expected this every day. If the police want to know what happened that Friday night, they may call my landlord's attention that on that particular evening I was engaged in mending or setting a mousetrap. After I left work I went to a provision shop facing Turner Street, bought food here, brought it home, and never went out again. I went to bed about 12 o'clock." At the police station I cautioned him, he having said that he was quite willing to answer all the questions that were put to him. He made a statement which I interpreted and In<lb/>spector Collinson wrote down. (The statement was read.)</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. He gave us every information quite freely. He was detained for inquiry on December 22, and I was careful to explain to him that he was not under arrest. Something was mentioned about</p>

               <p>a dead man being found in Fritz's room. I know that he handed some officer some cards of membership of different societies, but I cannot remember to whom.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. The titles of these books are as follows: "History of the Revolutionary Movement in Russia." "On Revolution and on Revolutionary Government," "A Tale About an Unrighteous Czar," "The Government: Its Role in History," "Positive Science," etc.; they are all revolutionary books.

               <p>To Mr. Melville. He was charged on the 24th. He showed me cards of membership of various societies to which he belonged, one of which is "Rules of the Shoreditch Social Democratic Working Men's Club and Institute." I found that he had been working regularly since the previous July; I did not go back further than that. He was working from eight to eight, and he never missed a day up to the time of his arrest.</p>

I told him who I was and said, "I am making inquiries regarding the Houndsditch murders." Mrs. Petter, his landlady, who was present, spoke his language and English. There was then some conversation between her and Dubof in his own tongue. She spoke to me in English, and I had written a portion of the statement down when I said that he had better come to the Old Jewry Police Station. He said, "You make a mistake; I will go with you." At the station he made a further statement in broken English, I having cautioned him first. I wrote it down at the end of what I had taken down from Mrs. Petter. Exhibit 68 is the statement which he signed. (The statement was read.) On February 2 I went to Wells Street, Hackney, a hairdresser's shop, where I saw Rosen. I told him who I was, and he said, "I know you have come to arrest me." I said, "I want you to accompany me to the City as I have reason to believe that you can give me some important information respecting the Houndsditch murders." He replied, "I will come with you." I took him to Old Jewry where he was cautioned. A statement was</p>

(These state<lb/>ments were read. He stated therein that the statement he had pre-viously made was false, and that as to Vassileva two or three days after the Houndsditch affair he called on her without any special object, and discovered her washing her hair; that she asked him if he had brought trouble with him and he said he did not know; that he asked her what was the matter with her head as her hair was not all one colour, and that she said that she was the woman who had been living at Exchange Buildings, and he understood her to say that she had dyed her hair but as it was not good she was washing it out again; that she asked him not to go there again as he might bring trouble; that she told him she took and lived in a room in Exchange Buildings but that she left when all the men went in, by which he understood her to mean that she left there when they went in to commit the crime; and that he then left after having remained there 15 minutes.)</p>

                  </persName>, recalled. When I went to Dubof's lodgings on December 22 I told him I was making inquiries about the Houndsditch murders. I should hardly say he was in custody then. He then made part of the statement (Exhibit 68). That part was translated by his landlady. He was then taken to the police station and kept under detention; I should not say that he was at that time under arrest; if he had attempted to leave no doubt be would have been stopped. Dubof told me that on December 10 he had sent money to his sister in Russia; when searched we found on him the Money Order produced, for Â£1 1s. 6d.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bryan. Rosen's first statement was made on February 2; he speaks broken English; I think he understood all that was said to him. Before arresting him I had made inquiries about him. I showed his photograph to (among others) Mr. Greenberg; he would know that I was making inquiries about Rosen in connection with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250125"/>
               <p>Houndsditch murders, but I should not tell him that Rosen's arrest was contemplated. Rosen did not say, "Have you come to arrest me"; he said, "I know you have come to arrest me." I showed his photograph also to Miss Campbell, to whom he was then engaged, and whom he has since married. When I called upon her she voluntarily gave me Rosen's address. I have made inquiries about Rosen's past history.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. On February 7 about 8.15 p.m. I went with another officer and with Richardson to Sidney Street. In Buross Street I saw Vassileva with Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Gordon. I went up to Vassi<lb/>leva and told her we were police officers and were going to arrest her on suspicion of being concerned in the Houndsditch murders. She appeared to understand what I said; she made no reply. Afterwards I went to 11, Buross Street, and there found a bundle of newspapers, Exhibit 91; some clothing, including Exhibit 92, a woman's three<lb/>quarter length blue jacket. On February 9 Vassileva was at Bishops<lb/>gate Police Station, and I had a conversation with her, which was interpreted by Mr. Timotheiff. I told her that she had been identified as the woman who had been living at Exchange Buildings during the fortnight preceding the murders; she said, "I did not live there." I told her that the witnesses alleged that she was seen taking down the shutters there; she said, "I do not know the place." I told her she had been identified as the woman who was with Gardstein, Dubof, and Peters in Cutler Street immediately after the murders. She said, "I do not know the names." I told her it was about 11.30 p.m. on December 16. She said, "I was not there: I was at home." She was then charged with conspiracy to break and enter and steal the goods of Mr. Harris, and with being an accessory after the fact to the murder of Tucker by Gardstein. Her reply was, "I do not know either of those persons or either of those places; it is a false accusation; who accuses me! it is all lies." At this time I did not know anything about the muff afterwards found at 11, Buross Street. It was on February 14 that Levy gave his evidence in regard to Vassileva. When she was arrested her hair was much darker than it is now.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. As to the muff and stole, if they were in Vassi<lb/>leva's room on December 18 I think I should have found them. The Gordons have relatives living in Sidney Square; I do not know that Vassileva had been watched continuously from December 18 till the time of her arrest. In some of the newspapers in the bundle, Exhibit 91, Peter the Painter is mentioned. I do not suggest that there is no such person as Peter the Painter. It was supposed that he had come from Paris two months before these events, and it was rumoured that he had gone back there.</p>

In the room on the first floor of No. 11 Exchange Buildings there was a double bed sufficient for two to sleep on; there was a palliasse and two feather pillows, and a table cloth on the bed; there were no sheets or blankets; the bed-quilt was on the table downstairs.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. The absence of proper bedclothes is a common incident with the wretchedly poor people in the East End.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. On the paper handed to me is the name of a firm of London shipping agents doing business with Russia. I have inquired, and found that on November 19 a receipt was given to that firm by P. Morrin for Â£31 12s. That money had come by telegraph order from Russia. The photograph of Gardstein was taken to the firm, and there is no doubt that Gardstein was Morrin. Of course, the actions and movements of Gardstein from November 1 were of im<lb/>portance. I do not think this information was given to the Treasury or to the solicitor for the defence. I have conscientiously produced everything that could tell either for or against the prisoners; I have kept nothing back so far as I am aware.</p>
               <p>This closed the case for the prosecution.</p>
               <p>Mr. Melville, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Stewart submitted that there was no case to go to the jury as against their respective clients.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grantham held that with regard to each of the accused the case must go to the jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodkin said that he quite appreciated there was a distinction in point of evidence, or quantum of evidence, between the case of Dubof and that of Peters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grantham said he would take care to point out the difference to the jury, but he thought the proper course would be to let the whole case go to the jury.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I was born in 1886 in Brinken<lb/>skia, Courland, Russia. Up to 1905 I was employed as grocer's assis<lb/>tant in Libau; I then worked as a dock labourer and in a butter fac<lb/>tory. I became an active member of the Lettish Social Democratic Party, and for about seven years undertook propaganda work in the Army and among the working classes, unpaid; I was brought before a court-martial in Riga, detained for 18 months and acquitted on September 1, 1908. I was still engaged in propaganda work and heard that the police were going to visit me in connection with articles I had</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250127"/>
               <p>written in a democratic paper, so I went to Germany, intending to go to the United States, but had not sufficient money. I saved some money, went to join a comrade in. Denmark, and not getting work there, came to London in October, 1909, and lived with my cousin, Fritz Svaars, at 29, Great Garden Street, Whitechapel. Many Russian refugees lived there. I found Fritz had changed in character and I removed to another address, which I have forgotten. On January 26, 1910, I went to learn to be a tailor's presser, working for Muller, 1, Cobbold Road, Mile End, living at Cook Street, Commercial Road. Having learned the trade I worked for Kannenbaum; in July, 1910, went to work for Landau, 2, Steward Street, Spitalfields, and re<lb/>mained with him in constant work up to the date of my arrest. I went under the name of Kolmin because I was known by name as the secretary of the Lettish Social Democratic Federation and a member of the Working Men's Federated Union, which has branches all over the world, and employers would object to employ me. I was lodging at 236, Brick Lane and afterwards moved to 48, Turner Street, where I was arrested. At my lodgings I always gave my own name. From November, 1910, I attended the London County Council Evening School to learn English. The first night I went to my new lodgings in Turner StreetâNovember 25âI went to a concert at 107, Charlotte Street and adept with a friend, a Mr. Gordon, who lives in the first street on the left-hand side of New Road; I forget the name. Till about 11 p.m. on December 10 I was at the Albert Hall at an Inter<lb/>national Anti-War Meeting, returning to my lodgings at one a.m. I had told my housekeeper (I forget his name) not to bolt the door so that I should be able to get in with my key. As regards the other evenings, I used to come home regularly from work, and when I was not at the Russian Library at 106, Commercial Road or at the evening school, I used to read at home. On December 16 I went out, as usual, just after seven a.m. and I finished work at 7.30 p.m. I waited for an hour for my wages, as the girls and the Jews were paid first. I think Mr. Landau and the two managers were present, as they gene<lb/>rally were, when I was paid. On my way home I went to a provision shop facing Turner Street, where I bought some food. I arrived home about nine p.m. I saw my landlord three times that evening. He was going out when I went in. I sat down and read. After a little time I opened the door to him. On the third occasion I saw him he brought in a mousetrap; I believe it was that very evening that I had told the missus about the mice getting at my food and she said she would see to it. We prepared the mousetrap. I then continued reading and went to bed at about 12âmy usual time. I got up the next morning at my usual time, and from then I continued working as usual until December 22, when, on returning to my lodgings, I was arrested. I told the police officers I knew nothing of the affair and that I believed that one of the people must be my cousin, because I heard that a dead man was found at his lodgings. I was then taken to the photographer to look for Fritz's photo. On the following day Dubof and I were taken in a cab to Bishopsgate Police Station, where we were placed in a room. (Mr. Bodkin stated that he would not object to this</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250128"/>
               <p>evidence, provided he was allowed to call Chief-inspector Hayes and Detective-inspector John Collison, to whom he had understood counsel for the prisoners had stated that they did not desire to put questions. Mr. Melville said he would not carry it further.) The first time I saw Dubof was at the police station. After Fritz and I separated in Great Garden Street I saw him in the street, but I never spoke to him. We never visited each other as we did not know where each other lived. I have been to 59, Grove Street twice, once at the end of November, and again shortly afterwards. I might have seen Gardstein, but per<lb/>sonally I never knew him. It was Fritz I went to see at Grove Street, as I had a letter from my sister telling me that his mother was very anxious to know about him. Apart from my wages at Mr. Landau's, which was 24s. a week, I had no other money. I do not know where Exchange Buildings is; I have never been there. I was in no way concerned with the conspiracy to break into Harris's shop; the first I knew of it was when a Lettish girl, who worked at my place, was arrested on the Monday. I have never been in a public-house in England. Federof, Dubof, and I never went out together. I only knew Federof once when he visited me at my lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Leach. I never saw Vassileva at 59, Grove Street. As far as I know, Peter the Painter was never a member of the Social Democratic Party of the Russian Refugees. He may have been a member of the English Association, but I cannot say. I saw him once at Fritz's lodgings.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. I am 24 years of age and 5 ft. 6 in. in height. Sometimes I have spots on my face and sometimes not. My moustache was like it is now all the time I was working at Landau's. In winter I wore a coat with a velvet collar. On work<lb/>ing days I wore a cap and on Sundays a green trilby hat; I have never worn a bowler hat. I was a shop assistant in Russia and then I worked in the docks for a month. I left the shop in 1905 in order to propagate for the Social Democratic Party amongst working men; our theory is not that the proceeds of everybody's work should be shared but that everybody should be paid for his labour. Fritz called himself an anarchist, but he did not know anything about it; I did not say in my statement to the police that he had committed a robbery at a Government wine shop: I said he had done damage there; I was not correctly interpreted. The society of which I am secretary is composed of Letts only. Hoffman is a Lett but he is not a member. Millstein and Trassjonsky and Federof are not Letts. I do not know Josef. I possibly may have met Marx, but I do not know him. Russians have not such a name as Marx. Exhibit 76 is a photo of Gardstein. I think I have seen him at 29, Great Garden Street; he lived with Fritz; but they did not live there when I was living there. I do not know him. I have not seen this man (Exhibit 144, Marx). In this group (Exhibit 114) there is a man similar to Peter the Painter, but he had no beard; he lived with Fritz. I do not know the name of my landlord at 28, Turner Street; I took no interest in him; I spoke to him very little. I did not notice his name when he was called at the police court. I told him on the first night</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250129"/>
               <p>I was at his house, November 25, that I was going to a concert and ball, but I do not remember whether I told him where it was going to be. I do not know Toynbee Hall. I asked him on that night not to bolt the door; that and the night of December 10 are the only times I have done so. I first heard of the Houndsditch shooting on the Saturday night, I think. I did not speak to my landlady, Bluma Abrahams, about it. I remember Philip Abrahams saying at the police court on March 5 that his wife could not come and give evidence; I think he said it was because she was not well. It may be that he said she had gone out shopping that very morning, but the shop is only just opposite. Before I was identified each time I stood in the row where I pleased as I was told I might do so. I was not asked afterwards whether I had any complaint to make as to the manner in which my identification had been conducted. It was not three o'clock in the morning when we arrived in a cab; there were plenty of people in the street and on the pavement, but I did not notice who they were. There were also plenty of people in the passageâmen and women. I do complain about my identification; our clothes were dirty, our hair uncombed, our faces unwashed, and we had no clean collars, and everybody could recognise the place where we had come from. There were two classes of people, one dressed very nicely and the other dressed ordinarily with handkerchiefs round their necks. I had nothing round my neck. The half day that I missed work at Landau's was August Bank Holiday, but I do not remember the other half day in August; I was ill-that afternoon. I did not get my full money. I do not know whether a time-sheet was kept at Landau's; there is a manager there who would know whether I was at work or not. For overtime we got paid the same day; if we missed half a day it would be deducted at the end of the week. I was known as "Kolnin" there. At the L.C.C. school I gave my name as Peters; I cannot help it if the people there spelt it as "Pitter." When working for my party in Russia my name was "Svornoff."</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I have never seen Peter the Painter. I was never at the Jubilee Street Club.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. In Russia when you work among the party it is well known you have many names. I never bought any asbestos from a man named Craigie.</p>

                  </hi>, 48, Turner Street, E. Last Monday my wife had a baby and she is unable to come here. Peters lodged at my house for a month before December 22, occupying the front room on the ground floor. I occupied the back room. He went out about 7.30 a.m. and returned at 8.30 p.m. The first night that he came and took lodgings, November 25, he said he would be sleeping out; he did not ask me to do anything about the door. Generally when he came home he used to read the papers; sometimes he went out, but he was always in before 11. On one night he told me not to bolt the door as he would be out late. On the night of December 16 I left the house at 10.5 p.m., leav<lb/>ing him reading. He had gone to work that morning as usual at 7.30 a.m. and returned between 8.30 and 9 p.m. I was going to the Christmas Club when he came home, and I saw him again on returning home.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. I remember I said at the police court on March 15 that my wife was just about to be confined and could not come and give evidence, and I remember saying that she had been out that day and the day before. I know she made a state<lb/>ment to the police on December 23, and what she said. I did not talk to her about where Peters was on the 16th. I first heard of the Houns-ditch murders on Sunday, December 18, I think. I talked about it to Peters on the Sunday, but not after that date. After his arrest I and my wife talked together about the time he came home on the night of the 16th. My wife is up and goes about the room, but she is very weak. She went out very seldom before the baby was born. She could not come and give evidence on March 15. It is true that she went out shopping on that day, but the shop is just opposite. She told me on the 23rd that Peters came home about 8.30 or 9 p.m. on December 16. I remember December 16 because I withdrew money from the Christmas Club; I only do that once a year. I produce a notice saying that money will be shared out on the 16th. I have thrown away the book where it says I withdrew the money. On November 25 Peters said he was going to a club; I believe he said Toynbee Hall. I left the door un<lb/>bolted for him then, and he came in at 2 a.m., but I never heard him. He came home the night that he said he was going to a concert and ball; he never told me that he slept with a friend. I do not know that he went to the Albert Hall on December 10; I do not know what time he came in that night. I always bolt the door. I spent the night of December 16 in a public house with Koblinski.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. My wife has been in an asylum, and I had some anxiety during the period she has been passing through.</p>

                  </persName>, manager, Landau and Sons, wholesale tailors, 1 and 2, Stewart Street, Spitalfields. Peters had been employed by my firm as a presser since the middle of July last, his hours being from 8 a.m. to 1, and from 2 to 7.30, and on Saturdays from 8 to 2. He</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250131"/>
               <p>has missed two afternoons from the time of his entering our employ until he was arrested on December 22. This wages book (Exhibit 138) bears that out; he missed one half-day in the week ending August 19, and he missed again in August. We found him a very good workman.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. The list of money at the side shows that he missed in the week ending the 19th. I see that there is the same money, too, for two weeks before. It may be later on; I have not examined the book carefully. The book is not of much importance; the wages are entered in it only to carry over into the cash book. It may be that Peters's name is in it for three weeks after he was arrested, and it is possible that money that he should have received was put against his name on two of those weeks because there is nobody there to inform the lady clerk that he was not in. It is generally entered up on the following Monday. I do not keep any time-sheets. If workmen miss in the afternoon they bring it down to the following Friday; a Miss Marks, another young lady, does that. She is not here. I cannot say that I have any pieces of paper from which Peters's times were entered in December.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Overtime is paid on the same night. This is the best evidence I can produce as to the wages paid to the men. We employ 80 or 90 men, and we regard this book as an efficient test as to the attendance of the men.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). My proper name is Zurka Laiyyn; I am a political refugee from Russia; for that reason I changed my name. I am 24 years of age, and the son of a small farmer; and I worked on the farm till I was 18 years of age and then I went to Riga to learn the painting trade; I stayed in Riga till the autumn of 1905 and then returned to the farm. I was a member of the Lettish Social and Dramatic Working Organisation; I was arrested in connection with this agitation and was punished with nagiakas, or Cossacks' whips. I came to this country in June, 1907, and stayed at 505, Commercial Road; I only stayed in London four days and then went to America; I stayed there a fortnight and then went to New Jersey; I came back to England in April, 1909. On that occasion I went to live with my brother in Whitechapel. In June, 1909, I went back to Riga; I returned to England again in January, 1910, and went to live at 72, Wellesley Street, Steney. I found work on this occa<lb/>sion and met Beckov at work; the work came to an end, and I went to Switzerland and returned again on September 20. I went to live at 20, Galloway Road, Shepherd's Bush, where I lived till my arrest. At this time I was working for Messrs. Turpin, 17, Berners Street, as a painter on a job at the Savoy Hotel; my landlord, Mr. Petter, and Beckov were working on the same job; I worked there all days of the week including Sundays; that job came to an end on October 19.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250132"/>
               <p>I was next employed on regular work at the Dieudonne Hotel about November 15 or 16; after finishing at the Savoy, and before I. started at the Dieudonne, I assisted my landlord painted signboards. I finished at the Dieudonne on December 12 with Beckov as we had no work to do. On Saturday, December 10, I was working at the Duidonne till one o'clock; after leaving work I went to a post-office and remitted one guinea to my sister in Russia; then Beckov and I went to have dinner; after dinner we went to the British Museum; we went to Tottenham Court Road station, and there we separated. I got home after four; I remained at home that evening; Beckov came home about nine, and remained at home the rest of the evening. I remained at home on the evening of Monday, 12th; I remember Mr. and Mrs. Schaffer and Mr. Scheurig calling that evening. The next day Beckov and I went to the Millwall Docks on a Russian steamer to see Tchukst, the cook, on board the steamer Irkutsk; all three of us went to a public-house near by; we left Tchukst at 11 o'clock. I left Beckov in the afternoon and went to 59, Grove Street; I went there to meet Peter the Painter with regard to painting some decora<lb/>tions at a balalaika performance which they were going to give. I left Grove Street some time after five and went back to Millwall Docks and saw Tchukst; I left him at about 10; I had had a good bit to drink and my head was aching, so I went back to Grove Street and stayed there all night. I got to Shepherd's Bush the next morning about nine; I did not go out at all that day, I was painting pictures; I slept at home that night. On the Thursday I was painting the picture produced (Exhibit 55); I did not go out that day; on the Friday I was engaged in finishing this picture and sticking it on that board; I had dinner at home that day. I went out about quarter to two and went to Grove Street to see Peter the Painter with regard to the decoration work, and also with regard to some other work; Peter the Painter had told me that he would have some other painting work, to paint a certain house. When I arrived at Grove Street I found there Luba Millstein, Fritz, Peter the Painter, Rosen, Hoff<lb/>man, Federof, Josef, and Marx; I stayed till four o'clock; I was not in the house all the time; I went with Millstein to help her carry some linen to the laundry; I was out for about seven minutes. After I left Grove Street I went home and did not go out again that evening; I went to bed about half-past 11. I have never been in Exchange Buildings; I have never been in "The Three Nuns" public-house with Gardstein; or at Aldgate with Federof and Peters; I have never been in Cutler Street with Vassileva. I know Hoffman, and have been to his rooms; I have never seen Gardstein there. The time-sheets produced bear my signature; I make the time-sheet up, and it is countersigned by the foreman. I have never seen Richardson to my knowledge till I saw him at the police-court proceedings. I have never had a gold watch or pawned one; the black watch produced is my watch; the pawn-ticket signed "C. Somerfold" is not in my hand<lb/>writing. I did not know of any conspiracy to break into Harris's shop. I first knew I was wanted in connection with the Houndsditch</p>

               <p>murders through the newspapers on December 21 or 22; I was going to take some work on the 23rd, but Petter told me I had better stop at home as the police looking out for me might go to the place where I was working.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. I know the East End of London pretty well. I gave a statement in English to the police officer, but he did not understand me and I did not understand him. I became acquainted with Fritz about two years ago; he came to where I was lodging to visit a man named Alprosit; I have met him from time to time since, but not very often. When I was arrested Mrs. Petter acted as interpreter; I did not say through Mrs. Petter that I had never been to Grove Street; I said I had been to Grove Street; I did not mention the names of Frits and Peter the Painter; I saw the inspector writing something down as Mrs. Petter was interpreting. I made another statement at Old Jewry; I said then I did know Fritz and Peter the Painter; the game inspector took down what I said; he did not understand me and I did not understand him; I asked three times for an interpreter but I was not given one. It is not true that I only went to Grove Street once before and then could not get in. To-day is the first time I have ever said that I slept the night of the 13th at Grove Street in Peter the Painter's room. On Friday, 16th, I went out with Luba Millstein to the laundry at about quarter past three; if Luba Millstein says she went to the laundry-at half past one she is mistaken; it is not true that we parted at the laundry and she got back about two o'clock, or that Dubof returned shortly after her; he came before her. The laundry is in Commercial Road; I do not know Whitechapel; I do not know Laymans', the pawnbrokers in Whitechapel Road; I do not know how long it would take from the laundry to Whitechapel Road. After I left the laundry I went to a place near Grove Street to get some cigarettes and then went straight back to Grove Street. I know Trassjonsky; I cannot explain how that pawnticket came to No. 10, Settles Street, where she was living. On December 16 I was in the back room at Grove Street with her, Hoffman, Rosen, and Federof having tea; Gardstein was there that afternoon; I met him in a club in Jubilee Street two years ago; I do not know who he is or. what he is; I have seen him about twice since I returned from Switzer<lb/>land; I cannot say how long he stopped there for. I know Newcastle Place; I have seen Fritz there two or three times. I do not know that the furniture from Newcastle Place went to Grove Street; I did not notice it when I slept there that night. I know Mr. Woolf Braun; it is not true that he has seen Fritz, Gardstein, Rosen, and myself at his house together; I have not seen Gardstein at that house at all; I have seen Luba Millstein at other times but not together. I have known Vassileva for about a year and two months; she used to live in the same street as I did, Wellesley Street; I knew her in Buross Street; I have been there two or three times to buy cigarettes. I have had this suit of clothes two years; it is from Russia. It is not true that I was in Exchange Buildings on the Sunday before the 16th.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250134"/>
               <p>I do not know whether Fritz, Vassileva, or Trassjonsky have been to Exchange Buildings. I do not know Peters; I may have seen him a year ago at the Russian Library; I did not know he was a cousin of Fritz. On December 11 I did not work; I stopped at home; it was Sunday; I worked on Monday, 12th; I did not work on Tuesday, 13th. Mr. Scheurig used to come to the Petter's house twice a week and the Schaffers as well. I know Beckov, we were not great friends; we worked together. I know Shepherd's Bush a little; I know Uxbridge Road; I do not know if there is a large colony of foreigners there; I do not read an English newspaper; there is a shop in Uxbridge where foreign newspapers are sold, but Russian newspapers cannot be obtained there. I can speak a little German but cannot read German; I have never bought any newspapers. I do not know Houndsditch. When I was out of work from October 19 to November 15 I was in the neighbourhood of Shepherd's Bush; I never went out only to buy tobacco. I do not recognise the bag produced; I do not carry a bag in England only when I go from one station to another. I have known Rosen for more than a year; I did not go about with him at all. I have been in the street once with Fritz but not with any of the others. None of the time-sheets produced of the Dieudonne are in my hand<lb/>writing; some of the writing on the time-sheets of the Savoy job is in my writing; the words "Shepherd's Bush" is my writing; the "s" in Shepherd's Bush and the "s" in Somerfold on the pawn<lb/>ticket is similar to mine, but I did not write it; I have never pawned anything in England except a guitar. The gold watch (produced) is not mine, I have never seen it before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stewart. I have seen Vassileva in two different placesâWellesley Street and Buross Street. I made her acquaintance by constantly buying cigarettes off her. Pearlman was the landlord at Wellesley Street. I recognise in this group produced to me the photographs of old Mr. Pearlman, Miss Pearlman, and Gard-stein, whom I knew as Morountzeff. Written on the back of it is "To dear Nina from the 'wicked' Fenia." Miss Pearlman was called "Fenia." In Russia it is dangerous for it to be known that you are in communication with political refugees. The speeches at the Jubilee Street Club were mostly on astronomy and other things. I never heard Peter the Painter make a speech there. I do not know any<lb/>body who used to visit the club. I cannot say if Vassileva was a girl who was very much distressed concerning the position of poor people in Russia; I did not speak to her much. I do not know that the Pearl<lb/>man's lived at one time in Great Garden Street. The club is called "The Working Men's Club," and it is also called "The Anarchists' Club." Fritz had a suit which was similar to mine, and I think Peter the Painter also wore a brown tweed suit with broad dark stripes, which I do not think were more visible than those in mine.</p>
               <p>Further cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. I lived at the Pearlman's house in Wellesley Street for over a month. Gardstein, Dubof, Hoff<lb/>man, Rosen, and Vassileva did not frequent the house. I have seen Gardstein twice only at the club, and later on at Grove Street. I was living with the Pearlman's at the time I met Gardstein at the club.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250135"/>
               <p>I did not meet Peters at the Pearlman's; Vassileva lived there; Rosen visited the landlord there twice; Masha and Millstein did not come there.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. It is not true that when the police officer came he said, "I am a police officer, and am making inquiries about the Houndsditch murders"; at the time he came I was in the kitchen and he was talking to the landlady. The landlady then had a conversation with me. I have only lived in the East End about 3 1/2 months altogether.</p>

                  </hi>, 36, Galloway Road, Shepherd's Bush. I knew Dubof as a lodger at 20, Galloway Road. Between six and 6.30 p.m. on December 10 I went there with Scheurig to see Mrs. Petter. I saw her, her husband, and Dubof. My wife was not with us. We stayed till about 11.30 p.m. Dubof did not go out while I was there. Beckov came in about nine. We all had supper when my wife and Mrs. Petter returned from shopping. Dubof was there when we left. On the following day, Sunday, I had a visit from a friend named Gertz at Woolwich and I did not go round to the Petter's; I do not remember what sort of day it was. On the next evening Scheurig and I were working late and we did not get home till nine p.m. We went round to the Petters' about 9.30. We saw the Petters and Dubof. It was on the Sunday after this that Mancini called upon me.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. Scheurig is in the same electrical company as I. For the last eight weeks I have been calling at the Petters' house four or five times a week in company with my wife; I was not calling frequently in December. The reason why these evenings are impressed on my memory is that I was working late nearly every evening for a Mr. Zobodski, giving him a hand with his business, and I was very seldom round at the Petters' as I had not got time. The reason I can fix the 10th particularly is that on the 22nd or 23rd Inspector Newell called on me and asked me what I knew about Dubof, and I could fix the date by going back. Mr. and Mrs. Scheu<lb/>rig, Newell and I talked the matter over. If I went round to the Petters' on December 11, it was only for a few minutes, but I was not there to my knowledge. I am giving the times of day I went to the Petters' entirely from memory.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Newell told me he had come about the Hounsditch murders and that caused me to think of all the times I had seen Dubof.</p>

                  </hi>, wife of last witness, corroborated her husband's evidence as to seeing Dubof at the Petters' house on the evening of December 10, and added: At 8.30 a.m. on December 16, I went round to the Petters' house for breakfast, and there saw Mrs. Petter, Dubof, and I think, Beckov. I left and went there again at 11 a.m., and gave her the key to my house so that she should look after my baby, whom I had left alone in the house while I was going to the school to see my children. I came back to her at about dinner-time, 12 o'clock, to fetch the key, and I saw Dubof. I remember him asking Mrs. Petter for some white paint.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250136"/>
               <p>Cross-examined. When I returned to Mrs. Petter for the key, I stayed about 10 minutes. I do not think I saw her again that day. I see her nearly every day; we are only a few doors apart. For more than six months I have been intimate with her. On December 11 there was a party at the Petters', to which my husband and I, Mansigny Dubof and, I think, Beckov went. I left before my husband.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. When calling on the Petters I saw Dubof a lot of fstimes.</p>

Between 11 and 12 a.m. on Friday, December 16, I called and Mrs. Petters told me to go into the kitchen. I there saw Dubof smoking a pipe; I had seen him about three times before. The next day for calling, Mon<lb/>day, I called and saw him again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I have been calling regularly for 12 months past. I remember it was the 16th that I saw him, because it was on that night that the outrage happened.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. That was the first time I had seen him for several weeks. A few days after I saw in the papers that he was one of the men who were arrested.</p>

                  </hi>, 18, Galloway Road. Since the February of last year I have known Dubof. On the night of December 16, at about 7.30 to 8, I was standing at my door when Mrs. Petter opened her door with the key, and as the door opened I saw Dubof going up<lb/>stairs. I said "Good evening." Mrs. Petters remarked what a windy night it was. Two or three days after I heard he had been arrested. My house is next door to the Petters' house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. In these houses you can open the front door with your foot on the bottom stair. I was standing at my gate, which is about four or five feet from the door, and as Mrs. Petter opened her door wide I could see through it. I am sure it was Dubof, because he turned round as I said "Good evening"; he did not answer because he does not speak English very well.</p>

We had dinner, and then I went to buy some bottles of beer. Petter's dog followed me, and after I had got the beer I went to Petter's door, and knocked. Beckov opened the door and I let the dog in. I saw Dubof and Petter wash<lb/>ing in the scullery. I saw him again on the 18th, but not after that. I first learnt that he was arrested on the Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. I must have seen him washing several times. The dog always follows me in the street. I often went to the Petters' house, but I never went before seven or eight.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I have not knocked at the door at that time other nights. I do not bring the dog home in this way very often.</p>

                  </hi>, painter, 20, Galloway Road. In the early part of 1910 Dubof worked with me at the same firm; he was introduced me as Bechov. Beckov and Dubof worked with me on a job at Claridge's Hotel for three or four weeks. He went away to Switzerland and came back in September; he was then on a job with me at the Savoy Hotel up to October 19. He came to live with me at 20, Galloway Road, sharing Beckov's room. After the finish of the Savoy job I carried on private work on my own; Dubof gave me a hand on November 10, 11, and 12. He did signboards at home for me. From November 15 till December 12, Dubof, Beckov and I were working regularly on a job at the Dieudonne Hotel. We nearly always left home together, and came home together. On December 12 Dubof was discharged because the plasterers were not ready for the painting work to be gone on with. I continued on, and when I got home at night I always used to find Dubof at home. On December 10, a Saturday, I came home by myself at one o'clock, midday; Dubof and Beckov went off somewhere together. Dubof came back at four or five. Later on Mr. and Mrs. Schaffer and Mr. Scheurig came, and the whole lot of us were together until late that night. On December 11 Dubof did not go out at all; it was foggy weather; Mr. Mancini came about dinner-time and stayed till II. I remember the night of December 16. I met Dubof about 8 or 8.15. That day I went to Chiswick to fetch an overcoat from my tailor's. I produce my tailor's account with that date marked on it. I got home at a quarter past eight, and found there Dubof and Beckov and my wife. The Schaffers and Mr. and Mrs. Scheurig came in. We all had supper; Dubof was at home the whole of that night. On December 17, I think, Dubof went out in the afternoon. On Monday the 19th I went to work as usual; coming home, I saw the name of "Zurka" on the placards, and something about the Houndsditch affair. Always calling Dubof "Zurka," I was surprised, and I bought a paper. When I got home I told Dubof about it, and he asked me to read the paper to him. He was to have gone to work again at the Dieudonne on the 20th; we talked it over, and decided that in case the police might want him he should stay at home. He wanted to go himself to the police. I noticed no difference in Dubof after the murders Between September 26 and October 19, on the Savoy job, he would be working 10 hours a day or moreâsometimes very late at night, and on Sundays. I do not think he would have had any chance to go down to the East End. The same thing applies to the period between November 15 and Decem<lb/>ber 12.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. I never heard Dubof mention the names of Fritz, Gardstein, Rosen, Morountzeff, Vassileva, Millstein, or Trassjonsky; I do not know that he knew anybody at 59, Grove Street. His usual language with me was Russian; he cannot speak much English.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250138"/>
               <p>Re-examined. I only remember Dubof staying out all night on December 3, his birthday, and on the 13th.</p>

                  </hi>, hat manufacturer, 44, Spencer Street, Goswell Road, confirmed Petter's statement as to the party on December 11; the witness saw Dubof at the Petters' the whole of that evening.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi rend="smallCaps">PETTER</hi> corroborated her husband's evidence. She said that on December 15 Dubof was at home painting the picture (Exhibit 55). On the 16th he was in his room and about the house all the morning; after dinner, about two o'clock, he went out, saying he was going to take his picture to a friend; he came back between six and half past, and did not go out again. The witness had seen Dubof with a black watch, never with a gold watch; she had never seen him with a revolver or cartridges.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. We keep pretty regular hours. One day is very much like another; the visits of the Schaffers and the Scheurigs to our house are pretty frequent. When Dubof stayed away on the night of December 13 he told me he had slept with a friend; he did not say where. In my statement to Inspector Newell I am taken down as saying, "On Saturdays after returning home from work, he washed and dressed himself, and went out usually from five to seven, and on several Saturdays he did not come home all night." This is a mistake. He only stayed out twice whilst he was at our house. On the occasion of Dubof's arrest on the 22nd I translated between him and Inspector Newell; Dubof said, "I have never been to 59, Grove Street; neither do I know Fritz or Peter the Painter."</p>

                  </hi>, 6, North Place, Buxton Street. I was charged at the Guildhall with Fritz, Petters, Rosen, Vassileva, Hoffman, and Federof, and I was acquitted; I was then called as a witness for the defence. In December I was living at 59, Grove Street. On the 13th, I think, Dubof' slept there in the front room with Peter the Painter. He was then drunk. On December 16 Dubof, Rosen, and Hoffman came to the house. Dubof had with him Exhibit 55. Tocmakoff, Fritz, and Peter the Painter were there. In the afternoon they were playing chess and music. I had to go out with some washing; I told Fritz I could not carry it; he asked Dubof to assist me, and Dubof and I went to the laundry together. I had to wait at the laundry, and Dubof left me there. When I got back to No. 59 Dubof was there; I cannot remember what time he left. Later that night Trassjonsky and I went to see some living pictures. On re<lb/>turning she and I were staying in the back room; Fritz and Trass<lb/>jonsky lived there together. About midnight I heard two people coming upstairs. On my going to the front room door and knocking Fritz told me I must not come in. A little later the men left and I went with Trassjonsky into the front room and there saw the body of Gardstein lying on the bed. I heard a conversation between Fritz and Trossjonsky. Fritz told her that Morountzeff was wounded</p>

               <p>and asked her to put cold water to his side. Shortly afterwards I went to Hoffman's room in Lindley Street. Fritz and Federof and Peters were there. I heard Fritz say that he carried Gardstein like a baby; also that he wanted to leave him near Commercial Road, but he started screaming. I saw a revolver in Federof's hand; I had seen no other revolvers that night.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Stewart. I have known Vassileva for some time; she used to go to the club in Jubilee Street; Peter the Painter used to go to the club, and there were political speeches there. I never saw Peter the Painter with firearms. (Shown the photograph (Exhibit 103a) of the girl Masha.) I never spoke to her; but I have seen her at the club; I have seen her wearing a collar and muff and scarf similar to these produced. Peter the Painter had a key to 59, Grove Street. Besides Fritz, Marx, Federof, and Morountzeff I saw no one else come to the house on the night of the 16th.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. I have been seeing Vassileva for about two years; I never saw her in company with Peter the Painter and I never had any conversation with her. At one time I lived at Newcastle Place with Fritz; Dubof came there a little; Rosen used to come often; Gardstein and Hoffman also called there; I have seen Vassileva in conversation with Fritz; Dubof used to call a little at 59, Grove Street, after eight o'clock at night; I think he came to see Fritz, also Peter the Painter. Trassjonsky never went out with any of the men who came to 59, Grove Street; so far as I know she did not know Vassileva. When I went out with the washing I think it was about two o'clock; in my evidence at the police court I said I thought about 1.30 that I went out and that I got back about two. I am sure I saw him in the house before I went to the laundry; he was in the room with Rosen, Hoffman, Fritz, Peter the Painter, Tocmakoff, Marx, and Josef. In my statement to Inspector Thompson I said it was about 12.30 that I first went into the back room where Dubof was with the others; so that Dubof would be there an hour or so before he and I went out. Before December 16 I had never seen a pistol or dagger in the place. I know that on the 17th, when the police came, they found a quantity of cartridges, iron bars, and so on in the room. I cannot say how they came there. I remember Marx about three o'clock that afternoon bringing in a long narrow packet done up in paper; I should think Dubof was there then. At the end of July Fritz and I became bad friends, and he left me; in a fortnight he came back; he then had several watches; Gardstein gave him another watch; Exhibit 155 is the watch Gardstein gave Fritz. Fritz gave me a watch which I let him have back to pawn; that was shortly before December 16. If the watch was found in Vassileva's possession I cannot explain how it got there. As to the pawnticket being found upon Trassjonsky, Trassjonsky told me that Gardstein gave her the ticket when he was lying wounded. Rosen usually came to 59, Grove Street, in the evening.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Leach. It was after our quarrel that Fritz gave me this watch; I never saw Vassileva wearing this watch.</p>

                  </hi>, job foreman, Turpin and Company, 17, Berner's Street, W. Dubof was employed by my firm at work on the Savoy Hotel in the autumn of last year. I produce his time-sheets (Exhibit 140) for that job from September 26 to October 19. They are made out by him and countersigned by me and I send them to the office. I make out separate time-sheets myself to check his. We start work at 7 a.m. and I have to see that all the men come in and if he comes late to book him late. There is an hour's interval for dinner. He left work at 6 p.m. Exhibit 140 shows that he worked 15 hours on October 1 and 16 hours on October 2 and on the following Saturday and Sunday we worked 15 hours each day. The second half of Exhibit 140 are the time-sheets made out by him for the Dieudonne job and show that from November 15 to December 12 he was con<lb/>tinuuously at work except Sundays and that he left work at 1 p.m. on Saturdays. Exhibit 141 are the time-sheets I made out myself for that job, and neither Exhibit 140 nor Exhibit 141 show that he was absent at any time. We found him a steady, good workman. We asked for him on December 18, but found he had been arrested. He left work on December 12 because we had to wait for the drying time up of the premises; the work was behind time.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. The only three Sundays he worked were October 2, 9, and 16. It is true that the time-sheets only give the number of hours he has worked and not the times he started and left off work, but I was there to see the men did not arrive late or leave work before the proper time. They never worked all night although there may have been a few hours' overtime. If a man worked at night he would not come on so early in the morning; he would be booked in next day and might make his 10 hours up although he did not begin at seven. The 15 1/2 hours on the Wednesday does imply that he started work at seven.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. The ordinary time is 10 hours a day. If a man works overtime he is paid according to the time; he is paid time and quarter from six to eight and so on; so he really works less time than appears on the time-sheets. It is my duty to see that the men come and leave at the proper time. Dubof always attended regularly.</p>

                  </hi> (prisoner, on oath). I understand English a bit, but not much. I am a hairdresser and reside at 112 Well Street, Hackney; I was born at Riga; I am 26 years old, and my father's name was Tzelin. I came to this country in January, 1909, adopted the name of "Rosen," and entered the employment of a hairdresser named Strosch at High Street, Poplar. I was there about 10 months. I then went to live at 29, Great Garden Street, where I stayed about two weeks. I then went to 27, Dockhead, Bermondsey, where I entered the employ of Weinberg, a hairdresser. I remained there until about August last year. Whilst working there I returned several times to my lodgings at Great Garden Street, where I was friendly with the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250141"/>
               <p>family. I became acquainted in this way with Fritz, Hoffman, and Peters. Fritz is no relation of mine, and I bad never seen him before I saw him there for the last time just after Christmas, 1909; I next saw him last summer in Hoffman's room at 36, Lindley Street; I sometimes visited him after that at 35 (or 39), Newcastle Place, and also at 59, Grove Street. I visited Hoffman at Lindley Street also, when I used to see him in company with Fritz, Wolff, Braun, and many others; I have seen Fritz there two or three times; he used to play the mandolin, which I also could play. I think he is an actor, I have seen him sing at the Union Club. I knew him to be a kind man; I did not know that he was engaged in criminal practices. After leaving Dockhead in August, 1910, I went to manage a barber's shop for Weinberg, who had bought another business at 112, Well Street, Hackney; I took all the receipts; the shop was not in very good order, and I went there to work it up. For about four months a boy was working with me; I do not know his address; he left about six or eight weeks before Christmas. The premises consist of the shop and a small room at the back in which I slept. From the time I went there until I was arrested I never slept anywhere else. Weinberg sold the business to Wilcin on December 5, and on December 12 Wilcin came to live there. In the first week in December I was living there alone, with a boy to help in the evenings. I was never out as early as 8 a.m. because I was working late; I was never in Houndsditch during that week, or in any week as early as 8 a.m. I opened the shop at 8 a.m. every day. Between 10 and 11 a.m. on December 5, Wilcin came and stayed till dinner time, when he went out for an hour or so. He then came back and stayed till I closed the shop. The rent collector also called between 11 and 12 a.m. I did not leave the shop at all that day; I sent to a coffee shop for my food. I do not think I was out any evening that week except Thursday. I usually went out on Thursday evenings, because I closed my shop at 2 p.m. and went to see Miss Campbell, who is now my wife. I was with her this evening until about 11 p.m., and I then came home. On December 12 I opened the shop at the usual time and closed at 9.30 p.m. I did not go out at all that day. The rent collector came in the morning, and then just after dinner came an old man from Weinberg's son to fetich his bed away. Between 4 and 5 p.m. Wilcin came. I was not in Houndsditch at all that day; I have never seen the place. I never saw Dubof or any of the other people on that day. I did not go out at all on the following day, the 13th. In the afternoon Janson came with two other men, and about 5 p.m. Wilcin came there to stay; he slept in the same room as me, and continued to do so from that day. I did not go out at all on the day he came, neither did I go out the following day, the 14th, because on that day I stopped in bed nearly all day because I was not feeling very well. Wilcin was there all that day. On the next day, the 15th, I felt still queer and did not work. I did not leave the house; I got up about 1 or 2 p.m. In the evening I went to see Miss Campbell; I married her two days before I was arrested. Whilst with her I met none of the people said</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250142"/>
               <p>to be concerned in this affair. I left her shortly before 11 p.m. and went home. I did not leave home again that night. Just after 1 p.m. on the following day, the 16th, I went out and met Hoffman in Com<lb/>mercial Road, and, in consequence of something he said, I went to 59, Grove Street, arriving there about 2 p.m.; Hoffman said he was going to see Fritz, and as I knew Fritz also I went with him. I saw there Fritz, Peter the Painter, Millstein, and Trassjonsky. As far as I know the others arrived afterwards. I am not sure about Tocmakoff. I played chess with Peter the Painter. There was no discussion in my presence about a robbery at Exchange Buildings; I never heard such talk in Fritz's room. I left about 4 or 5 p.m. and went with Hoffman to a picture show in Whitechapel Road; Hoffman is the man I refer to in my statement as "Masais." I left him at his door in Lindley Street at about 9.30 and went home. I did not go out again that evening except to go across the road to a fish shop to get some food I slept as usual with Wilcin. I did not know that anybody contem<lb/>plated committing a robbery that night. I have never been in Exchange Buildings, and do not know where they are. I have never worn a cap in England. I have never carried a bag in Houndsditch, and I have not see the two bags (produced) before these proceedings. I made two statements to Inspector Newell, the second of which was true. I have never walked with Gardstein or Vassileva in the street, and I have never gone with Gard<lb/>stein or Dubof to see her in Buross Street, although I have been several times with Hoffman. I did not go to see anybody especially. Fritz was a fellow-countryman of mine, and in the autumn I used to visit him at Newcastle Place, sometimes once a week and sometimes not for two weeks. When he left there to go to 59, Grove Street I saw him four or five times there. I never agreed with him or anyone else to commit a robbery. I have never been a member of any Anar<lb/>chist club, but I went two or three times to the Jubilee Street Club the first year I was in England; I have never been since. In Russia I was a member of the Social Democratic Party, but since I have been in England I have belonged to no such party. I know Sanson. He has made a statement to me about his absence. Greenberg had pro<lb/>mised to be present at my marriage, but he was not there.</p>
               <p>Gross-examined by Mr. Melville. I have never while in Hoffman's rooms seen Gardstein and Dubof together. My first statement was made, I believe, two days after my arrest; I was for six days at the police station and I was questioned every evening; I answered and then came the statement. I was defended by nobody at that time. I know Dubof came to 59, Grove Street on December 16 after I had arrived; I arrived at two p.m.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Leach. Hoffman was friendly with the landlord of 59, Grove Street and used to call often. I heard Bessie Jacobs state at the police court that she had seen Vassileva take down the shutters at 11, Exchange Buildings. Trassjonsky then exclaimed, "I am the woman, not her." I never saw Peter the Painter at the Jubilee Street Club).</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250143"/>
               <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Bodkin. I cannot see the smallest resem<lb/>blance between Vassileva and Trassjonsky. I remember Police-con<lb/>stable Woodward looking after me at Bishopsgate Police Station on February 6 and having a talk with him. I did not say to him, "If I know something and do not tell them, what will they do with me?"; I do not think he understood me very well. His account of the conver<lb/>sation we had is not very correct; I did not tell him that I could show where a man and woman who were concerned in it lived. On Feb<lb/>ruary 2 I made an untrue statement as to not having known Fritz and then I made the true statement to Inspector Ottaway two days before I had this conversation with Woodward, and what I really asked was if it meant something bad for me because I had made an untrue state<lb/>ment at first. The reason why I said that I did not know Fritz, Peter the Painter, Peters, Federof, and all the rest was because I knew those persons were committed with the Houndsditch murders, and I did not like to be committed with them; I did not want to be implicated in their affair. It was not a surprise to me to be arrested, because I had been told that Inspector Newell was at various places looking for me. I thought if I said I knew nothing of these people perhaps he would not keep me at the station; I had been married only two days before and I was thinking about my living. I first met Dubof at 74, Wel<lb/>lesley Street on about March 10. I think I saw him once at Wolf Brown's. I was at Brown's house several times, because Hoffman, whom I am very friendly with, lived there. I was also friendly with Brown and I used to go and play chess with him. Hoffman was called at the police court. I used to see him in his room at Brown's in com<lb/>pany with Fritz, Gardstein, but not Dubof. I never had a little brown bag. The reason I went to Vassileva on December 18 was that I had found Hoffman out and I thought he might have gone round there. I did not understand her when she asked me if I had brought trouble with me and I said, "I do not know." I did not ask her what she had been doing in Exchange Buildings on her telling me she had been there. It was about half an hour after I arrived at 59, Grove Street on the 16th that Dubof came; that was the first time I had seen him that day.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled, further cross-examined by Mr. Stewart. Bifstek was a sailor living at 11, High Street, Poplar, where I once lived. I afterwards met him with his landlord's daughter (Miss Pearl<lb/>man). At his invitation I visited him at 29, Great Garden Street, where Fritz and Peters were living. Old Mr. Pearlman moved to 74 or 76, Great Garden Street. I know Hoffman as "Maises" and Gard-atein as "Buika." After a time Hoffman left Wellesley Street and went to 36, Lindley Street. I did not know anything against Hoffman. Peter the Painter was sometimes at that address; he was friends with Fritz. I cannot say Peter the Painter had plenty of money; he was well dressed; he had the appearance of being better off than the rest of us. I also saw Gardstein at 36, Lindley Street. I have never seen.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250144"/>
               <p>Vassileva at 59, Grove Street; I made her acquaintance at 29, Great Garden Street, and believe I saw her at 74, Wellesley Street, where Vassileva afterwards went to. She came sometimes into the landlord's room, and I learnt from him that she was his lodger and made cigar<lb/>ettes; I bought some from her before the murders, but not after. I knew from the papers that Gardstein had been shot on December 16. I cannot say whether Gardstein and Vassileva were great friends.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. I knew on February 2 that my arrest was contem<lb/>plated, because I heard that Inspector Newell was asking for my photograph and wanted me for the Houndsditch murders. I told Newell everything I knew about these people. I was a frequent visitor at Hoffman's lodgings and there saw Woolf, Fritz, and Peter the Painter. I saw Vassileva at Buross Street on the Sunday after the murder. I have never been to Cutler Street, Middlesex Street, or Stoney Lane.</p>

I saw him there on Monday, 5th, at nine in the morning and half-past seven at night. Rosen worked for me till February 2. He did not go out on he evening of December 13 or the next day. On the 15th he went out after the shop was closed. On the day of the murders he went out between twelve and one and returned about ten o'clock: he did not go out again; we went to bed at 12 o'clock. I have never seen him with a cap.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bodkin. I cannot remember when I first heard about the finding of Gardstein's body; I never spoke to Rosen about it. I read in the papers about the murders; I cannot remember whether I read it to Rosen. On February 7 I made a statement to Inspector McLean, in which I said that I read an account of the murders to Rosen and as he did not appear to understand it I explained it to him. He said he did not know the photo of Gardstein. Rosen asked me where Grove Street was; I showed it to him on a map. He said he did not know any of the people in custody. I do not know what Rosen did at nights at Well Street prior to my living there; he was in sole charge. Exhibit 161 has my signature on it; when I made that state<lb/>ment I was under the impression that Rosen never left the shop on the 16th, but I remembered afterwards that he was out. Rosen and I discussed the Hounsditch crimes: he never said he knew any of the persons mentioned in the paper.</p>

               <p>To Mr. Stewart. The watch has been in the possession of the police since February 7 and was at the police court ready to be produced. I believe the Treasury knew it was in the possession of the police. The watch was not produced when Millstein was giving evidence.</p>

                  </hi>, recalled. About six o'clock on December 23 I received instructions to prepare for an identification at the Bishops-gate police station I arranged to use the chief inspector's room. The witnesses arrived between-a quarter to seven and a quarter past. Chief-inspector Hayes was the officer on duty. Peters and Dubof arrived between half past seven and a quarter to eight. It was arranged that they should come through New Street and Rose Alley, so that they should not be seen by any of the witnesses. I took no part in bringing any of the men in who stood in the row; that was done by other officers.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. I do not know who the officers were. I do not know that Peters has been asked whether it was three o'clock in the morning. I was in the muster room when prisoners came in. I took no part in the identification. There were no other people in the cor<lb/>ridor when they came through.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I do not remember Isaac Gordon saying at the Guildhall, "On the Monday Vassileva asked him to go to a particular friend of hers, a doctor, and ask him if he could let her stop at his house." I did not speak to the prisoners at the police station on the 23rd.</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="191104250146"/>
               <p>Re-examined. It was arranged that the prisoners should be brought to the station at dusk, owing to the people about the station and to avoid the witnesses seeing them.</p>

                  </persName>, City Police. On Decem<lb/>ber 23 the witnesses arrived in batches from a quarter or twenty minutes to seven to a quarter past; Dubof and Peters were brought in some time later. Entry 592 in the charge-book was made under my direction and it records the timeâ8 p.m.âas the time when the prisoners came. Several officers were sent to get men in from the street to stand up far identification; all the men brought in were not accepted. I told the prisoners they were to be identified and to place themselves anywhere they liked in the row, which they did; after each identification they were asked if they wished to change their positions; they did so. Each witness was brought from my room into the office; then there was another door which was shut; then they came through another door which was shut; they were then told to examine the rank, and, after examining, those who iden<lb/>tified were sent to one part of the station, those who did not to another. At the end the prisoners said they were satisfied with the identification.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. Police-constable Piper is the officer who nearly identified Dubof. He was the only officer in the room where the wit<lb/>nesses waited prior to seeing prisoners. It is not usual to prevent witnesses talking together before they go in to identify. The instruc<lb/>tions to the officers were to get some men to stand in a room for wit<lb/>nesses to identify. I do not know if Woolf Braun was one of the people. I do not know if Isaac Levy and Craigie swore there were only five foreigners in the rowâtwo besides Peters, Dubof, and Federof. I did not hear Peters say that he made a complaint. I cannot say whether the prisoners were brought there unwashed and unshaven. I do not think there was a description of the men wanted on the station. The witnesses were warned by officers to come to the station. There were five or six officers in the room at the time of the identification.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Stewart. I was not in charge when Isaac Levy purported to identify the girl as the girl with Gardstein on the 16th.</p>

On December 29 a number of persons were got from the street and placed in the yard at the back of the Guildhall Police Court, among whom Peters and Dubof were put. The men were selected for their resemblance to prisoners. Mr. Robert Humphreys, solicitor, and a gentleman from the Russian Consulate were present. The prisoners were asked after the identification if they were satisfied with the fairness of it, and they said they had no complaint. Mr. Humphreys and the Russian gentle<lb/>man also expressed themselves satisfied.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. No doubt I saw sketches and descriptions of prisoners in the papers. I do not know if there were any foreigners in the row at the Guildhall.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Bodkin. Mr. Humphreys told me he represented all the prisoners at the direction of the Russian Consul.</p>

                  </persName>, recalled. I was at Bishopsgate Police Station, when Federof, Peters, and Dubof were brought to be identified. I was there as a witness.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Melville. I knew yesterday that there was a question as to the identification of these people. The witnesses were in the room about a quarter to seven and the examination was not over till nine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stewart, on behalf of Vassileva, called only a witness to cha<lb/>racter, <persName id="t19110425-name-515" type="witnessName">

                  </persName>, manager to Messrs. Millhoff, who said that Vassileva had worked for the company and her character was very good. Her average earnings were 25s. a week.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bodkin asked for a ruling as to the order of speeches. He submitted that if a counsel representing a defendant as to whom no witnesses are called puts any questions and elicits facts from witnesses called by other defendants, he makes those witnesses his witnesses; putting those questions, not in cross-examination, but for the purpose of eliciting facts from witnesses called for the other defendants, is in fact the giving of evidence on behalf of the person he is representing. Further, the rule had been followed on many, many occasions, especially in charges of conspiracy, that where the cases of different defendants are intimately involved the Crown has a general right of reply. Mr. Bodkin contended that the questions put by Vaasileva's counsel to Peters, Dubof, Millstein, and Rosen were in the nature of eliciting facts on Vassileva's behalf.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stewart said he was unaware of any case that had been taken to the C.C.C.R. or the C. Cr. App. in which Mr. Bodkin's proposition had been main<lb/>tained. If counsel for one prisoner finds in the witness-box witnesses, called either by the prosecution or by other prisoners, who give evidence concerning his client, it would be a monstrous hardship and a reversal of well-established practice to say that, because counsel availed himself of the opportunity to cross-examine those witnesses, he should be deprived of the last word, to obtain which (or largely so) that counsel had refrained from calling evidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Justice Grantham said that as a matter of strict law he was of opinion that Mr. Bodkin was right in his submission. Unquestionably Mr. Stewart had made these witnesses his witnesses; in the course of cross-examining them he had repeatedly stated, "I must get out these facts for my clients." Strictly, therefore, the Crown was entitled to the last word. But in a case of this gravity his Lordship did not wish it to he said that anything had been done having even the semblance of injustice to the prisoners, and, under the circum<lb/>stances, the usual course must be followed where one counsel did not call wit<lb/>nesses and others did, namely, that he had the right to wind up, and counsel for the Crown must speak before him.</p>
               <p>Accordingly the order of addresses to the jury was: Mr. Melville, for Dubof and Peters; Mr. Bryan, for Rosen; Mr. Bodkin, for the Crown; Mr. Stewart, for Vassileva.</p>
