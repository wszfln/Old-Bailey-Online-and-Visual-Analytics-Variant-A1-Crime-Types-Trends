Mr. William Gardiner, of No. 4, Paradise-row, Stoke Newington, doth hereby agree to sell, and Mr. William Rowe, of No. 10, Cambridge-road, Mile-end, builder, to purchase, for the sum of 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the lease (of which there is about seven years unexpired) of all that brick-bulk sugar-house, with the ground and appurtenances there to belonging, situste and being on the south side of Wellclose-square, Ratcliff-highway, in the said county of Middlesex, and adjoining on the south side there of to another sugar-house, not belonging to the said William Gardiner; and also all the fixtures, articles, materials, and things now being in, upon, or about the said sugar-house, hereby agreed to be sold, and whether forming part there of or not. The ground-rent payable by the said lease, to be paid and cleared up by the said William Gardiner to the time of completing the purchase, and so objection is to be made by the said William Rowe to the title, on account of any breach of the lessee's of assignee's covenants in the said lease, not the lessor's title required, nor any abstract of the title of the said William Gar<lb/>diner</p>

               <p>required to be furnished, it being expressly understood by and between both the said parties that the delivery of the original lease, and such other documents as are in the possession of the said William Gardiner, by him to the said William Rowe, shall be deemed as showing a good title to the said sugar-house. Five ponds now paid as a deposit, and the residue of the purchase-money, to be paid on the 23rd August now instant. when Mr. Gardiner is to execute to the said William Rowe an assignment of the said lease, to be prepared by Mr. William James Adams, at Mr. Rowe's expense; Mr. Rowe, in addition, to pay any district surveyor, or any paro<lb/>chial authorities, fees heretofore payable, or any expense incurred in shoring up the said sugar-house, and indemnify Mr. Gardiner therefrom.

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What are you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I am out of business—I do nothing for my living—I am a man of small fortune—I live on my property—I have said this assignment was sold by auction—I do not know whether I said that I bought it by auction—James Adams who prepared the agreement is assistant to an attorney as a conveyancer—he lives in Devon<lb/>shire-street Mile End-road—he is a housekeeper—I commissioned him to find somebody to buy this property of me—there was no hoard round it—there were no posts up preparatory to it—I never heard that the parish had complained of it as being dangerous—there had been a strut against it—it would not have been on the ground <hi rend="italic">but for that</hi>—quite different—I do not know who put the strut up—the premised were shut up from 1844, when I became possessed of them till 1847—I gave 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them to the trustees under the will of George Witty—there were a great many fixtures in the sugar-house when I bought it—I sold some of them—I do not know howmuch—I have not got my 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. back again—I spent a great deal more thanthat—I have not laid out much on it—I have not employed people to gut it—I did not take the fixtures out; they are there now—I took some part out—I took out some clay-rails—I do not know whether that was all that was taken, I was not there—I sent a lad to take some—one pipe was taken out for an alteration—we were going to repair the house for a sugar-refiners—I do not recollect when that was, it was in 1845—that was one single iron pipe—it is in reserve for the freeholder—I believe the person who had to mend the windows has the pipe now—I did not give him the pipe for mending the win<lb/>dows—the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184710250008"/>
               <p>pipe does not belong to him, he brought it away among some clay-racks—nothing else was brought away that I know of—I did not take the iron railings out, nor cause them to be taken out—I never tried to get a man into the house to sell them to him for wrought iron, nor did he tell me it would not do, it was all cast—I did not take any man in—I did not take the iron to a man instead if taking a man to the iron—no such thing—I never said I should have cleared the place of all the iron if it had been wrought iron, but it would not do as it was cast—I never sold the premises to pull down, certainly not—I do not know whether I told Rowe that the fixtures were worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will you tell me what the meaning of these words are in this agree<lb/>ment? "All the fixtures, articles, materials, and things, now being in, upon, or about, the said sugar-house, are hereby agreed to be sold, whether forming part thereof or not." <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That means the counting-house fixtures—I believe I met Wilson, Rowe, Robinson, and a man named Matthews, at the Devonshire Arms to talk this matter over—Robinson and Matthews were to go to look at the premises—I have a carpenter named Carter, I do not call him a foreman—I am out of business—I am not a carpenter—Carter is a jobbing carpenter—I referred the parties to Carter who had the key of the premises to show them—when we all met at the Devonshire Arms I went to Carter's—he had not the key then; he might have mislaid it—he wrenched of the" padlock and hasp in my presence—I ordered him to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was not the object of your meeting at the Devonshire Arms to enable these people to ascertain whether that portion that could be pulled down was sufficient to pay them their 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., whether they could get for their the 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. what you had for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you state that you bought the whole of the interior at a sale by auction, that the fixtures were yours, and that you purchased them to prevent the place being pulled to pieces? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I said nothing about pulling down—I said I bought the fixtures—I did not say that I purchased the whole of the is<lb/>interior at a sale by auction, certainly not—here is the catalogue under which I bought (<hi rend="italic">producing one</hi>)—I did not say that I had not made up my mind whe<lb/>ther I would pull it down or not, but I had since concluded to have it pulled down and sell the materials—Robinson remarked that the sugar-house was of no use except for the purpose of pulling down, and I told him that could not be—I did not say there was nothing to hinder my doing so, and that Adams, my legal adviser, had stated that he had been a whole day perusing the deeds which were a yard high—I said I had not got the deeds then—Adams never saw the deeds—I did not add that there was nothing to prevent them pulling them down, as I had never been asked for ground-rent since I had been is the place—I had not been asked for ground-rent; I had not paid any—I took an assignment of a leasehold interest on which ground-rent was payable, and had not paid any—I do not know that I said that I had not been asked for ground-rent, and that it was not likely I should, as the only claimant to it was an old woman, and she had lived on the Continent many years—I said it be<lb/>longed to an elderly lady, and I believed she was abroad—I believe Robinson said when he went into the building, "Where are the fixtures that you said were worth 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. out of the 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.?"—I did not say in answer to that, "Look at the iron columns, and about a thousand feet of York pavement"—I said the iron doors—I do not recollect saying anything about the York paving—I will not swear I did not—I did not say, "Look at the lead on the roof"—I did not point to the back building and say. "Why that will fetch 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I did not add. "What I should do would be to pull down that part of the building first"—I never heard one of the person say, "Why the wall cannot be all</p>

               <p>taken down, because of the adjoining dwelling-houses, which are only two stories high—I know nothing of it—I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "Never mind, get the top and roof off first, and if you are obstructed, state you are going to take off four stories, and then repair and make it into an eight-roomed dwelling-house with a side door, as the building is now in a dangerous state and must be taken down?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It is all fiction, I never said so—on coming down the parties might go to wash their hands at a man's who keeps a ginger-beer shop—I went—I do not know whether they all went—I did not, while I was there, say, "There was a sugar-house on that spot, and the parish authorities have pulled it down, and I suppose they will do so with this if I don't, and sell the materials to pay the expenses"—I think Robinson did ask who had been at the expense of shoring up the building, and I said I did not know—I do not recollect the ginger-beer man saying he believed the parish authorities had done it—I do not recollect that I said "Yes"—I cannot positively swear that I did not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did Robinson say, "That would be about 15<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I must not forget to make that an item in my calculation of what the place is worth?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say that he did or did not—I did not hear Matthews say he would call on Mr. Fuller, the agent of the sugar-house, to know whether he or the parish shored it up—I will not swear about it—I do not recollect saying, "Don't do that; if there is any demur about the expense of shoring up, in case you should be called upon to pay, I will repay you"—I cannot remem<lb/>ber anything about it—I did not say to Matthews, "In case you or Robin<lb/>son have the place you may commence pulling down the back building to-morrow"—certainly not—I do not recollect saying, in answer to the sug<lb/>gestion of Matthews. that he thought he should build an eight-roomed house with a side entrance, "I think yours is a very good idea, you,' will be the man that shall have it, but don't say anything about it while Robinson is here, as he wants it"—I did not see Rowe on the 10th—on the 11th I signed the agreement at the Devonshire Arms, with the conveyancer—I did not think of having a stamp put on it—it was afterwards stolen away—I was paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on account—I said, when I received the 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., "You don't want possession yet?"—I do not recollect saying, "You don't want possession yet for a day or two?"—Rowe said "No"—I swear I did not see Rowe every day at the Devonshire Arms, from the 10th till the 17th—I will not swear that I only saw him that once, I cannot say—I do not recollect his meeting me and inquiring after the assignment—I did not say, "It is not done, but it shall be done; it is all right; you know what to do"—on the 17th I did not ask for a little more money—he paid me 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more on the 17th, from the lead he sold on the premises—I understood so—I believe they had just removed the lead—they robbed the premises to pay me the money—he did not ask for the assignment again—I did not say it was not ready, but "You know what to do, you can go on without it."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you say, "You will want a good many horses and carts to cart away the materials; I have got a tenant of the name of Saunders, residing at Hackney; I shall be glad if you will give him a job?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Rowe had never seen the sugar-house at that time—I said I had a carter close by where he was building houses at Stoke Newington, that had some horses lying idle and I could recommend him, but that was quite a different business—Rowe told me he was building house for Wilson at Stoke Newington—I do not recollect Rowe saying, "I have been digging for that pipe you told me of, but I can't find it"—I did not say, "You will be sure to find it there"—Rowe never said anything of the sort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you said they were all to go to the Old Bailey, did Mr. Wilson</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184710250010"/>
               <p>say, "Don't frighten the men, take me, I will take a hod of bricks and carry them;" and did he take a hod of bricks, and carry them in your presence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was in the street; he took them to the cart, but I did not hear him say anything about that.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Fuller, of Billiter-street—he is agent to Messrs.

I accompanied Mr. Gardiner there—I saw Wilson and several men in the act of taking away the bricks, pulling down the premises, and taking away the materials from the building, and there were some carts outside—the principle part of the rafters, purloins, and principals were gone—I saw some of them taken away in one of the carts—Wilson was there directing the men to go on with the business—the whole of the roof was off on the 25th, and they were loading the girders and bricks—there were some window-sashes on the carts—I went with Mr. William White<lb/>more on the 25th, and told the men if they did not leave off taking down the building they would be indicted for felony, and they stopped till the afternoon—they then went on again and were given into custody—when I went with Mr. Gardiner, Wilson said he should take it down till he had got his money again that he had paid—I went again between half-past three and four o'clock, and Wilson went in again to the men, and said, "Go on"—that was after he was given into custody—I was with Mr. Whitty, in 1844, when Mr. Gardiner came into possession of the premises—I did not draw up the list of fixtures, but there was one drawn up—this is it—a portion of the fixtures were sold to Mr. Gardiner; not all of them—the list contained none of the free hold fixtures—the joists and purloins, and things of that sort, belong to the freehold—they are not in the list of things sold to Mr. Gardiner—he bought some fixtures, and he of course would have a right to remove them, and sell them—amongst others there were clay-racks, and iron doors, and so on, but none of the joists and purloins, and girders are in the list—the amount of the materials which have been taken from the premises, not belonging to Mr. Gardiner, but to the freehold, are worth, as old materials, at least 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it would take at least 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to restore the damage done to the premises—the value of the remainder of the house, as it now stands, is about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I have known the premises a long time, and have inspected them frequently—they were not in a dangerous state—they did not require instant pulling down to save the lives of Her Majesty' subjects—on the 21st of Sept. I went with Kelly, a policeman, to Wilson's house, and found, on a piece of land adjoin<lb/>ing his house, three king-posts and four tie-beams—they were articles from the premises in Wellclose-square.</p>

               <p>to complete the purchase—I told him to bring it back, and he promised to do so—he never returned the agreement to me—nothing whatever was said as to immediate possession, and nothing whatever was said about taking up the flooring and pulling, down the house—I was not authorized by Mr. Gardiner to give up the agreement—I did it on my own account, knowing they had bought the property.</p>

On Monday, the 9th of Aug., I was at the Devonshire Arms—the proposition was made to meet at twelve o'clock, it was afterwards altered to one—I saw Mr. Gardiner there, and a person named Carter, a carpenter—two strangers afterwards joined us near the Dog-row, the prisoners Rowe was one, I do not recollect the other—we went together to the sugar-house in Wellclose-square—it was fastened—there was a padlock to it, but no key—Mr. Gardiner called on Mr. Carter to take his hammer and screwdriver, and one thing or another, and force the hasp off, which was the first thing he did—we went into the sugar-house, and I was very much sur<lb/>prised to see the place so empty—I said to Mr. Gardiner that I was very much surprised to find place so empty to what it had been represented—Mr. Gardiner had told me it was the whole interior of a sugar-house, and everything there complete—he had offered it me for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and he afterwards said, "I shall want another 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the interior"—I said I could say nothing to it, and when I saw it I was surprised at the emptiness of the place—we went up to the first floor, and I saw nothing but some iron doors and some columns—we went up to the top, seven or eight stories high—I lifted my man up to the top of the roof, on purpose that he might see what lead was there—during that time Rowe came up, and I lifted him up to see, with my foreman—I was not aware that Rowe was buying it at that time—nothing was said about the lead to Gardiner—he went down after they had both got on the roof—I afterwards saw him down stairs—I wanted to see what was down stairs, and he showed me the stone—he said there was 1,000 feet of stone there, which was worth about 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a foot—he parti<lb/>cularly pointed to the back building, and said he should pull the back building down first—he took us over the back building, he showed as the iron columns, and said, "You can shake them: you can take them now"—he said, "What I should do would be to pull the back building down first"—he said there was no obstacle at all about pulling down the back building—I made observation that there was a house adjoining, and I said when we came to that what should we do?—he said, "Take down four stories, and if there is anything wrong you will come to it before you come to the fourth story"—we went to a ginger-beer house to wash our hands—it was there said that a sugar-house on the left hand side had been pulled down, and the ginger-beer man said, "The parish authorities will do by this as they did by the other"—I asked who had been at the expense of doing the shoring—the ginger-beer man said the parish had, and collected 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I told Gardiner it was necessary to make that calculation before I entered into the bargain—we all went to the public-house, and a general conversation took place respecting pulling down the building, and what the weight of iron would be—I was about buying it at that time—that was what I went down for—I told Mr. Gardiner it was of no use to me without it was to pull down—Mr. Gardiner said he had purchased the interior at a sale by auction, of Fuller; and he purchased it to prevent the place being pulled down, as he had not made up his mind; but he had since concluded to have it pulled down—I said I had made up my mind to do so, and said there was nothing to hinder my doing so—he said something about an old lady on the</p>

                  </hi> I am warehouseman to William Cook and others. On the 11th of Oct. the prisoner brought this order for a piece of a silk, re<lb/>sembling the pattern that was enclosed—the order was not a very business like thing, and I had my doubts about its genuineness—I asked if he was known to any party in our establishment—he said, "No"—I then showed him a piece a silk, the nearest we had to this pattern, and asked if he thought it would do—he said if it was the nearest we had he would take it—I took him and the silk to the entering-room, gave the silk to the entering-clerk, and told him, if he thought the order was not right, he was to go to Mr. Cook, and ask his opinion—I stood by the prisoner while the entering-clerk asked him if he was known in the house—he said, "No"—it was then proposed that the silk should be sent over in the evening by our cart—the distance is about a mile and a quarter—the prisoner objected to that, and said he was to take it with him—I took the order to one of the firm, who</p>

                  </hi> I am drayman to Messrs. Truman, Hanbury, and Co., and live in Pelham-street, Mile-end. On Saturday, the 11th of Sept., about half-past four o'clock, I helped Press to load one of my masters' drays—he did not tell me what I was to put on it—I put on four puncheons of porter, a barrel of single ale, a kilderkin of treble ale, and a kilderkin of stout—I did not know who it was for—Press had received the orders—it requires more than two per<lb/>sons to put the casks on—we also put on a barrel of treble old ale, and a barrel of double old ale in addition—the dray was then drawn out to make room for an<lb/>other to come, and Press went over to the office for his delivery-note—I stop<lb/>ped out, loading another dray—Press afterwards told me they wanted another kilderkin of double ale on the dray—he had the delivery-notes in his hand—it was rolled out of the brew-house, and laid in the road—Press helped me to put it on the same dray—we then went into Quaker-street and Brick-lane—we went to Howe's, in Union-street, Kingsland-road, and there delivered four puncheons of porter, a barrel of single ale, a kilderkin of double ale, and a kilderkin of stout—I accompanied Press to get the note signed—Mrs. Howe signed it in my presence, Press then said he had got to go to Cockett's, in Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road, with two barrels, and when he had delivered them I might go home, or stop there which I liked, as he could do without me—he said he had got a kilderkin of ale to deliver somewhere, but did not say where—there was a kinderkin of treble ale on the dray—that was all that was left, except the two barrels for Cockett—we delivered those at Cockett's—I did not see the delivery-ticket for Cockett—I saw the notes signed at Cockett's—there was then only the kilderkin of treble ale on the dray—we turned down into the Hackney-road, and went down Elizabeth-street, to Pratt's house—we there took the kilderkin off the dray, and Press rolled it in—I went after him, close to him—I knew Pratt, and saw him in the bar—Press said, "I have brought you a kilderkin of treble ale"—Pratt said, "That is right"—Press gave him the note—it was doubled up—Pratt went into the parlour</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184710250023"/>
               <p>with it—Press said, "Put 'Shepherd' on the back of the note"—it was put on—I did not say anything—Pratt brought the ticket back from the parlour, doubled up in the same from—I did not see "Shepherd" on the back—Pratt gave it to Press—Press said, "Where will you have the kilderkin?"—it then laid before the bar—Pratt said, "Take it and put it in the passage"—Press told me to pitch it into the passage, and I did so—we came back again, and stood by the bar—Press said, "Go out and see to the horses"—I went out—Press followed me soon after—I had left him in the bar—we got back to the brewhouse after ten o'clock—I told my masters of it on the Monday night.</p>

Truman, in my ordinary employment—I cannot recollect the streets I went up on the Monday, I can those I went up on the Saturday—I knew them when before the Magistrate—I did not know the names of all of them—I have been over them since—I have learned them since—I knew them then, except one—I went the road a day or two after, and saw it—I do not know what I went for—I went alone—I went round the same road that we went with the dray, to see the name of the street—I think Mr. Marr told me to go—Press told Pratt to put "Shepherd" on the back of the note, because that was the regular course of proceeding—of I had been assistant drayman, and had been deli<lb/>vering beer, it would have been proper for me to have my name on the back of the note—I had not delivered at Pratt's before—I knew that he was a customer of my employers—I saw the kilderkin loaded into the cart—I al<lb/>ways remembered that—I do not remember putting it on—there were five or six of us helped to load the dray—I know it was on the dray, but nothing more—I saw it put on, but cannot recollect who rolled it, or who put it on—the quantities that were loaded on the dray were not called out by any one—Lucy, the foreman, gave Press the notes—he had not given him them when Press told me what to put on—I did not hear Press call out, "A kil<lb/>derkin of XXX ale"—the loading takes place seventy or eighty yards form the office—the kilderkins are rolled from the office—there are a great many persons employed, and a great many drays loading in the place sometimes, but sometimes there is not—the men help one another to load—there are not four or five employed on each dray—Conquest and Bright would superintend the other drays—I did not hear what took place at Cockett's—Press and he were down in the cellar together—he did not say anything to me about the kilderkin till after we left Howe's.</p>

Truman's yard—I have been in the employ ten months—the foreman, Thomas Lucy, authorizes the quantity to be removed, and put on the dray—he did not give me direction—he told Press what to take, I suppose—I did not hear him, but it was him that in general did—Lucy gave orders for those drays that he wanted loaded with town beer—there are generally a lot of hands at home—there were three draymen there, and a lot besides—I was one—I</p>

               <p>helped to roll some of the ale over—I did not know I was with Press till after the dray was loaded—before we went to Howe's the dray stopped in Brick-lane, at the corner of Eyre-street—Press went away for about ten minutes there, and left me with the dray—when he returned we went on together.</p>

                  </hi> I one of three storehouse-clerks to Robert Hanbury and other. Pres was in their service as drayman more than eight years, and Shepherd a few months—Pratt has been a customer several years—the porter and ale stores are separate—the drays are mostly loaded where the porter is kept, and the ale is brought there—it is necessary to roll it there from the store, about forty yards—we had at this time two customers, named Howes and Cockett—the two tickets produced would be issued for their beer—they are my writing, taken from our order-book—when orders are to be executed I fill up the tickets and give them to the loading-out foreman, to get loaded ac<lb/>coding to the written notices—these tickets had been filled up that afternoon—we take them to the loading-out foreman, who would direct the quantity of ale necessary to be rolled out of the storehouse to the place where it is to be loaded—they should give directions for a quantity to be put out, conformable to the ticket—a good many drays are loaded one after another—we load from 1000 to upwards of 2000 barrels of beer in the day—I remember filling up these tickets—there was a duplicate to them which the customer signs, and returns by the carman—they are delivered to the carman in one piece—them pieces are what would be signed by the customer and returned to us; the other part is left with the customer—by this order three barrels of ale, and one kil<lb/>derkin of XX ale should have been sent out, no XXX ale at all—I remem<lb/>ber these order being given to Press that day—he brought them to me in the usual way to get marked off, and said "Here are my notes"—that was after he had loaded—I read the orders to him, and marked them off at the same time.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Dose he sign your book that contains an account of what you send out? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he signs the notes, and the customer as well—these are the two parts of the notes that he brought back on the Saturday night after he had been executing these orders—his bringing back the duplicate, signed by the customer admitting the receipt of the goods, ends the transaction—if he did not bring back the note, we should then call on him to account for the what he had done with then-beer—the delivery-not is signed when the beer is supposed to have been delivered—we know where the draymen go, and do not consider further check necessary—he does not give a receipt at starting for the beer under his charge—two men go out with the dray—we should know Shepherd had gone with Press, and we should then find where they had been to—we do not make any memorandum in our books of the drayman's name, as taking</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In consequence of a communication made by Shepherd, on Monday, did you arrange to go over to Pratt's on the Tuesday? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I went on the Tuesday, in consequence of communication made to Mr. Murray—before I went there I was present at a conversation that took place with Press on Tuesday morning—Press was called into the room; one of the Messrs. Hanbury's was present, I said, "This is an awkward matter; what road did you take?"—he said, "By Shoreditch and Kingsland-road"—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a plan</hi>)—I believe this to be a correct plan—he said he came by Great Cam<lb/>bridge-street—this is Hawes's house, and this is Cockett's—the direct way for him to return would be by Great Cambridge-street, Hackney-road—he at first hesitated a little, and I said, "Which way?"—he said he turned to the left in the Hackney-road—I said, "What way did you take then?"—he said Elizabeth-street—I said that was right away from home, half a mile—he said, no it was only a little way, not a mile altogether—I said, "What could induce you to go out of your way, that way?"—he said it was a more convenient road for riding—I said, "That story will not do for me; there were two of you, one to ride and one to drive"—he said it was but a little way, and more convenient—Elizabeth-street would lead to Pratt's house—he denied having been to Pratt's with anybody—he was told my some one that he had taken a kilderkin of ale to Pratt's—I heard him distinctly say he had not been there—Mr. Darnell, Mr. Hanbury, and Mr. Westcott were present—about twelve o'clock on Tuesday I went to Pratt's house, I found him at home, and said there was something awkward with out men, which I was anxious to get at—he said, "What?"—I said, "They have left a cask of ale here"—he said, "There is a cask here; but where it came from, or how it came, I know not"—I said, "It came on Saturday night"—he repeated that he nei<lb/>ther knew how or when it came—I found it in the passage—Mr. Cook, who was with me, said, "Perhaps Mrs. Pratt may remember if you don't"—Mrs. Pratt was called, and asked if she knew how the cask came there—she said, "No," she knew nothing; she left all to her husband—that was in his hearing—I said, "But Mr. Pratt, one of our men gave you a note"—he said, "A note?"—I said, "Yes; a note, which you took into the bar, returned and gave it to him again"—he said, "Oh, but there were two of them;" but he did not know whether it was Saturday, or what day—I have not examined the cask, to see whether it has been tapped—he had plenty of cellar-room to have re<lb/>ceived the cask—it was not with his other casks—I said to him, it was somewhere about half-past eight o'clock on Saturday that they left it—he said he did not know—I said, "Should you know them if you saw them"—he said, "Perhaps I might"—Shepherd was then called in, and Pratt was asked if that was one of them—he said, "Yes; to be sure it is"—he said he told him (meaning Shepherd) to put it there, pointing to the passage where the cask was; but that it being in the way of the barrow, he had turned it</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did not you say, before Mr. Cook proposed going to the cellar, "Perhaps you have no objection to let us take the cask which you have never ordered, and we have never sent?" <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That was after we came up from the cellar, but I think I said so both before and after—I am certain those were the words I said to him—I used the word "cask"—I am not constantly in the habit of making blunders—I have never been fined, or threatened to be fined, by the firm for making any—I will not swear I did not send to Mr. Carne six barrels of 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. ale instead of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., it I did, my written order will show—I will not swear I did not tell Press to load six barrels of 40<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.., and take it to Crane's myself, and get back the 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. ale; if I did I put it in writing in both cases—I swear I did not direct him to dis<lb/>pose of the six barrels of 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. ale that he would receive, among any of the cus<lb/>tomers—I do not believe that I gave him a blank delivery-order for the purpose of delivering it to any other customer—I have no recollection of anything of the sort—I will not swear I did not do so—I do not recollect that Press after<lb/>wards received the ale back, and took it to three places to dispose of, and then came back and told me he could not do so—I will not swear that it did not hap<lb/>pen, but I do not recollect it—I will not swear that Press did not tell me he had done so—I do not recollect that the 36<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. ale was sent out in mistake, and after<lb/>wards brought back and put into store—I will not swear it was not—it has hap<lb/>pened that a quantity of beer other than that which was ordered has been sent, and we have sent to change it, making a memorandum, and giving him a note to leave—I am certainly not free from mistakes, but they are very few—I have never been fined for making mistakes—it has not been the custom of the firm to fine the clerks—if a man receives orders and carelessly disobeys them he is fined—that regulation extends to the drayman—it is generally my business to call out the beer that is to be put on the dray—I called out the beer on this occasion—Press heard me—there is no one else here who heard me—I gave my written orders to Lucy to get loaded—he accordingly got Press's dray loaded, and gave the written orders to Press, who brought them to me—I took them, marked them off, read them to him, and gave him them back—he took the treble ale without any order—a number of casks were standing ready to be loaded—I and another storehouse-clerk were busy just at that time squaring our books for the day, and Lucy called out the beer to be loaded on</p>

               <p>the dray—at the time I read out the notes, Press was ready to go away—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a paper</hi>) this is my writing—it is dated 11th Sept.—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it again</hi>)—it is not my writing, this "11th Sept., 1847" is not mine, I think the "31st Sept., 1847" is—they are not written by the same person—I swear it is not my writing—(<hi rend="italic">looking at three other papers</hi>)—two of these are my writing, the other is either mine or a very good imitation, I would not like to swear which—I do not seem to doubt that it is mine—I never wrote this "11th Sept., 1847"—it is not a mistake for 11th Oct. to my knowledge—I did not in the first instance walk into Pratt's house as a friend, and ask him to let me taste his porter—Cook had been in—I did not send him in—I have sometimes made blunders, but was never threatened to be fined for them—I have not often made blunders, sometimes a whole week will pass over without one, and sometimes a fortnight—I have not been expected after the goods are called over, and loaded in the dray, to see that they are properly loaded—it is not a part of my duty—not to that extent—I am expected to get the orders correctly executed—I give the written orders, and expect the foreman to get them executed—it is not expected of me that I should see every order executed—it is the duty of the foremen to see that the dray contains what is in the written order—if Lucy had done his duty on this occasion, this could not have happened—beer has been several times supplied to pratt's house since this transaction—I cannot say how often—I know that immediately upon this transaction being discovered, we had an order from the counting-house to query Pratt's beer, that is, that we were not to execute any of his orders without instructions from the counting-house—Pratt has been himself to the counting-house and ordered beer, which has been delivered after we made inquiry as to whether we were justified in sending it—I do not know how soon after the order it was sent—I am not sure how many times Pratt has personally ordered beer, several times—I have not been to his house since—I have no idea how much money we have received from Pratt since this—the order-book is in Court—I should not think it was to the extent of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., it may possibly be 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—Mr. Cook stated in my presence that the chalk marks on the barrel showed him when the ale was brewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do not you know that by the blundering of your servants and clerks, beer or ale has been delivered to Pratt which he did not order, and for which you have afterwards received the money from Pratt? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has frequently happened that beer has been sent to customers who have never ordered it, but it has been entered in our books and charged to them—we have many cus<lb/>tomers of one name—we have have two named Pratt—a case occurred just in point in March last, Pratt, of Storey-street, sent to order four puncheons of porter and two barrels of single X ale, the clerk in the storehouse booked the order to Pratt, of Cheshire-street, for whom the note was made out, and to whom it was sent—on the man's reaching there, Pratt told him he had not ordered any, but he should be in want of beer in a day or two, and he might save himself the trouble of taking it back; it was taken in, he signed the receipt, the man came back and asked for instructions, he was told we might leave it, if Pratt could make room for it, and it was charged to him—this was on the Saturday, and on the Monday, Pratt, of Storey-street, came and asked why his order had not been executed—I immediately entered it to Pratt, of Storey-street, and sent it to him—they both signed the receipts—Fox was the drayman—he did not tell me that he came back by Pratt's direction, he spoke to Mr. Westcott—a kilderkin would occupy about three quarters of a yard, lengthways—Pratt's passage would allow of about three kilderkins</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="184710250028"/>
               <p>lying there—it is rather a wide passage—it leads from the front door—the stairs are wider than the length of a kilderkin—I believe this kilderkin had not been tapped or touched—the chalk marks remained on the cask—Pratt might have let it through the trap-door into the cellar if he had been disposed to conceal it—I did not, on the 3rd of Sept., sent stout instead of ale to Pratt—when I questioned him on this subject, and called the circumstance to his recollection, he said, "On yes, to be sure, there were two of them," mean<lb/>ing two men—he did not tell me he was drunk at the time—he did not say, "I have no recollection, because I was drunk at the time"—as we were leav<lb/>ing, he said that he had been drinking on the Saturday.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Were are the receipts kept? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On and in my desk—I count out a number of these notes at a time, and give them to the loading out-porter—Lucy and Brookes are the foremen dray<lb/>men—I took these entries from the order-book, and gave the receipts to Lucy—we had about four or five loads at that time—I might have issued nearly 100 receipts on that day—we have from forty to forty-five drays, which are loaded sometimes twice, sometimes three times, and sometimes four times each, in the course of a day, on an average—sometimes they are only loaded once when they have long journeys to go—we issue these notes for town, and different notes for vessel or railway—sometimes we may load 60, 80, 100, or 150 for town delivery—there were, I think, eleven barrels and a half on this dray—that is nearly a full dray—at the time I had the conversation with Press on the Tuesday morning, I had found out that this kilderkin had been left at Pratt's—I was not present at the commencement of the conversation with Press—he was being questioned when I came in, and Mr. Jolliffe, a clerk to Messrs. Tanqueray, the solicitors, was taking down his answers—young Mr. Hanbury and Mr. Westcott were examining him—I accused him of having been to Pratt's, he said he had not.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Messrs. Parnell and Tanqueray, soli<lb/>citors to Messrs.

On the 25th of Sept., about four o'clock in the afternoon, I was walking from the London-docks to St. Katharine's-docks hotel to get my dinner, I heard a noise behind me, turned and saw Mr. Curtis, a butcher, who keeps a shop a few doors from the hotel, had got the prisoner—I saw my handkerchief drop from his hand—it had been safe in my pocket within five minutes—this is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi>, 582.) I was on duty in Mark-lane, on Saturday afternoon, the 14th Aug., about four o'clock—in consequence of some information I received I went to Mr. Crawley's, No. 12, Mark-lane, and there saw Yates—he told me that his master had been shot by a man in his office, or counting-house—I produced the key from Yates, and entered the counting-house—on going through the passage, and opening the inner door, I saw the prisoner sitting in a chair, in the inner counting-house, with his head leaning on his hands, and his elbows on his knees, bleeding from the mouth—there was a pistol lying on the desk by his side, the muzzle was covered with blood, and the pistol was quite warm—it was unloaded—it apparently had been recently discharged—a policeman named Edmonds, and Mr. Harris a surgeon, came to my assistance—I observed a second pistol in the chair the prisoner was sitting on—in moving him, it fell off on the floor—that pistol appeared to have been recently discharged—I took the prisoner in a cab to Guy's Hospital—when I found the second pistol, he said it was that d—d villain Crawley had caused all this, and he was sorry it had not gone through his head, meaning his own head, putting his hand to the side of his head—I did not ask him any question—he said, "I am sorry it has not gone through my head"—he several times afterwards asked how Mr. Crawley was, or whether he was much injured—he stated he had always got his living in an honest way, but he had been very wrongly done by—he mentioned Mr. Crawley's name several times on that occasion—I searched him in the counting-house, and found on him this paper, which I produce—I have had it ever since.</p>

                  </hi> I was co-assignce with the prisoner to the estate of a person named Bond; in the course of that business I became acquainted with his hand-writing—I believe this paper produced by Strickland to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The paper was here read as follows</hi>)—"Mr. Dawson has the painting of Jarius's daughter in security of the money I had on loan from him, which I wish to be settled, and intend doing so as soon as I get settled with Dr. Walker; but Mr. Sheard says he will try and claim the Statute of Limitation. This will show that he is a villain at heart, if he does so, and ought to be exposed to the world at large. See to this particularly. There are debts owing to me much greater than I owe, which can be collected, and every one paid that I justly owe, and there will be a surplus that will belong to you both, Mary and Beatrice. The disgrace which has been brought upon me by that villain, Crawley, is from my not consenting with him and Cremer to get possession of the Bull Inn, which I could not do; and I saw there was something underhand going on between them and Bond. When Cremer re<lb/>quested me to let him send in some articles to the Bull Inn he said that it might come to about 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., but him and Crawley have made a different affair of it; but it will end in no good to either of them—one must go for an example to deter other such wretches from doing the like. I cannot help saying that my solicitor ought to have looked into this matter of Bond's before he advised me to be an assignee in his bankruptcy, and which, had he done so, would have prevented all that has now occurred; death is far more preferable than the disgraceful situation this villain Crawley has placed me in, and driven me to do that which I never would have contemplated. This action will, no doubt, cause a very great deal of grief to you all, but you must forgive it, as you can never expect that I can know happiness again in this world, after this villain Crawley's conduct towards me, and to see me pine away after day, I know would break your hearts; therefore console yourselves, in the best manner you can, and I trust you will meet with kind-hearted friends who will assist you and condole with you in your affliction, and time will wear smooth that which may now appear so rough and rugged to your views and feelings. Remember me to poor old Mr. Jacobs. I hope that Mrs. Drummond will keep her promise, and get your nephew, Johnny, into Christ's Hospital; I know if she can get a presents<lb/>tion that she will do it.—To Mrs. Mary Dixon and Beatrice Jenkinson Ovenstone. 46, Upper Charlotte-street, Fitzroy-square.

                  </hi> I am a surgeon, in Fenchurch-street. On the 14th of Aug. Mr. Crawley was brought to my surgery a little after four o'clock—I examined him superficially, and saw that the hemorrhage had stopped—he had a bullet wound over the right upper jaw—he expressed a wish to go to the hospital—I told him he could go with safety, and I left him for that purpose—I then went down to Mr. Crawley's office, and found the prisoner in the position the other witnesses have described, sitting in a chair, with his head on his hands—I found that the ball had taken a superficial course, and lodged under the integuments of the scalp—the hemorrhage had ceased—the ball had taken a course under the left cheek, but I did not examine it, my attention was principally directed to the hemorrhage—I felt the ball with my head under the skin—he asked me, "How is poor Crawley?"—I told him I thought he would do well—he appeared dejected—he made no observation—I asked him what had taken place, or whether he had shot himself—I did not know ex<lb/>actly then what had taken place, and he intimated to me that he was exceed<lb/>ingly sorry that the ball had not gone into his brain, meaning his own brain—I cannot remember the exact expression he used, but it was to that effect—Mr. Crawley's wound was likely to be a dangerous one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Could you judge, from the appearance of the wound that the prisoner had inflicted upon himself, whether it was a wound that had been produced from putting the pistol into his mouth, and shooting from the inside? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I should suppose so—the wound was inside the cheek—there was an immense mass of hemorrhage and clotted blood about him—I did not wipe it away so as to ascertain the course the ball had taken, because I wished him to go off to the hospital when the hemorrhage had stopped.</p>

                  </hi> I am senior assistant-surgeon at St. Thomas's Hospital—I saw Mr. Crawley on Saturday, the 14th of Aug., about half-past ten o'clock—he had been brought to the hospital, and seen by two surgeons pre<lb/>viously—I examined him—he was in bed—I found a wound at the side of the bottom of the nose, in the cheek—it was a small round wound, it had the appearance of a gun-shot wound—I probed it, and found the probe touched metal—I extracted this bullet—(<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—it is flattened a good deal—it was embedded in the bone of the upper jaw—it had taken a direct course from where it entered, in a straight line backwards, towards the back part of the head—it was two inches and a half deep passing along the fangs of the teeth of the upper haw—I had not much difficulty in pulling it out—it was embedded in the bone to the extent of a quarter of an inch, or perhaps less—a sufficient surface was left for the forceps to lay hold of it—I took a firm hold of it with the forceps—I consider the wound was dangerous to life—it did not directly injure any part that was vital.</p>

                  </hi> I am surgeon to the Gaol of Newgate, and also surgeon to Sr. Thomas's Hospital. I saw the prisoner directly he was brought to Newgate—he had been previously under my care at the other pri<lb/>son—he</p>

               <p>was under my care from the time he was first remanded—I forgot the exact date, I think it was about the 18th or 28th of Aug.—he was taken to Guy's Hospital, and from there sent to us—he has been under my care ever since, either there or at Newgate, up to the present time—I have seen him constantly, and have, during the whole time, taken notice of his conduct, appearance, and demeanour—I have not observed anything to lead me to be<lb/>lieve that he is of unsound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Have you had conversations with him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—more lengthened of late than at first—I should say he was a reserved man—he was very much depressed when he came in—my evidence as to the state of his mind applies only to the time during which I have seen him—I have not been acquainted with his former habits of life, or the circumstances that surrounded him, shortly before this time, until the last day or two, I have heard a little, that is merely hearsay—I have known the desperate state of a man's pecuniary affairs to be a very frequent incident to partial derangement of intellect—great losses, or any great distress, will at times produce it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Will it not very frequently be found that immediately before an attack of this kind, a man has suffered from some severe vexation or disappointment, from family troubles or pecuniary embarrassment? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It has been believed that those circumstances have caused such excitement at different time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I do not mean to produce a wild madness and madness of that descrip<lb/>tion to continue, but I mean that partial derangement which will account for a man on a sudden doing a violent act—do you understand the distinction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I understand the distinction, but it is a very difficult question for me to answer—as far as I can answer it, I should expect that if a man's mind was upset by such circumstances, that it would remain so upset for a consider<lb/>able time—if I saw the person soon afterwards apparently sane, I should not be disposed to consider that he had been insane at that moment, for a short period, any more than I should if a man was put into a passion, which may be called madness—I know the senior physician at Hanwell, he is a man who is looked upon in the profession in every way as a man highly gifted, he has had very large opportunities of judging of this question, and of course his opinion would be worth more on such subjects than that of a person like myself.</p>

During the last five years I have been intimately acquainted with the prisoner and his business—I have noticed a very market alteration in his manner and conduct latterly—previous to that, he always struck me as a man of unusual kindness of disposition—there has been a very great change in his pecuniary affairs towards the last year—I have had under my notice, as his professional adviser, instances of large debts which have turned out to be bed, to a very large extent—a great many losses occurred almost simultaneously to a very large amount—I have noticed the effect this produced on Mr. Ovenstone's mind—he first began by complaining very bit<lb/>terly of the ingratitude he had met with from particular friends, who defended actions which he was compelled to bring for debts owing to him—I have sug<lb/>gested courses to be adopted which I thought proper; but he was so obtain towards the latter part of our connection with him, I mean he was so obstinate and stupid—I have not noticed that on previous occasions, when I have trans<lb/>acted business with him—he was the most docile client I ever acted in connec<lb/>tion with—he never would question anything—I have latterly perceived a very marked deficiency in his memory—his memory previously was strong, pow<lb/>perful, and retentive on certain points, particularly in matters of business—I perceived a failure on those particular points subsequently—I represented to him this matter of Mr. Crawley's in its right light, but I never could get him to my way of thinking upon it—I do not think he could have understood the facts as they really were—he did not appear to take a rational or common-sense view—he very frequently said, with great energy of manner, that he was quite sure there must be a conspiracy to ruin him on the part of all these people—Mr. Bond was bankrupt, he was an old intimate friend of the prisoner's, for the benefit of the estate, Mr. Ovenstone, as a friend, undertook the management of the hotel after Mr. Bond became a bankrupt—he lost a debt of 600<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. upon the estate, about 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. on the furniture, and then became liable for 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. more in the character of assignee, besides the other losses and bad debts; one was an instance of a house furnished to the extent of upwards of 400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the amount of bad debts occurring within about nine</p>

I have known the prisoner for twenty-two years—I have had opportunities of seeing him very generally during the last four years—I have latterly noticed a decided difference in his conduct and manner, an excitement brought on by his troubles—I never noticed conduct equal to that previously—it has displayed itself in various ways—latterly he could not have cast up three lines of figures—before that he was a moderately good accountant, not first-rate—he was able to cast up his books and balance them—he was not able to do that latterly—a lady, a friend of his, committed suicide this time twelvemonths—he had frequently alluded to that lately—it appeared to me to prey upon his mind very much—he has made very frequent allusions to it—I have frequently upon such occasions heard him give orders to his men, sometimes quite the reverse of reasonable—that has been latterly—he would arrange a thing overnight, and net morning not enter upon it, or entertain it, that was quite at variance with his former conduct—he has latterly spoken to me of apprehensions of a conspiracy—his pecuniary losses since 1844 have been about 3800<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and since May last about 1100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>; three actions at law, one pending now, which will not realize a penny—he very recently gave a person named Johns, of Newman-street, credit to a great extent for goods—sufficient inquiries were not made as to the stability of that person—I and other friends urged him not go on with it, till he had made inquiry, but he would not—knowing his habits of business, I certainly think he would not have given credit upon a former occasion—he would have been more cautious—some person who owed him money pleaded the Statute of Limitations, upon which Mr. Ovenstone engaged himself in writhing large placards—I did not see where he stuck them—I heard him threaten what he would do—he has been for many years living with two unmarried sisters—one of these sisters has recently married—that came suddenly upon him—he felt that he was taken by surprise, and he said, in a desponding state, that all the world was going to leave him and abandon him—he was very desponding—his sister had formerly taken care of the household, and he regretted her goingaway from him—this is one of the sort of placards he wrote—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one headed "Statute of Limitation Act"</hi>)—I observed the effect that the actions and proceedings had upon him latterly, before the 14th of Aug.—he was very he de<lb/>pressed indeed, sometimes highly excited, did not know what he was doing, running about wild telling his troubles, them sitting down, going to settle his affairs, then leaving for hours together, I have come back, and found it in the same state, and found nothing done—he has been laboring under very strong excitement—every little thing that happened appeared to affect him latterly—I saw him on the 12th of Aug.—he was very much excited then, raving against parties that had put an execution into his house—his conduct was not at all national or reasonable, running out of the house, and running from one house to another—I was with him in St. Paul's Churchyard on the 12th—he</p>

               <p>was very unruly about something at Mr. Sheard's—his conduct was violent—he seemed disposed to quarrel with me—eventually he would not go with me—at one time we were about parting—I saw him on Saturday, the 14th, a little after nine o'clock in the morning—hr then appeared very much depressed in spirits indeed, and was in tears—he said he had had a very restless night—his appearance was haggard and worn-out—he went about to several places, to no purpose whatever, apparently to get rid of me out of the way—I know his family—I do not know Mrs. Mary Dixon, I know Margaret—he has a sister named Mary—there were three sisters—Margaret is married to Mr. Dixon, one married Mr. Downey, and the other is unmarried—the document produced is directed to No. 46, Upper Charlotte-street—Mary is put for Margaret.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In a diseased state of mind, which is arrived at after a gradual progress, does soundness of mind return speedily or suddenly? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think sometimes it does, having had several examples in which persons have been sent to be under our care at Hanwell; where the history has been of that kind there has been a long course of conduct showing alteration of character, irritation of mind, then a violent assault has been committed, or an attempt at suicide, and immediately after that, the conduct of the patient has become comparatively calm, or even entirely so, and from that time recovery has commenced, and eventually taken place—that is sometimes attributable to the shock, some<lb/>times to physical effects, such as loss of blood, and sometimes to an alternation in the mode of living—a number of circumstances combine to produce the effect, but at the time the patient is quite sound.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Timothy Tormey, of No. 1, Glass-house-fields, Shadwell. On the 29th of May I and my husband slept at the prisoner's father's, at No. 8, Charles-place, Shadwell—we went to bed about eleven o'clock at night—the prisoner's father and mother came home after twelve—their room was next mine—I heard them quarrelling—I and my husband spoke about it to one another—my husband asked me what was the matter—on that the prisoner's mother came to the door—the prisoner then came to the door—he did not usually sleep in the house—he called for my husband to go outside the door, and called him a cowardly rascal—I fastened the door to prevent my husband going out, or the prisoner coming in—on that the prisoner went out into the front of the house—I raised up my win<lb/>dow and begged him to go and have peace—he <hi rend="italic">hove</hi> up a brick and struck me in the forehead, and I was stunned—I fell senseless—I do not know what happened afterwards—he threw it at me—I was taken to the London Hospital, and stopped there six months—the wound has not healed at present—there were two flower-pots on the window-sill—I did not throw them at the prisoner—I never offended him in my life, nor has my husband that I know of—he was in the room all the time—while I was at the hospital, there was a piece of brick taken from my forehead—I have it in my pocket—(<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>ducing it.</hi>)</p>

                  </hi> I am wife of George Mansfield Walls—we were last month living in the service of the Rev. Mr. Layton, of River-house, Duncan-place, St. Mary. Islington. On the night of the 6th of Oct., I and my husband went to bed between twelve and one o'clock—we were the last persons up—we fastened all the doors and windows—we slept in the kitchen under the back drawing-room—as I was going to bed I heard a noise—my husband took a candle, and went into the kitchen—he is not here—I did not go with him—he came back, and we retired to bed—after we had been in bed some time, I heard a noise again, like some one walking about the room—I tried to rouse my husband, but could not succeed—I got up, and went to the back drawing-room with a light—the door was not quite closed—I opened it, and saw two men, the prisoner was one—I thought I had seen him before, but did not know where—he had Mr. Layton's tea-caddy in both hands—the other man had a candle in his hand—the prisoner lifted up his hand, and said, "You be still,"—I shut the door, and went down calling "Murder!" to arouse the house—I went to the bottom of the stairs and rung a bell, which brought my husband and my master to my assistance—next morning I ex<lb/>amined the house with a policeman—the front drawing-room window shutters were pushed open, sufficient to get an arm in, when the window was open—I had fastened the inside shutter the night before, but the window-catch had something the matter with it, and it would only shut down—it could have been opened from the outside—the shutter was thrown open.</p>

                  </hi> I occupy River-house, Duncan-place, St. Mary, Islington—I went to bed early in the morning, and left Mrs. Walls up—I was alarmed, between one and two o'clock, by a violent outcry and the ringing of a bell—I put on a dressing-gown, and ran down into the room opposite to where the robbery was committed—it was undis<lb/>turbed, and I went into the opposite room, the back drawing-room, and found it in disorder—I found a crow-bar on the sideboard—I missed a silver pencil-case, and a pen-knife, from a work-basket, which was overturned, and the contents strewed about—the window and shutter had not been disturbed—I went into the front drawing-room, which communicates with the back by folding doors, which were open—on entering. I saw the window wide open, and the shutters thrown up—there was a pool of candle-grease on the table, which was slightly burnt, as if a candle had been set there—I found a cabinet broken open by such an instrument as this crow-bar, and missed from it about forty English and foreign coins, a mother-of-pearl snuff-box, set in silver, three massive gold mourning rings, a silver Palais Royal medal, an <hi rend="italic">elui</hi> case, and a great quantity of jewellery, principally ear-rings—I examined the win<lb/>dow and shutter, and found marks of violence—I did not apply the crow-bar to them, but could tell by my eye that it would have produced them—I also saw marks of the instrument against the window-frame outside—it could be lifted up from the outside; it is about four feet from the ground—it is a Venetian window, the centre opens, and the sides are closed—when it was open, any<lb/>body could easily remove the shutter—it is very long, and fastened in the centre by a small pin—a person could thrust his arm into the opening of the shutters, reach the spring lock of the bar, and throw it up—I saw that done afterwards, as an experiment—I afterwards examined the garden, and saw three footsteps—I cannot say whether they were of different people—my garden is enclosed by a wall five feet high—there is a public road on one side, and on the other side next to the window is the yard of the County-court.</p>

               <p>window, and saw him go into the water-closet with a pail—he remained there a minute or two—I saw him come out again, and bring the pail with him—it was a round pail, in the shape of a barrel, and was a pail that I knew to be in the house—it was their pail, and it was kept in their room—it had no cover—he went up stairs again—a short time after that, I went myself into the water-closet—it is an open privy—I observed traces of blood—they were from the yard and in the washhouse—I did not see any on the stairs—I washed away the blood myself, and while so doing I saw the female pri<lb/>soner up at the window, which was open—I said, "Oh, <hi rend="italic">Tilly</hi>, look at this!" (pointing at what I had seen) "some person has been into yard and done this; they ought to be ashamed to do so"—she said, "So they ought"—I took no more notice, but washed it away and went in doors—I saw her at the window again when the child was being taken out of the water-closet about a quarter of an hour afterwards, and said to her, "Curse that wretch; they are not ashamed to get them, and curse that wretch that would make away with them"—she seemed to speak very slightly—she said it was a very great shame—I said, "It was no stranger," and she said no, she did not think it was—she looked very pale—I went into the prisoners' room about twelve or one o'clock in the day—she was washing—I saw her throw a cloth over the tub—she seemed very ill, and I being the mother of children, thought she appeared like a lying-in woman—I have lived in the house eight years, and the prisoners near on two years—they have always occupied this same room—there was a little boy, about three years' old, living in the room besides—the female prisoner had been in my room on the Thursday morning, the 23rd—she appeared well in health then, and far advanced in pregnancy—I saw her about eleven o'clock on the Friday night, standing at the door, reclining at the side, apparently very ill—she said to me, "It is a fine night"—I said, "Yes, it is"—I said, "<hi rend="italic">Aint</hi> you well?"—she said, "No, Mrs. Nathan, I have got a cold"—she still appeared in a pregnant state then.</p>

I knew nothing of the prisoners until this matter occurred—on Sunday, the 26th of Sept., I was called in, and saw the female in the room where she had been living—I asked her if she had recently borne a child—she said, "No"—I then in<lb/>timated to her that I must make an examination, and wished the pre<lb/>sence of another female—some woman was brought in, I do not know who——I then proceeded to examine the prisoner, and found she had been recently delivered of a child—I told herso—she made no reply—I then proceeded to the dead-house where the body of the child was—I examined it externally, and found it a full-grown male child—the navel<lb/>string had been cut—it had passed through the first stool which a child generally voids soon after birth—that discharge would not take place after death—it is a vital action—the umbilical cord had been cut, but not tied—it had not been torn—there were no marks of violence about the child—it was stiff then—it was twenty-four hours or more after the discovery of the body—I cannot form a correct estimate of the time the child had been born—on the Tuesday, by order of the Coroner, I proceeded to make an in<lb/>ternal examination—I first opened the chest, and took out the lungs and the heart attached—I found that they floated—the lungs were sufficiently buoyant to sustain the weight of the heart—that indicated that they were fully and perfectly inflated—I then tried the separate lobes of the lungs, and found that each of them floated—I then cut the lungs into a number of small pieces, and carefully compressed them, still every piece floated, from which I am satisfied that they had been fully inflated—I believe the lungs of an infant could not be inflated to such an extent during the progress of delivary—it is possible, where a woman has no assistance—I examined the head of the child—there</p>

                  </hi> I am a surgeon in Hatton-garden. I was applied to, I believe by the prisoner, to go to the deceased, and requested Mr. Caldeleugh to go for me—upon a second application I went myself, about four o'clock on the Sunday morning—the woman was then quite dead—I found a large quantity of venous blood on the two highest steps of the stairs—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination on the Tuesday, and believe the hemorrhage to have been the cause of death—(<hi rend="italic">the witness here described the nature of the injury</hi>)—the injury might be caused by a kick behind, outside the clothes—it must have been with some violence—it was a lacerated wound, a tear.</p>

Q.</hi> Did you examine the lungs and heart? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No, n the head—the quantity of blood I saw was sufficient to account for the death—there was not less than three or four pints—I saw nothing else to account for immediate death.</p>

On Tuesday morn<lb/>ing, 5th of Oct., I was going round the house an usual—I was on the lawn within the garden walls—I sleep on the grounds—I noticed the window of the morning room open—I went to unlock the door that opens from the lawn into the kitchen-garden, and saw footmarks on the border near the wall—I found a button there—there were the footmarks of three different persons—I called up the housekeeper—I was present when Bradshaw the policeman compared a shoe with the footmarks in the garden, on Wednesday morning, about half-past seven, they corresponded—I gave the button to Bradshaw.</p>

On Tuesday morning, the 5th of Oct., I went to Lord Listowel's house, which is in the parish of St. Mar<lb/>garet's, Westminster, between eight and nine o'clock—I went into the morning-room, and the open window was pointed out to me—I examined it inside and out, and the shutters likewise—in my judgment it had been opened from the inside, a person could then come on to the balcony, and then there are three steps down to the garden—I went to the drawing-room, and found the front window of that open—I examined it from the outside—the handle of the shutter might have been turned easily, and by just pushing it, it might be forced in—the bar of the shutter would not fasten, so that outside push would open it, and the window was opened by it's being left not catched—there was a handle to it with a catch—I then went to a wall dividing the kitchen-garden from the lawn, and found several footmarks there—I traced the footmarks of three different persons down the kitchen-garden—I received this button from the gardener—on the evening of that same day I was in Knightsbridge, and saw the prisoner there in company with, I dare say, a dozen others—I took him into custody—before so doing, I observed a button off of his coat, which coat I produce—I took him to the station, and found 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and three halfpence on him—on the following morning I took his left shoe to Lord Listowel's, compared it with the footmarks there, and they exactly agreed—when I took the prisoner into custody, I told him I took him on suspicion of being concerned with others in committing a burglary at the Earl of Listowel's—he said he knew nothing about it—that was all he said—I found in the drawing-room a piece of greasy paper on one of the chairs, and two Lucifer matches on the carpet.</p>

On Tuesday afternoon, 8th of Sept., about three o'clock I went into my yard, and saw the prisoner standing about three yards inside our gate with a parcel under his arm—he asked me the price of a stove—I watched him—he kept going backwards and forwards, and looking at the stove—I said, "Do you want to buy it?"—he said, "Is that the lowest price"—I said, "Yes"—I took hold of his coat, and said, "Let me see what you have got"—he pulled me outside the gate—I found this pair of bellows under his coat, and I found a parcel on him—these are my bellows (<hi rend="italic">produced.</hi>)</p>

Hocking's service I was twenty-one months out of employment—I was endeavouring to do business for myself—I went to Messrs. Hocking's on the 9th of Aug.—I am married and have two children—eighteen months or two years ago a warrant was sent up to me from Norwich for neglecting go support an illegitimate child—I know a person in Great Union-street, Borough—I sent 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to her, but she could not be found—I do not recollect sending her a sovereign.</p>

On Sunday, the 3rd of the Oct., about half-past one in the night, the three prisoners came to the door and asked me if John Judge was at home—I said he was not—they forced me from the door, and said they would b—y well see what they could do—Johnson hit me in the side of the face, and put out the light—I had an opportunity of seeing their faces before the light was put out—the prisoners are the same men—when the light was out, M'Fell kicked me several times, against the stairs, and put his hand into my pocket three several times and pulled out 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., two or three six pences, and sixpence in halfpence—I know what I had in my pocket—I screamed out "Robbery!" and "Murder!"—I made my escape into the parlour—my husband was inside—he shut the door—they burst it open, and put out the light that was inside—my husband ran out at the door, and screamed "Murder!"—they all three ran out, and the policeman came—I could see them by the light of the fire—I am sure that M'Fell is the man who kicked me—i have been under a doctor since, and I am sure that M'Fell is the man who kicked me—I have been under a doctor since, and I am seven months in the family way.</p>

                  </hi> On Friday night, the 22nd of Oct., about twelve o'clock, I was in a public-house in Whitechapel-street, with my husband. I saw the prisoner there—my husband left, in consequence of missing a ring off his finger—as soon as he was gone out, one of the women was going to leave—I said, "Stop a minute, my husband will be back with a policeman, and perhaps you will have no objection to be searched"—I went to the threshold of the door, and she struck me—I fell, and the prisoner came and thrust his hand down my bosom, to take my watch from me—I grasped his hand, and tried to raise myself up, and he kicked me at the side of the temple—I fell down again, with the pain, but I held his hand till I rose myself up, and found the policeman at my elbow—the prisoner did not suc<lb/>ceed in getting the watch—he put his hand in twice, and caught hold of it the second time, but I held it till the policeman came up.</p>

I saw the prisoner kicking at the side door, and when she found she got no answer there, she came to the front door—I looked out of the front room window—she kicked the door open, and went in—I did not see her come in, but I heard her after she was in—some persons came round the door, and she swore at them—I saw her come out afterwards, and then she went away—she was afterwards taken into custody.</p>

I am produce two plaint-books, in which the original plaints of suitors are entered—they begin at the 3rd of April and are down to the present time—I have examined them from before the 24th of July to the present time—there is no entry in which Samuel Colley is plaintiff, or William Crispin either, there are no such names—it is the custom when a plaint is entered to give a plaint-note, that is a voucher—the district of that Court includes Marlborough-road, Chelsea.</p>

                  </hi> I am a <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>-proprietor, at Marlborough-road, Chelsea. The prisoner was my foreman, I paid him two guineas a week—it was his duty to look after the <hi rend="italic">cabmen</hi>, to receive the money from them, and account to my housekeeper or to me the morning after—this is the book in which it was his duty to make an entry of the amounts he received—here is no entry of 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. received on the 14th of March, nor 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on the 21st—on the 25th of July here is an entry of 7<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. to Collins—here is no entry of 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that day nor afterwards.</p>

Q.</hi> How many <hi rend="italic">cabmen</hi> had you in your employ? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Sometimes fourteen or fifteen—he had to receive money from them all and to pay it to me or to my housekeeper—her name is Sarah Ballard, not Beck<lb/>enham—I do not know that she is ever called Beckenham—I never heard her called so—this is the first time I ever heard the name to the best of my belief—this is the first suggestion I have ever heard about it—I do not know that the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> sometimes call her Mrs. Beckenham, and sometimes Colley—her husband's name is Ballard—I do not know where he lives—she is my housekeeper—I never complained that she rather intercepted the money coming to me—I know a man named Morgan—I cannot tell when I made the charge against the prisoner—the first time I found a deficiency was in Aug.—be left me the last day of July—I think I gave him in charge in Sept., I cannot tell on what day—I had looked over the books before then—he went through the accounts about the middle of July—I should have given him in custody in Aug., but I could not find him, he absconded—he has been admitted to bail, and has surrendered here to-day—I did not hear from Morgan that he had threatened to inform of me for cheating the Excise—there would not have been aword of truth in it—I have been to the Excise since this—I heard of</p>

Elliott's drays in March last—I gave my case to Mr. Hollis Anthony, for him to bring an action in case they did not settle—I think he got 23<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for me, I cannot exactly recollect—I did not direct the prisoner to appear on the trial, if necessary, and represent the damage done to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—the prisoner was foreman of my yard—I do not know whether he was the first person who saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> when it was brought home—I was in bed and asleep at the time—the prisoner did not say there was no injury done to the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> at all—he could not say that, for he went and got the report from the station, where the drayman was locked up—he reported the circumstance of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> being broken to me—I said, "You had better see about it," and he went to the station—he said the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> was smashed all to pieces, which it was—he was not present to give evidence, but he saw the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I should not think that he knew all about it—he did not understand it—I have never been in trouble—I never was tried for any<lb/>thing in my life—I have sat here as a juryman—I have lived eighteen years in the neighbourhood where I now reside.</p>

                  </hi> I am the wife of Edward Wilson, a confectioner, we live in Hoxton Old-town. The younger prisoner was in my service about six months—she lodged and boarded in my house—the other prisoner is her mother—she frequently came to see her daughter at the door, but was not permitted to come in—she was not in the house that I am aware of—I missed my bed-gowns and frock about the 14th of August—I told the younger prisoner I had lost them—she said she did not know anything about them, she had not seen them—I have since traced them to Mrs. Spiers', who keeps a general shop in Hare-street, Bethnal-green.</p>

I was stationed in the West India Dock basin, about seven o'clock in the evening—there was a strong smell of spirits, which I supposed was rum, and I heard a driving of spiles—I stood up, and saw three men in the lighter, <hi rend="italic">Major</hi>—I might be from twelve to twenty yards from them—I went on board, saw one man on the cabin-head, and two below—I asked the man on the cabin-head if he was captain—he said, "No"—the other two were down by the casks—they stepped into the cabin—I went down, and found the casks were spiled—I called out, "Lightermen!"—the men in the cabin gave no answer—I lighted a match, went into the cabin, and found the two prisoners and no one else there—I said, "Why did not answer me when I first hailed you?"—Wells said he was asleep, and did not hear me—I followed them into the cabin—Gingle pretended to the asleep—I merely held the light up to him, and said, "O, it is you"—he made no answer—I had known him for years—Wells said he was very sorry for what was done, he had been to a coffee-shop, and they had done this while he was away—he did not say what was done—I considered he meant the spiles—I went to the doc-gates, and spoke to another revenue-officer—he came on board, and found the spiles sticking out of the casks as I had—he went back to fetch his light, and while he was away Wells broke the spiles—I told him he would be held to account for that, that they would be gauged the next day, and he would have to account for it—the man who was on the head of the cabin stepped off the lighter to another craft—I have not seen him since—I did not stop him—I was satisfied he had nothing in his hands—there was an empty bladder found in the body of the lighter.</p>

                  </hi> I am an independent gentleman, living at Leyton, in Essex. On the 25th of Oct., between three and four o'clock in the after<lb/>noon, I was fishing in the river Lea—I had been fishing there from eleven o'clock—I was within view of the railway—I was not 400 yards from it all day—I saw several trains pass backward and forwards up to the time men<lb/>tioned, without impediment—I saw the prisoner, between three and four o'clock, as I thought throe a quantity of stones on the railway—I could not see that they were stones, but I saw the action of his body, stooping and picking them up, and I heard them fall very heavily on the line, and heard some of them strike together as they fell—I laid down my rod and watched him—I had been watching him previously, as no person had and right to be where he was—I should think I watched him for about a quarter of an hour alto<lb/>gether—there is a gate and a stile—I saw him get over the gate, and walk nearly in a direction towards me—when he came up to me I said, "Have you been clearing the rails?"—he was then advancing near me—he said, "No"—I had a little conversation with him about angling, and I saw a down-train approaching—the prisoner did not say anything—I said, "Why, there is the train coming," watching his countenance all the time—he made no reply, but walked on pretty smartly over the marshes—I saw the train come on, and when it got to where I had seen the prisoner, I saw some stones lying on the line—I went close up, and could see them—they were between the rails—the train stopped suddenly, and I saw a man get down from the engine—I ran up as fast as I could, and met the man at the spot where the prisoner had been—I pointed out the prisoner, who was then running—I described his dress—I have no doubt that he is the person—when I saw the stones, they were between the rails—they had been cleared by the guard, and laid in safety.</p>

               <p>day—I should have thought he saw me—he appeared to be picking up some<lb/>thing heavy and casting it from him, hurling the stones on to the railway—I can make no mistake about his picking them up—I saw him pick them up—I have given an account of this before—I had passed the rails in the morn<lb/>ing, and there were no stones in that position then—I saw him throwing the stones—he seemed to take his time about it—I think I can swear he was a quarter of an hour there—I saw no other person—I saw him in a stooping position—he had been throwing something, but I could not see what he was doing—I heard the stones falling heavily—I was very much shocked—I thought that he was doing wrong, and I was several times inclined to run over to see what he was doing, but I came to the conclusion that very possibly he might be employed by the Company, because I had seen persons before, repairing the rails in different places, and this person was better dressed, I thought he might have been an overseer, and for that reason I did not go—the next thing I saw was the prisoner again getting over the gate—I was watching him—he was only in conversation with me a few minutes—two or three words passed between us—I had never seen him before—he appeared a little <hi rend="italic">fresh</hi>, but not so much but he knew what he was about—the train passed the place where the prisoner had been standing, then it stopped, and one of the guards got down—the prisoner was then walking smartly away—when I pointed him out, he ran—he was about two hundred yards from me when I pointed him out—he had continued walking—I went up to the rails to speak to the man, and saw the stones—I saw more than three or four as large as the largest of those produced—they were between the rails—I was more than a dozen altogether—they were of different sizes.</p>

                  </hi> I live at No, 58, Wheeler-streets, Spitalfields, and am guard to one of the trains on the Eastern Counties Railway. Last Mon<lb/>day afternoon, when the down train got near the Lea-bridge Station, I heard the guard's whistle, the signal of danger, on which I applied the break and stopped the train as quickly as possible—the fireman jumped off the engine before the train had stopped, and ran back to a gate—in consequence of something that he said to me, I directed my attention to the prisoner—he was pointed out to me by Davison, the fireman—he was running from the rails—I went after him, with another guard, and overtook him at the farther end of the Lea-bridge marshes—when we were near upon him, he turned round and walked towards us—I took him by the collar, and told him he was my pri<lb/>soner he said, "What for?—I said, "For placing some stones on the line of railway"—he said, "You did not see me do it"—I told him there was a gen<lb/>tlemam close by who did see him do it—he mad no answer to that—I told him he must be a very wicked man, as he had been drinking, to try to throw the train off the line—he could scarcely speak when I got up to him, he was out of breath—he said he had not been drinking—he walked very quietly with me to the station—on the way he asked me where he should see me to<lb/>morrow—the other guard said he would let him know in the evening—when we had got him in safe custody, we went back, and found twenty-two stones on the line—I have brought some of them here—some were on the up-line and some on the down-line—when I saw them, the fireman had put them off the line—we have what we call "life-guards" to the engines—they are pieces of metal, that push off anything that is on the line—some of the stones had been broken by the train passing over them—I did not myself perceive the motion as the train passed over—it was evident at the time that the stones had been recently broken by being crushed—I was in the back part of the train.</p>

                  </hi> I am clerk to Mr. Knapp, a barrister, and live at No. 1, Walcot-square, Lambeth. On Saturday night, the 9th of Oct., I was at the Cornwall Arms, Cornwall-road, and saw the prisoner there—I asked if he would go of an errand for me to Princes-street—he went, and returned in twenty minutes—there were several persons there besides the prisoner, but he was drinking with two in particular—I had to change half-a-sovereign for the purpose of his going on the errand—he saw me do that—I paid for two pints of ale, which he drank the best part of—I gave him 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for going on the errand—he said I had given the landlord a sovereign instead of a half-sovereign, and told me to look—I put my hand into my pocket, found my</p>

                  </hi> I carry on business in partnership with John Doulton, in High-street, Lambeth. On the 24th of Aug., about three o'clock, in con<lb/>sequence of something I heard, I went to the Victoria-road, Kensington, and saw the prisoner there—I told him I understood he had called at our count<lb/>ing-house, and required a quantity of pipes for a sewer he was about to build in that neighbourhood—he said he did, he should want 600 of 9-inch pipes—I said, "I understand that the ground landlord of the property will be here, and will give me a guarantee for the payment"—he said he was there, and introduced me to a gentleman who he called Richard Day, Esq., of Eltham, who he said banked at Herries, Farquhar, and Co.—I and the prisoner walked on together, and left Mr. Day there—we went to Kensington new workhouse—it was not quite finished then—there was a sewer being made in the neigh<lb/>bourhood—the men were at work at it—he said, "You see that they are getting on with it, and if you don't send the first thing in the morning, they will be standing still"—he was almost within hearing of the men, I think they could have heard him, and he pointed to them—after that I went back to Mr. Day, and went to a public-house with him, and he gave me a guaran<lb/>tee for the payment, which I produce—it was given in the prisoner's presence—the next morning he sent a man, saying the works were standing still, and in consequence of what had passed the previous day, I sent fifty stone pipes, worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—a day or two after that, in consequence of something that my man told me, I went to look after the prisoner—he was not at home—he had left an address in my counting-house—I found the pipes were at Marl<lb/>borough-road, Chelsea, at the premises of Messrs. Humphrey and Thirak, on some premises that were building about a mile and a half from the sewer—I have never been paid—I made repeated applications, and wrote to Mr. Day, and he said when the order was completed, he would see that Mr. Marson paid it.</p>

Donnel, who lived at Chelsea; that he had left him, through his doing some business for Mr. Richard Day, and had now started on his own account; that he had got some houses now to paint, I think he said five, and he wanted a lot of colour and <hi rend="italic">turps</hi> to do them; would I supply them—he presented to me this bill (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—he left it with me—it is drawn by Marson upon Richard Day, Esq., of Eltham—I said I would take the bill, if he would let me take the particulars, and let me inquire at the Bank if it was all right—I took the particulars of the bill and made inquiries; and in consequence saw him again about the 12th—he then gave me the order, which was for a quantity of white lead and other things—this is the invoice (<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>), I took the bill—he said, "Be sure and send them over directly, because the workmen are standing still"—the bill is for 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

Waite was my shopman—I gave him in charge, and got an order from a Magistrate to search Symmonds' house—she at first denied having goods in the house—afterwards when the policeman said, "I shall look at see"—she said, "We have some that were delivered to me yesterday, and I have not paid for them, because I wash for Robert and do for him" (meaning Waite)—she brought down a great quantity of butter and cheese, and said something to her son—he ran into the yard with two books, which he put down the water<lb/>closet—the policeman got them out—these are them (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—there are entries in them to a very great amount, since the 14th of May, of the delivery of cheese and butter which I believe to be my property—they show the delivery of goods which Mrs. Pickering has received—she acknowledged they were mine—she said Robert had been in the habit of bringing goods to her house, and she had not paid him for them, because she did for him.</p>

                  </hi> I am shopman to William Kingston, of West<lb/>minster-bridge-road—on Wednesday, the 22nd of Sept., at half-past three in the afternoon, the prisoner Mason and another woman came to the shop and asked to look at some black edgings—I showed them some of different widths—there was some lace in the same box—I took out several cards of lace and edging, and laid them on the counter—Mason and the other woman looked at them—Mason asked for a yard and quarter of black edging—it was 8 1/2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a yard—I served her—I then went and got some other goods to show them—I was away a very short time—long enough for a person to go out of the shop and return without my observing it—I then sold something to the other woman—the officer came in and told the foreman not to let the women go—I think Mason heard it—the foreman then spoke to me—I looked at the goods at the door—I did not miss anything—in a quarter of an hour afterwards Laylan and I went to the station—I there saw three cards, con<lb/>taining 48 yards of lace, worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I knew them to be my master's property—I had had it out while Mason and the other woman were there—this is it.</p>

                  </hi> (<hi rend="italic">City policeman</hi> 133.) On the 9th of Oct., I received in<lb/>formation from Doughton. I went to the Swan, in the Dover-road—I gave Doughton a marked sovereign—I followed him to the stable, and saw Wealfare—he was bringing a sack from one of the stalls in the stables—he looked at me, and said, "You have got a good bargain'—I said, "Is it full size?"—he said, "Yes, it is fifteen feet long"—the sack was them put on Doughton's shoulder, and taken out—I asked Wealfare what he sold it for—he said, "1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I said, "Was it your property?"—He said, "No"—I said, "How do you account for the possession of it?"—he said, "I know nothing of it, I was only told to sell it"—I said I was an officer, and asked him to be so kind as to hand me the sovereign—he put his pocket, and gave me the marked sovereign out.</p>
