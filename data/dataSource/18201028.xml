They asked me to draw them a pint of beer; I went to the back of the room to draw it - they were then about half-way towards the fire-place. Soon after they left I missed the watch from the mantle-piece. White had come in while the prisoners were there to borrow a corkscrew. They asked what it was o'clock when they went out, I told them it was six - there was a clock in the room.</p>

            . I live in St. John's Wood-lane, Marylebone. On Saturday evening, the 30th of September, at six o'clock, I turned my gelding into Mr. Rice's field, by the canal; next morning, about six o'clock, I went to the field and missed it. I traced it over two ditches, and then lost the trace. On Monday morning, in consequence of information, I went and saw Hedges' son, and he went with me to Ford's, in Cow-cross, Smithfield, I there saw the skin of a grey gelding, which I am sure was mine. I turned round, and picked up a horse's leg, which I am also sure was mine.</p>

            . I am a collar-maker, and live in the Edgeware-road - I have often seen the prisoner pass my house. On the 30th of September, at nine o'clock at night, my son brought the prisoner to me at the King's Arms, public-house. He asked me if I would buy a dead horse? I said Yes, and asked whose it was; he said it was his master's, Mr. Hicks, cow-keeper, in Shoe-lane, Holborn, and it must be taken away. I said I could not fetch it that night, he said it must be taken away that night, as his master did not like it to lay in the field with the cows. We went to the field to fetch the horse - it was in the second field in the Harrow-road, past the second bridge. The horse lay there - it was a grey one, and had been stuck in the throat - blood had flowed. I took it home, and the next morning sold it to Ford.</p>
               <p>Q. What has a collar-maker to do with dead horses - A. We buy them. I gave him 30 s. for it, and sold it for 2 l. It was dark when I was in the field. I could see no<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280004"/>cows. I bought some harness of the prisoner about a fortnight before. On Monday morning Smith came to me, and I apprehended the prisoner myself on Thursday morning, at his house at Kensington Gravel-pits. I found there was a Mr. Hicks, a cow-keeper, in Shoe-lane. As soon as Smith saw the leg and skin he claimed them. He told me the marks on it before he went there.</p>

               <p>"You must know who she was?" - he said he had an insuperable objection to tell me; I said I was placed in such circumstances that I really must know; he then said he should have no objection to inform Mr. Mortlock, or Mr. Brewer our head cashier; I said Mr. Mortlock was not at home, and asked him to walk with me to see Mr. Brewer. He would not inform Mr. Brewer or me. I asked him if he had any objection to write to Mr. Mortlock what he had to say; he objected to that, but wished to write to Mr.

            . I am an officer. I took the prisoners into custody. I took Read at his house in North-street, and questioned him how he came by the plates found at Cook's; he said he had them from a lady, but refused to tell who she was. I found a pair of boots, some flowerpots and a china cup, at the cottage of one King. I took Gentle the same evening, and found three keys on him; he said one was the key of his box at his master's, and the others were keys of two boxes which he had at King's cottage, who was also in Mr. Mortlock's employ. One of them was a skeleton key, the wards were filed out. He then acknowledged that it was not the key of his box, but the key of his master's desk, and that he filed out the wards himself to fit his master's desk. I found it did open the desk. When I returned from King's I told him what I had found; he said they were all his master's property, he had taken them and had robbed his master of a great deal more, and had given nearly all the property to Read, who disposed of it, and brought him his share of the money; that he had received about 80 l. as his share, and gave nearly all of it to a young woman named Wilmot, who he was about to be married to. I searched her boxes where she was in service, and found a china cup, a smelling bottle, with a book of a Saving Bank, as a receipt for 75 l. Wilmot came into the presence of Gentle, and said she had the money, cup and smelling-bottle from him. He acknowledged it, and said it was Mr. Mortlock's property, and the money was the produce of the stolen goods. I said nothing to induce him to confess, and the Magistrate reasoned with him on the impropriety of signing his confession - I saw them both sign them.</p>

I made the key about twelve months ago; I opened the desk sometimes once a week, and sometimes twice. I do not claim the money in the Saving Institution as my property, but consider it being the property of Mr. Mortlock as the produce from the sale of the china given to Read and disposed of by him, and paid to me by Read as my share.</p>

               <p>READ'S Defence (written). I stand before you a dreadful example of the consequences arising from a master overstepping his line of duty, by depriving a servant unjustly of the character due to his services. Previous to my entering the employ of my prosecutor, I had lived fifteen years in some of the first families in London. I served my prosecutor for three years, in a situation of considerable confidence, with fidelity, and left him with assurances of support in placing me in business, and to which my father added the offer to him of 200 l. to promote that object. From some motives, of which I am ignorant, I was suddenly deprived of my prosecutor's and my father's flattering support, and found myself divested of friends, character, and employ. By casual employment, and some money saved by industry, I waited in hopes of the offer of some other situation, till becoming deeply embarrassed, I became involved in the charges which has led to the present indictment. My prosecutor having known my family for nearly forty years, and myself from childhood, deprived of the testimony of my friends from the influence of my prosecutor over their minds, I throw myself on the mercy of your Lordship and a Jury of my countrymen, and shall bow with humble submission to their judgment.</p>

            . On the 3d of October I received a letter at my house in James-street, Westminster, by the two-penny post, it is signed B. B. B., and dated the 2d of October - (producing it.) I have not the least knowledge of the hand-writing, and know nobody answering to the name B. B. B. I never saw the prisoner to my knowledge, except at the police office. On receipt of the letter I sent for Pace, an officer of Queen-square, and in consequence of his advice I wrote a letter and took a copy of it; I sealed it myself, and gave it to the officer; and on the evening of the 12th or 13th I received another letter with the same initials.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you married - A. I am, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see any of the prisoner's relations to your knowledge - A. Not till I saw his father at the office; but at the office I found that his aunt washed my family's clothes, but I do not believe I ever saw her. She only fetches the linen, she does not wash in the house. I never saw the prisoner about my house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ANDREWS. Q. Do you think you never saw the prisoner about your house with his aunt - A. Not to my knowledge. I am seldom at home when the linen is fetched. I did not know the letter came from him till he was apprehended.</p>
               <p>Q. The letter gave you no alarm - A. I certainly thought if there was a report of that kind it must come from my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280006"/>servants, and wished to find it out - it gave me considerable uneasiness. Mrs. Rodber was at Weybridge at the time I received it.</p>

Neither of us held him out threat or inducement. I asked him how he came to write Mr. Rodber such a letter as he had? he said he had been attending the House of Lords, and there he met a young man who asked him to write a letter for him, and he being out of a situation at the time was very willing to do so. I then asked him whether he wrote the letter signed</p>

            . I am an officer. On Sunday evening the 1st of October, I apprehended the prisoner - his mother being dangerously ill, I pretended I wanted him to mind his master's house. I took him to the watch-house, and found a 1 l. note, and 18 s. 6 d., a knife, and a box of brass dominos upon him. I asked him where he passed the note? he said in Long-lane, and shewed me Barton's house there; I took him in, and asked Barton if he knew him? he leant across the counter, and said to the prisoner</p>
               <p>"Do I know you" - he made no answer. I said</p>
               <p>"Should you like to give a boy in this situation change for anything?" he then said to the boy</p>
               <p>"Have I given you change for anything?" I told the boy he had better say nothing, and asked Barton if he had given him change or not? he said he was not in that dress; I told the prisoner to pull his great-coat off; he then said</p>
               <p>"That is the dress he was in, I gave him change for a 5 l. note one day this week." He produced the note, and it corresponded with the number I had received, 17825. The prisoner said he bought a donkey in Smithfield for 18 s. out of it, and paid 2 s. for a day's keep, at the livery-stables for it, and 2 s. for shoeing it, he paid 1 s., to a costermonger for letting it be in his stable, and 9 s. he paid for the breeches he had on. Barton said he gave him 2 l. the first day, and the rest a day or two after.</p>

On the 16th of September, between ten and eleven o'clock, I was coming from town alone, and when I got within four miles of home, just on this side of the stone bridge on the Harrow-road, near the Coach and Horses, public-house, I heard the sound of some people in the road, in a kind of a trot run - it appeared the sound of more than one person. I stopped a moment, and three of them passed me in the road. I said</p>
               <p>"I wish you good night, gentlemen, you seem in a hurry" - they made no answer, but went on twelve or fourteen yards, and jumped up on the footpath. When I came up to them one or two others came behind me, and patted me on the shoulder; one of those before me said,</p>
               <p>"D - n you, have you got any money?" I said</p>
               <p>"No, I am only a hard-working man, have nothing to depend on but the sweat of my brow, and have been out of a situation since February - you cannot expect I have much about me." I had scarcely spoken these words before those in front turned my waistcoat pocket inside out, took my tobacco-box and penknife, took my watch from my fob, which cost me seven guineas and a half, and about 9 s. in silver from my pocket - they also took some halfpence and three balls of worsted from my coat pocket - they returned the worsted. When they were going to rob me, I told them I hoped they did not intend to ill-use me; one of them said No, if I did not resist.</p>
               <p>Q. You know none of them - A. No, it was very dark. I said I thought none of them were much taller than myself, but I could not exactly tell; they might have stooped. On the 9th of October I saw a white-handled penknife in the hands of Lack, which was that I lost; I have found nothing else.</p>

            . I was in company with my brother officers on the Harrow-road for near a week, and on Saturday night, the 30th of September, about eight o'clock; the prisoners, Hughes and Smith, passed as; Hunt and Eaton came on, and bid us good night - they were about one hundred yards behind the others. Limbrick, Chapman, and Woodbury were with me. We jumped up and pursued them all; they were walking on. Hunt and Eaton were then before Smith and Hughes. I went up to Smith, and said,</p>
               <p>"What are you doing here? I am an officer." He directly pulled out this pistol - (producing it.) I seized it by the barrel, and wrenched it from him, it was loaded with powder and shot. I handcuffed him, turned my head round, and Eaton was by his side; I collared him, and Woodbury came to my assistance. I searched Smith, and found on him a half-crown, a shilling, a six pence, and a pocket-piece; and on Eaton I found five half-crowns, two shillings, two-pence, and a knife. Limbrick took Hughes, and Chapman took Hunt. Perkins claimed the knife. A pistol was found on Hunt in my presence.</p>

I have had it about six weeks. I bought it when I was making hat-boxes in the Summer, and bought a pair of scissars at the same time.</p>

On the last Wednesday in September, between seven and eight o'clock in the evening, I was in the Harrow-road, in a single horse chaise, alone; a little beyond the two mile stone from London, three men came up to me - the road was repairing, and I was driving very gently - it was very dark. They came from the footpath, rushed up to me, and cried</p>
               <p>"Stop!" One took hold of the reins at the horse's head, another came on the left, and got into the gig; the other came on the right and got on the step. The man who got in presented a pistol at my forehead, and demanded what I had. He took from my left breeches pocket one 10 l. and six 1 l. notes; he desired me to be quiet and he would not hurt me. The man on the step took my gold watch from my fob, which had two gold seals, a gold key, and a ring; he also took 15 s. or 16 s., and from one of my pockets I lost a gold lancet-case, containing two lancets; he took a silk handkerchief, and demanded my box-coat - I begged for it, saying I was a medical man, going a great distance, and that the weather was very cold. The one who held the reins called out,</p>
               <p>"Blow his b - dy brains out, if he does not make haste!" They took the coat, and the one on the left looked to see if he had dropped anything in the gig, and finding my glove, he gave it to me, and told me to drive on. They went through a field. I have since seen my pocket handkerchief at Bow-street on the Monday after I was robbed, or the Thursday following. I will not swear, but I really believe Eaton, by his voice, to be the man who presented the pistol, and Hughes, by his voice, I believe to be the man who came on my right. Hunt I will not swear to, but it was a slender man who held the horse.</p>

            . On the 30th of September I was out with other officers - we took the prisoners; Hunt was the foremost towards the country. I told him to stop, for I was an officer, he immediately ran towards London. I told him if he did not stop I would fire at him, he pulled out a pistol. I secured him, and found two 1 l. notes, three half-crowns, a sixpence, four-pence, a steel purse, a handkerchief, and a comb on him. The pistol was loaded with swan-shot and powder.</p>

I was in the Harrow-road, going home in my chaise-cart, at the rate of six miles an hour, the moon was remarkably bright; I saw three men about twenty yards off, as I advanced near they separated - one sprung from the footpath and seized my horse, that was Hughes. Eaton went round to the horse's head and caught hold of the reins likewise - the other prisoner jumped on the step of the cart, and the other jumped up, both came into the cart nearly together. Hunt had this bludgeon - (producing it) - it is the rail of a fence; it dropped out of his hand as he searched me, and I found it in the road. I asked what they wanted? they said my money. I said,</p>
               <p>"You shall have it if you will not illtreat me;" both said,</p>
               <p>"We will not ill-treat you." Hunt said he would not ill-treat me if I would be quiet. He rifled my pockets, and took about 25 s. my comb, and a bunch of keys, which he returned. They searched for my watch, but did not feel it then. Eaton

             a knife, went behind the cart, trod on the wheel, felt for my pocket, and found a pocket-book in it, he cut my pocket off and took it away altogether. I asked them to have the goodness to give me the papers which were in it, and which were of no service to them; they did not, but all retreated into the footpath. I stood up in my cart, and asked them to return my papers, as they were of service to me. They returned and threw the pocket-book into the cart without the papers. There was a 10 l. bill in it which they took. They entered the cart again as I stood up, unbuttoned my coat, and my watch-chain dropped down, they then found I had a watch. I said,</p>
               <p>"Don't take my watch;" they said,</p>
               <p>"We shall have it," took it, and retreated - it was a silver watch, the chain, seal and key were gold. It was very light - I saw all the prisoners as plainly as I do now and had an opportunity of taking a full view of them. I have since seen the tortoise-shell comb in Chapman's possession. I had had it for a year.</p>
               <p>Prisoner HUNT. Q. At the first examination you fixed on Smith instead of me and pointed him out - A. I did not. I recognized Hunt immediately, and did not point at all.</p>

            . I am a labourer, and live at Northolt, the prisoner lived nine or ten weeks at my house. On a Sunday, after they had had their dinner (I think it was two or three months ago) at my house, the prisoner asked his brother for a little money, Stephen said he had none at present, but would sell him some ewes or wethers if he liked. They agreed for seven ewes, at 12 s. each - they came to four guineas; the prisoner then said if he would give him 16 s., it would make the sum he owed him, which was 5 l.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Did you see any money paid - A. Yes, 16 s. I heard them say they fetched the sheep from Harrow on the Hill. I saw them six or seven weeks ago at Northolt, in the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Tell us when you saw them last - A. I cannot say exactly - it was a month or five weeks ago the outside; they were then in the possession of Stephen - it was after the bargain was made.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever know them sell each other sheep before - A. No. I cannot say they were the sheep which Watson had.</p>

There was a quantity of papers in the chambers when she first came. I have not attended lately, being ill. I always told her never to meddle with papers written on, and not to destroy them. She also worked for the Remembrancer and Mr. Montague; I was laundress to them all. I had noticed her with money, which excited my suspicion, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280013"/>asked her how she came by it? she said she had a friend, who supplied her.</p>

            . I heard a watchman come into the public-house, and call Corking. I went on the ride, and saw Corking upon the roof; he said somebody was gone through the hole, and in about two minutes I saw the prisoner come out of the stable, which the hole led to. I found the lead by the hole, and matched it to the gutter, it matched.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. Mrs. Dell came, and said if I would acknowledge it, no harm should come to me. Instead of my begging her pardon, I refused to do it. I admit I have been on the tiles cleaning the gutter, as the wet came in upon my bed, but was not on this night. On this evening I was rather tipsey, and quarrelled with my wife; I went to sleep in the stable, and was awoke by a noise, came out, and asked what it was about. Two or three men might have come out, while I went for the light.</p>

I got information on board a ship, and found Toms and Wootton sitting in a public-house, eating soup with these silver spoons; they laid them upon the table as we entered the room. The officer took six spoons off the table, and we found two upon Toms, also a crown, half-crown, one shilling, and a silk handkerchief claimed by Tucker, and round Wootton's neck I found a silk handkerchief; I asked him what had become of the remaining spoon? he said we took but nine - (I had found one upon a sailor boy, who was with them) - he said</p>

            . I am a patrol. I was informed that Hutley was concerned in the robbery; I went to his father's house in Little Bell-alley, and asked if he was there? his mother said No, he had not slept there since Tuesday - (this was Thursday evening) - I said it was useless saying so, for he was seen going into the house; she then said he was in the house. I went up, and found him upon the bed; I took him to the watch-house, and said it was a pity he went on as he did; he said he would tell me the truth - I neither threatened or promised him. He said on the day previous to the robbery, Wootton told him if he and Toms came to Fleet-street on Sunday, he should be able to supply them with money; that he and Toms accordingly went on Sunday evening, Wootton let them in, and they carried out 23 s. in silver, 13 s. 6 d. in copper, three silk handkerchiefs, and ten spoons. They then went to Gravesend by the boat, and sold one of the spoons to a Jew, for 1 s., after breaking the mark off the top. He said if I had come a day later, he had got a ship and was going away.</p>
               <p>(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>
               <p>WOOTTON'S Defence. Hutley told the officer wrong. He was after me for a fortnight, and Toms did not go into the house.</p>
               <p>HUTLEY'S Defence. While I was helping a woman to move goods on Saturday, Wootton came up with a bag of tea, and asked me to go to Piccadilly with him, as he had a plan laid out; I said I would not, as I was moving goods; he said I should get much more by it, and I went with him. He said he had been nearly four hours gone with the tea, and expected to be turned away; and the best way was to get some money, and be off. I went with him on Sunday, as the officer said; he told me to crawl upon my hands and knees; I said he had better let me go out, he called me a coward, and gave me ten spoons to take out. Toms was waiting at a distance.</p>

A morocco box was in a drawer in my parlour, containing a lady's gold watch, a neck-chain, a seal, a key, and three rings, all gold. She dined with me on Tuesday, and I asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280015"/>her to do some needle-work; while she was doing it she said Mrs. West, who lived on the second floor, told her I had a gold watch. I took it out of the box, shewed it to her, put it back again, and did not see it afterwards. I missed it on Saturday, she was then gone. Before she went she gave me two 1 l. notes for her lodging; one of them had</p>
               <p>"Robson, No. 7, Duke-street, Mile End," on it. I went there, and in consequence of what I heard went to Robertson's, a pawnbroker, at the corner of Widegate-alley, Bishopsgate, and found every thing, except the rings. She lodged three weeks with us.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. You have many female lodgers - A. Not many; they are all females. I lived there twelve months before I was married - I have been married two years.</p>
               <p>Q. Your lodgers are visited by gentlemen - A. Yes. I did not know the prisoner till a week before she came to us, which was three weeks before the robbery. My maiden name was Taylor - I have gone by the name of Williams. I have lived with two gentlemen, and went by their names.</p>
               <p>Q. On your solemn oath, when you shewed the prisoner the watch, did you not desire her to pledge it -</p>
               <p>Witness. Am I to answer that question, my Lord?</p>
               <p>COURT. Most undoubtedly - A. I never did. I had redeemed it about a week before. I never said I directed her to pledge it. I had redeemed it not many weeks before.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What was your reason for asking whether you was to answer a question perfectly innocent - A. Because the gentleman seemed to ask such inconsistent things. I never did authorize her to pledge it.</p>

On Saturday, the 7th, in consequence of what my wife told me I went to Robson's, and on Monday went to Robertson's. I was obliged to pay away the notes I took of the prisoner. I found the property at Robertson's. My wife let the prisoner the lodging.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at her - do you mean to swear you have not known her some years - A. Not to my knowledge. I think I have some recollection of her about seven years ago living in Leonard-street - I visited her once there. I am not certain it was her.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, when she came to lodge with you, did you not recognise her as an old acquaintance - A. I said I thought I had seen her.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. How long before that did she say it had been done - A. It might be eight weeks ago. I understood her to say she had pledged it some months previous. She came to see me about once a fortnight, and I called on her when I went that way, to keep up a regular intercourse with her.</p>

I was ill in bed, and ordered my daughter, who is thirteen years old, to go to the drawer, and give me a pair of stockings, which I kept my money in - she brought the stocking, I took a note from the rest, and gave it to the prisoner - there was a 10 l. and seven 1 l. notes remaining. She stood at my bedside, saw me unroll the notes, and saw the drawer the stocking was taken from; it was in the same room and not locked; she saw it put back into the same drawer. I gave her a note, and told her Mrs. Nettleship might send me the change or not, as she liked. She went out, and came to work for me that, and the next week, as usual, and on the 6th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280016"/>March she came to beg a bit of starch for her cap. She knew I had to go to Brunswick-square, between twelve and one o'clock, to fetch linen. I went, leaving her in the house, alone, ironing her cap at a quarter before twelve o'clock. I returned in about an hour and a half, she was then gone; my little girl was then at home. I went to my drawer for money on the Thursday following, found the stocking unrolled, and the notes all gone. I missed one 10 l. and seven 1 l. Bank notes. She did not come to my house after that. She had told me she lived at No. 11, Edmond-street, Battle-bridge; I went there but did not find her. I enquired at different shops - a boy took me to No. 3, Paradise-place, Battle-bridge; I saw her bonnet hanging up, but Dudley, who kept the house, said she was gone to the Isle of Wight. I went with her to Button's, a pawnbroker, at Battle-bridge, who shewed me a 10 l. note. I do not know it myself, but Mr. Allingham is here, who paid it to me.</p>

She came on Friday or Saturday about three months ago, and said she had got a laundress's place to go to the Isle of Wight. She said on the following Monday, if they would not pay her passage back she would not go. She came in about eleven or twelve o'clock, and said they were willing to pay her passage, and had advanced her some money to redeem her things. She asked me to go with her to Button's, the pawnbroker. I went; she gave him some tickets, he said he could not give her change, she said she must go and get it. She had offered him a 10 l. note. She went out for change, returned, and said she could not get it, he then changed it for her. She told me she was going to return the change to the gentleman who gave her the money, but did not say where he lived. On Thursday Mrs. Green came to enquire about her. She had left my house on the Thursday morning. I took her to the pawnbroker's.</p>

            . On the 18th of October, about six o'clock in the evening, I was getting into the Fulham stage, on the west side of <placeName id="t18201028-31-crimeloc187">Dover-street</placeName>

I am certain it was the prisoner who snatched my watch - he was one of the crowd - they were returning from Hyde Park corner. I had a full view of his face, and saw the watch in his hand. I called Stop thief! pursued him about six yards, then got into the coach, and was informed he was taken. I found him in custody in a sadler's shop, not five minutes after. There was a very strong light. I am positive he is the man. I was very much hustled.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. It was dark - A. There were very strong gas lights in a shop. I saw him clearly, and saw it in his hand.</p>

            . I was in company with Read, close behind Mr. Filor - the sawyers were returning from Brandenburgh house - I saw the prisoner rush between him and Radauld, he put his left shoulder against Mr. Filor's right shoulder, and gave him a violent push. Supposing he had robbed him, I laid hold of him by the shoulder, and saw the watch pass; I believe it passed from his hand to another, who laid hold of it by the chain, it struck against a post, and the case fell off; the prisoner then got from my grasp, and was making off, when he saw the case on the ground, picked it up, and I secured him; my brother took it from his hand. I took him into a sadler's shop, Mr. Filor came in, and said he was certain he was the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. His back was to you - A. No; his side. The case was picked up not four feet from the place.</p>

            . I was holding the coach door for Mr. Filor to get in; as he put one foot on the step the prisoner rushed up, and with main force hindered him from getting into the coach, and in a moment I saw the watch pass from towards him to a man, who ran away with it - it hit against a post, and the case came off. I instantly grasped at the prisoner, but could not stop him. He picked up the case, I collared him, and took him into the sadler's.

On Wednesday night, the 6th of September, there was service in the chapel, I used one of the robes, there were three in the vestry. I had a writing-desk, with papers in it. I left the chapel about nine o'clock, Hawkins was there then - he keeps the key. The names of the trustees are rightly stated in the indictment.</p>

On this night I shut up the chapel, and locked every thing up. Next day, about five o'clock, I went and missed the carpet from the pulpit stairs, the Bible, writing-desk, and all the gowns were gone. No outer doors were broken open. I suppose somebody had concealed themselves there the night before. Mr. Reed's study door was broken open.</p>

            . I keep the John of Jerusalem, public-house, Rosamond-street. Bradman brought me the note, I marked it - (looks at it) - this is it. I returned with him, saw the prisoner there, and asked her it the note belonged to her? she said Yes. I asked her to step into the parlour, she did so. She said her name was Smith, and that she lived at No. 6, Vineyard-gardens. I said the note was forged, and proposed to send the lad to enquire - she said she would go and shew him, I said she need not trouble herself. He went, returned, and said he could find no such name. She wanted to go and shew me again. I proposed to send for a constable, she still said she lived there. Jordan was sent for; we went with the prisoner to Vineyard-gardens, she then said she lived at another place, and not at Vineyard-gardens; it was somewhere about Mutton-hill.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mutton-hill is not far off - A. It is not a quarter of a mile. She said she had lived in Vineyard-gardens about a fortnight.</p>

               <p>"No. 6, Love-court, Mutton-hill." I enquired there, but found no such person, I told her so; she said it was the first court on Mutton-hill on the left hand. I went there - it was Saffron-place, and found one Smith lived there, but could not learn whether he was her husband.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Mutton-hill is much occupied by lodgers - A. Yes. I knew her before, and know her name is not Smith.</p>

The passage door was shut and bolted, the prisoner's wife opened it, and exactly opposite that door is the room door, which was open, the prisoner was in bed.

I then searched the passage, and found, just opposite the bedroom door, the pannel was loose. I had a candle, as the passage was dark. On moving the pannel I found a small roll of black cotton, with eighteen 1 l. Bank notes in it, which I marked, these are them - (looking at them). I asked him how they came there? he said he knew nothing about them. Jeffries gave me a piece of black cotton from a table drawer in the prisoner's room.

            . On Thursday last, about a quarter before seven o'clock at night, I was walking down Southampton-street towards the Strand; I made a momentary halt at the corner of <placeName id="t18201028-47-crimeloc277">Tavistock-street</placeName>

I am positive he is the man. As soon as it was disengaged, he made a side movement, and as I thought, gave it to another person - his hat fell off, and he immediately ran away leaving his hat upon the ground. I followed him closely behind, calling Stop thief! and caught him myself immediately, before he had run fifteen yards. At that instant Congdon came up also, and seized him - it was just opposite a chymist's shop - we took him in there. He had only run across the street, and was not out of my sight. The watch was not found. My attention was fixed upon him, there might have been many persons near him, and I not see them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. LAW. Q. It was very dark - A. There was a lamp near. After he had got the watch out he pulled, and broke the steel chain which confined it. My hands were in that position that I could not resist; my right hand was twisted round my umbrella. I made no resistance, but the chain held the watch after it was out of my fob.</p>
               <p>Q. You was not under the slightest apprehension - A. I cannot say that.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Was there a considerable degree of force used to break the chain - A. There was, I felt a considerable pull; he broke it, I think, at the second jerk. There could have been time for me to have seized him, but my right hand held my umbrella. The lug occasioned no injury to my person.</p>

            ; my child is seventeen months old. On the 20th of September I was at work at my sister's in Widegate-street. About half-past eleven o'clock in the morning I sent my eldest boy down to mind the child; he returned in half an hour, ran up stairs to me, and said a woman had taken the child away. I ran as far as Shoreditch church to look after her, turned back, and when I got to Widegate-street the neighbours were all out. A person directed me to Rose-court, Spitalfields saying she had seen a child there that was lost. I went there and found my child there naked, with a white towel round it. A young man had picked it up in the ruins near Bell-lane. As I returned my boy came and said he had found the woman who took it with the clothes on her - they were the articles stated in the indictment, which it had on when it was lost. The shirt and spencer were left on it.</p>

            . I am ten years old; the child is my brother. I took him down by the pawnbroker's shop in Bishopsgate-street, and was holding it in my arms, the prisoner came, and asked to have a kiss of the child, I said she should not. She said,</p>
               <p>"I will take it away;" I said</p>
               <p>"You shan't, I will go and tell my mother." She pulled me back, knocked my head against the step of a door, pushed me down, and ran away with the child - she gave a boy a halfpenny to hold me down. I am quite positive she is the woman. I ran home, told my mother, and found the prisoner myself up an alley. I asked her where the child was? A lot of boys held her while I went to my mother. She said she had left the child with a woman while she cooked her husband's dinner.</p>

On the 18th of October, I went to bed between eight and nine o'clock at night, my doors and windows were all fastened. I rent a little common land; mine is a lone house, and stands on the common. About twelve o'clock or a quarter past, three soldiers burst into the house. I heard them burst the staple from the lock, and immediately jumped out of bed. They first came into the room where my son George and servant boy slept. I heard them say, they were come for the blunt, and the blunt they would have, or they would have our lives - I understood them to mean money. I heard them rumaging my son's room; they then came to my room door - both rooms are on the ground floor - I held the latch of my door as fast as I could. My wife said</p>
               <p>"Let them in," I did so, three of them came in, and demanded my money; I said we were poor people, and had none by us. One said to the other</p>
               <p>"Tie the cord round his neck, and keep him down." My wife said</p>
               <p>"For God's sake do not kill my husband!" they put this cord round my neck (producing it.) and pulled me up by it till I was almost strangled. My wife said</p>
               <p>"George, there is a 1 l. note in the little tin-box, in the chest of drawers, give it to them." George went to fetch it to give them, but they had got it before - I had seen the tin-box in their hands, and heard them knocking it about, but did not see them take the note - it was in my room. They were not satisfied with that, but went up to my wife's bed side, and ordered her out, she got out; they turned the bed down, and between the bed and mattress found four 1 l. notes, and 7 s. which I had put there for safety, about a fortnight before. They robbed the house of 25 lbs. of bacon, two dirty sheets one silk handkerchief, one waistcoat, pretty near a quartern loaf of bread, one piece of soap, and about 4 s., besides that with the notes. They staid in the house about twenty minutes or half an hour; when they left I looked out of the window, and saw them all in the yard, putting their soldiers' great-coats on - I saw by the light of the moon there were five of them in all, four came into the house, and another stood at the door - they had flannel jackets on in the house - they had no light except the light of the moon, which shone very bright in at the window - it was a very light night. I took particular notice of them, and can swear to the prisoner being one of the men who robbed my home, and who ordered the other to put the cord round my neck - I am quite certain of it - I never saw him before to my knowledge - he was in my sight ten minutes, and stood by me while the others plundered. I was very much alarmed, but am sure I am not mistakes. I heard his voice, and was not a yard from him - our room is very small - he is taller than the others. I cannot speak to them, but I am sure of him - he had a flannel jacket on, such as soldiers wear - I observed no other part of his dress. There are a good many soldiers quartered at Hampton and Hampton Court - he was quartered at Hampton Court - the constable and I took him there; we also took three other soldiers and a hostler, upon suspicion - he was discharged before the Magistrate, and the other soldiers put into the guard-house.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not swear the hostler was the man who put the rope round your neck - A. No, I did not swear to the hostler. The three soldiers were taken before the Magistrate. I said the prisoner was the man who ordered the rope round my neck, and he said if I did not not stand still he would blow my brains out. I swear to his features, as well as his voice - he stood by the side of the window, and the moon shone right into the room.</p>

            . I am the prosecutor's son. I was at home this night in the first bed-room with the servant boy, my father and mother were in the next room. I heard the door burst open, it awoke me - three men came tumbling into my room, and asked for the money? I said</p>
               <p>"I do not know of any money in the house, for sometimes we have not got sixpence." They said they had come for the blunt, and the blunt they would have, or they would have our lives. I called out to my mother, and asked if there was any money? she said No, they then went to her room. My father held the door sometime, and then opened it, they went in, and my father said</p>
               <p>"What do you want, my good fellows?" they said they came after the money, and the money they would have. I got out of bed, and went into the room with them. They rummaged about my father's room sometime, and kept asking for the money, and began to tie my father down. A little short soldier put the cord round his neck, and the tall soldier told him to tie him down, he seemed to be the commander of them. The short one had brought the cord with him - they put it about his neck, with a slip loop, and drew him up with their arms. My mother said,</p>
               <p>"Don't hurt my husband!" She was frightened, and told me to go to the little box in the drawer, and give them a 1 l. note. When I came to look it was gone out of the box, and the things rummaged about. They had got it before; the box was opened. There were spoons and things in it, which were not taken. There were also some bills pinned together, which they took out. As they went out they saw by the light in the kitchen that they were not notes, and threw them down. My mother got out of bed; they rummaged the bed and mattress, and took four 1 l. notes and 7 s. from between the bed and mattress, the other one was rummaging my room while the others were in my father's. They took about 4 s. from a box in my room. I know the one who stood in my father's room against the window, it was the prisoner. There were two tall ones, he was rather the tallest - he ordered the man to put the cord round my father's neck. I was close to him all the time they were in my father's room, which was ten minutes, or a quarter of an hour. I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280024"/>took particular notice of him, and am very positive he is the man. They all went out together. There were five of them when they got out, as I looked after them. They all appeared dressed alike, except one, who had white trowsers on - they had soldiers' clothes on. When they came into the room they seemed very tightly dressed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you present when the prisoner was taken - A. I came to the house when they had got two, and knew the prisoner instantly, he was in the guard-house. I afterwards heard him speak, and knew his voice. I have not a doubt of his being one of the men. When I looked out of the window they had got their soldiers coats on.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not say you could only swear to my voice - A. No. I said he was the very man before I heard him speak. I swear to his features.</p>

            . I am sergeant of the 21st regiment. The prisoner was a soldier in that regiment; we were quartered at Hampton Court inn - he slept in the same room with me. I remember the night of the 13th of October he did not sleep at his quarters that night - I am sure he was not there at nine o'clock. I did not see him till next morning at eight o'clock. I went to bed at nine - he did not come into the room that night - he could not without my knowing it - other soldiers slept in the room - he ought to have slept there. I heard him say he slept in the hay-loft over the stable.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. It is a large inn, and draws no beer. I stopped in the tap till eleven o'clock, and the house being shut up I went with the rest of my comrades, and slept in the hayloft. A man will swear that I was in my quarters at the time, but he is not here. I wish to ask the sergeant if the prosecutor did not take up a man who slept in the room with him that night.</p>

               <p>"I will go." In about two minutes I was assaulted by sixteen or twenty desperate characters, who cried out,</p>
               <p>"Tom, don't go; muzzle the b - g - rs, chiv 'em!" (which means to cut.) I was knocked down, and my head beat in a most dreadful manner. Marsh was rescued. As I was rising up again I was struck above my eye with something sharp, and was covered with blood. One of the girls lent me an apron, and that was soaked through immediately. I am sure Powers was one of them - I cannot say that he struck me. I saw Parsons the width of the street off. On recovering myself I saw Parry kicked and beat in a dreadful manner. I went to the doctor's, who dressed my head and gave me some stuff.</p>

I found a pair of sashes and some shutters there. I then searched Tetsall's house, and found six sashes and a piece of timber with Mr. Taber's name upon it, in the spirit-cellar; we found three mantle-pieces, and various other boards, which the prosecutor claimed. Tetsall called upon me, and expressed himself ready to attend before the Magistrate, which he did.</p>

This robbery was done while I was looking at the procession, I saw Coney and a number of people round the prisoner down Norfolk-street.

I saw him in particular attempt several gentlemens' pockets, and at the corner of Norfolk-street, I saw him and the prosecutor in the midst of about twenty - we could not get near enough to see him take the watch, but the prosecutor collared him, and said he had taken it. I and others rushed in, and got him a few doors down Norfolk-street; the prosecutor said</p>
               <p>"D - n you, you should not have given my watch away if it had not been for these glasses." He told us positively that he was the man who took it, and if we took him before a Magistrate, he would take his oath of it. We were knocked about terribly, and there was a desperate attempt to rescue him - the neighbours brought us out sticks to defend ourselves - we at last got him to the watch-house, and next morning, the prosecutor did not appear at the office. Mr. Birnie granted us two summonses, and a warrant to compel him. He told me he knew he was the man, but would not attend, and no Magistrate should make<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280027"/>him, if he did not think proper, and when he did appear, he refused to sign the book.</p>

I opened the door; he brought a great bunch of keys in his hand, and said he was sent to fit a key to a lock. I asked who sent him? he said he was sent by Mr. Extine, who was a smith, and lived in Gray's Inn-lane. I asked how Mr. Extine knew I wanted a key to a lock? he said Mr. Extine had seen my husband in the square and he had sent him. I looked at him, and said</p>

I said he night come and repair them on his own account, to put a shilling or two in his pocket - he went away; he was with me ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. I have no doubt of his being the man. On the 15th of October I went out about eleven o'clock, and left the articles stated in the indictment in the front and back parlours. I locked the doors, and took my servant girl, named Pearson, with me. I gave her the key and sent her home for some bread and cheese. I had a lodger named

            . I am near thirteen years old. I was servant to Mrs. Wells in last October, and went out with her the day the house was robbed. She sent me home with the key, I opened the door, and went into her room - it was near one o'clock; everything was then safe; the time-piece was on the front parlour mantle-piece. I locked the room door after me, and saw a man come down to the bottom of the one pair of stairs with a light coat on, I do not know whether it was the prisoner or not. I went out - I did not notice the front parlour door, as a door leads from the back room to it. Mr. Wells came home before I went out. I took the key to Mrs. Wells. The outer door of the house was only latched. The man asked me if Mrs. Wells was at chambers? I said Yes. He asked me to lend him a chair and a hammer; I got them out of the back parlour, and gave them to him, he returned them directly. I put them in again, and locked the door.</p>

            . On the 19th of August I was in the house in North-street, at work, when the officers came; Mr. Horsefall, the owner of the house, had employed me there - I saw the prisoner there. On the day before he had come, and told me he had taken the house of my master, and on the 19th he wanted to come in - he said he wanted to bring his goods in. He followed me up to Tottenham-street in the morning, said he had a load of goods, and wanted to have possession - this was on the 19th - he came to me, and said he wanted the key, he had a load of goods at the door. I said I had the key, but would not give possession till my master ordered me. I saw my master, opened the door, and let them put their goods in - the prisoner owned the goods, and helped to carry them in - it was then about nine o'clock; the house was empty before that. The officers came about four o'clock in the afternoon. I saw the prisoner there five minutes before - he had his coat off then. I did not see him go out, but he left his coat behind him.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. When did you see him again - A. Not till I saw him at Hatton-garden. I have been in the house every day since till now. He helped to carry the goods in - there were boxes and bedsteads. The officers found no man in the house, except one, who was at work. I was not there when they first came. I was gone for a ladder. They found a great many picklock keys and a crow in the two parlours, which the prisoner said he should occupy while the house was being done. I had a deal of conversation with him, and am sure he is the man.</p>

I knocked at the door on the second floor - they would not open it, but did at last. I went in, and found the two women, who were tried and acquitted the night before, with another woman and a man. I searched and found the prisoner under the bed, and took him out - he immediately began to fight to get from me. I got him to the head of the stairs, he held by the bannisters, they gave way, and we fell down stairs together - he made a violent resistance, and the persons with him assisted him. When I had locked him up I returned, and all the parties were gone. I found some skeleton keys there, and some in the privy.</p>

            . I was tried here last Session. The prisoner married my sister. I came from Edgware, and had been staying with her for two months before we were taken up. The table-cloth produced was my mother's - there is a darn in it which I did myself about six months ago, when I was in the country. My mother died about ten months ago, it was then given to me; I marked it with my sister's name before I left the country, and when I came to town I gave to her. I marked it six months before I gave it to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know anything of the time-piece - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Don't you - A. That time-piece was brought to me by a young man when I lived at New Haggerston - he kept me company for two years; he gave it to me about two months before I was taken up, which was on the 18th of August; I do not know what has become of him - he promised me marriage. I have not seen him since we removed to Pentonville. He brought a box to our house in Cross-street, City-road - he said it was full of china, and I was to take care of it till he called again; we moved to Pentonville next day, and took the box with us - he came there that day, and opened it, but I did not see into it - he put the time-piece into the box then; he was there when the officers came, about four o'clock, and got out of the kitchen-window.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did he open the box and put the time-piece in - A. At Cross-street; the box was not touched after it got to Pentonville till the officers came. I believe they found the time-piece in the box. I have not seen the man since.</p>
               <p>MR. BRODERICK. Q. What was his name - 
               <persName id="t18201028-66-person719">A. George Brown</persName>
            . When the officers came I said I knew nothing about the time-piece, that was not true. I was at Iron-monger-row when the prisoner was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he go quietly - A. He wanted his hat. I did not help him to resist; he did not resist, only wanted his hat; they pulled the banisters down in getting him away.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner at Pentonville when you was taken up - A. He breakfasted there in the morning. I will swear he was not there in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the man at the bar help East in with the goods - A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Will you swear he did not help to unload the cart - A. My brother; Yes, he did help, I did not know whom you meant.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You are not unacquainted with the bar, whom did you think was meant - A. The person who came with the cart.</p>
               <p>Q. The goods belonged to your brother - A. Part of them; there was a sofa which the young man brought me at Haggerston. I will swear the prisoner was not in the house after twelve o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did he not escape out of window, and leave his coat behind him, when they came - A. No; he went out in a blue coat I did not see the things found by the officer till they were produced at Hatton-garden.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did the young man put the time-piece in the box, when he had given it to you - A. He asked me for it.</p>
               <p>ROBERT EAST re-examined. The prisoner, his wife, and last witness, were at the house; there was not a soul came there besides her before the officer came, except my fellow-workman. I was putting a water shoot up in front of the house. Nobody could come in or go out without my seeing them.</p>

He came into the passage to abuse him again, my master shoved him into the tap-room, and he fell again, came out of the tap-room, and my master shoved him out of doors, he fell on his back upon the threshold; my master picked him up, and dragged him into the yard by the shoulders; he got up in about two minutes, and went into the street, about four houses off, and laid down there about an hour and a half.

A dispute arose - he was struck once only, that was with a fist on the breast - he was not hit on the head - he fell upon the ground, was picked up, and taken to the public-house, as he could not walk. I remained there with him, and left between two and three o'clock in the morning - he was insensible.</p>

            . I am a surgeon. I saw the deceased, he was brought to the London Hospital on Tuesday afternoon, about three o'clock, in an insensible state, remained so till that day week, and then died. He was wounded in the back of his head, it appeared to be made by an obtuse instrument - a fall against a table might have produced it - there were no external marks upon the body. I opened the head, and found a great deal of extravasated blood on the brain, which would produce stupor and insensibility. The injury on the head caused the extravasated blood, and that certainly caused his death.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. What time elapses after the injury before insensibility is produced - A. Sometimes two or three hours, but it is much sooner when there is a considerable extravasation of blood - it appeared a contused wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the wound to be given at two o'clock, would a man be about his ordinary business till night - A. If extravasation had not taken place - it does not always follow the blow immediately, the vessels are not able to emit the blood till the system recovers itself.</p>

            . I live at Bethnal-green. I was at the match, and saw Green knocked down with a stick, he was struck on the head with the stick. I had seen him fighting - I saw him before the match, he was intoxicated, but appeared well in health.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What part of the head was he struck on - A. I cannot say. I saw one blow given him on the back of his head, and he bled at the back of his head.</p>
               <p>MR. BAILLIE re-examined. I am certain there was only one external wound upon his head.</p>
               <p>Q. Supposing both these accounts to be true, as to his being apparently in perfect health at six o'clock, should you ascribe his death to the first blow given at two o'clock or to any subsequent blow - A. The blow at the back of his head caused his death. I am firmly of opinion that the blow given him in the morning caused the extravasation, if extravasation took place before the match, he could not have acted as described.</p>

In 1814 he shewed me a certificate of his marriage, on the coast of America. He said he was married, and that was the certificate of it; he said he had got it from his wife, and that was all he wanted. In June, 1815, when we came to Portsmouth, he told me he had heard his <rs id="t18201028-68-viclabel373" type="occupation">wife</rs>

               <p>Q. Do you remember seeing a man named Bone at your house a few months ago - A. Very probably I might, but I do not know him by name.

I saw her about twelve months after with a child. I saw the prisoner two or three times after. He called in the beginning of 1819, and asked if I had seen his wife? I said not since I saw him.

He told me there was a lady at the west end of the town, possessed of considerable property, if he could get married to her now, but he could not marry for two years, as his first wife had not left him five years. He said he left her for dead on the floor at Mrs. Stains's, in King-street, and had locked her in the room, and when he came home she was gone; that he went after her, and had sharpened his knife ready if he could have found her.</p>

Before her death I told the prisoner I should see about his previous marriage. He said he never had been married to any other woman but my sister. He afterwards confessed it, and asked for mercy. He had behaved very insolent, and next day he requested permission to see me and asked for mercy. I said,</p>
               <p>"How can you expect mercy, when you married a second wife, knowing your first was alive?" He then said he did not know whether she was alive or dead. My sister had about 2000 l. in the Bank, and other money - about 180 l. a year altogether. He said several<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182010280032"/>times he would give up the d - d business if I would allow him 40 l. a year. I said I would allow him nothing.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Your sister's money was left her by her mother at her sole disposal - A. Exactly so. I had no claim to it. She died about the beginning of March.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you employ a Mr. Pugh, an attorney - A. He wrote to the trustees in January, 1819, my sister was then alive, she died last March. I had some bills printed and circulated at all the sea-ports before her death.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Nebemiah - A. There was a man of that name who tuned my instrument. I never offered him 20 l. to swear the prisoner's first wife was alive. I do not believe I ever said a syllable to him about the business.</p>
               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. Solemnly on your oath you never did - A. I never did. My sister lived with the prisoner till her death - I could not separate them.

            . I am the prisoner's brother. Miss Lawes lived in my house at Woolwich. He was about to marry her - I only knew of his intent ten days before the marriage deed was executed. Before that I made diligent enquiry for his first wife of Mrs. Brooks and Jones, at his particular request. Miss Lawes knew he was a widower - it was occasionally a topic of conversation, for they were in my house a month before they were married. My brother told me his wife ran away from him in 1813. Miss Lawes was present at her sister's death.</p>

               <p>MR. ALLEY. Q. How long was that young lady in your house before he married her - A. About a month, and my wife had known her thirty years; in fact Miss Lawes was a tenant of mine some years ago. I made the enquiry about the years 1814 and 1815, not since. I never mentioned to Miss Lawes that my brother was about to marry her sister - they were acquainted about a month before they were married.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you know whether they agreed to marry at first meeting - A. They walked out daily.</p>

            . In 1815, I met her in the Borough; she said she was going to try to get in the hospital. I went next day, and saw her there, she had just expired - she was the same woman who married the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ALLEY. Q. Did not the prisoner lodge in the same house with you - A. Yes, in 1813, before his first wife died, he supported me - I lived with him from 1813 to 1816. I have been married two years.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Have you been to the nurse that attended her - A. She is not there - I have not been to see. I am sure it was 1815, because I was going to town at the time. I was at the marriage, but did not sign the register. She was in Magdalen ward - she was laying dead upon the bed. I told the prisoner I saw her dead - it was in the Summer of 1815.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever converse with Miss Lawes - A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. On your oath, did you ever tell her the prisoner's first wife was alive and at Plymouth - A. I did; but when I am on my oath I must speak the truth. It was a year and a half ago that I said so, and referred her to one Harris, who could give her information. She said she should send to Plymouth.</p>

I went down and examined the area door next morning; a hole had been bored at each corner of the pannel apparently by a gimlet; the moulding was split off one of the sides from one hole to the other - it appeared to have been done to move the pannel. The door leads from the area into the kitchen.</p>

            . I am watchman of St. Ann's. This house is in my beat. On the night of the 26th of October, as I was calling half-past one o'clock, I observed three men standing still outside Mr. Bell's house. When they saw me coming up to them, one man in a white coat went off, and the other two went different ways. I followed the man in the white coat a little way. I walked round the square, and on coming to Mr. Bell's house again, I saw the same man there; he stood in the front of the area, walked away, and I followed him to the corner of Frith-street and down the left side as far as No. 3; he stopped there about a minute, and turned back towards Greek-street. I turned back to the corner of Carlisle-street, and then went back to Mr. Bell's area, stood there about a minute, and heard some person at work down the area, apparently cutting wood - the moon shone very bright. I drew alongside the area, and saw a man there at work, and on getting my rattle from under my coat; the man in the white coat (who was outside) came up, and asked me what it was o'clock? I said it was almost two; he instantly seized my rattle and broke the large part off, which prevented my springing it. I said there was somebody down the area; he said</p>
               <p>"D - n your b - dy eyes, I'll area you." Another man stepped up instantly, and broke this broomstick over my head. When they saw that the blow made me stagger off the footpath, they called to the man in the area</p>

               <p>"Come up." He came up through the area gate, which was open, went along the top of Frith-street, and down the left hand side; the other two went different ways. I followed the man towards Frith-street, calling Stop thief! Thorn, the watchman, attempted to stop him. I was about twenty yards off at the time, and never lost sight of him at all - it was the prisoner. When I came up, Leager had got him - he had passed the place where Thorn attempted to stop him. As he ran down Frith-street, I heard him throw something down, which sounded like keys. I went to the watch-house with him, and in the way he dropped a small chisel; I picked it up and gave it to Healing. I went back to Frith-street with Ivory and Mason; we found a bunch of keys exactly in the same spot where I heard him throw them - Ivory picked them up. I tried them to Mr. Bell's area gate, one of them locked and unlocked it. I afterwards saw the door, if the pannel had been cut out, there would have been room enough to let a man's body through. Thorne went to the watch-house all over blood - he was cut along his forehead. I never lost sight of the prisoner till he was taken.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you observe what was done to the door - A. There were four gimlet holes in it, and where the pannel is let in, was cut all down and nearly cut away.</p>

            . I am watchman of St. Ann's Westminster, my beat is on the west side of Frith-street, and the corner of Queen-street. On the night of the 26th of October, I heard the cry of Stop thief! and immediately crossed the way, hearing the footsteps of a man running towards me as hard as he could; it was the prisoner. I lifted up my stick, and called to him to stop, he was close to me, he said nothing, but lifted up his hand and made a blow at me, which nearly staggered me. I felt that it was the blow of an instrument, and the blood gushed from me in a torrent immediately. He then ran off as fast as he could, I followed him, springing my rattle, as hard as I could, and crying Stop thief! I did not lose sight of him, and saw Leager stop him. When I came up he had got him by the collar. I immediately took him by the other side, he was taken to the watch-house. My head was dressed - I received a cut across the temple. I am certain he is the man.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had you your hat on when you received the blow - A. Yes; my cap was under my hat, the blow was below where the hat came, my cap was not down, it prevented my hat coming on my head. He struck me with a sweeping cut so - (describing it.)</p>

            . I am house-surgeon at Middlesex Hospital. Thorn was sent to me by Mr. Bell. I saw him at six o'clock in the evening, he had a wound about an inch and a half long, extending across the forehead, it appears to have been made with a knife, the one produced, it strikes me, was very probably the instrument. It was all the same depth, and began about three inches from the eye-brow on the left temple.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was it any depth to make it dangerous - A. The skull was not exposed, it was a little less than a quarter of an inch deep. It must have been done by a cutting instrument. I have not a doubt of its being a cut, and not a contusion.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was coming down Frith-street, and that man stopped me. I made no resistance. I live in Crown-street, and was not above twenty yards from home.

            , the prisoner was in my service up to the 15th of August. It was his duty to receive pledges, and enter them on the book. On the 6th of October a lady applied to me to redeem a gold watch, which had been pledged for 5 l. I found the counterpart of her duplicate on a watch in my hand-writing. I had put it on a gold watch. On opening the paper I found this silver watch, which I had seen in the prisoners bed-room as a wearing watch. Before he left I had missed other articles when persons came to redeem them, and he knew I obtained great discredit and injury by not having them to produce.</p>

            . I am an officer. I went with Mr. Aldous to the prisoner, shewed him the silver watch, and asked if he knew it? he appeared at first not to know it. I said I was aware he knew it, he then said he did, that it had been his, and he had substituted it for a watch which he then had in his pocket. I said, No, he substituted it for a gold watch, which he denied. I found some keys on him, which he said belonged to his writing desk, and the bureau at his father's house, I said I was going to search his father's house for the gold watch, he then asked to speak to Mr. Aldous alone, Mr. Aldous refused. He then said,</p>
               <p>"It is of no use denying it, you will find the gold watch in my desk at my father's." I did so. He then threw himself on the prosecutor's mercy, and said he had robbed him.</p>

A crowd came up behind, they all hustled me, and snatched my watch from my fob. A person behind held my arms - the man who took it ran down Gun-street. I ran a few yards after them, and was knocked down or tripped up. I received a blow with a bludgeon on the back of my head, which deprived me of my senses. When I recovered myself Wells said he knew two or three of them, but I knew none of them myself.</p>

On the 9th of October I was playing about, and saw a gang of fifteen or twenty parading up and down Union-street - they stopped at the corner of Gun-street. Mr. Morgan was walking rather slowly; two or three of them came in front of him - I then saw them all run down Gun-street; he followed them, was knocked down, and received a severe blow on the back of his head. As they ran away I saw the watch in Grew's hand by the gas-light. They all ran away, calling out,</p>

            . I saw Wells in Gun-street. Pinnock and Potts were with us playing at hoop. A mob surrounded a gentleman; I did not see the prisoners among them. At the time Morgan was knocked down Wells was at the corner of Steward-street with me, fifty yards off; I could see as much as him. As he returned from Worship-street that night he said he was promised 50 l. for every one he should hang, and 5 s. a day for attending the Old Bailey. I said</p>
               <p>"John, how could you swear to the two young men, when you was at the corner of Steward-street at the time?" He said,</p>
               <p>"Oh you fool! I shall have 50 l. for every one I hang - I will pick out two, and say they were them that robbed the man." Pinnock reckoned up 5 s. a day, and made 3 l. 10 s. for fourteen days. He said,</p>
               <p>"There is a fine speck!" Next day I met him with about twenty officers. I followed him through several streets, he then parted from them, and came to me and Pinnock. He called me aside, and said Morgan had promised him 2 s. 6 d. next morning. I met him on Saturday morning in Widegate-alley. He had seen Mr. Grew talking to me. He said,</p>
               <p>"Well, Ned, what did they get out of you yesterday?" I said,</p>

On the 4th of October, about four o'clock in the morning, I saw the prisoner at the corner of Old Compton-street and Wardour-street, he was bulky behind; I stopped him, and asked what he had got? I found 30 lbs. of lead under his coat - it appeared to be fresh cut, and was part of a gutter. On Monday I compared it with No. 20, Frith-street, it fitted the gutter on the roof. I am certain it belonged to the gutter.</p>

            . I was painting Mr. Meadow's stairs, about half-past five o'clock in the evening I opened the street door to give me light. Soon after two people came, and asked if any shavings were wanted. I said ring the bell, and you will be answered. They came farther into the passage, and requested me to go and ask the servant, which induced me to turn my head round, and seeing them in the middle of the passage, I said if they did not ring the bell I must shut the door, as it was opened for my convenience. They rang, and were answered from the area. Presently another person came, and enquired for the housekeeper, I told her to ring, but on turning round I saw one of the two in the passage who came before with the same basket of shavings; he went away very nimbly. I kept working on, and in a few minutes after that, I saw something cross the light behind me, and saw one of the prisoners with the coat in his hand going out. I called to him, he dropped the coat on the steps of the door. I immediately ran after him, called Stop thief! He was stopped in Berkeley-square, without my losing sight of him. An officer stopped him. It was Smith.</p>

            . On the 22d of September, about half-past five o'clock I and Lee were coming across Berkeley-square, and saw the prisoner in conversation with another, about four doors from Mr. Meadows's. We went to the Running Footman, public-house, opposite. Lee was in the tap-room, and I up stairs. Before I got to the window, I heard the cry of Stop thief! I stopped Weller with the basket in his hand.</p>

I went in, and saw the prisoners and another person there, but having seen Watts before, I did not suspect them. Soon after another person came and desired me to have an eye on them, as they were bad characters. A short time after being engaged in the bar, I saw a person pass, and on looking through the window I saw King making his escape out of the house with something under his coat. I pursued, tapped him on the shoulder, and said I suspected he had a mug under his coat, he replied he had nothing more than these silk handkerchiefs - (producing four). - I went in doors looked through the window again, and saw there was still a large bulk under his coat. A butcher then came and said he had stolen the handkerchiefs from the yard. I then pursued and brought him back, with the four handkerchiefs under his coat, and gave him in charge.</p>

When I mounted my horse it turned restive, and having the mace in my hand I could not govern it. Mr. Irish, one of our trustees desired me to give it to him. The prisoner was then riding in front of the carriage, he said to Mr. Irish,</p>
               <p>"Give it to me, I can take better care of it outside," which he did. I left, and went in front of the procession. When we got home, we stopped at the Britannia in the New-road, and could find neither the prisoner nor the mace. It was silver, and worth 10 l. He was apprehended on the 6th of October.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. Have you heard it was taken from him - A. No; It had the name of the parish engraven on it.</p>

            . I had the care of this house on the 9th of October, about one o'clock in the day, everything was quite safe - this lead was fixed to the cistern and sink. About eleven o'clock at night Cox alarmed me, I went and found it cut from its place, and lying in the kitchen in four pieces - the back door was forced open. About a week before that the prisoner, Thompson, had called and looked the house over.</p>

            . I am a watchman. One end of my beat comes into Banner-street. Cox called me over to him, I went to the door of No. 28, and saw a light in the kitchen. Cox called Ward up, and I saw the two prisoners come out of the back door of the house into the court. I took Thompson, Beckett ran back into the house - I saw him in the custody of Daniels; I am sure he is the man. We went into the house, and found four pieces of pipe cut from the sink. Some matches were found on both the prisoners.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I observed a light at No. 28, Banner-street, which was an empty house. I called Grenville, and knocked at the door three or four times - no answer was given. I went towards the next door, and the moment I knocked the prisoners came from the back door; we seized Thompson, and Beckett retreated into the house. Before I could spring my rattle he came out of the front door; Daniel seized him, he fell down in the kennel; I immediately secured and took him to the watch-house. I returned to the house, and found the lead on a table, and a crowbar on the copper. One match, partly burnt, was found on Thompson, and nine or ten on Beckett. At one o'clock I found a skeleton key in the court, and at two I found a dark lanthorn, with a wax candle in it, two or three yards from the back door. The lead was fresh cut, and weighed 30 lbs.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. BRODERICK. Q. You could not see the back door - A. Yes. They said they went up the court for a necessary purpose, but I had seen them lurking about the house before ten o'clock.</p>

            . I am an officer. On the 20th of October, between five and six o'clock in the evening, I was in my shop in Church-lane, Strand; some boys passed - somebody came in and said they suspected them, I followed them, they all ran away except the prisoner, who went into No. 4, Church-lane, with this grating. It is an old-iron shop. I took him with it, I fitted it to the house.</p>
