I took him before Justice Keniston; there he was searched, and the rest of the goods were found upon him. He said he had the bolts of his brother in the country, that made them. I sent the mark upon the bolts to several ironmongers, but found no owner. The prisoner told me he worked with Mr. Hill in Pannier Alley; I sent to him, who said he traded with Mr. Martin in Foster-lane, and he thought they might belong to him: the next morning he brought Mr. Martin, who owned them.</p>

               <p>G. Foster. I will tell the truth. On the 8th of June I went to get change for a quarter guinea; they could not change it at the ale-house; the prisoner said he could change it; he took his money out, and had but a shilling and two or three halfpence; he said, My dear, I'll give you change: he had hold of my hand; he took the money out of my hand, and gave me the paper it had been in again: I said, The money is not here: the prisoner said, Yes, my dear, it is, and walked with me as far as Benjamin-street; then he spit in his hand, and ran away. I called, Stop thief, and he was stop'd in Red-lion-street: I saw the quarter guinea afterwards, in Mr. Watkins's hand.</p>

            . Some time, in the beginning of June last, I was in Red-lion-street, and heard the people call stop thief: I saw the prisoner come running at the front of a mob: I took hold of his collar, and bid him stop; he told me the thief was gone before: I told him I should hold him till the people came up; which I did: the child came among the rest, and said, that was the man that had taken the quarter guinea from him. Mr. Watkins took hold of the prisoner, and took him into a public house; the prisoner at first denied knowing any thing of the matter; saying, he had no such piece, and offered to be searched; but upon farther discourse, he confessed he had taken the quarter guinea from the boy, and directed Mr. Watkins to go to the place where I stop'd him: Mr. Watkins went out, and soon returned with the quarter guinea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Watkins. About the 8th of June I was in Red-lion-street; hearing a great noise about a thief, I went and took hold of the prisoner; we took him to a public house; he denied having the quarter guinea: where was a person there belonging to Bridewell, that knew him, who said he was discharg'd from there the night before: then the prisoner acknowledged he had taken it, and sent me to the place where he was stop'd; there I found it.</p>

             is my mother; the prisoner had no business there at all: I bid her go out, and forewarned her from taking any thing with her: the fire began about 11 at night: we were told the next morning, that the prisoner had been offering things to pledge; the fire was on a Saturday, and we took her upon the Monday following. I heard her acknowledge she took a parcel of things in a sheet, and pitched them in the alley, and after that got assistance to carry them to her house: upon taxing her, she took the officer and I to Rag-fair, to a house where she had offered the quilt to sale, and they stop'd it: she asked for it, and the people produced it: she had pawned a pair of sheets at one Jones's, in Old Gravel-lane, for five shillings: he at first denied having them, but when he found we should search, he produced them. (The quilt and streets produced and deposed to.)</p>

I said, Go along with me to him, and after that I'll buy it. He said, Let me go, and I'll find him. I said, You shall not go without me. I took him to Clerkenwell: he was there examined; he still could not find the man he bought them of. He was examined again, two days after; he could not give any other account. He sent for Mr.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100007"/> Basset, his master; he not coming, but sending a letter to the Justice.

            . There was a boy with sore eyes came to me, with three hats in his apron, then the prisoner, he came with some linen; I think it was on Whitsun-Tuesday.</p>
               <p>Wright. That was the linen mentioned in the first indictment.</p>
               <p>Court. Why was you not here to give your evidence on that trial?</p>
               <p>E. Boyd. I did not know of it till the afternoon; then I came, and they would not let me in. I told the boys I had not silver enough to pay for the things, but would go and get change for a guinea: I went to Mr. Wright's house, in order to have them secured; they knowing his house, ran away: I stop'd all the things.</p>

            . About twenty minutes after two in the morning on the 16th of June, we detected Spinosoe, a Jew, with a sack of pease on his back: I asked him how he came by the pease? - I don't know. - Where do you come from? - I don't know. - Who employed you? - I don't know. - I said, You must go to the Compter. He said, I am a very honest man: three men came and asked me to carry it, and said they would give me a shilling, and they had his hat; he had none on. In about a quarter of an hour the prisoner and another man came to us; he said the other man's name was Jones: they came from East-Smithfield way, which was quite a different way from that Spinosoe came. When the other man knew they were pease, he said he was a custom-house officer; if they had been worth any thing, he would seize them: then the prisoner and he went away again.</p>

            . I am the master of the barge the pease were worked in; she lay at Queenhithe. On the 16th of last month, my man told me there was a sack missing; and on the 17th the watchman and constable came to Bear-key, and told me they had taken a man with a sack of pease: the sack was Hornblow's. We took Spinosoe before my Lord Mayor; he swore Walters was one of the men that employed him to carry them. My Lord committed him for farther examination. Walters was taken on the Sunday, about eleven in the forenoon, by the description that Spinosoe gave of him. Spinosoe said there were four more concerned.</p>

               <p>Humphry Pugh. As I, my wife, and little boy, were going home on the 9th of last month, going through St. Paul's church-yard, it had just struck 12 o'clock: there were a parcel of young fellows and women of the town quarrelling; we past them, and said nothing to them, nor they to us: I believe the prisoner came from them: I did not see him till we came to the Mansion-house; then he was sometimes by my side, and sometimes by my wife's side, and sometimes a yard before us: I suspected him to be a pick-pocket. When we came a little beyond the end of <placeName id="t17650710-20-crimeloc102">Devonshire-street, in Bishopsgate-street</placeName>

I can't say he asked for my money. I said, Hey! Hey! what is all this? My wife said, For God's sake don't let it off; I'll give you all I have, I thought it a shame to be robbed by such a little urchin as he. (The prisoner appeared not to be above 14 or 15 years of age.) I rush'd upon him, and trip'd up his heels; he threw his hand back, and fell against the side of a house; he recovered himself, and took to his heels, with the pistol in his hand: I ran after him; my wife called, Stop thief, and I the same: a watchman met us, and took him: he was never out of my sight: the watchman took this pistol out of his pocket; ( produced in court) it was charged: he was taken to the watch-house; the constable asked him who he belonged to? he answered. What was that to him? and would give no answer.</p>

I said, I'll take you to another shop. I considered he was very young, and I was sorry to take him before the Justice: I told him, if he would tell me what other things he had taken, I would let him go about his business; he declared this was the first thing he ever did, and wish'd he might die if he did any other thing. I took him before Justice Welch, and told the Justice I thought he had robb'd me of something else. I told the Justice, as he was young, I intended to take him home, and give him a little dressing, and let him go. The Justice seemed agreeable: I took him home, and did so, and sent him about his business: the next morning I got up and look'd over the shelves, and miss'd two pair of leather breeches, and a pair of cloth breeches: I went to Justice Welch, and told him my suspicions of the mother: he granted me a warrant to take up the boy. Before I took him before the Justice, I ask'd him if he would tell me what he had done with my leather breeches; he would not acknowledge any thing. I took him before the Justice; there he would not own to any thing. After he was committed, the runner ask'd me to give him something to drink. While we were drinking, he began to talk to the boy: he told him he would take his hand-cuffs off, and he should be indulged in the prison all in his power, if he would tell the truth: at last he said he would tell him when he came to prison. No, said the runner, you had better tell me now; then he told me he had stolen two pair of leather breeches, and they were pawned in Oxford road for 9 s. He and the runner went for them, and brought them. I described them before they were opened, and I swore to them before Justice Welch. (Produced in court.)</p>

She staid five or six weeks after my wife died, which was on the 20th of December, at which time my sister came to keep my house; the mother staid in the house till April following. The prisoner went away the 12th of January, and I desired her mother that she never might enter my door again. She went from my house to a person that keeps the Weavers Arms, an alehouse in Spittalfields: he having two club-boxes in his house, which were robb'd of a good deal of money, he came to me, and ask'd me if I had not lost things. This was in the month of May. Then I read him the list of things I had lost. He told me she had a pair of window-curtains in his house: I show'd him the curtains on my bed, the same of two window-curtains I had lost; he said them he had seen were the same; upon which I took a warrant against her. I lost also a pair of work'd ruffles: I have found part of them made up into a cap. I lost all the things mentioned in the indictment, and more.</p>

            . When the prisoner came first out of the country, through a relation of her's, I took her in, which was about two years ago. She was backwards and forwards at my house often: she came from the prosecutor's to my house some time about Christmas. After my house was robb'd, which was on the 3d of May, (she was a lodger<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100013"/> then with me) she told me, when I saw her flush of money, her uncle had sent her up 17 l. and that the prosecutor had changed the bill for her. I went to him; he said he had not chang'd any bill for her: he said he had been robb'd the time her mother and she were there, and he had great reason to suspect her: he mentioned to me the things he had lost, window-curtains, sheets, ruffles, spoons, and a large candlestick. I seeing his bed-curtains, I came home, and told my wife they were of the same that the prisoner had work'd up into a quilt. I saw the rings upon them before she cut them off.</p>

            . My husband told me of the bed-curtains he had seen at the prosecutor's house: I went there, and am certain those two curtains that she had work'd up into a quilt in my house were the same pattern and cloth. When she was joining the quilt together, she said she had them from her grandmother out of the country. When we search'd her house we found the quilt; but the border made of the curtains was taken off. I ask'd where the red and white border was; she said, if we wanted them, we might go and look for them. (Two bed-curtains produced, brought by the prosecutor.) The curtains I saw the prisoner work up into a quilt in our kitchen, were the fellow to these, of the same chintz pattern, a particular fine cotton.</p>

Yes, said I, I will do that: I did; then I thought I had a right to lie down. I had 7 guineas and a half, and 6 s. in silver, tied up in a corner of my handkerchief, which I had about my neck: I lay down, and put my handkerchief under my head; I don't think she lay down; they had felt, and knew I had money about me; I was pretty far gone in liquor; I heard my money fall off the bed, and I believe she heard it too; but I thought it was safe. In the morning I awak'd about a quarter before four, and look'd about the floor for my money: I saw my handkerchief lying at the foot of the bed, and the money all gone: I thought it time then to make a report: not one of the women was in the room: I went down stairs, and made a report to

I told her she had robb'd me of seven guineas and a half, and 6 s. She put on her cloths immediately, and went out to look for her. I desired her to secure her, and keep her fast till she sent for me; she said she would. I said, I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100014"/> will stay in the house till you come with an answer from her. She came again a little after five o'clock, Sir, said she, I have been over to the White Hart in the Borough; her name is Essa Morrison; she was seen going over London-bridge, and is gone down to Portsmouth. I said I would write down there, and have her adververtis'd and find her if in England. By looking about, I found Morrison at the Ship, one Anderson's, in East-Smithfield. As soon as I saw her, she said, There is the cull that I robb'd; I wish it had been a thousand pound. The constable was with me. I took her up: she was search'd, but not at that present time; there was 12 s. 6 d. and a ring, found in a box upon her. We took Waller in the afternoon about four o'clock; she came to her home in a coach, with a bundle of new cloaths that she had bought. Morrison told me before Justice Scott, at the Angel in Whitechapel, that she gave her two guineas in gold, and Waller answered it was but 25 s.</p>

The man immediately came up a second time to the coach, presented a small pistol, and said he wanted our money. Major Smith, I believe, gave him some silver, and he collected money from two of the ladies, and a green purse, with about 6 s. 6 d. or 7 s. in it, from me. Among this money were three or four sixpences. One of the ladies delivered to him a green purse, and three or four shillings in it. After that he rode back. There was nothing over his face, as well as I could see at that time of night; and I have seen him several times since. I do believe the prisoner is the man. I don't swear positively he is the man. I gave a description of him before I saw the prisoner again, and that description answer'd.</p>
               <p>Major Smith. I can only confirm what Captain

             has said. The person was so close: to me, I can be as positive the prisoner is the man that robb'd us, as I can be positive to my own person. I talk'd with him: he told me, when leaving the coach, that distress drove him to do it.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it light or dark?</p>

            . I was by the barracks at Kensington-gate, and heard the cry Stop thief. This was on a Saturday night, about the hour of ten, the same night this robbery was committed. The prisoner came up on a gentle trot to the gate; he desired the man to open it; he did not open it immediately: there came two men galloping up the park, hallooing out Stop thief; I ran to meet them; the prisoner turned about, and I seiz'd his horse's bridle; he ask'd me what reason I had to stop him; I told him I thought he was a highwayman; he said, Let the horse go; I said I would not; he struck me several times with his whip: he finding I would not quit his horse, he jump'd down and left him, and ran away. I ran after him; he jump'd from the road to the greensward; I jump'd after him, and seiz'd him; then he said he would surrender to me.</p>

               <p>Q. What colour was the horse?</p>
               <p>Wood. The horse was a bright bay, with a small star in his forehead; he was very sweaty; he appeared to have been rode hard.</p>

The gentleman went no farther than the gate; my fellow-servant went in first; he said the man was coming from Kensington mounted. When he saw us, and heard us call a highwayman, he turn'd and went towards Kensington. I did not see him after till this light-horseman, Wood, was running after him. I met them both running on foot.

            . I am servant to Mr. Hall, a riding-master. I was returning from Kensington Gravel-pits with Stoaks towards Knightsbridge. Kensington-gate was shut. There came a gentleman up with a black horse with a bald face from Kensington; he said he heard there was a highwayman in the park, and desired us to go with him. They would not let us go through Kensington gate. We both went with him: we rode on to Hyde-Park Corner gate, and bid the gate-man shut the gate, for there was a highwayman in the park. Just at that time the man came riding up from towards Grosvenor-gate upon a gallop. There was hallooing out towards Grosvenor gate of a highwayman; they halloo'd after him Stop thief. I and my fellow-servant went after him towards Kensington gate: we came up to him just as the light horseman took him on the greensward; they were both on foot.

As we were going towards our horses, we met a man mounted; we desired him to ride to Hyde-Park gate, and order the man to shut it, while we got our horses ready.

               <p>Mr. Carver. I have been acquainted with him upwards of twelve months, and have had dealings with him; he always behaved just and honest; I never heard any thing amiss of him in my life.</p>
               <p>Mr. Webb. I have known him between two and three years; I never heard a syllable amiss of him.</p>
               <p>Mr Draper. I have known him about eighteen or nineteen months; I have recommended him to sell horses; he is a very sober, honest man.</p>
               <p>Mr. Stevens. I have known him more than four months; his character is that of an honest man.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Elliot. I have known him going on four months, or better; he is a very honest, sober man. I never heard to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Q. to Wood. How was the prisoner dress'd when you took him?</p>

            . After my meat was taken away from a cool place where I had hung it to keep, in the night, on the 5th of last month, I found some of the fat of the mutton near the door where the prisoners lodged; and after the boys were in custody, I put Laurence's foot into the print of a foot in the mould in my garden, and it fitted exactly. He then said he would tell me where my meat was. He took me over the Ruins of St. Giles's, and went up into an old uninhabited house; there was my meat under the roof of the house: he gave an account that Fluty and Williams were concerned. I took them both up. When before Justice Welch, the Justice would not admit him an evidence, but admitted Williams, who is very young.</p>

I took her up at a house opposite the Coach and Horses; and the watch was found upon her. (Produced and deposed to). I never saw her but once before in my life.</p>

I have been journeyman to Mr. Watts seven years: I was at dinner at the Griffin in Long-lane, on the 11th of June; going from thence to our shop, I saw the prisoner coming out of it; I said, William, what have you in your pocket, you seem to be loaded very heavy? Andrew, said he, I want to speak with you; he took me into a stable near the shop, and begg'd of me not to tell Mr. Watts, and delivered the iron out of his pocket to me; it was horse-shoes; I don't know how many there were, but they weighed twelve pounds three ounces. I said, it did not signify begging, for as soon as I saw my master I should tell him, which I did. I took the prisoner to the Griffin, and left him in the care of my fellow-servant till I got a constable and charged him.</p>

About eight or ten minutes; when they came back again, they asked me for the other men; I said they were gone; then the prosecutor swore an oath, and said he was robb'd of his watch and two half guineas; and took the prisoner by the sleeve, and said he had snatched them from him, and had delivered them to another man, and he would not go out of the house without his watch: then the prisoner said, Come along, and they never went into a room, but went out together.</p>

I went and returned about two in the afternoon: I found the door between his room and mine open; he was gone, and seven guineas, a gold-ring, and a watch: they were taken out of of a box which was locked when I went out: I met him by accident in the Strand. I took him up, and charged him with taking the things: he told me he had pledged the watch at Windsor, where I went and found it. I took him before Justice Welch; he there confess'd to taking all the things; he said he gave another man part of the money. (The watch produced and deposed to.)</p>

               <p>Q. Did the prisoner tell you his name?</p>
               <p>George. He told me his name was Holloway, and that he lived at Hampstead; I kept her near five weeks, then I sold her; and I believe it was about three months after that, that I saw her in the possession of Mr. Morris.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that mare which Mr. Morris had is the same that you bought of the prisoner?</p>
               <p>George. I am sure she is the same.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe her.</p>
               <p>George. She had a small matter a star in her forehead; one of her feet had a few white hairs.</p>

               <p>I did not deal with Mr. George for that mare. In the latter end of November I bought a mare going down into Wales; on my return I swaped her with a man on the road, but not this mare. I know nothing of the matter. I gave 6 l. or 6 l. 10 s. for that I bought.</p>

            . The prisoner was my servant some time: I never was more surprized in my life than when I heard of this: he came to me on the 8th of November, 1756. I had a very good character of his honesty and sobriety from the gentleman he lived with before; and at the latter end of the year 1757, I went to Bath, and not having occasion for his service, I discharged him. At my return from Bath, I quitted my house at Hampstead; he desired me to recommend him to the gentleman, my successor, as a gardener: I did, and he was behaved very honest. The little place I had was in his care. The gentleman that took my house left it some time after, and the prisoner came to me, and desired me to recommend him to my Lady

            . I went to her since, and enquired of her whether he deserved that good character: she let me know the man had behaved well in her service, and she looked upon him as an honest man: and when she discharged him she recommended him to another successor in her house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Say. I have known him ten years; he was a servant to me as a gardener: during that time, which was about two years, he behaved always as a faithful honest servant, such as I would now admit into my family, did I want.</p>
               <p>Q. How long has he left your service?</p>
               <p>Mr. Say. He has left it about ten years.</p>
               <p>Mr. Renshaw. I have known him five or six years. I live at Hampstead; he lived there in the capacity of a gardener; I have known him in several families there; I have trusted him in my garden and house since Christmas for three weeks at a time; I never knew him to be dishonest; he is a hard labouring man; I never heard any body give him a bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a housekeeper?</p>
               <p>Mr. Renshaw. He was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever keep horses?</p>
               <p>Mr. Renshaw. I never knew him to have a horse in his possession in my life.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you remember what time he went into the country.</p>
               <p>Jones. He went down about Christmas.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. I went down into Wales, and bought a mare at a place called Tarney. She fell lame, and I changed with this man: she cost me 6 l. 10 s.</p>

               <p>Lady Effingham. I had the key; I was there the day before the robbery, the 17th; I believe there might be about threescore pounds in guineas and half guineas, two half crown pieces, and a silver groat, in the bureau; some of the money was in the purse, I believe; (two half crowns put into her hand) I had such as these in the bureau; one I had a great while, but cannot be certain there are they. (Two bags produced) These are mine, which the money was in, in the bureau: my maid came and told me the room was on fire; I got dress'd, and out of my room as soon as I could. I found, when they brought the bureau out, the back of it was burnt, but the front was not burnt. The lock was very difficult to open, and it appeared to have been cut where the bolt snot, in order to open it; t hat I imagine to have been done before it was set on fire; after the fire I searched to see what money was taken out, and found it gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you keep that bureau always locked?</p>

            . I lived with my Lady Effingham Howard at the time of this robbery: I was awaked by the alarm of fire; the prisoner rung the bell at the bottom of the stairs: I went down and saw him at the bottom of the stairs, just by the fire; he was drest as he was the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the night was that?</p>
               <p>Catlin. This was a little after three o'clock; he had his black stock about his neck: he went by me, and he shewed me where the fire was, with his shoes and every thing on he had the night before, with his stockings tied up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he used to appear flush of money?</p>
               <p>Catlin. No, he did not, he borrowed money of me, a shilling at a time.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before the fire?</p>
               <p>Catlin. About a fortnight or three weeks before the fire. I had directions to search the wall in the garden about a week before the fire, on account the maid-servants had told me and others, that the prisoner told them he had seen three men in the garden; I went to look, and saw no print of feet, or any thing. I searched the borders, which are soft ground; if people had come over there, there must have been the print of their feet.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. How long was it after I rang the bell before you came down stairs?</p>
               <p>Catlin. It might be five or ten minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. from Prisoner. Where did you go when you went down stairs?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I asked him where the fire was; he said it was in her Ladyship's back parlour; I begg'd him to shut the door: the smoak came out very much; I ran out into the yard, to see if the place was open, and after that her Ladyship sent me to St. James's.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you dress yourself before you came down?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I put most of my things on first.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the prisoner was searched?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I was; I saw six guineas in all; there were six half guineas among them taken from the prisoner, two half crowns, one looked very fresh, and a silver groat.</p>

               <p>Q. Where did he tell you this?</p>
               <p>B. Lewis. This was in the kitchen, on a Sunday, between two and three o'clock; they must of necessity go over a border of soft ground that is round the place, in order to come at the wall, and the wall is pretty high, so that if this had been true, there must have been the print of their feet to be found: this I told to our housekeeper and

               <p>Q. Do you know at what time the fire happened?</p>
               <p>B. Lewis. The bell awaked me between two and three in the night: we at first thought it was my Lady's bell: Mrs. Davis went from me to the top of the stairs, and asked what was the matter; the prisoner made answer the house was on fire. I and Mrs. Davis went to my Lady's room; I left her with my Lady, and went and fetched the cook down stairs; the first thing I saw was the prisoner, with his hand upon the lock, shewing them where the fire was: he was dress'd in every thing as he was the day before.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when he was searched?</p>

               <p>B. Lewis. I was; it was in the parlour; there were six half guineas, three whole guineas, two half crowns, and a silver groat found upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. to Lady Effingham. When was the money missing?</p>
               <p>Lady Effingham. That was not missing till the fire was all over; that was about twelve or one o'clock in the day. I had the bureau carried over to my Lord Faulconbridge's, knowing there were things of value in it: when the fire was over, I had it brought to me; we plainly saw, that it had been cut at the place where the bolt goes in, to get it open. They had put it in the back-yard; I hearing of that, ordered it to be carried to my Lord's for security, seeing how it had been cut to break it open.</p>
               <p>Q. to B. Lewis. Had the prisoner been out of the house after the fire to the time of the search?</p>
               <p>B. Lewis. He was missing some time between three and four o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner used to be slush of money?</p>

               <p>Q. Was all safe then?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I observed nothing but what was very safe when I heard the alarm of fire.

I went directly to my Lady, and got her out of bed, and went down stairs; there I saw a great smother in the room. I staid in the house till the fire was all out. The bureau was brought to my Lady; she desired it to be carried to my Lord Faulconbridge, where it was taken and lock'd up; only the back part of the bureau was burnt.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner search'd?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I did: there were 6 half-guineas, 3 guineas, 2 half-crowns, and a fourpenny-piece, found upon him. His knife was taken from him. I never saw that knife before that morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you present when the bureau was search'd?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I was; I saw the purse and two bags taken out; the fire had singed them. This was after the bureau was brought back. There was no money in them.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner us'd to be slush of money?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I never knew he had any money before this. Whenever he went to market for my Lady, I have given him money, and I have lent him a shilling.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100026"/>Q. Is there a fire-place in the back-parlour?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. There is; but there had been no fire in it for a great while. My Lady kept no fire in her dressing-room at that time.</p>
               <p>Q. What was burnt?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. The wainscot and chairs were burnt, besides the back part of the bureau, and part of a stool covered with leather.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a window in the closet?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. There is.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the bureau stand up to an outside or inside wall?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. It stood up to an inside wall.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any appearance of any fire coming through the wall from the next house?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the next house on fire?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. No, it was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any fire came down the chimney?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. No, the chimney was boarded up.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a candle in your hand when you went to put my Lady's pin-cushion into the drawer?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I had: the drawer that I opened is not burnt (the bureau produced in court; she goes and takes out the drawer).</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a wax or tallow candle?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. A tallow candle.</p>
               <p>Q. Could not something fall from that candle, so as to set the house on fire?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I am satisfied nothing did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the pin-cushion after?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I did; part of it was burnt that lay backwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you put the candle out of your hand?</p>
               <p>M. Davis. I believe I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. to Catlin. What part of the next house does this closet join to?</p>
               <p>Catlin. The brick-work of the other house comes farther out than my Lady's; I don't know what room it joins to; one Mrs. Parrot lives in it.</p>
               <p>Q. to Catlin. What time did you go to bed that night?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I went to bed about 11 o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a fire at that house at the time?</p>
               <p>Catlin. I never heard of any; the servants came to us the next day; they said nothing of a fire; there was no alarm of fire at that house.</p>

            . I am a watchman: the prisoner once told me there came three men to the back part of the house, and he threw up the window to speak to them, and they went away. He desired me to take particular care to watch the house; I told him I did not watch the back part; my business was on the other side. I was the first that alarm'd the street. I had called the hour of three; I heard the ringing of a bell; the prisoner opened the door: I said, What is the matter? Said he, Watchman, our house is on fire, and I desire you will get assistance. I made to the watch-house, and so on for the fire-engine.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he dressed?</p>

            . I am a card-maker; the prisoner came to our shop for cards; he brought this note (producing one) to pay for some cards, if my master would discount it for him.</p>

               <p>Herculous. I believe it was the beginning of May.</p>

               <p>Herculous. It might be about a fortnight before the fire: he left the note with me; my master was not at home. When he came home in the evening, I told him; said he, I would have you go and see who is to pay it: I went, and found it was a man named Hartwell, that lived in a two-pair-of-stairs room. I desired my master not to discount it; so he said he would take my advice. When the prisoner came, I told him my master did not chuse to discount it: he said he was going into place at Lady Effingham's, and he had no money; so my master lent him six guineas upon the note.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they guineas or half-guineas?</p>

I was present when the prisoner was search'd: I went with Justice Kynaston to Lady Effingham's house between 11 and 12 o'clock; we search'd all the servants, and found 6 halfguineas, 3 guineas, 2 half-crowns, and a silver groat, upon the prisoner at the bar: he had two returned him. We saw the bureau; it appeared to have been cut with something. so that it would open without unlocking it.

I told him, in order to terrify him, I would carry him before a Justice, though I had no intention of doing it. Upon that the prisoner Carrol came up immediately: I believe he was lurking under the side of the New-Church; he seem'd to come that way. He came up. and fix'd his attention upon me and the boy: I went on, leading the boy towards Temple-Bar: I had him by the sleeve of his waistcoat; he had no coat on; he is dress'd the same now. Carrol followed me. When I got at a little distance, I perceived two others that I thought to be part of the gang. The little boy's name is Darby, and the other

            , as I suppose: he was dress'd much as King is now. I took notice of his size, his height, and his hair. I believe he had more hair on his head than now. I cannot say I took particular notice of the features of his face: but he answers in every particular to the remarks I then made of him Carrol was particularly active, sometimes before me, and sometimes behind, as I thought, meditating some mischief to me. Upon seeing this, there was a well-dress'd person behind me, whom I desired to walk behind me, to keep those people off: he promised me he would, saying, he saw there was a gang after me. I walk'd on very slow as the weather was intensely hot; and I was frequently interrupted by the number of people that pass'd by on the new pavement that was then about: we were forced to go over boards, which, with that and stones lying about, I walk'd so very slow, it was four or five minutes before I got to the top of Arundel-street, from the time I first saw these people; it might be more. I talk'd a little while with the boy. When I got there, Carrol came before; he put his head down, and look'd up under my hat; and as soon as I had raised my head, with a back-handed blow, as violent as he could make it, he struck me across the nose and eyes with a knife. I wear my hat exceedingly low on my forehead: the blow was so violent, that it cut my hat entirely through (produced and inspected): it was a very strong hat, almost new. I perceived my nose benumm'd by the violence of the blow. I struck at the fellow with my cane, but unfortunately miss'd him. At first I thought he had put dust in my eyes, by the little capillary vessels bleeding so. I put my hand up in order to wipe the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100028"/> dust away, as I thought, and found the blood running very profusely over my hand; I then went in at the Crown and Anchor, and ordered a surgeon to be sent for; and Mr. Ingram, who lives in Arundel-street, came in about two or three minutes  but before the time he came, I believe I had bled full two quarts. I found the wound had divided the flesh entirely upon my nose; and the knife or instrument, whatever it was, had gone to the bone. My eyes are very much weakened by it, and the muscular part of my nose is very much contracted; and at present I have no sensation in that part of my face where the wound was deepest. I have no feeling on the part where the wound was on my nose. By the time Mr. Ingram had dressed the wound, Dr. Morris, whom I had sent for, came: they ordered me to go home in a chair; and the next morning, when they came to dress me, I was advised to call in another surgeon, though I no ways doubted Mr. Ingram's ability. Mr. Pile, from Westminster hospital, came with them. I think, the next morning: I was not then in a situation to attend Justice Fielding, but desired Dr. Morris to give a description of them as I had given to him. On the Monday morning Carrol, and the two boys, the evidences, were brought to me; I look'd very attentively at Carrol, as I had particularly remarked his dress: I knew him immediately upon seeing him; his ragged breeches I had particularly remark'd, and he had a great coat on that did not come so low as his knees. Byfield, the boy that attempted to pick my pocket, I immediately knew; I talk'd with him about the attempt he had made upon me, which he confessed. I was not quite so certain as to the boy Matthews; he was dressed then much as the boy was who made part of the gang on the Friday evening. On Saturday the 22d of June (I think it was), I went to Sir

I can't be sure of King, but I believe him to be the person. Carrol had the same coat on at the time he cut me he has now. I put an advertisement in the paper for the person that I desired to walk behind me, to come and give evidence: he is now in court.</p>

               <p>Mr. Kirby. At that corner nearest Temple Bar. Carrol slipp'd by me in the Strand, and stopt some few paces before me. When I came up, he look'd under my hat, and cut me, as I before related. I had no sort of doubt then but that he was meditating some mischief against me, and I have none now.</p>

            . I was coming along the Strand on the 7th of June, a little past ten at night. I came up to Mr. Kirby opposite the New Church. Just as I was going to pass him, he stopt the boy nam'd Byfield. He said, You rascal, you had your hand in my pocket. I hearing that, stopt to hear what it was; then I saw Carrol come from towards the New Church, and the boy Matthews followed, and after him came King: they all came from towards the opposite side the way. Mr. Kirby was taking the boy along the street: I stepping a little before, look'd over my shoulder, and said to him, I believe there is a gang behind you: he desired I would walk behind him to keep him from being knock'd down, which I accordingly did. As we were passing along towards Temple-Bar, Carrol came up several times along-side of me; sometimes he was before us, and sometimes behind. A little before we came to Arundel-street, he was behind; and when we came to the corner of the street, he made a push by me, and stopt short till Mr. Kirby came up; then he struck him a back-handed blow cross the face. When he made the blow, he said, D - n you, Sir, let go the boy. I seeing that, jump'd to him, and laid hold of his cloaths behind. Mr. Kirby making a blow at him with his cane, struck me over the hand where I had hold of him: that made me let go my hold: then Carrol ran off across the Strand into St. Clement's church-yard: I pursued him there: he ran through a narrow passage, and I lost sight of him.

            . I was with the two prisoners at the bar on Friday the 7th of June last.</p>
               <p>Carrol. Please to turn out Matthews while this gives his evidence; for what one swears the other will. (He is put out of the court accordingly.)</p>
               <p>Byfield. Barny Carrol and I had been together all day; we met King at night at the Golden Boot in Cross-lane, about six or seven o'clock; there was Matthews; we all four of us made an agreement to go out that night. Matthews and I were to pick pockets, or take hats, and the other two were to come up if any body molested us; they were to strike or stab, or cut the nose and eyes, of any that stopt us; they were to receive the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100029"/> handkerchiefs, or what we took out of gentleman's pockets. Matthews and I had found a razor-bladed knife on the King's birth-day, and Barney Carrol gave us each a penny for it; he had that with him at the Boot; he said, D - n his blood, he wou'd make it sharp; and if any body molested us, he would stab them, or cut their nose and eyes. We went down Bow-street, Convent-Garden, and was in the Strand between nine and ten o'clock. Mr. Kirby's pocket was the first I attempted to pick that night: the prisoners were behind us two boys; Carrol bid me go after that pocket: King was the last of us; I went and put my hand in Mr. Kirby's pocket; he turned about, and laid hold of my sleeve, and ask'd me what business my hand had in his pocket, and led me along about twenty yards: Carrol came along-side of me; I said, Keep away, the gentleman will let me go. Carrol was out into the high-way, and he walked by us; he came up three or four times; he was sometimes before, and sometimes behind. About five minutes after he look'd up into the gentleman's face, and ran his hat under his hat, and struck a back-handed blow on his face: this was by Arundel-street: he said, D - n you, let the boy go; then the gentleman let me go, and I ran behind a coach. and got away.

             the next day; he said, D - n him but he had cut his nose off, and bragg'd of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was this?</p>
               <p>Byfield. This was up in the ruins in St. Giles's; I saw the knife the next morning also; it was bloody; (a clasp knife produced in court, handle and blade about nine inches long when open); this is the knife.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was King when Mr. Kirby had hold of you?</p>
               <p>Byfield. I saw him; Carrol turned about to King, and said, D - n him. but I will cut him. This was about two minutes before he did cut him.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of King that night?</p>
               <p>Byfield. I saw king run away after Carrol; they both ran away across St. Clement's church-yard.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mr. Carr. Did you see King when you was in pursuit of Carrol?</p>
               <p>Mr. Carr. I can't say I did; there were several people in the church-yard at the time.</p>
               <p>Mr. Kirby. When Carrol ran away, Mr. Carr ran after him; and the man I saw with Carrol, which I believe to be King, ran after Mr. Carr. Mr. Carr was close to Carrol, and King was about a yard and a half behind Mr. Carr. I understood he was pursuing Mr. Carr.</p>
               <p>Darby Matthews. I met Carrol, King, and Byfield, at the Boot in Cross-lane, about 9 o'clock that night; I cannot rightly say the time; it began to be dark. We agreed that Byfield and I should pick pockets, and the two men were to assist us, to cut any body across the face that should lay hold of us. Carrol produced a razor bladed knife (he takes the knife up in his hand); this is it, Carrol swore he would cut off the nose of any body that should attempt to lay hold of us. We all four went out together for this purpose; we went into Bow-street, Covent-Garden, and down into the Strand by the New Church; and the first pocket we attempted to pick was Mr. Kirby's; Byfield attempted it: we were all on the same side the way as he was on; we all came down Catharine-street, and so cross'd the way to that side Somerset-house is on: I was last of all till I saw Byfield attempt to put his right hand in his pocket. then I went up. The gentleman took him by the sleeve, and said some words about his hand being in his pocket, and led him along to Arundel-street. Byfield ask'd the gentleman if he had lost any thing or not; he answered, If it had not been for my good look-out, I should have lost something or some such words. King kept behind all; Carrol kept walking backwards and forwards; he went beyond them, then back again, and look'd at them: I could observe more plainly than Byfield could; ( he was engaged. I saw the knife in Carrol's hand, but I did not see him draw it; I saw it shine when he was behind Mr. Kirby; he put his hand to his side, and I saw the blade shine by the lamps; he strove to hide it under his coat when he went by the gentleman: he went backwards and forwards till he came near a tavern; there he waited till Mr. Kirby came up; then he took it in this manner (throwing his hand backwards); and said, D - n you, Sir, let the boy go. Byfield was let go: I saw the gentleman's hand go up, as if he put it to his eyes, and heard a cane rattle, as if it fell on some stones. Byfield ran away first towards the church-yard, then Carrol ran across the street; a gentleman followed him, and King was behind: I can't tell what became of him.</p>
               <p>Q Where was King at the time the blow was given?</p>
               <p>Matthews. King was at that time behind with me.</p>
               <p>Q. How near was you to Mr. Kirby when the blow was given?</p>

             and Matthews. I laid hold of Carrol, and said, You are the man I have been looking for: said he, I judg'd it. I took this knife out of his right-hand breeches-pocket, which I had taken from him before. I said, Now shew me the nearest way to St. Giles's round-house, and I will not hand cuff you: I had a cutlass in my side-pocket. On the Friday I saw King; he was, I believe, in the same dress as now; I believe he had a deal more hair than he has now; he had a hat in his hand. Carrol and Byfield were on one side the way, and King on the other; they were even with each other: I had known the other two a great while, but I did not know so much of King; I thought they all belonged to each other, but I did not trouble myself about them then.</p>
               <p>Mr. Dale Ingram. I was sent for to Mr. Kirby on Friday the 7th of June, a little after 10 at night, to the Crown and Anchor tavern in the Strand. In passing through the alley, I found a vast quantity of blood. When I came into the room, his forehead was pouring out; I believe there were near two quarts of blood; I found the two great vessels on his forehead divided; there was a large transverse wound across the nose; it was open so wide, that I saw the bone naked. I examined the wound.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the nose slit?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. The old word slit we now leave off, and call it divided, in surgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Is that what was formerly called slitting?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. It is; we understand them as synonymous terms. When it comes there, we call it a transverse slit wound. Mr. Wiseman, who wrote on surgery, makes use of the word slitting for what we now call dividing.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose a blow was across the arm, would not that be a slit wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. We make no distinction whether it is directed one way or the other.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose they had slit the nostril?</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. We call that an incis'd wound.</p>
               <p>Court. Describe the wound.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ingram. It began from the right, and went across the eye lid, and across the nose; the two muscles of the nose were cut through; it proceeded to the left eye lid, and terminated at the temple: there is a nerve cut: I suppose the eyes were saved by the knife touching the hat. the hat saved him, or I believe it would have been fatal.</p>
               <p>Dr. Morris. I saw the wound; it was of a very alarming kind; I advised for sending for farther help, left very bad consequences should attend it.</p>
               <p>Q. Can that be called a slitting?</p>
               <p>Dr. Morris. I should think there is no impropriety in calling that a slit; the nose was cut across through to the bone; all the vessels were divided. In many old authors, such wounds are called slits.</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyle. On the Sunday I was desired to wait on Mr. Kirby.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard Mr. Ingram's description of the wound?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyle. I have; I found he had received a wound across the nose, and across the left eye to the temple; it was not then bare; it had been dress'd; there was a great inflammation, and a very large wound; I saw it open'd and dress'd; the flesh of the nose was entirely divided.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it proper to call that a slit?</p>
               <p>Mr. Pyle. Slit is a word not made use of now; but if any body had told me of the wound, and made use of the word slit. I should have known what they meant. I understand the words slit and cut to be synonymous terms.</p>

The reason of my disguise was, I being unfortunately upon the town, that situation was not agreeable to me, and I disguised myself to get from it. I have lived some time in a brew-house; there I was discovered by a person that knew me; since that I have employed myself as a taylor, where I was apprehended.</p>

               <p>Q. Are you sure it was bolted over night?</p>
               <p>Easley. I bolted it myself on the Tuesday night: my wife had told in half-pence and silver to the amount of nineteen shillings on the Wednesday morning, and put it into a pewter pint wine measure, and set it on the cellar-head; they could come up the cellar stairs to it, but could not open the door to come into the tap-room: she turned it out on the Friday, and there was but twelve shillings and two-pence halfpenny remaining, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100035"/> she had put in a shilling and some halfpence after she told it: I desired her to say nothing of it: I thought they would come again for the rest, so I sat up the next night, but nobody came. On the Saturday my son and I both sat up; we left the cellar window unbolted, and I had put a few halfpence into the measure. About two o'clock on the Sunday morning, we heard the window open: then I went out to the window, and call'd who was there: I call'd to a man; he came to my assistance; then I got a light and went down at the window; these were the two boys at the bar; one of them had emptied the halfpence into his hat: he threw his hat and all down: there were some of the halfpence lying in the hat, and the measure lay on the ground by it: I heard them throw'd down: I brought the boys up into the kitchen, and asked them if they had any body belonged to them; they said they had not: they owned they had been there on the Thursday night, and took seven shillings and a bottle of gin, which they said was the first time; and that they came on the Friday night, and took away a bottle of gin, and sold it to the soldiers for fourteen-pence.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know either of the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Easley. Vincent was apprenticed out of Kensington school; the gentleman at the school says he is fifteen years of age; Bingley says he is about the same age. I took them to the constable, who took the pieces of brass cocks out of Bingley's pocket.</p>

            . Last Sunday morning the two prisoners were brought to my house, and delivered into my custody: I searched them, and found this tinder-box, steel, and flint, (no tinder) in one of Vincent's pockets, and the other pocket almost full of gun-powder: I asked him how he came by that tinder-box; he said a boy gave it him to strike a light on the common, when they were at play; and I took these pieces of brass cocks out of Bingley's pocket. (produced in court and deposed to.) I found in his pocket four shillings; I asked him how he came by it; he said Vincent told him it was four shillings of the money they took on the Thursday night: I asked what they did with the rest of the money they took that night; Bingley said they had brought a pistol in Oxford-road, and had sold it again to the man they bought it of, for one shilling and ninepence.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. What money was in the measure on Saturday night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. There was about a shilling or sixteen pence in halfpence.</p>

Last Sunday was se'en-night, at night, my wife and daughter put my hogs into the stye; I saw them there, and fed them as usual: when I got up in the morning they were gone, two hogs and two pigs: two of them were almost 12 months, the other two were about four months old. My wife, children, and I, went about to see for them, and could hear nothing of them, till a team was coming from Hounslow-Heath; the waggoner told a bargeman a poor man had lost all his hogs; the bargeman told him he saw three russianly fellows driving four pigs through Old Brentford, a little before two o'clock: the bargeman came and told me this; I was directed to Mr. Turner, near Hyde-Park Corner, who keeps hogs, thinking he might have heard of people with hogs. While I was there, a dog-skinner came, and said a parcel of pigs were sold cheap at Brumpton: Mr. Turner and I went there, and met with a gardener, who gave us farther intelligence, by which means we found the two biggest alive, in the custody of widow Hore: we went to a public-house just by her, and the landlord had brought one of the little pigs; he had killed it, and some of it was left: this was at Mr. Tutt's, at the Bell and Horns at Brumpton; then we went to the prisoner's house, and found one alive there; he lived at Hay-Hill, in a cellar, between Berkley-square and Piccadilly: we took him to Justice Fielding; he said he bought the pig of one

            . I live at the Bell and Horns at Brumpton. On Sunday was se'nnight, about 10 in the morning, the prisoner and Prince were at my house; they drank some beer, and talk'd to Mr. Blake, a gardener; they said they should bring some pigs on the Monday morning, and he should have the preference of them. Accordingly, on the Monday morning, about a quarter before five, Prince and two more men came with him with the pigs, and about a quarter of an hour after the prisoner came. Before the first pot was half oat, they ask'd for Mr. Blake; I said he was gone to town; they waited three hours about my door; I ask'd what they would have for one of the great pigs; they ask'd a guinea; I said it is worth 18 s. they said they would not take less: they called for another pot of beer; I then ask'd the price of one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100037"/> of the small ones; they ask'd 9 s. I said I would give eight and a pot of beer; then Dust said to Prince, Take the money: I accordingly gave the money to Prince; after that Dust came and ask'd me to buy the two large ones, and said I should have them worth the money: said I, What is that? the pigs that I offered 18 s. a-piece for at first: he offered me the two at 32 s. I said that would not do; then he came back to me, and said I should have them for 31 s. then I began to think they stole them; I said, I will have nothing to do with you nor your pigs neither; I wish I had not bought the other: that I bought weighed 32 pounds when dead: I gave after the rate of 31/4 d. a pound.</p>
               <p>Q. What colour was it?</p>
               <p>Tutt. A white barrow pig.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was yours such a pig?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. It was, and weighed about that weight.</p>
               <p>Tutt. The prisoner said he would have the other pig himself for a breeding sow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pay for it?</p>
               <p>Tutt. I did not see him give any money for it.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the other mens names?</p>
               <p>Tutt. One was nam'd Kitchen, and the other Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the pigs worth which they ask'd you 31 s. for?</p>
               <p>Tutt. They were worth 20 s. a-piece.</p>

On the Monday morning he came again to Mr. Tutt's; he said to me, If you will have my pigs, here they be: my mother came there and saw them; she bid 30 s. for three, and at last agreed for 30 s. for two.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Hore. I am a gardener; my mother keeps a garden, and goes to market and sells things: I heard Mr. Tutt bid 18 s. for the best pig.</p>
               <p>Q. Who appeared to be the owner of the pigs?</p>
               <p>Hore. Prince did; Dust made the bargain with me.</p>

               <p>Harris. I live at Earl's Court, near Brumpton; we went to the White Hart, and had some gin; then we went to the Bell, and had some beer: Dust said he knew a man in the country that had some pigs to dispose of, and he had not a place proper to keep them in.</p>

Hore's mother came and offered me a shilling for my bargain; I said I would not par with it, because I wanted it for a breeder; then the young man came and bid money for two pigs; he said his mother would give no more than 30 s. so they let her have them. I drove mine home, and put it into the stye; I gave 7 s. for it; then I went about my business to my work: the next day Mr. Turner came and ask'd to see my pig; I shewed him it; the prosecutor was there; he said it was his, and took it away; they said I must go before Justice Fielding; I went there, and said I had the pig of three men: the Justice sent me to see if I could find them out; we went all about, and it began to be night; then Mr. Turner said we might as well go home about our business; so I went home.

               <p>Q. Where does your mother live?</p>
               <p>Turner. In Berwick-street; I live there also. The watchman said, the man that had them was in the round-house; I went there, and ask'd the prisoner what his name was; he said his name was Pickering: I ask'd him if it was not Prince; he said, No: I ask'd him if he could read or write; he said, No: I ask'd him if he was not clear'd on Wednesday; he said he was: I ask'd what he was doing with the two sows; he said he was going to drive them to the Green yard: I ask'd him if he was not ashamed of committing so rash an act, just after his being accused with a crime of the same sort; he said he wanted some money to buy him some shoes, or to sole his shoes; I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the hogs lost from out of a stye, or where?</p>
               <p>Turner. We always lock them up; but I believe the man was a little in liquor that night, and did not lock them up; it is always my order that they should be lock'd up.</p>

I am a watchman belonging to St. James's; the prisoner came by a little before two in the morning; I knowing the two sows, stopt him, and ask'd him where he was driving the two hogs; he said to St. James's market: after that he said he was going to drive them to Tothilfields Pound: I told him he should drive them no farther; he swore he would; I said he should not: I took him to the watch-house, and drove the hogs home to Mr. Turner's. The prisoner told me he had been confined some time, and had been acquitted that day.</p>

You every day of your<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100043"/> lives endanger yourselves of being convicted by this sort of practice. I hope, at least, the reprimand you have received will be of use to you; and, when you report it to your master, I hope it will be of use to him. If pawnbrokers will suffer their people to carry on their business thus, it will end, most certainly, in their going abroad.

            . I am Constable of the parish of St. Martin's: on the 22d of June, it was my turn to go round the parish at night; we found a man in Hedge-lane had lost his watch; I laid hold of the person suspected to have taken it; but the boy made his escape: the boy at the bar, and the evidence Linnerkin appearing to belong to him, we secured them: there were several handkerchiefs found on the prisoner. Upon the handkerchiefs being found, the boys made information, that they used to sell the handkerchiefs to Mrs. Bennet; and these handkerchiefs were found in her house. (Producing seven linen handkerchiefs, of different colours, washed and ironed.) The boys have swore they sold her them; she sells old clothes. We took the evidence there; he said there lie the handkerchiefs: she acknowledged buying some of the boys, and said we might take them: she said she asked the boys how they came by them, and they said they tossed up for them.</p>

            . On the 17th of May, I believe, about six in the afternoon, I was going up Snow-Hill; I heard a person say there was a riot on Ludgate-Hill; I thought it my duty, as a peace-officer, to go there: I went; and when I got there, there were no windows at all broke: I was there just at the beginning of the mobbing; I believe there was not a man among the weavers threw a stone; I observed the prisoner at the bar was very active in throwing stones; he broke a great number of windows himself; he threw very large pebble-stones from the pavement; and after the windows were most of them broke, the lamps were broke; but whether the prisoner broke the lamps, I cannot tell; he had a large saggot-stick in his hand; he took one of the tops of the lamps upon his stick, and vapoured it about, and tossed it into a cart that was going along; after which he threw the same stick through a two-pair-of-stairs window: he was going to pull down the sign, but a gentleman that stood by him had more wit than he; he tapp'd him on the shoulder, and said. Take care what you are about, young man; the prisoner took the hint, and walked away; I follow'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176507100044"/> him, thinking it in vain to take him then: In Cheapside I met Mr. Gates, the under city-marshal, to whom I told the prisoner was the principal man in the riot: that he had broke more windows, and done more mischief, than all the weavers. Immediately he seized him: I took hold of one arm, and he the other, and we led him to the Compter.</p>
