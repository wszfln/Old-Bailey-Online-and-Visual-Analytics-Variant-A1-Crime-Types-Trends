               <p>Baker. As I was going into the Rope-Walk, I saw a Stranger bring the Gun in; Mr. Wallis takes the Gun to look at it; it was a Gun that unskrew'd . The Man pulled the Rammer out of his Pocket, for there was no Place in the Gun to put the Rammer in; so he folds it together again, and puts it into his Pocket. I watch'd it all the while, as he was turning of it about. The Man that owned the Gun stood with his Back to me.</p>

               <p>Gilpin. A Grocer. I miss'd Money out of my Till several Times; and one Week I put in every Night a Guinea in Silver before I went up Stairs; the first Night he took 3 s. 6 d. the next Night nothing, the Night after that 4 s . 6 d. I told one of my Journeymen that I had several Times miss'd Money out of my Till, and that I would mark some of it; accordingly I mark'd Half a Crown and 13 Shillings and Six-pence, and bid my Man go into the Compting-House to watch in the Dark, which he did: In about five Minutes Time he rung the Bell, and told me the Porter had taken 5 s. in Silver and 10 s. in Half-pence: The Porter was there and the Journeyman : I said to him, John, what Money have you got in your Pocket ? He said he had none of mine. There were 5 s. in Silver and 10 s. in Half-pence. The next Day I had him before Sir

About the 18th of August, between Nine and Ten o'clock in the Evening, I was in my Master's Compting-House; the Prisoner was in the Cellar, from whence he came and went to the Compter, where he took out a little Drawer with some Silver in it. I was on the opposite Side; but did not come out presently. I saw him take the Drawer and hold it up to the Candle.</p>
               <p>Q. How could you see what he took out .</p>
               <p>Jones . My Lord, I saw him take the Drawer and hold it up to the Candle, and after he had taken the Money out of the Till he fit the Candle upon the Desk, knelt down and took a Paper of Half-pence, which he held up to the Candle. We generally mark what we put in, sometimes 5 s. worth and sometimes 10 s .</p>

               <p>Q. After you had seen this Fact what did you do?</p>
               <p>Jones. He took the Candle , my Lord, and went down to the Cellar again; then I came out of the Compting-House and rung the Bell for my Master, to let him know what had happen'd ; then my Master came down and charg'd him with the Money.</p>
               <p>Q. What did your Master say to him?</p>
               <p>Jones. My Master told him he had miss'd Money several Times, but now he had found him out. The Prisoner said he had no Money but what was his own, and pull'd out the five Shillings that were produced in Court.</p>

            (to William - , Constable) Give an Account touching this Charge against the Prisoner at the Bar.</p>
               <p>Constable. On the 16th of September last the City Marshal said he had a Warrant to take up Lake the Prisoner , and ask'd me if I would serve it; I asked him where he (Lake) was; he said in Wood-Street Compter for a Quarrel in Bartholomew-Fair ; he said he could not let him go, except the Lord Mayor would discharge him, and he did discharge him. When he was in the Coach, he reflected much upon Collet, and said, Men are easily frightned ; I would as soon be D - d as to do any such Thing. The Prisoner said, my Friends would have had me have done this six Weeks ago; I said what; he said, turn Evidence, but he would as soon be D - d as do any such Thing, for Men are frightned , said he, at their own Shadow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe that Collet and he were well acquainted?</p>
               <p>Constable. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was it they first met?</p>
               <p>Constable. At Justice Rickards's , Collet spoke to Lake, and Lake to him again, and said I was advis'd ten Weeks ago to do this. I said do what ? he said turn Evidence.</p>

               <p>Lake. He was about the Room.</p>
               <p>Court. You say that you was his Bed-fellow; would you chuse to be Bed-fellow to a Person that has the Itch ?</p>
               <p>Lake. Sir, I had it myself.</p>
               <p>Court. You say he was never out of his Room; did you keep the Chamber with him?</p>
               <p>Lake. I kept my Father's Door; I am sensible he was never out.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your Brother lay out of Nights from the 8th of May to the 22d? Did he ever lay out of Nights at all?</p>

               <p>Lake. He came home the 8th of May; he was taken ill when he came home, and it prov'd to be the Itch; he did not go out from the 8th to the 22d, I won't say he kept one Room, because he might go out of one into another.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to be so particular to the 22d of May.</p>
               <p>Lake. I'll give you a very good Reason for it; for my Husband and this Lad of mine was at Maidstone Fair the 1st of May.</p>
               <p>Court. Then he never lay out of Nights?</p>
               <p>Lake. To the best of my Knowledge he never lay out, except it was when he was at a Fair.</p>

Mr. Godwin told me, upon searching at Chelsea , where she had a Bastard Child at Nurse, that her Child had the Skirt of a Coat of a remarkable fine Silk; upon which I desir'd him to bring it to my House at London; by comparing it, we found it to be the very same Silk which had lain by as useless, 'till we should make it up for Child of our own.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you them?</p>

               <p>Court. You don't lay them as yours?</p>
               <p>Sumers . No, they were my Master's, my Lord, Mr. Porter's. The Livery Clothes were taken out of the Stable the 7th of September.</p>
               <p>Q. What Reason have you to say that the Prisoner at the Bar had any thing to do with taking them ?</p>
               <p>Sumers. On the 28th of September I caught that Boy rising a Ladder against the Lost Door.</p>

               <p>Q. But what had that to do with the Lost?</p>
               <p>Sumers. It was just by the Lost, where he rose the Ladder; I examin'd, but I could see no such Thing as a Top. About a Fortnight before that, he push'd open the Stable Door; he ask'd me whether it was not a Thorough-fare ; I told him, no. He told me that one of the Bricklayers had sent him up, and told him it was a Thorough-fare . I sent him out . When I took him at the Ladder, he declared to me, he never was in the Yard before .</p>

            .) What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morgan. On the 13th of April last was a Twelve-Month I lost a Guinea; this Man, the Prisoner at the Bar, and another along with him, came into my Shop: My Wife had just receiv'd four Guineas, and push'd them up towards me to put them into the Till; but I was busy and the Prisoner put out his Hand and took up a Guinea: I saw him, but thought he would have put it down again. He withdrew himself as if he would go out, and said, you know I am an honest Man, I will soon return it; so he whipp'd away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure that he took the Guinea away?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Yes, my Lord, I spoke to him when he was going away, and that was his Answer.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this ago? You say last April was a Twelve-Month.</p>
               <p>Morgan. This Man, my Lord, was never to be found by me nor others that wanted to take him. I heard that the other Person went sometimes as his Servant, his Footman, and sometimes for his Son.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Night was it?</p>
               <p>Morgan. About Ten o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What Shop do you keep?</p>
               <p>Morgan. A Broker's Shop, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What did you sell there?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Not much; sometimes I sell some Things. I went to several Places to enquire after him: I am positive this is the Man, I saw him at my House twice before, about a Fortnight before that Time.</p>
               <p>Q. What Business did he follow?</p>
               <p>Morgan. I never heard of any Business, besides taking of Houses and defrauding People; I never heard any other Character of him in my Life.</p>
               <p>Court. (to the Prisoner.) You hear what this Man says.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Man is a Pawnbroker, my Lord; I was oblig'd to pawn some Things about a Twelve-Month ago, and he lent me a Guinea more upon them about a Week after: I wanted a little more Money upon a Wig that cost me three Guineas. Ask him whether he did not lend me a Guinea more upon the Plate last Easter Saturday was a Twelve-Month; upon two Silver Spoons and a Silver Salt .</p>

               <p>Q. What did you advance at first upon the Plate?</p>
               <p>Morgan. My Lord, I don't remember exactly what it was; but he had it again .</p>
               <p>Q. When you was robb'd of this Guinea did you pursue the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Morgan. My Lord, I went to the Door, but I could not see where he was gone.</p>

               <p>Q. What Day was that ?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Really, my Lord, I can't tell justify the Day, but it was about a Twelve-Month ago. My Husband went several Times after him, but could not find him.</p>

               <p>Q. How long did she stay?</p>
               <p>Eddison . About an Hour and Half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you make any Pursuit after her?</p>
               <p>Eddison. She said she lived down at Tower-Hill; I went down that Way, and going about the Street I enquired of Black-shoe Folks, and the like, and I heard of her; at last I came up Wellclose-Square and I saw her standing in Rosemary-Lane the next Day; I ask'd her whether she was not at my House yesterday Afternoon, she said yes; I desir'd her to go home with me; which she accordingly did; then I ask'd the Maid if that was not the Person, and the Maid said yes; so I charg'd her with the Robbery, and she told me she had not got them ; I pleaded with her hard to tell me where the Spoons were ; she would not tell me any Thing about them, so I charg'd the Constable with her. After we got her before the Justice she confess'd it, she said she was turn'd out of her Lodgings, that she had not a Farthing in the World to help herself; that she had sold the great Spoon, and the little one she threw into the Vault .</p>
               <p>Q. What was it worth ?</p>
               <p>Eddison. They were both valued at 5 s. She told me she had pawn'd it in Ratcliffe Highway , so on the Friday I went to every Silversmith and Pawnbroker I could find, and I happen'd to go to this Gentlewoman's House, Mrs. Wiles; I ask'd if there was not a Spoon there that

            (to John Manning) What have you to aledge against the Prisoner ?</p>
               <p>Manning. She came into the Kitchen and took the Spoon .</p>
               <p>Q. Was you in the Kitchen yourself?</p>
               <p>Manning. No, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she took the Spoon? Did you see her come out of the Kitchen?</p>
               <p>Manning. When Dinner is over the Pewter is wash'd up and brought into the Bar, and a Spoon being lost, all the Servants were examin'd about it; but as it could not be found I was thinking of advertising of it; in the mean Time, one Mr. Clew, Constable of Westminster, came to me and ask'd me if I had lost any Thing; I told him I had just miss'd a Silver Spoon, and he said he had got one. She went to pawn it to him, and he had the Spoon in his Custody; I told him if it was mine I would shew him the Fellow to it, which I did; when I went down to the Round-House with the Constable, she begg'd I would be favourable to her, and she would never do any such Thing again.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure this is the Woman that came to your House?</p>
               <p>Manning. I am sure of the Woman. When I went down to the Round-House she begg'd I would be favourable to her; I told her it was out of my Power, it must be as the Law directs; with that I went to Justice Manly. She said it was given her among some broken Victuals, some stew'd Beef, which we had none of for two Days before. First she said it was given her with broken Victuals , and afterwards own'd that she took it.</p>

               <p>- Clew. I am the Constable of St. Margaret's , Westminster.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say against the Prisoner?</p>
               <p>Clew . Mr. Pearson sent for me, when I came, there was this Woman, the Prisoner at the Bar, with this Spoon.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150018"/>Q. What did he charge her with?</p>
               <p>Clew. He stopp'd this Spoon, as stolen .</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with her before the Justice .</p>
               <p>Clew. Yes, my Lord .</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say at Justice Manly's?</p>
               <p>Clew. She deny'd the taking of it.</p>
               <p>- Pearson. On Saturday the 4th of October came in a short Woman, (not the Prisoner at the Bar) with this Spoon; she desir'd to know if it was Silver, and what she might have for it, and said she found it upon a Dunghill in Tyburn-Road. Whilst I was speaking with the Woman the Prisoner at the Bar immediately said, 'tis my Spoon; and that it was given her: I said, given you, by whom? she said, at the House where I had some broken Victuals : I ask'd her what House, and bid her tell me particularly and I would send my Servant; she said she could not tell; I then said I would charge a Constable with her; she said it was her Property, and she gave it the other Woman to pawn; upon that I sent for the Constable, and went before Justice Manly; there she said it was given her with broken Victuals; he ask'd her how much, she said about as much as you could hold in your Hand; he said it was strange such a Spoon should be buried in it. She said it was stew'd Beef.</p>

The Defendant, Taylor, goes to Doctors-Commons, and enquires for Mr. Rushworth, Proctor; this Mr. Rushworth ask'd him whether he was the Person to be marry'd ; he answer'd he was not: Perhaps you will wonder, he that was to personate Mr. Holland, should say he was not Mr. Holland; the Reason of that was, that he had not as yet got on the Cloaths of Mr. Holland that were design'd for him. Upon this Mr. Rushworth told him that he must have one of the Parties themselves come to him, and that Party must enter into a Bond, or make an Affidavit , or he could not grant a Licence. He returned to the Sun Tavern, where the Defendant Robinson was waiting for him, and told her what Mr. Rushworth said; she goes immediately to Mr. Rushworth , and enters into Bond according to the Practice of that Court and Place, and the Place that was fix'd upon for this Marriage , was at St. Andrew's Holbourn; it was not at the Fleet, or any such scandalous Place, therefore the Place fix'd upon was St. Andrew's . When Matters were so far prepar'd, the next Step was, she dress'd up the Defendant , Taylor, in order to personate Mr. Holland; therefore , Gentlemen, he is sent to Mr. Casker for this Box; the Box is delivered to him according to the Direction of the Defendant Robinson; he carries it to Mr. Stangate's in Holbourn, opens the Box, takes out the Coat, Neckloth , and Wig, and puts his own Cloaths in the Box: He then goes immediately to the King's Head Tavern, Holbourn, where the Defendant, Robinson, was waiting for him, to go to be married. When he came there, it was necessary the Wig should be comb'd out; the Wig was comb'd out ; from thence they went immediately to the Church, where the Defendant, Taylor, answer'd to the Name of

             , and was married in that Name: So they return'd to the King's Head Tavern to take a short Dinner. It was then thought the Business was done. They had then done with the Cloaths of Mr. Holland, therefore the next Thing was to send them out of the Way; so the Defendant, Taylor, goes back to Mr. Stangate's , changes his Cloaths, puts Mr. Holland's Cloaths into the Box, and takes a Person to carry the Box to Mr. Caskers. About an Hour after, the Defendant, Robinson, goes to enquire after this Box; she gets somebody to carry it to Mr. Holland's, and at Mr. Holland's there was a Key of the Box left with the Defendant, Taylor , but it happen'd that the Wig in this Box was missing, and it happen'd likewise there were some Papers in the Coat Pocket, which he put up in a particular Manner, which when he came to see again, he found they were put out of Order: These two Things together, with something Mr. Holland was told, gave him some Suspicion, that he set about searching into this Affair; upon that he took up both the Defendants, and carried them before Sir

            . The Defendant, Taylor, made a Confession; we have Evidence of both their Confessions, but we believe we shall hardly have Occasion to make Use of either of them, but there is one Circumstance that may be mentioned, which happen'd upon this Information. The Defendant, Taylor, was ask'd, whether the Marriage was consummated ; upon that the Defendant , Robinson, said, you don't understand the Meaning of that Word; upon that he spoke plainly, that he had not lain with her. I mention this to shew that there was no real Marriage intended by these two Persons, but a fraudulent Marriage to another Person. 'Tis not to be suppos'd , that Persons that had so much Art and Wickedness to conduct a Scheme of this Kind, should have so much Honesty to declare their wicked Intentions, therefore the Fact must be gather'd from Circumstances. Let us consider what would be the natural Consequence of this Marriage, suppose it could have been brought to take Effect, between Mr. Holland, and the Defendant, Robinson; if it took Effect in his Life-time, it would have been the greatest Injury imaginable, not only in Point of Fortune , in marrying 2 Gentleman of Fortune to a Servant, a Person worth nothing , and probably less than nothing, and binding him to a Woman; whereas the very Manner of his being bound to her, he must derest and abhor. If it was to take an Effect after his Death, then it would be a great Loss to the Heirs of Mr. Holland, who would lose so much of their own just Rights . 'Tis not only a Misdemeanour, but of such a heinous Nature ,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150020"/> that there is no Punishment that the Law can inflict for a Misdemeanour , is severe enough.</p>
               <p>Please your Lordship, I am likewise Council for the Prosecution. - Gentlemen, this is an Offence of the most uncommon Kind, as well as of a most wicked and dangerous Tendency. 'Tis a Robbery not only against a single Person, but his Heirs and Executors ; it would leave an Imputation of Charge upon him after his Death: All this was to be effected after his Death, the Consequence of this would have been, to set up Claims for the Distribution of his Estate against his Heirs and nearest of Kin : Nay, it might have been attended with another Consequence ; he might have married a Lady , and have had Children, that this fictitious Marriage might have been set up against his real one, and might prove his lawful Children to be illegitimate, and his Estate go amongst Counterfeits and Impostors.</p>
               <p>The Common Law of England, as 'tis a Law of Mercy, anticipates the Devices of wicked People; therefore, Gentlemen, if we prove this Fact of Confederacy , if that Man did personate Mr. Holland in that Marriage, you will inflict such a Punishment as the Crime deserves, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Court. I am not for going a round-about Way when a shorter is sufficient; you might go through all the other Evidence for the Entertainment of the Audience, but if you prove the Fact 'tis sufficient.</p>

And as to the Prisoner at the Bar, I can safely take an Affidavit to the Man; as to the Woman, I belive her to be the Woman; but she had an extraordinary large black Bonnet on, that I could not see Part of her Face: As to the Man, he had such a large white Coat, that you might almost put a little Boy in it ; you might button it Half a Yard over.</p>

               <p>Q. What did you see this Woman do?</p>
               <p>Moor. Sir, I saw her do no particular Act, but only came for a Licence.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she say?</p>
               <p>Moor. I did not hear her say any thing particular.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you believe that to be the Licence?</p>
               <p>Moor. I believe so; but I did not see the Inside of it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she subscribe an Affidavit?</p>
               <p>Moor. Not in my Presence.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150023"/>Council. How came you to be so positive to this Gentlewoman ; did you ever see her before?</p>
               <p>Moor. No, Sir.</p>
               <p>Council. I suppose you don't remember all the Persons that come to your House for Licences. If her Face was cover'd with this Bonnet, my Lad, how came you to be so particular as to her Face.</p>
               <p>Moor. It's a Thing that seldom happens , for a Woman to a apply for a Licence .</p>
               <p>Council. So then, when a Woman applies for a Licence, you more particularly remark her. Had you met this Woman afterwards in the Street, should you have known her?</p>
               <p>Moor. Yes; because, I believe I have seen her before, considerable Time before she liv'd in that Neighbourhood .</p>
               <p>Council. Just now, if I understood you, you said you had not seen her before: If you had been accidentally in her Company, should you have remark'd that she was the same Woman, if you had had no particular Cause to have taken Notice of her?</p>
               <p>Moor . I don't know whether I should or no.</p>
               <p>Council. My Lad, I would ask you, How long was it before any body came to ask you any thing with relation to that Woman ?</p>
               <p>Moor. About nine or ten Days.</p>
               <p>Council. Who was the Person that apply'd to you ?</p>
               <p>Moor. One Mr. Gosling, a Proctor in the Commons.</p>
               <p>Council. Did you then presently recollect the Circumstances of that Woman.</p>
               <p>Moor. When they told me of the Licence , I recollected then.</p>
               <p>Council. When you was first apply'd to, did you, or did you not recollect the Person of the Woman?</p>
               <p>Moor. The Question that was put to me was, Whether I did not remember there was such a Licence? but I could not, at that Instant , recollect that she was the Woman , 'till they told me Circumstances more particular .</p>
               <p>Q. Now, before you recollected that she was the Person of the Woman, did any body remind you of any particular Circumstance to put it into your Memory? The first Time you saw her, did you recollect her?</p>
               <p>Moor. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council . This Mrs. Robinson is a pretty tall Woman; therefore, though she had a Bonnet upon her Head, you might see her Face much easier than another Person, as you are such a short Man .</p>
               <p>Moor . Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Then you were very curious , my Lad , and peep'd very earnestly at it; then it pleas'd you very much.</p>

               <p>Parker. I know the Gentlewoman, not by Name, but by Sight, for many Years ago .</p>
               <p>Q. Do you remember her being at the King's-Head Tavern the 18th of July?</p>
               <p>Parker. I remember she was there, (but I can't remember the Time) and I think that Man, the Prisoner, was with her about Ten o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. How were they dress'd ?</p>
               <p>Parker. She was dress'd in white Sattin and a Bonnet ; she staid there and drink'd a Pint of Wine herself, before that Gentleman came. He went out, and came in again; when he came in again he came in a light-colour'd Coat and a light Wig, and he wanted the Wig comb'd; he said, You need not carry it to the Barber's; Can't you comb it yourself; so I comb'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. What did they do there ?</p>
               <p>Parker . They din'd there .</p>
               <p>Q. What had they for Dinner ?</p>
               <p>Parker. To the best of my Remembrance, they had an Artichoke and a cold Lobster.</p>
               <p>Council. Please your Lordship, and Gentleman of the Jury , I am Council in this Cause , for Mrs. Robinson; against whom there is an Indictment for Conspiracy, &amp;c . And the Gentlemen are extremely sensible , I find, on the other Side , if they had laid this Fact without coupling it with a Conspiracy, that it would not have been at all criminal. Our Common Law don't hinder any People from marrying together by any Name they please; therefore, this Conspiracy only must appear to you to be some Injury to some Person or another, and particularly this Gentleman, who says he is so injur'd . I shall heartily agree with the Doctrine that has been advanced by the Gentlemen on the other Side, with regard to this Conspiracy; but that Intent ought to be made plain ; which must naturally arise from the Fact itself, and not by way of Supposition; for 'tis Conspiracy only, as I apprehend, will make it criminal. I should be sorry to advance Doctrines not establish'd by the Law Common, or by Statutes. I never heard , that particular Persons may not marry by whatsoever Name they please. Supposing People were got in Debt, and it was improper to go by their own Names, and they thought proper to marry by a fictitious Name, and this Name happens to with the Name of some Man or Woman; they may imagine they are injur'd: By what Law is any Man injur'd by it? If they could make out that there has been a Combination on purpose to affect the Estate of a third Person, or on purpose to claim that Estate in their Lifetime; then it would have amounted to a Combination together; it would have amounted to a Conspiracy, to injure a third Person: But, is there any thing like it? Was there any Discourse upon it? What they might have in their Heads, God knows! I never knew any human Judicature could reach the Thoughts or Intentions, 'till Facts were made plain and clear .</p>
               <p>As in the Case of the Lottery Ticket, that was argued in this Place some time ago: Any Person living might take it and cut it to Pieces, and make what Alterations he pleas'd, provided he did it without any Intention to defraud any Person .</p>
               <p>My Lord, this is a Precedent of the most dangerous Consequence; and 'tis stretching the Law upon the suppos'd Fancy of an Indictment-Drawer, beyond whatever was known: If this was to prevail , I could mention an hundred Illconveniencies Persons might be brought into .</p>
               <p>Suppose a Person comes into a Room, and there should happen to be a Parcel of Ladies, and he blows out the Candle; Oh! this is a Rogue, and he intends some Attack upon their Virtue : If a covetous Man; Oh, this is a Rogue; he could blow the Candle out with no other Intention but to pick these Ladies Pockets; and all upon a Supposition; whether the Man ever touch'd one of the Women, or ever attempted to pick a Pocket. So the Drawer of the Indictment is to fancy that this is a criminal Thing, tho' no Fact was ever done. I should agree with you, if she had come and said she was actually married, and had declared her Intention , or had she claim'd any Benefit; but to say , 'till that is done, what I had in my Head, you must take upon yourself that Judgment which the Almighty only can , who knows Thoughts; though this might be a Frolick better let alone: But should not a Woman get her a Husband if she can, and the Man get him a Wife; Marriage is honourable in all; and I could wish People would marry one with another and live such Lives as they should do; the contrary is Batchelor's Doctrine. I never heard Marriage should be call'd Conspiracy, because I have a Mind to marry a Woman by a Name not her own; perhaps it might<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150025"/> be some private End of their own, which the World might not know; perhaps there was an Estate depending upon it . I'll imagine there was as well as they: Suppose she should have married a Person by another Name ; it might be because she would not be despised by her Relations, or in Order to pass well in the World. We are bound never to believe Iniquity unless it appears.</p>
               <p>My Lord there is a great Stress laid upon this Habit, this Dress of the Lady's; she was dressed in Sattin, says the Gentleman, a pure white innocent Sattin; a very proper Dress for a Bride. He would conclude from thence, that she was the Person actually married at this Time: There is no positive Evidence she was married, 'tis only grounded on Supposition. She was dressed in a black Bonnet. That is not conclusive Evidence; a Hundred Ladies may wear white Sattin and have black Bonnets, and the same Day one of these Ladies might be married; and yet a young Gentleman, says he, looked at her very narrowly and could see her Face. It was a wonderful Thing; I think it a great Difficulty to distinguish one Woman from another when muffled up; therefore it was no Wonder if this young Spark might be deceiv'd, as his Curiosity was only led by the Size of this Bonnet. Why, Gentlemen, is so great a Stress to be laid on this Habit because it was white Sattin? That might be emblematical of Innocence; there is something of a particular Softness in the Colour, more agreeable to the Touch than rougher wrought Silk, therefore very proper for a Bride; and I believe 'tis their common Dress: Therefore because it was white Sattin, and a Woman had it on, they conclude this must be the Woman .</p>
               <p>My Lord they have gone through a Train of Evidences; but let us see whether this will amount to Evidence. They give you a Narrative of their meeting at the Stable, there was a Box brought, &amp;c. Here's a Gentleman that fills up Mr. Holland's Coat compleatly, but this Man could not fill it up; which Way was that personating him ? for my Part, I am at a Loss to know ; I should rather think that their Intention was entirely otherwise; or he would have had a Coat that should have fitted him better. What say they then, that there came a Box to Casker's, and then sent to Mr. Holland's: Gentlemen, how can you tell but these Clothes might be lent to the Gentlewoman to get her a Husband. I am told she was not actually a Servant, but came there with the Esteem and Approbation of Miss Andrews, she having had the Tuition of her. If Mr. Holland had a Mind for a Person that was agreeable to him, the Clothes might be taken by his Approbation; I have known frequent Instances of Clothes being given, and sometimes lent by Masters. Why therefore this such a mighty Matter, that a Suit of Clothes should go out of the House? How does this manifest an Intention to do him any Wrong? If I have another Man's Suit of Clothes and am married in them, must it be inferr'd from thence that I intended to get his Estate? They might also have said I intended to rob him, or cut his Throat. I cannot, my Lord, for my Heart, conceive why this Person is to claim this Gentleman in his Life-time; it could not be prov'd, she never did it, or said she was the Wife of Mr. Holland; and why should they say it was to affect him after his Death? This is saying a Thing that I might never have had in my Head; this Intention ought to have been manifested by some overt open Acts done; as if a Man shoots off a Gun into a Place where there are an hundred People walking; there he is doing an unlawful Thing, where the People are in the utmost Danger; but is marrying in itself, by another Name, an unlawful Thing ? Is marrying in another Man's Clothes unlawful; I never heard of it; nor I hope there never will be any such Law. I shall say but one Word more in Favour of my Client, which I hope will be sufficient to conclude this Matter: Supposing , for Instance, that she had private Reasons of her own for obtaining a Husband in some Shape or another. I will suppose now, if we are to go upon Suppositions, that she had done something or another that was improper, that she wanted a Husband, and she had a Mind to conceal his Name; suppose she had a Husband to screen her from Debt, and so married him by another Name; every Creditor of her's might say, that she conspired to marry that Man in order to cheat them of their Debts .</p>
               <p>Council. I am Council of the same Side, Please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, to favour me with a few Words: I beg Leave humbly, in the first Place, to say, if they were married, as the other Side insist upon, then an Indictment for Conspiracy must lie against Husband and Wife; in the next Place I shall shew, that there is no sufficient Proof of the Fact: Then again I would observe, that an Indictment for Conspiracy against Husband and Wife cannot stand; and if your Lordship should be of Opinion with that Part of the Indictment; yet, as 'tis laid, I apprehend the Gentlemen have fail'd in Point of Proof; they have proved no Conspiracy at all; as to injuring the Person of Mr. Holland, I apprehend nothing of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150026"/> that Kind has been proved ; and as to an Injury of his Estate, Goods or Chattels, I apprehend nothing has been prov'd, nor against himself, his Administrators , Heirs, Executors, &amp;c. A Conspiracy, in its Nature, must be to do an Injury to a Third, in regard to his Person or Estate. Gentlemen, as to the Fact, where a Person is to be convicted as a Criminal; where a Person is subjected to a Fine or Imprisonment, there ought to be the clearest Proof in the World. As to the Marriage, I don't apprehend any one Person has been capable to prove the Fact, as to the Identity of the Woman; that is the Fact that you are to try: If there is no Evidence of it, in all Cases of criminal Prosecutions, we are to incline to the favourable Side , which is Mercy. As there has been no Injury done to the Person of Mr. Holland, so I apprehend any two Persons may marry, in any Name whatever, without a Crime; or, if it is a Crime, not punishable by an Indictment. If there had been any Claims on Mr. Holland's Goods or Effects, that might have been Evidence of Intention and Conspiracy; but as nothing of that has been prov'd, so it can't be proved any Injury to him: Persons may have particular Ends to themselves in marrying in what Name they think fit; 'tis not that which constitutes the Offence; but it must be done with a Design to prejudice Mr. Holland; and as he has shew'd nothing of that Sort, no Injury can be done to him or his Successors; therefore they have fail'd in this Point.</p>

            : This is laid to deceive Albert Nesbit and Company .</p>
               <p>Council. I am Council of the same Side in support of this Prosecution; you will observe, Gentleman, It is a Prosecution founded on an Act of Parliament made in the second Year of his present Majesty's Reign; 'tis laid upon this Act of Parliament , which has been found a most necessary Law, a Law calculated for the Benefit of Trade; and 'tis a little surprizing that our Ancestors, who were very wise, should not have thought of such a Law, which is calculated for the Conviction and Punishment of so great a Crime as Forgery .</p>
               <p>On the 6th of September last , about Seven o'Clock in the Evening, the Prisoner came to this Part of the Town, towards the Old Baily, and call'd for a Porter; a Porter answer'd immediately. I am a Stranger here in Town, says he; Which is the nearest Way to Coleman-Street? I must get you to shew it me: But just as they were about Bow Church, says he, I want to go to Blossoms Inn; is that far out of the Way? No, says the Porter; then shew me there. Then, said he to the Porter, I want you to carry a Bill to one Mr. Nesbit's in Coleman-Street, and come back to me at the Inn ; if you should not find me there, then you will find me here at Nine o'Clock in the Morning . When the Porter gave the Bill to Mr. Nesbit, he told him it was a good Bill, and he should call To-morrow Morning. As he was coming back to find the Prisoner, he heard some body call Porter ; there the Prisoner lay conceal'd in Lawrence-Lane, he did not care to be at the Inn; for if the Bill had appear'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150027"/> to be bad , he thought a Constable might come. Well, says he, what have you done about the Bill? why they say 'tis a good Bill, so I left it: The Prisoner said, very well. Mr. Nesbit looking narrowly into it concluded it was a Forgery ; he said, this is not Mr. Barton's Hand, nor is it after the Manner they draw their Bills; for they are on Copper-Plate and in French. When another Porter came the next Day they got a Constable and laid hold of him, and ask'd him where he had the Bill; he said he had it from a Gentleman in Whitechapel, who was then waiting for him: Mr. Neshit's Porter and the Constable went to the Place and met with him: They carry'd him before the Lord Mayor where he gave but a very slender Account of ask'd him where he had the Bill; he of one Johnson, and that he gave him Money; but could not tell any thing about Johnson where he liv'd. Gentlemen, I am well brought very home; we shall call our Witnesses, and we don't doubt but you will act the P of honest Men .</p>
               <p>Council. I am Council on the same Side. You will observe this Indictment charges the Prisoner at the Bar with a Crime of a very heinous Nature, no less than Forgery, and of a Species of Forgery that is very pernicious .</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, there is one Difficulty which is a Misfortune to the Publick; that it is extreamly difficult to convict Offenders by positive Proof; Crimes of this Nature are generally transacted in the Dark: What we are to lay before you, and the only Evidence that can be brought, are the Circumstances and Manner of transacting this Bill of Exchange. Gentlemen, the Prisoner at the Bar is no Stranger; he is a Person that has liv'd in the Compring-House of a great Merchant in this City, Mr. Dillon; but when he enter'd upon this Scene of Action, and discover'd himself in this Part of the Town, he told the Porter that he was an entire Stranger, desir'd to know which was Coleman-Street; and not satisfied with his telling him the Way, desir'd he would go with him: When he came into Cheapside he ask'd if it was much out of the Way to go to Blossom's Inn; there he pull'd out the Bill and desir'd him to go to Mr. Nesbit's. The Porter shew'd it to one of the Mr. Nesbit's, who just cast his Eyes upon it and told him it was a good Bill . It seems the Prisoner at the Bar had directed him to come to him to the Blossom's Inn; the Porter returned thither and did not see him; but a Person at some Distance call'd out Porter, and he found the Prisoner at the Bar was behind; upon that he ask'd what he had done, what Mr. Nesbit said to the Bill; he answer'd , Mr. Nesbit said it was a good Bill . I would observe to you, as I go along, that this seems to be an extraordinary Method of negociating a Bill of Exchange ; it is uncommon for a Person to call a Porter in the Street, to send a mere Stranger with a Bill of Exchange to a Merchant . Would it not have been natural to have gone himself to Mr. Nesbit's to have had this Bill of Exchange accepted, instead of loitering about Blossom's Inn? The next Day he thought proper to proceed in a different Manner; then the Scene of Action was open'd in Whitechapel; there he calls a Porter and sends him for the Money, as supporting the Bill accepted: But I should have told you, that Night, or the next Morning , Mr. Nesbit having an Opportunity to examine the Bill, found it was not one of those he used to receive from Barton and Comp. it was different in the Hand writing; and another Circumstance, that Mess. Barton have for many Years had their Bills printed upon Copper-Plate, and fill'd up their Names and Sums in Writing; Mr. Nesbit observing all this to be written, concluded it was a false Bill, and order'd that the Person who should call for it the next Morning might be secured . A Porter coming from Whitechapel for the Hill, Mr. Nesbit's Servant immediately sent for a Constable and secur'd him: Enquiry was then made who he was and from whence he came; he said he was directed to come by a Person who was waiting for him at the

            ; they went thither in search of him, but he had left that House and was found loitering in the Street: Seeing the Porter he went up to him and ask'd him what he had done with the Bill; the Fellow call'd him Rogue, and told him that he had like to have drawn him into a Scape, for it was a forged Bill. The Constable being near at hand seiz'd him and carry'd him before the Lord Mayor; when before his Lordship he said he gave a valuable Consideration for it to one Johnson; but I think at last he confess'd that he knew nothing of Johnson; whereupon he was committed to the Compter, from whence he attempted to escape in Women's Clothes, but was prevented by the Vigilance of the Keeper .</p>
               <p>Here is another Circumstance : He wanted to su one of the Porters to swear falsly; he desir'd him to say, if he was ask'd where he had the Bill of Exchange, that he had it in St. Paul's Church-Yard; which is a Circumstance directly contrary to Truth, and if Wells had swore that, he would have been guilty of Perjury. These are the Circumstances; if we prove them to your Satisfaction , it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150028"/> will be impossible for you to think any otherwise than that this was a false Bill of Exchange. We shall call our Witnesses .</p>

               <p>Q. Which Way did you go?</p>
               <p>Wells. Under Newgate and down Cheapside .</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you as you were going down Cheapside?</p>
               <p>Wells. He ask'd me if I knew Moorgate Coffee-House, and he ask'd if I know Blossom's Inn .</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to you then?</p>
               <p>Wells. He said he had Friend there. I must tell the Whole; I went to Blossom's Inn in Lawrence-Lane, then I went to ease myself .</p>
               <p>Council. What is that to the Purpose. Did he go with you to Blossom's Inn .</p>
               <p>Wells. When we were together in the Gate he gave me a, and ask'd me it I knew such a Gentleman; but I have forgot it .</p>

               <p>Wells. Sir , I can't say; but I think that is one of them. [But that Gentleman was a Stranger.] When I went he bid me return to him at Blossom's Inn; and if he was not there then, I should find him there at Nine o'Clock the next Morning. Before I got to Blossom's Inn the Gentleman was behind me, and called after me, Porter, Porter, what have you done with the Bill? I told him it was a good one .</p>

               <p>Wells. He sent for me to the Compter; to the best of my Memory be order'd me to say that the Bill was given me in Paul's Church-Yard; that I must not say I was at Blossom's Inn with him .</p>

               <p>Nesbit. Sir, this Bill was brought me on Tuesday Night, the 16th of last Month .</p>
               <p>Q. Is Mr. Barton your Correspondent ?</p>
               <p>Nesbit. Yes, Sir; the Porter came for Acceptance, and I told him I believ'd it was a good Bell; that he should call To-morrow, as is usual in those Cases .</p>
               <p>Q. Pray, Sir, What Port er brought you the Bill ?</p>
               <p>Nesbit. Sir, I can't swear to the Porter that came that Night; but this Man came to me about a Week after, and said that he came from the Man in Prison, and he offer'd him 6 d .</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Conversation with any Porter about bringing this Bill to you? You told this Porter that he brought the Bill. Did he tell you that he brought the Bill to you at first?</p>

Yes, he said he did bring the Bill: I told him it was a good Bill, and if they came the next Morning they should have it accepted. When Bills are brought we never accept them the same Day, they always lie for us to examine by our Books .</p>
               <p>Q. Pray how came your Brother so well acquainted with Mr. Barton?</p>
               <p>Nesbit. My Brother lived several Years with Mr. Barton, who never draws a Bill without Advice; and it not being a Copper-Plate Bill, which is usual, increased our Suspicion; so I spoke to all the People of the Compting-House, that whoever came for the Bill the next Morning should be stopp'd; accordingly a Porter came for it, who said he was sent from Whitechapel for that Bill which was left upon the Desk ; he told us that the Man he receiv'd it from was in Whitechapel; so we sent for a Constable ,

               <p>Council . I would ask you whether you afterwards saw him?</p>
               <p>Nesbit. Yes , Sir; the Prisoner at the Bar sent for me to a Publick-House in Coleman-Street.</p>
               <p>Q. What pass'd upon that Occasion?</p>
               <p>Nesbit. He told me had liv'd with Mr. Dillon ; that he had the Bill from another Person, and desir'd the Favour I would not take any Notice of it.</p>

               <p>Q. What pass'd before my Lord Mayor; What Account did he give of himself?</p>
               <p>Nesbit. I think he said he was at an Alehouse at Temple-Bar, with one Johnson, and that he had the Bill of him; that he was a Seafaring Man, and that he had not seen him but twice before.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he afterwards alter his Account of it?</p>

               <p>Whiteing. Last Wednesday was three Weeks, he (the Prisoner) came to me to the Stand where I ply .

I said Sir, I can't think what you mean? he said I had forged a Bill; I said you might as well say I built St. Paul's ; you must go to Newgate; I said I could not make a Letter ; I said, first let me go and find the Man, and when I come almost to the Place the Officer and the Porter shall leave me; as I find 'tis a Cheat, the Man will never come after me.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the Prisoner appoint you to come to him ?</p>
               <p>Whiteing . To Somerset-Street at the Fountain. When we came to Aldgate, then the Constable stay'd behind ; the Officer went down by the Butchers, and the Porter was near the Bars ; I ran hard with my Hands in my Pocket to the Fountain, and asked for a Man that I described as well as I could, but he was not there: Then I turned out of the House, Lord what shall I do ? I clapped my Hands together, I am ruin'd , I am ruin'd, Horse and Foot. When I was running up to the Officer , the Prisoner came out of the Alehouse, and met me in the same Street, opposite Somerset-Street; when I saw him I was as much rejoiced to see him as he was to see me; I suppose he thought I had got the Prize. When I saw him , I laid Hold of him, and said you Son of a B - h , I have caught you; he said, what's the Matter ? I said, G - d R - t you, you had like to have sent me to Newgate for nothing; says the Prisoner, Newgate , for what ? You Son of a B - h, you have forg'd a Note.</p>

               <p>Whiteing . He wanted a Coach, but the Officer would not let him have a Coach.</p>

               <p>Whiteing . He desir'd to go the back Way, and we did. When we came into Coleman-Street, he said he would not go into Mr. Nesbit's, where he was known, for ever so much. We had him to the Swan I think in Coleman-Street, and Mr.

               <p>Wild. Mr. Nesbit's Footman came and ask'd for me; I was at home; he told me I must come up to Mr. Nesbit, and bring my Staff; I begged he would step to a Neighbour that was a Constable, but he was not at home ; so I went, and when I came he charg'd me with this Man; said he must go to Newgate ; the Porter was surpriz'd at first: Soon after he laughed, and said, I forged a Note, I can hardly write a Letter! but he said he would endeavour to find the Man . Mr. Nesbit gave me an Order, if I did not find the Prisoner, I must secure him. I thought it was reasonable, what he (the Porter) said to us of going two and two ; accordingly, the Fellow went into the House, and came out again surpriz'd; says he , he is not there, &amp;c. The Word was hardly out of his Mouth, but the Prisoner came up to him; he laid hold of him, and said D - n you, I have got you. The Prisoner seem'd surpriz'd ; so we took him just by the Bars : He begged for Jesus's Sake he might not be exposed, for he was of a very good Family.</p>
               <p>Q. I would ask you, was there any Discourse about forging a Bill?</p>
               <p>Wild. I told him he was charg'd with forging a Bill.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he pretend to say that he had not sent the Porter for the Bill?</p>
               <p>Wild. He said he could soon clear that up, for he had it of one Johnson, so he pray'd of me that I would not expose him, but take him in a Coach; I did not know whether he would pay for it: I told him I would take him as private a Way as I could. When I came into Moorfields, he begg'd I would go into some House, and said that he would rather go to Hell, than to go to Mr. Nesbit's Compting-House, for there was not a Man there but knew him. I did not care to go into a Tavern, so I went into a little Alehouse, and sent to Mr. Nesbit to know if he would come there, or else I would bring him to his House. When I sent to Mr. Nesbit, he was at Dinner, and said he would come after he had din'd. When Mr. Nesbit came, he behav'd exceedingly submissive; he begg'd for Jesus's Sake, for the Lord's Sake, he walk'd upon his Knees, he would not get up, and pray'd for Jesus's Sake that he would be favourable to him. Mr. Nesbit said, very likely he should; he would consult his Attorney, and if it was necessary , it should be so.</p>

I sent to my Mistress to have him taken Care of, and told him he should not go away to be undress'd 'till Mr. Levi came home .</p>

            (to the Prisoner) You have heard what has been sworn against you to support the Prosecution, what have you to say for yourself?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. This Bill, my Lord, I got from a Man call'd Johnson; he told me he had it from Bristol. He said he was quite unacquainted with what could be done with the Bill, and as it was my Business, he desir'd that I would get it accepted for him; he had it from Bristol: He said he had two other Bills; he said he had it from one Mr. Leroch , of Bristol, and desired I would do what was necessary about the Bill; this was on Tuesday Evening. I told him I thought it proper to send to Mr. Nesbit's, to know if it was good; then he took the Bill in his Hand, and said it was very well .</p>
               <p>[ The Substance of the Prisoner's Defence was this; that his Friend , Johnson, and him, were walking down Cheapside, and then turned into Lawrence Lane ; and Johnson sent the first Porter to Mr. Nesbit's, but that he sent the other Porter from Whitechapel, by the Advice and Direction of Johnson.]</p>

               <p>Hill. Yes , my Lord, I lost a Silver Tankard , and a Silver Cup, that holds almost a Quart.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the Value of the Tankard?</p>
               <p>Hill. I reckon'd it about 5 l. 10 s. and the Cup 4 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you lose them from ?</p>
               <p>Hill. I lost them out of the End of the Grate; they unwired about five of the Wires that binds the Grate round by the other main Wires to keep them together .</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that they did this ?</p>
               <p>Hill. I can't say that I saw them; I had good Customers in the Shop at the same Time, that I can't say that I saw them.</p>
               <p>Q. What Time of the Day was this ?</p>
               <p>Hill. A little before Twelve at Noon; the two Fellows that stole them were taken, Jewel, and the Evidence ,

               <p>Hill. After they were taken, they were brought up to my Shop, and I sent for the Constable, and took them to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. What pass'd when they came to your Shop?</p>
               <p>Hill. They said nothing all that Time. About Seven or Eight o'Clock the Constable and another Neighbour went to them to the Compter, to whom they confess'd several Things. About Eight o'Clock Jewel said if they sent for me, he would tell me what they had done with my Cup and Tankard .</p>
               <p>Q. And what did he tell you?</p>
               <p>Hill. He told me he had sold the Cup and Tankard to a Jew in Houndsditch (opposite the Gullyhole ) for four Guineas and a half.</p>

               <p>Gregory. When he had made this Confession, I said I must search him; he said, if I did, I should find nothing but a Jews-Harp . He said, in breaking the Wires of the Grate, he broke a Piece of the Jews-Harp, and he said, I believe if you go to look for it, you will find it there: He broke a Piece off, and he believed it fell down in the Street, at the Corner of the Shop Window; he believed that we might find it there, if we went to look for it; he said the Jews-Harp belong'd to his Companion,

               <p>Walter. My Lord, I went along with the Constable, about Seven o'Clock, to the Compter, to hear if we could find my Neighbour's Plate. About Seven o'Clock the Prisoner at the Bar began to confess several Robberies ; at length he confess'd about the Tankard and Cup; he said he would not say any thing 'till the right Owner of the Goods was there; and I immediately sent for Mr. Hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Well, did Mr. Hill come?</p>
               <p>Walter. Yes, my Lord, he came presently. As soon as Mr. Hill came into the Room, the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174610150033"/> said, that's the Gentleman that we took the Cup and Tankard from; he was sitting behind the Compter with his Spectacles on, selling some Rings to a Gentlewoman .</p>
               <p>Q. What then ?</p>
               <p>Walter . I ask'd him, my Lord, what he broke the Wires of the Grate with; he told me with a Jews-Harp, and said, if you look under the Grate where I broke the Wires off, there you will find a Piece of the Jews-Harp .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you at any Time go to look for it ?</p>
               <p>Walter. On the 16th in the Morning, about Six o'Clock, I got up and look'd under the Grate, and here's the Piece of the Jews-Harp which I found .</p>

               <p>Aget.

She would not sufler her Fellow Servant to stay in the Room as little Time as possible; she bid her go about her Business, that she was better. This was what her Fellow Servant told me. My Duty call'd me to Church; when I came from that, I enquired how she did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no Suspicion ?</p>
               <p>Aget. Yes, Sir, that Cry gave me a Suspicion. My Servant told me she was much better, and intended to come down in the Afternoon. In the Afternoon she did come down, about Five o'Clock; I saw her do her Business, light a Fire, &amp;c. I then desired my Wife and the Witness, the other Servant, to go up into her Room; there they saw what they thought was sufficient to convince them that there had been a Labour or something like it.</p>
               <p>Court. You did not go up into her Room?</p>
               <p>Agit . I did not then. When they came to me, they said they were very sure there was a Labour, or something like it had been in that Room. She strongly denied it. When nothing could be found in the Room they look'd in every Place where any Thing might be conceal'd: My Wife insisted upon opening her Box; she made some Difficulty and could not find the Key; upon which I told her, her Mistress should have Satisfaction , and if the Key was not be found I would break the Box open; accordingly I took her fellow Servant up with me and did break it open, and there, to my great Surprize, was a dead Child.</p>

             ) Are you a Midwife?</p>
               <p>Jeyne . Yes, my Lord.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you know of this Matter?</p>
               <p>Jeyne . I was sent for on Monday was se'nnight. She was deliver'd the Sunday before; I was sent for to know if she was safely deliver'd. I did not examine her, I examin'd other Matters, and found she was safely deliver'd .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Child ?</p>
               <p>Jeyne. Yes my Lord .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any Marks of Violence on the Child? Was it of its full Time .</p>
               <p>Jeyne. I believe it was, or very nigh, my Lord .</p>
               <p>Court. You that are a skilful Woman, do you think the Child was born dead , or came to any violent Death afterwards ?</p>
               <p>Jeyne. I saw no Marks of Violence: 'Tis impossible for any Body to say it was born alive; for want of Help in Time it might be suffocated, or another Way, thro' the Naval String, or otherwise, &amp;c. I turn'd it before them all, and there were no Marks of Violence found .</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any Thing else.</p>
               <p>Jeyne. The Child look'd just like another Child that should die a natural Death.</p>

            . About Eight o'Clock on Sunday Evening, the 5th Instant, Mr. Aget came to me, seemingly in a very great Fright, he said I must go along with him .</p>
               <p>Q. What are you, a Constable?</p>
               <p>Wheatland. Yes. As we were going down the Street together, he said his Maid was deliver'd of a Child, and he believ'd it was murder'd.</p>
               <p>Q. What then?</p>
               <p>Wheatland. I went up with Mr. Aget and his Wife into the Garret , where I saw the Woman sitting on the Bed, crying prodigiously; I said to her, good Woman are you married? she said yes she was. I says, what Provision have you made for the Birth of this Child? none at all said she; upon which I said to her, it was surprising to me that a married Woman should suffer herself to bring a Child into the World and have nothing to put it in; tell me the Truth I says, are you married or not? she crying still, said at last she was not; I then ask'd her again, have you nothing at all made for this Child, no Linnen whatsoever? none at all she said: I ask'd her who was the Father of the Child; she said a Sailor. I ask'd her what was become of him, she said he was gone to Sea: I afterwards saw the Child, my Lord, in this check'd Linnen Apron. Mr. Aget gave me charge to take her in a Coach to the Compter, which I did, and went with her myself, my Lord, in the Coach, which Mr. Aget paid for; I told the Deputy Keeper of the Compter to put her up warm, for she was deliver'd that Morning: She declared that the Child was born dead, that is all that I know, <rs id="t17461015-23-verdict99" type="verdictDescription">
