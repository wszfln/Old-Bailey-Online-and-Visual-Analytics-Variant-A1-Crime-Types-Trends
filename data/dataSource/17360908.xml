When we came down, we found the Man stamping and making a Noise for his Watch; and before we were admitted, the Man cry'd out Murder: We made them open the Door, and he charged 4 Women with robbing him (Anthill was not then in the House:) We carry'd them to the Compter, and the next Morning before Sir

After they had committed this Fact, they all sted to Ireland, but Ward, who made the Information against Row and Hampton.

            . I was Servant to Mr. Gibson at the Time he was robb'd, and was at work in the Bake house about 2 o'Clock; I went into the Yard for a Scovel which hung on the Backside of the Oven, facing the Back house, Row and his Companions rushed on me, and I was so surprized, that I could not tell how many there were of them: but they presented Pistols to my Breast, and Row stood with a Sword to guard me, while the rest went into my Master. I heard them discharge a Brace of Pistols at him, and I saw the Flash of the Powder. Row afterwards made me go into the Bake-house, and seeing my Master lie upon the Ground, I thought he was dead: he made me stand with my Face to the Oven's Mouth, and took his own Handkerchief, and bound about my Eyes, while the rest went up to rifle the House, They broke open a strong Door of a Chamber, and a Chest of Drawers, and took Money, and what they thought proper. As to Hampton we took him up on Suspicion before, but we could make nothing of him.</p>

I charged the Prisoner with the Robbery, when I took him; he deny'd it at first, but when I shew'd him; Ward's Confession, he said, if Mr. Gibson would make haste and get him over to England, he would be of Service to the Town; and if his Evidence might be admitted, he would make a fuller Discovery than Ward had done: he said, Mr. Gibson might recollect, that he was more merciful to him, than any of the Rest.</p>

               <p>Mr. Unwin. I live in Well-street, near Well-Close-Square. The Prisoner came to me the Sunday after the Horse was lost, about 3 or 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon, and told me he had got 2 Horses, but as one was enough for his Business, he would dispose of the other. One of them was sit for a Saddle or a Chaise: I said, I wanted such a one, and he brought this wan Gelding to me on the Tuesday following, and told me he was worth 5 or 6 Guineas; but if I would buy him, I should have him at any Price. The Horse was in very bad Condition, when I saw him: and I suspected he was not honestly come by. He call'd for Bread and Cheese, and sent me out for some Onions; instead of going for Onions, I got a Constable and had them before Justice Farmer: the Prisoner had a Boy with him, whom I took up too, and he gave me the Information.</p>
               <p>Cox, the Boy. The Prisoner and I had swept the Prosecutor's Chimney, and when we had done, he came to me and fell a Laughing; I asked what he laughed at; why says he, here is a Saddle and Bridle, and there's a Horse in the Church-yard, we'll come at Night and take them away, and go to London. We came about 12 o'Clock, he took the Bridle and Pannel out of the Stable; I held open the Gate; he rode the Horse out, and we both came away together. <rs id="t17360908-8-verdict38" type="verdictDescription">

On the Monday morning before, he went out in perfect health; but that Thursday night, he was very ill; I asked him what was the matter: He said he had received a Hurt on his Side by a Blow, but would not tell me in what manner he received the Hurt: He desired me to let him alone, and said, he would tell me afterwards how it came. I sent for a Surgeon to bleed him about 7 o'Clock that Night; but he continu'd very ill, and in the Morning he told me, if the Pain he was in continu'd, it would kill him: It will make you uneasy if I tell you, how I have been hurt; but if ever I get well, I will right myself. On Sunday night he told me that 2 of their Men had been gaming; that one having lost his Shirt, he pull'd off his, to lend the Looser:

             was the Man, he said, he lent his Shirt to; who refusing to let him have it again, they quarrell'd, and Morris had given the Blows. On Monday I sent to Mr. Bransbury the Apothecary, and he order'd him to be blooded; on Tuesday, he was blooded again, and grew so bad, that he could not lye down in his Bed; but constantly complained of a Pain in his Side. My Dear, says I (the Day he dyed,) do you think the Blow Morris gave you, is the Occasion of your Death? Yes, say'd he. I asked him if I should follow the Law? Do what you please says he, he deserves it; but I forgive him, as I hope to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bransbury. I was sent for on Monday, and found the Deceased complaining of a Pain in his Side, and Shortness of Breath. He seemed very uneasy: I asked if he spit Blood, or made<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173609080005"/> bloody Urine; he said no; he was blooded twice: after which he was easier; but in a Day or two, his Pain return'd, and he could not lie down for the Shortness of his Breath.

               <p>Mr. Bransbury. I apprehend there was an Adhesion of the Lungs, and that it was a consumptive Case. I asked him if he had not drank hard, particularly, if he had not been us'd to drink Drams; and he said, formerly he had, but he had left them off now.</p>
               <p>Q. If the Bruises had occasion'd some inward mortal Disorder, would there not have been some Symptoms of the Disorder, as bloody Urine, spitting of Blood, or the like?</p>

On the middle of the Bridge I met a Man upon a black Horse: I was attack'd by him and another who came up to him; they had each of them a Pistol in their left Hands, and a Truncheon in their right. They made me dismount, and carry'd me over the Gate, into a Field, then put me into a Ditch and searched my Pockets: They took away the Things mention'd in the Indictment, and which I swear to. They gagg'd me and stripp'd me quite naked; my Hands were ty'd behind me, my left Leg fasten'd up to my Hands, and my right Leg lash'd to the other: Then they drew me out of the Ditch into a Furrow, where I lay 'till 12 o'Clock at Night, when a Man coming by released me. I am positive to the 2 Prisoners, for it was light enough to see their Faces; I heard nothing of them, 'till they were taken up for robbing Mr. Hawkins, 3 Days afterwards; then I went to see them, and knew them to be the Men that robb'd me.</p>
               <p>Barns. Dwyer was taken up on suspicion of robbing Mr. Hawkins, and to save himself he desired before Mr. De Viel to be made an Evidence. I was in pursuit of O Neal when my Beadle stopp'd him; and he too desired to be made an Evidence: I have got the Slugs which I drew out of O Neal's Pistols, which we took from him.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 3d of last Month, I was robb'd by the 2 Men at the Barr, about a quarter of a Mile from Stone-bridge, on the Harrow road, about 9 o'Clock at Night. O Neal catch'd hold of my Horse and led him into Mr. Newman's Ground, and Dwyer lay'd hold of me, and led me about 20 Poles length into the Field. Under a Hedge they laid me down; O Neal took 7 Guineas and some Silver from me, and cut off my Silver Buttons; they cut my Coat and Wastcoat down, and took Cloth and Buttons together, and the Buckles out of my Shoes: When they had robbed me, I was going to get up, but Dwyer struck me with his Stick, and say'd, they had not done with me; then O Neal pulled a Handkerchief out of his Pocket, and ty'd my Hands behind me; but before he had done, Dwyer got upon my Horse and rode away with him. O Neal bid me lye still, for he should bring me more Company presently. Mr. Newman met them both upon my black Horse as they were riding off; they rid as far as they thought proper, then turn'd up my Horse, and I found him again.</p>
               <p>Constable. I took these Buckles upon O Neal.</p>
               <p>Hawkins. These are the Buckles they took from me. I heard nothing of the Men 'till Thursday, when a Man came from Turnham green and told me a Man was taken there, with such Goods as I had lost upon him; I went and saw O Neal there, and had him before a Justice.</p>
               <p>Newman. I came from Paddington with Mr. Hawkins: We drank together at Halsden-green; and he went away about half an Hour before me. As I came home, I met 2 Men upon his Horse, within a quarter of a Mile from the Place where he was robb'd, I knew the Horse very well; and O Neal rid hindmost. The next Morning I heard that Mr. Hawkins had been robb'd in my Field, and there my Maid found his Whip: We printed Bills for the Horse; Dwyer was taken and confess'd in hopes of being made an Evidence.</p>

            . The 2 Prisoners lodged in my House in James's street, near Grosvener square. They told me they dealt in Lace and Holland, and carry'd Packs about the Country. They lodged about 9 Days with me, and in that Time they lay out 4 Nights, and the last Time 2 Nights successively: Once when they came home they quarrell'd and fought about sharing some Money, and a loaded Pistol was found in their Bed: My People told me of that, and I went for a Constable to charge them on suspicion; but the Constable would not come without a Warrant; I could not find a Justice at home, so I came back to my House, and found the 2 Men were gone; but Dwyer coming to a Pawnbrokers to redeem a Coat, he was taken up on suspicion of being a Highwayman.</p>

            , Watchman. Between 10 and a 11 at Night, I was going (according to Custom) for my Half-penny worth of Tobacco, I saw the Prisoner knock Chinnick down; Watch was call'd, and away he ran: they ran after him to the End of Russel-street, and would go no farther; I heard him say, the first Man that came after him, he would mow down like Grass.</p>
               <p>Q. This was done very quick: the Watch, and Company came about you, yet your Money was snap'd out of your Pocket, and you was knock'd down again you say; would it not have been natural for a Man to have said he was robb'd then?</p>
               <p>Chinnick. I don't swear the Man had my Money: I lost so much Money, and I felt his Hand in my Pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the Prisoner taken?</p>
               <p>Chinnick. About 7 Weeks after.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. When he was before Justice Midford for a Warrant, he swore only to an Assault: I don't deny I had a squabble with him.</p>

               <p>A Woman. I was going by when the Quarrel happen'd: I saw Chinnick strike the Prisoner, and throw him down; he got up again and they fell to Blows; after that the Prisoner went away, there was no Watch call'd at all, as I heard.</p>

            . I drove Mr.Hasswell the 23d of July, and looked back 6 or 8 Times, as they follow'd the Chariot. I saw their Face as plain as I see the Prisoners now, and several Times, before they put their Masks on. I took them to be 2 Persons going home. and expected no Robbery. Several times I observed their Faces, and I swear that the Prisoner is one of them, for I took notice of his Voice, as well as his Face; he speaks thick and hastily. The Prisoner was the Man who came up and swore he would shoot me, if I did not stop; I up with my Whip, and was going to strike him, but I did not; and the third time of his swearing at me. I stop'd: then he turn'd about and demanded Mr. Hasswell's Money: the other Man was at this time putting on his Mask behind the Chariot, and the Prisoner cry'd d - n ye, d - n ye, come up to the other Side, shall we see what the Coachman has got, because he would not stop the first time we bid him Wager bid me look forward, and Bonner say'd, why don't you see what the Coachman has got; says Wager, the Coachman does look forward: I heard him (Wager) say, D - n you, where is your Watch, and I saw the Watch delivered into his Hand, and Bonner took the Money and the Ring, and Wager had the Watch. Then they left us and went 2 or 300 Yards towards the Turnpike in the green Lane. We told the People there and Bonner came after us, and called out, D - n his Blood where is the Coachman, Why don't he go about his Business. There was 2 or 3 Men in the back Yard, and I asked them for a Gun: I got one, and Bonner cry'd out to me, Why don't you go on? I clapp'd the Gun to my Shoulder, presented the Peice, and cry'd out, Now I have you. Bonner then fell from his Horse, but got up again, and made clear off; but was afterwards taken by some People who knew he had haunted these Lanes for some Days, and knew both him and Wager to be such sort of Men.</p>

I took him at the Black-Spread-Eagle Alehouse in Pater noster-Row, on the Information of the Coachman, in a dark Room, and 2 or 3 Women were with him: we took him to Sir Richard Brocas's, but he not being ready, we had him to the Bull-head, till the Alderman could give us a hearing: he seem'd very uneasy, and I was uneasy too; while we were there, a lusty Carpenter one of his Associates, and 2 or 3 more came in, and Bonner said to them, " have you " brought Pistols and Hangers? If you have, " fall to, fire, and away:" however, I got Bonner to Sir Richard's first, and because we cou'd not get the People there, he was to be re-examin'd; and when we got the Coachman and him together, that they might see one another, the Coachman said, " out of a thousand that is the " Man, I remember his quick Speech." Bonner was in his Butcher's Livery, and he asked the Coachman if he knew him: Aye, says the Coachman, if I had never seen you, I should have had no Trouble with you then he described Wager; and Cocky is the most remarkable Man in the World.</p>

I live at Endfield wash, am a Butcher I came to Smithfield, - in June, - in July, aye in July it was; I am no Scholar and please you, my Lord, - but I came to buy a Bullock: I brought it, and up comes Mr. Bonner, how do you do says he? How do Mr. Bonner says I. What have you bought a Bullock says he; will you go in and drink says I? Yes says he. I bought the Bullock of a Customer I deal with; I paid him for it, and paid him 10 l. I ow'd him. Mr. Bonner was with me and saw me pay the Money; it was in July, and we were in Company together 5 or 6 Hours.</p>
               <p>Q. And what then?</p>
               <p>Wells. He was in my Company and saw me pay the Money that's all.</p>
               <p>- Story. I am a Butcher; I was in Smithfield along with the Gentleman, - the Gentleman at the Barr, at the Sign of the Greyhound; I saw the Gentleman drinking there the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>Q. How come you to remember the 23d of July.</p>
               <p>- Story. Because it was Market Day, and Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. But there are other Market Days, are there not?</p>
               <p>- Story. I took notice of that Day.</p>
               <p>Q. Why?</p>
               <p>Story. Because I was that Day at Market, and I have not been there once, since that time. I saw Master Wells pay for the Bullock.</p>
               <p>Q. So you happen'd to be in the Market, luckily at the Time that Man was paying for the Bullock? Bonner was there by accident, and you too?</p>
               <p>Story. I knew nothing of Bonner, 'till I saw him drinking</p>
               <p>Q. Then you was by, when the Bullock was paid for?</p>
               <p>Story. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the Money paid to?</p>
               <p>Story. Master Wells paid it to a Farmer, his Name is Foiler, and he lives in Essex. I have nothing more to say; it was the 23d of July, and I have been but once since in Smithfield, this was about 11 o'Clock, and we stay'd there 'till 4 or 5. I said there all the while, and this Woman was drinking there too. I want in and out 2 or 3 times. I know it was the 23d of July; and I can give no other Reason, but that I was there the 23d of July.</p>

            . I live at the Greyhound in Smithfield.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know one Wells, a Butcher?</p>
               <p>Broughton. No. If that is the Man, I don't know that I ever saw him in my Life before.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect that any such Persons as these, were at your House the 23d of July? Do you know one Foiler of Essex?</p>
               <p>Broughton. No, but I can tell by my Books, whether such a one paid for a Bullock: I take the Money, and set it down in my Book, for the Grasiers: they don't take the Money themselves; I have my Book, at home, and the Man must tell me who he bought the Bullock of: I don't remember that ever I saw these 4 People in my Life.</p>
               <p>Broughton's Servant. I know nothing of any of them. I cannot recollect that any Persons sat at our House that Day 4 or 5 Hours about selling a Bullock.</p>
               <p>Q. Do any of you know Foiler?</p>
               <p>Broughton. No.</p>
               <p>Mr.Maynard. I have known the Prisoner 20 Years, he is a <rs id="t17360908-33-deflabel142" type="occupation">Butcher</rs>

               <p>Q. (To Broughton) Do you remember you had any Company on the 23d of July, that staid in your House 4 or 5 Hours from 11 o'Clock?</p>
               <p>Broughton. No. </p>
               <p>Broughton's Man. Nor I. ( Here the Books from the Greyhound, and the Hostler were sent for.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Maynard. The Way of paying Money in Smithfield is thus, the Money Taker receives the Debt the Master does not give the Receipt, but the Money Taker gives it; 'tis set down in his Book, and he gives the Receipt.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Wells) Where does Foiler live?</p>
               <p>Wells. In the Hundreds somewhere. ( The jokes are produced. )</p>
               <p>Broughton. On the 23d of July, I have but 2 Beasts sold, in my Book; and here's none of Foiler's Name.</p>
               <p>A Juryman. If the Money had been paid in your House, should you have enter'd it in your Book?</p>
               <p>Broughton. I should, if it had been paid to me: but there is another who takes Money at my House, and he lives in the Burrough,</p>
               <p>Hostler. I have liv'd at the Greyhound ever since Candlemas; I don't remember that ever I saw any of these People before.</p>
               <p> Another Witness. Wells I am inform'd harbours these Sort of People, he keeps a Butcher's Shop, and publick House at the rising Sun, at Enfield Wash.</p>
               <p>Wells and his Wife, Story and Lyon were committed to Newgate. Bonner <rs id="t17360908-33-verdict143" type="verdictDescription">

(Sunday Morning) he knock'd at the Door; I had no body in the House then, but 2 Children about 8 or 9 Years old; he was let in, and he went directly to my Bureau, call'd me Bitch, and said if I took the Law of him, he would cut my Throat, or get 50 People to swear my Life away; he then took away the Gold Watch, and the Diamond Ring, and a Bank Note of 40 l and 5 Shirts of the Orphans.</p>
               <p>Q. What Pretence did he make for this?</p>
               <p>Sayer. None at all; he took them violently. And on the 24th of April, he arrested me in an Action of 140 l. tho' I never had seen a Farthing of his; and while I was at the spunging House in Grocer's Alley, my House was broke open, and all he Things mention'd in the Indictment, were taken away. I could not prosecute him sooner, because I have been in Custody; and when I had my Liberty, I heard he was gone to Holland.</p>
               <p>Councel. Pray did not you keep a publick Coffee House; and did not the Prisoner, and you live together as Man and Wife? did not you both receive Money of your Customers?</p>
               <p>Sayer. No: he was only my Lodger; I kept the House in my own Name.</p>
               <p>Councel. At whose Expence was the Coffee House fitted up? Did not he pay the Money?</p>
               <p>Sayer. He did pay a Man in the Name, and for the Use of Elizabeth Sayer. I always gave him the Money, he never paid any Money of his own for me.</p>
               <p>Councel. I ask you if he did not pass for your Husband?</p>
               <p>Sayer. No, never. He had a Wife in Sheer Lane.</p>
               <p>Councel. Why did he lodge at your House then?</p>
               <p>Sayer. He took a Room to screen his Goods, and he would lodge there himself, as it was his own Lodging.</p>
               <p>Councel. I ask whether this Quarrel did not arise from his reprimanding you about your Daughter's keeping Company?</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She sold her Daughter's Maiden-head to one Major Lewis of Deptford for 100 l. he is since a Bankrupt, and she got none of the Money. She pawn'd a silver Spoon of mine to buy a pair of Sheets, she pawn'd even her own Looking Glasses. She says she did not know where to find me before; but my Lord, she was on the back of a Bill last Sessions as a Witnes against me for a Conspiracy against one Drinkwater, and this Drinkwater has charged my Wife (while she was attending on me here) with a Robbery, and she is taken into Custody by one Hicks an Officer.</p>
               <p>Drinkwater. In the Year 1734, I was Servant for about 6 Months to the Prisoner as a Drawer. - Hicks the Constable was call'd.</p>
               <p>Q. Who gave you the Warrant to take this Woman into Custody, while she was attending her Husband.</p>
               <p>Hicks. This Man was one: There was 2 Men and 2 Women with him.</p>
               <p>Warwick's Wife. I saw Drinkwater give it the Constable, and then he took hold of my Arm.</p>
               <p>Drinkwater. I was Drawer at Warwick's House in Sheer Lane; he kept a very Disorderly House. Sayer came to him to advise with him about her Administring, and he advised her to make a forged Will, and asked me if I had a Will of any bodies, to make it by: but I would not be concerned. Afterwards he said, one Day, G - d d - n this silly Bitch, she has got Money, I must contrive to get it from her; I will get a Lodging in her House, make her drunk, and so get it from her; Good by Molly, says he to his Wife, I must go from you for 6 Months, to get the tall Man's Effects from the Bitch. What will you do with the Children say'd she: I'll send them to Sea, says he, so the Prisoner and his Wife parted, that he might rob the Woman.</p>
               <p>(The Court order'd Drinkwater into Custody, for taking his Wife while she was attending her Husband's Business in the Court; and the Constable was reprimanded.)</p>

When she was in the spunging House, she sent for me; I told her I would see Warwick. and know his Demands. He told me he had disbursed Money on her Account, and would release her, if she would pay some Debts on Account of the House, which amounted to 11 or 12 l. She offer'd me the Lease of her House for Security, if I would pay this Money; I paid the Money, and had the Key of the House to take Possession; she desired me to take care of her Goods, and I went accordingly to the House, supposing I should find it lock'd up, but I found Warwick there, and he told me he got in at the Cellar Window; the Goods were taken down; some were carry'd away before I came, and some, while I was in the House. Warwick told me then, he had the Woman's Authority for what he did, and that he was to take care of the Goods.

               <p>Orr. My Lord, I will endeavour to do it. August the 4th at Night, I came to the <placeName id="t17360908-59-crimeloc237">Hamburgh Coffee House in Drury Lane</placeName>

After a pretty long Walk, coming to my Lodgings in Clare Court, near Covent Garden, at this Coffee House I call'd, not knowing the Character of the House. I stay'd there to refresh my self, and had a little Punch. I paid my Reckoning, was coming away, but being a little grip'd. I call'd for a small Dram. (Reading.) I committed my Thoughts to writing, having time to do it, and am better able to express them in that Light; and I humbly conceive (my Lord) it will set the matter clearer. I put my Hat and Watch upon a Chair, in the Room where I was sitting.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a publick Room?</p>
               <p>Orr. It was a publick Room: The following Part of my Declaration, will shew both where it was, and how. Being a little grip'd, I call'd for a small Dram, and then a Girl came up.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not you say you was in the Publick Room?</p>
               <p>Orr. It was a publick Coffee House, I made no scruple of going up Stairs, because I've known such Houses to have Rooms above, for reading News, and private Letters. I was in a private Room; tho' I don't know but all the Rooms are publick in some sort. On calling for a Dram, the Prisoner came up Stairs, I bid her make haste, and fetch it to me. My Watch and Hat were lying by me then upon the Chair between me and the Door. The Girl took up my Watch, and run down Stairs; immediately I follow'd her, and took hold of her at the Foot of the Stairs, and demanded my Watch. She desired Money before she'd give it me; first half a Guinea, then a Crown, then Charity because she was poor. I judg'd a Prison or a Workhouse fitter for her than that. There was no Bed in the Room, and I can assure you, on all the Principles of Honour, I called there thro' Innocence and Ignorance. Ignorance with Regard to the House, and Innocence with Regard to myself: I called for my Watch, none answer'd; I contested with the Girl, in Order to have my Watch again. Carney was near her; whether she deliver'd it to him when I came down, or how it was convey'd from her, I know not. That Night I thought it expedient for me to go away, but I came again next Morning. I desired the Mistress of the House to get my Watch again, or I would have a Warrant, and take them all up. She said she knew nothing of the Watch, or who the Person was; but afterwards she own'd the Man, her Servant; the Girl an Attendant on some Occasions. I had a Warrant on Suspicion for the Woman of the House, but when the Constable came, not a Woman in the House was there. I came several Days after to find my Watch; Carney, the now Prisoner at the Barr, said he would see, and help me to it, in a little Time. A Day or 2 after this, I came again, to see if he had any Notice of it. He said 'twas pawn'd for a Guinea and a half, and that with 18 d. would soon redeem it. I desired him to carry me to the Pawnbrokers, that I might be sure it was my own, then I'd redeem it. He said then I might swear Felony against the Pawnbroker, and would not do it: saying, he would fetch it in 3 Minutes Time. This made me suspect he had a hand in detaining the Watch. He said he had seen the Girl, and she had put her self in better Order, and had bought Cloaths with the Money, commending her for her Industry. On this, my Lord, I brought the Constable to take the Mistress of the House, and Girl if found. I charg'd the Constable with the Prisoners at the Barr, and carry'd them to Justice Midford, and he on the Evidence given, thought proper to commit them. A few Days afterwards, the Watch was found at a Pawnbroker's, pawn'd in Carney's Name for 6 s. I gave the Constable the Marks, by which with Certainty he might know, if it was mine: we found it so; I went to see it, at

               <p>Barret. Yes, 'tis very true.</p>
               <p>Orr. Did not you (to the Pawnbroker) own, that he pawn'd it at twice for 3 s. and 3 s.</p>
               <p>Barret. Yes.</p>
               <p>Orr. When did he pawn it?</p>

            . I went to serve the Warrant upon Burroughs, at the Coffee House, but when we came there the Girl was gone. I bid Mr. Orr charge me with the Fellow; he did, and I carry'd him before Justice Midford, and there he say'd he knew nothing at all of it. I enquired of the Pawnbrokers in th' Neighbourhood, and found it at Barret's. The Woman of the House directed me to find Burroughs in Lincoln's Inn Fields; I took her and carry'd her before the Justice; there she own'd that Carney took the Watch from her, and when she desired him to let the Gentleman have it again, he d - d her for a Bitch, and said he should not have it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your Business, Sir?</p>
               <p>Orr. I am a private Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Carney. Ask the Gentleman if he is not a Parson?</p>

               <p>Orr. I don't see that will affect the Cause at all; I am a private Gentleman.</p>
               <p>Carney. A Clergyman may be a private Gentleman: I desire he may Answer?</p>
               <p>Orr. I don't conceive he has a Right to that: I have the same Right of Prosecution if I am, or am not.</p>
               <p>Q. He has a Right to enquire, and if he insists upon it, you must answer his Question, you hear Sir, what it is.</p>
               <p>Orr. I am not a Clergyman. I live in America: I have been here 3 Months, and this Fall I return to America again.</p>
               <p>Burroughs's Defence. I was coming up Drury Lane about 9 o'Clock at Night, and at the Corner of Princes Street, that Man stopp'd me, and ask'd me, if I would drink a Glass of Wine: Thank ye, Sir, says I, so he carried me to the Hamburgh Coffee House in Drury Lane; we went up Stairs; and he called for a quartern of Brandy; we staid there some Time, and then we called for a Bottle of Cyder: Then he told me if I would have some Concerns with him, he would make me a Present: After this he pull'd out his Watch, and having no Money to pay the Reckoning, he gave me the Watch to pawn for 6 s. there being no Body else in the House, I gave Carney the Watch to pawn for him; he went and brought 3 s. what do you bring this for? says I, you should have brought 6 s. I thought, says he, you said 3 s. so I sent him back for 3 s. more; he had 1 s. for Porterage, the rest of the Money was paid into the Gentleman's Hand. And the very next Morning he came and demanded his Watch.</p>

            . I am Servant to Mrs. Lee at the Hamburgh Coffee House; the Prosecutor and the Prisoner came in about 9 o'Clock: the Girl came in first, and the Prosecutor follow'd her. He called for a Room: I took a Candle off the Barr, and li't them both up Stairs; he call'd for Wine, then a Gill of Brandy, I carry'd it up my self, 'twas Cherry Brandy: I came down, and in some little time the Bell was rung again; I went up, and he spake for 18 d of Punch: I left them an Hour or better; then he called for Cyder, and then a Gill of Brandy, then call'd to pay, and the Reckoning was 3 s. and 6 d which he gave me. Then they both came down Stairs; and my Mistress being gone to a Neighbour's Mrs. Hill took care of the Barr, and the Prosecutor went up to the Barr, and spoke to her: they had a Tiff of Punch, and drank it at the Barr, Hill, Burroughs and the Prosecutor. Then Burroughs and he went up Stairs again, and they had 18 d of Punch again; I carry'd it up, and heard him ask Burroughs if she call'd to stay with him all Night? Yes, says she, if you'll make me a Present, but not else. He said he would not desire any Woman's Company for nothing: what he had was little, but he would make her amends some other Time: he pull'd out 3 s. and 6 d. and some Half-pence, but the Girl did not care to oblige him for that: he had a silver Watch, (he said) which he would leave at the Barr, for half a Guinea; the Prisoner told<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173609080017"/> him the People there did not take Pawns, but said he might leave it with her for half a Guinea; well (says he) I have a Friend hard by, will redeem it for me next Morning; so I came down, and heard no more. In a little Time they both came down Stairs again: I went out, and saw no more of them that Night.</p>
               <p>Carney. Ask her whether she did not see the Prosecutor put the Watch into the Woman's Hand to pawn that?</p>
               <p>Clark. I was in the Room, when the Watch was in her Hand, but I can't swear he gave it her. She hold it publickly in her Hand, and after that, I saw it lie on the Table.</p>

            . On a Thursday Night, in the latter End of August, the Woman Prisoner, and the Prosecutor came into this Coffee House: the Woman first, and he follow'd her immediately; they both desired to be li't up Stairs; Mary Clark li't them up, and they call'd for Liquor, but I did not mind what: They staid an Hour, or an Hour and half: Then they call'd for the Reckoning and paid it. The Woman of the House being sent for out, I look'd after her Barr, and in a little Time, the Woman and he came down Stairs: He stopp'd at the Barr, to speak with me: He asked me to drink a Glass, of Punch with him; I said I would if he pleased, so he desired me to make it. He told me he was a  Foreigner, a Crelian and asked me to drink a Dram, after the Punch; we drank a Glass of Rack, and for Punch and Rack, he paid half a Guinea. He told me he had now but little Money left, but says he, I don't live far off. I told him the Servant should call him a Coach. and told him London was a sad Place - if he had no Money: Madam says he, I will not have a Coach, nor will I go home: Tho' I have not Money, I have Money's worth, and if you'll give me your Company to Night, I'll leave my Watch with you, 'till next Day. I said, I never went with any Gentlemen farther than the Coffee Room, and never took Pawns on such Accounts; he importuned me: Said he liked me better than the Girl, and if I would consent, he would give me Satisfaction: He begg'd of me not to be so unkind; but I refusing, he said, well, I must return to my former Girl: I left that to his Discretion, and up Stairs he carry'd her again, and staid half  Hour: Then the Prisoner came down a Step or two before him, and in the Coffee Room, he took hold of her and said he would have his Watch again: She said with all her Heart, if he would give her the half Guinea he had promis'd her. He call'd her Hussy and Slut, and said he would not stay with her all Night; No matter that for says she; you have had my Company, and shall be as good as your Word. He took fast hold of her Coats, and said she should not go. Well says she, if you won't stay with me all Night, give me a Crown. He would give her nothing, and would have his Watch too. I thought he would have torn the Cloaths off her Back. I asked him how he could use the poor Creature so unkindly, To have her Company and give her Nothing: Says I, if I had given you mine, I suppose you'd have serv'd me so. I threatned to call the Watch, so they both went out of the House together; but, it seems, he let her go, and came back to the Woman of the House and insisted on her making good his Watch. After many Words he went away, and came again the next Day, or the Day following, and enquired after the Girl: I told him he look'd like one that would take more care of his Conscience, than to charge her with Felony, when he had had her Company, and when he knew he had offer'd it me upon the same Terms. He said he had been put in a right way, and if he had not his Watch again, he would swear a Robbery against us all.</p>
               <p>Orr. My Lord, I humbly conceive, as she can swear so well, that she will answer some Questions as well.</p>
               <p>Burroughs. Pray, Sir, did not you lye with me? - Upon your Oath.</p>
               <p>Orr. Upon my Honour and my Oath, my Lord, I did not.</p>
               <p>Burroughs. My Lord he did, against a Chair.</p>
               <p>Orr. I touch'd her no way on the Face of the Earth, except when I laid hold of her Petticoats; and upon my Honour and Oath, I made no offers to Hill, nor did I drink any Punch at the Barr. (To Hill ) was I drunk or sober, Madam?</p>
               <p>Hill. I took you to be sober; you talk'd in the same serious manner, that you do now.</p>

            . The unhappy Gentleman at the Barr, was recommended to me, on his first coming to England to learn English. I live at Chigwell in Essex. On Saturday the 28th of August, he was in London, and a Person came down to me, with a Letter without a Name, as from the Prisoner, for some Papers; he told me he had got the Key of his Room; but as there were Things of value in the Room, and no Name was to the Letter, I sent for a Neighbour, one Cotton, who keeps the Stage Coach, and we all went up; the Messenger found the Paper, so we locked the Door and gave the Key to the Messenger; this was Saturday Night; and on Sunday Morning about 6 o'Clock, Major General Franks and

            , came down to search his Room for a Diamond Cross; he broke open the Door, and they felt in the Pockets of the Cloths which lay in his Bed. I told them, there could be nothing there, for I had searched there last Night for some Papers, but (I told them) there were more Cloaths in the Press; we open'd it and searched a pair of Black Velvet Breeches, with Gold Buttons, and out of one of the Side Pockets, the Jewel was taken.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the Prisoner go to London from your House?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. The Monday before; he had been about a Week in London.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you searched those Breeches (in which the Cross was found) the Night before for the Papers?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. I looked no farther than into the trunk, for the Messenger found the Paper he wanted taking within some Tape, the inside of the Lid.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any Directions in the Letter, where the Papers were to be found?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the Letter, the Prisoner's own Hand writing?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. I cannot tell. (The Prisoner own'd it .)</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I sent this Letter, in order to have a Bill of Exchange delivered me out of the Trunk, but the Paper the Messenger took, was only an Order for Post Horses. (Clerk reads the Letter.) At Chigwell, Essex, For Mr. Brockwell. I desire you to go into my Room, and give the Bearer the present Paper.</p>
               <p>Brockwell. I did not know what Paper it was, nor the Man neither; but this being the first Paper I li't of, I read it to him, and he said, this is the Paper; and away he went. He told me the Gentleman was under Misfortunes, and in the Gatehouse, and that Paper was to let the World know, who he was. He told me the Prisoner desired me to come up next Morning to bail him; so I did not give the Man the Paper, but thought to carry it up my self: next Morning General Franks and Mr. Moreau finding the Jewel in his Breeches, prevented the Delivery of the Paper.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he wear those Breeches?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. I don't know; he had such a variety of Cloath, that I cannot remember.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Has Mr. Brockwell ever observed any thing blameable in my Behaviour or Conduct?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. No, never; he always behav'd like a Gentleman.</p>

            , both lodge in my House; I hear in the Morning at Eight o'Clock the 26th of August, his Excellence complain he lose his Cross; he speak very low to his Servant, but I hear: and I went to him, in his own Chamber, and I ask, when he saw it: he say the very Morning before: he tell me he saw it: just the Day before, the 25th, when I went to the Races at Barnet: I ask him, who was in the Chamber? He say, none but Monsieur Latour. I ask, have you Suspicion, he took the Cross? He say. I open my Bureau, he ask for a Paper there. I leave de Bureau open, and go into mine Chamber to dress. When I came back, he ask me to walk in the Park; Sir John tell me, between the Time he was gone to dress, Monsieur Latour take the Cross. So he go to General Frank, and tell this General Frank come at 10 o'Clock at Night, the 26th, and persuade his Excellence to take Warrant immediately: the General and his Excellence go to Justice Cotton, he grant a Warrant; this was Friday Morning. The Prisoner went to Chigwell that Night, came home again on Saturday Morning. I ask him if he have been at Chigwell? He tell me No. I find he changed Stockings, Breeches, Wastcoat and Wig. I ask him if he have Cloaths in the City, and he tell me, yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What Cloaths had he on when he went to Chigwell?</p>
               <p>Moreau. Green Coat, Flannel Wastcoat, Velvet Breeches, and gold Buttons: this he had on when he go from my House the Friday Night, 5 o'Clock, and he come home in plain Breeches, no gold Buttons.</p>

               <p>Brockwell, I was not at home, but I heard he had been there.</p>
               <p>Q. To Moreau. Did you see him on Saturday Morning with plain Breeches?</p>
               <p>Moreau. Yes; before I go to the Races, he come home, between 9 and 10 in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to take such particular notice of his Breeches?</p>
               <p>Moreau. He come home, with the same Coat, not the same Wastcoat, and different: Breeches; I ask him whether he have been at Chigwell? He tell me no; but then he take me into the Yard, and say to me, I have been at Chigwell, you not say any Thing of it; and he give me 3 l. 12 s. to change; I sent to change it, and he pay me some Money, he owe in the House. I am ver' sure they were plain Breeches, and they was tore between the Legs. the Breeches he had on before was not tore. I say nothing to him, because General Frank and his Excellence was gone to the Councellor, to take him up. At Night my Wife tell me, he was took up, in the Gatehouse; I go to him, and come home, and tell the General; he go to Chigwell, but he say, Moreau, you say nothing of that; so General Frank have a search Warrant to search his Cloaths at Chigwell; (before the Justice, he deny he was there,) and his Excellence being weak, not go himself, but desire me to go with the General; we had search Warrant back'd by Justice Gold, and we come to this Gentleman's House, at 6 Sunday Morning; he tell us the Messenger was gone, and not take the Paper, and he shew us the Paper, and it was only about Post-Horses from Calais, and his Name not in the Paper. We desire Mr. Brockwell when he come at 6 o'Clock Sunday Morning, to let his Room be search; so he broke open the Door with a Hammer, and when we come in, he say, all these Cloaths I search yesterday for the Paper; and by and by we come to the Press, the Parson take the Breeches from the Press, and he throw'd them on the Bed; these are the Breeches, I say, and I feel about, in this manner, and put my Hand so, - and I feel something, and I say here is something, and I put my Hand in the Pocket, and take out the Cross - just so - a few Days after he was in the Gatehouse, he sent an Attorney, to ask for one Bill of Exchange that was in his Pocket; I say, the Gentleman is mistake; the Gentleman, the Attorney, he say, it was in the Breeches, so we look in the Breeches, and we find this Paper, a Bill for 70 l.</p>
               <p>Brockwell. I know nothing of this; they took the Breeches, and the Cross away with them.</p>

            . I went to shift my self (I cannot name the Day) and left the Prisoner in the Room. I remember I took a Paper out of the Bureau, and left the Key in it; the next Day I missed the Cross; I went with General Franks to an Attorney, got a Warrant, and found it in the Prisoner's Pocket.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not Moreau, and his Servants frequently came in your Chamber?</p>
               <p>Sir John. No. I apprehend no one could go into this Room but the Prisoner.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. How long was it left open?</p>
               <p>Sir John. Only while I went into another Room to shift me.</p>
               <p>Another Witness. I was in the Country the Night Latour came down; he came on Horseback, without Boots; about 7 or 8 o'clock, he sat down to Supper, but seemed very pensive, and did not eat; he said he came for a Bill of Exchange, and next Morning he rid to London. I took no notice of his Breeches but he came down in whitish Stockings, and next Morning went up in dark Gray. I was present when the Cross was took out of his Pocket; and the Account that has been given, is exactly true.</p>
               <p>Q. (To Brockwell) Did you, or this last Witness lay Hands on the Breeches, and feel them before Moreau?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. No; no one felt them but he.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your Eye fixed on them from the Time you handed them to the Bed, 'till Moreau took the Cross out?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. I think it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you think it was not possible for any thing to be put into the Breeches?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. I cannot answer that; I have seen many things done by Legerdemain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Gentleman want Money then?</p>
               <p>Brockwell. I believe he did; for he had been 3 Months at my House; and when I asked him for Money, he had none.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner gave a long Account of his first coming to England, and that his Acquaintance with Sir John began in Moreau's House, where they both lodged; that the Morning the Cross was lost, there was a Master of Languages in the Room with them; and when he opened his Cabinet to take out the Paper, he said he would leave nothing in it, because Moreau was a Rogue, and had a false Key.</p>
               <p>Sir John denied this; and being asked if he had any suspicion of Moreau, he said, no.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Sir John has said so, in the Presence of a Man that lodges at Moreau's, and who came with him this Morning to this Place.</p>
               <p>Moreau. I do not know the Man's Name, nor where he is.</p>
               <p>Several Persons appeared to Moreau's Character, as an honest Man.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was not left in the Room, but went with Sir John into his Dressing Room. Sir John dedenied this.</p>
               <p>The Reason the Prisoner gave for his Journey to Chigwell on Friday Night, was to satisfy Mr. Brockwell about Money due to him; and he informed the Court, that he could not make a proper<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173609080020"/> Defence, because he was brought unexpectedly to the Barr; he having the Night before given 5 Guineas, a Gold Watch, 3 or 4 Embroidered Wastcoats to the Persons concerned in the Prosecution; and a Bond with a Penalty of 300 l. to Sir John, to make up the Affair (which Bond was produced and read in Court.) He said, they told him, he need not provide any Counsel or any Attorney; and farther informed the Court, that his Attorney had engaged Counsel in his Cause, but the Prosecutor sent notice to him last Night, that the Matter was compromis'd, and that this was the Reason he had no body to appear for him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Compton. My Clerk told me, such notice was sent; and I was much surprized when I found Mr. Latour was called to his Trial; if I had known it, I should have feed Serj Haywood. I had Instructions to call a Person, who was to speak to Moreau's having a false Key, if I had been prepared.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this Prisoner committed?</p>
               <p>Keeper of the Gatehouse. The Commitment is dated August the 27th, which was on a Friday; he came into my case the Night of the same Day, about 10 or 11 o'Clock.</p>
               <p>Q. Moreau swore he was at Chigwell that Night.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. 'Tis a little odd, that they should not search my Boxes in Town, before they went down to Chigwell.</p>
               <p>Moreau. They were searched, as I have been informed; I was not at home.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. They demanded 200 Guineas of me; then they fell to 100, then to 50, and there the Matter stuck. <rs id="t17360908-63-verdict253" type="verdictDescription">

I am a Butcher in Newgate Market; going home thro' the Bell Inn, I saw Mr. Freeman and Sealey together in the Yard; Freeman call'd out to me, and asked me if I would go and drink a Glass of Wine: I said, I did not care if I did. He took me to one side, says he, this Sealey has got a good deal of Money, if you'll play a Game at Cards, I will go your our halves: We went directly over to the 3 Tuns next the College of Physicians, and call'd for a Pint off Wine: We drank half a Glass a piece; then they two went out into the Yard by themselves, stay'd there 4 or 5 Minutes, then they came in again and asked for a Candle: This was about 1 or 2 in the Afternoon, and on the 5th of March last. The Candle they said was to go down to the necessary House, and their going down to the Vault together, made me think they were gone to contrive how to win my Money: I wanted to hear what  they were saying to one another, so I went softly down, and got almost down to the Door, within a Step or 2 of the Vault Door; and I heard Freeman say - here he used an Expression which implied a Sodomitical Intention; but there being a Candle in the inside of the Vault. I went nearer, and put my Eye to a Crack in the Door, and I saw Freeman bending; his Knees were on the Ground, or very near; one Hand by the Side of the necessary House, his Breeches down, and his Shirt up, that I could see half way up his Back. Sealey had his Breeches down. - (Here he mention'd several Circumstances shocking to Nature, not fit to be repeated.) I was frighted and walk'd up Stairs softly; I ran into the Market, and call'd Freshwater; we ran back again, and

             seeing us run, follow'd us; Freshwater went down Stairs, and he will tell you, what he saw. The next Morning I went before Alderman Billers, and got a Warrant for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an Account of the Situation of the Place?</p>
               <p>Palmer. The little House wants a Step or 2 of the Bottom of the Cellar, and the Door opens directly fronting the Seat, and except they have alter'd it, there is a Crevice down the Middle. With respect to me, they stood Side-ways; and Sealey was behind him, but not between Freeman and the Door; Freeman's other Hand was against the Wall, or the Boards, and Sealey stood shoving behind him; if they both had not been sideways to the Door, I could not have seen them. After they came up Stairs, Freeman sat down by the Fire, and there was as much - (Here he swore positively to the Fact, attended with lewd Discourse and unnatural Circumstances). I heard Freeman say this once or twice, - twice it was; for I heard him before I put my Eye to the Crack, and once afterwards. I have 20 Gentlemen of good Consideration to my Character. I have no more to say.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I think you say, the first Thing you saw, was with relation to Sealey.</p>
               <p>Palmer. Yes, Freeman was Patient.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I find you have some Notion of the Thing. Pray when the Vault Door opens, don't it<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173609080021"/> touch the Edge of the Seat? What Size is this Place? Is it possible for a Man to lie down, his Legs extended behind him, and another to stand there too?</p>
               <p>Palmer. Why here's Room enough for a Man, to stand behind me, and do it, in this very Place, (where the Witnesses stand) and the Vault is bigger than this.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Had you never any Conversation with Mr. Hodgson on this Affair?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I had some talk with him.</p>
               <p>Counsel. In that Discourse, was there no mention of Cuttings and Turner?</p>
               <p>Palmer. Mr. Freeman had a Trial with Turner at Guildhall. Cuttings and Turner came to me, and wanted me to go with them to Guildhall; I would not go without a Subpoena. I went, but never was called.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Had you any Discourse with Mr. Hedgson, more than once about this Affair?</p>
               <p>Palmer. He came to me once or twice, about my not prosecuting Freeman, the same Month the Fact was committed.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Then I ask you, if you did not say, you had no just Cause to prosecute Freeman?</p>
               <p>Palmer. No, I did not. I only told him I had no quarrel with Freeman; I owed him no ill-will; and I do this in justice to the Publick.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Have not you applied to him; in order to have Money?</p>
               <p>Palmer. No, never in my life, neither to Mr. Hodgson, nor Freeman.</p>
               <p>Counsel. How long have you known Freeman?</p>
               <p>Palmer. Eight or nine Years.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Is he marry'd?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I believe so; he lives with a Woman, and has two Children.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Did you ever hear any Imputation of this kind before?</p>
               <p>Palmer. No, never.</p>
               <p>Counsel. How does he live with his Wife?</p>
               <p>Palmer. Very friendly with her.</p>
               <p>Counsel. I ask you, if you do not know that he is very fond of his Wife?</p>
               <p>Palmer. I never saw him quarrel with her in my life.</p>
               <p>Freeman. Did Freshwater go down?</p>
               <p>Palmer. Yes, and I saw him push the Door open little by little, 'till to my thinking he could get his Head in: The Door was neither locked nor bolted.</p>
               <p>W. Freshwater. I know both the Prisoners: Freeman is a <rs id="t17360908-67-deflabel269" type="occupation">Butcher</rs>

He trembled like an Aspen Leaf, and told me he had seen something he never saw before in his life. At the Cellar Door, he said to me, Colonel, Colonel, listen, listen: I heard a humming, and went down three or four Stairs and came up again - by G - d, says I, there's something the matter, more than ordinary: I went down again, and heard a jumbling of the Vault Door, I came up, and said to Vincent, by G - d they are b - g one another: I went down again, and pushed the Door inwards, softly, it gave way a little and a little by degrees. When it was opened far enough, I put my Head in, and saw them, the Candle stood on the Left-hand side of the Seat. Sealey lay with his Breeches down, near the Seat of the Vault, and they were pushing one another very close; Freeman's Breeches were down likewise. I pulled my Head back, and the Door clapped too, then I was in the dark. I felt about and found a little Cask, I got upon that, and looked over the Partition, where there was a Slip of a Board broke off, I put my Head over, looked in, and saw Freeman's - Here he gave much the same Evidence as Palmer as to the Fact.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Have you never been applied to, to give Evidence in this Matter?</p>
               <p>Freshwater. Yes, I was subpoena'd to give Evidence in a Trial between Turner and Freeman at the Common Pleas.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Have not you declared you knew no ill of Freeman?</p>
               <p>Freshwater. I did say I knew no ill of him 'till this 5th of March: I said I would do nothing to his Prejudice, except I had a fair Subpoena.</p>
               <p>Counsel. How many People will this Vault hold?</p>
               <p>Freshwater. Why, if there's Room for one Man to go into it, and shut the Door, it will hold two Men on such Business. Two large Men may go in, one may go in first, and the other may get in when the Door is half way open.</p>
               <p>W. Vincent. I know the two Prisoners. I saw the two Witnesses run through the Bell Inn, and I followed them to the Wine Cellar, but when I got to the Door of the House, Palmer was standing at the Top of the Cellar Stairs: He points to me to keep back. I wondered what they were at, and presently up came Freshwater, and swore they were at it. Afterwards he told me in a Fright, Tom Freeman and Sealey were b - g one another, and he went down again. I do not know how the Light stood, but I saw the Light of a Candle, and I went back into the Kitchen, and then Freeman and Sealey came up. Freeman I thought was a little in Liquor, and Sealey very much. There was something on Freeman's Apron, but I cannot say what it was. On the Top of the Vault there is a Board or two out, and a Man may put his Head in. The Place is so big, that Mr. Edwards and I have been in it together, and I believe two more might stand in it.</p>
               <p>Freeman's Defence. I stand indicted for a most horrid Crime, it is a Shame to express it. I never was in the Prisoner's Company but that Day. He bought Meat of me, which came to four Shillings and ten Pence Half penny; I sent it to the Bell Inn where his House stood; my Servant came back, and said, the old Man would not pay for it: I carried it to him my self, and asked him for the Money: We drank together, and I agreed to trust him 'till next Market Day; but he went away without paying his Share for what<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173609080022"/> we drank at the Bell Inn. The Man of the House advised me to go after him for the Money. I went, and he told me if I would go with him to the Wine Vault, he would pay me, and give me a Pint of Wine. We had been drinking Ale and Brandy, so I call'd Palmer to go with us; and we 3 drank a Pint of Wine: Sealey would not pay for that, but he said, if we would play at Cards he should get Money to pay: Upon this he went out into the Yard, and according to Palmer's Directions I followed him to get him to play. He wanted to go into the Cellar he said, but could not find the Vault: The Maid gave him a Candle, and I followed him down and sat upon the Stairs untill he came out. When we came up, they never charged us with any Crime, but Palmer called me on one side, and said, we'll be even with this old Son of a B - h, we'll go the Fountain Tavern thro' Newgate, call for a Pint of Wine, and leave him to pay. We all went there, and came away; leaving the old Man behind us at the Tavern.</p>
               <p>Next Morning I heard it was reported I had b - g - d Sealey. I sent for Vincent to the White Horse in Warwick Lane, and desired him to tell me what he know of the Design. He told me Palmer and Freshwater had raised the Report; then I will sue them says I. In the Morning a Man told me, that Spratley had advised Palmer to swear it, and told him if he did so, I could not sue him: Palmer swore it, and my Friends advised me to keep up Stairs. I never heard how the Matter stood. 'till Mr. Edwards told me, I must go with him to execute Releases with Palmer and Freshwater. On the 10th of April, Mr. Turner call'd me Buggerer, I su'd, and cast him: he got acquainted with one Cuttings a Soliciter in the Old Bailey, and they 2 gave Mr. Salter Directions to draw the Bill for Sodomy against me. Palmer declared he gave no Directions at all, and Freshwater declared he knew no hurt of me. After the Bill was drawn, Cuttings insisted upon their swearing and gave them Subpoenas. Mr. Edwards hearing this, went to Cuttings and Turner, and to the Man who swore against me. Freshwater told him, that Cuttings and Turner were the Men who would him joyn in the Bill. On the 6th of July, Palmer told me that Trade was so dead, he must make a Demand upon me; and says he, you know upon what Account: Twice they sent for me to the Magpye, but I would not go. One Thursday I over-heard Turner and his Wife quarreling about some Money, and he told her he had been in company with Cuttings, Palmer and Freshwater; and says he if you'll give them 5 Guineas a piece, they'll swear so, as to hang Freeman. And on Saturday July 12th, Palmer told me that Cuttings and Turner offer'd me 5 Guineas to swear, and unless you'll give me 5 Guineas I will; I bid him swear and be - d; Afterwards he told me, tho' I would not give him 5 Guineas, Mr. Edwards would; I got Constable and took him up, and he fell on his, knees and declared he knew no hurt of me.</p>

            . In February or March, I had word brought me of this Affair; the Prisoner Freeman marry'd my Sister, therefore I concerned my Self in it: I sent for him, to my House, and he gave me the same Account, he has now given. I blamed him for keeping Company with such Scandalous Persons as the 2 Witnesses, who are reputed Gamesters, and their Characters bad I advised him to stop the Report, by making the matter up with them; telling him, it was a Shame such a Thing should be brought before a Court. He said, he was innocent, and absolutely refus'd. I desired him to leave it to me; he said I might do as I pleas'd. I sent for Freshwater, and en-quired of him concerning the Fact; he told me he saw them plainly in the Vault; but says he, I have not sworn nor will I if you'll be civil. I expect something, if I do not Prosecute. Then I went to Palmer; he told me he had sworn, but he was sorry for it; he did not desire to hurt him, but the Butchers in the Market, had urged him to it. Palmer told me he was willing to make it up, if he could do it safely, for he knew no hurt of Freeman; and I took the Expression to be without any Exception. I was uneasy about the other Prisoner Sealey, so I took my Horse and rode to Bushy to enquire his Character, and I found all his Neighbours gave him a very good one. Sealey's Wife told me, it was impossible the Charge could be true, and gave me a Reason, very convincing, that it could not be. After this, Palmer and I, and his Lawyer had several meetings at the 3 Tunns in Wood's Close; one Time he insisted on 15 Guineas, and said if some People had the Job, they would make 20 or 30 of it: But after many Words, we agreed for 5, to sign General Leases, and I was to be at all the Expence. I paid the Money, and the writings were executed. Then I went to Freshwater, but he'd do nothing without his Lawyer, who lives at the Goat Alehouse in Long Lane: We all met at the Vine in Gray Friar's; Freshwater said, he had no design to Prosecute, but he wanted Money to defray the Charges of a Bastard Child, he had at Hitchen. He said he'd leave to my Honour, what he should have: I bid him come to my House; he came, and I gave him a Guinea and a half. Some time after, Freeman and Turner having been at Law, Palmer told me at the Gentleman and Porter in Shoe Lane, that he was bid 10 Guineas to swear on the other side: Cuttings and Turner, says he, have been with me, but if you'll give me as much, I had rather have the Money from you. I told him, I thought we had made an End before; but if this Money would certainly be the last, I would give it. He said, he must have 5 Guineas that Night, I told him he should have it; but after we had made this other Agreement, they took Freeman up.</p>
               <p>After the Trial between Turner and Freeman, Freshwater declared he would not come against Freeman any more, and asked me for a Guinea, says he, I have had but a Guinea and a half yet, and 'tis very hard, if I can't make a little more Money of this than what will just defray the Expence of a Bastard<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="173609080023"/> Child. I said I was weary of parting with my Money so; then says he, let me have half a Guinea, I refused then d - n ye, says he, it shall be the worse for you, and so we parted.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Tho' Palmer and Freshwater said they knew no Harm of him, had you no suspicion of his being guilty, that occasion'd you to give your self all this Trouble, and to throw your Money about, in order to have it hush'd, and made up?</p>

               <p>Mr. Hodgson. Mr. Edwards, sent for me to his House, and there I found Freshwater. I asked him some Questions and he said he might make a good Advantage of this Affair, for he had seen them. Mr. Edwards was for making it up, and asked him where he might see Palmer, for he had left the Market. Freshwater said he could not see him, unless he went with him: he agreed to carry us to him, and at the 3 Tuns in Wood's Close, a Gentleman saw Palmer. This the beginning of March. I asked Palmer how the Fact was committed; he said they went down together, privately to play at Cards, and I saw them in the Vault together, and the Candle, but I saw no farther Action. I acquainted Mr. Edwards with this, and the next Orders I had from him, were to meet him at the same Place with Releases. I went there, and found Mr. Edwards, Palmer and Freshwater, Palmer's Wife and another Gentleman. Mr. Edwards went into another Room with Palmer's Wife, and when they return'd Mr. Edwards asked her before the Company, if she was satisfy'd: she declared she was satisfy'd; and on that the Releases were executed.

The next Notice I had, was from Mr. Edwards in Rose-street; he told me Freshwater had proposed to make an Affidavit, that he knew no Hurt of Freeman; upon Cuttings and Turners sending for him to swear against Freeman at the Old Bailey. I drew up an Affidavit, and at an appointed Time, met Mr. Edwards and Freshwater. In the Affidavit Freshwater declared, that Cuttings and Turner had been with him several Times about this Business. The Affidavit was read over twice to him, and he made several Alterations in it; and then read over to him literatim and distinctly.</p>
               <p>The Affidavit was produced and read.</p>

            . I employed the Prisoner to get in some Debts for me, and in July, I don't well know the Day, he was looking on my Hand in our Kitchen, and says he, you have a very beautiful Ring, let me see it: then he took hold of my Hand, and took it off my Finger; Madam, says he, there is a Noise at your Door, and up he got, and away he ran with it. I met him next Day in the Minories, and he told me I should have it again. I looked after him for half a Year, and then I gave him over.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Madam, don't you remember the Day, you and I were at Well's, the Cooks, in Leadenhall-street, when you and I had Pig for Dinner? I have been a little foolish in loving your Sex too much; but, pray Madam, have not you own'd, you would never have taken me up, if I had not told your Husband, that you gave it me for a Merry Bout you and I had together? Don't you know that Charlesworth was to bring an Action against me for Criminal Conversation with you! Did not you declare, you was obliged to take out a Warrant against me to please your Husband?</p>
               <p>Priscilla London. What I said, was, that you was a good for nothing Man, and when I heard your Wife say, that you and I were gone together, I said to my Husband, now go and take him up for the Ring. You made no Ring but a laugh of me, and bid me kiss your -</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not your Husband come to my House and offer to make it up for 6 s.</p>
               <p>Priseilla London. I heard that you offer'd 6 s.? but my Husband would not agree. I did go to the Justices to have it decided, but you had no Money to pay for Stamps, nor general Releases.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Did not you agree afterwards to make it up again for 14 s.</p>
               <p>London. Yes, my Husband had your Note for 14 s but he flung it to you again, at the Justice's.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. She keeps a Baudy House in Squirrel Alley; I'll prove you gave me the Ring at Wells's a Cook's in Leaden-Hall street, where we din'd together; then I went home with you, and you and I drank 2 or 3 Drams together. Don't you know when you met me in the Minories the next Day, that you said, My dear, do you intend to keep the Ring, or have one made, and I said, my Dear, the Ring is safe enough.</p>
