               Clipping the Current Coin of this Kingdom
            </rs>; there were several Instruments found in a Trunk in her House, as Files and Rubbing-stones, but no Sheers, but a pair of Weights and some Clipp'd Money were found. Another Evidence was one of the Prisoners Maids, who Swore that comming into the Kitchen, she saw the Prisoners Arm move up and down as if she Clipp'd Money or somewhat else like it; and that she saw both Broad Money and Clipp'd Money lie before her, but she could not say that she saw any Shears in her Hands, neither did she see her actually Clip: But another Witness Swore that she saw not only the Money, but a pair of Shears lie by her, and some Clippings, some of which were produced in Court, and a pair of Scales and Weights, and after she heard a snapping of Shears: There were other concurring Evidence in the matter, who swore plainly to the matter of Fact aforesaid, and the Bag of Clipp'd money was produced in Court, which was very rough, being newly Clipp'd.</p>
               <p>The Prisoner urged that her Servants had been hired to convey such things into her House, and that she new not how the Bag of Clip'd money came there, (and that Nurse who was her Servant and had Sworn against her) had Robbed her of a Pillow-beer, a Frock, and a Set of Window Curtains, which the Prisoner owned to be hers: Another Evidence on the Prisoners side, swore that the Nurse declared that she must go out of Town and abscond her self, for that she had stolen some things from her Mistress, and she would Prosecute her for the same, therefore she feared her, &amp;c. Some other Witness said that they had dealt with the Prisoner and took good money of her, and that they never knew any evil by her. The Prisoner still urged her Innocency, and declared that the Bag of mony which proved to be Clipp'd, was left at her House, by one

That the said Mr. Pitts and two or three more Gentlemen, being drinking at the Young Devil-Tavern in Fleet-street, Mr. Hoyle was sent for, who came, and after some time, Mr. Hoyle, without any Provocation, began to talk very scurrilously against the present Government, and spake very unbecoming words against the Person of King William, whereupon Mr. Pitts replied, That he was very hard to be pleased if this King would not please him who was now hazarding his Life for Us, and Mr. Hoyle continuing to rail against all Government, Mr. Pitts endeavoured to perswade Mr. Hoyle to lay by such discourse, but he would not, but gave the Prisoner, Mr. Pitts, very unworthy Language and provoking Words, calling him Coward, or to that effect, thereupon Mr. Hoyle and Mr. Pitts rising up, Mr. Clarke (one of the Gentlemen in the company) put himself between them, and desired Mr. Pitts to be pacified, then said Mr. Pitts (Mr. Clarke) pray take my Sword, for you know it is not fit for a Gentleman to hear this Language with a Sword by his side, then Mr. Hoyle went away, but after a little time he came back again, and forced himself into the company, and then gave the Lye to Mr. Pitts three times, when he said nothing to him, whereupon Mr. Pitts told him this is meer Madness, and took the Glass and said here's to you Mr. Hoyle, and drank to him; then Mr. Pitts paid for the Wine and went away, and Mr. Hoyle and the rest followed him, after this there were some Proposals made of a Place to Fight on the Morrow, and then they two going along the street together, (the other two Gentlemen going towards Temple-Barr) when they came over against the <placeName id="t16920629-35-crimeloc185">Temple-Gate</placeName>

Whereas, on the contrary, Mr. Pitts called seven Peers, and several Persons of Quality, who satisfied the Court that Mr. Pitts had always been a Gentleman of a very obliging, peaceable, quiet and moderate Behaviour in all Company, no ways given to Passion or Revenge, and the Prisoner himself did very affectionately declare that he had no manner of Antipathy, against Mr. Hoyle, nor never but once before was in his company, and that what he did was in his own defence, for which great Misfortune he was heartily sorry, for he did not intend any such thing that happened: He produced the Gentlemen who were at the Tavern with him, and saw all that passed, who gave a fair account of the matter of Fact, as aforesaid, which was of great Satisfaction to the Court, how that Mr. Pitts was much abused, Mr. Hoyle calling Mr. Pitts, Poultroon, Rascally Coward, &amp;c. telling him his Sword was Rusty, with such like aggravating Language, &amp;c.
