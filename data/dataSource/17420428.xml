They took from me my Watch, and 4 or 5 s. in Silver, or something more, and then made off towards Ratcliff. It was a very dark Night, and I was very much frighted, so that I can't say that I know any Thing of the Persons. My Watch was afterwards offer'd to pawn to Mr. Warner, in King-Street, near Tower-Hill, and after making some Enquiry, I found it there, and had it again.</p>
               <p>- Cresswell. I live with Mr. Warner. On the 20th of October, the Prisoner Wood brought this Watch to our House to pledge. He ask'd a Guinea upon it, and accordingly had it. About three Days afterwards he came for the Watch, and had it out again. On the 27th of October he brought it again, and had a Guinea and half upon it, and he never came to enquire for it afterwards.</p>
               <p>Pris. Wood. I bought this Watch at a public House: I humbly recommend it to your Consideration, that if I had stolen the Watch, I should not have pawn'd it in my own Name, and in my own Neighbourhood.</p>

               <p>Pris. Wood. According to the best of my Remembrance, this Gentleman said before Mr. Deveil, that he took my Name down, and where I liv'd, and when he found the Watch was stolen, why did he not send and secure me?</p>
               <p>Jacobson. I took no Account where he liv'd: he told me he came up to Town with the Lieutenant to see after some Men who had run away from the Ship.</p>

            . The Prisoners being arrested, they sent me with another Woman to fetch the Watches out of Pawn. Craycraft desired Mrs. Carter to give a Letter to this Gentleman. I saw him deliver the Letter to her; it was seal'd up, and the Purport of it was, to desire the Gentleman to let us have the Watches, by the same Token, that one of the Prisoners had fetch'd a Hinger out of Pawn about a Week before. Craycraft said one of the Watches was his, and the other Mr. Wood's, and he hop'd the Pawnbrokers would let them be sold for more Money, or else buy them themselves. We went according to their Direction to these Pawnbrokers; but one of them had carried the Watch home that was pawn'd with him: and the other Pawnbroker refused to deliver his to any Person but the right Owner.</p>

            . I am an Officer and arrested the two Prisoners for a Debt which they had contracted. I kept them at my own House the twenty-four Hours, which I had a Right to do, and then I was for carrying them to Prison. They told me, they had some Watches and lac'd Waistcoats in Pawn, and desired me to keep them a Day longer at my House, that they might sell them, and make it up with the Plaintiff. They had no Money, so I ask'd them what they would leave me for what they had eat and drank at my House? they said, they had a Brace of Pistols which were lock'd up in a 'Scrutore in their Lodging, but the Landlord would not let me have them. I then carry'd them to Goal, where they remain'd about six Weeks, and then were discharged. After this, Mrs. Richards fell out with them, and inform'd me of a Letter which she had carry'd concerning some Watches, and Jacobson telling me where he had deliver'd one of them, I found out the Prosecutor, who gave me an Account of his being robb'd. Upon this, I got a Warrant against the Prisoners, and they immediately flew from the Place which they frequented in Wild street, to Deptford, where I took them. I call'd Wood into a Corner, and ask'd him whether he had not better save his own Life and make a Discovery? He told me, he could not hang two, for what Robberies he had committed, were with Craycroft alone.</p>
               <p>- Rose. On the 7th of March, Mr. Barnes and I went to Deptford in Pursuit of the Prisoners, and on Monday Morning between 9 and 10 o'Clock, we were waiting in a Yard, and saw them go by the Door. We went after them and took them into a Public-house. Barnes took Wood into a Corner of the Room, and ask'd him if any Body else was concern'd with him, and he said, he never was concern'd with any body but Craycraft.</p>
               <p>Wood. Did you find any Thing upon us when we were taken into Custody?</p>
               <p>Rose. No.</p>

I gave Pigg a Shilling to fetch some Bread and Beer, and he went to an Alehouse, but came back again without it, and told his Wife they were coming to search. I was then cutting out one of the Sheep in a little Closet, and his Wife desired me to stay and not leave her alone. She gave me some Carpenter's Tools to carry out, and I dropp'd them at the Door, and met a great many People coming to search for the Sheep. I walk'd pretty leisurely 'till I got past the People; and when I got out of Sight I ran, and made the best of my way for Staines, and as I was going across the Moor, I met with Pigg, and we went together to one Clements's, at Grubb's Hill in Surrey, and Carpenter the Prisoner came there to us. I can't say that I remember any particular Discourse between us, but Pigg went on the Sunday following to see his Wife and was apprehended for this Fact.</p>

            . The Prisoner is a Tenant to me at Limehouse. I sent a Man to clean out a House of my Brother's which was empty, and he informed me that the Boards were pull'd down between that House and the next, so that a Man could go out of one House into the other. He told me there was some Wooll, and part of a Hide, but he could neither make one thing or t'other of it. I ask'd him how long he thought it might have been taken off the Sheep ? He said he could not tell. Upon this I acquainted the the Butchers in the Butcher row of this, and we appointed to meet hard by Limehouse Church. The Prisoner generally was out in the Day Time, so Mr. Wigans and I went into the empty House to view the Skin, but we could not make any thing of it by the Marks. We then got a Candle and look'd down the Vault of the empty House, and saw a Sheep-skin at the Bottom of it. After this we got a Warrant from Justice Jones, and went to the Prisoner's Lodgings, designing to search there, and accordingly I endeavour'd to go into one Room, but a Woman who was there refus'd to let me come in. I then went up Stairs, but finding nothing, I came down again, and pull'd back the Spring Lock of the Room Door, into which I had been refus'd Admittance, and went in: there I saw three Parts of five Sheep cut out; this was in the Room on the Ground Floor. I likewise search'd a Cup-board on the Stairs, and found a parcel of Fat, which I suppose belong'd to the Sheep that were cut out as I have mentioned.</p>

            . On the 17th of April, the Prisoner desired me to go down with him into the Marsh at Poplar. It was between 9 and 10 at Night, as near as I can guess. He laid a Plank over the Ditches, and we by that means got into the Field. He then caught a Sheep and kill'd it, after which he took out the Guts and ridded the Fat and put it into a Bag. After that he cut the Sheep in halves, and put one half in one Bag, and the other half in another. Then we went over the Plank again and brought it Home.</p>

I knock'd at the Door and ask'd him for the Money: he told us, his Girl had burnt the Trunk which it was in; but he pulled down a little Box like a Chest of Drawers, and produc'd this Money. I told him he had better return it; but he refus'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280007"/> to deliver it to me, so he went with us to the Watch-House, and laid down 19 l. 13 s. in the Prisoner's presence, and said, that was all he had; the Prisoner answer'd, No, Mr. Loveit, you have more.</p>

We were very industrious in enquiring after her at several Places, and at last we took her in Kent street, and carry'd her before the Constable in the Watch-house, and upon searching her, these Things were found upon her. When this Money was taken out of her Pocket, she said that was all the Money she had: I ask'd her what she had done with the rest? for it was but two Days after the Robbery, and there was 60 l. 9 Shillings lost in all. Robinson inform'd me, that the Prisoner had given the rest of the Money to

I told them my Master King was gone into the Borough and so my Fellow Servant and I went with Anderson, and took the Prisoner in the Boot Alehouse. She made her Escape from us, and got into Boot Alley, and there we took her again, and brought her to the Watch-House. We found in her Pocket a 3 l 12 s. piece, a 36 s. piece, a Guinea, and some Silver, and the Mob was upon her Head when we put her into the Cage, but she afterwards took it off, and gave it to Mr. Anderson. We then went to Loveit's, and he brought the rest of the Money to the Watch-House.</p>
               <p>Pris. Loveit and this young Woman got me in Liquor, and they both held together to take the Money from me as soon as I had got it.</p>

             I was in the Room when the Thing happen'd; it was on the 15th of April, the Deceased came into the Room where the Prisoner was drinking, with a Pretence for some Salt, and he accordingly went to the Salt Box to take some out, which I believe was with a full Intention to quarrel with the Prisoner. There were some Words between them, and the Prisoner got up and gave Gilchrist a Push towards the Door, and bid him get out of his Company. Gilchrist then came back again, and the Prisoner a second Time desired him to quit his Company; upon that, Gilchrist hit the Prisoner a slap on the Face; they immediately clos'd, and fell on the Floor together. They had three Falls in the whole, one of them was over a Chair, and in the last Fall, some how or other, Gilchrist got the Prisoner's Finger in his Mouth, and bit it, and the Prisoner endeavouring to disengage his Finger, had his Thumb bit too. After this, they both got up; the Prisoner went home with his Mother, and the Deceased sat down in a Chair in the same Room 'till he return'd. The Prisoner (when he came back) offer'd to call for a Tankard of Beer to drink Friends with Gilchrist, but they did not drink together that I saw. Mr. Gilchrist about 9 or 10. Minutes afterwards, complain'd that he was sick, and went home with a Neighbour.</p>
               <p>C. How long did he live after this?</p>

               <p>C. Did you see any Bruise upon him?</p>
               <p>Heap. I did not see any thing that could hurt either of them.</p>
               <p>C. You say when Gilchrist came into the Room for Salt, the Prisoner gave him a Push ?</p>
               <p>Heap. I believe he came with a full Design to quarrel, for by enquiring afterwards, I found he had nothing to eat with his Salt; besides they had Words before, and the Prisoner had left his Company the same Day. Neither of the Pushes could hurt him, and he was not hurt by him to the best of my Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Was there not a Sash Door going into the Kitchen, through which Gilchrist could see whether I was there or not?</p>
               <p>Heap. Yes.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Did I desire him to go out of the Room.</p>
               <p>Heap. Yes; he gave him those Pushes, and desired him to walk out of the Room, for he did not care to keep him Company. I heard the Prisoner declare (the Day before this happen'd) to Gilchrist himself, that he never would come into his Company again if he could help it. I have known the Prisoner some Years, and never knew him quarrel with any Body before. As to Gilchrist, here are People that knew him better than I. I never saw him but 3 or 4 Times in my Life, and never drank with him.</p>

There is a Sash-Door which parts it from the public Room. When I had been there about a Quarter of an Hour, the Deceased opened the Door, and came in: he push'd between the Company, and went directly to the Salt Box. As he was going back again, the Prisoner told him he was a Scoundrel, and gave him a Push on the Elbow, such as would not knock down a Child of a Year and half old if it could stand: he bid him get out of hit Company, and repeated his Push, and presently after that, they said Gilchrist struck the Prisoner, but I being behind, did not see the Blow; however, they presently clos'd, and threw me, Chair and all down to the Ground. They got up again, and the Deceas'd fell against the Table, and from thence a-cross a Chair.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the Prisoner do any Thing to him when he was down?</p>
               <p>Hayes. No, the Prisoner bid him get up, and said he scorn'd to take any Advantage of him; accordingly the Deceased did get up, and they clos'd and fell a second Time upon the Floor, the Prisoner uppermost: there were no Blows that I perceiv'd, and I was as near as any body could be. They were not down a quarter of a Minute, but they got up and clos'd again, and fell a third Time, the Prisoner uppermost again. Then Gilchrist got the Prisoner by the Finger, and in loosing that, he bit his Thumb, and then they both got up again.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you not see any violent fighting and Blows ?</p>
               <p>Hayes. No, only hugging one another and falling.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did not the Deceased come with Violence against the Table?</p>
               <p>Hayes. Yes; they both came against the Table.</p>
               <p>Pris Q. Had the Deceas'd any Occasion to come into that Room at all?</p>
               <p>Hayes. No; for I ask'd all the People of the House whether he had any Thing to eat, and he had not. I can't say what his Pretence was for coming in, but I really believe it was to quarrel, because he peep'd over the Curtain to see if the Prisoner was there. I have known the Prisoner from his Cradle, living in the same Neighbourhood: I never saw him quarrel in my Life, but he behav'd always civilly. As to Gilchrist, when he was in Liquor, there was not an iller Temper living, and they tell me, he had not been sober 2 or 3 Days, and he seem'd to me to be a little in Liquor then.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Do you apprehend any Hurt could proceed from those Falls?</p>
               <p>Hayes. No, I don't apprehend there was the least Damage in the World.</p>

            . I believe Mr. Gilchrist was the first Occasion of this Quarrel, because he open'd the Door, and came into the Kitchen. He went directly to the Salt Box, took some Salt, and in his Return back, stood facing me and 2 or 3 more who sat on the same Bench. The Prisoner said, get out of my Company, what do you follow me for? you Scoundrel ! He was then sitting on his Seat, and told Gilchrist if he would not go out, he would shove him out, and he then gave the Deceased a Push and he fell into a Chair. The Prisoner again bid him go out; he said he would not, upon which he gave him another Push, and he fell down again. The Deceased<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280009"/> got up, and gave the Prisoner a slap on the Face, upon which they immediately clos'd, and some how or other the Deceased was shov'd into a Chair. The Prisoner said, get up you Scoundrel, for I will not take any Advantage of you; he then got up, and they both clos'd and fell more.</p>

               <p>Counc. Did the Prisoner seem to have any Prejudice against the Deceas'd?</p>
               <p>Smith. None at all, but the Prisoner, as I was told, absconded his Company that Day in the other Part of the House, and went into the Kitchen to shun him. I saw no more than one Blow, because I had hold of the Prisoner's Mother, and I did hear one or two more, but I did not see them.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you hear the Deceased make any Complaint ?</p>
               <p>Smith. He made no Complaint at the House, only cryed out, he has hurt me. I went home with him, and carried him up Stairs, and sat him in a Chair by the Bedside. He told me his Belly was hurt, and he liv'd after this between 25 and 26 Hours.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q What do you apprehend he went to get Suit for ?</p>
               <p>Smith. I don't apprehend he had any Occasion for it, but that he came in on purpose to quarrel. I have known the Prisoner about a dozen Years, he always behav'd well, but he was not sober at this Time. As to Gilchrist, he was when sober, a peaceable, good-natur'd Man, but when he was fuddled, as bad as bad could be, and he was then very drunk.</p>

            . I was one of the Company, and was drinking in the Room when the Deceased opened the Door and came in. He went directly to the Salt-Box, and turn'd back and look'd at us all; upon which the Prisoner said, get out, you know I will not be in your Company, and gave him a slight shove, and push'd him against the Door. - not in such a Manner as to hurt him Gilchrist ask'd him, what he meant? and then the Prisoner gave him another shove; with that, Gilchrist struck him in the Face, and they clos'd together, and fell against the Table, the Table, they fell a-cross a Chair. prisoner bid him get up. for he would take age of him. Gilchrist accordingly got they had another Tustle, and fell on together: they got up again, and and I was not apprehensive that would ensue. They fell a third Time, and then the Deceased got the Prisoner's Finger in his Mouth, and made him cry out, and in endeavouring to disengage it, the Deceased bit his Thumb.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was there no Violence us'd?</p>
               <p>Bridges. No more than is generally us'd in fighting.</p>
               <p>Counc. When the Deceas'd was down, did not the Prisoner knee him or beat him?</p>
               <p>Bridges No, after it was over, he sat in a Chair, and hung down his Head; and then went to a Bench, and lay all along and groan'd. Several People there desir'd him to go Home, and at last Mr. Smith, and one of the Drawers carried him home.</p>
               <p>Counc. Before he was carried home, did he not complain of having receiv'd hurt?</p>
               <p>Bridges. He complain'd that he was not well, - to the nearest of my Thought. I can't say how long he liv'd after this, but I heard next Night that he was dead.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Do you think the Deceased's real Design was to get some Salt?</p>
               <p>Bridges. I believe it was to quarrel, for we enquir'd whether he had any Thing to eat with that Salt, and we found he had not. I heard that there had been Words between them, and that the Prisoner would not be in his Company if he could help it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Could Mr. Gilchrist see over the Sash-Door whether I was in the Kitchen?</p>
               <p>Bridges. Yes, he was tall enough. The Prisoner bears a very good Character, and is a peaceable, inoftensive Man: As to the other, I apprehended he was in Liquor at that Time.</p>
               <p>- Jones. I was Journeyman to the Deceased, and was at Home when he was brought in. He was set down in a Chair in the Shop, and he said, he had received his Death that Night, and cry'd out that he was murder'd, but did not say by whom. He seem'd very much disguis'd in Liquor when he was brought in.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was he not sober before he died?</p>
               <p>Jones. I can't tell that. He was brought in about a quarter past ten at Night, and died about twenty-four Hours afterwards.</p>

             I was a Lodger in the Deceased's House, and saw him when he was brought home The first Word he said when he came in was, that he had got his Death's Wound. He was very much in Liquor, and said sometime afterwards, that he receiv'd it from the Prisoner. I was frequently with him 'till he died, and he said it was a sad Thing for a Man to be murder'd<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280010"/> so.

               <p>Allen. He was in Liquor when I first saw him, but was very sober the following Day: He gave me this Account at Night, and repeated it again to me the next Day when he was sober.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Was Mrs. Bineham there at the same Time with you?</p>
               <p>Allen. I can't say; she was there several Times afterwards.</p>
               <p>Pris Q Will you take upon you to say that at eight, the Morning the Man was sober?</p>
               <p>Allen. Yes, I dare say he was.</p>
               <p>Mr. Small. Surgeon. I was call'd to attend the Deceased the 15th of February. He complained of extreme Pain in his Bowels, and seem'd then to be pretty much in Liquor. I did not know the Man, so that I could not be a Judge whether it was the Liquor, or the Agony of the Pain; for the Agony was so great, that when I went to open a Vein in his Arm, he could not bear to be stirr'd without complaining.</p>
               <p>I visited him next Morning, and he then appear'd to be in a dangerous Way. I informed another Surgeon of my Name, of the Condition I found him in: and desired him to go and see him; he accordingly did, and we declared him to be in imminent Danger. I saw him again in the Evening, after which I saw him no more 'till he was dead.</p>
               <p>C Was he sober when you saw him the next Day?</p>
               <p>Mr. Small. He gave distinct Answers both Morning and Evening to what Questions I put to him, and such as I think a sober Man would give; but I did not ask much about the Thing of him, because the By-standers are much sitter Persons to tell that.</p>
               <p>C. Did he give you no Account?</p>
               <p>Mr. Small. Yes, he said a Man with his Knee (I think he express'd it) stamp'd upon his Belly. I open'd his Body in the Presence of two or three Surgeons We found no external Bruises, but the Guts were broke in two different Places, which I apprehend proceeded from a violent Cause, either from a strong Pressure on his Belly, or a violent Blow. As the Man had been drinking, as I heard, for some Days before, the Gut might have been pretty much distended with Liquor, and any Thing of a Pressure or violent Push, might so far drive that Liquor from one Side to another, that where any Hindrance happened it might break the Guts through.</p>
               <p>C. Is it a usual Thing when the Intestines are not diseas'd, that they should burst without leaving an outward Mark ?</p>
               <p>Mr. Small. It is a very unusual Thing, and the Surgeons that were present, were of Opinion that such a Thing might not happen again in an Age There was no Sign of an Inflamation where they were broke, much less or Mortification, for they seem'd to be as good Order there, as in any other Part.</p>

             came in and sat down in one of the bo; this was between 3 and 4 o'Clock, and Mr. Gilchrist was then in the Kitchen. He went but in a short Time with Mr. Smith, and sat in the same Box where the Prisoner and Nind were drinking. They call'd for a Tankard of Beer, and I drew it; Smith paid for it, and went away; then Gilchrist began to quarrel with the Prisoner, and said, D - n you, you Dog, I will fight you now, or at any time; I will kill you. The Prisoner told him he would not have any Thing to say to him, and would not keep him Company. Gilchrist then took the Prisoner<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280011"/> by the Nose, and struck him in the Face, and Nind standing up, Gilchrist struck him two Smacks in the Face. The Prisoner then paid his Reckoning, and went away to Mr. Smith's, and about 6 o'Clock came in again, and sat down in the Kitchen. The Deceased was then asleep in a Box in the other Room, and was very much in Liquor. I did not see him go into the Kitchen, neither did I see any thing of the Quarrel, but I am certain he had no Occasion for Salt, for no Body in that Room had any thing to eat with it. As to Gilchrist's Character, he was when sober, very good-natur'd, but when he was in Liquor he would make a great Disturbance in the House.</p>
               <p>John Lambert I draw Beer at the Heath-cock, and remember the Afternoon that the Quarrel happen'd. The Prisoner and Mr. Nind were at out House together between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon. The Prisoner made an Officer to go into the Kitchen, but seeing the Deceased there, he drew back, and said, Gentlemen, I beg Pardon. They then went into the other Room, and call'd for Beer and Tobacco. When they had been there about half an Hour, the Deceased went out, but soon return'd with Mr. Smith; and went into the Box where the Prisoner and Nind were drinking. Smith said the Reckoning and went away, leaving Gilchrist behind. Then the Deceased began to quarrel, and call'd the Prisoner Scoundrel and Villain. The Prisoner desired him to be quiet, and got up to go on, upon which Nind desired, him to stay, and then the Deceased took him by the Nose, and gave him a slap in the Face. The Prisoner never offer'd to strike him or lift up his Hand; but immediately paid his Reckoning and went out.</p>
               <p>C. Before the Prisoner went away, did the Deceas'd use any particular Expressions?</p>
               <p>Lambert. Yes, he said he would fight him, the Prisoner in a merry way reply'd, What will you fight meant ? Why D - you ( said the Deceased ) at Sword and Pistol, and I will not leave you alive. Gilchrist was very drunk at that Time. Between 6 and 7 in the Evening, the Prisoner and Smith came in again together, and sat in the Kitchen. The Deceased was then asleep in one of the Boxes, and did not wake 'till between 9 and 10. Then he got up and rubb'd his Eyes, and look'd over the Sash-door of the Kitchen. Observing the Prisoner there, he went in towards the Chimney for some Salt, - Mr. Nind, nor any of the Company had nothing in the World to eat. I then went down for Beer, and when I came up again, I heard a rumbling and Noise in the Kitchen. I open'd the Door and saw the Deceased strike the Prisoner in the Face. Then they collar'd each other, and fell a-cross the Back of a Chair. The Prisoner got up, and told the Deceased he would not use him ill, and I believe no Hurt could happen, for the Prisoner got up that Minute from him.</p>

One end of th is Well-street, comes into Rosemary-Lane, the other into Rag-fair, and there the Prisoner and another Woman pick'd me up, and would have had me into a House with them, but I being unwilling, they push'd me in. It was between 9 and 10 at Night - I have belong'd to the Tower these 30 Years, and she used me very barbarcusly and threatened my Life, - there she is, and she has made her Brags that she robb'd me of every Thing, and has made me<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280013"/> me scandalous all over the Tower. I believe it was Mrs. Murray's House, but nobody lives in it now, for it is knock'd all to Pieces. When I came in Doors, there were three Men in the Room and two Women, they had got a Stinkabus of Gin, and I would have given them a Gold Ring to let me go, but that would not satisfie them, for they stripp'd me stark naked. The first Things they took were my Hat and Wig, which were better than those I have on now, and my Shoes I have now at Home, - I wish I had brought them with me. After they had taken my Cloaths, they all ran away, and I was forc'd to send for more, for I could not go home naked. They put me into a sad Fright, for they threaten'd my Life, and if I offer'd to stir or speak a Word, they would, &amp;c I was in so much Fear, that I cry'd and look'd out of the Window like a Madman; they stupified me, and burnt Liquor under my Nose; but I can't imagine how they got my Shirt off.</p>

She ask'd me some Questions, and then we agreed to go in and drink. She call'd for a Quartern of Gin, and after that, for a Pint of Hot, and then we went into another Room, where we stood pretty close together, and so she got the Money from me, and whipp'd out of the House. I immediately felt for my Purse, but it was gone, and I then cry'd Stop her! Stop her! but nobody did. I being a Countryman, did not know what to do, but this Gentleman, the Constable, went with me to the Justice, and got a Warrant, and came back to the House where I lost my Money. The Landlady pretended she did not know the Prisoner, and so we made further Enquiry after her, and found her about an Hour afterwards in the Vinegar Fields, and 25 s. 6 d. upon her. I am certain I had my Purse when I went into the Prisoner's Company, and as soon as she went out, I miss'd it.</p>
               <p>- Bunch. I was Officer in this Affair. The Prosecutor came to me, and said he had been robbed over the Way, upon which I went over with him, and accus'd the Woman of the House, and ask'd her, how she could give Liberty for such Doings; she said, she knew nothing of the Prisoner, but I threatning to take her before a Justice, she confess'd the Prisoner was her Sister. Then we got a Warrant, and took the Prisoner. I ask'd her how she could be guilty of so vile a Thing, and she said, she had but 9 s. of the Man's Money; and that was given her for Favours.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280014"/> However I brought her away, and upon searching her, I found 24 s. 6 d. in her Pocket, which she could give no Account of: - The Money was stuck together with Yolks of Eggs in her Pocket.</p>
               <p>- Davis. I have known the Prisoner these six Months, and better, and never have seen any Ill by her, but I have heard. - She has a very ill Character here, but I can give her none. <rs id="t17420428-16-verdict82" type="verdictDescription">

            . I being Plumber to the Parish of St. Sepulchre, was employed by Mr. Haines, the Church-Warden, to go and see what Lead was stolen, and what there was for me to do, and found it cut and mangled in several Places. On Shrove Sunday we went about in pursuit of this Lead, and to no Purpose; but on the Tuesday Night following, about ten o'Clock, we went to the House of one Mr. Ball, where we happen'd to find some of this Lead cut into two and forty Pieces, which I am very well satisfied was Part of the Lead that was taken from St. Sepulchre's Vestry Room, for I compar'd them together.</p>
               <p>Counc. How much is that Lead worth per Hundred?</p>

            . On the Saturday before Shrove-Tuesday, Fidlin, Stedman, and I, knock'd down four Cocks in the Fields, and had them dress'd at the Harrow, over-against St. Sepulchre's-Church. When we had paid some of our Reckoning, we came out, and got on the Top of the Vestry-Room belonging to the Church, and cut the Lead: When we had got enough, we carried it Home to our own Lodging in Three-Fox-Court, in Long-lane by Smithfield. On Sunday in the Afternoon, we went to Mr. Wilks's to drink, and while we were there, Mr. Boomer, and another Gentleman came to search the House. The next Morning we carried 109 Pounds of Lead to Wilks, - he keeps the George in Fleet-Lane, and I had been very well acquainted with the House before. When we came there with the Lead, we saw Wilks's Wife and Daughter, and after we had been down in the Cellar to weigh it, we drank a Pint of hot Ale and Gin, and I then desir'd Wilks to let us have the Money. He ask'd me what Money I meant? I told him I had brought in some Stuff, upon which he call'd his Daughter Bitch, for not letting him know what we had brought. I call'd him aside, and told him, we had five or six hundred Weight more, and desir'd him no have it, except he could sell it, for it might be of dangerous Consequence. He ask'd me, if we had cut it to Pieces? I told him we had not, upon which he bid us go home and do it, and he would send his Daughter with a Porter to fetch it away, and he accordingly did.</p>
               <p>Q. How much did you receive from Wilks for the first Parcel?</p>
               <p>Atkins. We received 1 s or 18 d. a piece then, and he us'd to give us 9 s. 4 d. a hundred: it was agreed between us some Months before, that that should be a common Price for our Lead.</p>
               <p>C. What Place did you tell Wilks to send for it?</p>
               <p>Atkins. We directed him to Three-Fox Court, and by his Order, his Daughter went home with us that she might find out the House again. Soon afterwards Wilks's Daughter came with a Porter, and carried the Lead away to Mr. Ball's a Plumber's; I know they went there with it, because<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280016"/> the Prisoner Stedman took a turn or two with them, and he told me, they had lodg'd it there, besides I myself had carried Lead there for Mr. Wilks, which we have stolen before this. I believe I could know the Lead again if I was to see it, but one Piece of Lead is like another; we know it to be so by our Experience in cutting it. I work as a Plaisterer myself, and have known Wilks ten Months; he keeps a Shop and buys Old Iron and Lead.</p>
               <p>Wilks's Q. Suppose you had gone to a Plumber, how much should you have got for the Lead?</p>
               <p>Atkins. Eleven Shillings a hundred or thereabouts : but any Thing of an honest Man would have examin'd us about it: I never sold any to any Signification but to Wilks, and I can't say he knew this to be stolen.</p>
               <p>Q. When you told him you had got more Lead at Home, what did he say to you?</p>
               <p>Atkins. He bid us go Home and cut it to pieces; I suppose for Fear it should be match'd; but he gave us no Reason for his chusing to have it cut.</p>
               <p>Pris. Stedman. Ask him whose House the Lead was carry'd to from the Vestry Room?</p>
               <p>Atkins. To my Father's in 3 Fox-court.</p>

He gave his Daughter Orders to go with me, and I went into 3 Fox-court and carry'd some Lead from thence up Mr. Ball's, the other Side of Leadenhall-market. I went 5 Times in all, two on the Monday, and three on Shrove Tuesday, and his Daughter went with me and saw the Lead weigh'd. I can't justly say what the weight of it was, whether it was 5 or 600 weight, but I remember there were 6 lb. allow'd for Dirt.</p>
               <p>C. When you were in 3 Fox-court, who gave you Directions to take the Lead away?</p>

             Wheeler in Tyburn-road. Mr. Wilks liv'd next Door to me for some Years: I have known him about 14 or 15 Years, but I have been little acquainted with him since he liv'd this way, though I have dealt with him for Tar and Grease. I always thought him an honest Man, and from the Knowledge I have of him, I don't belive he would buy stolen Goods.</p>

               <p>Falcon. No, it is backwards, but there are some Pales over the outer Door, about eight Feet high; they got over these, and so came into the Yard. I left the Kitchen Window safe when I went to Bed, (it was fasten'd with a Hasp such as usually are in Casements) but next Morning at 6 o'Clock, when I came down Stairs, I found it open. I had over Night providentially double lock'd my Kitchen Door, so that they could not get any farther; but the Shelves were clear'd of the Pewter, and upon examining a little Closet in the Kitchen, I miss'd the rest of the Goods mention'd in the Indictment. On the Sunday following, I received Information that the Evidence Veisey was taken, and by his Directions I found some of my Goods at the Places where he and his Companions had pawn'd them.</p>

            . The Night this Robbery was committed; the two Prisoners and I met together at Mr. Bagley's in Hartsborn-court; he sells Gin, and we always used to meet there. Newton propos'd going to this Man's (Falcon's) House, to take the Pewter, we staid at the Gin-shop 'till toward Eleven or Twelve o'Clock, and then went to this House. There is a Door in the Alley with some Pales over it like a Fence: I help'd Newton over, and then he unbolted the Door and let us into the Yard. Then Newton broke some of the Panes of Glass with his Hand; they were large Panes of Glass set in Lead. Cooley thought Newton did not do it fast enough, so he push'd him away, and broke some of the Glass himself, and turn'd the Bolt of the Window back. Newton went in first, and Cooley follow'd him, and handed out the Goods to me: there were a small Copper Pot, and Cover, a large brass Pot, 2 Dishes, a Sauce-pan, a Stew-pan, and some Plates: Cooley and I did not know the House 'till Newton shew'd it to us, we brought the Things from thence, and put them into an empty House 'till Morning, and then I pawn'd a Copper Pot and one Dish at Mr. Trofeir's somewhere by Clerkenwell, in Peter-street; and the Stew-pan I pawn'd at one Mrs. Davis's up an Alley in Golden-lane. Cooley and I afterwards went to steal some Rabbits, and I being taken for that made this Information.</p>

               <p>Veisey. We met together at Bagley's in Harisborn-court, where Newton ask'd us to go along with him, telling us he knew a House where we might get some Pewter. We went thither and I help'd Newton over the Fence, and he unbolted<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280018"/> the Door and let us in. Then he broke some Panes in the Casement, but Cooley thinking he did not break them fast enough, did the rest himself and so open'd the Window.

            , sen. The Evidence is my unfortunate Son. I was present when Newton was examin'd by the Justice, and the Evidence's Information was read over to him. When it was read that he got over the Prosecutor's Pales, open'd the Back door, and let in the other two, the Justice ask'd him whether it was not so? He said it was. Then it was read, - that Newton and Cooley broke the Window and open'd the Casement; and he said it was so. It was farther read that Newton and Cooley got in at the Window, and deliver'd out the Prosecutor's Goods to the Evidence, and being ask'd whether that was right? He said it was. He likewise confess'd that there was a great Brass Pot that held 3 or 4 Pails of Water, which he sold to one Cartet, for four Shillings, and he told us where Catrer liv'd, but I don't remember that. Cooley was not before the Justice at that Time so I did not hear his Confession.</p>

            , Constable. I was before Justice Poulson when Newton was there, and Veisey's Information was read over to him. I took them both, and they acknowledged every Thing according to the Information of the Accomplice.</p>
               <p>Q. When the Information was read over, were both the Prisoners present?</p>
               <p>Garnet. No, one of them was taken on Sunday Morning, and the other afterwards. Veisey's Father was before the Justice, when the Information was read to Newton, but I don't remember seeing him when Cooley was there.</p>
               <p>Q. What Distance of Time was there between Newton and Cooley's being before the Justice?</p>
               <p>Garnet. I think I took Newton out of Bridewell on Sunday Morning, and on the Thursday or Friday following Cooley was taken.</p>
               <p>[Part of the Goods were here produc'd, and sworn to by the Prosecutor.]</p>

The Prisoner hit me a Blow with his double Fist, right against my Heart, and knock'd out my Breath for sometime. Then the other Man knock'd me down with a short Staff, or Truncheon, and the Prisoner put his Hand into my Pocket, and took out what little Money I had, which amounted to 13 or 14 d. or something more. After this, they beat me most terribly as I lay down, - they did not tell me what was their Reason for it. When they had us'd me in this Manner, they made off, upon which I call'd Watch! and then they turned back, and knock'd me down again, and left me bleeding. They beat this Eye out, so that I shall never see out of it, and I spit Blood for two Days. I know very well that the Prisoner was one of them, because he stoop'd down towards me; besides it was a Moon-light Morning, and there are 4 or 5 large Lamps just by; there was nobody with me but my Boy.</p>

               <p>That is the Man who came up to my Father first, and the other Man who was along with him, knock'd my Father down: I remember it was the 14th of March, because my Father set it down, but I can't tell the Day of the Week. My Father and I went to see for some Money, and coming Home, the Prisoner made up to him just by the Half moon Tavern in Cheapside, and struck him on the Stomach, and the other knock'd him down with a short Staff. Then they stood over him, and threaten'd his Life, if he made a Noise, and he said they had taken 13 or 14 d. from him, I can't tell which.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they do any Thing to him while he was down?</p>
               <p>Bean. No, they did not strike him; they only stood swearing over him. My Father made shift to get up, and when he call'd the Watch, they came back, and knock'd him down again, and then made off.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know that the Prisoner was one of the Men that robb'd your Father?</p>
               <p>Bean. Because I have seen him three Times; twice when he knock'd my Father down, and once since that, by Honey lane Market.</p>
               <p>Pris. I was standing at St. Andrew's Church, and Attley the Thief-catcher gave a young Man a Half-penny to get some Tobacco, and I ask'd him for a Bit of it. Then I went to Field lane, to get a Sheep's-Head for my Supper, and he came there after me, and took me.</p>

Carter hearing of Thompson's Decease, applyed to Doctor's Commons to prove the Will that was left with him: that upon his coming there, he found that another Will had been proved, which was the Will in Question, and wherein Thompson was said to have appointed the Prisoner his Legatee, who must (in order to have been entitled to receive a Probate) have taken an Oath that that was the true Will of

That, as soon as Carter found this Fraud had been committed, he made what search he could to find out this Rhodes, and at last received Information of him at Mitchell's Coffee-House near the Navy-Office, and he was afterwards taken up for this Fact. It was farther observed, that it was a great Misfortune attending this Sort of Men, that they are not only subject to greater Casualties than other People, but also leave their Effects under great Uncertainty; that upon the Probate of a Will's being produc'd, the proper Officer of the Navy is bound to deliver a Ticket for the Wages of the Sailor to that Person who appears to be entitled to it, and that it has been too much a Practice lately for Persons to set up Wills which never were real, to get into their Custody, that Pay which these honest Men have earn'd with the Sacrifice of their Lives, &amp;c.</p>

            , an able Seaman, died the 22d of August, 1739, at Turtle Bay, on board the Flamborough, and the Ticket was made out for his Wages, and sent to the Navy-Office.</p>
               <p>Jury. When was the Ticket made out?</p>
               <p>Mr. Roseindale. I presume, presently after the Man died.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280023"/>It was here urg'd by the Council for the Prisoner, that this was improper Evidence to be laid before the Jury, and not sufficient to prove Thompson's Death; that a Fact of this Kind should be prov'd by Persons who were on board the Ship, for that the Captain or other Officers of the Ship might through Mistake or Design, return the Man dead when he was really alive.</p>
               <p>In answer to which, the Councel for the Prosecution said they were surpriz'd to hear this Objection made; for that according to the known Course of the Navy, the Names of all the Sailors that die, are regularly enter'd in a Book for that Purpose; that this Book was given in Evidence in December last in the Case of Fitzgerald and Lee; the Evidence of Perry's Death being only a Book of this Kind. That the Person who dies is always enter'd in this Book, and when it comes over here, the Consequence of that is, there is a Ticket made out for the Wages, and according to the known Course of the Navy, deliver'd to the Person who brings the Probate: That as the Prisoner stood indicted for publishing a Will, it was an Acknowledgment by himself that the Party was dead, unless he could go and swear he was dead, and prove his Will, when he is alive: That the Prisoner had actually receiv'd the Pay of that Man, and therefore he thought him dead or certainly he would not have gone to Doctor's-Commons to prove the Will; that if this was not Evidence to prove his Death, no Seaman could be secure of one Shilling which he was venturing his Life for every Hour he lives, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By the Prisoner's Councel in Reply it was offer'd that there were a great many People on board the Ship who best knew whether the Man was alive or no, and that the Proof ought to be fuller in this than in other Cases; that notwithstanding the Prisoner might have prov'd this Will, that was not sufficient; for that a great many People had prov'd Wills, when it has appear'd that the Person was alive.</p>
               <p>It was farther observed by the Councel on the same side that there was no such Thing as a Will while a Man was alive, for that he might controul it every Moment: That no Person appear'd here, upon the true Survey of the Ship to prove this Man dead, and therefore 'twas hop'd that what had been offer'd against the Prisoner, was not sufficient Evidence of the Death of a Man in a Case of Felony.</p>
               <p>Upon the Whole, the Court were of Opinion that the Councel for the Prosecution should go on with their Evidence.</p>

               <p>Pris. Q. What Day did you sign the Will for Carter?</p>
               <p>Boyden. It is impossible for me to remember that; I know the Time; but I can't remember the Day or the Year.</p>

             in his Life Time. I can't say I ever saw his Writing before he sign'd a Will to which I was a Witness; - the Will that he made to Carter.</p>
               <p>Counc. What Time was that?</p>
               <p>Gibson. I believe in 37 or thereabouts; it was a little after the Queen's Mourning; - he was a Servant to me then as a Taylor.</p>
               <p>Counc. Was he a Seaman at that Time?</p>
               <p>Gibson. No, nor never had been a Seaman before.</p>
               <p>Counc. Look at that Hand-writing there.</p>
               <p>Gibson. It is nothing like his Hand. I saw both the Wills before Mr. Deveil, and that which I witness'd I can swear was his Hand-writing, but this is not.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q Did you ever see him write since that?</p>
               <p>Gibson. Yes, once at my own House; it was his Name to a Note of Hand: This Will is dated March 7, 1737. this is my Hand, and I saw Thompson write that at the Time it bears Date.</p>
               <p>Pris. How long after that Will was made did you see him write his Name to the Note.</p>
               <p>Gibson. The same Day.</p>
               <p>Boyden. This Will is Mr. Thompson's Hand; I sat by him when he wrote it, and look'd particularly at it; I am a subscribing Witness to it, and it is not like the pretended Will at all.</p>
               <p>Mr. Carter being call'd by the Councel for the Prosecution, it was urg'd on Behalf of the Prisoner that he was a Person interested, and therefore could not be admitted to give Evidence; that this was the same as a Case of a Note of Hand, where the Party who is bound by that Note comes to prove it forg'd, to secure his own Interest.</p>
               <p>In answer to which, it was said, that the Consequence of this Suit could in no shape affect Carter, the other Will being already prov'd in the proper Court, and supposing the Will which the Prisoner stood indicted for should really prove a good one, yet Carter's Will being subsequent would destroy it. The Prisoner's Will bearing Date in the Year 36, and Carter's 37, making it indisputable: That this was not a private Prosecution, but a Prosecution in the Name of the Crown for the Benefit of the Public, that the Prisoner might be punish'd according to Law, therefore exactly agreeable to a common Case of Felony.</p>
               <p>It was observed by the Prisoner's Councel in Reply that this was no Answer to the Objection; that Carter (who had a Will) was called to prove which was the real one, the 1st, or the last; that he was call'd to prove the Prisoner's Will false, and certainly he must have Benefit by that, for that then his own would stand without doubt. The Court being of Opinion that Carter was not a competent Witness, the Councel proceeded to call

               <p>Counc. What did he say upon this Occasion?</p>
               <p>Russel. He shew'd me the Ticket, and ask'd me to buy it: I said I would if it was a good one: I sent over to the Office and had it cast with the Books, and paid him the Money for it.</p>
               <p>Counc Did you ever see him with Carter?</p>
               <p>Russel. Yes, I believe I have: I heard him say to Carter, if he could prove his Will to be good, he would make any just Agreement with him, for they both said that Thompson ow'd them Money.</p>

He never was a Seaman before that, by what I have heard him say, and he work'd with me within a Day or two before he went to Sea. He has apply'd to several People who had been at Sea to inform him about the Business, for he was going Taylor to Captain Pierce of the Flamborough. He din'd with me almost every Day in the Week, and frequently supp'd with me except his Business call'd him another Way.</p>

               <p>A Witness. This Will was brought to me by Rhodes. He likewise brought another Will of Thompson's which I have in my Pocket; I think it is made to

            . Thompson's Will being prov'd, a Citation was taken out against Rhodes to bring it in, and shew Cause why a Will of a later Date should not be prov'd. Sometime after that, the Prisoner said he had found out a Will of a later Date than the other. I look'd upon it, and told him, he must bring his Witnesses if he intended to support it. He said, he knew but little of that Affair; but that one Mrs. Glass could inform me farther of it. He left me the Will and the Letter in which it was inclos'd, and I went to Mrs. Glass, who told me, she had received that Will enclos'd in the Letter from Mrs. Vaughan at Portsmouth, and desir'd every Thing might be done that was necessary to support it; but Rhodes's Wil l never was prov'd by Testes, therefore it was revok'd, and the other granted.</p>

He has gone in my Parish under the Character of an honest Man, and it is more than I know if he would do such a Thing as this. I use the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280027"/> Holland Trade, and have sold him Stockings and Linnen, and have trusted him for a Month together. He is a Cheesemonger, and lives at t'other End of the Town. I have liv'd in St. Katherine's Parish these 9 Years, and he us'd to call upon me at my Chandler's Shop, and paid for what he wanted.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner about ten or a dozen Years. He liv'd in Little St. Andrew-street, near the Seven-Dials, and from thence he mov'd to the Corner of Earl-Street, in King-street. When he liv'd in St. Andrew-Street, he behav'd very well, and was respected by the Neighbourhood, and was a very industrious Man; but when he mov'd into Earl-street, he became a Headborough, which a great many People believe was of no Service to him, for he has been accus'd of a great many foolish Things not to his Credit, with regard to Thief-taking, which is not a creditable Thing for a House-keeper. By following these Practices, his Business was reduc'd to such a low Ebb, that at last I believe he was driven to his Shifts; and there was something stuck up against one of his Window-Shutters, but what it was I can't tell. His Character is really a very bad one.</p>

The Prisoner came by with a great Stick in his Hand like a Broom-stick, and a Knife or Dagger in the other. The Press-Gang pushed him down in the Middle of the Highway, and left him: Then he got up again, and stood talking to the black Man: I heard the Black say something to him that the Woman ought to be hang'd for picking the Gentleman's Pocket, and the Prisoner immediately gave him a Punch with something that he had in his Hand; I can't tell whether it was a Knife or a Dagger, but I am sure the Black did nothing at all to him. The Prisoner struck him in the Face, and then gave him another Knock with the same Instrument, and the Black fell down in the Highway directly, and never spoke afterwards. Then the Prisoner ran away into the Ship Alehouse, and was lost for half an Hour before we could hear any Thing of him; but we went into a Gentleman's Yard, and saw him getting over the Pales: He hid himself under a Bench in an Arbour, and we pulled him out from thence, and told him he had killed the Black: He said, he hop'd he had not, and then we took him to the Watch-House.</p>

Coming through Shorter-Street again, I saw the Black go through the Square with the Press-Gang, and he stood by while they put the Woman into the Watch-House: The Prisoner was there at the same Time, and the Black said something that the Woman deserved to be hang'd, or some such Thing: Upon which the Prisoner gave him a Push with something that look'd like one of your snick or snee Knives: He gave him another Push, and he fell on his Back, and never spoke afterwards: The first Blow was on the right Eye, and the second on the right Shoulder.

               <p>Gould Cole, Surgeon. I searched this Negroe's Wounds two Days after he died; one was a small incis'd Wound on the Top of the deltui'd Muscle, about half an Inch long, and an Inch deep; there was another small Wound on the Frontis, which is the Forehead; and another, which was a perquilated Wound, above the right Eye, (into the Socket which contains the Eye) about four Inches and an half deep, and an Inch long: The Wound in his Eye was certainly the Cause of his Death, for that in his Shoulder was of no Signification.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any Parts of his Face scratched?</p>
               <p>Cole. I did not observe any: This Wound in the Eye I take it, was given by some sharp Instrument, like a Sword or Dagger; and that on the Forehead, was a little small Wound like a Scratch.</p>
               <p>DEFENCE.</p>
               <p>Jane Wall. Another Woman and I went into Mr. Allen's to call for a Pint of Two penny: The Black came in after us, and said, he had been there some Time of the Day, and spent three half Crowns in Punch, and had lost some Money in the House by some of the Women: He made a Noise in the House, and said he would not go till he had got his Money. There was a Lad along with him, who said he had lost a Shilling; and the Gentleman of the House turned them, and some of the Women out of Doors. In a little Time the Black came back again, all over Blood: - This was about 7 o'Clock at Night.</p>
               <p>Hopkins. The Fact was done about half an Hour after 9, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Wall. He came in, and stood against the Partition; and the Blood run down to his Temple.</p>
               <p>Jury. Did you look in his Face then?</p>
               <p>Wall. Yes, and the Blood run down all over his Shirt.</p>
               <p>Jury to the Surgeon. Did the Wound in the Eye disfigure the Negro's Face?</p>
               <p>Cole. It went quite through the Eye-Lash; but that in the Forehead might bleed a little.</p>
               <p>Wall. The Blood that I saw, proceeded from this Place. [Pointing to her Forehead.] I desired him to go Home, for fear of being used ill; and he said he would lose more Blood, before he would go Home without his Money.</p>

            . This Woman and I were in the Alehouse when the Black came in: He said he had been ill used, and robbed in the House, and he would have his Money. There were two Women, one black and the other white: And the People of the House bid him get out, but he refused; and so they shut him and the Women out in the Entry: They all came in again in a few Minutes, and then I saw the Blood run down his Shirt on the right Side: This was about Seven o'Clock at Night, and next Morning I heard he was murdered.</p>

               <p>C. Now tell us all the Circumstances of the Case in the Manner they happened.</p>
               <p>Portman. I am Constable, and was coming from the Watch-House to go my Rounds into Turnbull-street, and I told Crawley who was with me, that I would first step again to the Watch House: There came four Horses and passed me; the fifth was about ten or a dozen Yards behind the other, and I had not above two Steps to go, before I could have got quite 'cross the Way. The fifth Horse met me, and rode up against me, and I held up my Staff just so, which made him start, and the Man on his Back struck at me: Upon that I struck the Horse on the Head, thinking I had as much Authority in the Night as he; and then he fired a Pistol. A second Man then came up, and I hit the Horse a good Knock, which made him turn round with his Tail to me. The second Man (whom I apprehend to be one of the four that passed by me) fired a Pistol directly at me. I plaid about with my Constable's Staff, which is about 8 Feet long, hitting first one Horse, and then the other: They fired seven more at me, and I had no other Chance to save my Life, but by keeping the Horses in an unsettled Motion. An eighth Pistol was fired, and I never heard Crawley say any Thing till the Men were gone off, and then he said, Master, I am wounded! I am shot! There were five Horses in all, four passed me, and the other had not, and there were two Men that fir'd at me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the People belonging to the other four Horses go off?</p>
               <p>Portman. I saw none but the two Men that came up to me afterwards; the rest of the Company were gone before. I apprehend that the last Pistol shot Crawley, for I did not hear him say any Thing 'till they were gone off, though he was within 7 or 8 Yards of me.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had the Men been gone off, before Crawley said he was shot?</p>
               <p>Portman. They had not got two Yards before he spoke: Master, (said he) I am a dead Man! I am shot in the Arm! and if he ever saw the Face again he could know him. - I hope I never can err, but what I say is Truth, therefore I do tell you, we got Crawley to the Watch-House, by the Assistance of a Man who rose in his Shirt, and a Watchman: One took hold of his Arm, and the other his Legs, and I carried the two Lanthorns. Then I went to call Mr. Woodburne, a Surgeon, who does the Parish Business: He would not get up, but however at last he sent his Man, and upon pulling off Crawley's Cloaths, he said there were five Ballets or Slugs in the Man's Arm; it was in this Part of the Arm, a little below the Elbow.</p>
               <p>Q. What Distance might these Wounds be from each other?</p>
               <p>Portman. About an Inch Distance; there were three on a Row, and two length Ways; but in my Surprize, I can't give the Particulars of that; but if I may speak my Heart, I believe it could be by one Discharge only. Mr. Woodburne's Man telling me he could do nothing for him, I called a Chair, and carried him to the Hospital, where he died that Day Week, as they told me, much about the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280031"/> Time that he was shot. Now I come to the Prisoner: After I had given my Information before Justice Poulson, Mr. Foster came to the Justice's for the Tea, and I told him the same as I have said now; this was on the Monday Morning. When we had been there some Time, Mr. Foster said he was dry, and so after we had been to a Butcher's, and weigh'd the Tea, we went to the Hole in the Wa ll, I think it was, where we sat down in the back Room, and had a Tankard of Beer. When we had drank best Part of a 2d Pot, Mr. Foster said to one Mr. Quaife, who was in our Company, I am very uneasy about your Friend John! Why don't you fetch your Friend John? Mr. Quaife then went out, and I told Mr. Foster, these Men were cowardly Fellows, for five of them need not have trifled with me with Fire-Arms: However presently in comes Mr. Bolton, or Bolter, the Prisoner; - he had Boots on then, and he had not come within a Yard of me, before I said to Mr. Foster, I have made the Face! That is the Man! I sat between Mr. Foster and another Man; one bobb'd me on one Knee, and the other on the other: - The Truth will never err: - All the Council in England can't baffle me: - Here are two Lives lost. Then the Prisoner got behind me, and laid up against the Dresser, and I challenged him again: Gentlemen, (said I) I will assure you this is the very Man! That is the very Mark ! Mr. Foster bobb'd me on one Side, and the other Man on the other, a second Time; and on my repeating my Assurances a third Time, they bobb'd me again in the same Manner. Observing no Body take Notice of what I said, I told them I must go Home, for I was not safe in their Company: Mr. Foster said I was very safe, for Bolton was a Custom-House Officer: With that, my Spirits were quite flagg'd and daunted; and so I took up my Pipe, and would stay t'other Tankard. I jostled my Chair about, and fac'd the Prisoner: Heark ye, my Friend, (said I) what Countryman are you? Where dost live? The Prisoner spoke not a Word, good, bad, or indifferent; with that Mr. Foster said, you Blockhead, why don't you come into Company? Then the Prisoner sat down, and he made the sixth Man in the Company; and I told them again, I was sure he was the Man. Then the Argument ceased, and Mr. Poulson's Clerk came in: It seems he was to do something for Mr. Foster about a Cart Load of Tea that had been seized, and he desir'd it might be let alone till Morning, for he could not do it that Night</p>
               <p>C. I thought it was Morning when you was at the Hole in the Wall?</p>
               <p>Portman. No; it was between ten and eleven at Night; I never said it was Morning: However we staid till the Paper was done, and Mr. Scavendish (Mr. Poulson's Clerk) being going to his Father's, I was glad of the Opportunity, and said I would go with him. Before I got out of the House, I told him that I believed the Prisoner to be one of the Men that shot at me and

            . I went Home to Bed, but could not sleep, so I got up next Morning, and went to Mr. Poulson's; this was Tuesday Morning: I told him the same as I have said now; and Mr. Poulson wrote to Mr. Foster to bring the Man, and I waited all Day, but he did not come. The next Day, which was Wednesday, Mr. Foster was ordered by the Commissioners to bring Bolton to me; and they accordingly came on the Friday following, and four or five more with them. Mr. Foster desired I might look over these Men, for perhaps I might know some of them, and the right Man he said was just by, and he would send for him. I looked at them, and thought it not usual to be trifled with, and I looked on the Ground for some Time: Then I got up, and spoke to the Prisoner. Says Mr. Foster hastily, Which is the Man among all these? So I went up to Bolton, put my Hat between his Legs, and said, That is the Man. He was then committed upon my believing him to be the Man, as I do still.</p>
               <p>Q. You say it was between Two and Three of the Clock: What Sort of a Morning was it?</p>
               <p>Portman. It was Moon-light, and there were two Pistols discharged; one behind, and another before me; besides the Watchmen had their Lanthorns.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you take the Prisoner to be the first or the second Man that attacked you?</p>
               <p>Portman. That is the biggest Thing that has puzzled me; for the Horses turned about so, that I can't say as to that; but he had on a light Duffill Coat, and a Great Coat over it.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect the Man by his Habit, his Stature, or his Face?</p>
               <p>Portman. By the Face, and nothing else: I never saw him with my Eyes before that Night. One of the Men had a hoarse, coarse Voice; and the other a smooth Voice.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Prisoner speak when he came into the Hole in the Wall?</p>
               <p>Portman. No, not a Word: I have heard him speak since, but I can't recollect him by his Voice.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280032"/>Q. Had the Person who attacked you a Hat on?</p>
               <p>Portman. Yes, they had both Hats on; but to be sure I must be in a good deal of Confusion, for one of the Pistols took a Button-hole off here, and another shot through my Great Coat. The Terror of the Prisoner's Face being then upon me, occasioned me to speak when he came into the Company. I have one Thing more to say: - They brought one

               <p>Pris. Q. Did you give any particular Description that Night of the Persons supposed to commit this Fact, whereby there was an Advertisement put into the Papers?</p>
               <p>Portman. You must first and foremost set me out in the Light that I am, for I can neither write or read: I did give a Description to Mr. Poulson.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Do you know your own Mark if you see it?</p>
               <p>Portman. Yes, it is a Figure of Two: - I can't say whether this is my Mark, because I seldom turn the Tail so high; but I did set my Mark to a Writing at Mr. Poulson's, but I don't know that Writing if I were to see it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Do you believe that to be your Mark or not?</p>

               <p>Pris. Q. Do you think that Paper was sign'd by you or not?</p>
               <p>Portman. If I was to speak as I think, I did not; if I did, it must be my Trembling or Surprize.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Was the Paper which you signed read over to you?</p>
               <p>Portman. Yes; I believe that was the first that was made, and was thrown away, and I never sign'd any afterwards.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Did the Paper which you signed contain a Description of the Person supposed to shoot Crawley?</p>
               <p>Portman. Yes; the first that Mr. Poulson wrote did, and I signed it.</p>
               <p>Pris. Q. Did not you give that Description on Monday Night?</p>

            : We were ordered by Mr. Foster to go to the End of Long-Lane, for there were five Horses with Tea come in that Morning, and we were to see if they moved them. We went there first, and were suspicious of two Houses in Three-Fox-Court, upon which we got a Constable and rummaged those Houses, but we did not find the Goods. After we had parted with the Constable, we went to the Place to wait, and between nine and ten o'Clock a Boy came by with an half hundred Bag: We followed him, and in St. John's-street we asked him if he had got a Permit: He would not tell us, so we follow'd him as far as Chancery-Lane, and then he shewed us the Permit. We then went back to Long-Lane, and waited till eleven o'Clock: And in the Road, going Home, just before we came to Moorfields, there were some People up in a House, and we went in to drink. Davage went away before one o'Clock; Quaife and I staid and drank till near three o'Clock, and then we went Home together into Tower-Street.</p>

About the 3d of April I received Information, that five Horses of run Tea had been unloaded at One in the Morning, at the End of Long-Lane, next Smithfield; but the Person that saw them unload, did not know into what House the Goods were put. About 6 in the Evening I sent for the Prisoner and

            , who is likewise an Officer of the Customs, and directed them to go into Long-Lane, and to search a House or two; but if they did not find the Goods there, I ordered them to wait, as privately as they could, 'till Ten or Eleven o'Clock; for my Information was, that before the Watch came about, the Goods would be moved. As to what Portman has been pleased to say, - I was before Mr. Poulson when this Examination was taken, and I saw him sign it. Mr. Poulson directed me to come for the Tea, and there were twenty-five Pounds delivered to me, and I was willing to hear what Account Portman gave of these Smugglers, believing we might find something of Service to the Revenue. Accordingly when he had given this Information, we went to the Hole in the Wall, that we might talk more freely. I took Quaife and Davage with me. Bolton happened not to be at this House so soon as I expected, so I sent Quaife for him, that he might hear what the Constable said. Quaife brought him in, and he sat down in a Chair near a quarter of an Hour The Prosecutor (Portman) did say something that he had made the Face, upon which I bid Bolton come round that Portman might have a fair Light Accordingly he came towards the Dresser, where he staid all the Time that the Constable was there. On the Friday following, by the Conmissioner's Directions I went with the Prisoner before Mr. Poulson, and I thought it would be Justice to take one or two Men with me, who went with Bolton upon the Information, and who would know it he was absent from them; but Portman did not pitch upon any of them but the Prisoner. As to Bolton, I have sent him upon different Occasions, where his Life has been in great Danger, and he always behav'd as a faithful Servant ought to do. I heard Portman give the Description of the Man that did this Fact, and it does not answer the Prisoner, neither in the Features, Age, nor having the Small Pox. I never saw Bolton wear a black Wig, but when he is about his common Business, he has such a Wig as Countrymen usually wear. Portman has likewise said, that Mr. Poulson wrote to me on the Tuesday to bring the Prisoner: the Reason why I did not, was because I had sent him with a Summons to a Man in the Country, to shew Cause why his Cart should not be forfeited, for having in it about eleven hundred Weight of Tea. And at the Hole in the Wall, I don't know but I might touch him with my Knee, and I desir'd him not to talk in that Manner in a public Ale-House, for the Man was a Custom-House Officer.</p>

He ordered us to go and search some Houses in Three-Fox-Court, and if we did not find the Tea, we were to stay in Smithfield 'till eleven o'Clock or thereabouts.

We all agreed after this to go and drink, and we accordingly went to a Public House in Charter-house-lane, and had some Beer, and I believe it was near 9 o'Clock before we parted with the Constable.

I ask'd him, if he had any Permit; he said, if I wanted to know, I should go with him into Long-Acre. I was not willing to give the Boy any Suspicion, so I said to Bolton, John, you know that is our Way home, we will go with him: He led us into Chancery lane, and when we came near the Golden Iyon, he said he would not make us go any farther, and so he shewed us the Permit. We then returned to Smithfield, as fast as we could; it might then be better than a Quarter after ten. We had given Davage Directions to wait there till we came back, and there we found him. We staid there till near half an Hour after eleven to no Purpose, and then we agreed to return home: Davage liv'd in Spittle Fields, and so we agreed to go over Moorfields. When we came into Chiswel-street, we agreed to drink at the first House that should be open. Davage and the Prisoner ask'd me where I would go? I told them, if

Accordingly we went in, and call'd for a Pot of Beer, and staid there all three in Company 'till better than half an Hour after 12 o'Clock. A Person then came in, who said she had been 'frighted by Thieves in the Fields, and we were detain'd in Talk 'till very near three o'Clock; - Davage left us before one. About two o'Clock a poor Woman came in, who carried a Basket in the Market, and I began to talk with her. Bolton pretended to her, that he was my Servant, and I made her believe that I was in Love with her. Bolton and I staid there till near three o'Clock, and going over Moorfields, the Watch went three, and we made all the Haste we could Home, thinking our Wives would be 'frighted. We went together to the End of Beer-Lane, in Tower street, near the Custom-house, and Bolton parted from me there. He lives in Crown-court, Seething-lane, and I had but just got up Stairs, when he came back and knock'd at my Door, and ask'd for his Wife.

               <p>Quaife. I was at Mr. Poulson's when Bolton was examin'd: Portman, Davage and I, were in Mr. Poulson's Room, where he examines the Witnesses. I ask'd Portman how he ever could make this poor Man Satisfaction? Why, (said he) what you mean by that? You are endeavouring (answer'd I) to swear his Life away when he is an innocent Man: His Answer to that was, if Mr. Foster had told him Bolton was an Officer, and had not jok'd with him at the Hole in the Wall, he would not have carried it on so far; but since he had begun, he was resolv'd to go through with it, let the End be what it would. Hearing him say this, I inform'd Mr. Poulson of it directly.</p>

When the Thing came so hard, it shock'd me, and Mr. Quaife very much, and we went into the Office: Portman follow'd us, and I ask'd him how he could be guilty of such a villainous Thing as to charge Bolton? I don't know, (said he, and walk'd about) It is Mr. Foster's Fault. for if he had been so good to have told me that the Man was an Officer, and had given me civil Language, I had not carried the Thing so far, but as it is, I must go through with it. Quaife and I upon hearing this, went directly and told it to Mr. Poulson, and Mr. Paul, and Mr. Poulson sent for Portman in, and asked him the Question, and he denied that he ever said any such Thing. When Bolton was order'd from New-Prison to Newgate, I went to Hicks's-Hall, where I happen'd to see Portman. He seemed to be shy of speaking to me, but I shook Hands with him, and ask'd him what he design'd to do. He complain'd of his Attendance on Mr. Foster and the Commissioners, and he said, he pitted the poor Fellow in Prison, for now instead of one Indictment, he might now have four or five against him.</p>

They did not all go away together, for Davage went out about One; he saw they were for drinking, and therefore he would go, but Quaife and Bolton did not go 'till near three o'Clock.</p>

            . I have known the Prisoner these 8 Years. On Saturday Night, the 3d of April, between 11 and 12, nearer 12 I believe it was, he came into my House with Mr. Quaife: There was a third Person whom I take to be Davage, but I did not know him so well as the others. He (Davage) went away at one, but Bolton and Quaife staid 'till 3, and then went away together. I know it was 3 o'Clock, because the Watchman came about, and he is pretty particular.</p>

               <p>Cardel. Yes, he was what we call a French-Plate-Worker, and I know of above an hundred Pounds worth of his Goods, which I myself have taken in, and enter'd into Mr. Green's Book.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Was there no Payment made by Green?</p>
               <p>Cardel. Not one single Payment of 20 s. to my Knowledge. Here is the Book where I set it down. I was Green's Servant, and he often sent me to Brifant's House to look out Goods for Sale.</p>
               <p>Here the Commission of Bankrupt was read.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Why you talk of a little Brass ting'd over with a Silver Colour! an hundred Pounds is a great deal of Money!</p>
               <p>Cardel. I understand the Business a little better than you: there were Goods to that Value according to the Market Price.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Will you venture to say there were 5 l. worth of Silver on all that you took in?</p>
               <p>Cardel. That is not material, if it was the Market Price. I took Care not to pay more than the common Price, because I understood them better than Mr. Green.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. I don't impeach your Understanding: was there the whole Value of fourscore Pounds brought into your Shop?</p>
               <p>Cardel. I dare say there were upwards of 100 l in Brass, Silver and Workmanship.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280036"/>Counc. Def. How long did you leave Green before he fail'd?</p>
               <p>Cardel. I believe 3 or 4 Months.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. So then you can't say there were 100 l. due when Green fail'd?</p>
               <p>Cardel. No, but when I left him there was so much due.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you left the Defendant, were the last Goods sent in on Brifant's Account?</p>
               <p>Cardel. That I can't say, for we had Trifles often coming in: we receiv'd a great Quantity that were pack'd up as if they were going abroad. I receiv'd with my own Hands to the Value of 113 l. and to my Knowledge none of them were paid for.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Did you never hear Brifant say he had received Money?</p>
               <p>Cardel. No, I never did.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you ever deny Green to any Body?</p>
               <p>Cardel. Yes, to Mr. Rudge's Clerk: He desired me not to let him be troubled with such People, in April 1740.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did you know that these People were Creditors?</p>
               <p>Cardel. Yes, Rudges Clerk asked me for Money: we took our Beer of Mr. Rudge. I have likewise denied him to Mr. Hopkins a Glazier.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was Green when you denied him to Mr. Rudge's Clerk?</p>
               <p>Cardel. Sometimes he has been out, but I have denied him when he has been above Stairs in the House.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Had not your Master a Lodging at Hackney?</p>
               <p>Cardel. Yes, but Mr. Rudge served us with Beer in Town: I can't tell whether he did the same in the Country.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Then you don't know but that Mr. Rudge and your Master might have settled Accounts?</p>
               <p>Cardel. I don't know that they did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Hopkins the Glazier do any Business for your Master?</p>
               <p>Cardel. I can't say that; I have heard that he glaz'd the House.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coningsby. I was one of the Commissioners named in this Commission, and it was on the 15th of Nov. 1740. Mr. Malmot, Mr. Salkeld, and my self took the Oath as the Act directs. The Purport of it was, ''

Mr. Malmot, Mr. Salkeld, Mr. Whitorne, and myself were Commissioners, and this is the original Declaration made by us as Commissioners.</p>
               <p>Here the Declaration was read, together with the Notice in the Gazette, for Prior Green to surrender himself for Examination, the 24th of Nov. and the 1st and 30th of Dec.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coningsby. The Defendant did surrender himself on the 24th of Nov. but for the Particulars of the Examination, I must refer myself to the Proceedings which I have sign'd.</p>
               <p>They were read, and it appear'd by them that the Defendant did surrender himself to Mr. Coninsby, Mr. Melmot, Mr. Conway, and Mr. Whitorne, and that being on Oath, he said he was not prepar'd to make a Discovery of his Effects, therefore desired farther Time, which accordingly was granted.</p>
               <p>Counc. Did Mr. Whitorne qualifie himself when he fate?</p>
               <p>Mr. Coningsby. I must beg Leave to refresh my Memory; if you will cast your Eye upon that Place, you will find he was sworn.</p>
               <p>Counc. Now as to the Defendants signing his Surrender; - is that his Hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Mr. Coningsby. I believe it to be so by my signing it, and I am very sure it was read to him, for I never allow these Things to be sign'd till they are read carefully over.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Is it not common to take these Things away from the Table, and not sign them before you?</p>
               <p>Mr. Coningsby. No, they are always sign'd before me. The next meeting we had was on the 15th of December, at the Crown-Tavern, but I beg to be guided by the Proceedings all along, though I very well remember I was there.

             his Book-keeper, at his Shop in Moorfields, 20 l. which he represented to us a fair Debt, whereas no such Money was due.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goulder. I was Clerk to this Commission. and when the Defendant appear'd on the 15th of<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="174204280037"/> December, 1740, I was present all the Time: Three was an Enquiry made with regard to 20 l. that he had paid to one Warden, and which Warden returned him again: He said it was all due to Warden for Wages and Board: He was contradicted in that by a Receipt in full but the Midsummer before, for Wages and Board He was then asked, if Warden did not return him that 20 l again, and he said he did not. This was at the Crown Tavern, and I believe he was an Hour on his Examination. There is another Examination of the 17th of February, and for Particulars, I must refer to that.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Did not you fetch the Defendant from an Alehouse the 15th of December, for Examination?</p>
               <p>Mr. Goulder. No, I never was at an Alehouse with him in my Life: He might be fetched from thence for ought I know.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Was he not disguised in Liquor?</p>
               <p>Mr. Goulder. He might for ought I know, for he behaved very badly, and I believe he had been drinking pretty freely; but he was pretty sober when he attended the Commissioners afterwards, and then he accounted for the 20 lbs.</p>
               <p>Counc. Def. Was he ever offered his Certificate?</p>
               <p>Mr. Goulder. I can't tell.</p>
               <p>Council to Mr. Coningsby. Do you think that the Defendant was on the 15th of December so disguised as not to be examined?</p>
               <p>Mr. Coningsby. To be sure if I had thought him so, I would not have examin'd him; but what with Passion or Liquor, he seemed always to be outragious: I never saw him otherwise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Goulder. I believe he generally was in Liquor, except the last Day, which was the Time that he explained himself; then he was tolerably sober.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor's Order, for enlarging the Time for the Defendant, was read, being first proved by Mr. Goulder.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coningsby. This Examination was taken in February, 1740, and I saw the Defendant sign it.</p>
               <p>It was read, and the Purport of it was, That Prior Green surrendered himself the 17th of February, 1740, to the major Part of the Commissioners, and upon Oath said, That the Writing mark'd D, the several Books mark'd A B C, and the Writings mark'd E and F, did contain a full Disclosure of all his Effects.</p>
               <p>Then several Interrogatories, which were sent to the Defendant, were read to the following Effect.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not go from your late Dwelling-house in Cheapside, to the Crown Tavern in or near Bloomsbury?</p>
               <p>The Answer was, - That the Defendant did some Time before the Commission, go to the Crown Tavern in Bloomsbury.</p>
               <p>Did you, or did you not carry with you, an Iron Chest?</p>
               <p>The Defendant said, - He did get a Porter to carry an Iron Chest to the Crown Tavern.</p>
               <p>What was contained in it? What Money, &amp;c.?</p>
               <p>- There were a Silver Tankard, six large Spoons, six small Tea-spoons, and a small Sum of Money, not exceeding 20 l. and no other Effects whatsoever, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The last Question, contained in the Writing mark'd F, was, Did you not, on or about the 13th of November, 1740, pay
