            . On the 8th of last month, my man came up to my chamber, and told me my pigeon-house was broke, and all my pigeons gone. I got up, and went and found the door broke open, and missed thirty-six of them; they are called Toy pigeons: the pigeon-house is over a coach-house, in the parish of Fulham. By searching, my servants found them in the possession of one Reeves, on the Sunday morning, in Westminster: I know them to be my property: I turned them into the lost again. and they all went to their own places as before.</p>

             I was servant to Mr. Dupuis: the pigeons were stolen the 8th of June; we found them on Whitsunday, in the custody of James Reeves, in Westminster. I know them, and can safely swear they are the property of the prosecutor: they were concealed in a little room; he made some objection to our seeing them, till he saw the constable: we questioned him where he got them? he said, the prisoner brought them to him, and said he bought them of a gentleman's servant, in Whitechapel. There were 21 of them.</p>

I was called up, and went in about five minutes; there I saw the prisoner: he begged of me to have mercy on him; he owned he had taken tea out of a cannister, and put it into a paper bag; I suppose it might hold about eight pounds; he being frightened,<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280008"/> put it back into the cannister again.

            . I am servant to the prosecutor. On Wednesday morning, the 20th of June, about 6 o'clock, I went into the shop; upon unlocking the door, I perceived the prisoner at the bar at a cannister, emptying tea into a paper bag. I walked about two yards into the shop before he saw me, I believe; he fell on his knees, and said, I am ruined, I am ruined; What shall I do? I said, I cannot tell what you must do; as I have been suspected in taking of tea, I am obliged to tell my masters of it, and it was in vain to speak to me. He got up from his knees, and went to the paper bag, and returned the tea out of it, into the cannister again, and went up stairs into his own room, and put on the remainder of his cloaths, having then on nothing but his breeches and shirt. In that time, I went and called Mr. Middleditch up, who immediately followed me, as soon as he could put his cloaths on. When I returned, the prisoner was coming along the shop to come to the door, in order to go out: Mr. Middleditch said, Young man, I have a suspicion of your taking the tea; he made no answer: then Mr. Middleditch said, Did you not take the other tea that was missing? he fell down on his knees, and confessed taking about twelve or fourteen pounds before, and had sent it into Suffolk, to one Smallwood, a smuggler, to sell for him: this he also confessed before my Lord Mayor.</p>

               <p>I never did take any, but that time, and that was for my own use, as I had seen the other servants do so before; I was not very well at the time. As to a confession, I said any thing whatever they asked me, but I am quite innocent of it.</p>

               <p>Q. What time of night was it?</p>
               <p>Martin. About twelve o'clock, or a little after: I lodge there, at the house of O'Harra. I said afterwards that I saw the thing done; then they came and took Cornish. I saw the prosecutor walking about all night afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there no watch there?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes, there was.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not go and alarm them?</p>
               <p>Martin. I was afraid, and was sick of an ague and fever, and had no money to pay for a lodging.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the prisoners before?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. to Prosecutor. Do you remember seeing this evidence that night?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor I do, by his cloaths; he was pretty near the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Q. to Martin. What are you by business?</p>
               <p>Martin. I drive a cart.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you see Cornish's face at the time?</p>
               <p>Martin. Yes, and I saw More tie the things up in her apron: I had drank with Robinson at the Black-boy; he went out before me.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you in the alley?</p>
               <p>Martin. I was there to pass time away.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you and Robinson agreed to go into that alley together?</p>
               <p>Martin. No.</p>
               <p>More's Defence.</p>
               <p>I was in Rosemary-lane; I buy and sell old stockings. I met the prosecutor, who said, he thought he knew me; he was very drunk, and gave me 8 d. for a pair of stockings, and I spent seven farthings. He called for eight or nine pints of beer for himself and me, and what people he pleased to give it to; he said, he lived as far as Aldgate, and could not go home that night; he begged of me to get him a lodging: I did my endeavour to bring him to one; he had a bundle under his arm: when we came to the house, he had no more than two-pence half-penny, and the people would not take that, so I came away and left him.</p>

I observed Curtis take the handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket, and put it behind him in his hand, for about half a minute, and Wilkinson took it out of his hand, and put it into his pocket: then I went and told the gentleman: he and I went on the other side the way; then at St. Dunstan's church we took hold of them.

            . My master's house is repairing: I kneeled down in the passage, to call my young master to tea, and saw the prisoner take a pair of shoes off the shelf in the shop; he was at the bottom of the ladder; he was my master's journeyman; he put one in one pocket, and the other in the other, and went out at the door with them; this was about six o'clock in the evening, about a week ago, or better; his business was to cut out. I went down and told my young master the prisoner had got a pair of shoes in his pocket, and he went after him, that is all I know.</p>

            . On the 7th of July, I received a 20 l. bank note of the house-keeper of Lord Ligonier, No. 295; this was on a Saturday, and we missed it on the Monday following. I had the date and No. from the gentlewoman after we had lost it; I do not know it of my own knowledge: I was gone to Bare Key; when I returned, my wife told me the desk was broke, and the note lost: we had a suspicion of the prisoner, he having laid out some money, which he could not give an account how he came by. I was before the justice on two examinations: on the first he denied it; this was on the Monday, before Justice Fielding: he then said, one Toby, a black, had given him two guineas to buy the things that he had bought. The second examination was on the Thursday; then he confessed he broke open the desk, and took this 20 l. note out: his master, a gentleman lodged at our house about eight months; (the prisoner was a black) Mr. Taylor brought the bill to the Justice; we examined it, and found by the date and No. it was my note; he said, two blacks came and changed it with him, but he did not think the prisoner was one of them.</p>

When Fross was taken up, she said Mr. Pullein made it his business to buy handkerchiefs of these boys. (The handkerchiefs produced in court.)</p>

            's, on the 27th of June, in the afternoon, and Sir John's clerk ordered me to call a coach, and drive on; and said, we will come to you: the two Bareav's, (two brothers) were in the coach with me; we went to meet the horse patrole upon the new road to Marybone; we had pistols and hangers: we went up two or three hundred yards beyond the Farthing-pye house; two men came up to the horses heads, and cried, Stop, Stop: they were by the coach door with pistols; Your money, your money; they never stood to see if we would give them any, nor no answer was given them; they fired into the coach directly, yet I received no damage, but Bareav had a ball through his hat; as soon as ever that man fired, I fired at him, and hit him; there was firing on each side the coach in a moment, and away they ran; I fired at Lacey: we jumped out of the coach, and ran after them; I catched him presently; I saw him stagger; we took him into the coach after he had run about two hundred yards. I saw the other man get over a bank, and run cross a field: I saw Bareav take a yellow watch out of Lacey's hands.</p>
               <p>Lacey. I had not opened my mouth before I received a blow out of the coach, which took my right hand to pieces. When we came to the public-house, the Farthing-pye house, I asked for a handkerchief, two of my fingers being loose, and I wanted to wrap them together; the watch was then in my pocket, and I pulled it out immediately before them, but had not an opportunity of speaking, before they snatched it out of my hand, and said here it is.</p>

            's; I went with my brother and Povey, in a coach, as far as Marybone turnpike, to meet the horse-patrole; when, about three hundred yards beyond the Farthing-pye house, I saw Lacey and Edwards come out of the fields, by the side of a rail, to come up to the coach; Edwards damned the coachman, and bid him stand; one came to one side, and the other to the other: he cried, Your money, your money, and immediately fired, and a ball went through my brother's hat: Edwards took a stick, and beat the coachman terribly; my brother put his hand out, and had it almost broke: when they ran away, I slipped down from a bank, and Lacey got upon me, and held a pistol to my head, and said I was a dead man: then assistance came, and he cried, Have mercy, and said, if you go over the ditch, you'll find the other man. We took Lacey to the Farthing-pye house; there he took out the gold watch, and laid it down on the table, and covered it with his handkerchief: I said, hold, there is a watch, and took it out of his hand. Edwards was on my side of the coach; my brother put his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280018"/> pistol close to Edwards, and fired powder in his face. When we were at the round-house, Lacey desired us to go to Tavistock-court, and at a Baker's shop, there we should find Edwards, who kept a whore there, when we came there, the woman said, he had been there, and ran away without his hat; she bid us go to such a place, and we should hear of him: we went to Lacey, and he told us: we found him in bed, and brought him down; this was in Strutton-ground, Westminster. We searched him, and found nothing upon him, but these two penknives here produced: I saw marks of powder on the left side of his face; it was almost full of powder, and his eye was bloodshot; there was a scratch on his face as if done with a shot.</p>
               <p>Q Are you certain that Edwards was one of the two men?</p>
               <p>Bareav. Upon my oath, I am sure he is the man that presented the pistol into the coach.</p>
               <p>Q. What time was this?</p>
               <p>Bareav. This was ten at night, or a little after, and a rainy night: it was not so dark, but I could see him very plain, as he came over the fields; and when he came up to the coach, I could see him plain enough: he d - d the coachman, and bid him stop, and fired into the coach, as soon as he got to the door: I fired after he did, and my brother fired in his face; I took particular notice of them both, and did not fire till they had fired.</p>

            . I was sent on this occasion to apprehend those people: on the 27th of June, I went out on horseback, as far as Marybone turnpike, and through Paddington. Before I got to Marybone turnpike, I heard a noise in Marybone fields; I said to the turnpike-ma n, is any thing the matter? he said, I am afraid there is, for I heard three or four pistols go off. Mr. Povey, the constable, came to me, and said, we have got one of the thieves in the coach, which was Lacey; we brought him to the round-house, and he informed us that Edwards kept a girl in Tavistock-court: we went there, and found he was gone; then Lacey told us he lived up two pair of stairs, at the Half-Moon, in Strutton's-ground; we went, and staid till the people got up; then we went into a two pair of stairs room backwards; he bounced out of bed, and we took him directly; one of his eyes was very much bloodshot, and swelled up, and powder was about his face; when he began to dress him, Mr. Wright clapped his hand on his left breeches pocket, and brought out two penknives, and a key; I gave him the key again: he dressed himself: we searched him, and tied his hands, and brought him to the round-house; one of the knives was a buck-horn one, and the other a plainish handle: when we brought him down stairs, he had never a hat on, and he borrowed a hat to come in.

               <p>I was so unhappy to be persuaded to go out that night; we met that honourable gentleman in a coach; I stood by the coach, in order to bid them stand: Edwards went up to the coach, and demanded what they had; I went up to one side of the coach, and begged of the gentleman; he said he had given what he had, and the two ladies said they had given what they had. I said to Edwards, for God's sake don't make a noise, but come away: then I believe 'Squire Roper delivered two knives, and a key or two; and said, don't take the keys, they'll be of no service to you; I delivered one key, but could not see the other: then the coachman drove on directly, after I begged of Edwards to come away. The coachman drove on towards the town; then we crossed the fields, in order to go to town; that was my intention; I beg'd of Edwards to go to town. As there had been a great noise and disturbance, I was afraid there would be some pursuit after us; we stood by the farthing pye-house some time:<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280019"/> there was a coach went along; we thought it was going to town; we were going the same way: I knew no other than that it was an empty coach, I thought of going to town with it: I no sooner got up to the coach but I received a fire, which tore my hand to pieces. God knows I then thought it was a hard set upon us; I stood a moment or two: they ordered the coachman to drive on; I imagined we were attacked by officers, who were coming to seek for us, to bring us to justice; then I was taken directly and put into the coach, and taken down to the ale-house. I found I was left alone, to the unmerciful weapons they had about them. I could not defend myself in any shape. I voluntarily told where this unhappy young man was: I went to the round-house, a surgeon was sent for, I had two fingers taken off, and my hand drest that night; the next morning I was brought before Sir

            . When this watch was talked of, and the prosecutor was going to justice Welch in order to prosecute the woman, the landlady of the house desired me to go with them, as I could talk French; I went, there came two men; one of them stepped up to the prosecutor, and said, are you willing to have your watch again? he said, yes. Said he, if you'll go along with the woman, I'll go over to the White-hart, and you shall have it immediately. I said, you are not to compound felony upon no account; you ought to acquaint the justice of what you are proceeding about. Then the man at the bar was asked, if the watch was in the same condition it was when he first had it? he said it was; he had delivered it out of his pocket. as I was informed, when they went to fetch him from the round-house, to the keeper of the round-house of St. Giles's, before he came to the justice's. It was produced; there was a dirty black string upon it; and afterwards he owned he had put the gold and silk string upon a watch of his own, that he had been robbed of; the prosecutor described the watch before he saw it.</p>

            . I AM round-house keeper of St. Giles's; the man at the bar was brought to the round-house: I took this watch from him for safety, by Justice Welch's order; he said he gave a woman 25 s. for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know the prisoner before?</p>
               <p>King. I did, I am afraid he keeps a very bad house, and harbours a very bad pack of women; he lives in Diot-street, St. Giles's. [The watch produced, and deposed to by prosecutor, to be the same he was robbed of the might the woman was in his lodging.]</p>
               <p>King. The prosecutor came to see the watch; I told him he should not till he told some particular marks; then he told me the name and number; I opened it, and found it as he had said; he said, when he lost it there was a gold and silk string to it.</p>
               <p>White's Defence.</p>
               <p>I am an unhappy girl of the town; the gentleman was going home; he asked me, if I would go with him to his room: he made a bargain to give me a crown; he had no money, so he gave me his watch; he was to come the next day for it, and to give me the crown: I had been with him before that night; he knew very well where I lived, having been with me at my lodgings at Flaharty's house. I did not tell him I was married; I am no married woman. I staid with him an hour; I kept the watch a fortnight, and he not coming for it, I got a little money upon it, because I wanted it, of my landlord. I have lodged at Mr. Flaharty's house about twelve months; I owed him 4 s. and I paid him that out of a guinea which he gave me for it.</p>
               <p>Flaharty's Defence.</p>
               <p>She told me she had such a thing, that a gentleman owed her some money, and as he could not pay her, she was going to summons him to the court of conscience; she desired me to let her have some money upon it. I being quite innocent, lent her some money; I defy any one to say that I ever wronged them of the value of a pint of beer. I never knew that she had a man up in a room in my house; though I am often out bleeding, drawing teeth, and shaving people.</p>
               <p>For Flaharty.</p>
               <p>Eacklin Mitchel. I am a chandler and grocer; I have known Flaharty eight years and upwards; I<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280023"/> always found him very honest in his dealings; he is honest in that shape: I never was in his house but once, he lets lodgings.</p>
               <p>Tobias Philben. I keep an eating-house in Shoreditch; I have known him seven years; what dealings I have had with him he always paid me for very honestly; I never heard any bad character of him before this.</p>

            . I keep an old iron-shop, in Parker's-Lane; on the 2d of this instant, between eleven and twelve at night (I was gone to bed) the prisoner brought this piece of lead, and got leave of my servant to let him leave it in my yard 'till morning: the next morning he came, as I was opening the shop; I judged it was stole; I told him, if he would bring any sufficient person to prove he came honestly by it, I would give him a market price for it, if not, I should detain that and him too; after that came the officer down the lane; I charged him with the prisoner; he was taken before Justice Cox; there he owned where he took it f rom. There is about 3 l pounds of it.</p>

            . I live at Sunninghill-Wells: on Monday, the 2d of this instant, between eight and nine in the morning, I went into my garden; there were three or four gentleman's servants standing by my fish-pond side: they asked me the reason of the water being so muddy? I seeing my net hanging wet and dirty on the pales, suspected my pond had been robbed. I keep the inn, and sell fish, when gentlemen want any. I enquired of my servants, whether any body had wanted any fish before I was up? they answered, no. I sent

            . I live at Sunning-hill; Mr. Owen sent a man and horse to my house, the 2d of this instant, being the Monday after the races, about nine in the morning, with an order to take a horse, and ride after the Reading machine, in pursuit of the prisoner at the bar, (I had seen the prisoner there all the week before) he suspected he had robbed the fish-pond. I took a horse, and rode to Hounslow; there I had a fresh horse, and made all the expedition I could: just by the New White-Horse-Cellar, in Piccadilly, I saw the prisoner in the street; I hung my mare and went in; I called for some beer, and said we will drink together. I drank with him, on purpose to keep him quiet 'till a constable could be sent for; I sent two or three porters out for a constable; they brought me word they could not get one: the prisoner wanted to go over the way; then I told him he must not go, for I had a suspicion he had robbed Mr. Owen. I sent to Justice Welch, and he sent two men; they tied his hands, and called for a coach: I asked the landlord if the prisoner had brought any thing; he said there was a hamper in the cellar, which was ordered to be brought up and searched; there was some fern at the bottom, with a bundle tied up in a handkerchief, and five brace and a half of fish, very large ones; (five pounds a brace) the landlord of the house will tell how it came there. The hamper was put into the coach, and carried to the justice.</p>

            . I belong to the White Horse-Cellar, in Piccadilly: this bundle ( producing one) has been in my custody ever since; it is now in the same condition it was when I received it. (The prosecutor deposed to the shirt, as his property.)</p>
               <p>Q. to Bromley. Who was the hamper directed for?</p>
               <p>Bromley. For one Smith: Mr. Welch ordered the prisoner to write on a sheet of paper, where he lay last night, and his name; this was in order to see if the writing was alike.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hatchet. Do you keep the White-Horse-Cellar?</p>
               <p>Hatchet. I do; this hamper was brought in the basket by the Reading machine. The direction on it was for one Smith; the hamper was taken out by the coachman: I was present at the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner claim that hamper?</p>
               <p>Hatchet. He said there was a hamper to be taken out; it was delivered to my servant, Jonathan Howard, in my presence: the prisoner ordered the hamper to be taken care of. Some people had sat upon it in the basket behind, and put it out of its form; my servant put his knee against it, in order to press it into its form again. The prisoner said, take care, there is china in it, then he ordered it to be taken down into the cellar which is used as a warehouse for goods that come by the machine; then he went out of the house, with the coachman, and I followed him; the coachman asked me for the carriage of the hamper. The custom is for me to pay, and to receive the money again: the prisoner said, he would pay the shilling, because he knew the person it belonged to; he paid it. When Bromley came, he asked what goods we had come by the Reading machine? I told him. I went with them to the justice, and was at the opening of the hamper; this bundle was taken out: I took off the direction from the hamper, here it is, name Smith. Upon examining the bundle, we found these things, here produced, in it; the prisoner said he knew nothing of the shirt, bowl, or neckcloth.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>Coming down with the Reading machine. I saw, a basket; I believe the coachman took it up at Sunninghill-Well tap-house; the man of the house hollowed to him, and desired him to stop, and sa there was a hamper left there, in order to come to town; that is not the house where Mr. Owen lives. The coachman stopped in the road, about fifty yards from the door: as he was putting it up, I saw it was directed for one Smith, to be left at the White-Horse-Cellar till call'd for; he put it be hind, in the basket, where there were about four or five passengers, they sat down upon it. I knowing one Smith, that had some dealings at Ascott, the race week, thought it belonged to him; I had but very little acquaintance with him; he and I were fellow-servants about a week, at Epson races, about three weeks or a month ago: I told the passengers I believed I knew who that hamper belonged to; I imagined it was full of glusses or china: the coachman was kind enough, upon that, to desire the passengers to take care of the glasses in it. When we came to the White-Horse-Cellar, it was taken down; the coachman asked me, as I knew Mr. Smith, if I would take it to his house.<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280026"/> I said I did not choose to take it; let them put it in the warehouse till he called for it: I said, I did not know where he lived; then the coachman and I went into the house, and sat there about half an hour, and drank two or three pots of beer. Looking through the window, I saw Mr. Owen's man riding past; I ran out after him about fifty yards, and asked him if he would come and drink; he said, he was going into Cheapside; after that, he said, he was going into Fleet-street; there we sat; I was a going, after that, over the way to a gentleman of Hounslow; I saw him go in there: he said, sit down; I said, I shall not stay: I did not know what he was about then, or I had taken it away before: he bid me sit down, and said, I'll be ingenuous with you, and tell you what I came about; we had drank three or four pints of negus: he sent for a constable, and I was taken before Justice Welch; the hamper was opened; I had no more suspicion of what was there, than your lordship; there was a bundle: Mr. Welch asked me where this Smith was, and who he was; I said, I did not know his Christian name, nor where he lived; and if I had brought myself into a premunire, it was unknown to me.</p>

            . I live in Houndsditch, and am a brasier. The two prisoners came to my shop, on the 27th of June, and brought forty-five copper hoops, seven brass hooks, and a screw; I never had seen such before, being but young in trade: I gave them 9 d. a pound for the hoops, and 7 d. a pound for the other things; the day after a gentleman said they were stole, and shewed me the King's broad arrow upon some of them, which I did not see before. They came again on the 18th of July, with fifty-three more copper hoops; I weighed them, and kept them in discourse, while I sent my maid out for an officer; she not meeting with one, I said they must come again to-morrow. Last Friday they came into my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280028"/> neighbourhood, and were taken up in Gravel-lane: they were taken before my Lord Mayor; there they said they found them in a bush. (Produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Furnis and Mr. Dalton, officers belonging to his Majesty's stores, deposed, there were hundreds of copper hoops, which belong to the powder magazine at Greenwich missing, of the same make and sort, the property of his Majesty; and that the prisoners were two matrosses, whose business it was, in their turn, to watch the magazine.</p>

               <p>Watson's Defence.</p>
               <p>Griffin is my comrade; he came and told me a young man had shewn him a quantity of such things in the field. About a month after we went that way, and saw them lying there; and as we could neither write nor read, we did not know the broad arrow; we thought they were as lawfully ours, as any body's else.</p>

               <p>I was walking on the bank, and a young man gave me a call down to a hedge; he said he had found a parcel of things; I saw them, but did not remove them; they lay there a month after; then we thought we might sell them.</p>

He was to have workmen come to repair it; he desired me to go to Mr. Denton's, in Grey's-Inn-lane, where he had a lodging, to lie with his wife: he said he would take care of my goods; I thought my goods were very safe; I carried them to the Crown Tavern: this was about March, 1762.</p>
               <p>Q. What things did you carry?</p>
               <p>M. Adderley. I carried a clock and case, a bureau chest of drawers, a bed and bedding, and the things mentioned in the indictment: I put them into two rooms, that I was to have, when they were repaired; then I went to his lodging at Mr. Denton's, by his directions, and he lay in my room: he came home on the sabbath-day, before I missed my goods, and dined with his family; and told me every thing was safe; and on the Tuesday after I went there, and Mr. Crook's servant set a ladder and got over, and opened the great door; I went in, and found the padlock that fastened the door lying in the window, and the key in it; my door was open; I had trusted that key with Mr. Crook; the other keys of my<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176407280029"/> drawers and places I had in my pocket, all but two; I let him have a key of one drawer, as he said he wanted that drawer to lay some papers in: I found my drawers open; one of my locks was entirely off; my book-case was wide open; the drawers were forced open; there lay two chissels, one was broke, and the other not: all the things were taken out of the drawers. I went into the other room; there I found my locks broke, and all the goods mentioned in the indictment were gone, (mentioning them by name): then I went and got Mrs. Brabiner to go with me again to see the rooms.</p>
               <p>Q. When was this?</p>
               <p>M. Adderley. This was in 1762, I can't tell exactly the month; it was about November. I advertised directly, and Mr. Wild, a pawnbroker in Aldersgate-street, where some of my goods were pledged, sent to me; and I took a constable, and went and saw them: the constable took an account of every thing: there was pewter, brass, linen, a gown, and a petticoat, part of the goods mentioned in the indictment: I found no more of the goods than what I found there.</p>

               <p>Q. How long had you been acquainted with Mr. Crook?</p>
               <p>M. Adderley. I had been acquainted with him about half a year before my goods were there.</p>

               <p>Adderley. Mr. Adderley told me there was coming to me 900 l. as near as I can remember and I trusted him with this letter of attorney to receive it.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this letter of attorney.</p>
               <p>Adderley. (She takes it in her hand) This name of mine is my own hand writing; I gave it so as to receive it myself: I was against making a letter of attorney; I did not understand the nature of it; Crook is now indebted to me.</p>

She, Mr. Winbolt, and Mr. Crook, came to my chambers on that account: she came to my chambers a second time; I had it read over very distinctly to her; it was duly executed, and she signed her name to it. I am well persuaded she understood every word contained in it; I read it over very distinctly in March 1763. Some time after she lost her things, she came to my chambers, and said she would have her papers containing the accounts with Mr. Cotrell; I said, you have my three guineas, pay me my money, I don't want to be concerned with such people as you: said she, Mr. Crook shall pay you, and takes and sweeps all the papers into her apron, and would take them away; she said she would have them; I said, you shall not have the letter of attorney, and insisted she should not have that, and that she let me have again, and I would particularly exempt that in the receipt which she proposed to give me. At this time, she told me she had lost a great variety of things; he had much more than the value of the three guineas; I think she said, he had pawned the things, and she had part of the money, either then or at another time. A person had arrested her, and thrown her into the Poultry-Compter: Mr. Crook came and told me of it, and I believe he got bail for her, and she was discharged; this was in 1762, about June or July: she admitted to me that he had paid money for her, to obtain her discharge. She came to me on the 18th of March, 1763, and I think that was the time she admitted he had part of the money: she declared to me at the time she had her papers away, that she never had heard this letter of attorney read over.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you think of her capacity, as to her knowledge of the letter of attorney?</p>
               <p>Mason. I read it over so distinctly, because I thought she might not be so well aware of it; but all things considered, I apprehend she knew what she was about very well.</p>
               <p>Mr. Denton. There was one Brown left 650 l. in East-India annuities to Mr. Crook, and there being some contest in the commons about it, he was perplexed, and by that means his pocket was drained of every thing, and I lent him money: after that, he gave a bond to Mr. Adney, and Mr. Adney lent him money to carry on the cause: this was on the 17th of December, 1762. I saw those annuities in the book, in the East-India house, and I was informed of Mr. Crook being taken up by Mr. Girdler: I desired he might be examined again, and Mr. Girdler thought proper to have another magistrate in the affair, which was Sir

               <p>Mrs. Adderley. I let him pawn some spoons once for 6 s. when I wanted money; but I did not give him leave to break open my drawers, or to pawn any of these things.</p>

Said she, I could be glad to have my goods again that Mr. Crook has pawned: I gave him the key to open the drawers, where he took out some things, and pawned them: there was a gold watch, a gold ring, and a pair of sheets: she did agree to have done with it, if Mr. Crook would let her have her things again, but it was out of his power to fetch them.</p>

About twelve or one o'clock at night, we met a man in Church-lane, with a soldier's hat and coat *; the next morning, when we brought what prisoners we had got, to Mr. Welch's office; we found the two prisoners had been in company with Etridge and one Husk: Mr. Welch examined Etridge, who told us where to find the prisoners: I was ordered, with others, to go and see for them. About six in the evening, I met with Husk and Dunn together; I said, there is a young led in the round-house, pray take a walk and see him; I got them there, and ordered the keeper to secure them: then Husk, when before Mr. Welch, said they were in company together, and they robbed a gentleman of a yellow watch: Moody could not be found, but was taken at last in Tottenham-court-road: Husk told me I should find the watch in a cellar, in Monmouth-street; Mr. Welch sent me there, and the woman brought it to the justices.</p>

            . On the 29th of June, the prisoner came to pledge two hats with me: I live at the bottom of Wood-street, near Cripplegate. I examined the hats, and said I did not like them; he took them from the counter. Some few minutes after, a woman on the opposite side the street came and told me a man had stole a hat that was near my door, and ran up Wood-street; I ran up to him and laid hold of him, and desired him to walk back: as I was coming back, a woman told me she saw him put a hat down a cellar window; which we found in the cellar; it was my property, and was in my shop before he came in.</p>

            . On Tuesday the 10th of July, between four and six in the afternoon, I was standing at my shop door: the prisoner came and put his hand upon my arm, and said, step to the window; I went; he asked me what a ring hanging there would come to; I said, about 14 or 16 s. he desired me to weigh it for him; I did, and told him it came to 16 s. he pulled out half a crown, 1 s. and 6 d. and laid the ring on the counter; he told me he had lost half a guinea out of his pocket; he said, Sir, it is all the same, I'll leave you a shilling and the ring: he gave me a piece of paper with a counterfeit ring and a shilling; I had seen him take up my ring and put it into his pocket. When he was gone, I opened the paper to look at my ring, and found I was deceived; I ran out, and happened to take the right way: I ran up Hart-street, and at the upper end I saw him; when I had been twenty or thirty yards in Monkwell-street, he run as hard as he could, and turned into Silver-street; I pursued him into the Castle and Faulcon yard: he stopped running, and was opening the paper to look at the ring: I got up to him, and laid hold of him, and said, my friend, you shall not drop the ring: I took hold of his hand, and led him to the first public house I came to, and desired Mr. Hayns, who was there, to open the prisoner's hand; he did, and there I took out my ring: bringing him back in Monkwell-street, he desired I would not take hold of his coat to expose him, saying, he had a great family; I let go his coat: when we came to the corner of Hart-street, he endeavoured to escape, and ran as hard as he could; and we took him again in Wood-street. (The ring produced and deposed to, and the shilling also which he left.)</p>

            , clerk to Smith, Wright and Gray, struggling together. Ware had hold of the prisoner, and the prisoner was striving to get away; Ware called to me, and begged, for Christ's sake, I would stop that man, for he had robbed him of near 50 l. upon which I ran up and seized him by the collar, and the moment I laid hold on him he flung something from him, down into a cellar opposite to him. I told Ware, whatever he had lost, the man had flung down into that cellar; we took him into the shop, and the man of the house and Mr. Ware went down into the cellar, while I took care of him; they came up, and said they could find nothing: they went down again with a candle, and brought the bag up, and when they had told the money over, there wanted a guinea, upon which Ware went down and brought up two half guineas. The bag was not tied but twisted round at the neck. We took him before my Lord-Mayor, and he was committed. Mr. Ware and his masters are Quakers, and he will not swear.</p>
               <p>Edward Williams, the master of the cellar, confirmed the account of finding the bag and money.</p>

She came down, but not till after he was out, and said they had had a pig's foot for supper, and he was gone for another; the next morning, before it was light, they both went out: she said she should be at home by one o'clock. They never returned: on the Monday I miss'd my things, mentioned in the indictment; part of them were let with the lodging-room to him; my wearing-apparel were taken out of the garret: she was so officious she would make the garret bed for me, before she went away; I suppose she took them.</p>

I went up stairs, and saw my breeches were moved; he was a fellow-servant of mine: I live with Mr. Freestone, at the Bunch-of-Grapes, in the Spaw Fields. I had one pound sixteen shillings and a groat in my breeches, but that was gone; I saw it at going to bed; he was taken the Friday following, and carried before Justice Cowley; there he owned he had taken my money, to buy cloaths: when he was brought to my master's, he said he had taken twenty-two shillings, and that was all: he was committed to New-Prison. I did not get a farthing of my money again; he said he had laid it all out.</p>
