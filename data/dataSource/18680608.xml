                  </hi>. I am a warehouseman, in Friday Street, City—the prisoner Eliza Chadwick, was in my employment—previous to July, 1867, I carried on the business of a shawl mauufacturer, and a dealer in Winseys, I was afterwards desirous of superadding the mantle business; for that purpose I engaged the female prisoner, at a salary of 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—I had known her for four or five years previously—she left in the middle of January—she had requested an increase of wages; I refused—the matter came before Mr. Commissioner Kerr, on 30th March, and was adjourned until some future day—when I went back to my premises on 30th March, I received certain information from my workpeople, in consequence I communicated with the police at Bow Street, and Cheshire the constable was sent to me—I went with him to the prisoner's house in Fore Street—I saw her there, and a Mr. Townsend, and a number of workpeople, as well as the male prisoner and Mrs. Hall—I found a considerable quantity of property there, this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—this is all my property, I have examined it all—its value is</p>

               <p>about 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 130<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the female prisoner had no interest in the business beyond her weekly wages—she never sent a mantle to me at Glasgow.</p>

COLLINS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When you first knew Mrs. Chadwick, was she not carrying on business? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She took out work to make up for people, and I have given her work occasionally in that time before she came into my service—I believe she kept workpeople for that purpose—I think she entered my service in August, 1867, and was with me four, five, or six months—I bought a sewing machine of her at the time I took her into my employment—I believe it was in use for some time before I bought it, I paid the rent of her work room, and took it off her hand, except the sewing machine which I did not want, for I had a great many of my own—I don't believe I have sold her anything while she was in my employment; the only thing I am aware of is a piece of winsey, which she did not pay for—I don't remember her saying that she had got an order to make some pattern jackets for a Mr. Izant, a manufacturer—I did not attend to the details of the department, Mr. Crystal did—I can't say it did not happen, it is very possible, it would be shown in the books—I say that all the things produced are mine; on some of them there are marks—this chenielle is our own manufacture and could not be bought, we do not sell them separately; it is for fringing shawls; it is manufactured by us at Glasgow—we had it in our warehouse at London—here is a piece of cloth with the handwriting of Mr. Crystal on it, that I recognize, also the number of the ticket corresponding with our invoice—I recognize my clerk's writing on it—she never designed patterns at her own house out of my materials, to my knowledge—I never told her to do so, I would not have allowed it—she did not come to teach me the mantle making business, she came to conduct the workwomen—I never gave her a book of patterns to design from on the Sunday; if she had it, it was for the use of the department; I took up a book of fashions and asked her if she could see anything there to put into the shape of a mantle—I believe she has been at my brother's at Glasgow, I never saw her there, she told me so—she was simply a workwoman there—after she left me, Mrs. Hall superintended the workwomen—she only staid a fortnight or three weeks, a Mrs. Simpson took her place, and she is there now—I do not change my servants fre<lb/>quently, Mr. Crystal has been with me fourteen years—when I went before Mr. Commissioner Kerr, he told me I must have a jury—I did not ask that Mrs. Chadwick might find the jury, nor did my solicitor, nor did the Commissioner say, "No, if you want a jury you must have one," nothing to that effect—the case is still adjourned—she is suing me for 6<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., a month's salary—I offered her a week's salary instead of a week's notice—she owes me as much as she claims, because she never paid me for the piece of winsey, which she got unknown to me—she did not take out the summons for a month or a few weeks—I employed Messrs. Parker, Lee and Hammond, of St. Paul's Church Yard, my present solicitors, to defend me at the Sheriff's Court—the prisoner came to me the day after she left, and said if I did not pay her she would sue me—the summons was not taken out for a month, it was heard on the 30th, I went to her house that day—I found twelve or fifteen work girls there, they were doing the identical work that I was, for she stole my patterns; I found them there—I gave her into custody—she showed me all the materials she had there—these (<hi rend="italic">pro<lb/>duced</hi>) are all my patterns—she did not design any of them, these patterns are cut from large pieces, we sell the cuttings at threepence a pound—the</p>

               <p>prisoner has not designed all these patterns, she designed tome and I have designed a good many myself, and so has Mr. Crystal and others; I believe nearly all the young ladies would occasionally suggest a pattern—I do not manufacture the whole of these things nor are they made expressly for me, I buy at Leeds, Manchester, and London, in the open market, other per<lb/>sons may buy similar articles—before the prisoner entered my service I occasionally gave her out things to make; and others did the same, she could not have made a living out of what I gave her, Mr. Crystal occa<lb/>sionally gave things out, and sometimes if I have been in Scotland, my brothers may have done it; I was in partnership with my brothers, but we dissolved in September last.</p>

On the afternoon of 30th March, I accompanied Mr. Gow to Chadwick's—I said to Mrs. Chadwick that Mr. Gow had told me he had reason to believe she had some of his property in the house, and I more particularly wished to see a velvet jacket which she had worn that day at the County Court—she said, "Oh yes, you can see it;" and she went to a cupboard and brought out a velvet jacket—Miss Reed, who accompanied us, said, "That is the jacket I told you about, it was cut off your materials stolen from your place"—Mr. Gow then gave Mrs. Chadwick into custody—she claimed all the property we found as her own—I then told her I should search the house—I did so with Fawke, who was with me, and took away a portion of the property now produced—I afterwards took away the remainder—the male prisoner came into the room before we searched the house—I told him we were police officers, that Mrs. Chadwick was in custody, and that I should search the house—he became very abusive, and said, "You are a police officer, are you?"—I said, "Yes"—he opened the door and said he would throw me down from the top to the bottom and break my neck—I had to take up a poker to him to prevent his doing it.</p>

I am the solicitor conducting this prosecution—I was instructed on Monday, 6th April—after I saw Mr. Cave I expressed a desire to see the prisoner, and he came to me between 12 and 1 o'clock—Mr. Cave was then in another office—I told the prisoner that a forged cheque had been passed at the City Bank on Saturday afternoon, that I had been told that he was the last person in the office, and I asked him to give me an account of where he had been, and what he observed when he had been in and out of the office, during the day—I told him also the cheque had been paid in four 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and I put a great many questions to see if he could throw any light upon it—he said he had been there early in the morning, that he went out for a few minutes and returned, and went out again about 11 o'clock, he came back at 1 and left at 1.30—he told the housekeeper that if he was not back in a few minutes he should not return that day—the matter then rested for about ten days, till the notes came in, and we traced them—I sent again for the prisoner on the 20th—he was brought to my office by the officer—I then showed the prisoner the two 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. notes, and pointed out the name and address on them, and asked him if he knew the handwriting, he said "No, he did not"—he turned the notes over and handed them back to me, and said he had not seen them before—I then sent for Mr. Dixon—he was waiting, in another room—I showed him a note, and asked if he had received it in payment for some articles of clothing, and if he would know the person from whom he received it—he said yes, the prisoner was the person—the prisoner said "No you are wrong" or "You have made a mistake"—Mr. Dixon said "I have made no mistake, I saw you write that name and address"—the prisoner said "That is not the note I gave you, Mr. Dixon"—"Oh yes it is, I am quite sure"—I asked the prisoner if he had any further explanation to give, he said nothing whatever—I then gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a member of the firm of Sole and Turner, solicitors to the assignees—I was first consulted about this matter on 29th February, on the part of the creditors—I first saw the bankrupt at a meeting of the creditors on the 29th; Mr. Croft, his solicitor, was present—the bankrupt was asked questions by me as to his property generally—he was first asked with regard to his debts, and particularly as to a debt he owed Mr. Parker, in the list of creditors, 65<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was written upon an erasure of 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which excited some suspicion in my mind, and I asked him whether he really owed</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186806080024"/>
               <p>the money—he hesitated, and said that he did not owe the money, or words to that effect—I then pressed him, and said, "Have you given up all your property to the messenger or creditors?"—he said, "I suppose I may as well tell the truth (looking at Mr. Croft); I have not done so"—he was further pressed, and he said that he had made this bill of sale to Mr. Lewis, and that the furniture had been removed, all excepting about 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—he also said that part of the stock had been removed at the same time—I understood from him that there had been no consideration for the bill of sale—upon that information we applied for a search warrant, which was granted—he said he had been badly advised—I asked him who drew up the bill of sale, and he said, "Mr. Stanley, a solicitor"—he also referred to Mr. Parker, who was secretary to some water supply association.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> This information that you received from him was at a meeting of the creditors? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—a great many persons were present; one of the largest creditors, Mr. Bouch, was in the chair—the bankrupt attended the meeting readily—it is usual to cross-examine at these meetings—I have had some experience in cross-examining—I found what he stated was correct, as to the place where the property was—I don't know, person<lb/>ally, what amount of property was found there; I have heard—I think his debts amount to 2000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., I won't be sure—(<hi rend="italic">referring to the proceedings</hi>) the total liabilities unsecured are put down at 1266<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the total assets are 510<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; deficiency, 756<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—this is the official assignee's report, which has the seal of the Court, "Furniture, 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; stock in trade, 355<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; other property, 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I have no doubt the lease is included in that 145<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—the prisoner makes his deficiency 736<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the official assignee 756.—he has passed his last examination, and has an allowance of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. per week—the assignee gave that allowance, and I consented.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a solicitor—I am on the Rolls, but not cer<lb/>tificated—I am clerk to a person named Parker, who is secretary to the Metropolitan Water Supply Association—I am a director of the company—I knew the defendant some weeks previous to his bankruptcy; I was intro<lb/>duced to him by Parker—after being introduced to him I prepared a bill of sale from the bankrupt to a person of the name of Lewis—I prepared it by Mr. Cook's instructions—I did not see the grantee under that bill of sale, or ask to see him—I told Mr. Cook I would procure him some money to get him out of his difficulties, to carry him over the March quarter—I drew the bill of sale—it is destroyed—I destroyed it after he was made bankrupt, and I found it was not available—it was registered on the same day that he became bankrupt—I believe I destroyed it on the Monday following—the 27th was on a Thursday—I tore it up and put it on the fire, at 2, Bream's Buildings, Chancery Lane—it had been left there since 10th February—that is Parker's office, the office of the Water Supply Association—I saw no consideration money paid for it, nor did I see any grantee—I filed it myself, and with it an affidavit—I attested the execution of the bill of sale—I know Mr. Lewis—I had known him for many years—this (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) is a copy of the bill of sale—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th February</hi>, 1868, <hi rend="italic">and was an assignment by Jonathan Cook, of</hi> 152, <hi rend="italic">Old Kent Road, Draper, to George Lewis, of</hi> 10, <hi rend="italic">Victoria Road, Peckham, of all his goods and utensils named in a schedule, in consideration of a sum of</hi> 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., <hi rend="italic">to be repaid by half-yearly payments, with interest at the rate of</hi> 15<hi rend="italic">per cent</hi>.)—there purports to be a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> You know, do you not, that Mr. Lewis does advance money on many occasions? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I have known him more than twenty years, and I have had many hundred pounds of his through my hands—Mr. Parker is here to-day: he was before the Magistrate—I don't think he has been before the Grand Jury—the prisoner told me that if he could get some money he could still go on with his business—I then told him that I could get him some money upon a bill of sale—I had not the slightest doubt that Mr. Lewis would have done it—I had known about the prisoner's affairs for some time before—he was very desirous indeed to go on with his business, and objected in every possible form to becoming a bankrupt.</p>

               <p>no more to me as to what I was to say, they went away; they were not there above five or six minutes—I did not say that I would or would not attend, I said nothing at the time they came to me—I said, "No; at any rate I will meet you to-morrow at the Bankruptcy Court—I went there—I saw five or six persons there, Cook, Parker, and several others—they said nothing to me at that time—they had a consultation between them, and I then heard there was going to be a meeting of creditors on Saturday morn<lb/>ing—on the Sunday Cook and Parker came to my house, Cook then told me that he had explained everything to the assignees, that he had made a clean breast of it, and given up everything.</p>

I am a cheesemonger, at 5, Farringdon Road—on 4th May Rodgers came into my shop about 12 o'clock for two pennyworth of cheese, he gave me a shilling in payment—I gave him the change and put the shilling in the till, there was only a florin there—after he left Brown came in for a rasher of bacon, and gave me a shilling—when he left a constable came in and spoke to me—I went to the till and found two bad shillings—I crossed the road to speak to the constable and saw the two prisoners together, at the corner of Farringdon Street—as soon as they saw me speak to him they walked off down Farringdon Street—Brown came in again on the 14th of May for two pennyworth of cheese—he paid me, a bad shilling—I sent for a constable immediately and gave him into custody, and gave the three bad shillings to the policeman Holt.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a merchant, of Enfield, and am one of the trustees of the prisoner's marriage settlement—my co-trustees are Mr. Drinkwater and Mr. Jordan—it is for the benefit of the wife first, who has separate use, then to the husband, and then to the children—the prisoner has applied to us from time to time to alter it—he filed a Bill in the Court of Chancery, which we answered; after that he sent letters from time to time without threats, but of an angry nature—I afterwards received this letter (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—I know the prisoner's writing—it is his writing, but it is not signed—I heard him admit writing it, at the Mansion House—I am the person to whom it is written—I have received other letters from time to time, and have been the subject of other threats—(<hi rend="italic">The letter was addressed Joseph Henry Jackson, dated 25th April, 1866, and contained the following expressions</hi>) "Although this letter is addressed to you, it is intended equally for your co-trustees. My wife distinctly stated that she would not oppose me, whether she approved of my course or not. I have to tell you that if you do not withdraw from the trusteeship of my marriage settlement, you must make up your mind to go further, and apply that I shall be placed under restraint, for as sure as there is a Heaven and a Hell, so sure shall I, and take this in its most extended meaning, be driven to an act of violence of no common or remediable kind. The uncontrollable feeling of revenge now raging in my breast must ere long end in a crime, the result of which will be a scaffold, if this country will consent for a person to be sacrificed when he has been driven to commit murder. I trust that the three weeks granted to a criminal to make his peace with God will be sufficient to enable me to do so. It may be that the time is at hand when the wife and the children of one of you will be a widow and fatherless."</p>

He begged that he might not be sent out into the world again while the present trustees continued, lest his feelings, now dormant, should arouse him to greater fury, for so long as the cause of those feelings existed, and his rights were not restored to him, he preferred confinement to liberty</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of Thomas Milwood, of 13, Charlton Street, Fitzroy Square—on 15th May, about 12 o'clock at night, there was a knock at my door, and I recognized the prisoner's voice, who occupied the third floor back—he was insulting a woman, a customer of ours—I opened the door and he pushed her, called her very bad names, and told her to go in—my husband told him he would not have a customer of his insulted, the prisoner turned on my husband and wished him to come into the street to fight; he said he did not wish to strike an old man, but after a great many insults my husband did strike him—the prisoner then said, "I will set fire to the whole lot in the house"—his wife and son persuaded him to go to his room—he was very drunk—about 3 o'clock in the morning I was aroused by his wife calling to him from the top floor to put out the fire—he was in the yard—my room was full of smoke, and smelt strongly of fire—he made a rattling of pails in the yard and said, "I am trying to put it out"—I opened the bedroom door and saw three lodgers coming down stairs, they told me to get out of the place as it was on fire—the fire was in the back yard, in a closet adjoining the dust hole, which is made of wood—there were empty wooden boxes in it, and shavings, rags, paper, and wood—the dust hole is outside the house, but joins it against the brick wall of the house—the wooden door of the dust hole touches the window sill of the cellar where there are paraffin cans—it is a general shop, we sell almost everything—there was very little in the paraffin cans, we had drained them; there were also butter tubs, soda tubs, and shavings, in the cellar close to the window—my husband and the other men lodgers went down and put the fire out—about 11 o'clock in the morning the prisoner got up, he began abusing me and my husband—he gave me messages which he wished me to give to my husband—I told him to take them himself—I said "You are not a man to go and try to set fire to the place last night," he said "Yes, I did it with a candle, and I will do it again."</p>

I am a surgeon, of Walham Green—on 22nd May, about 7 o'clock, I saw the child's body at the police-station, Walham Green—it was tied up first in newspapers and then two or three linen or calico wrappers—a thick cloth was completely round the head or over the head and face, and tied under the neck so tightly in two or three knots that I had some difficulty in undoing it—the nose was pressed down flat to the face by the pressure of the cloth—there were several pins, to keep it closer I presume, and in two or three places the cloth was stitched; it was stitched all over the body, and on the head and face as well—the tongue and eyes were protruding, the lips were swollen, the nostrils compressed, and there was bloody fluid issuing from the mouth, which had stained the cloth; the neck was discolored where the cloth had pressed; the fingers were drawn in and pressed on the palms, and the nails were discoloured and black—I made a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination at the workhouse, but found no evidence of disease—the age was from two to twelve months—the brain was very much congested, and the vessels of the brain in the same way—the lungs were collapsed—suffoca<lb/>tion, such as would be caused by these wrappers, was the cause of death—it had been dead about two days.</p>

I live at 8, George Place, Queen's Road, Chelsea, and know the prisoner by living at Madam Azens' three weeks, she lived next door to me—on Thursday, 21st May, about 10 o'clock in the morning, she brought me these three petticoats, red frock, and spotted pinafore—she said that she had been to see a young woman, a friend of her's, last evening, who had been in the same trouble that she was in, and had given her these few things to help her; that they were not dirty, neither were they, but she wanted them washed and mangled to put them away clean, and she would call for them, but she never did—I washed them and had them mangled.</p>

                  </hi>. I am in the employment of the Post-Office—on the evening of the 29th of May the prisoner was employed in the newspaper department—about 5.10 I noticed him push a small packet into the cover, and threw it on to the south-eastern dividing table—I called the attention of the Superintendent, who examined the parcel—shortly after 7 o'clock I noticed the prisoner with the packet in his hand, in the Eastern Counties division—he threw it into a basket underneath the sorting table, and it remained there fire or ten minutes—he then took the basket round to the south end of the office, took the packet out of the basket, and again examined it—he then threw the packet into the basket again, took some more packets out of another basket, and placed them in the basket where the packet was—he then turned the eastern dividing table with basket containing the packets, and took that packet (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) from the bottom of the basket, and placed it in one of the pigeon-holes—he then emptied the packets on to the table—at that time the collector came and took the things out of the pigeon-holes—there were other things there—the prisoner put his hand forward and took this packet back again out of the pigeon-hole, making some remark which I did not hear—he then passed near where I was standing, and passed the packet under his coat on the left-hand side—he then returned to the Great Eastern dividing table—I sought Mr. Swift, and made a communication to him—I could see nothing in his hand when he returned.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an inspector of letter carriers—the prisoner was employed to sort letters at the Great Eastern Division table—if he found one there by mistake, he should have put it in what is called the "Blind Place," which is intended to receive missorted packets—these are cleared by homebody else—between 7 and 8 on the evening of the 29th of May, in consequence of a communication from Willins, I went to the prisoner, and took him into my room and said, "It has been reported to me that you have put a packet in your pocket; if there is no truth in it you will say so"—he said, "It is only a paper"—he took out of his left-hand pocket the packet—I said, "This is evidently a packet which appears to be passing through the office, and not your own"—he said, "No, sir, it is not my own, and I intended to place it on the packet table when I went again for the packets"—I then saw Crocker, and gave him into custody—Crocker searched and found two newspapers and a pamphlet—the prisoner had no right to put the packet in his pocket—it was not his duty to examine their contents.</p>

                  </hi> I live at 58, Queen's Road, Dalston—on the night of the 19th May, I went to a public-house, the Old Kent, Nichol Street—Bailey came in and said, "It is a nice day, sir"—I said, "Yes"—he went out and returned shortly afterwards with two others—Hutchinson was one—a young gentleman and two boys were with me—Bailey charged me with committing an abominable crime on the two boys—the boys were not with me the second time he come in—I forget whether he said "intending to commit," or "having committed"—Bailey and the man not in custody unbuttoned my coat and exposed my guard—I struggled and called to the landlord to send for the police—he got me out—there were ten or twelve more in the bar—the doors were closed and I was left with Bailey, who held</p>

               <p>me by the right shoulder, and Hutchinson was at my back—the landlord passed me in the street and told me to run—I said, "Oh, good God, I shall be run down, pray send for the police and protect me"—I was knocked down two or three times, once on the steps of a door, and forced into a passage—I was then held down by four men, one kneeling on my left loin—I cried "Murder!"—two hands were passed, one tore away my watch and the other my guard—I heard cries of "Police!"—the men got off me—I got up and was knocked down again—a policeman came and I made a statement—at 12 o'clock that night I saw Bailey and gave him in custody near the spot—I saw Hutchison the next day at the Police Court, and gave him into custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I carry on business at Chard, in Somersetshire, and among other branches of business have been since 1866 a manufacturer of cider—in 1866 I employed the prisoner as my agent for the sale of cider in London—I consigned it to him, and the invoices generally bore his name, but there were some exceptions—that arrangement was found to work not quite satisfactorily, and in February or March, 1867, I entered into a new arrangement with him—the goods were to be delivered to various customers and credited to me—the prisoner was to obtain the orders and send them to me at Chard, and I had to deliver the goods—I had new invoices pre<lb/>pared, and this of Mr. Hickman's is one of them—I call the prisoner my agent—there is a notification that the accounts are to be paid on and after 15th October—the prisoner had to obtain the orders, see to the return of the empties, and to collect the money in October—his remuneration was 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. per gallon for the cider sold—he was to receive from me duplicates of the invoices I had sent in, and apply to the various customers from 15th October to December for the money, and on receiving it to remit it to me—in the commencement of 1867, I received orders from him and executed them—one of them was from Mr. Laurence—besides the orders he sent me during 1867, I had an order direct from Mr. Hickman, which I executed, and on the approach of 15th October I directed the prisoner to call for the money, and afterwards received from him this letter—(<hi rend="italic">This was dated October</hi> 16<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1867, <hi rend="italic">and signed C.

               <p>this bill here is "Mr. Mayle, London Agent"—I have had transactions direct from the customers without his having any share in it—I have had a very large number of transactions through him—after February or March, 1867, he was my London Manager, not "Agent," but the bills have London agent on them down to the present time—he obtains a customer named Brown in London, writes to me to say that Mr. Brown wants a barrel of cider, I send the barrel direct to Mr. Brown, and presuming my clerk to act correctly, he would send the invoice to Mayle, to deliver to the customer, and the money would be paid to Mayle on that invoice at the end of the season and not as each came in—in 1866, he gave me a bill of exchange on account, which was dishonoured, and I sent the money for him to take it up, but he kept both—he paid me the amount 42<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. two months afterwards, January 3rd—I sent him 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to take it up on 23rd October, and he kept that, it was perfectly at his option in 1866, whether he got orders for me or not—the second arrangement was in March, 1867, he then had to communicate with me—I sent Mr. Brown the cider and the invoice, and sent the prisoner an invoice as well at the end of the season—I sent them all in a lump for collection—the invoices were from 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. upwards—if Mr. Brown had three or four quantities of cider it would all be put in one total—he had three months to collect the money in, he was not to collect it on any particular day—15th October is the end of the season—I am in London very often; I did not always see him when I came up—I believe an agent is a person employed to do anything for another person.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 17, Grenville Park, Blackheath, and I am secretary to the Hop and Malt Company—about 5.30 on the afternoon of 4th December last, I saw a cab upset near the Company's premises, over a mound of earth at the side of the road—it was driven by a person named Bracey—I went and examined the horse—it was rather dusk, and I ordered him up to a gas lamp—I examined the horse, there was nothing the matter with it—its knees were not cut—no one else was there but myself and the cabman—the lamp irons of the cab were broken and the hood was cracked, that was all the damage done to the cab—the horse was dark brown, about 13 hands 2, with a rat tail—I ordered the man to call next day, but no one came—on 16th December, in consequence of an applica<lb/>tion which took place and a letter coming to me, I went to the yard of the prisoner with one of the directors, Mr. Grundy, and the architect, Mr. Moore—I saw the prisoner, he is a cab proprietor, at Henry Street, Gray's, Inn Road—I told him that I was the secretary to the Hop and Malt Exchange Company, I had come with the director, Mr. Grundy, and the architect, to see the horse and cab which was overturned on 4th December, in Southwark Street—he then said to a man, "Bring out that black mare which met with the accident"—a black mare was then brought out by the man Jones—it had a frightful sloughing wound on the off fore-knee—I said, "How comes it that the accident only happened a few days ago and that the knee is in that dreadful state?"—the prisoner said, "Well it is rather peculiar, but the mare's blood must have been in a bad state when she fell"—I said immediately I saw it, "That is not the horse,"—the prisoner</p>

I was in Mr. Case's yard when the horse and cab was brought home by Bracey—he said he had been upset in Southwark Street—I saw the horse; it was a brown mare, but black from her joints—she was brown from being singed—her legs were washed—the off-side knee was cut—the dirt was washed out with hot water—the other knee was rubbed with gravel—I saw her next day in the stable—she was not driven out by Bracey; he drove a bay mare—I went with Mr. Case to the Company's place next day, and they said the contractor was liable.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at 102, Star Street, Edgware Road—I entered that service of the prisoner in February, 1862—he was then carrying on business at 1, Sermon Lane, St. Paul's Church Yard, as a woollen merchant, I may say as a general merchant, under the firm of Thomas Edgley &amp; Co.—Mr. Henry Edward Watts was a partner in the firm—at that time there was no other firm carried on by the prisoner—afterwards, in May, 1863, an establishment was opened at 88, Oxford Street, under the name of Grant and Co.; that was a mantle and shawl warehouse—Thomas Edgley &amp; Co. were the members of that firm; that is Edgley &amp; Watts—subsequently to that the firm of Whytall &amp; Co., of 46, High Holborn, became merged in it—the firm was Whytall, Elliott, &amp; Co., woollen drapers—Elliott went out of it, and Whytall made an assignment to Edgley &amp; Co.—Whytall &amp; Elliott are both dead—1 think in or about 1864 that business became merged into Mr. Edgley's—there was a firm of E. H. Watts &amp; Co. at Leeds, in 1862, when I went into the employment—the prisoner and Watts were members of that firm—they were woollen manufacturers—that firm had an account with the Leeds Banking Company—in 1862 or 1863 the firm of Edgley &amp; Co., in London, were in the habit of receiving bills signed by Jacob Van Cleef, from abroad—the letters, as a rule, came from Paris—I have seen several of the bills with the heading of "Maydempeck;" they were not accepted by E.

Edgley, either Mr. Edgley or Mr. Watts, signed by Mr. Edgley or Mr. Watts—I have been in the habit of receiving cheques for that purpose once a week, or ten days, or a fortnight, perhaps, according to the time that the bills arrived at maturity—I received orders from Mr. Edgley or Mr. Watts to take up the bills or notes—the bills probably would become due to-day, and Mr. Edgley would give me a cheque on the following morning, and say, "Grant, go and take up these bills or notes of Van Cleef's"—he might have given orders about other notes and bills besides Van Cleef's, in several instances—I recollect Van Cleef s, that was by word of mouth—I then went about to the different notaries to find out where Van Cleef's bills were—I always cashed the cheque before 1 took up the bills, and paid them in bank notes—that proceeding continued I may say from the middle of 1863, taking up bill of various descriptions, up to the failure of the Leeds Banking Company, on 17th September, 1864—when I got the notes I brought them back to the prisoner—Edgley &amp; Co. were in the habit of receiving these promissory notes from Van Cleef, to the best of my belief, up to the end of 1863—Van Cleef's bills did not go up to 1864—the Maydempeck Forest Company's bills succeeded Van Cleef's—this bill-book is not in my handwriting; the first part of it is in Mr. Green's, the second is Mr. Bertram's, he his here—I heard of Van Cleef's bankruptcy—up to that time I believe Edgley &amp; Co. were in the habit of receiving his promissory notes—I can't be certain when that was—this bill-book was kept in the counting-house of Thomas Edgley &amp; Co., and was referred to by them from time to time—towards the end of 1863, Mr. Bertram was a clerk in the office, I think he came in the early part of 1863 or the latter end of 1862—towards the end of 1863 or the beginning of 1864 I heard the prisoner say to him, "Bertram, go and get some bill forms, if possible, in the French language," and Bertram, I believe, obtained them at Mr. Biden's, in Cheapside—they were filled up for certain amounts, under the direction of Mr. Edgley, and placed on his desk, and then transmitted to the Leeds Banking Company for discount—the name of E.

H. Watts and Co., by Watts, the body written by Bertram, and the signature, E. Devillers, by the prisoner—here are 30 bills of that class, of different dates, from 1st March to 25th August, all endorsed by Watts—I have here five bills in French, dated 27th February, 1864, signed by Edgley in the name of Devillers, in favor of A. Teal and Co., and endorsed by Teal and Co. in Teal's own handwriting; they are all written in the same way—I knew a firm of A. Teal and Co.; in Leeds—I know Teal personally: Edgley and Co. had business transactions with them—here are 39 bills in English, on foreign stamps, signed and endorsed in the same way, and they bear Greenland's endorsement as well—those bills were passed through the Leeds Bank by Teal and Co., the whole of them are endorsed by Greenland—the body of them is in Bertram's writing, the dates range from 10th March to 25th August, 1864—here is another class, part 4, bills in favor of Teal and Co., they are in English, signed by Edgley in the name of E. Devillers, endorsed by Teal, the body in Bertram's writing—here are one or two that I should say were in Bertram's handwriting, and many of them an imitation—(<hi rend="italic">selecting</hi>) that is what I consider a genuine one, and this I consider a good imitation—I don't say it is an imitation by Edgley, I believe it to be in Teal's handwriting; I am not an expert in handwriting, but I should think here are about eight imitations of Bertram's writing, there are ten altogether in the packet; the dates are from 10th March to 25th August, 1864—here is a single bill for 1120<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., dated 24th May, 1864, in English</p>

               <p>on a foreign bill stamp, in favor of E. H. Watts and Co., signed "E Devillers," I wrote the name of Devillers there—the body is written by Bertram, and it is endorsed by Mr. Watts—that bill was drawn in June, 1864, during Mr. Edgley's absence on the continent, in Servia, at the Forest—when he came back I told him this bill of the Maydempeck Forest Company was coming due during his absence, and I signed it E. Devillers—that was by no order, I volunteered to sign it—he said, "All right, keep your own counsel, and it will be all right"—after I had signed it, the bill was sent to the Leeds bank to be discounted, and the proceeds of it used to take up one of the Maydempeck bills that was becoming due at that time—the Leeds bank returned us drafts at two months, through Smith, Payne, and Smith, their agents—all the Maydempeck Forest bills with the signature of Devillers were made payable at the London and Westminster bank—Edgley had no account there, he banked at the Imperial bank—here is a bill signed by Teal, in the name of Devillers, dated 20th August, 1864, for 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., in favor of Teal and Co., it is endorsed by Teal and Co., and the body of the bill is in Teal's writing, in imitation of Bertram's—none of it is in Edgley's writing—there is another bill for 1430<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., dated 20th August, the body of which is in Teal's writing, and the signature, E. Devillers, is Mr. Edgley's; that is to the order of Alfred Teal, and endorsed by Alfred Teal, the body is Teal's writing, in imitation of Bertram's—all the bills in favor of Watts and Co. were entered in the defendant's bill book, we were extremely particular that such should be the case—we kept no note whatever of those in favor of Teal and Co.—they were forwarded directly by Mr. Edgley to Teal—I have taken up several of those when they arrived at maturity; Teal would give us notice a day or two before, and I went, in the same manner to the various notaries but Teal always forwarded the money first—the amounts of the bills were given to Bertram sometimes by me, but as a rule by Mr. Edgley—and the dates—the exact date was not stated, he merely told him to ante-date them for 15 or perhaps 20 days—I have heard that said—I got the amounts from the diary kept of the bills falling current.</p>

Mr. Greenland has seen this letter, so you need not notice it, read it and return it to me by first post. I am advising Van Cleef to go at once to the spot and make sure that all is and will be right as to the delivery of the railway sleepers. I hand you also the letter received this day, and you will see they want the 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill cashed; it is not likely that could be done in Paris, and besides Hayn is not here to draw it. What can I do in the matter? In fact, Mr. Teal, I advise you, as a friend, not to let this bill go out into the world, you know the time comes when it is due and cross bills like this has a very bad effect; what would your banker say to seeing either Van Cleef's name or our name on an acceptance of yours; think of it and take my advice; I have explained to Mr. Greenland the nature of these timber or Forest of Peck bills, and you need have no difficulty in offering the other one and taking out a draft on London, for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. Do this by return, and I will send you back your acceptance. Far better for you to got a remittance close up from Van Cleef and Co., for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., than to be on a bill an acceptor for them. I have done more than my part and given them 300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for your cheque besides."</p>
               <p>"You see by his second letter of the 19th that he only waits a cheque for your bill for 500<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to be able to arrange everything to go off to the Danube; so now the matter is in your hands; do as you like, only do it at once, for I am sure it is highly important; but after this I shall not inter<lb/>fere in any arrangement of the kind.

There were only one or two continental customers to my knowledge; they were chiefly in various parts of this kingdom, and some of the best houses in the kingdom and in the colonies—the business at 188, Oxford-street was originally the business of Walter Joyce and Co., who were debtors to Mr. Edgley and failed to a large amount—it then became Grant and Co., Grant being your humble servant—they tried to make the best they could out of a very bad bargain, and a bad bargain it was for them—they owed Edgley and Co. between 1300<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. and 1400<hi rend="italic">l</hi>—I was not a partner—I accepted the bills—it was done if possible to recoup the amount they had lost—that was also the nature of the transaction with respect to the firm of Whytall and Co., Holborn—I have not taken the trouble to ascertain the amount of the bills of Van Cleef which were in existence prior to the stoppage of the Leeds bank—I have not the least idea of the amount—I believe they were all in respect of commercial transactions of a <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> character—I believe they were for goods which Edgley sold to Van Cleef, and that they represented bills which were renewed from time to time—I only know that from what I learnt from the ledger—I believe that was the nature of the original debt before I entered the service—that was to the amount of about 9,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I believe that during the time I was in Mr. Edgley's service Van Cleef's bills represented bond fide transactions.</p>

               <p>proportion of the 60,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was in reference to transactions between them—I should say that the bills which were sent out for and filled up to be dis<lb/>counted, were to honor acceptances coming due which had their foundation in <hi rend="italic">bond fide</hi> transactions—some of the bills produced, I believe, were to cover Van Cleef's acceptances—money was transmitted to Maydempeck on several occasions while I was in Mr. Edgley's service, to the amount of some thousands—I am speaking of money transmitted by Edgley to Maydempeck in respect of which bills were drawn and discounted by the Leeds Banking Company—the money that was transmitted was raised on acceptances of E. H. Watts and Co. or Edgley and Co., discounted by the Leeds Banking Company, 12000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or more was sent in that way—the bills contained in the account of the Maydempeck Company were ante-dated 8, 9, and 11 days—they were all dated London or Leeds—if they were drawn in the name of Desire or the other names they would be dated Maydempeck—they were all made in London—I do not remember money being sent out to Maydempeck before the date of the agreement between Edgley and Teal—I won't undertake to say it. was not so—Mr. Edgley went to Servia on three or four occasions—the first time I believe was in the early part of 1863—he was absent for about two months, I should think—I do not remember remitting money to him on that occasion—he went again about August, 1863—he was then absent five or six weeks, to the best of my belief—we received letters from him very regularly—I certainly had a notion that the whole thing was bond <hi rend="italic">fide</hi>—I believed it to be a perfect Eldorado—in the simplicity of my nature, I might have believed that if the Leeds bank had not stopped, it would have turned out an Eldorado—I know that Mr. Edgley chartered ships bring timber from Servia—I do not know how many—I knew it from con<lb/>versations that I heard between Mr. Edgley and Mr. Waargan and one or two others—Mr. Waargan is a ship-broker in the City—I overheard conversations between him and Mr. Edgley with reference to the ships being chartered—I cannot give you the particulars—the door of the counting-house was open at the time—the charter parties did not come under my observation—I do not know whether Desire was the son of Van Cleef—I never saw him, and I never had a conversation even with Van Cleef—I have seen a man they call Van Cleef, or Jacobs, on one or two occasions at Edgley's—I have never been present at any conversations between him and Edgley—I did not know of plant and machinery being sent out by Edgley to Servia—I do not remem<lb/>ber Edgley telling me of Van Cleef having become bankrupt—I heard him tell parties in the counting-house, casual persons who came in, that he had obtained an assignment of Van Cleef's interest in the con<lb/>cession—I believe he went out purposely to obtain it—I did not hear him say that he had instituted legal proceedings in Servia for the purpose of enforcing his right—I heard him say that Van Cleef was a stubborn devil and that he did not think he should get it out of him, but that he had made him give it up—I remember some conversation about Van Cleef's creditors in Paris endeavouring to upset the assignment, and that he had been obliged to take legal proceedings in foreign courts to establish his rights; that was the substance of it—all the bills having relation to the affairs of Thomas Edgley and Co., are entered in the bill books and in the ledger—we were very particular in entering every bill—these books were kept either by Edgley or his clerks, and were open at the counting house to the end—all the transactions were entered.</p>

Frolich, of Pesth—they are bankers there—I do not know how Frolich disbursed it—I saw Devillers first in 1864, at 1; Sermon Lane—he came there as a clerk in the counting-house—he remained three or four months—I had seen him before, in the summer of 1864, on a casual visit to his uncle, Mr. Edgley—when he was a clerk in the office he made entries of the various sales, and made out the invoices at Mr. Edgley's desire—he was totally unacquainted with and ignorant of commercial matters—I believe it was Mr. Edgley's desire to make something of him if he could—I have seen him here to-day—he is about twenty-five or twenty-six years of age—the Maydempeck-Company's name was not up at Sermon Lane—I know nothing of any such company or its. affairs.</p>

                  </hi>. I was a clerk at Edgley &amp; Co.'s from January, 1863, to July, 1865—I remember being directed to purchase some blank bills of exchange in the French language—that might have been in the early part of 1864, I can't exactly remember—I did so—I filled up a great number of them—a paper was given to me containing the particulars—Mr. Grant would give me the paper, and sometimes, perhaps, Mr. Edgley—the paper contained directions as to the time the bill was to run, and the amount—I have here one bill which is in my handwriting—it has the word Maydempeck on it—I filled up all that which forms the body of the bill—bills were not kept in blank ready signed to be filled up—I know on one occasion there were blank forms purporting to be signed by E. Devillers—I can't tell who wrote the name of Devillers—I believe it was written by Mr. Edgley—I cannot tell how many of them there were, it is so long ago—perhaps there may have been five or six, I cannot say the number—I cannot say there might not have been a dozen—that might have been in some part of 1864, but I cannot fix the time—the bills that I had to fill up were to run for about six months—I ante-dated them, according to my instructions, perhaps ten,</p>

               <p>twelve, or fifteen days, or something of that sort—when I had filled them up I put them before Mr. Edgley, in his private office, and they were sent to the Leeds bank for discount—I examined all the bills that were pro<lb/>duced before the Magistrate—they did not all bear my writing, only some of them—here is one that was not filled up by me—that is a bill of the 16th March—and here is a promissory note of the same date, not filled up by me—it is very much like my writing—I believe it may have been written by Mr. Teal—I am struck by the imitation of my writing—at first I was almost doubtful whether I did not write it—it is a very good imitation indeed—that has the signature of E. Devillers to it, I believe in Mr. Edgley's writing—it looks very much like his, but that may be an imitation for all I know—Mr. Teal, in the ordinary course of things, did not write at all like me.</p>

Parry and Waargan, the ship agents, who chartered the ship for Mr. Edgley—it was in the English language, and I had to translate it in a foreign language to send to the agent—it was a list giving the names, the tonnage, and all the particulars of the ships—as far as</p>

               <p>I can remember it contained a list of five vessels—Mr. Edgley gave me the list, and said "Make a translation of it"—I do not remember haying any sub<lb/>sequent conversation with him about them—I know ship brokers of the name of Theologus &amp; Carnegie, at Galatz, on the banks of the Danube—I have seen Mr. Carnegie at Sermon Lane—I think it was a little after I had made the translation of the document—I have seen him come to visit Mr. Edgley on various occasions, but I do not remember any conversations.</p>

I a clerk in the office of Mr. Turquand, the official liquidator of the Leeds bank—under the superintendence of Mr. Turquand I have had the affairs of the Leeds bank to a great extent in my hands—I have gone through Mr. Edgley's books, and made out certain accounts in respect thereof—the books are here—I have gone through such parts of his transactions as refer to the Maydempeck Forest Company—they are divisible into three classes, the first consists of bills purporting to be drawn for the Maydempeck Company payable to the order of E. H. Watts and Co., and dis<lb/>counted with the Leeds bank, and the proceeds used for the purposes of Van Cleef's acceptances—the second class consists of bills purporting to be drawn by the Maydempeck Company in favor of A.

Watts &amp;Co.—those are contained in Edgley's ledger, headed "Maydempeck Forest Company joint account of the defendant and Teal"—I have taken out the gross amounts represented by those different classes of transactions—the total amount of bills drawn under the first class is 67, 786<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., under the second 84, 820<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and under the third 31, 454<hi rend="italic">l</hi>, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—they extend from 8th December, 1863, to 17th September, 1884—I have looked into the prisoner's cash book to ascertain what amount of money he represents himself to have transmitted to Servia; it is about 12,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., from November 6th, 1863, to August 6th, 1864—that is as an account with Johann Samuel Frolich, banker, of Pesth—the account is in ducats—the mode of disbursement is shown on the other side of the account—on 6th November, 1863, here is "Self 200 ducats," that was a cheque drawn by the prisoner on Frolich—the money transmitted to his account he of course</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> At the time you instituted these proceedings, under the direction of the Court, were you under the belief that the bills were forgeries? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was; my information was, that the defendant had signed these bills—I do not know that it was stated that it was without Devillers' sanction, but that the signature was not the signa<lb/>ture of Devillers—I believe it was upon that charge of forgery that the warrant against Mr. Edgley was obtained—in the first instance, I think, the sanction of the Vice Chancellor was that he should be prosecuted for forgery; but we have been more than once before the Vice Chancellor as the case has assumed its different features—two or three months previous to the deed of inspectorship, Mr. Edgley put himself in communication with me about his indebtedness to the Leeds bank, in common with the other debtors—I think I have seen him in Leeds—he came forward when<lb/>ever he was required to give information with reference to his transactions with the bank—I was the only liquidator; Mr. Young, my partner, did not interfere—Messrs. Bond were solicitors, in Leeds, to the liquidators, Messrs. Freshfields, in London—Mr. Denton, now of the firm of Crowder &amp; Maynard, was there, until the appointment of the liquidator, as the representative of Messrs. Smith, Payne &amp; Smith, the largest creditors; he was then with Messrs. Freshfields—I can't say whether the defendant also gave information to Mr. Denton—I have no doubt he presented himself whenever he was required—he was carrying on business up to December, 1864—I don't think he was carrying on the business; I think he virtually suspended payment as soon as the Leeds bank stopped—I cannot charge my memory whether I had a conversation with Mr. Edgley, at that time, about the Maydempeck Forest business; I think it is very likely—I think he stated that he had been out there on several occasions, and that he had sent out ships for the purpose of bringing home timber from the Danube—I have heard that it was so, but when and from whom I cannot tell; but I think, in all probability, from Mr. Edgley himself—an order may have been ob<lb/>tained by his inspectors, on 17th December, 1864, to take possession of whatever property might be found at the forest, or in the vessels; I think not by me—I have no recollection of any order upon Van Cleef and Denelly to receive any amounts due to him; I should think his inspectors would have obtained that—I concurred in Mr. Dresser's being sent over to obtain whatever timber there was felled, or on board ships—if I recollect right, the inspectors sent him over; I don't think I did—the inspectors were Mr. Butler, and Mr. Young, my partner—that was done with the sanction and concurrence of Mr. Edgley—it was either in 1864 or 1865, very soon after the failure of the bank—I think Mr. Edgley offered to accompany Mr. Dresser, for the purpose of rendering every facility he could in obtaining any property that might be there—I believe he gave notice that he would surrender at the Mansion House on the charge of forgery; and he did surrender, without being taken into custody.</p>

Teal &amp; Co. of Leeds, had accounts at our bank—they stopped payment immediately after the bank stopped—I found the agreement of 8th of January, 1864, among Teal's papers after his failure—the securities of the bank were kept in a safe, and a security book was kept in the same place—at the time of the failure of the bank there was no security, that I know of, in the possession of the bank, relating to the Maydempeck Forest Company, I saw none, nor any securities for the bills of Watts &amp; Co., or Teal &amp; Co. which we discounted—there is no entry of any such in the securities book—the book is here.</p>

I am a merchant, at present carrying on business at 16, Bishopsgate Street—I have a house at Galatz—I am in partnership with John Robertson Theologus—the first time I ever heard of Mr. Edgley, or of the house of Edgley &amp; Co., was the receipt of a letter from London enclosing bills of lading for a shipment coming by steamer to Galatz—that was in the Bummer of 1862—the shipment was for winches, ropes, and gear to be used in working the forest, with instructions to forward them to Van Cleef, at Belgrade—our business was to re-ship them from Galatz up the Danube—that letter was signed Edgley &amp; Co.—the next I heard of the forest was when I returned to England in 1863—Van Cleef and Edgley came to me and asked me to make a contract for carrying timber home—that was at the end of 1862, or the beginning of 1863—afterwards I had to see Van Cleef in Paris; we differed about the rate, and it came to nothing—I was in England in February, 1864—I then received a letter of instructions from Edgley, containing five charter-parties of the <hi rend="italic">Hercules</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Dwina</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Memel</hi>—I saw Mr. Edgley at his office, and he showed me some correspondence from Denelly, his agent, about the timber being sent down—he asked me if I would take charge of the shipments of the timber—I agreed to it, and after I returned to the Danube, the ships arrived and applied to me for cargo—Van Cleef had then failed, and the forest was sequestered—no large timber came down, but five vessels loaded with staves arrived from the upper river—Mr. Edgley came down to Galats, and wrote me a letter, a copy of which I have, giving me instructions what to do—I loaded the <hi rend="italic">Memel</hi> with maize, because there was no timber, to the ac<lb/>count of Mr. Edgley, and I loaded the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> with staves, which is timber—I loaded the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi> with the remainder of the staves, and filled her up with maize for the account of Mr. Edgley—I afterwards came to England, and when the ships arrived, I dealt with the cargoes under letters of instruction from Mr. Edgley—I have copies of the letters—he had agreed to take up the documents, that is, the bills of lading, on their arrival here—he did not do so, and I then obtained his consent to placing the goods in the hands of Churchill and Sims, for the sale of whom it might concern—the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Memel</hi> arrived in this country about August or September, but the <hi rend="italic">Chard</hi> not till December—the gross of the dealings with the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Memel</hi>, as far as my memory will serve me, was about 3000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and the <hi rend="italic">Chard's</hi> account was about 1000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I saw the quality of the wood—a portion of the <hi rend="italic">Jamaica's</hi> cargo realized the largest price of any cargo of staves of that year—I have never been to the forest myself, but I know it well by renown and character—it is of enomous extent—in 1864, the inspector of Mr. Edgley's estate sent for me and asked me to take up the forest of Villa Ritza, and also to inquire into the forest of Maydempeck—we worked out the forest of Villa Ritza, and also reported upon Maydempeck, to Messrs.

               <p>Cleef, and others who had then got possession of the timber—I never went to Maydempeck Forest itself—I know of the three cargoes of timber of my own knowledge—as soon as Van Cleef knew that Edgley had stopped payment, he sequestered the five ships of timber of which I held the bills of lading; I went to where three of them were, in the domains of Austria, I could not get possession of them, but those that were below the Iron gates I took possession of, and towed to Galatz, and I made a contract to send a steamer to tow the five vessels down, and under the direction of the Consular Court at Galatz, we sold the two river boats to pay for the towage of the steamers: the other three Van Cleef kept in Austria.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a farmer, living at Lewisham—the two prisoners were labourers in my employment—on Thursday, the 7 th May last, I found the skin of a lamb under some bushes in a field where my lambs are kept—the prisoners live on the farm, and there is a cooking-house for the convenience of the men—there are cupboards in the cooking house—the prisoners have one cupboard between them—in consequence of some suspicion I went with a policeman, between 11 and 12 on the night of the 10th, to the cooking-house—there was a pot stewing on the fire, with two necks of lamb, and two ribs in it—in the prisoner's cupboard I found a leg of lamb cooked, and a shoulder uncooked—there was a basket hanging up with another shoulder in it—I then went home, and left two constables to watch—on the morning of the 11th the prisoners were taken into custody, and I charged them with stealing the lamb—Webb said he bought it at Bromley—Johnson said he found the lamb cast in a furrow, and had dressed it—I asked him what he had done with the skin—he said he had put it in a hedge near Strawberry-hill gate—I found it in an adjoining field, in a ditch some distance from where he told me—it was the skin of a lamb 10 or 11 weeks old—I know the skin to be mine—it had been recently killed—the lamb was worth about 32<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—if he found the lamb cast in a furrow it would be his duty to bring it to me.</p>

               <p>metal bolts, which I produce—I said, "How long have you had these bolts?"—he said, "I have had them some time, I bought them with other old metal"—I then went into a shed in the back yard, and underneath several bundles of rags in one corner, I found these metal pintles—I said, "These are what I am looking for; how do you account for having these? they have been stolen"—he began crying, and said, "I wish I had told you the truth at first; I bought them of a man, I do not know his name, but I believe he is a dredgerman"—I said, "What did you give for them?"—he said, "3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I said, "Have you got anymore, because I intend making further search"—he said, "Yes, but do forgive me"—I then went into the back of the shop, and from the middle of a large heap of rags, the prisoner pulled out a metal bearing, weighing nearly three-quarters of a hundredweight—he said, "There, that is all I hare got, so help me God! now you can search the house freely"—I asked him where he got it from; he said "Of the same man"—I then went upstairs, and found a bag of new nails—I asked him how much he gave for the metal—he said, "I gave 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the pintles, and nearly 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the bearing; I can't say to a 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., or a 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>."—I asked him if he had made any entry in his books of having bought such things—he said, "No"—he showed me his books, and there was no entry.</p>

               <p>the potman—he was the only one put out—the landlord afterwards told us it was time to go, and we all went out—I was talking to Joseph Neale, and as I got to the top of the Jew's Road an elderly gentleman said, "Good night"—I said, "Good night," and as I turned round a man came up, shoved his hand to my side, and ran towards York Road, Battersea, saying, "Come on"—another one ran with him, and the elderly gentlemen stopped—I then felt a pain in my side, rubbed it, and found my entrails out in my hand—I was in severe pain for a good while—I was laid up for seven weeks—I had had a little beer, but was quite sensible—I cannot swear to the prisoner, it was done in a moment, and I only saw the man's back—I had not quarrelled with anyone.</p>

I am a waterman, of 2, Catherine Terrace, York Road, Wandsworth—I had been in the public-house, and when I was opposite the Jew's Road I saw Neale and Finnigan, eight or nine yards from me—I saw the prisoner draw a knife or a dagger out of his pocket, stab it with force into Finnigan's side, and run away, and another man with him—Finnigan called out, "I am stabbed,"—I undid his trousers, found blood there, and assisted him—a surgeon was called—I was sober—I swear it was the prisoner who did it—it was Betteridge who was put out of the public-house.</p>

               <p>afterwards communicated to my daughter what she told me—I told his mother that he was indebted to me and that the bill was not paid—she told me he was dead, that he died in Dublin—I told her I had received a letter—she did not say whether she had written it or not; she did not say anything against it, she did not deny it—I have not got the envelope—(<hi rend="italic">Read</hi> "Miss Rickaby, Madam—This is a painful duty for me to perform but one that must be done; I much regret that you, upon such a short knowledge of the party, should ever have married. You are not his wife by law, for Reeve was not his name, he only took it on the stage, and was under age when he took you. You need not fret, the poor fellow died on 24th of last month, of small pox; he asked me never to let you know his name was not Reeve, but now he is gone it can make no difference to him; then if your child lives, never call him Reeve, Bryant Ruther was his right name. I can say no more, I thought it right to let you know all. I send this to you through your father, not knowing where to find you, only your father through Moon's office.") The letter came through the office of Mr. Moon, hop merchant, who I was doing business for at that time, I called on the mother after I had received this to see what she intended to pay me towards the bill and towards my expenses for keeping my daughter—the bill fell due in 1864—I did not make inquiries immediately, I kept it over—I thought he might return, or they might become friends again—I received this letter in 1865 and went and saw her shortly after within eight or ten days—my daughter was living at my house then—I communicated to her everything that I knew—the letter was sent to me, but was written for her—I might have destroyed the envelope at the time, for I sent it under cover in my own letter, just enclosed—my daughter went into mourning in consequence of the statement I made to her; I put on slight mourning myself, a hat band and so on; I believed the statement made by the mother and I should say my daughter did—I never saw or heard of him since in any way until this trial.</p>

                  </hi>.—I am beadle of the Borough Market—about ten o'clock on the night in question I was in York Street, and heard a cry of "Police!"—I ran under the railway arch and saw the prisoner running, and the prosecutor after him, about two or three yards behind; I took up the pursuit—the prisoner ran round the railing of St. Saviour's Church, and up some steps, and I lost sight of him—I turned round again and saw him running towards me—there was a van near the place where 1 lost sight of him—the prisoner said to me, "Did you stop him?"—I caught hold of him and said, "You are the man"—I brought him back to the bottom of the steps where the prosecutor stood, and he said, "That is the man that robbed me"—the prisoner then said, "You did not see me behind the van"—I had not said anything about the van before he mentioned it—I sent one of the market porters for a constable, and I gave the prisoner to him—I then went behind the van, and lit some paper—I there found this tobacco pouch, purse, and ring—I handed them to the constable, in the prosecutor's presence, and he said they were his property—there was some dust behind the van, and a hole had been scraped, and the purse and other things put into it.</p>
