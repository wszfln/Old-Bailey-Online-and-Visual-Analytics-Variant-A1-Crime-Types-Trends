             the son has struck her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she lie after she was bound apprentice?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Sometimes on the boards in the parlour, sometimes in the passage, and very often down in the cellar.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to lie there?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She had the misfortune of wetting the bed; that was the reason of her being moved; at first she had a mat to lie on.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any thing to cover her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Sometimes she had her own clothes, and sometimes a bit of a blanket.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any particular place where she used generally to lie?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Yes, in the cellar, where they used to lock us in; it goes under the kitchen stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. How big was the place under the stairs?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. It is about the bigness of a closet; it went in and turned under the stairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she any bed there?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Sometimes she had a bit of a sack with some straw in it.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she to cover her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Sometimes she had something to cover her, and sometimes a bit of a blanket, and sometimes she was quite naked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she chiefly lie there?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She did.</p>
               <p>Q. How many beds had your master in his house?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There was a bed in every room in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any lodgers in the house?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There was when

             first to lie in that place?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She was an hungry for want of victuals, and she got up one night and opened the cupboard-door, thinking to get some victuals.</p>
               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot tell justly when it was, it may be pretty near twelve months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she found out in going to the cupboard?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. My mistress I think it was that found the cupboard door broke open.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she take out of the cupboard?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There was nothing for her to take out.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you with her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, I was not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done to her upon this?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. My mistress made her strip naked to wash, and beat her all the while at times.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. She was naked washing all the day.</p>

               <p>Q. How many times did she beat her that day?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot justly tell; she beat her every now and then.</p>
               <p>Q. How old was she?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She was going into fifteen.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she taller or shorter than you?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She was taller a great deal than me.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she beat her with?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She beat her with a stump of a riding whip.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part did she beat her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Her head and shoulders were mostly beaten.</p>

               <p>Q. Who took them out?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I was employed to take them out; my mistress ordered me to shift them out into a large coal-hole; then Mary Clifford continued to be there.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it of her own accord?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, my mistress went down with her, and saw her locked in with a small padlock the first time she lay there; she was locked in on nights.</p>
               <p>Q. What time had she used to be locked in?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Just before candle light.</p>

               <p>Q. Did any body else lock her in?</p>

             the eldest son has locked us in, when they have gone into the country on a Saturday night, and they have returned on the Sunday night; I used to be locked in with her from the Saturday night to the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. How often may they have gone into the country on a Saturday, and staid till Sunday night?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I believe they may six or seven times.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any bed to lie on in that place?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, we used to get some rags out of the fore-garret, and sometimes we had used to put our own clothes on; sometimes we had only a boy's waistcoat; my mistress used to order us to take off our clothes.</p>
               <p>Q. For what reason?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She never told us why; if she saw a hole in our clothes, she would say we should not wear them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to provide you with clothes?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She did.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. On the Sunday night.</p>
               <p>Q. What victuals had you to eat the time you were in?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. A piece of bread, nothing but bread.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. About half a year ago.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did he beat her, and for what?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Once he beat her with a leather strap, for not turning up a parlour bed; she was trying to turn up a press bed, and could not, so he took a leather strap which my master used to put round his waist, for my mistress to lay hold by when she rode behind him.</p>

             was dressed when John beat her.</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She had on a boy's waistcoat, it was a very old rag, it did not cover her well; it came very high before, but was torn on each shoulder; it did not cover her behind.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it buttoned?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, it was pinned.</p>
               <p>Counsel. He did not beat her hard?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. He did, as hard as he could strike; she seemed as if she had not strength to turn up the bed; she had lifted it, but could not push it up; he said he would make her lift it up, he knew she could.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she attempting to raise the bed when he beat her with this leather belt?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he hurt her much?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Yes, I believe he did; her head and shoulders were not well at the time she had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090005"/> been beat before by my mistress; the wounds were just scabbed over; my mistress used to be often beating her; John made her head and shoulders bleed very much.</p>
               <p>Q. Which end of the belt did he strike her with?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. By all appearance it seemed to be by the buckle end; I cannot say I actually saw the buckle.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I was in the room all the time.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you say you believe it was the buckle end, if you did not see the buckle?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Because she bled so much.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was he in beating her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot tell; he might be about five minutes.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blows did he give her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot tell, he gave her a great many; he struck her eight or ten times, and then he would stop, to see if she would put up the bed; after that, he struck her again, and after he had beat her, he pushed the bed up himself.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she bleed much?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There was a pretty deal upon the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Where must it come from?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Chiefly from her shoulders; her shoulders were bleeding.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the blood you saw upon the ground, was blood from

               <p>M. Mitchel. She might have shoes on, but stockings she seldom wore.</p>

               <p>Q. Whether the waistcoat she had on was bloody?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. That I cannot justly say; there was blood upon her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Recollect who else you saw beat her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Once I saw James my master beat her with an old hearth-brush; I never saw that but once to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you recollect the time your master beat her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. That I cannot justly say; I cannot pretend to tell, because I do not know how time passed.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did your mistress use to beat her most?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She used to beat her in the kitchen most.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you remember any particular time?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, I cannot.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot justly say.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did she use to beat her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She used to tie her up in the kitchen; when first she began to be at her, she used to tie her up to the water-pipe, with her two hands drawed up above her head.</p>
               <p>Q. Describe that water-pipe.</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. That goes across the kitchen; the hooks that hold it are fastened into a beam.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she used to have her clothes on when your mistress tied her up in this manner to beat her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, no clothes at all.</p>
               <p>Q. How came that?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. It was my mistress's pleasure that she should take her clothes off.</p>
               <p>Q. What had she used to beat her with?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She beat her most commonly with a horse-whip.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she use to beat her in this manner?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot justly say, but she seldom left off till she had fetched blood.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a whip?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. It was a riding-whip, that my master used to ride with.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was it?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I fansy it might be a yard long; she was tied to the water-pipe no longer than while my mistress was beating her.</p>
               <p>Q. When did your mistress begin to tie her up to the water-pipe?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. To the best of my remembrance it was before the warm weather began this year, but I cannot justly say; lately she has been tied up to a hook.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account of that hook.</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There was one day talk about a hook; my mistress was angry, and asked my master why he did not put up the hook; he told her he would, and that day he did put up the hook.</p>
               <p>Q. In what way did she express her anger?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She said she would beat us.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did she talk of beating?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. We were both to be beat.</p>
               <p>Q. How long is that ago, since they talked about putting up the hook?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I believe it is about three months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabout did he put up the hook?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090006"/>M. Mitchel. That was whereabout the jack had been, upon the same beam where the water-pipe run under.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did she ask her husband to put up the hook?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. That was towards dinner-time; she was threatening us then.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fastened up?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There was a screw went into the beam, and the part the rope went into was like a ring.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was up, what use was made of it?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No other than to tie us both up.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was put up, how long was it before any body was beat?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel.

               <p>M. Mitchel. No body made use of it but my mistress; we were tied with our hands over our heads, and the rope went through the ring.</p>
               <p>Q. How was she dressed when tied up?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She was never dressed when tied up; she never was tied up but when she was quite naked.</p>
               <p>Q. By what part was she tied?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She was only tied by her hands; she was always beat till she bled.</p>

            ?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, there was no body to assist her; she was always beat with the whip.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body beat her when she was tied up to the hook besides your mistress?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, no body else did; John came down once when my mistress had been beating her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this before you were taken away?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. This might be about six months before the hook was put up: my mistress told him she could not make her do any thing.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this before John beat her about the press-bed?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I believe it was not long after that.</p>
               <p>Q. What passed?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She had been beating her with the whip, quite naked; she was then tied up, to the best of my knowledge, to the water-pipe; she desired him to take the whip and beat her; then Mary Clifford was just let down; he took the whip, and gave her some very hard strokes, but did not continue beating her long.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she naked then?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had she been beating her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She had not been beating her long; I cannot say how long.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the condition of her body?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. After Mrs. Brownrigg had beat her, she had many cuts about her; when John came down she was very bad; there was blood.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you at this time?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I was in the kitchen all the time; John beat her with the whip on her naked body.</p>
               <p>Q. On what part did he more particular strike her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I believe he did not strike on any part particularly.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know any thing of a jack-chain?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I do;

               <p>Q. Was it done very tight?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I believe it was as tight as it could be round her neck, without choaking her.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was that put on before you were taken out of the house?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I believe it might be a month or six weeks before we were taken away.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it fastened?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. It was fastened by one ring being fixed in another.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot tell whether she could or no.</p>
               <p>Q. What was she fastened there for?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Because she was very dry in the night, and she got out, and broke some boards down; she was to scour the copper, and was chained to the yard-door all day, and loosed from the door on nights, just before dark, but sent down into the cellar with her hands tied behind her, with the chain on her neck.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she her clothes or waistcoat on?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot say whether she had or not; she was locked into the cellar under the stairs all night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who tied her hands?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I saw them after they were tied; my mistress tied them.</p>
               <p>Q. Who put the chain round her neck, and fastened her to the door?</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090007"/>M. Mitchel. I saw it put about her neck, but cannot tell by whom; there were my mistress, and the youngest son, and my master by, when it was put about her neck; to the best of my knowledge, it was my master's youngest son Billy, that called her up by my mistress's order. I heard her beat her; there was a brass chain, a squirrel chain, added to the iron chain, to make it longer.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you say your master saw the chain put on?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot, I am not certain, but he saw it on after it was on.</p>
               <p>Q. Which part of it was about her neck?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. It was the iron part.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your mistress by profession?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She is a midwife.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been out a little before you were taken away?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She had been in the country from the Saturday night till Sunday night; the next week, when she came home, she said nothing to us that night; on the Monday, the day following, she looked about the house, and said she could not find we had been doing any thing since she went out: she said she should give it us as soon as she had time, but she must go out then to see a gentlewoman she had laid; she was out till Friday, and came home in the evening.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Now we are come to Friday the 31st of July; what did your mistress do on that day? do you know in what state of health the child was in that whole week?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She was in a very pretty good state of health, only her head and shoulders were sore, they were scabbed over; there were very great scabs on each shoulder, and three or four on the head; them on the head were in a fair way to get well.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there scabs any where else?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I do not know that there were.</p>
               <p>Q. What clothes did she wear that week?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She wore her gown and petticoat that week.</p>
               <p>Q. How did she speak?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She could speak pretty well.</p>
               <p>Q. On that Friday morning what did Mrs. Brownrigg do?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. About ten in the morning, after she had done breakfast, she went down in the kitchen, and tied

No, not as I know of; my mistress did not charge her with any offence committed on that day, or the night before; my mistress told her she had not forgot her two or three times when she saw her at night; for two or three different nights, as she came home, she took and tied

               <p>Q. How many times did she strike her with the butt-end.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. To the best of my knowledge they were in the kitchen, but she was charged not to put them on; she has been charged not to put them on many times by my mistress, when I have not heard it.</p>
               <p>Q. What makes you say she was charged not to put them on if you did not hear it?</p>

               <p>Q. Had she her clothes on the next day?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She put them on on the Friday night, that is a gown and petticoat, and she had them on on Saturday; to the best of my memory she was not out till the Sunday in the afternoon.</p>

               <p>Q. Where were the family then?</p>

               <p>Q. How was the girl dressed?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. She then had a boy's waistcoat on till the afternoon; I do not recollect she had any thing on her head, that was very bad then; the waistcoat was put on when she was bad, to go in to clean the room before dinner; that was between breakfast and dinner; she went about the room naked before the waistcoat was put on; her shoulders were in a very raw condition.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. That was the Tuesday before the Friday.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she up-stairs before any body came to enquire for her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. That I cannot tell, my mistress had been boiling bread and water to put to

               <p>Q. What was the matter with her throat?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. It was very much swelled, and her head also; her throat was so swelled, that her chin and cheeks and all were quite even; it begun to swell on the Friday; my mistress began to put that poultice to it on the Monday night.</p>
               <p>Q. Who saw her in this condition?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. James my master did, and John his son was at home when they came to enquire for her, and so was my mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. How many doors is there to your master's house?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There is one that opens into Flower-de-luce court, and one into Fetter-lane, that was always double locked, and the key in the parlour; the street-door was never opened, unless somebody in particular came, so that I and

               <p>Q. Who used to lock it?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. That I cannot justly say; the other door my mistress or master or apprentice kept the key of when they happened to be at home.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any place open by which you could tell any body your complaint?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, the parlour and other rooms have lately been kept locked.</p>
               <p>Q. How long have they been kept locked?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot tell justly, they were all locked, except the two garrets; the bed-chambers were all kept locked, there was none but the best parlour made use of; that parlour towards Fetter-lane was never made use of.</p>
               <p>Q. Could you not at any time go through the parlour, and out into Flower-de-luce court?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No, there was always somebody in the shop or parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How often was you out of that house before you was taken out?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I have been to Islington with the family three or four times.</p>
               <p>Q. When was the last time?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. That was eleven months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not Mary Clifford sent out sometimes of errands?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I do not remember she ever was since she was bound apprentice, only she has been with the family at Islington, that is a good while ago; I think I was the last that was there of us two; I do not remember she was ever sent out of the house after she was bound.</p>
               <p>Q. Did not she cry when her mistress whipped her?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Yes, but my mistress used to say, the more we cried the more she would beat us, and we endeavoured to stop it, but we could not help crying; but

               <p>M. Mitchel. No, my master and mistress were at their lodgings at Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the cupboard-door was broke open?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. It was broke open to be sure, the nails were almost out; that was the time when my mistress set her to washing naked.</p>
               <p>Q. What had used to be in that cupboard?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There used to be bread and meat, and earthen plates, and such things.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your master ever lock the deceased in under the stairs?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Once I think he locked us in.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure of that?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I am, but I cannot justly say how long it is ago, it was on a Sunday.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. That I cannot say.</p>

               <p>M. Mitchel. We never fought. I have quarrelled with her when she has quarrelled with me, but we never fought.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you not believe your master carried the whip from the house to prevent your mistress making use of it upon you?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot tell that, he has come home and left it at the stable, and my mistress has sent the apprentice boy for it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you never complain to your master o your being tied up?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. Once I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What did he say to it?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. He said he was sorry, but I should mind my business; I complained that time when the whip was carried to the stable on the evening; the next morning my mistress wanted it; I had been beat, and was very sore.</p>

            . How long is it since the place was cleared of the coals, and tell the reason why it was cleared out?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I cannot justly say how long it may be ago, I believe it may be about eight months; we used to be in that hole since the coals were out.</p>
               <p>Q. from James. Was there nothing put into that place?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. There were some chips and shavings put in it about a month ago, but there were no chips and shavings in it when we were confined in it.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you never bid by your master and mistress, not to go to the coal-hole, fearing you should set fire to the shavings?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No.</p>
               <p>Q. from Elizabeth. Have I not sent down to you and the other girl, when you have been sitting with your clothes over your heads, to come up; and have I not beat you for lying there and neglecting your business?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. No. We have often chose to go up into the shop and grind the white lead, rather than stay in the coal hole; we never went there without we were sent there, and fastened in.</p>
               <p>Q. from James. Was you ever at Islington; and did you walk or ride there?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. I rode there once, behind my master's youngest son, when the other was sick there, and once I walked there.</p>
               <p>Q. from James. Do you remember riding in a coach there?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. We had lodgings in Frog-lane, and I went there in a coach once.</p>
               <p>Q. from Elizabeth. How long is it since you went with the other girl, to carry coals under your arm?</p>
               <p>M. Mitchel. That was a great while before any of this cruelty begun.</p>
               <p>Q. from James. Can you remember how long it is ago, since Mrs. Jones and her grand-daughter were at Islington, and you was there?</p>

               <p>Benham. In about two months after I was bound.</p>
               <p>Q. What did she beat her with?</p>
               <p>Benham. She beat her with the end of a horsewhip, or stick, or any thing that came in her hand as she ran by.</p>

               <p>Benham. No, I never did.</p>

               <p>Benham. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was she locked up alone?</p>
               <p>Benham. She was.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she her clothes on when you locked her up?</p>
               <p>Benham. No, she had no clothes on, only shoes and stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. How came she to be naked?</p>
               <p>Benham. I do not know.</p>

               <p>Q. Had she her clothes on then?</p>
               <p>Benham. She had.</p>
               <p>Q. When were they taken off, and upon what occasion?</p>
               <p>Benham. I do not know: she asked me to get her some clothes to cover her, and said, she knew where the clothes were. I bid her go and take them in with her: she took in some old pieces of blanket, a piece of an old rug, and such things to lie on, and cover her. I was opening the door for her to go in when she asked me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress give you any reason why this was done?</p>
               <p>Benham. No, she did not, that made my heart ach to lock her up so naked.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not ask your mistress why she did this?</p>
               <p>Benham. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen her so naked since?</p>
               <p>Benham. I never saw her so naked before or since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your mistress hit her with a whip or stick often?</p>
               <p>Benham. It may be once a week.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you look at her back when she was naked, to see if she had any wounds upon her?</p>
               <p>Benham. No, I turned my head away, and would not look at her.</p>
               <p>Q. Why so?</p>
               <p>Benham. I thought she might have some cuts by being beat, and my heart ached.</p>

               <p>Benham. I did, and put it into the top of a drawer in the shop.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he not mention a whip?</p>
               <p>Benham. He did not; he ordered me to burn all the sticks I could find. There was a piece of a rattan, a cane about a yard long, and a piece or two more of cane and the handle of a whip.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was the handle of a whip?</p>
               <p>Benham. That was about four inches long.</p>

               <p>Benham. No, no more than the sticks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know that when it was a whip?</p>
               <p>Benham. I did, but that was not the riding whip.</p>

               <p>Q. Where was the whip when your master went to the Compter?</p>
               <p>Benham. It was at the Bell inn, in Holbourn.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see a chain round Mary Clifford's neck.</p>
               <p>Benham. I do not recollect it was put round her neck; there was a chain; I saw her go into this coal-hole with a chain on.</p>
               <p>Q. How long ago is that?</p>

               <p>Q. Did she give you any reason why you was to tell her this?</p>
               <p>Benham. She said the girl's mother was a bad woman, and might teach bad things to her daughter; she had never come before, as I know of. I did not know whether

             in the house then?</p>
               <p>Benham. She was, I had seen her that morning standing on the foot of the stairs about nine o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What time of the day did the overseers come?</p>
               <p>Benham. About two or three in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. How was the girl dressed then?</p>
               <p>Benham. She had a light camblet-gown on.</p>
               <p>Q. In what condition was she?</p>
               <p>Benham. Her face was swelled, she had a cap on, and a handkerchief put all round her neck; I fancy she had on a poultice.</p>

               <p>Benham. Once or twice a week the sores used to run I believe.</p>
               <p>Q. For how many weeks?</p>
               <p>Benham. For the last fortnight I have seen it bloody many times.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Ten times?</p>
               <p>Benham. Yes.</p>
               <p>Council. Twenty?</p>
               <p>Benham. I am not sure.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you not seen her cap bloody before the last fortnight?</p>
               <p>Benham. I have.</p>

               <p>Benham. I was with him about a month or six weeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean two months after you was there or two months after you was bound, that you saw your mistress beat her?</p>
               <p>Benham. I mean two months after I was bound.</p>
               <p>Q. How many blows might she receive when she has been beat?</p>
               <p>Benham. Two or three blows.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you master James ever do any thing to her?</p>
               <p>Benham. I have heard him say to the girl, go along about your business, and push her along the parlour, when my mistress was going to beat her. My master met me once going home with the whip in my hand; my mistress had sent me for it; he asked me what I was going to do with it; I said, to take it home; he said, take it back with you, and go and dress the horse.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the camblet gown her usual dress?</p>

               <p>Q. Where did the other girl, Mary Mitchel lie?</p>
               <p>Benham. To the best of my knowledge, she used to lie in the parlour with my master and mistress.</p>
               <p>Q. When any body was at the door, who went to open it?</p>

               <p>Q. When was that?</p>
               <p>Benham. About a fortnight or three weeks before my master was taken up; it was on a Sunday in the afternoon; she walked to Islington.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did she stay there?</p>
               <p>Benham. I cannot recollect that; my master's youngest son and I followed her.</p>

               <p>Q. Was it the same cap, or different caps, that you saw bloody?</p>
               <p>Benham. Indeed I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. How was it, clean or dirty, when you first saw it?</p>
               <p>Benham. It was a clean cap.</p>
               <p>Q. At the latter end of your seeing it, what was it then?</p>
               <p>Benham. It was dirty.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it not appear as if it had been worn a fortnight?</p>
               <p>Benham. No, it did not.</p>
               <p>C. for Crown. Do you mean to be understood, that the cap was only bloody once, or do you mean you saw it bloody at different times?</p>
               <p>Benham. At different times.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean the same blood, or different bleedings?</p>

               <p>M. Clifford. The son John did, there was a good deal of trouble first; the officers said they would make him produce her, or they would make him suffer; then Mr. Brownrigg sent for a lawyer; he told the lawyer he was charged on suspicion of murder, that they had threatened to send him to the Compter, and when they were going to do it, he produced her.</p>
               <p>Q. What condition was she in?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. She was in a sad condition indeed, her face was swelled as big as two, her mouth was so swelled she could not shut it, and she was cut all under her throat, as if it had been with a cane, she could not speak; all her shoulders had sores all in one, she had two bits of rags upon them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see where they fetched the girl from?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. No, I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you mean by all in one?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. Her shoulders were all cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you imagine they were cut by?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. I suppose they were cut by whips or sticks, they had that appearance; her head was cut, she had a great many wounds upon it, and cuts all about her back and her legs; when I pulled her shoes and stockings off at the workhouse, I found her legs cut cross and cross, as if done with a thin end of a whip, and her back worse than her legs, and a very bad wound upon one of her hips.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they appear as if any care had been taken of them?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. No, they did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing applied to her throat?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. No, there was not.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. How often had you seen the husband before that time you went with the officers?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. I saw him but once before, and that might be a fortnight before.</p>
               <p>Q. What answer did he make you?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. I said I wanted to see the girl; he said she wanted for nothing, and she did not want to see me.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told him who you was?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. I had, I said I was her mother-in-law.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wounds appear to be fresh done?</p>
               <p>M. Clifford. Some seemed to be old, and some fresh done.</p>

               <p>Q. How do you know it was Mrs. Brownrigg?</p>
               <p>Clipson.

When Mr. Brownrigg was informed he should go to prison, and the coach was waiting at the door, he desired leave to go into his house to speak to two or three friends; I said he should not go without the constable; I told the constable, I should look upon him to see him forth coming; he went in with him, and in a little time after, the constable came out again, and said there were some creditable neighbours there, that would see him forth coming; then I told the constable, he might stay in the room where I was, which was between the shop and the stair-case; they staid there, I believe half an hour; then the door opened: I then asked if he was ready to go; then he said we might come into that room; he said he would agree to produce the girl, provided that would satisfy us; I told him we should be satisfied, provided he would produce the girl, and asked him how long he would be before he would produce her, because he had told us, she was at Stanstead in Hertfordshire, and had been there a fortnight; he brought out a bottle of red wine, and handed round a glass a piece for us to drink, and, I think, in about half an hour after he said he would produce her; she was led in by a tallish young man, about such another as the son at the bar, but I cannot swear it was he, not taking much notice of his person; I went up to the girl, and asked her how she did; she could not speak, her mouth was extended; she could not shut her lips, her face was very much swelled; I thought the best method I could do, was to take her away to the workhouse; there was a surgeon came; he said she was in very great danger.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in the room all the time till the child was produced?</p>
               <p>Elsdale, He was the greatest part of the time, if not all the time; he only went into another room for the bottle of wine.</p>

               <p>Coulson. No, I cannot, I did not know there was a maid-servant in the house; I have never been with his wife, I have been with him often; I have invited him to my house to spend an hour or two with me, but I never was at his house; I know nothing of his family business.</p>

            . I am an apothecary; I take care of the people in that workhouse; the deceased was brought in on the 4th of August; the girls were both in bed together.</p>
               <p>Counsel. Confine yourself to the deceased.</p>
               <p>Denbeigh. The top of her head and shoulders and back, appeared very bloody; I turned down the sheet, and found from the bottom of her feet to the top of her head almost one continued sore, scars that seemed as if cut with an instrument upon the body, legs, and thighs; upon one hip<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090018"/> was a very large wound; it spread about half the palm of my hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What kind of an instrument do you think they were made by?</p>
               <p>Denbeigh. That I cannot say, there was no dressing made use of; I was obliged to draw the shift from the wounds; her head was almost one continued fore, there were five or six wounds on her head.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was her hair?</p>
               <p>Denbeigh. I believe it was almost an inch or two long about the middle of her head; they might whip her from head to foot, but the repetition of that might occasion the wounds to be larger.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they like wounds that might be occasioned by a horse-whip, often repeated before the old ones were healed?</p>
               <p>Denbeigh. They might; I put four or five pledgets upon her, and took some blood from her; she had a fever upon her; her neck was swelled a great deal, to such a degree that she could not speak nor swallow; she was in a most shocking condition, I never saw such an object in my life; I dressed them both (that is the two girls) that night; when I came home, I told the gentleman that I lived with the case; it was requested they should be removed to the hospital, because we did not practise surgery. I got up the next morning, and told the officers of the parish, the sooner they were removed to the hospital the better; they were removed.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the wounds bleed;</p>
               <p>Denbeigh. They did; I was obliged to draw the shift from the wounds, which occasioned them to bleed.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young sworn.</p>
               <p>Mr. Young. I am surgeon to St. Bartholomew's hospital; the deceased was brought there the 5th of August, I saw her on the 6th.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account of what condition you saw her in.</p>
               <p>Young. I found upon her head six wounds, three of them very large, and three small; they appeared to be bruised wounds, such as might be given by the butt-end of a whip; her head and throat extremely swelled, she could not speak or swallow; from her head to her toes was wounded, in such a manner as was impossible to number them, but particularly upon her hip; the other wounds appeared to have been done by the lash of a whip, that is, from the head to the toes; and they appeared to be in a state of mortification from neglect.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you able to form a judgement of what these wounds were, whether of a few days before or from a former distance of time?</p>
               <p>Young. They did not appear to be given a great while before.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you call a great while?</p>
               <p>Young. That is three or four months; they seemed to be of no longer standing than about a week.</p>
               <p>Q. When did she die?</p>
               <p>Young. She died on Sunday the 9th.</p>
               <p>Q. What is your opinion was the cause of her death?</p>
               <p>Young. The wounds were the cause of her death.</p>
               <p>Q. To what do you impute the swelling on her neck?</p>
               <p>Young. There was on her neck a sort of ring as if something had been tied tight about her.</p>
               <p>Q. If a jack-chain had been fastened tight about her neck, might that occasion such a sort of a swelling?</p>
               <p>Young. It might; when I saw her on the Friday, the swelling on the head and neck did a good deal subside, and she was able to swallow; after that, she was in a high fever and delirium, and died.</p>
               <p>Q. Could she speak after the swelling was abated?</p>
               <p>Young. She spoke very inarticulately, and was in so much pain, we did not think proper to make her speak.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any thing said as to the present enquiry?</p>
               <p>Young. No, there was not.</p>

               <p>Here are several witnesses I can call, that have brought me word of the deceased girl's saying that I never beat her, nor suffered her to be beat. With regard to denying this girl, my dear partner for life, whom I have had sixteen children by, and the girl alive, they have always deceived me; I have been most bitterly deceived; they told me, the deceased was out of the house; my wife told me herself the girl was gone to Stanstead; the last time we were there, we agreed she should go there. I hope my attorney has got the examination that passed concerning me before the sitting Alderman: the woman that keeps the house where my lodgings were at Islington, can prove the girls used to go there by turns.</p>

I had them cried about Whitechapel parish; there came a person and told me she had heard Patt Robinson (a woman) was seen with a bundle of things in Prescot-street; I went with Mr. Brebrook to her, after that we had some reason to suspect the prisoners; that day fortnight Gibson and Tinsey were taken, they said they had sold them to a Jew before the Justices, the other was taken a week after the evidence; a Jew came and surrendered, we went and searched his apartment, but found nothing; nine days after that Mackaway was taken, he said he knew nothing of the breaking my place, but the other two met him with the bundle by Whitechapel-bars; he went with them, and Tinsey delivered this bundle to a girl, and then brought him to my place, and brought another bundle away; upon this he, the evidence, brought nine shirts, two pair of stockings, a towel, a white apron, and four sheets, they were part of the goods taken out of my wash-house; I met with a shirt also that was sold (as I was informed) for a shilling; I never recovered any more of my things.</p>

               <p>Q. What is your employ?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I do any work I can get to do; on Sunday the 2d of August, between nine and ten at night, I had been at a public-house, the Ship, for a pennyworth of tobacco; returning I was knocked down, and my handkerchief taken from my neck; there were more accomplices, but I can speak to none but the prisoner; they came behind me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any body before you was knocked down?</p>
               <p>C. Thompson. No, I did not; I received the blow on my cheek from behind me; the prisoner came behind me, and knocked me down.</p>
               <p>Q. How do you know she did it?</p>
               <p>C. Thompson. I saw her strike me, I was stunned with the blow.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>C. Thompson. I had seen her before several times, but had never spoke to her.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know where she lived?</p>
               <p>C. Thompson. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her name?</p>
               <p>C. Thompson. No, I did not; when I recovered myself, I had a great mob about me; I hallooed out I was robbed, Elizabeth Wall had robbed me.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say so at that time?</p>
               <p>C. Thompson. I did; I went home to bed, and she was taken the next day; I had sent to her twice in the morning, for her to send me my handkerchief, and I would forgive the abuse; but if she did not, I would swear a street robbery against her; and the answer I received was, that I might be d - d. After that, I heard she was gone for a warrant; then I thought it necessary to go for one. I went to the bench for one, and when I came home she was there, and acknowledged she had pawned it for half a crown in East-Smithfield.</p>

            . I am footman to Mr. Nobbs; I was on horseback; just as we came into the common field near Strawberry hill, a man on a bay horse came riding up; then he turned back, and met a man on a gray horse; they came up almost a broad side me, and followed us about 200 yards; then the man on the bay horse rode up to the coachman, and ordered him to stop; and the man on the gray horse came up to me, and demanded me to stop; then the first man turned his horse round to the ladies, and demanded their money; the moon was just getting up, it was dark; I cannot say any thing to either of the men; the man by me appeared to have his own hair, and I believe a surtout coat.

               <p>Mr. Higgins. I belong to General Elliot. On the 17th of August, I saw the prisoner and evidence, with two of our serjeants, at Kensington barracks, at the suttling house; Spooner pulled out half a Spanish dollar, and offered to sell it; (produced in court,) and he proposed to bring a<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090030"/> French crown in the morning, or forfeit a shilling.</p>
               <p>Q. to Mrs. Holland. Was your's a French crown?</p>
               <p>Mrs. Holland. No, mine was an English one.</p>
               <p>Higgins. I think Cooper paid the reckoning, and they went away. The man that offered 2 s. for the half dollar and I went to town together. I saw in the news paper two men described, answering the description of the prisoner and evidence, that had robbed a coach; they had told their names over night; we went and took them; I found this piece here produced upon Spooner. Cooper had 3 s. in money in his pocket; I asked which of them rode the gray horse; one of them replied I, but I cannot say which; they were taken before Sir

I lodged in New-street, Seven-Dials; we had some dinner and strong-beer; we went to bed; the next day, when we got up, now, said he, I told you I would be a friend to you, I will make you a present of this snuffer-stand, and gave it me; I said, God bless you, I am greatly obliged to you; I went and met a Jew in the street, we went under a gate-way, he had scales and weights, he gave me a crown an ounce for it, it came to thirty-two shillings, I paid away some of the money where I owed it.</p>

            , he looked at them; then I desired he would carry them up to Mr. Race the cashier.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you go up with him?</p>
               <p>Leach. No, I did not then.</p>
               <p>Q. How did they appear to you to have been filed?</p>
               <p>Leach. They appeared to me as if the right milling had been taken off, and then filed.</p>
               <p>Q. You say, when he paid some money, you observed he took some out of a bag in the drawer, is not that what is commonly done?</p>
               <p>Leach. That is very seldom done in the Bank, it is sometimes done; this was not the whole of the money, but part; it was mixed with the money upon the table; we put our guineas in one drawer, silver in another, moidores in another, ports in another.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with the three guineas?</p>
               <p>Leach. Mr. Race weighed them in my presence, they all three weighed fifteen pennyweights, nine grains; the weight should be sixteen pennyweights, four grains and a quarter.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the difference?</p>
               <p>Leach. Nineteen grains and a quarter, that is three shillings and a penny, according to the standard.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you weigh them separately?</p>
               <p>Leach. Yes, one of the guineas weighed five pennyweights, three grains, and nine-sixteenth, that was a guinea of the late King's; there were two of his present Majesty, one wants about ten-pence, the other about thirteen or fourteen-pence.</p>

            . I am one of the cashiers at the Bank.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you inform the court of the method of collecting the tellers bags?</p>
               <p>Thompson. The method is, every cashier, in his turn in waiting, takes the tellers bags, and locks them up in a particular place every night; every telle, has his name put to his bag, as they are all set down in a book.</p>
               <p>Q. Are the bags sealed?</p>
               <p>Thompson. No, they are not, the cashier in waiting that takes the bags, he finds so much money upon every bag, and we examine the book to see that they agree, that they make a balance, and then we lock them up, and they are delivered out the next morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any body besides yourselves as a check?</p>
               <p>Thompson. There are two locks upon the door of the cupboard where they are locked in; the cashier in waiting has one, and some one of the indoor tellers have the other key; the cashier cannot come at these bags without the teller; that indoor teller is one that is in waiting for the night, and we keep a check for them all.</p>
               <p>Q. Who are the waiting in-door tellers?</p>
               <p>Thompson. They take it by turns.</p>
               <p>Q. Who were in waiting that night, the 4th of July?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Kemp and Lucas were; the key is kept by one of them, I do not know which of them; I received orders from Mr. Race, the chief cashier, to inspect into Mr. Guest's bag of the 4th of July, and one or two of the tellers to be with me; Mr. Lucas and Mr. Kemp were present; the whole sum was 1800 l. 16 s. 6 d. in several bags; there were five hundred pound bags tied together, thirteen bags in all; I was ordered to see if there were any new guineas fresh filed; Mr. Kemp and Mr. Lucas told the money over; there was one bag in which was forty guineas, which seemed fresher than the others did, upon the outside.</p>
               <p>Q. When you speak of fresher, what part do you mean?</p>
               <p>Thompson. I mean the edges.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether you compared these to any of the other guineas in the other bags?</p>
               <p>Thompson. Yes, they were compared, and they all appeared fresher than the rest.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you closely inspect them?</p>
               <p>Thompson. We examined them with caution and deliberation.</p>
               <p>Q. Where have they been since?</p>
               <p>Thompson. They were sealed up by Mr. Kemp and myself, and have not been opened till this morning; they were kept locked up by the two<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090038"/> keys I have mentioned, by the cashier and the teller.</p>

               <p>Mr. Sewallis.

I am a servant in the Bank; I was present at a search made at Mr. Guest's house; I asked him, while he was at the Bank, for his keys of his book case and a cupboard; I told him I was going to search his house; this was on Monday the 6th of July; there were warrants out against him; he said he did not know what authority any body had to search his house, and refused to deliver his keys; I found all the things there; they were under seal till before the Grand Jury yesterday, and they are now under the seals of the Grand Jury; they were opened, and produced in court. (Note, They were such as were at and proper to effect or contribute to the commission of the particular offence with which he was charged in the indictment on which he was tried; and a bag with 100 guineas, and two bags of gold filings.)</p>
               <p>Humberton. We found these things under the flap of a small chest of drawers; there were three drawers on each side, and a drawer went quite cross at the bottom, about four inches deep; as it opened at the top, a flap before fell down, and there was a skin lay at the bottom, fastened to the back part, and a hole in the front part of it, to fasten to a button on his waistcoat, in the manner the jewellers use them; in that leather lay all the utensils, and the smallest parcel of gold dust loose, and another parcel in a paper by it; and another (the largest parcel) in a secret place under the leather, in a place about six or eight inches square, under the middle of the leather; we observed there was some yellow stuff on the teeth of the file.</p>
               <p>C. for prisoner. We do not controvert the finding these things.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the weight of the gold filings?</p>
               <p>Humberton. The weight is four pounds, eleven ounces, and nineteen pennyweights; that is the weight of all the filings together.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was in that that was concealed under the leather?</p>
               <p>Humberton.

            . I am a teller at the Bank; I think it was the latter end of March the prisoner had a bar of gold; it was, I believe, between five and six inches long, under two inches wide, and better than half an inch deep; I asked him how he came by it; he said he had it from Holland; I had it in my hand; I said I thought it was not like a regular bar of gold, it had a deal of copper on the back of it; he said it must be filed off, and that all bars of gold were so.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see bars of gold at the Bank before?</p>
               <p>Lee. I have, but never saw any with such scum on them as that had.</p>
               <p>Q. How often have you seen bars of gold?</p>
               <p>Lee. I have seen bars of gold scores of times before I went into the Bank.</p>

            . I am a jeweller; I have known the prisoner four years; I sold an ingot of gold for him the 12th of June last, there was about forty-eight ounces of it. I sold another ingot of gold for him about six months ago, that weighed forty-six ounces, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you get the price of standard gold for these ingots? </p>
               <p>Troughton. I got thereabouts.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination. </p>
               <p>Q. Have not you a great many ingots come from abroad?</p>
               <p>Troughton. We have, from different places.</p>
               <p>Q. Did this raise any suspicion in your mind at that? </p>
               <p>Troughton No, it did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it standard? </p>
               <p>Troughton. All gold ought to be standard, there is bad and good gold. </p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe any appearance of copper or filing?</p>
               <p>Troughton No, none at all; this appeared like other bars of gold that came from abroad; I understood it as such.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did they appear to be?</p>
               <p>Troughton. I took them to be about a foot long; there are various lengths of them; they come from abroad.</p>

               <p>E. Collins. Some little time before I came away, he used to be in the back parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How long before you came away?</p>
               <p>E. Collins. About a month before.</p>

               <p>E. Collins. A desk and half a dozen chairs?</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a desk?</p>
               <p>E. Collins. The same sort as other people's, a writing-desk; I saw it open one Sunday, when Mr. and Mrs. Guest went out a walking; he left his book-case open, I never saw the inside of it before; I went into the room to take his clothes away; the top being open, I looked into it: there I saw a glass cup with some yellow dust in it, and by the cup was a file, much like this that lies here.</p>

I am a pewterer in Fore-street, the prisoner brought two pewter plates to my shop on the 16th of July, between seven and eight in the morning; I seeing the names on them, asked the prisoner his name; he said it was Thomas Watts; he said he had had the plates two years, that he bought them of one Ewers, broker in Chiswell-street; there has been no broker there of that name some years; I sent one of my servants to the owners houses, then the prisoner begged I would let him go, saying, if he had stole them they were of no great consequence.</p>

            . The prisoner Davis was brought to my house; when he was brought to the Rotation Office, he said he would tell the whole truth; he said he and another lad went into a certain area between ten and eleven at night, and lay there till about one; the grandmother's birthday was then, and they were very merry, which he said made them lie longer; when all was still, they got over a place into the yard; he never said he went into the house, but the other lad went in, and gave him the things out at the window, and that the tea-spoons were sold to Mr. Julian by the woman at the bar; then I got a search-warrant, and we went to see for them; we found one spoon at the woman's sisters, and the other three at Mr. Julian's,</p>

            . I happened to be at Shepherd's-bush, where was a merry-making, on the 10th of August; the prisoner came by with two women, Mills was one of them; a man in company, said he would go and take one of the women from him; he went, and fetched one away; then we persuaded him to go and fetch the other; the other resented it, and fell to fighting; the prisoner pulled off his clothes to fight, and some spoons fell out of his pocket; he delivered the watch into the woman's hands that is at the bar; I said, here are a great many silver things, he ought to be examined how he came by them; so after he had washed himself, I said to him, you must give an account where you had these things: he said he could send for a person where he had them in ten minutes; I went to a necessary-house; he made through a little bit of a hedge, and got into a pond of water, up to about his middle; we ran after him, and in about three fields running, I saw him throw something away; we took and brought him back to the place where I first challenged him; then he went on his knees and begged for mercy, saying he was a young man, and had been guilty of a great fault; he begged I would let him go; I said, if I do, I shall be as bad as he; he said, if I would let him go, he would let me know where he had put the watch and three spoons; I went back to where I saw him cast away something; there I found only one silver knee-buckle. I heard him own before the Justice, where and how he got the things; I gave the knee-buckle to Mr. Whitebread the constable.</p>

            . I was going to Shepherd's bush with the prisoners; while we were there, we had a pot of groat beer; I paid 2 d. and the two prisoners 2 d. each; coming back, the people played the joke with us, and asked us if we would sit down; one of them pulled me down, and another went to fetch Mills back; I still continued sitting; I saw no spoons; after that, when Mills was in the Round-house, she sent for me, and desired me to take two table-spoons, and throw them away; I thought I would not throw them away, and I hid them: they were afterwards found, and then Mills owned she had given them to me; so I was taken up, and put in the Round-house next day.</p>

               <p>Lay. No, my halfpence were in my right-hand waistcoat pocket, and my gold in my left-hand breeches pocket; I heard her own to the watchman that carried her to New Prison, that the woman that went for the liquor had one guinea, and she the other; and if she did not help to maintain her in prison, she would inform against her and a good many more; she told the watchman he and part of many a crown got by picking of pockets, and what business had he to take her.</p>

               <p>Q. At what distance was you?</p>
               <p>S. Tyler. I was, I suppose, twenty or thirty yards from the child; I am no great judge of measurement; I screamed out; I cannot be positive what I said; I saw the wheel go over the child's head.</p>

               <p>S. Tyler.

            . I am a sawyer; I was sitting upon some timber about twenty yards from the child; I saw the cart coming along, and the child coming from the opposite corner towards me; the man endeavoured to turn his horses to the right, to shun a hole; the child passed the first horse, the second knocked it down with his knee, by the wheel pitching in the hole, and the near wheel went over its head; I had not power nor time to alarm the prisoner; he went away with his cart about 50 yards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he mend his pace?</p>
               <p>Haynes. His pace was rather mending; I am not quite clear whether the horses were in a trot; I called to him, he did not stop; I ran after, and stopped the horses, and desired him to get down, and asked him if he knew what he had done; he made me no answer; the child might have been saved, had not the second horse been out of the way.</p>
               <p>Q. Had he a whip?</p>
               <p>Haynes. No, not as I saw; he was delivered into the constable's custody, and I went to my work.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose the prisoner had been on the side of the horses as he ought to have been, could he not have stopped the horses?</p>

               <p>New. It was a female child; the prisoner wrung his hands, and said, how shall I face that infant in another world; if my life would pay for it, I would freely give it; it was a neighbour's child.</p>

Mr. Smith the constable came; I desired he would hold him till I went to see what I had lost, and I would come again; he was committed by Justice Miller; I went to see what I had lost; I found this bundle tied up behind the garret-door, a coat and waistcoat of mine, and a coat and waistcoat of my son in law's; mine were removed from a two pair of stairs room; there were several other things put together, but I do not lay them to his charge; when we were before the Justice, I found he had but just received his Majesty's pardon.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Griffiths. On the 13th of August, I was going up stairs, between seven and eight in the evening, to sweep them, I thought I heard a foot going before me; when I was upon the dining-room stairs, I took it to be the girl that belongs to the house; I called several times, and received no answer; I put the oil cloth into the dining-room; after that, I heard a foot go up again; I called again, but no answer; I heard as if it was the rushing of some person going before me; then I ran up stairs within four steps of my own room; I saw my room-door shut too softly, and saw somebody move; I went into the next room to a young man that lay not well; I asked him if he heard Patty go up stairs; he said the cat was there, and desired I would go and turn her down stairs; then I went into my room, and called, but received no answer; I said if she was got under the bed, I would go and fetch her out; (this was upon the dusk of the evening:) I went into the room joining my room, beyond mine, and looked down upon the floor, and there I saw both the legs of a man, out from under the bed; I observed he had brown clothes on; I stood still two or three minutes, and thought it was somebody get into the house, to conceal himself in order to rob the house: I went out of the room, and said to John, my God, John, somebody is got into the house, and under the bed, with intent to rob the house; I ran down and rang the bell; when I got to the bottom, I called the nurse to run and fetch somebody for a rogue was in the house, and got under a bed; I never quitted the stairs till the person came down; I heard him from the two pair of stairs come padding down; when he came to the bottom, he made an attempt to go out at the street-door directly; I went up to him, and asked him who he wanted; he, in a great agitation, said he wanted one Captain Johnson.</p>
               <p>Q. Whereabouts was he when you spoke to him?</p>
               <p>J. Ironmonger. He was at the bottom of the stairs; I told him, there was no Captain Johnson lodged in the house, and said, who let you in, you villain, you want to rob the house; he turned round, and ran out as fast as he could, and shut the door too after him; I thought he kept the door fast that I should not come after him; I ran out at the other door, and called stop thief; I saw him running down the street; (it was the prisoner at the bar;) my master came in, and went up and found the bundle.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the person you saw in the garret?</p>
               <p>J. Ironmonger. I am sure he is; I did not see his face, but I knew him by his clothes; there was no other person running in the street but him till I began to halloo out, stop thief; I insisted upon his not being discharged before Mr. Miller.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you told Mr. Miller that a bundle was found?</p>
               <p>J. Ironmonger. I believe I did.</p>

            . I was Justice Miller's servant; I saw the prisoner about ten minutes before he was taken; there was a poor woman playing on music near my master's door, and he gave the poor woman a penny; the woman had two children; this was near Mr. Miller's.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Mr. Miller's from Mr. Griffith's house?</p>
               <p>E. Wheeler. It is a good considerable way distance; he lives in the Broad Sanctuary near the chapel.</p>

               <p>E. Wheeler. He was dressed in a brown suit of clothes, turned up with red.</p>
               <p>Q. How came you to remark him so particularly?</p>
               <p>E. Wheeler. Because he gave the poor woman a penny; the Sunday after, I had some conversation with Mr. Griffith's maid; she told me she never saw him till she saw him at the door; she said there were two fellows rushed out, and she could not swear she saw him in the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you any connections with this man at the bar?</p>
               <p>E. Wheeler. No; I never saw him in my life, till I saw him give the woman a penny at the door; the maid said her master insisted upon her swearing to this man.</p>

               <p>H. Burch. She is eight years of age; a surgeon examined her on Tuesday the 11th; I told my brother of it the day I examined her; we took the prisoner before my Lord-Mayor; the child was asked why she could let the boy serve her so, and not cry out; she said she did cry out, and he stopped her mouth, and said, if ever she told of it, he would whip her till the blood run at her heels; this was on the 10th; the prisoner was by at the time, he denied it.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the parts appear when you examined her?</p>
               <p>H. Burch. They appeared swelled, and to be torn; there was a great running; I observed it very much on her linen.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see any blood?</p>
               <p>H. Burch. No, I did not, she kept it from me, she said because the prisoner had promised to give her some halfpence to buy some doll's clothes.</p>

I am father to the child; I first heard of this on Saturday the 8th, from my sister; I did not examine the child then; the child and I lay together that night; I examined her in the morning very closely; I found her linen and the sheet in a very bad condition; I looked upon it that somebody had been concerned with the child; I spoke to her in a very soft mild manner; I said, child, somebody has been doing you an injury, do not be frighted, tell me the truth, and you may depend upon it I shall not do you any harm; she said the prisoner threw her down upon the bed, and said, Polly, my dear, if you will let me put my d - le into your c - y, I will give you all the money I can get to buy you some cherries; she said he lay upon her a considerable time, and hurt her very much, and she tried to cry out, but he stopped her mouth with both his hands, so that she could hardly fetch her breath, and afterwards if she told, he threatened he would whip her till the blood ran down her heels. On the Monday the surgeon was going by the door, I called him in, and told him the child said she had been injured by my apprentice; he examined her, and he is here to give the court an account of what he observed. I took the prisoner up, and took him before my Lord-Mayor, and they were separately examined.</p>

               <p>A. Brand.

            .</p>
               <p>I Am a surgeon; I examined the child on Monday the 10th of August, as near as I can recollect between three and four in the afternoon; I found her much lacerated and torn; she was in a very deplorable condition, and could hardly stir about without crying out; it appeared to me beyond a doubt she had been injured, but I could not determine by who.</p>
               <p>Q. How injured?</p>
               <p>Toleman. I believe she had been penetrated, and carnally known; I examined her as strictly as possible in the presence of her aunt; I have reason to believe there was some venereal taint.</p>
               <p>Q. From what do you form your judgment?</p>
               <p>Toleman. We judge from the discharge frequently; I believe it certainly was so; I treated it as venereal; the child has been under a slight course of salivation for ten days.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner examined as to that?</p>
               <p>Toleman. He was, after he was at the Poultry Compter; I myself examined him; he had a little of it, but I have reason, from some circumstances, to believe he had been so lately, and was so at the time of the injury given.</p>
               <p>Q. How long after the time he was taken up was it you examined him?</p>
               <p>Toleman. I believe it was six or eight days after he had been before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. By what circumstances do you judge?</p>
               <p>Toleman. There was a number of ugly livid blotches about him, many upon his legs, some on his arms, and upon different parts of his body.</p>
               <p>Q. What other circumstance?</p>
               <p>Toleman. I not only was convinced by this, but it appeared there had been a running a few days before from what I saw, because the inflammation had not already subsided from the corrosive discharge.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you venture to say, from these appearances, with certainty, that this lad had had the venereal taint?</p>
               <p>Toleman. I think I can venture to affirm it for a certainty; and, in my judgment, I do believe the child had been penetrated.</p>
               <p>The child examined, but not upon oath.</p>
               <p>Q. How old are you?</p>

               <p>M. Brand. Yes, a running, Sir.</p>

               <p>M. Brand. When I made water.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon was that after you was hurt?</p>
               <p>M. Brand. I believe it was the next day.</p>

               <p>M. Brand. He stopped my mouth with his hand.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I protest I never had the venereal disease in my life, these blotches were occasioned by the itch.</p>
               <p>Q. to Toleman. Could the blotches be the effect of the itch?</p>
               <p>Toleman. The blotches occasioned by the itch are not like these, there is a material difference.</p>
               <p>Q. Could that of a running have happened in consequence of so recent an injury given but the day before?</p>
               <p>Toleman. The discharge of a recent injury, is very different in colour from that of a longer time; the shift was as if it had been dipped in something of the buckram kind; I have seen some others very bad, but I never saw any so lacerated as this child.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I am innocent as the child unborn; the father has instilled these notions into the child's head; he stood behind her, before my Lord-Mayor, and told her what to say: there are other lads that resort there besides me; the mother of the child packed up the bed; I took and carried it over, and threw it down in the shop; my master came over, and desired me to make haste; the child was not there when I carried it up.</p>

I got a light; the prisoner was gone out; a little time after she came again with two other cheeses; I demanded to know of her where she had them; she said, indeed I came honestly by them, Mr. Williams gave them me, and desired me to say nothing; Williams is a porter at the prosecutor's shop; I said, I will see him; she took up three of them; I overtook her at the end of the alley, and gave her the other; she dropped one of them; I took it up, and gave it her; she went and crossed to Mr. Briscal's shop; the watchman was near, he saw her strive to unlock Mr. Briscal's door; then the constable and I went over to her; we knocked Mr. Briscal's maid up; after that he came down, and she was sent to the Compter.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I have known him nine years; they put me to prison because I would not tell who I had them of.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not tell?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. Because people told me they could not hurt me, as I had served seven years to the trade; and if I did not tell, they could go no farther; I did not tell for about a day and a half, then I informed Mr. Scott.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it not a common thing in the watch trade to change the name and number, in order to palm bad watches for good ones?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. Sometimes it has been done.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there not an Ellicot or a Graham on some that are not of much value?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I believe there may.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there not thousands of watches come from Jamaica with names put upon them here?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. There may.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you not at first say you had them of one Jones?</p>
               <p>Burroughs. I did, that was by the prisoner's order; he said, if I said I had them of one Jones, they would not find it out who the person was I had them of.</p>

               <p>Burroughs. These watches in my book the prisoner brought to me, to alter the names.</p>

               <p>Burroughs. I lived in Allen street, and when I lived at the corner of Ball yard, my landlord can make it appear he has seen the prisoner come to me several times, and my wife can prove the same.</p>

            . I had a little business with Mr. Simpson; while I was there, Mr. Holythorne came in with a few bindings; Mr. Simpson scrupled them; he said he was the real maker, and was forced to cut them out of the loom for ready money; I bought a piece of Mr. Simpson.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Holythorne declared before my Lord Mayor, he had these goods of Mrs. Jones; he said he had had but a very little profit in the selling them; that he sold them for Mrs. Jones, and kept something for his trouble; after that, I was told by the keeper of the Compter, if I would go to Mrs. Jones, she would tell me all; I went to her; she told me she had stole these goods out of my warehouse as often as she could, at four or five pieces at a time, when my men's backs were turned, and that she had a pocket for that purpose; and by Holythorne's and her account, I suppose; I have lost an hundred pieces; Holythorne owned he had sold six pieces to a chandler's shop in the Land of Promise</p>

               <p>When they took me they found nothing upon me; when I was in the Compter, he said if I would confess the truth, he would leave me to God and the mercy of the Jury; I told him I sold sixteen pieces to Holythorne, and never saw a halfpenny piece for them.</p>

I am a surgeon, I was called to open the deceased; I found every thing quite perfect in the head; in the body I found a large quantity of extravasated blood in the abdomen, a blood-vessel had burst, which I look upon to be the occasion of his death; I took out between two and three quarts, and left a great deal behind; this might happen from a fall or twist; there were no marks of violence upon the body.</p>

               <p>Caesar Augustus West. I am a carpenter, I work for Mr. Atterbury; I have seen the prisoner come into his yard the latter end of August, in our dinner hours, he had no business there; I desired him to go out; he said, as I was a stranger to him he would go out; but before that, there was a great deal of stuff missing out of the yard; I was informed there was a new partition put up at the house of Mrs. Anson, about four doors from my master's yard; I went and looked at it, and found it was some of my master's stuff; there was a part of the sash-door left in the yard; I knew them to be my master's property.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know who put them up?</p>
               <p>West. No, I do not.</p>
               <p>Mr. Steed. I am a servant to Mr. Atterbury; I was employed to take care of this stuff; I put it up in a lost, to be kept to be used again; when it was missing, I made enquiry in the neighbourhood, and found the prisoner had done a job for half a guinea, which my master would not have done for 50 s.</p>

I said 2 s. 6 d. if I sell them; he bid me 2 s. 2 d. and walked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090073"/> out of the shop; I had no body but myself in the shop; I ran out at the door, and brought him back again, and held him with his breast against the counter, and said, you rogue, you have robbed me, turn your pockets; there came in a neighbour from across the way; he called our servants out of the work shop; in the mean time the prisoner discharged all the buttons out of his right-hand pocket as I held him; there was one button found upon searching him, in his pocket, and a cluster ring, and 1 s. 8 1/2 d. in money upon him; that ring was not our property; the other buttons and studs were found by the side of the counter, where I held him upon the ground.</p>

            , a refiner; the prisoner was employed there in clearing some test after we had refined, to sift the waste.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the test? </p>
               <p>Cox. That is made of bone ashes, to refine silver on; he was employed to clean the mold out, that is, to take the silver out that runs into the cracks.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you miss any silver?</p>
               <p>Cox. It is impossible for me to swear to that; we refine two hundred weight of metal at a time; about the 29th of July, Mr. Salmon's apprentice came and told me, one of our men had offered some metal at his house; I went there, and Mr. Salmon and I went to a public-house, where I was told the prisoner was; he was gone out in order to go off; I ran after him, and brought him back to Mr. Salmon's shop; I had seen some partings; I asked the prisoner how he came by it.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Cox. There was about four or five ounces; it was a mixture of gold and silver, which we had been refining, in order to get the gold from the silver; it was different sweeps and gold lace; the prisoner told me he had found it in Barbican; in taking him home, he begged I would take no notice of it to our people, and desired I would take him into a public-house, and he would tell the truth; I said I could not, without the consent of Mr. Cox's brother, and another that was there; I took him to the Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner been cleaning any tests about that time?</p>
               <p>Cox. He cleaned several tests that day, and there might be such partings as these taken out of them; (produced in court.)</p>
               <p>Mr. Salmon. I live in Barbican, and am a silversmith; the prisoner came to my shop the 29th of July, and offered these silver partings for sale; he seemed to be ignorant as to the value of them; I looked at it, and looked at him, and asked him where he had them; said he, I found them in Barbican, between two posts; I said, I am afraid not, it looks as if they had been stolen from somebody; he said he would assure me he had found it, and that a man knows very well, and called him from over the way, that was Mr. Brooks; when he came, he said he knew but little of the prisoner; I asked the prisoner who and what he was; he said he knew what silver was as well as I did; I said, pray who do you live with; said he, I have lived with Mr. Cox; I called my apprentice, and sent him to Mr. Cox's; house, and sent the prisoner's name, and desired Mr. Cox would come; the prisoner desired to know if he might go and have a pint of beer; I said he might, if Mr. Brooks went with him; I desired Mr. Brooks not to let him slip away; when Mr. Cox came, we went to the alehouse, and to my great surprize<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090074"/> I saw the prisoner going away at the bottom of Paul's-alley.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he run or walk?</p>
               <p>Salmon. He walked.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I carried it to Mr. Salmon to be tried.</p>
               <p>Salmon. He brought it to me to sell, and would have sold it if I would have bought it.</p>
               <p>Mr. Brooks. I am a watch-case maker; the prisoner called to me, and said Mr. Watkins, I hope no offence; I worked with Mr. Cox when you had your sweep done; I wish I had seen you sooner, I have found something, and you may be a judge, I think it is something like lead, I have given it here to be tried; I went into Mr. Salmon's shop, who then had it looking at; I looked at it, and said I believed it was silver, and very good silver; Mr. Salmon asked how the prisoner came by it; the prisoner said he found it, and said he lived with Mr. Cox the refiner, and that his name was Warner; then Mr. Salmon sent for his master; then the prisoner and I went to a public-house; he went out, and came in again, and said, Mr. Watkins, stand my friend here; I said, what can I stand your friend in; said he, you must say you saw me find it; said I, you must take me to be a very bad sort of a man; after that, he said if you will you shall have half; then said I, your master will be here by and by, and you must give him a just account; he seemed to be very much nettled, and after we had this talk, he said he wanted to make water; he went to the door; I said to the waiter, stand by him, if he offers to stir, come and tell me; the waiter soon came and said, Sir, he is going; Mr. Cox came just at the time, he ran and brought him back.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I was in liquor, and do not know whether I ran or walked, or did go away at all; I had left Mr. Cox's work some few days; I picked this up as I was walking in Barbican; I then went to a friend's house, and staid there some time, there was a stranger; I said I had picked up something, and should be glad to know what it was; when I came into Mr. Salmon's shop, I desired his wife to try it for me; by and by he came, and brought it in his hand; he had broke it into several pieces, it looked more like lead than silver; I told him where I lived, and my name; said he, I shall detain you, and send for Mr. Cox; said I, with all my heart; I had worked for Mr. Cox about three months, and was never at work by myself.</p>
               <p>To his character.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Alderman Plumb. On Monday the 20th of July, in the afternoon, the prisoner came to our house to enquire the price of gold and silver; I said it was not a rule in the house to set any value upon silver, there are so many sorts of it; he pretended his sisters that lived at Woodford had had an accident in melting some silver lace, and on the Tuesday morning he brought it, in order to have the value of it, the same as is here produced; it appeared a little suspicious, I desired him to leave it; he did not come again for three or four days; an experiment was made on it, and gold was found in it which made it plain it was not silver lace. On the Saturday morning he came again, in order to have the money upon it, that he might buy goods, which he said must go down to his sister at Woodford. We did not chuse to let him have any money, till we saw his sister; then he said he must go down to his sister, to come up and prove it was her property. On the Monday a woman came, which pretended she was his sister; there could be no answer given her that night, the compting-house being shut up. On the Tuesday<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="176709090075"/> morning a woman came again, and said, she lived beyond Woodford, and pretended it was her property; I suspected it was not; she went away, and on the Wednesday morning it all came out; if the woman is here, and can prove it her property, there is an end of it.</p>

               <p>It is my wife's property, she has dealt in lace going on eighteen years; I bought a great deal last year; this she burned herself; she put it into an earthen pot, and had the misfortune to run it down; I worked at Mr. Cox's, I came home, and saw it on the fire; my wife was not in the way; I took and put in some odd buttons and things to melt with it; I call my wife my sister.</p>
