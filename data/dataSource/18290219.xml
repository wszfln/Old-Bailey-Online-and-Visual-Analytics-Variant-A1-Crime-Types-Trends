On the 9th of February, about twelve o'clock, the prisoner Cass came to my house, and remained there till nine at night - he sat in the tap-room till about half-past eight, and then went down stairs into the kitchen, where the brandy is kept; he had been in the habit of sitting in my tap-room for the last fortnight, being out of employ - I sent the boy down after him; he came up about nine o'clock, and told me something - I immediately went down stairs, and found the door open; it opens into a court, which leads into the street - I missed a cask, containing five gallons and a half of brandy: I found Cass next morning, at half-past seven o'clock, at the Flask public-house, in Ebury-street, Chelsea, sitting by the tap-room fire - Sullivan, the officer, was with me: in my absence a pot was sent for - my boy went with it; he came back, and in consequence of what he said, I immediately went down into the field by Lord Grosvenor's canal, and found the cask and brandy; Cantwell had got it on his knee, and Flinn was pouring it out - several people were round them; I took hold of the brandy, and said, "I can swear this is my property;" Cantwell said if it was mine they would have nothing more to do with it - I sent my boy for an officer, who took the brandy and Flinn to the watch-house, which is about an eighth of a mile off, we then came back and took Cantwell; he had remained there till we came back, and was not in custody at all.</p>
               <p>Q. When they first saw you coming to them, was there any thing done to the brandy? A. They were in the act of pouring it out - I staid there with it till the officer came; it was covered up with two coats before I got there: I had never seen Flinn or Cantwell at my house - the field was about an eighth of a mile from my house; the door below stairs was always kept locked, but the key was kept inside - any body within could open it and go out.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you been out of your house the day the brandy was taken? A. No, except just outside the door; I do not think above four or five persons had been to the house all day - only Cass was there in the evening: the side-door opens to a private back yard, where there is a privy, but there is another for the customers; I locked the door twice that afternoon, as I had been into the yard to look at some cottages; the pot and glass was borrowed of my house-keeper- I might have called her my wife before the Magistrate, but I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long was it before you returned and took Cantwell? A. In about ten minutes; he had seen the officer take Flinn away - about a gallon and a half of the brandy was gone; eight or ten persons were round - I gave 29s. 6d. a gallon for it.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Odwell. On the 9th of February I saw the prisoner Cass at our house, about twelve o'clock - he staid till about nine at night, in the tap-room; about half-past eight o'clock, I saw him down in the passage; master sent me down to look for him - I had seen him go down stairs to the place where the privy was, about twenty minutes or half an hour before; I found him in the privy, and asked what he did there - he did not say any thing; I went up stairs, and he came up again to the tap-room, stopped there about half anhour, and then went down again; I went down about twenty minutes or half an hour after, and found the back door open, and Cass was gone (when I went down the first time it was locked;) I came up, and told master the door was open - he came down, looked about, and missed the brandy; he then went out - I went out, and looked about, but found nothing; I was sent out next morning, about seven o'clock, to watch, after the pot was borrowed, and saw the cask of brandy covered over (a person lives at the house as mistress;) I had seen the brandy safe that evening - nobody lives in the lower part of the house: I know Cantwell - I had not seen either him or Flinn near master's house that day.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Where was the brandy kept? A. In the kitchen - the servant works there sometimes, but the victuals is not cooked there; I had not seen Cass drink any thing that day - I know nothing of his being sick; it is not a house of much <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190004"/>business. When I saw the brandy by the canal, Cantwell was with it, but not Cass.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Had the customers any business in the kitchen? A. No - the servant is generally in the bar.</p>

At twenty minutes to nine o'clock I went out at the front door; I was down in the privy four or five times, and between twelve and one the boy came and threw some water into my face in the privy; there were twelve or fourteen navigators in the house - he lets the people out at the side-door on Sundays.</p>

The prisoner lived in our service twice; she lived there eight or nine weeks the first time - we let our house, and took her back to accommodate the persons who succeeded us; she was with us six weeks, on the 5th of February, when this happened - the bar is a small room adjoining the parlour; there is nothing but a partition and a small door between them - we have a locker fixed to the wall in the corner of the bar - it has no lock to it; we keep money in it: on the 5th of February she brought five tea-spoons to the bar after tea - I had desired her to bring them into the bar-parlour, and place them on a small chest of drawers; I saw her come into the bar-parlour, but she never would put them there if I was there, but place them in the bar- she must go through the bar-parlour to get to the bar; I saw her go into the bar with the spoons - I was sitting in the bar-parlour with my husband and a little boy, about five years old; she passed through the parlour to go to the bar, and I distinctly heard the lid of the wooden locker fall as if let down - my husband asked me if I heard it; I told him to hold his tongue - she left the bar in about two minutes, and went through the parlour to the kitchen; I had examined the locker, and tied thirty-two sovereigns up in a bit of linen rag just before, and a 10l. Bank of England note - I tied them up together about a quarter past five o'clock, and left them safe in a purse in the locker; she went into the bar a few minutes after six with the spoons - nobody but myself had been in the bar in the intermediate time; they could not go without my seeing them, as they must go through the bar-parlour; there is another door, but it was fastened - she came through the parlour and across the passage into the kitchen, which is on the same floor; I immediately went to the locker before she could get to the kitchen, and observed a bag of silver there as I had left it, but the gold and note were gone - they were in a small purse; I immediately took my candle and went into the kitchen after her, and immediately she saw me she put her light out; I asked her to give me the purse which she had taken from the bar - her answer was "The devil a bit of purse have I got;" I told her she had got it in her bosom, for I saw it there - I saw part of it; I did not tell her I saw it, but told her she had it in her bosom - I asked her to give it me; she put her hand to her bosom, and I saw her move it from the front of her bosom, under her left arm; she then felt in her pocket, and took out some trifling things - I then told her she must go up stairs with me; she did not answer, but rushed behind me, and went back to the bar-parlour - I endeavoured to follow her, but she shut the door against me; she partly closed the door, and lay down against it to prevent my coming in -I could open it a little, and saw she was lying behind the door, but could not see what she was doing; I could only see her feet, and hear she was doing something; she kept there about two minutes, and then let me into the room; she got up and went up stairs with me - I asked her to take her clothes off - she took them off very deliberately, but I found no purse on her; she had five half-crowns and some shillings in her pocket, but I do not know whether I missed any silver that day - the silver bag had been turned on one side: I am certain no silver had been taken out of the bag that night, for I marked it- while I was up stairs with her, my husband went for an officer; Lee came in about half an hour - I expected she would give me the purse; the officers asked what she had done with it; I told them in her presence, I supposed she would give it me soon, but she denied knowing any thing of it; she continued to deny it - the officers and I searched in the kitchen where she had been standing, but found nothing; we went back to the bar-parlour - took her into custody, and the officers told me to search the parlour where she had been: I searched afterwards at the end of the chest of drawers which the door opens against - I saw some umbrellas had been pulled out from the end of the drawers, and in that space I found the purse with all the money in it, and my rag as I had left it; she had just gone out of the door in custody when I found it - the officer took the money to Hatton-garden; I myself did not take it up - I called<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190005"/>the officer to do it; it was opened in my presence - I found thirty-two sovereigns and a 10l. note in it; I know the note by the name of Weed on it, who I had received it from - I put his name on it myself, and I knew the linen rag.</p>

I was in the room with my wife, and saw the prisoner go through into the bar; I desired her to leave the spoons on the drawers in the parlour, but she took no notice, and went into the bar with them - she did not shut the bar-door; I could not see the locker, but I heard the flap go down, and nobody was there but her - nobody could go into the bar without my observing them; I swear nobody else went in - we had been sitting there some time - I know the Bank-note.</p>

I used to take the spoons every morning and evening - I put them down with the tea-pot, and come out through the room they sat in: the child had some iron things and nails in a basket - I began to talk to the child; I always used to put out the candle before I came out of the kitchen, because she said it smelt so; she called me out of the kitchen and searched my bosom and pocket - I came into the room again to pick up the nails the child had taken out of the basket; she then called me up stairs and told me to strip; I did so, but she found nothing; I went into the tap-room and stopped till the officer came - he found nothing but my wages.</p>
               <p>MRS. EFFLAND. I had not been out of the parlour after I made the money safe; nobody could have gone to the bar without my seeing them.</p>

On Monday night, the 8th of December, I left my doors all barred and bolted, and the windows secure; I have nobody but an apprentice in the house: I went to bed about twelve o'clock, got up about half-past six, and found the front door unlocked and unbolted - no violence had been used to that door; the key was left on the counter in the shop- I had left it in the door: my house was formerly a butcher's, and there is a slaughter-house at the back, from which there is a door and window looking into the shop - they first broke open the slaughter-house door, and had entered into the back parlour, through the slaughter-house window; a pane of glass was taken out of the window - they could then open the window, get<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190006"/>in and unbolt the shop-door; I missed a quantity of bristles, and about four or five dozen brushes - they were worth about 25l.; they were all safe the night before. -On the evening after the robbery two men called and asked me to come out, as they had something to communicate; I went out, and in consequence of what they said I went to the Police-office, and told what I had heard - an officer was sent with me and the two men; we went to a house in Charlotte-street, Curtain-road, where the prisoner lived - we saw him there, and found a basket of bristles on a table in a corner of the room; I identified them as part of my property - I knew some by the tie, and some by a process I had brought them through; the officer asked the prisoner how he came by them - he said two men called and left them there, and that he expected the price of a drink for allowing them to do so; the officer told him to say nothing to criminate himself, as what he said would be given in evidence against him - he then said two men called, and left them there; when we came to the office the other two men followed me for some money, for the information they had given - the prisoner was in the watch-house at that time; I had promised to reward them with 2l or 3l. if I obtained my property - I gave them into custody, and they were let out on bail; there names were Smith and Fletcher.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you learn from either of the men any thing about one Nathan? A. No, but he was in custody, and discharged on bail; I have not indicted him - the prisoner did not mention Nathan's name: the bristles laid on his table, in a clothes basket, covered with a black handkerchief; we found more in the room: I told the officer I suspected a man who lived behind my house, as he was in the trade, and the best bristles were selected - I have seen that man once or twice since; the prisoner described the two men to me, and I think they answered the description of the men who gave the information - they were in the crowd at the office, and the officer said, "Do you not know either of these two men;" he said he knew one, but he was not the man who brought the bristles.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. The men pointed out the house to you? A. Yes, and then they ran away; the prisoner did not see them then - when I came back I found them standing in an entry near his premises; I could not find the house after I had been for a coach, and they pointed it out to me; I have no reason to believe the prisoner knew I had received information from two men - I might have told him so, but I am not certain about it.</p>

            . I am an officer. On Tuesday, the 9th of December, about ten o'clock at night, Rooney took me, with the two persons who gave the information, to the prisoner's house, No. 25. Charlotte-street, Curtain-road; the men pointed out the door, and immediately ran away - I went in: I knew nothing of the two men before - the door opens into the lower room; the moment we got in Rooney went to a dresser, and saw some bristles, which be claimed - I then said I must take him to the office, and told him not to criminate himself; he then told me two young men had brought the bristles there about six o'clock, and that he, being very poor, wished to earn a shilling or two, and had allowed them to leave them there, and that they were to be called for that night or early the next morning; he gave me no description of them - I took him to the watch-house, and went to the office; when I came outside, observing the two young men had been following the coach to the watch-house and to the office, I secured them, having suspicion of them; there were eight examinations - they were remanded there or four weeks, and then ordered to find bail; they did not find bail, and were discharged last Session, by proclamation. On the following morning, as I was bringing the prisoner from Norton-falgate watch-house, he said, "Now I will tell you the truth, a man named Nathan came to me, and asked me if I would earn a shilling - I said Yes; he then desired me to bring my basket out of the house, which I did, and then Nathan left me, desiring me to follow two men who were waiting outside the house;" next morning he identified one of the two men as one of them - he picked him out from forty persons; that was Smith: he did not point out the other man, but denied knowing him - he said he followed them to a house in a street near Rosemary-lane, that one of them then took the basket from him, went in, and brought it out, with something in it, and desired him to carry it back near his house - he said he waited at the door while one or both of them went in (Rooney does not live near Rosemary-lane); he said when they got to his house they told him they could not get any money, but if he would let them have the basket they would return in a few minutes, and pay him - that they returned in a short time, and begged they might leave the basket there, and they would call and pay him that night or next morning.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Have you inquired about the prisoner's character? A. I believe him to be very poor; I never knew a charge against him - this trial was postponed last Session, because his sister was in the family way; I never heard him say she had slept in the same room with him on the night of the robbery - I understand Nathan is a queer character: the prisoner is a pieman - I do not suppose he understands about bristles.(Property produced and sworn to.)</p>

            . I am the prisoner's sister, and lived with him in December; only he and his wife live there- we all slept in the same room: I could not come here last Session, as I was brought to bed six weeks ago. On the night of the 8th of December my brother went to bed about ten o'clock, and got up about seven next morning - my bed was by the side of his; he was out of employ. On the day he was apprehended I saw Nathan come to the house between five and six o'clock in the evening, ask my brother to go some where in Rosemary-lane, and fetch some things for him; he said Yes, if they were not too heavy - he went out with an empty basket, and asked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190007"/>Nathan to go and shew him where; Nathan said two young men were waiting outside to go with him - my brother returned alone in about an hour and a half, without his basket, and said, "Nathan says he will bring the basket in half an hour, and pay me 2s." - Nathan returned in about an hour and a half, with the basket, and asked my brother to let it be there till the morning, when he would call and pay him. I am quite sure he slept at home on Monday, the 8th.</p>

George and John Carey, of the Strand; I am in their employ -I could not tell how it was I fell over the stall, it was from some force; I was pushed over by the back part of my neck, and while I laid there, the bundle was taken forcibly from me - several people were about me; I did not know any of them - I kept fast hold of the bundle, and saved the handkerchief and one microscope; I ran after two females, who I suspected had part of the property, but could not overtake them - I called Watch! several times, but the watchmen were not on; I then went home- next morning I went to Mr. Wilson's, the house I was at, and told him about it; I had left Easden and Whaling behind in the house - they came out close after me -I did not at that moment notice whether Reader was in the house; I got about six yards from there when I was pushed down and robbed, and when I got up, I saw them close in the mob - I pursued them, but did not overtake them - while I was talking to Wilson next morning, Easden came into the house, and directly behind her, came Whaling; I immediately recognized them both as having been in the house there the day before, and asked if they recollected me being there the day before - Easden said "Yes, very well;" I asked if she knew what became of my bundle; she said she knew nothing whatever of it; I then asked her if she did not recollect that I had a bundle while I was in her company; she said she recollected that I had one while I was there - I asked if she had seen the contents of it; she said she knew nothing more about it, and had not seen me afterwards - I then went in search of my property, and found two in pawn at Mr. Newby's, and on the Saturday following, I found two more in Russell-court; I had left Easden and Whaling in Wilson's house, and returned there again in the evening and found them both there - they denied all knowledge of them; I told them they had pawned two at Newby's, and from the description, I was sure it must be them; I asked them to come with me to the pawnbroker's - Easden at first said she would go, and then she said I was no officer, she would not go, and dared me to touch her; Wilson sent for an officer, and when he came, they were all three in company in the house, and I gave charge of them - they were taken to the watch-house; when I got up from the kennel, I observed eight or ten people about me, but not before I got up; it happened at the corner of Harford-place - I did not particularly notice whether they were all women; from the appearance and dress of the two I pursued, I believe them to be the same women as had been in the house with me - they had the same dress on in the morning; I was searching for my property all the next day, and told them I would be there at six or seven o'clock in the evening, and they agreed to meet me there to see if I had heard any thing of it, as they denied knowing any thing about it.</p>

Bank of England note, a guinea, about 70l. in gold and silver, two promissory notes, one for 50l. and the other for 30l.; I know the number of the note, and stopped it at the Bank - about three weeks after I saw it; the prisoner was taken up soon after; I have not found the gold or silver, or promissory notes - a guinea was found, but mine had no mark on it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you, on the 3d of January, know the number of the note? A. I did - I had it entered in my book, (which is not here) on the Friday night, when I wanted my money, and saw it there on Saturday night, about half-past ten o'clock, when I gave change; I missed it in about an hour - I had not seen the prisoner that day; I was busily engaged in the shop - my cash-box was in the back parlour adjoining the shop; the person must have come over the back premises.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Where was the cash-box? A. In the parlour; a door from which leads into the wash-house, and then into the garden - both those doors were found open.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Are you married? A. Yes; my wife was sitting in the back parlour at ten o'clock, and about a quarter to eleven she went next door for some bread - I saw her go out; she returned in about ten minutes, and went into the back-parlour: my children were in bed- the servant was gone home; she does not sleep in the house: the back doors were fastened: my wife left the door leading from the parlour to the shop open - we missed the cash-box three-quarters of an hour after she returned; a person could come in at the back-door, and take the cash-box in her absence without my hearing them: the two doors were only on the latch - I had seen them latched at a quarter-past ten or a quarter to eleven o'clock; it must have been taken during the ten minutes my wife<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190009"/>was absent; I was in the shop all that time, but could not see the wash-house door, as it is rather on the left-hand side - the door leading to the shop is opposite to it, and was open, but I was behind the counter, which lays back, and I might have had ten or twelve customers to attend to; I do not know where the prisoner lived at the time - the same shopman lives with me now.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Had you seen the cash-box after the maid-servant went away for the night? A. Yes; when my wife came in, she found both doors open; when I went into the parlour I found the doors open, and missed the box.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You allowed him to go away? A. Yes; I could tell on what date the note was stopped, but my book is not here: I affix the notices against all notes that are stopped, and place the numbers on a card, which is put on each cashier's desk.</p>

On the night of the 9th of December, in consequence of suspicion, I watched masters' premises- there was a box of account-books placed under some bags of wool; it was sent to be shipped to the West Indies - it was under No. 3 crane on the quay, and marked<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190010"/>B. L.; I saw the prisoner on the quay about half-past ten o'clock - he had no business there: I saw him remove this box from under the bags of wool - I then left the quay, and told Wood what I had seen; he came and relieved me from the watch - I went, and returned again almost immediately, with a constable; we all three watched - I saw the prisoner come back again: the case was where he had left it, which was about two feet from the spot where it had been; there was a gas-light opposite - when he returned he had got something, with which he attempted to open the chest, by shoving it under the lid; the constable immediately seized him, and a crowbar was thrown down just by me - I found it, but cannot swear it was the instrument he used: I had never seen it on the quay before - I gave it to the constable; I went to the case, and put it back again.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How large was the case? A. About two feet two inches wide; it was not very heavy, but more than he could carry away without being seen - it weighed about 1 1/2cwt.; he was not in masters' service - I have known him many years as a lighterman about the quays: the gate was half shut - he could not see us.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he know the wharf and quay were Mr. Smith's? A. Yes; the case was opened next morning, and contained the articles stated in the indictment, which are worth above 18l.; there was B. L. in large letters on it.</p>

            . I am in the service of Messrs. Smith and Son. Payne came to me - I went and placed myself between two bags of wool, and could see the case, which had been moved about two feet; I saw the prisoner in about five or ten minutes, come and turn the case round - it was lying on the side; I saw him trying to wrench the lid, with something - he then walked away, came back again twice, and hit it with something each time, and coughed at the same time, he walked away, and went up the gateway; I watched him up the gateway -Payne and the constable came down; we went to the case, and there was a chisel sticking in it, between the head and the upper end - I went up into the crane-room- Payne and the constable concealed themselves, and in five minutes he returned to the case, and began to try to open it with something; the constable seized him, and I saw him throw down a small crow-bar - there was the print of the crow-bar on the case; I tried both that and the chisel next morning, and the marks corresponded.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Could not the box be easily carried away? A. I do not think he could carry it.</p>

            . I am a constable. Payne gave me information; I went with him through the gateway to Galley-quay, and got by the wicket - we met the prisoner coming up; I spoke to him, knowing him well - I went down the quay; they shewed me the chest with a chisel sticking in it, standing on its end - we went and sat down on the wool bags, and in four or five minutes the prisoner returned, came to the same place again, and began knocking; I said, "Halloo," and heard a piece of iron fall - Wood picked up the crow-bar; I had then taken the prisoner into custody, seeing him attempt to open the case.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Does the quay belong exclusively to Mr. Smith? A. I believe he rents it; a number of craft come to it - I met nobody but the prisoner at the gate; I believe he is a married man, and has a large family - I have known him thirteen or fourteen years; he belonged to the Tender; I produce the chisel and crowbar.</p>

            . I am matron of the Refuge. On the 31st of August, we went up to prayers, leaving the prisoner and one other person below; when we came down the closet was broken open, and four bundles gone, containing all the articles stated; they were the property of persons who came into the institution - the closet was locked up that Sunday, but I cannot say when I had seen the articles.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Did you see the closet locked that day? A. Yes; the other girl might have taken them.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Were more things taken than one person could carry? A. No.</p>

            . I am foreman of the wharf. -Whitefoot told me of this, and I overtook the prisoner at the end of Lower Thames-street, carrying the cask of butter; he said he was going to Gravel-lane, and a man employed him, but he could not tell who it was - I asked him to bring it back; he turned back about fourteen yards, and then said he would not carry it back; I got a lad to take it - it was to be shipped for Sheerness.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. This witness' evidence differs from what he said before the Magistrate. I was employed by a man in the public-street; as I was walking between St. Katharine's Dock-bridge and Irongate, he asked if I wanted a job; I said Yes; he said, "I want this tub of butter carried to Gravel-lane".</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was it not rather a dark night? A. Yes; I do not know where Montier lived - it is a common sized cart; I think the carman was sitting on one of the chests; I think the chest that was taken was within a yard of him - Bateson was brought into the public-house in about five minutes; Robertson, Wintle, and a butcher, who is not here, were with me -I kept thirty or forty yards from them, but when the tea was taken I had ran up, and was within ten yards of them.</p>

            . I am a headborough of Shoreditch. On the evening in question I saw Montier, Duff, and Bateson near Worship-street, in Shoreditch, and a fourth person in their company; I lost sight of them, and then met them again in Shoreditch, following a cart - supposing they knew me, I drew back; they passed Fryer, who was with me - there was a good light from a porkshop, and I looked well at them; I saw Montier cross the road, make a spring, and look in at the tail of the cart - he came back and joined his companions; the cart went on to the corner of Kingsland-road - the carman went into a grocer's shop; they all stopped in a body - there was a light in the grocer's shop, which enabled me to see them; I am not able to say whether there were more than four at that time - the cart went on to the toll-bar; the prisoners passed a little further, and waited - the cart went on, and they went on; I followed them, and then observed Sherrick - there were five persons then; Sherrick turned round two or three times - they kept crossing from one side to the other - the cart then began to trot, and they set out on a run; I and Fryer ran too - the cart suddenly stopped its pace, and Fryer came up with Bateson and another who is not in custody; Fryer said "Dear me, how lame I am;" I kept by the side of Bateson, and saw Montier and Duff go into the road, take hold of the chest, and carry it between them - Fryer and I ran towards them; they let go of the chest and ran off - he called Stop thief! and I made after Montier, who ran into Black Horse-field; it was dark and very muddy- I lost him in the field; I then returned, and met with Wintle, and as I came up I saw Sherrick, Bateson, and the person who is not in custody; I said "Here are some of the parties," and we made towards them - I heard Bateson say to the person who has absconded"How d-d lame he was, wasn't he, did you see him run?" I followed them with Wintle and another person, who had promised to assist him; I seized the man who has absconded, and Bateson at the same time - Bateson began to be obstreperous, and the other got away; Wintle then came up and took Sherrick: on the 12th I apprehended Montier and Duff, in Shoreditch - they were in company with a person who I believe was the person who got away on the 7th, but I could not swear<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190017"/>to him; as I took them to the watch-house, Montier said what did I want with them - I said "It is nothing but insulting a woman;" but when I got him to the watch-house I told him what it was for; I had seen them before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you? A. A hair-dresser; I have lived in Shoreditch twelve years - I suppose Bateson was about ten yards from me when the others took the tea; I was between him and them- I suppose Bateson was about thirty yards from them; I cannot say that I saw Bateson put his hand on the cart or the tea, but he passed and re-passed the cart frequently -I went after Montier in the field, and lost him; I came back to the road, and found Bateson on the other side of the way, nearly opposite the place where I left him - he was walking in conversation with the other two; I was in the field about a minute and a half - when I returned to the road I suppose thirty people had collected, from Fryers' having cried Stop thief! I collared him, and he took me by the neck with both arms - I knew Montier by following him on different evenings.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. When Montier was pursued, did they all run away? A. Yes; they ran towards Shoreditch - when I returned, they were coming from Shoreditch to the spot where the tea had been taken.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Had Robertson come out of the field when you saw him? A. He was just coming out; I had heard the cry of Stop thief! about five minutes before I came up - I had heard it two or three times; Bateson must have heard it - there was scarcely a soul about there, but there were some people further on; Bateson might have escaped if he chose, but there would have been a greater chance of his being taken.</p>

I had three chests of tea in my cart; I went up Shoreditch, and stopped at a grocer's at the corner, to ask if they knew the person I was going to, as it might be a new shop - I stopped at the toll-bar and paid 6d.; I was looking at the different shops - I looked round and saw my tail-board was down, and one chest gone; I said to a little boy "Did you see any body near me?" Yes, said he - I said "It will not do for me to stop;" so I went on, and delivered the two chests at Kingsland - in coming back I met a boy, who said "Your chest is found;" this is the chest I will swear - it was going to Mr. Mather, at Kingsland.</p>

            . I am a watchman. About half-past four o'clock in the morning of the 29th of January, I was at the bottom of West-street, Mile-end, Old-town -I saw the two prisoners going up the street - they bid me good morning; I went to my box, and stopped till five o'clock - I then went round my beat, and was returning to my box, when I saw them with something; I darkened my lantern, and saw Daniels with a stove on his shoulder, and the other with a copper - as soon as they saw my light, they threw them down, and ran off; I sprung my rattle, and pursued down Dog-row, and I lost sight of them - I met another watchman, and told him to follow them; I returned, and took the property - the watchman came and said he had lost them; I then went and found the shutters off at an empty house, and these things had been taken from it: I cannot be positive as to the prisoners, but I speak from their height, appearance, and dress.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You had never seen Mundon before? A. No; he is not an uncommon height - their backs were towards me after the first time; at Bethnal-green watch-house they had the same clothes on - Mundon's coat was black with soot, but I did not see it.</p>

My beat is at the bottom of the Black Dog: I was standing by a post, about twenty minutes before six o'clock, and the two prisoners came into the house - they were in a flurried state; I followed them, and saw Mundon's coat was black from shoulder to shoulder - I knew him, and asked him if he had been sweeping chimneis; he said No, it was grease - I went close to him, put my hand on his shoulder, and I found the black came off on my fingers; they went into the taproom - Mundon took off his coat, and exchanged it with another lad; I went to the watch-house, and stated what I had seen - our inspector pressed me and another to go down to the Black Dog; we went down, and saw but two persons, but on looking round, we saw Mundon concealed under the table - he said he had broken a button off his clothes, and was stooping to pick it up; I went to Mr. Christian, and we went to the place the property was taken from: Thompson swore to the prisoners.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he not say he had not seen their faces? A. Yes; I saw these men at the Black Dog, and then went to the watch-house; I had not left them in custody - I think I was not half an hour gone.</p>

I said, "It is nothing to you" - I went home, and just as I got up stairs I saw him coming up the stairs; the other two men were at the bottom - I said, "I don't want you to follow me:" he sent a young woman for a pot of beer, and gave her a sixpence, which he said was all the money he had; he shewed a handfull of duplicates, and said he had parted with all these things that week: the girl brought in a pot of beer; the prosecutor then pretended to go to sleep - he said he should like to go to bed; I said, "You cannot, for I expect my husband home;" he said, "I will give you what you please to sleep with that young woman;" I said,"You cannot do any thing of that kind here" - he then shut the door, and said, "I will not go out to-night;" I called up the other men, and said, "I wish you would take this man away;" the prosecutor said, "If you will lend me a collar I will pawn my shirt, and get 3s. upon it;" he said, "I have a few halfpence, and I must have a drop of gin before I go;" he then took off his waistcoat, to take his shirt off - I said, "You shall not do any thing of the sort here;" he then swore he would make me suffer for it - he walked out, and had us taken up, but he did not come for near an hour, and we had laid down; I had had two or three drops of gin, and some beer - it had overcome me; I heard a knock at the door, and I got up - the officer said, "Here's a pretty concern here;" the beer still stood on the table, and I said, "Did you come back for your beer - here it is;" I then said, "Does he want his sixpence?" the officer said, "No, it is a half-sovereign:" the prosecutor then came in, and said, "Take that woman."</p>

On the 12th of February, at a quarter-past eight o'clock, I was called up, and told a man had run away with a carcase of mutton; I followed the prisoner, and overtook him in South-street, about one hundred yards from my master's - he had turned a corner; I knew it was my master's mutton, and my dressing.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Do you mean to say I had the mutton when you came up? A. Yes, you had it on your shoulder, and threw it on a step.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure the sheep that was missing was the same he was carrying? A. Yes, my Lord.</p>

I was within one hundred yards of the shop, and saw a man pass me with a carcase of a sheep on his shoulder; in a minute I heard the cry of Stop thief! and I went and took the prisoner, whom Jennings had hold of - the carcase of the sheep was about thirty yards from him.</p>

On the 21st of January, about half-past five o'clock, (my little boy had just come in, and was sitting by the fire,) I went into the room to get something off the fire-place- the prisoner came into the shop; I had lost a ham the day before, and had put a saw across this ham that they should not get it - the prisoner took off the saw, put it down, and took up the ham; I ran to him and said, "You had a ham yesterday, but you sha'nt have this to-day" - my little boy came up; he dropped the ham, and ran out of the shop - I pursued some distance, but was exhausted, and turned back; my little boy followed till he was taken- I had known him before.</p>

            . I am in the service of the prosecutrix. Cooper used to come to see Dotkin - she told me her mistress had said that Cooper ought not to come; it was two or three weeks before this happened: on the night of the 17th of January, a bed had been opened, but I do not know how long, or whether any feathers had been taken from it - I had seen it before, but I do not know whether it was as full as it had been; it had been sewn up again - we used always to sleep on it, but on the Friday night we slept in another room; it was the under bed - I saw Dotkin's motherat my mistress' several times; she was there that Friday night, and they were talking about gowns and things, and had a parcel under her cloak, which appeared to me like a gown; I should not have missed any feathers from the bed, if the officers had not - Dotkin came to me in the kitchen, and I told her I was frightened to see the officers come in; she did not say any thing to me that night about what I was to say or was not to say - I mean to swear that; I am still in Mrs. Wilson's service.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was the bed ever searched for feathers, while you were there? A. No. I had been there three months; I heard Dotkin ask her mother to send her some feathers two or three weeks before, and she promised to send her some to make a pillow; I am on good terms with my mistress; if I had seen this bed after the charge, I could not have perceived that any feathers had been taken out of it.</p>
               <p>MRS. WILSON re-examined. Q. What sort of a bed was this? A. It was a common feather bed. I have not a doubt but that feathers had been taken out of it - I think it was quite obvious to any body; I do not know what quantity had been taken out - Dotkin said she intended to return the bolster-case; it being vacation time, we had changed the beds about, to keep them aired - I do not think Piggott slept on that bed again till the young ladies returned, but she had slept on it the night before; I do not know that the feathers are mine.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS called -- DOTKIN. I am the prisoner Dotkin's mother; I had seen her about three weeks before this robbery, and taken tea with her; Piggott heard her ask me for some feathers; I told her I had made use of the feathers that were her's, but I would give her some others, and I took her some in a large coarse apron - I took the apron home and washed it; I could not say that these are the same feathers, but they look a great deal like those I took out of my bolster. <rs id="t18290219-49-verdict265" type="verdictDescription">

            . I am an officer. On the 9th of February, I saw Douglas and Norris, about ten minutes before five o'clock, on the opposite side of the street, and King was on the same side as I was, with a bundle: I and Waters stopped her at the corner of Church-street, Bethnal-green, and took her into the Adam and Eve public-house - we found all these articles on her, which she said she had bought of a tallyman, who came to her house; I asked if she could tell where he lived, and she said No; we then searched her, and she had no money - we brought her out again, crossed over, and took the other prisoners, and took them all into another public-house; King then said,</p>
               <p>"Phoebe, have you been with me to-day?" Douglas said, "No, Nance, have you been with me to-day?" Norris said No; we took King, but let the other two go: but from further information we went again, and took them: last Saturday, as I was going up stairs at the office, I heard Douglas, whose voice I knew, call to a man in the lock-up place, and say, "George, it's all up," for the fatements were on them; he said, "Why did you not go in somewhere, and take them off?" she said, "We had not a bl-y farthing among us:" we took the prisoners about three-quarters of a mile from the prosecutor's.</p>

            . I was with Brown, and saw Douglas and Norris on the opposite side of the way; I called Brown's attention to them, and at that moment we saw King with the bundle; we took her into the house, and found these things; I then went out, and overtook the other two about one hundred yards off - we found nothing on them, and let them go; but on the Thursday morning we went and took them again - we asked them if they had been in any shop with King: they said No.</p>
               <p>KING'S Defence. I never was in the prosecutor's shop- I know nothing of these other women; the things were given me by a tallyman.</p>
               <p>DUGLAS'S Defence. I never saw this lady before I was at Worship-street: what the officers have stated is false- they knew me for some time.</p>
               <p>NORRIS' Defence. I was not on the same side of the way with King; the time I was first taken I had half a crown in my hand - I had been no higher than Bethnal-green school that day; I had not been in the road at all; on the Tuesday Waters met a lad in the Bethnal-green-road, he asked where I lived, and gave him brandy, and said if he told me of it he would police him.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you ever see any thing cruel in her conduct? A. Never; about four months after she came to us, we suspected she was in the family way - my sister is married; I did not know where the prisoner's father lived.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. When the prisoner had been five or six weeks with us, I charged her with being in the family way; she said No, she had only caught a cold - I got her some medicine to make her comfortable, and she said she was very well after that; I had agreed for her to leave us at Christmas: I asked her again a few days before Christmas, if she were not in the family way - she said she was not, so help her God; I said the parish-officers would come, she must tell me the truth, and I would be a friend to her; she said I spoke like a mother to her, and she would tell the truth, so help her God it was not so - I then agreed for her to stop longer. On the 3d of January, after my husband bad got up, she came up to me, and said she had been very ill in her inside all night: I said,</p>
               <p>"I heard you go down after four o'clock, but what is the matter?" I put the curtain aside, and said, "Why, Harriet, you have deceived me;" she said she had not: I said, "Why, you have miscarried - go up to bed;" she said,"I have not;" I went down stairs - every thing seemed in confusion; my husband shewed me marks on the work-table, on a chair, and the boxes. I carried her up some tea, and told her she had miscarried - she said, what would I say of her next; I went down, took her up another cup of tea, and asked what she had put in the privy - she said nothing, what would I say of her next, it was no such thing; we then went to seek for the child - my husband put a hoe down the privy; he called me, and I saw a full grown child there - he pulled it a few inches above the soil, on the hoe; when the constable came he got it up - it was washed, and laid on a table, for the medical gentleman to inspect; the *** had not been tied, but I tied it - the child was quite dead, and must have been there some time; she must have been delivered in the kitchen, on a brick floor - after this I said to her, "I know you have miscarried;" she said she had not - I said,</p>
               <p>"I know you have, for the child is found;" she said no more then.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you not tell the Coroner that she said the child did not cry, and she did not perceive that it had fetched breath? A. She said so to the doctor, admitted she had been delivered, and said she sat down in a chair, and almost fainted.</p>
               <p>MR. JOHN SYERS, surgeon, of Isleworth, deposed that he had minutely examined the child - that there were no external marks of violence - that the lungs appeared to have performed the function of respiration, and floated freely in water; they had a florid appearance, and assumed the texture which they would, having performed that function; but he could not say it was alive when entirely delivered; if it had fallen on the brick floor it might have been suffocated: he considered it decidedly a case of infanticide, by omission.</p>

Yes; she lived at Reading before she went to live with my father - he had this house about two years and a half I believe; he told me the prisoner lived with him as housekeeper - she came at his desire, and brought her three children with her, and carried on his business; the house is frequented by boxing men: I was there a fortnight before he died, and asked her if he were at home; she said he had not been very well, and was gone into the country, but I saw him just as I was going out at the door, but did not speak to him, as I did not know he was in the house till I was going out; I dare say I had not spoken to him for two months before he died, as he had been down to Bradford, Wilts, and I did not know he was in town: I was on good terms with him - he never turned me out of the house; I am now in possession of the house- there is now a suit pending in Chancery; I have indicted her for a conspiracy, with three others, upon this transaction.</p>

               <p>"Where is my Jack, I want to see my Jack;" the prisoner was not present, but I went down and told her, and asked if she could not tell where to find him - she said</p>
               <p>"I do not know where he is - I wonder he has not been here before now;" I first told her of it on the Thursday night - I told his cousin, and he went down to tell the prisoner; I went down to her myself, on the Tuesday or Wednesday, and every day I mentioned it, and said if she would tell me where he was to be found, my husband would go for him - she said she thought it strange he had not been there before, and would endeavour to try and send for him; she was always busy, and I cannot tell what answer she made when I offered to send my husband - I never heard Mr. Bond ask for him while she was in the room, I generally went down stairs, and left them; he died about three o'clock on the Saturday - the prisoner was there, after he had been dead some time - she took every thing out of his box; there was a large ledger, a silver tankard, and different things - she took them all up into her bed-room in her apron; there was some paper: on the Thursday I found two bills in his bed, and there were two 500l. notes under the bolster - I put them into the tankard, and they went up in her apron.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you look at the two 500l. notes? A. Yes; it was on the Thursday night before he died - he must have fetched them out of his box in the afternoon while I was down making some tea; I had left a boy with him - I had made his bed in the morning; they were not there then - I swear they were Bank of England notes, notes, not hair-dressers' flash notes; I never saw a flash note - they were exactly as Bank notes; it said 500l., and they were much worn, where they were doubled up; he was insensible when I took them from under the pillow - he had a fit almost every minute, and would not keep in bed ten minutes together, but was taking all his clothes out of the drawers, and routing about; I told nobody about these notes, not even my husband - in my opinion the deceased's mind was broken ever since the Wednesday when he had a convulsive fit, but at times he answered me correctly: I did not then tell him I had taken the notes from under his pillow - I thought his mind broken, and it was useless to disturb him: he had two strong fits on Wednesday, and then the doctor said he was dying; he would at times answer me, Yes, or No, but he had no knowledge whatever after the fits: the box was usually kept locked, but the key remained in it from the Tuesday till he died - I was never out of the room till he died, and am certain the notes were there; nobody could have gone to the box without my knowledge: I asked him where his son lived - he said in a street in Oxford-street, and at that time somebody came into the room; Mrs. Hall was not present: (looking at two flash notes) these are not the notes I saw under the pillow - they were blacker and dirtier than these, and more worn, but not worn as these are - they were more worn in the fold, but not torn at all.</p>

            . I am a surgeon, and attended the deceased in his last illness. The prisoner asked me to present him with the codicil of a will - that produced appears to be the same; I think it was on Wednesday, the 9th of July - there was no signature to it then; the prisoner placed it in my hands, requested me to read it to him, and to ask if he would sign it - I took it up stairs, and finding him in a tranquil state, I told him his sister had presented me with a codicil of a will, to ask him to sign - he said he was already acquainted with the contents, I then said, "Do you approve of it?" he said he did; I said, "Will you sign the document?" - he said No, he would not; I then withdrew, took the codicil back to the prisoner, and told her he would not sign it -I did not read it to him, as he said he was already acquainted with the contents; I did not tell him the contents, concluding, from his answer, that he had seen it before - in fact, to the best of my recollection, he told me he had read it; he did not take it into his hand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You would not have presented it to him, unless you thought him sufficiently tranquil to sign it? A. Certainly not.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did he give you any reason why he would not sign it? A. No - I do not recollect his ever telling me, it was because he thought if he recovered he should lose all controul over his property; I will not swear he did not say so, but, to the best of my recollection, he made no observation, except that he would not sign it; I saw him about three times a day - at times he was not in a state to judge for himself, at other times he was in a state of delusion, but, to the best of my judgment, he was at times in a state to judge for himself; on the Thursday and on the Friday there were intervals when he was perfectly sensible - I never introduced the subject to him again.</p>

Since I have been in Mr. Wright's office - it is not my business; I felt compassion for the prosecutor, and introduced him to Mr. Wright, whose employ I entered in September last - I had nothing to do with the will, but with the Chancery suit; I was clerk to Mr. Hughes, of Clifford's Inn, for five years - there is an indictment against the prisoner, Silcock, and two others, for a conspiracy; the deed which Bond executed is here - I think he makes a long A, but do not remember; the A to the codicil is a round one; he makes a round B, not like this one, which has the first stroke straight - whether he turned his d round at the end I do not know; the character of this hand-writing is different altogether - I used to go to his house for Mr. Hughes on business: I do not go there now, except on business - I might look in when I am passing; the Chancery suit is undetermined - the prisoner is in contempt for not putting in her answer; we obtained an injunction which would have shut up the house - she withdrew her caviat since this indictment has been found, which was in December; she has been out of the way ever since till five weeks ago.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Do you believe the name, "A. Bond," there to be his hand-writing? A. I am sure it is not; I am a surgeon, and practice where occasion requires, in London and in other places; I practised this morning - my shop hitherto has been in Clerkenwell prison, as I am indicted for a conspiracy.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know of any authority being given to any body to sign that name? A. No.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. How long ago were you taken up? A. On the 23d of November: if I thought right I dare say I could procure bail, but I remain in prison for my own personal safety - my shop was in Tottenham-court-road; the prosecutor does not bring me here - I have come of my own accord to vindicate myself; I have come by order of the Court. I suppose - I know the Marlborough Arms public-house, Blenheim-steps; I never told any body that if the prisoner gave me 100l. I would swear any thing, but if not I would turn round to John Bond's side, nor any thing of the kind.</p>
               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. You have said that signature is not Anthony Bond's writing; you may decline answering, but do you know whose writing it is? A. Mrs. Halls - she did it the day after his death, in the afternoon, at the Rising Sun; I disclosed that fact voluntarily.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. Did you write to the attorney for this prosecution, that if he would let you off the indictment for conspiracy, you would come forward on this prosecution? A. Never, nor to that effect - I decline stating whether I made any affidavit in the case.</p>

I made an affidavit at Westminster-hall in November - I always thought the prisoner lived on very good terms with the deceased; she managed his business, and the greatest harmony prevailed between them - I never heard he had a son till this happened.</p>

               <p>MR. CURWOOD. Q. If this will be a good one, she is entitled to all this property? A. In trust for her children, but she stated to me, what I believe to be true, that she is a large creditor under her brother's estate; the proceeds of the business she carried on at Reading were paid to her brother, who bought the lease of the Rising Sun with it, she furnished him with other money, which was confirmed by the attorney, and I advised her to give up the property, as she could establish her claim as a creditor and obtain it back in that way; I felt confident this indictment never would be prosecuted, except for costs - the valuation of the house and property is under 400l. - she was to administer under 450l.</p>

On the evening of the 5th of February I and another person examined that box - there were nine packages of vermillion in it, to which I had affixed my initials some time before; I locked the room, and had the key in my possession till between ten and eleven o'clock the next morning, when I opened it again, but I did not look at the vermillion at that time - the labourers are not permitted to go to the inner store-room, except by permission of Mr. Clutton or me; that is a well-understood rule in the factory, and applies to all the persons there - on that day the prisoner was sent to that room by Mr. Clutton, in my presence, for some nails; I was busy, and did not particularly notice the time he was gone - about half-past five o'clock, on the same day, I went to look at the vermillion, and there were only six packages - these three were gone; I went to Mr. Gibbins' house, which is about three-quarters of a mile off -I then came back, and in consequence of what Mr. Cluttion said, I went to the privy with a light, and found Turvey sitting on the seat; I said I wanted him - he said,"Very well;" he waited a few minutes with the door open - he then got up, and began to button his clothes: he then said he had a bowel complaint, sat down, and pulled the door too - he staid a few minutes, then followed me into the factory, and from thence into the kitchen, where Mr. Gibbins and the officer were; I went into the privy again, and saw these three packages of vermillion on a beam which runs through the privy, near the top of it - it is a broad stay-beam, of the factory; the prisoner could reach that beam, but a person an inch shorter, I should think, could not - these packages are three which I had marked; I then went to the kitchen, and called the officer - he went with me, and I saw him take the packages down; I examined them directly; the privy is near the bottom of the stairs, on the ground floor, not in any yard - there were four labourers employed on the premises that day, besides Mr. Clutton and myself; I should think no person could have gone to the privy without attracting the attention of some of those persons - there was no opportunity of concealing these packages, unless by putting them into the soil; from the front of the warehouse I think you go twenty-five yards to the steps, then up a flight of steps to the store-room.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. A man an inch lower than the prisoner could not have reached the beam? A. I think not - we had measured his height a few days before; he is five feet nine inches - I have had no quarrel with him; persons come to the factory to bargain for articles, but no one came that day - I was there all day; no one could come without my knowing it - I believe Mr. Gibbins has seven children, four maid-servants, and one man; I opened the store-room door in the morning, and did not lock it again - I left the key in the door; I cannot swear whether any body in the warehouse might have gone into that room - the prisoner went there about one o'clock; I was very busy, and did not go into the room for four hours and a half afterwards - I went to the prisoner in the privy, and do not know whether I disturbed him - the door was open, so that any one might have seen what he was doing; after he had shut the door he might have thrown it down the privy, but the soil was too stiff to conceal it, and he had nothing to push it in with; I had not seen Mitchell in the privy just before him - the prisoner lived near the factory; the men go to dinner at one o'clock - it was just before dinner that he was sent to the store-room; he went home, and had an opportunity of leaving it at home - we rub down the men before they go; I rubbed the prisoner down that day; I did not tell the Magistrate I neglected to rub him down at one o'clock- it was neglected when he went out at half-past seven in the evening with the horses; he had a coat on, but had no pockets in the tail of it that he could have carried the vermillion in; I have seen the coat, and he has told me so many times - he certainly might have put a package in the hind part of his breeches; I had gone into the room several times - I do not know of any other person going in but the prisoner; other persons might have gone - Mr. Clutton sent Turvey to the room.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Do Mr. Gibbins' servants live in the factory? A. No - they live at his house, which is three quarter of a mile from there; it is known that the men are rubbed down - the prisoner has told me he had no pockets in his coat, and I think he could not have had any packages without my knowing it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Whereabouts is the privy? A. I should think about twenty yards from the stairs, where you go up to the upper factory, and to the store-room - I did not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190033"/>look at the packages when I opened the door about eleven o'clock in the morning.</p>

On the 7th of February, about one o'clock, I desired the prisoner to go into the inner store-room for some nails; I thought him gone rather longer than there was occasion for - I and Millson are the persons authorised to give permission to go into the room; I did not desire or give permission to any one else to go that day; about half-past five o'clock three packages of Chinese vermillion were missed; I consulted with Millson, and he went to inform Mr. Gibbins - I remained in the factory; while he was gone I kept a watch upon the prisoner, but endeavoured to conceal from him that I was watching him till Millson's return; Millson rang the bell, which adjoins the factory where I reside; I went into the factory with him - I do not recollect that the prisoner said any thing while Millson was gone; after his return he expressed himself as violently affected with the bowel complaint; but before that he had asked me whether he should not go and fetch in some tiles; I said No, as the following day would be Sunday, and there would be time for the truck to get dry- his going to get the tiles would have afforded him an opportunity of going off the premises to the front court: he also mentioned about going to fasten some doors, and I said I had seen to that - I think it was about a quarter before eight o'clock when he mentioned about this affection of his bowels; he repeated it soon after, and went to the privy - he did not take a light: I believe the lights were standing where we were, and where he had been at work - I did not go to the privy in consequence of what Millson said till after the men were gone; articles of this sort could not have been concealed under the soil without being hardly pushed down, for during the hard frost we had been very short of water, and had not let down more than was just sufficient to clear the pipe, and had not let the boy stir it up as usual, by that means the top had become hard.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you take the trouble of measuring the soil in that privy? A. Yes; it was ten inches deep; all the workmen had access to that privy - the soil had not been frozen, but it was stiff; I suppose the storeroom is about twenty yards from where I was - I had only that distance to have gone if I had chosen to go, but we were busy, as we were fearful a load of goods would not be in time for the docks; the vermillion had been marked by Million, by Mr. Gibbins' orders; Millson was heading up a tierce - I believe the prisoner has been about twelve months in Mr. Gibbins' employ; persons do come to the factory - I do not know whether any person came there that day; Millson does sometimes rub the men down, and I do sometimes - I will not say I rubbed the prisoner down that day; I believe I rubbed one man down.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. Is there not a particular hour of the docks at which goods are taken in? A. Yes; they object to taking in goods after three o'clock; I was on the premises when the men went to dinner, and at two o'clock I returned to the factory - I was in the store-room the greater part of the time after that; I did not observe any one go into the store-room till Millson came in - the other men were in the factory at half-past seven o'clock; they leave at eight.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. If you were in the room, what is the reason you did not look at the vermillion? A. I was busy; I could have done it, but I did not.</p>

            . I am a labourer at Mr. Gibbins'. On the day these things were missed I was sent to the warehouse over the way, to pack two casks - the prisoner was with me; he asked me which was the dearest colour I ever knew; I said I believed crimson lake, and I thought it was about five sovereigns a pound; he then asked what vermillion was a pound; I said about eight shillings - I did not go that day into the inner store-room for any purpose; I went to the privy about ten minutes before eight o'clock, I believe - the prisoner came down soon after, and said he wanted to go down very bad, as he had had a pain in his inside all day; he said to me, "Make all the haste you can, as I want to go there very bad;" I went, and when I came back I met him going down - I know the beam which runs across the privy; it forms a sort of shelf- I did not observe any thing on that beam while I was there.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you particularly observe the beam? A. No; if the prisoner had chosen, he might have waited till I went away, and then I should not have seen him; I cannot exactly say how high the beam is, but I do not suppose the prisoner could have reached it without standing on something - a person much less than him could have reached it by standing on the seat; all the most valuable colours are kept in the store-room - I do not know that we had any crimson lake; Chinese vermillion is the most valuable colour we have there.</p>

            . I am clerk to Mr. Gibbins. On the 7th of February I was out collecting nearly the whole day; I had not been to the store-room that day, nor the day before; about seven o'clock that evening I was outside the factory, and saw the prisoner's wife passing the place several times - sometimes on one side of the way, and sometimes on the other; she sometimes held up her umbrella, though it did not rain - she did not come in; I was down stairs when the prisoner was taken - he was searched very willingly; he took off his things, and nothing was found on him - he said he would willingly come to work on the Monday morning, and he hoped Mr. Gibbins would not lock him up, as it was a hard case for a man to be locked up all day on Sunday.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Were there any marks of paint on him? A. Yes, but not more than the occupations of the factory would have obliged him to have; his wife had<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190034"/>been in the habit of calling occasionally, and bringing his tea - it had been raining that day.</p>

On the Saturday a basket of linen came from the mangler's, I did not look at it till Monday, the 19th, and then missed a shirt - I then looked into the prisoners' box, and there I found the pieces of leather; they had but one box between them; I sent Froud out on an errand, and sent my little girl up stairs to see if she could see any thing of the shirt; she found the leather and told me - I went and found it there; I took it up to my husband, who was ill in bed, and asked if he knew any thing about it; when Froud came home he brought the money from the place where we sent him to, and went up to his master - and when he came down I asked him if he knew any thing of the leather in the box; he said "No; I know nothing of that in the box, I know of that behind the box," where I had found some pieces, and nearly a whole calf-skin; he said he had put them there; I asked if he had ever done any thing of the kind before; he said Yes - that he took a pair of soles and a pair of half soles down to his father's, and Robinson took a pair of soles and a pair of half soles to his mother; Robinson was not at home, but he came home about half-past nine o'clock; my husband asked him if he knew of things being put there- he said No, then he said "Yes, I did; and I took the calf-skin for a patch for my shoe;" my husband said, "Did you take a pair of soles to your mother's?" he then fell down - I went to his mother's residence at Merton, where we found seven pairs of soles, seven pairs of upper-leathers, and some other things - these are the articles, and these are what I got at Froud's father's; Robinson used to come to see her son, and I treated her like my own mother.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Robinson only said he took the bit for a patch for his shoe? A. Yes - we were not speaking of a whole skin; the calf-skin was not there then - the officer was present; it was a whole calf-skin except three quarters which had been cut out of it; they are all my cutting and my marking - the box was not locked - I would never allow them the key.</p>

            . I am a shoemaker. On the 20th of January I and Groombridge went to Mrs. Robinson's house at Merton; I said, "I believe your name is Robinson?" she said Yes - I said, "Do you know Mr. Groombridge, I believe your son is apprentice there?" she said Yes; I said I believed there was some leather there; she said, "So help me God there is nothing here;" I said,"He has good grounds to think so - if you will let us search that will settle all;" she went into the other room -I pushed the door open, and saw her go to some drawers and pocket something, but I could not see what it was - I asked for a candle, and she said there was none in the house - I sent Mrs. Groombridge for one; Robinson tried to get out, but I detained her - I then looked and found a candle; when Mrs. Groombridge came back, I told her to see what was in Robinson's pockets - she struggled away, went behind the bed, and threw something out of her pocket - I stooped down, and found this parcel of upper-leathers; I said she had some more - her pocket was searched, and I found two pairs more in it; I then went into the other room, she said there was nothing there, but I went in and saw a bedstead case, I pulled it round, there was no bedstead in it, but in it I found this bundle of upper-leathers, which have Mr. Groombridge's mark on them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. She said she did not know of any of Mr. Groombridge's property there? A. I asked for his property, and she said she had no leather of his - I know this leather to be Mr. Groombridge's, because I am in his employ.</p>

I was going down Kingsland-road, and saw six or eight lads in company - one of them said to a little boy, "If you cannot draw the handkerchiefs, cut the string of the shoes, for they will wedge well; "I followed him - he went to the shop and cut the string; the prisoners stood at the door with an apron, and took the shoes from the child - the little one who cut them ran away; I had seen Brown at the corner of Wellington-street, but did not see him do any thing.</p>

I was coming up Holles-street; I heard something fall, and a person came rushing by - I turned round, and was going to a shop: this young man came up and asked what I had done with the flannel -I said, "What flannel?" I turned, and looked down some areas with him; he said, "You have thrown it down some of these areas" - I said, "I do not know what you mean;" he then collared me, and I certainly did run from him - he fell down; a person came up, who said I was not the person.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What is Mr. Cook's second Christain name? A. Simpson - he told me so yesterday; he had a very good character with this young man, except about drinking - he was so drunk that day that when he was asked for a glass of wine at dinner, he brought beer, and when he was asked for beer he brought cheese; he was always a very good servant - he left all his things behind him, and did not have his wages.</p>

            . I am a silversmith. About seven o'clock in the evening of the 10th of February, the prisoner brought these spoons to me, and asked what I would give for them - I think he was about half-and-half; I asked him what he wanted for them - he said 1l., and I took him to Bow-street.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What are they worth? A. I suppose they cost about 8l.; I would have given 6l. for them.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I was left very young an orphan, and this is the first disgraceful act I ever committed.</p>

No; I was in service, and drove a team of horses over three ducks; the woman went and got a warrant for me - I asked her if she would make it up; she said she would if I paid for them - I said if I paid for them I should like to have them, and I took them; I was not tried for stealing them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you brought the bricks here? A. No - I did not think there was any occasion; it was not because I did not wish the Jury to see what they were - I went for an officer; he drove his cart, and I went with him - the officer did not tell me, now I had got the bricks to let the man alone; he picked up from sixteen to twenty bats in my presence - it was day-light.</p>

On the 7th of February the two prisoners came in to look at some gauze ribbons - being suspicious of them I watched, and while the person who was serving them turned his back, Jones took a piece and put it under her shawl; I let them stop till they were served, and told Gibbon, who asked them to walk up to the end of the shop, and in going along one of them dropped the ribbon- they had bought two yards and a half, and paid 2s. 6d, for it; I did not see the ribbon fall, but I saw it on the floor, and saw it taken about five minutes before.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How far were you from the woman? A. About four yards; Heath served them, but he turned his back to get some more ribbon; I think there were four other young men in the shop, the rest were gone to their tea - there might be ten customers; we were not busy: when I saw them take the ribbon I went to speak to Gibbon, and they were still being served - I saw them put the money on the counter; I could not see who dropped it, but it was on the floor - it could not have fallen by accident; I did not tell the Magistrate she put it under her cloak - they were taken into the parlour in about three minutes; I went and told Gibbon, and followed about five or ten yards behind them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Greaves came and spoke to you? A.

            , JUN. I saw the prisoner and another between six and seven o'clock; the prisoner had this chair on his head - I went and told my father; he went and stopped him going up, Bell-yard - he said he brought it from No. 12, Waterloo-street, and then that a boy named Edwards took it from a broker's shop, and gave it to him.</p>

There was no dance at this time - there was a fiddler; the prisoner took the watch out of the prosecutor's pocket, and hove it under the table; I did not see that she had been playing with him - she ran a little way, and he took her; there were twelve or fourteen persons in the room: I did not see any lark.</p>

            . I am a broker, and live on Saffron-hill. I bought these shutters, on the 27th of January, of the prisoner; I asked him how he came by them; he said his father was a dealer in marine-stores - he had these by him, and wanted to dispose of them, as he was in want of money.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. The shutters were sold to you on the 27th? A. Yes, for 2s.; I had bought three small shutters of him the day before - I did not ask him then what his father was; we bought nineteen shutters in all of him - my brother bought the others; on the 3d of February he brought five more shutters, and I took him.</p>

Mr. Davies told me there was 1200l.; he said, "I assure you I had no more than what you have found, and what Mr. Needham has got - I have been squandering the remainder away for the last two years;" Needham had a bag of money, which I did not see found.</p>

I took him back to the Institution, and asked his name - he pointed to the letter, and said that was his name - that he lived at No. 134, Mary-le-bone-street; I said there was no such number - he said, "What if I tell the truth;" I said, "I can say nothing to that - where is the cloak?" he said, "What will the gentleman say if I tell the whole truth?" I said I could say nothing about that; he said, "I will tell the whole truth, it is pawned:" I said, "Where?" he said, "In Wardour-street;" I said,"At Harris'?" he said, Yes, for 30s. - I found it there: he got into dreadful agony, and said he felt not for himself, but his friends - he is very respectably connected.</p>

            . I am cook to Mr. Geddes. I remember the 22d of December, when the prisoner left the house - I saw the plate safe in the pantry, about half-past eleven o'clock that day; the prisoner came to me at one o'clock, and asked what there was for lunch - he went into his pantry, and about half-past one he came into the kitchen, and asked me if I wanted any water; I said No: I never saw him after that, till he was at Bow-street; at two o'clock the housemaid came down stairs, and she missed the plate. After I told the prisoner I did not want any water, I heard the street door shut - I did not see him go out, but after that I never saw him; no living creature came within the doors from that time till the plate was missing; the pantry windows were both fastened, and quite secure, and I found them secure when the plate was missed; every thing portable was taken, but the plate that was large was left behind.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Which is the way to get out of the house from the pantry? A. He had to come along a passage, and up stairs; there is a lower door: a person must pass the kitchen door to go out at either door; I was in the kitchen all the time - I know he went for water when I heard the street door shut, for he took the pitcher with him; I had told him I did not want any water - I did not see him with the pitcher, but it was gone; he used to fetch water every day, for drink for the parlour.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after he asked if you wanted water, did you hear the door shut? A. Directly - he went up stairs directly.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Were there any screws or fastenings to the pantry window? A. There are both, and they were fastened.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not one window always open in the pantry, to see when anybody came to the front door? A. Occasionally we opened it to look out, but it was never kept open.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you went into the pantry, after missing the plate, was the window open? A. Both the windows were fastened quite safe; the pantry window looks into the area; there are no steps to the area - it is a high area; there is neither door nor steps to it.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Are there not two ways out of the house? A. There is an area, but no door to it; the windows look into the area - they are not so high as the street: there is no way out of the house except at the street door; the prisoner took all his clothes with him, except an old shirt, some old stockings, and two or three collars; all he had was a suit of old clothes, and his livery, which he had on, and that he took with him.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you see me take the clothes? A. No - I did not see you go out.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Which of the servants were in the habit of opening the street door? A. Both of us, whoever was down stairs - both I and the cook; the prisoner always opened the door when he was in doors.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Would your having the key prevent anybody being let out? A. No.</p>
               <p>MRS. GEDDES. Mrs. Broadfoot came to see me that day; I let nobody in or out myself - when she went away I rang the bell for the prisoner to open the door; I walked down from the drawing-room, expecting the prisoner to open the door, but Hughes opened it - it was near two o'clock; there are two centinals placed nearly opposite our house, who must see anybody go in or out.</p>

            . I sweep the crossing at Buckingham-gate. On the Monday before Christmas-day I saw the prisoner, between one and two o'clock, with the water-pitcher in his hand; he put it at the right-hand entrance at the gate - I told him he had set the pitcher in an awkward situation: he made me no answer, but made all the haste he could into the Park, going in a direction from Stafford-row; he walked fast, and left the pitcher behind him - I took it from the gateway, and put it under the paling of the gateway, for security; it was afterwards taken to Mr. Geddes' - the place he used to get the water from, is down the stable yard, by the gate; he left it not many yards from the pump - the prosecutor's house is only five or six doors from the gate; I did not observe that he had any thing else.</p>

            . I am a Bow-street officer. I apprehended the prisoner at Southwell, Nottinghamshire, on the 2d of February; I asked him what made him leave Mr. Geddes' situation - he made no reply; I asked him who gave him a character to get Mr. Geddes' situation - he replied that he got acquainted with some person in London, who persuaded him to get a written character, which he sent to his mother at Haverill, near Chesterfield (I neither threatened nor promised him), and his mother sent to Mr. Geddes; I asked what he had done with the clothes he took away from Mr. Geddes' house - he replied that he had sold them; he said he thought he should be hanged if he were taken up for this robbery (there is a charge of horse stealing against him) - he afterwards said, as he came along on the coach, that he should be twisted; a horse was found in his possession, which he acknowledged he had stolen, that he might not be tried for this robbery, for if he were tried for this robbery he should certainly be hanged.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. At the time you took him at Southwell, did you find a horse in his possession? A. No - he had been detained there through a letter which I had sent down there: I brought him to town afterwards.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did I tell you I had a written character from my mother? A. Yes, you did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I tell you I had stolen a horse, to save me from coming to be tried in London? A. He told me he acknowledged to stealing a horse, that he should not be tried for Mr. Geddes' robbery, for if he were he should certainly be hung - he did not say he had stolen it, but that he had acknowledged to stealing it; I told him what I took him for.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. What did he mean by his saying he thought he should be hung if he were taken for this robbery? A. He had been detained at Southwell, and a horse found in his possession; I found him in prison, and brought him to town - I am quite sure I did not make him any threat or promise; I told him not to say any thing to criminate himself.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. My Lord and Gentlemen of the Jury, - on the 22d of December I received a letter from Nottingham, stating my wife was dangerously ill, and I must come down immediately, if I wished to see her; Mrs. Geddes had charged me with being intoxicated the day before, and told me I might look out for another situation as soon as I had cleaned myself - I cleaned myself, and left the house about a quarter-past one o'clock; I took out the pitcher for water, and put it down at the corner of the yard where I usually fetched water from; I went to a friend, and told him I was going down to my wife, and I intended to go back to Mr. Geddes', but my friend advised me to go down to Nottingham immediately, which I did.</p>
               <p>MRS. GEDDES. I did not discharge him; I told him I did not discharge him, but I thought it likely Mr. Geddes would, as, with a drunken servant, we were so very much afraid of fire, and I said, "If you behave well in our house I will do the best I can for you," to which he added, "I shall behave, no ways ill;" I did not specify any time for his going.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. Q. Did you not order me to go out as soon as I was cleaned, to look for a situation, and that you would do the same, as you were going round to the shops to order them to send you a servant? A. I did not; he distinctly told me he was not married.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Woodhouse, of No. 56, Torrington-square. On the 19th of February, I was going through <placeName id="t18290219-120-crimeloc685">Little Russell-street</placeName>

               <p>Q. You said before the Magistrate that you met the prisoner and another man? A. Yes - there were three, but I do not think the third was one of the party; only two laid hold of me: I cannot tell what became of the third -I endeavoured to call Watch! and got my face scratched; they put a hand on my mouth: they took my watch-chain and seals, by force - the watch remained, as the rivet in the ring broke, or they would have had the watch, but the guard prevented it; I did not feel my property taken: I did not feel the chain break - I missed it directly: the watchman came up, and took the prisoner off me - I was on my face and hands, and the two men were on the top of me; he took them off, but was obliged to let one go.</p>
               <p>Q. What sort of a blow did they knock you down with? A. One of them gave me a blow on the forehead, which made it bleed; it did not prevent my knowing what was going on - I have not found my property at all: I am certain my chain and seals were safe when they laid hold of me - I had buttoned my coat round at the top a few minutes before, and saw my seals; they were petit-ore: the watchman took the prisoner to the watch-house - the other made his escape; I had not power to help the watchman - they had escaped before I was up: I am positive the prisoner is one of the men who dragged me up the court - he was in my sight till I was knocked down, and when the watchman came up he was on the top of me, which was not quite five minutes; I had spent the evening at the corner of Little Wild-street, not at a public-house; I had drank a little: there was only I and two young men - I parted with them about half-past one o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What had you been doing for the half hour? A. I do not know that it was half an hour; I parted with them in Wild-street - I left them in the house: I went straight to Russell-street, but I met a young man whom I knew, and I just stopped to speak to him; I cannot positively say how much I drank - I was in a sufficient state to identify the prisoner as one of them; I suppose I was the worse for liquor, but quite sufficiently collected to identify him.</p>

            . I live in St. Giles', and am a watchman. On Saturday morning, at half-past one o'clock, I was crying the hour, and as I came along I heard a screaming, and ran into this passage; the prisoner and two more were on the top of the prosecutor, who was on his face and hands - his face was downwards: I collared the prisoner and another, and fearing they would serve me out. I was obliged to let one go, to spring my rattle, and kept the prisoner; I took him to the watch-house- his hat and the prosecutor's were in the court; I sent another watchman for them: the prosecutor came out of the court when I brought the prisoner out - he made the charge against him, of robbing him of his seals and chain, in his presence; the prisoner said some of them dragged the prosecutor in, and he went into the court to see - but he was the man who was on the top of the prosecutor when I went in, and I detained him; the prosecutor appeared against him next morning: I looked about when I got on my beat, in about ten minutes, but found none of the property; the prisoner had no hat on - he claimed one of those found in the court; the other two had their hats on - I did not see the hats found in the court myself: the prosecutor was very sober - there was no sign of liquor; I do not know the prisoner - he was sober also.</p>

               <p>Prisoner's Defence. About the time in question I was on the other side of Russell-street, and heard the prosecutor cry Murder! and Watch! I ran over to see what was the matter, and stumbled over him; two men ran away - the watchman came up directly, took me, and said I was one of them; I said "If so I should have run away:" the prosecutor did not charge me with robbing him at the watch-house, but with an assault - he was very tipsy.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Were you beaten, or thrown down? A. I do not wish to say any thing to injure them; I was knocked down by a blow on my chest, from a hand - perhaps I might receive more than one blow; I am not quite certain, I believe I was protected from a blow at my head, by my hat - I received a blow on the back of my head, and a blow on my breast; I came on the ground from the effect of the blow - I was kept down by my shoulders and arms, and my watch taken out of my pocket; I saw one of the party that stood over me take the watch out of my pocket, and hand it over to another of the party - I saw the watch plainly; they all left me - I was stunned with the fall, and cannot say which way they went; my watch was a very valuable gold chronometer, for which I paid forty guineas; the chain cost nine guineas - one seal cost three guineas and a half, and the other two guineas and a half; the key, one guinea and a half - I have never seen the watch since.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they say any thing to you during the time they were with you? under what pretence did they join you? A. I was not particularly in liquor, but they supposed I was in liquor; I had only two tumblers of punch, and some ale.</p>
               <p>Q. If you were not in liquor, how did you allow them to take your arm? A. One of them, I presume, pretended to be in liquor, and wanted my assistance; it is impossible for me to say why I allowed them to walk with me; I did not wish them to walk with me, but they wanted to assist me home - I do not recollect what they said; I never asked their assistance - I have no doubt but they asked me where I lived; I do not recollect it - I might have said I was going to No. 45, Kirby-street; I perfectly recollect telling them I was going to my lodging, No. 45, Kirby-street.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of you when you got up? A. I went to the corner of Kirby-street, and told the patrol, or watchman, I do not recollect which; the watchman came up, having Langham in custody - he was the one who had hold of my arm.</p>
               <p>Q. As soon as you saw him, did you know him to be the man who had hold of your arm? A. I was considerably stunned and alarmed at the time; I said at the watch-house he was one of the men.</p>
               <p>Q. When you first saw him, did not the watchman ask if he were one of the men? A. Being knocked down in that way, and I was so trampled upon, your Lordship may suppose I was confused; I did not say he was one of them, till I got to the watch-house - I told the watchman I had been knocked down, and robbed of my watch.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you say, "That man you have got hold of is one of the men?" A. I was not asked the question: I was called upon to give charge against the man at the watch-house, and I gave the charge - nothing passed till we went to the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you positively swear these are four of the five men who ill-treated you on that night? A. I am positive of it; it was a very clear, moon-light night, nearly as light as day - I am certain they are all the men.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. What are you now? A. I am in no business; I am merely a man - a gentleman; if you had been in the House of Lords on the 25th of July, you would have heard a case of mine decided; I had never seen the prisoners before - I dined between five and six o'clock; we dined at the Union public-house, Bucklersbury, then went to the King's Arms, till, probably, seven o'clock - then, having business to do, we went to the Fleece public-house, Threadneedle-street, and remained in conversation till after eleven o'clock; people are in the habit of going there - they make a particular sort of punch; it is not very strong - it is a small quantity of genuine brandy, and acid; we went to talk on important business regarding me - we remained there till twelve o'clock or half-past; then one of my friends was going towards the Tower - we went to the King's Arms, and had a bit of cheese, and certainly not exceeding three pints or two quarts of ale; I think there were six tumblers between us three, at the Fleece - I will swear we did not drink twelve glasses; it might be about ten - it is impossible exactly to tell how much I drank; as far as my recollection serves me, we did not drink twelve, or ten, glasses of punch - when we left the Fleece, we were perfectly sober and collected; as far as I recollect, I paid about 3s. 6d. - I might pay 5s.; I cannot recollect what I paid there, or at the King's Arms; I do not think I paid any thing there - we had clubbed together</p>
               <p>Q. Do you mean to represent you were not very much in liquor when you say this violence was used? A. I might be; of course I was rather in liquor, but I had my recollection - I am positive I told the watchman I was robbed of my watch, when he came up to me, at the corner of Charles-street; I do not recollect whether, when I got to the watch-house, the constable of the night asked me whether I had lost any property - I told him I had been robbed: I have no recollection of saying I had lost my watch three hours ago - I am certain I was<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190051"/>robbed when I was lying down; I am perfectly certain of that - I went to the watch-house about twelve o'clock next day, and asked for the man who had been locked up; I was not then aware that the other party had been taken; I might ask if any more were taken.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How soon did you hear of any more being taken? A. In the course of the Sunday, but I did not know how many.</p>
               <p>MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When you were told three were taken, did you not say, "What, are there four of you then?" A. I have no recollection of it; I think two were presented to me - I was not told till next day that four were taken; I have been to a public-house this morning, in the Old Bailey, and merely had one glass of peppermint - nothing else; perhaps I might have two glasses of peppermint - nothing else.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is your memory so imperfect, you cannot recollect what happened a few minutes ago? A. I merely drank two glasses; I have had nothing else since ten o'clock this morning, to my recollection - one of the patrols was with me, but he would not drink; I merely called for two glasses of peppermint - I paid 4d.; I offered to treat the patrol with a glass of porter, but he declined.</p>

            . I live at No. 7, Hatton-garden. On Saturday night, the 18th of January, about half-past twelve o'clock, I was at my mother's door; she is housekeeper at the Sewers' office - my mother was up cleaning - she went over the way to get some beer; I and my brother stood at the door till she returned: while I staid at the door, I saw Mr. Munro, and five men coming up the street with him - there were five besides him; they came up from the corner of Holborn - Mr. Munro was a little in liquor, for he talked to the men rather too freely; he walked very steady - the prisoners Birmingham and Redgard had hold of his arms; they had hold of him, and Langham walked first - Kelly, and the one who is not caught, walked behind; when they passed our door, they stood at Mrs. Jones's, next door, No. 8, and then Birmingham put his hand into Mr. Munro's pocket, behind, and took out a handkerchief, which he returned again - it was a cotton handkerchief, I think, by what I saw; Birmingham, and the man who is not caught, then bid Mr. Munro good night, crossed the road, and went up Holborn, in a different way to what the rest went: Langham then took hold of Mr. Munro's arm, and went up Hatton-garden, towards Kirby-street - I know nothing more; I lost sight of them - my brother left me, and followed them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. What kind of a morning was it? A. Very fine; I am not usually up so late - I was not afraid, as my mother had only gone a little way.</p>
               <p>Q. Was not a cap put on Birmingham's head at the office, before you swore to him? A. Yes, there was; it was put on after I went there - he wore the cap on the night of the robbery; I swore to him by the cap, and by his dark clothes: I did not identify him till the cap was put on; I said I knew the cap, because there was a little hair off the front of it - I saw Kelly put the cap on Birmingham's head; I had no opportunity of seeing his face, and should not have known him, except from the cap and dress.</p>
               <p>Q. Mr. Munro appeared in liquor, because he was talking so freely to the men? A. Yes; they were at the next door - he was bidding them good night; he shook hands with one of them; I do not know which - it was the one who is not taken: I heard nothing else; he did not mention his name when he bid him good night - I did not know any of them till their hats were put on; it was not by their faces that I knew them: it was a beautiful moon-light night.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. You would not have been able to swear to them, but from their dress? A. No; Birmingham wore a cap, and Kelly a hat, on that night - Redgard had a leather apron, a fustian coat, and a hat; the other had a white flannel jacket, and a hat - I have no doubt of their being the men.</p>

            . I am brother to the last witness. I was at my mother's door with her, between twelve and one o'clock in the morning of the 19th of January; I saw five men coming up Hatton-garden - Mr. Munro was with them; the man with one eye (Birmingham) had hold of his arm - I observed at that time he had only one eye; I could not tell what colour his dress was - he had a cap on; I am quite sure he is one of the men who had hold of Mr. Munro's arm: I observed Langham behind Mr. Munro; he had a white flannel jacket on, as he has now - I did not see his face; I knew him by his jacket: he had a hat on, and was walking behind Mr. Munro, when I first saw him - I saw Redgard, and one who is not here, (he had light trousers on) walking in front; and Kelly was walking in front: they kept in this position all the time, till Birmingham and the other, who is not caught, wished him good night, and both crossed over the street: Langham then laid hold of the gentleman's arm, and they went on till they came to Charles-street - then they went to Kirby-street; then Birmingham, and the one not taken, met them again, joined them, and then they all surrounded Mr. Munro, and all got round him; Langham then went over the road, to see what number he lived at, and before he got half-way over the road, the others knocked Mr. Munro down: I could not see which, for they were all round him; I did not see any blow given - I saw him lying on the ground, and before he was on the ground, I saw his arms pinned back; then he was knocked down, and some man swung a watch round to another man - then Langham crossed over the road, and seeing him lying in the road, he went up Kirby-street; I followed him, saw a watchman, and told him to take him - the others ran down Union-court.</p>
               <p>Q. How soon after they swung the watch round, did they run away? A. About five minutes; they went down Union-court, which is not far from Kirby-street, before Langham came back - they all ran, and one of them fell down; Langham walked because he saw me - he crossed over to see the number, and was not there when the watch was taken; I told the watchman, and he took Langham; the others got out of sight - before the robbery took place, Birmingham asked me twice what I wanted; I said, Nothing - I was then following them, where they were crossing over.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Was Birmingham near the prosecutor, when he asked you what you wanted? A. Yes, and so was I; I did not state about his having only one<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190052"/>eye before the Magistrate - what I said was read over to me; nothing was read about his having one eye - I have talked to my sister about this, but not very often; I learnt the names of the prisoners at the office - they were pointed out, and their names told me, by a gentleman; he did not point out that Birmingham had only one eye: I did not mention about his having only one eye, at the office, nor till now, but I observed it that night, and knew him by that - the Magistrate did not ask how I knew him; I saw both Mr. Munro's arms pinioned - I was across the raod, and did not like to go up, as they asked me what I wanted, but I saw them behind him, with his arms pinioned; it was while he was standing up that I saw the watch swung, and when his hands were pinioned - the watch was swung round, just as he was knocked down, and then they ran; I cannot tell whether he was on his legs when I saw the watch swung - I am certain two of them bid him good night; they were then next door - I do not know whether my sister had gone in then; I did not see either of them do any thing then.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. He had hold of his arm when he bid him good night? A. No, Langham took his arm then; I was about six yards from them when they bid him good night - neither of them shook hands with him, that I saw; I am going on for thirteen years old - I was not sleepy; I generally go to bed about eleven o'clock, but my mother was up washing.</p>

            . I am a watchman. I saw Francis O'Hara, as I was crying one o'clock; Langham passed me, walking, and O'Hars stood at the end of Kirby-street, when he heard me calling the time, he hallooed out to me, "Stop that man watchman!" I said,"What has he done?" he said, "He, and four more, knocked down a gentleman in Kirby-street;" Langham was near enough to hear it - I said, "Where is the rest of them?" he said, "They are gone down Union-court;" I turned back - followed Langham, and brought him back - he never offered to run, or any thing; I brought him back to Mr. Munro, and asked if he knew any thing of that man - he said, at first, that he did not; he was standing up, with his back to a post, when I got up - I said, "Come to the watch-house;" Langham was searched there, and nothing found on him - Mr. Munro, when we got to the watch-house, said he was one of the party, and we locked him up; Langham said he knew nothing about it.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. He could hear the boy tell you he was one of the five who knocked a man down? A. Yes - I was not within ten yards of him; he kept walking on, till I laid hold of him, and did not attempt to run away - the constable of the night asked Mr. Munro if he had lost any property; he said he had lost a watch, value 40l., besides the seals and chain - I did not hear him say it was three hours ago; he might say so, without my hearing him - he was rather in liquor.</p>
               <p>ROGERS. I am a watchman of Saffron-hill. On Saturday night, about half-past eleven o'clock, I saw Birmingham and Kelly at the bottom of Saffron-hill, they spoke to me; at that time Birmingham had a cap on and Kelly a bat; I saw them again about a quarter or half-past twelve nearly on the same spot, and then Redgard was with them; he was dressed as he is now - Birmingham spoke to me then - they went down Field-lane together; at that time Birmingham had the cap on and Kelly the hat - they went down Field-lane together, I saw no more of them till a quarter-past one o'clock, when I saw Birmingham and Kelly in West-street; at that time Birmingham had the cap on and Kelly the hat - they passed me, and in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, I received information that a robbery had been committed in Kirby-street, and the little boy described the prisoners to me - I said I knew them by the description, and in consequence of that description I apprehended Birmingham, Redgard, and Kelly, with the assistance of another watchman - Kelly had then got the cap on and Birmingham the hat.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know Mr. Munro before? A. No.</p>

            . I am a patrol. I assisted in taking Birmingham, Redgard, and Kelly, from the description given by the boy - we took them in West-street; there was another man with them who got away.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Did you know the prosecutor? A. Not before; he went into a wine-vaults in the Old Bailey this morning, alone; I followed him in; he had a small glass of gin and peppermint, there was very little gin in it; I only saw him have one glass - I remained there till he went out; he only had one glass, he wanted another, but I persuaded him not; I said, "We must go over;" he said, "I am very faint, it won't hurt me;" I told him the trial was near coming on, and we must go over; I think he paid three halfpence - a friend who was with him had a glass which made it 4d., but what he drank did not come to 4d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BIRMINGHAM. I should like to ask whether the boy told the watchman I had but one eye, because the watchman came to me and told me he did not think he knew me - and he told the watch-house-keeper he did not think I was one of the men.</p>
               <p>- ROGERS. I do not recollect the boy mentioning to me that one of them had one eye; I told the watch-house-keeper I had seen him twice that night at a quarter-past twelve o'clock, but the robbery was at a quarter-past one, and I could not tell what he had done in that time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner BIRMINGHAM. Q. When you heard of the robbery you never offered to take me into custody when the other two prisoners passed you? Witness. They all three came down the street together, and another who is not taken - they all came out of Black Boy-alley, West-street; that is some distance from Union-court.</p>
               <p>REDGARD's Defence. On the 18th of January, having taken home some goods to Monument-yard, I went back to my father's, and stopped till about ten o'clock, and went to bed - my wife was taken very ill: I was obliged to get up - I got up about half-past eleven, and put on my clothes, without tying my shoes or stockings; I saw Birmingham and Kelly walking down West-street - I came out of Black Boy - alley, where I live, to go and get a quartern of brandy for my wife, and I was taken; I asked what for; and was told a gentleman had been robbed in Hattongarden; I was in bed at the time of the robbery.</p>
               <p>LANGHAM's Defence. When the watchman took me I could have got away if I wanted - I know no more about it than the child unborn; the gentleman said I was not<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190053"/>the man, and when he got to the watch-house, he said he had lost his watch two or three hours ago.</p>

            . I said I would not be sure of him at the first examination, but when I saw him with his hat on, I knew it was him; they had changed their caps - that was a week after; I was then satisfied he was the man - I described him before he was taken, as having a black coat and hat; the man who had but one eye had a cap.</p>

               <p>Prisoner KELLY. On the morning when the girl came to Hatton-garden, she swore she saw me take a cotton handkerchief from the gentleman's pocket, and it was a beautiful moonlight night; she was asked what the colour of the handkerchief was - she did not know; and when the cap on my head was put on Birmingham's head, she said it was him.</p>

            . I am a patrol of Cripplegate. I saw the prosecutor driving his chaise in Redcross-street, opposite Paul's-alley; I saw the prisoner run from the back of the chaise, in the road, and up Paul's-alley - I saw Mr. Giles rise up, and call out Stop thief! Stop him! I then went after him, and got sight of him in the alley - he was running; I then observed a parcel in his right hand, which I had not observed before, as I was on his left side: I stopped him three or four hundred yards off - he had not got the parcel then; I had not seen him part with it - the moment I collared him, he collared me; I said "I will never loose you;" he said "What do you want me for?" I said "You know perfectly well:" he would not go back- another man came, and with his assistance, I got him to the watch-house, and the parcel was produced after I got there; it was claimed by Mrs. Giles, who was in the chaise.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Was not he coming towards you when you took him? A. No; I was not above three yards from him when he first started: I never lost sight of him at all - he ran about three hundred and fifty yards; I met nobody while I was running - Paul's<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190054"/>alley is no thoroughfare; I did not search him, as he said he had got nothing: there are four gas-lights in the court: I was about two yards and a half from him when I saw the parcel under his arm - he was never further from me than that.</p>

            . I am a painter, and live in Bunhill-row. I was coming out of Jackson's-court, which leads into Paul's-alley, and something was thrown before me - some papers flew about, and I thought it might be jewellery - I immediately got a light from a neighbour, looked about, picked up this bundle, and took it to the watch-house; I had heard the cry of Stop thief! about a minute before - the parcel contained two gown pieces; I saw Mr. Giles in his chaise, but did not see the prisoner till he was at the watch-house.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Where did you pick it up? A. In Jackson's-buildings - I suppose I was twenty yards from the cry; the bundle was thrown against my legs, as the person ran by the buildings which lead into Paul's-alley, and almost immediately a person went by after him - he was about twenty yards behind him; it is a dark alley - a person might lose sight of him; I do not think I could distinguish a person twenty yards off, not to swear to him - the alley is one hundred and fifty or two hundred yards long, and Jackson's-buildings about eighty yards up - there are a great many turnings in the direction he went, which I should think would intercept a person's view; there are gas-lights there, but he must be lost sight of in going down the alley; I heard of the prisoner's being taken in about five minutes; I took the parcel to the watch-house.</p>

               <p>JURY. Q. Did you see any body in the court except the man running, and the man in pursuit? A. Several were running in pursuit.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I was going to see a friend in Bethnal-green; on going through Hare-court, leading to this alley, as I turned round by the chapel, a man ran by me, and immediately after the officer ran against me, and knocked me down - I told him a man had run by me, but he took no notice of it; the constable swore at Guildhall that he saw me throw the parcel away into the court on the right-hand side of Paul's-alley.</p>

             re-examined.

            . I am a private street-keeper of Holborn. On the 3d of February I was walking at the end of Drury-lane, in Broad-street; I met the prisoner with this part of a stove on his back, and knowing that it belonged to where the fire had been at the Six Canns, I stopped him; I had seen it lying in the ruins for three weeks- he had got about two hundred yards from the place with it; I said he must go back - he said he was going to take it further; as I was taking him back, he said some man employed him to take it to Monmouth-street, and was to give him 6d.</p>
               <p>Prisoner. I said if you would accompany me to Monmouth-street, I would show you the person. Witness. No, you only said then you were going further; it was not till afterwards that you said you were going to take it there.</p>

I had a bad hand, and my handkerchief was wrapped round it; I did not try to get away - I knew my innocence; on going to Bow-street, I took my hand out of the handcuff, and said "I am innocent;" Herring was not with me - he was merely passing by as a stranger.</p>

            . This is the prisoner's writing - I never received this 5s. 6d. - he never accounted for it in any way; I had discharged him about the 19th of December, and paid him what was due; we settled our accounts; he gave no account of this 5s. 6d. - I discovered it on the 23d of January.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Has not he sometimes detected errors in the accounts, and told you of them? A. Yes he has; I have no recollection of his paying over to me different sums, amounting to 13l. 14s., which were not entered - I had not taken money from him in the street without an acknowledgement, to the best of my knowledge; I should think it could not have happened without my recollecting it; my son receives money of him; I am confident my son did not receive this money of him, because I asked him; he always receives money of him, he is not here.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. How long had he been with you? A. A year and a half, or two years; my receipts did not increase from the time he came into my employ - I did receive a pig from the prisoner's family, but it was not in part of payment or composition of this felony; and I received 1l., but that was on a former account - he was indebted to me 230l. previous to this, and I had forgiven him three times; that was in part of payment of some money he had embezzled previous to this - I cannot recollect the day, but it was in February, and before I had him taken up; I did not send a witness to tell him to abscond - I did not send Tomlin to him; I sent to inform him an officer had instructions to take him, and I told him to get out of the way till the morning, as the officer was not to call on me till the morning; I received the money a day or two before I had him taken -I think it was yesterday week that he was taken; it was from a feeling towards his wife that I sent him word - I know he slept at his own house that night, and was taken up going from that house, about half-past six o'clock in the morning; I sold the pig that was sent me for 28s. - the trough I have still by me; I should be glad to sell that for 4s. - I never said it was worth 12s.; I did receive 1l. besides - I did not tell the prisoner's brother, or his sister, that I would receive 3s. a week from him, nor that I did not wish to injure him, and if he gave me 2s. or 3s. I should be satisfied; his brother had agreed to give me 2l. two or three days previous to my taking him - it might be a week before; I got 1l. from him - I did not blame him for not bringing the other pound, nor appoint to meet the prisoner myself, or send for him; I did not say if he gave me 3s. a week, I would give him a character to another place - I would not do such a thing; I have forgiven him three times before to a considerable amount -I did afterwards take the pound; I sent him word to keep out of the way, as I did not wish to have him taken till the morning.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. When was the first examination? A. I think on Friday week; I repeat the reason I first assigned for sending to him, that I did not wish to lock him up a night longer than was necessary.</p>

            . I am shopman to Mr. Job Townsend and others. On the 10th of February the prisoner came in with another young man, and asked to look at some gloves and handkerchiefs; I left the box of handkerchiefs before them, and went to get the gloves: the prisoner put one piece of handkerchiefs into his pocket - he bought one handkerchief and one pair of gloves; he paid me 5s., and I gave him 3d. change; I then desired him to walk into the back warehouse, and take the piece of handkerchiefs out of his pocket: he denied having it, and I took them out myself; he begged we would let him go and speak to Mr. Townsend - his companion exclaimed that it was a d-d bad job, and went off directly.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. In what position were you when you saw him take them? A. Only getting the gloves - my face was towards him; he did not say he had taken them by mistake.</p>

In 1822 or 1823 the prisoner came into my employ, to attend in the office and go on messages - he left me in October, 1826, I think; he can write but very indifferently - I do not know his hand-writing; in consequence of some communication I received, I gave information at Bow-street, and under the direction of Ruthven, the officer, I wrote this letter, (No. 1); I had previously received this other letter on the 6th, (No. 2); I took my letter myself to King-street, Long-acre, and gave a boy 2d. to take it into No. 31 - I saw him taken it in there; in consequence of receiving one letter, and writing another, I went to the corner of James-street at six o'clock in the evening of the 7th of January; I saw the prisoner there- I went up to him, and said, "Brewer, I have brought you the 10s. you wrote for;" he said, "I will not take it in the presence of a third person:" a young man named Handeside went with me from my office; the prisoner said,"Come round the corner," and I followed him round into Long-acre; I then said to him, "Brewer, how could you send me that letter;" he said, "I am in great distress, but I do not wish to injure you;" I said, "Here are the 10s." - they were in four half-crowns, and he took them from me; in consequence of an arrangement, I then gave a signal to Ruthven, who was immediately on the other side of the way by moving my hat; Ruthven came up, and took the prisoner - he did not take any thing from him in my presence.</p>
               <p>The prosecutor was cross-examined by the prisoner at considerable length, a minute statement of the particulars would be indelicate; he denied having gone with him to Hyde-park and other places, for any purpose; when witness was seriously ill, the prisoner had made tea for him, and he believed had eaten at his table; his wages were 1l. a week - witness had given him a coat, he had attended him at Brighton, when witness had a dislocated arm - witness had never written any letters for the prisoner. When the prisoner was in Clerkenwell prison, for assaulting two boys in Kensington-gardens, witness did not write to him, and knew nothing of three letters produced by the prisoner - he did not allow him 1l. a month while in prison, but had given a Mrs. Sherritt what wages were due at the time he was sent there - he did not know the prisoner had been in the Guards till he had lived some time with him; the prisoner never dined at his house with one Stevens - does not know Captain Hunter, but might have seen him, and never said he was afraid of him; the prisoner might have taken tea with witness when he was laid up; was never at a Police-office, nor ever had a warrant against him; the prisoner had frequently applied to him for money, for relief, and a character; and in consequence of a letter he received he paid 5s. per week for rent for about a month or five weeks, and had given him old clothes once or twice - he never took the prisoner's trunks from his lodging to the French Horn public-house; he never took a double bedded room at the George and Blue Boar inn, nor had the prisoner come into his apartments in Dean-street, or introduce him as Captain Doyle; did not know a person in the regiment, nor any private soldier whatever - had not slept at the George and Blue Bear this ten years.</p>

            . I am an officer of Bow-street.

               <persName id="t18290219-143-person1340">Theatre</persName>
            , this evening at six o'clock, at the corner of James-street, Long-acre, when I will give it you, but it must be for the last time, although your threats I despise. Wednesday.(No 2.) No 31, King-street, Long-acre.</p>
               <p>SIR, - I write mrely to express my surprise at not receiving from you what you promised to send me once a forghnight - I have resrved your note, where you say I might expect to receive it till after Christmas, some weeks; you will have the goodness to send me, by return of post, what you promised, or I shall take those steps that will be very unpleasant to you; it is not my wish to make you uncomfortable - recollect it is your conduct to me that compells me to expose you; you tell me I have no claim on you - the first person I will appeal to is your mother, and after that to the public; you must suppose, sutuated as I am, wanting common necessaries of life, and being turned adrift by you, I am ripe for every thing - it is of no consequence to me; if you can concienessly take steps to injure a man who never injured you, do it as soon as you think proper, and if you do a heavy curse will fall on you: reflect for a moment what has passed betwixt you and me; it was not a day or a month, but for years, and now tell me I have no claim on you, and sey me to even wdnt a meal yesterday - I was without foad the whole of the day - the same to-day; I have nothing to pledge, or I would not have troubled you for the money to pay the doctr; the 10s. did not pay the doctr; if I do not receive the 10s. to-morrow, the ill able, I will walk to your mother's, and will explain every thing to her; it is in your power to prevent it, by sending me what you promised me once a forghtnight - I have your note to prove my assertion; I shall expect an answer to-morrow. I am your's. &amp;c., J. W. STEVENS.</p>

               <p>Mr. Finch, Sollicittor, No. 31, Dean-street, Soho.</p>
               <p>MR. ADOLPHUS to MR. FINCH. Q. Had you seen the prisoner between the time of his being committed to pri<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190061"/>son, and the receipt of this letter? A. Yes, several times; I certainly never promised to send him any thing: I understood by his threatening to expose what had passed between him and me, that he meant to accuse me of an unnatural crime; I had had him to attend me when I had a fistula, and could not have a female.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. What was due to the prisoner? A. Near 20l.; I think it was 18l. odd - the greater part he brought me himself, 5l. at a time.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I know nothing of the letter that was sent to Mr. Finch; I cannot read nor write: I have been in his service, but not as a regular servant, nor regularly employed - I have not been there for three days together in a week; the letter sent to me was brought by a boy; I was obliged to go out to get a person to read it; I did not know who it was from, or what was its contents - I went out, and the first person that accosted me was Mr. Finch; he said, "Do you want me?" I said, "No, Sir, unless you want me;" he said, "Yes; you want the 10s. to pay your rent: "I walked from him - he put the money into my hands; it was taken and produced at the office before the Magistrate: I certainly did make use of the observation that it ought to have been out years ago; I have no witnesses, and I hope you will be merciful to me.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CHURCHILL. Q. Is Mr. Kent here? A. No; he was before the Magistrate, but was not asked any questions; some of these were in a cupboard - some pieces of paper, pieces of string, candlesticks, and other things, were before them - there were shelves in the cupboard; we found brushes in nearly every drawer, and things upon them - many of the brushes we found in his house were not in a state in which he ought to have received them, or to have returned them - they were what we call French polished, and that is done by another man after him; he has a workshop and materials there - I believe journeymen do work for themselves; I have known a man take work from two masters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Does your master ever give out 1375 to work at one time? A. No; I should think the extreme number that is ever delivered out to one man is two gross; we have missed a great deal of property.</p>

            . I am an officer. I was with Schofield when the search was made - what he has stated is correct, I produce twenty-one ivory handles, which I found in one of the drawers in a middle room - only a part of the property is here; there were a great many things - a van load full.</p>
               <p>MR. HICKMAN. I could not identify these handles, but I know some of these brushes, they have Mr. Kent's name on them - I have no doubt they are his; some of them had French polish on them.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Is not this one quite finished, and in a fit state for sale? A. Yes; Mr. Kent sells a great many; I cannot swear that he has not sold this one; here are some unfinished, which I can positively swear were never sold in that state; they ought to have been returned by him to Mr. Kent - these might have been delivered to him.</p>

            . These ivory handles were not delivered to the prisoner - it was a suggestion of Mr. Kent's to have six brushes to one handle - other manufacturers might have had such; this one brush has my writing on it - it was for an Irish order, and we had to make some others to complete the order; I will undertake to swear that these were never delivered to the prisoner; I was the borer of them, and this has my writing on it.</p>
               <p>MR. HICKMAN. These brush-boards were never delivered to the prisoner for any purpose whatever; there are persons who make them on their own account, but it is not the prisoner's trade.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. Do you know the reason why Mr. Kent is not here? A. He is unwell - he has sent his books here, because he wished the prisoner to have every assistance in his power - I do not know that the prisoner is charged with stealing any super satin brushes - are two horse brushes which were never delivered to him, they are out of his line; the prisoner stated they were all his own, and that he made the patterns himself, and they were bored by a man named Griffiths.</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCHILL called -</p>
               <p>MR. CHURCH. I employed Roberts six or eight months ago; I have had an opportunity of forming an opinion of his character; I would not believe him upon his oath.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Why? A. Because he has sold my property and never returned me the money for it; he worked for me, and said he could sell brushes, and I let him have 30s. or 2l. worth, which he sold, and brought the money; I afterwards let him have 4l. worth, he sent me 15s. by his son, and the rest he said his son had lost - that was in June; I did not prefer a hill against him on account of his family, and it is a great deal of trouble and expense.</p>
               <p>MR. CLARK. I am a brush boarder. These boards are nothing mysterious - I can observe nothing particular at all in them except bad workmanship; I do not think any man can swear to them without a private mark on them - I have been in business three years - we cannot distinguish one man's work from another except they are marked - I have known the prisoner about four months - it is not an unusual thing for a brush-maker to make an entire brush on his own account; I should not have been surprised to have found such boards at any brush-maker's shop; it is not uncommon for a journeyman to work for two masters.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Do you know what part of the trade the prisoner's business is? A. I have understood he is a brush inlayer and finisher - there is no hair in these boards; it is not common for a journeyman to have near fourteen hundred brushes, or to keep them in cupboards or drawers; that is not the way I do.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence. I have been employed by Mr. Kent about fourteen years; I worked for him for the first four years, and was than discharged for about six months; Mr. Kent sent for me again, and I have worked upwards of nine years for him; about four years ago I was employed by Mr. Barnes for an order for the East ladies for 100l.; Mr. Hutchinson and Mr. Leigh saw the brushes when they were manufactured; I have since then worked for Mr. Robinson, of Burton; I manufactured brushes out of my old stock, and a great many new ones I bought of Mr. Kent; I had a large stock in hand, and did expect that in a short time I should have started for myself and got rid of it: in the meantime I had been particularly careful in making up accounts at the ware-house; the work was delivered to me before three or four witnesses - I never had an opportunity of purloining one single brush, and every Saturday night or every fortnight I made a clearance of the books; there was not one out against me; I have sent in brushes of my own to make up Mr. Kent's number; I am capable of making brushes of any sort: Griffiths has been in my employ; I invented a machine which he bored with - it was impossible for any one to purloin a single brush out of the prosecutor's premises; I was only admitted there once a week.</p>

               <p>Q. Look at this? A. I know nothing about it; his sister was taken, and he came forward to clear her.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How did you get out of the house? A. When he robbed me he let go of me, and I ran out - he and his friends remained there.</p>

            . I was guard of the Southampton mail coach in December - it passes through Alton. On Tuesday, the 30th of December, about two o'clock in the morning when it passed through Alton, I received the seven mail bags from Miss Camplin - they were on two different straps, but these two straps strapped together; one strap had the Alton and Alresford, Alton and Winchester, Alton and Southampton bags on it - the other strap contained four bags, which were to go below Southampton- when I got on the coach I unstrapped the two straps, and put the three bags which I have named on one strap, and buckled them with twelve other bags; after changing horses at Bishop Sutton, a mile before I got to Alresford, I strapped the bags in three different lots - the Alton and Winchester on the Honnslow and Winchester strap, with the other bags which I had taken up before for Winchester; I had to leave five bags at Alresford, and I took these five bags off at Bishop Sutton, and one of those was the Alton and Alresford; I should have had to leave six bags at Winchester, and those I put together before-between Bishop Sutton and Alresford, I put five of the bags together which I had to leave at Winchester, and the one I had taken up at Alton - I am quite sure I had it in my hand just before I entered the town of Alresford- I mean the bag from Alton to Winchester; I am quite certain of it, for I took it off the strap, and added it to the Winchester strap, and the Southampton bag from Hounslow; I strapped it to four others - as I strapped it, I remembered having only one ring to the bag, and tried with my finger to see if that ring remained safe, and found it was so- the mail reached Winchester about five minutes past four o'clock; I delivered the bags to the post-mistress' son.</p>
               <p>Q. After feeling the ring safe, had you to alter the bags? A. After taking up the Alresford bag, I had to unstrap the Winchester strap on which the Alton and Winchester bag was, in order to put a fresh bag on it - the mail arrived at Winchester about four o'clock, and I delivered the bags to the post-mistress' son, and at that time I believed that the Alton bag was among the number; on my return I understood that the Alton bag was missing; I could not tell where I had dropped it, but suppose it must have been at Alresford in unbuckling the strap, in order to add a fresh bag; Alresford is fifty-eight miles from London.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Whether you dropped it at Alresford, or between that and Winchester. you cannot say? A. No; I am certain I had it at Alresford - it is usual to have two rings to a bag.</p>
               <p>HENRY FLIGHT. I am the post-mistress' son at Winchester. On the 30th of December, I received the bags from Sweatman about four o'clock in the morning - I sorted them when they come in, and on looking them over I missed the Alton and Winchester bag - that was about a quarter of an hour after I received them.</p>

               <p>MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did he give any account of it before the Magistrate, at the first examination? A. Nothing whatever - he denied all knowledge of it till the third hearing, when he held up the pocket-book, and said "This is the pocket-book I found the notes in;" I heard Ward examined at the Post-office, and I believe he said Mason had given the notes to him; he did not say that to the Magistrate till, I believe, the second examination: I did not tell the Magistrate what he had said, nor did Mr. Peacock, in my hearing; I know Mason denied all knowledge of the notes to Mr. Peacock and me, till the third or fourth examination, and he said nothing to the Magistrate about finding them till then - that might be the first time he was asked about them; I cannot say Ward ever gave me any account of the notes, except having them from Mason.</p>

               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Did he, in the country, say one word to you about having any notes? A. No, neither of them; Ward said he knew nothing of any notes at all; he did not speak twenty words from there to town.</p>

            . I am an officer. Melina cottage, where Colonel Gordon lives, is in the parish of Mary-le-bone: on the 15th of January I was fetched there, and while I was talking to the prisoner's mother I found a sword-stick in the trees at the cottage; I observed foot-marks on the border of the garden - there is a wall to the garden; the foot-marks were near the wall, and just near to the trees where I found the stick. On the 22d of January I went to John's coffee-house, at half-past one o'clock, and saw the prisoner; I said,"Good morning to you, Mr. Barton" - one of Colonel Gordon's attendants was in the room; the prisoner went up to him, and said, "Are you Mr. Barton" - he said,"I am;" they shook hands, and the prisoner said, "Do you want me?" Barton said, "No, that gentleman does," pointing to me - I said I apprehended him on suspicion of the robbery at Melina cottage, and that I was an officer; Todd was present, and said, "You must make a mistake, he is a gentleman" - I told him I had made no mistake, he was the man; I then proceeded to search him, and in his right-hand coat pocket I found this bunch of keys, and in his other coat pocket a pocket-book-after I told him he must go with me he said, "You may hang me, or transport me, I am quite tired - I know it is all up;" before that he said he knew he had done wrong towards his mother at the time he left Melina cottage, by taking money from her; when I told him of Colonel Gordon's robbery, and that he must go with me, he said,"Must I walk through the streets with you?" I said Yes- I took a pair of boots off his feet at the office, went to the cottage garden, fitted the boots to the marks in the garden, and near the tree, they corresponded with the marks which were not disturbed at all; I had noticed them on the 15th - I have the key which was in the door, but which did not belong to it; it will unlock, but not lock it.</p>

             re-examined. This is the swordstick - the prisoner was in the habit of walking out with it; I have known it a year and a half to belong to his father, but he used it - these keys are what I left in the portmanteau; part of them belong to Colonel Gordon - these two handkerchiefs are Colonel Gordon's; they were in the portmanteau that night - this one has the Colonel's initials partly on it, and his initials are wholly on the other; this razor is Colonel Gordon's, and was 
left in the portmanteau.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Are you sure there was no access but through that hole? A. Yes; the office joins the inn - there is no communication between the inn and the office but through the yard - it is a large concern; Mr. Edward Sherman is the sole proprietor of the inn, and of all the coaches.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. Do you know what parish it is in? A. It is St. Ann and St. Agnes - the coach office is the place where parcels are deposited.</p>

On the morning of the 4th of September, I went to the Bull and Mouth at a quarter before five o'clock - I saw the floor had been broken, and went into the stable - I found the gas smelt very strong; the stable door was unlocked, and the corn-bin had been removed into the centre of the stable, just under the hole in the floor; a person by the help of the corn-bin could have made that hole; I found in the stable a silk handkerchief and a gimblet - there was a saw found, but I did not find it; I observed something, which proved to be a bag, against the window - it was just break of day.</p>

            . I am a working jeweller, and live in Great Sutton-street, Clerkenwell. I have known Gallawin five or six years; he has carried jewellery about the country for sale - he used to employ me in his trade; on the evening of the 3d of September he called at my house while I was at work - he asked me to write a letter for him; I said, certainly; I had before written on notes for him; I never knew that he could write; I went into my house, and got pen, ink, and paper for him - he pulled out his watch, and said he had a friend to meet at the Bull and Mouth, and asked if I would go there with him and write the letter there - I took some brown paper from home, and got a sheet of white going along; I went to the Bull and Mouth and found the prisoner, who had got there first - we went into the coffee-room, where I wrote a letter according to his dictation; I folded it up - I believe he folded up the parcel, and tied it and sealed it; I directed it to"Mr. Dalrymple, Star and Garter, Worcester, by the Sovereign, carriage paid;" it was dated the 4th of September, 1828, - this is the letter I wrote - (read).</p>
               <p>DEAR SIR - I received your parcel, and sorry I cannot give you the price you ask: the market price is much lower than when I dealt with you before: if you will take off 7 1/2 per cent. I can take the whole lot. your's, Sir, truly,

               <p>Q. How long do you thing you were in the coffee-room? A. I should think from half to three-quarters of an hour - during which time Gallawin went out once or twice; once he went to buy some string, as the waiter had not any - but he did not bring any; after the parcel was sealed and directed, he put it into his pocket; I did not see it again; he told me he was going to take it into the coach-office to book it; I waited at the coffee-room door while he went into the booking-office, and then we went to Williams' coffee-house in St. Martin's-le-grand.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. Is the door of the coffee-room near the booking-office? A. It is on the right-hand side, and the other is on the left - you can see the door of one from the other; I saw him go in, and that was the only time I saw him go in there; he was absent a few minutes at the time he said he went to buy some string - I think four or five minutes.</p>
               <p>Re-examined. Q. I believe you shortly after parted? A. Yes; he gave me a blue bag, and asked me to take it home - I took it to my own house; I saw him again on the Monday following - as near as I can recollect, he said he had a particular favour to ask me; I told him I would serve him in any thing I could - he said he had been making some speculations in business, he was afraid if they proved unfortunate he should lose his little all, and would I be kind enough to take care of two trunks for him - I told him he might put them in the workshop;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190074"/>he said it was not a safe place, as the trunks were valuable, and the workshop was in the yard; he asked if I had a friend a little way from home - I said I had a sister - he had heard me speak of her, no doubt; her name is Haskins - she lives at Shepherd's-bush, and is the wife of Mr. Haskins a jeweller, of Regent-street; he asked me to go down the next day, and ask my sister's leave, which I did; he came the next day for an answer - I got my sister's permission, and told him so; he appointed me to meet him the next morning, which was Wednesday - he called at my house about ten o'clock, and we went as far as Newport-market; I was talking to a person whom I knew in the market, and he said "I will go on to the coffee-shop;" I rather think he said he had had no breakfast; I got to the coffee-shop in about half an hour - it is opposite the coach-stand in the Surrey-road, near the Rev. Rowland Hill's chapel; I found Galloway there - we then went in search of a carter to take away the trunks; we got a cart, after many inquiries, in Tower-street, Westminster-road, of one watling, I think; he did not tell me where the trunks were till after we had got the cart; he then pulled a piece of paper and a pencil out of his pocket, and told me to write down "No. 21, Richardson-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey;" he ran on first, and I and the carter went in the cart together - we overtook him just as we got up to Richardson-street; we saw him tying up his shoe; there is no thoroughfare in the street, and just as we were turning the cart round, I saw him knocking at the door - I saw a man and a tall woman, his wife - I now know that man's name is Garratt; I saw Gallawin. but I do not recollect seeing any other person; he and the carter brought out a small trunk first: the carter said to me, "You must assist with this other," and we all three assisted, and got the large one into the cart; Gallawin gave me a sovereign to pay the expenses on the road - he then went in, and we went away; the trunks were never brought on my premises - the carter and I took them to my sister's, at Shepherd's-bush, and left them there; Gallawin did not go with me; he called in the evening at my house; I told him what expenses I had been at on the road: I think he was waiting at my house when I came back - he then said he should be able to serve me or pay me for my trouble some time; I said I was perfectly satisfied with the way in which he had assisted me in my business: he had been a good customer. I called at Mrs. Haskin's towards the latter end of the month, and she told me she was going to remove further down into the country; I did not tell Gallawin of this. but the trunks remained with my sister till the 26th of september - I then took them to Kensington-square, to the house of Mr.

             Hamston - I frequently saw the prisoner the same as usual; he came to my house in December, and I told him my friend wanted the room in which the trunks were; he begged me to let them remain a week longer, as he did not know what he should do with them; on Sunday evening, the 21st of December, he called again, and said he had engaged with a man to take them away the next morning, and had got a friend who would take them; he appointed to come to me with a horse and cart on Monday morning at ten o'clock - he came into my shop, and went with me to the horse and cart in Goswell-street; one Lloyd was the driver - I had never seen him before; I got into the cart with Lloyd; Gallawin said to him, "Drive on fast Tom, and do as this gentleman directs;" Gallawin did not go with us - I took Lloyd and the cart to the Rose and Crown public-house, just through Knightsbridge turnpike; I left Lloyd there, and went on to Kensington-square; I met my brother there by appointment - I got the trunks from Hamston's; I then came back to the Rose and Crown, at Knightsbridge, where I gave the cart and the trunks in it to Lloyd; I went back, and my brother followed the cart - this was on the 22d of December; I gave Lloyd no direction, for I did not know where he was to take them to: Gallawin had given me no further direction, but to give them to Lloyd - in the evening, Gallawin came to my house much agitated; he said, "Where did you leave that fellow?" meaning the carman with the cart; I told him I had left the man and the cart just beyond Knightsbridge; he said, "At Mr. Davies'? I hope you have not deceived me;" he only sat down a minute; he said, "I am in a great burry - I will take a cabriolet, and see if I can find him;" he said he had somebody with him, but I saw no one - he came again the next evening, which was the 23d, and said, "Mr. Davies, have you heard the news?" meaning the loss of his trunks; I said, Yes, I had seen the account in the newspapers about the trunks being taken; he said, "Oh, it will be my ruin, and it will break my wife's heart;" he said he had eaten nothing all day; he called again in February, a few days before he was taken - it was before the February Session, and on a Monday; he said he was very poor, and wanted money, as they expected him over the water to pay Lloyd for loss of time and expenses.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. ADOLPHUS. Q. You have thought a great deal about this; does it not occur to you that it is the strangest story that ever was heard? A. No, it does not. I knew his family, and he knew mine; he represented this as his own business; I did not know of any speculation - I wrote as he directed; I thought nothing particular of writing a letter in another man's name; I did not know but it was his friend's name - I parted with him that night about eight o'clock; I may have been in the office at the Bull and Mouth to take a parcel or two - I recollect going there many years ago, and only that once that I recollect; it was to take a place in the Union coach to go to Ireland; it must be twenty years ago - it was on the 7th or 8th that he called on me and told me of these two trunks - I had not seen any thing in the newspaper about large property having been taken from the Bull and Mouth; I seldom see a paper - I knew nothing of it; Gallawin represented himself as a jeweller, and I worked for him as such; I knew nothing of his business, but he said he had made a speculation, and must have the trunks put somewhere; I had no supposition as to whether trunks of this size were full of jewellery - I do not know how he traded; it did not strike me as at all strange; I did it to serve him, and to give his trunks house room; my wife saw him at my house, and there was a gentleman named Boyle at my house, who lodged with me - he is gone to America, I believe: he has been gone this four months; if I had been aware, I could tell you exactly the date; I do not know that the prisoner went to Shepherd's-bush while they were there - I went<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190075"/>two or three times, but I did not see the trunks; I went with my brother to fetch them; the prisoner did not go - he trusted all to me; the people at Kensington-square and at my sister's, never saw the prisoner; he hired the cart of Lloyd - I told Lloyd nothing, but to wait while I went to fetch the trunks; I went from Knightsbridge to Kensington-square - the cart could have driven right up to the door, but I left it there; I had no suspicion of any thing wrong - I had no occasion to suspect him; on the 23d of December he came again - I had the good fortune to read the newspaper that day: I did not go to the Stamp-office to tell them all about it; my brother communicated it: I told my brother the dilemma I had got into at that time - that was a few days before they were stopped in the cart; I did not know they were stamps - the dilemma I was in was being acquainted with the prisoner, and having these trunks in my possession; I had no notion of what they contained, but I told my brother I suspected there was something wrong, and advised with him how to act - he said "Leave it to me, and I will act in the best way I can:" I did not know any thing about stamps till they were taken from Lloyd; I dare say my brother made a communication at that time, but I did not; I did know of the robbery at the Bull and Mouth, but not till December; I was living all the time in Sutton-street: I have told the truth as far as I can judge - it was a little time before Christmas, perhaps about the 20th; it was just before Lloyd was taken: a friend of the prisoner's (for whom I had done business) called and told me - I do not know his name, he is a man the prisoner introduced to me; I then told my brother about the dilemma I was in; I proceeded to remove the stamps with the help of the cart, on the 22d of December - I never told a police-officer or a solicitor; I told my brother I received these trunks, and I understood they contained some valuable property belonging to the Stamp-office; that was before I assisted to remove them with Lloyd; I was first spoken to, to tell what I knew, a short time before Gallawin was taken - it must have been the beginning of January.</p>

               <p>Mr. GURNEY. Q. How long before he was taken up did he call on you? A. Four or five days - the person who gave me information was a person who he had introduced to me; he came once or twice, and said if I would give up the property I had in my possession belonging to Gallawin, he should be able to give me a sum of money and at last he said they were stamps belonging to Government, and if I would give them up to him he would give me 500l.; I refused it, and made the communication to my brother - he desired me to leave it to him, and he would do the best the could to get me out of the dreadful scrape I had got into.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. How many conversations had you with this person? A. He came first with a diamond pin to repair, and again two or three days following - that was before he told me the contents; I did not ask his name, and he did not tell me.</p>
               <p>THOMAS DAVIFS. I am brother to Stephen Davies and am a mariner. I assisted my brother in removing some trunks from Haskins' to Hamston's, on a Saturday, I think the 26th of September; on the 22d of December I was at Kensington-square before he arrived - he and I put the trunks into a cart; there was no one in the cart then - I saw him go on the road to Knightsbridge; before that time my brother had told me what he had been informed was in the trunks - in consequence of which I went to the Stamp-office, and gave information to a police-officer; I saw my brother get out of the 
cart at Knightsbridge, and a man got in - I never lost sight of it 
till it was stopped.</p>


               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. You call yourself a mariner, what do you mean by that? A. I mean, the last situation I held was captain's-steward, on board an Indiaman - I went to India; that is three years ago -I have followed ivory-turning, to which I was an apprentice; I was with a brother-in-law, my sister's husband, who had a coffee and smoking room in King-street, Covent-garden - I was a servant or waiter at that Divan, because I had seen hooker smoking abroad, and could put him in the way of it; I had no wages, but perquisites - I have made two voyages to India, both in the capacity of captain's under-steward; I went with Captain Stevens, of the Coldstream Guards, and Captain Drummond, of the Castle Huntley - I had property of my own after my father's decease, to support me since I left my brother; my brother asked me to accompany him to Kensington, and I did - he said what he had to remove was very weighty, and he could not do it himself; I went to see my sister also - I have been in the habit of reading the newspapers frequently, and walking the streets daily - upon my oath I never read or saw any account of the loss of these stamps from the Bull and Mouth till after he asked me to go and remove the trunks; I think it was in the middle of November I saw it in the Morning Advertiser - I never heard of it, or read it before, on my oath; I did not speak to my brother about it when I read it in the Morning Advertiser, to the best of my knowledge -I might in general conversation; I never did, in the month of November, to the best of my knowledge, except in the course of conversation - I never remember saying any thing to him about it; it would not have struck me at all - I mentioned to my brother that I read it in the Morning Advertiser, but not at that time, I am confident; it was not till the stamps were seized at the turnpike - I did not then know what they were, only by information; I never knew what they were: my brother informed me that the boxes were not the property of the party who placed them there.</p>

               <p>Q. Now, do you swear that in that sentence you have given the whole sum and substance of that conversation? A. He told me he had information that the property in those trunks was not the property of the person who placed them there; I give that, upon due deliberation, as the conversation, to the best of my recollection - I had given the information at Somerset-house previous to this; from information received in the first instance from my brother - I had no information from my brother that they were stamps; I did not hear his evidence.</p>
               <p>Q. Then if he has sworn that before the stamps were stopped at Knightsbridge, he had told you the trunks contained property belonging to the Stamp-office, is that true? A. I received information in his presence - he told me he suspected the property in them did not belong to the party who left them.</p>
               <p>Q. Did your brother tell you himself that the property belonged, as he was told, to the Stamp-office, before the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190076"/>stamps were stopped at Knightsbridge? A. My brother told me that he had information that the property in these boxes was the property of the Stamp-office - there was no other person present when he told me so.</p>


               <p>Q. Who was the third person whom you said was present that gave you the information? A. I never saw him - I was hidden while he was giving information to my brother: I think my brother told me that he supposed this property belonged to the Stamp-office, the day before the person gave him the information in my presence - it was the latter end of November, or beginning of December; it must be in December; not a week - not many days before they were stopped; my brother first told me he suspected the property contained in the trunks did not belong to the person who placed them there, and he should be told by the person what they were; he said that person was a friend of Gallawin's, and he had done several jobs for him, being introduced by Gallawin - I do not recollect that he told me how long he had known him; I told my brother I considered he had got into the hands of villains, who would try to make a dupe of him, but I would secrete myself, and get what information I could from him - my brother knew I was hiding; my brother asked him first what he supposed the property to be, and he said he would give him a sum for it; my brother asked what he supposed them to be - he said Gallawin was a rogue, and he would make a dupe of him, and the sooner he got rid of those things that he had in his possession the better - my brother said, "What property is it? - you must know, as you seem to have such a wish for it;" he then said, "I will not keep you longer in suspence," or words to that effect, "They are stamps belonging to the Stamp-office," and he would give him 500l. if he would place them in his possession; my brother then said, "It is a serious thing - I little expected any thing of this sort; I cannot give you an answer now, I will see you to-morrow" - I do not recollect any other conversation; he went away; I do not recollect his expressing his surprise at the robbery at the Stamp-office; I do not think he did - if he asked him what stamps they were, it has escaped my memory; this was about a week before the stamps were stopped at Knightsbridge - I did not know from my brother that it was not till after the stamps were stopped, that he read in the newspapers what they contained; I asked this person's name, and he told me he did not know his name - my brother did not ask him his name at that time - I never was in his presence but that once, to my knowledge; I never knew my brother any thing but a jeweller - situated as I was, I did not know how to act; this took place in my brother's work-shop - I could have seized the man; when my brother told me he was to meet him the next day, I said, "Let me he present, and if you will leave it to me I will consider how best to act" - I therefore thought it would be better not to take the parties, but give information at the Stamp-office; I knew my brother had two trunks, and what this man had said, but I did not then know what was in the trunks.</p>
               <p>MR. GURNEY. Q. But you watched them till the officer took them? A. Yes.</p>

I have known Gallawin between five and six years - he came to my husband on the 3d of September; they went out together: before my husband went out, he asked me for some paper - I had not heard any particular request which the prisoner made to him, only he asked him to bring him some paper; when my husband came home that night he brought a bag, with a great coat in it - in a day or two after the prisoner called, asked for Mr. Davies, and asked me for the bag that he gave Mr. Davies; I gave it him, with the great coat in it - I frequently saw him at my husband's, between that time and the 21st of December; on the evening of the 21st of December I saw him at the door, and they had some conversation, but I do not know what it was - next morning, the 22d, I saw him again; he and my husband went out together - he came back the same evening, and appeared much agitated; he came in very quick, and said, "Mr. Davies, that fellow has not come back yet - I have been waiting all day for him, where did you leave him?" my husband said"Opposite the Rose and Crown, below Knightsbridge, about one o'clock, with the horse, cart and trunks, quite safe;" he said he would go down the road, and see if he could hear or see any thing of him - this was about six o'clock in the evening; he then went away, and I saw him the next evening - he came and asked Mr. Davies if he had heard the news; he said, "Yes, I have seen it in the newspaper."</p>

I know Sewell ever since I was at school - we are no relations that I know of, but I have known him nearly thirty years; he called upon me in September last, I think, but I cannot be quite certain - he said a friend of his, or a person he knew, wanted to save a few things, and would I take care of them, or allow them to be brought to my house; I assented to it, and wanted to know when they would come; he did not seem rightly to know - I think they came the following morning, about eight o'clock, as near as I can recollect; he was at the door when I opened it - there was a vehicle, whether a cart or a chaise-cart I cannot say; it was drawn by one horse - there were two other persons with Sewell; I do not know whether there were any more - I did not know those persons then; I was not dressed; having opened the door, I ran back to my room, took the key, opened the front door, and<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190077"/>pushed it open for them to put whatever they brought in- I slept in the back room: I did not at that time see what they brought in; I went to dress myself - when I returned I saw Sewell, and either be or one of the other parties said something to me - I cannot say positively who it was; I afterwards went into the room, and saw there were three largish parcels - they might be the size of this parcel, or smaller; they were not larger - they were in what I should call a sack, as if you took a sack and wrapped them up; one stood on the other two, on the top of my little drawers, and the size of this one makes me think that they would not have lain very comfortably on my drawers, as they are but small ones - I saw the parcels again the week following; a person then came to my door, and when I opened it, I recollected him to be one of the persons who came when the things were brought; in consequence of what he said I expected something to be brought, and a large trunk came, which was taken into the front room; I did not see any thing done with it, but when I came into the room again there were two trunks, and from the disappearance of the parcels I supposed they were put into them; Sewell came afterwards, and I told him that these things were going to be removed, or something to that purpose - I took him to the front room, and, to the best of my recollection, the person who came first was then cording the trunks; he went away, and Sewell remained with me; after that a cart came to the door - the person had been gone but a very short time; I thought he went for some persons, or for a vehicle, but he did not come with the cart; three persons came - I cannot swear whether Gallawin was one; my belief is that he was a young man - I cannot swear that he was the man- I did not know either of the other men: there are two men who say they are the men - I now know Stephen Davies, but if he had not told me he was one, I should not have known him; these things were put into the cart by the carter and Stephen Davies - the cart was driven away; one of the men remained a few moments, and took a lunch with us - whether one or two lunched, I cannot be certain; I was going out, and there was a bit of lunch on the table.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. How long have you been a painter? A. Fifteen years, ever since I was first apprenticed - I never was a tailor, nor represented myself as such; I could not recollect at first whether this might not be in October - I now think it must be September, but am not certain: I think it is within this fortnight that I first told of Sewell calling on me; I went to the Stamp-office, but it was not there I told it- I told it to a gentleman, whose name I believe is Mr. Tebbs; I was sent for by an officer of Queen-square - I remember Maltwood and Woodberry being examined; I was asked to put my hat on, and I did - I did not know Maltwood before that morning, when we passed him with the officers, and they spoke to him; I have bought a trunk of Maltwood - I once lived at No. 12, Kennington-lane; I have been at Bow-street - I was at Bow-street once on a charge; I will swear I have not been there half a dozen times - it is a long time ago; I do not recollect having been there since, not lately - if it was a long time back I should recollect it the better.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever been at Union-hall on your own account? A. I do not recollect; I do not recollect ever being charged with uttering bad money at Union-hall; I have been in Horsemonger-lane, but not as a prisoner, only as a visitor - I do not think I ever was within the gates of Cold Bath-fields prison; I never was there for six months.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you the person who goes by the name of Jem Green, or

               <p>Q. Well, that was one occurrence; were you ever at Bow-street alone, or without John Smith? A. I recollect once, but I was discharged; somebody had lost a pocket-book - that was about the same time as the other; I do not recollect when the third charge was - I was there another time, but I was not put to the bar; I do not recollect any more - I believe that was the last; it may be half a dozen years ago - it is more than two years - I do not think I have been in Bow-street office these two years; the last time I went with a woman, but I was not put to the bar, nor any charge made against me - I was taken there with a person I was in company with; I was not examined as a witness - they seemed as if they did not want me, and I went away again; they merely told me I must go along with them - the woman was charged with stealing a watch; I still mean to swear I never was charged at Union-hall.</p>

               <p>Q. Have you since that time been a dealer in dead bodies? A. No, I never have to my knowledge; I may have been to St. Bartholomew's-hospital with persons who died afterwards - I have been there, and at other hospitals, and there might have been dead bodies there.</p>
               <p>Q. But were you not there selling them? A. I do not suppose I am the same person you mean; I may have had the money produced from such things, but I never sold<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="182902190078"/>them - I cannot exactly say how often I have sold such a thing myself.</p>

            . I am the wife of the last witness. -In September last I remember three parcels coming to my house - I saw them in the evening; they were similar to this, but I think not quite so large - they were all the same size, within a little: I know the person who calls himself Sewell - his name is Greenwood; I have known him twenty years, I believe. I saw the three parcels on a small chest of drawers behind the door: they were there till some time in the next week - I remember a sort of square box or trunk coming while they were there - I was not at my own door when it was taken in; I went in while it was there, with a small latch-key, and went to the other room - I saw the trunk when the persons came to the door; I only saw one, but when they were ready there were two: I did not see Mr. Sewell that day till they were ready to go - there were three men with the cart; Mr. Davies was one of them, as I have heard, but I did not know him: I opened the door to a young man, but cannot say whether it was Gallawin - I cannot recollect him; I have been shewn him before, but it seemed to me to be a younger man - I cannot swear that it was not him; the trunks went away directly, in the cart, Mr. Davies (as they call him) and the carter went away; the young man put on his hat, and he and Greenwood went away - they did step into the back room, to a bit of lunch; they did not sit down - one, if not both, took a bit after the trunks were gone; I did not see any more of the young man - I did not see Greenwood again till I saw him at Queen-square.</p>

On the 10th of September I was out with it, and when I came home I was told there had been some persons about moving some trunks; I went over the way, and saw Gallawin and Davies - I think, to the best of my recollection Davies asked me if I could move some trunks. but the other was with him, and I said I could - I think Davies said I must go immediately, as they had got two trunks, and wished to meet a gig at Tyburn - I think Gallawin asked me the price; I could not say any thing to that till I saw the trunks: I was ordered to put too immediately, which I did, and when I had put too. Davies got in - he had in his hand a piece of paper, with No.21, Richardson-street on it - whether Bermondsey was on it or not I cannot say; I did not know where Richardson-street was, and Davies did not appear to know; we stopped, and inquired at a butcher's-shop - we went to No. 21. Richardson-street, Long-lane, Bermondsey; we saw Gallawin just outside, stooping tying up his shoe, or something - when we got to No.21, I saw Gallawin in the passage of the house; I cannot be positive whether Davies had then got out or not- when I let down the tail-board Davies told me they were the trunks I was to take; Gallawin was at that time in the house - Davies was not and I saw a female there: I do not know her only by what she says, and I saw Mr. Garratt; Gallawin and I got the small trunk into the cart first- it was partly in the passage: I went into the parlour, and found the other trunk was heavy; I called Davies to help me, and Gallawin - we all helped it in, and I think Garratt helped, but I am not certain; I put the tail-board up, and Davies got in - I drove off to Shepherd's-bush, where we left the trunks, at a cottage: these trunks which are here resemble those I took.</p>

             - we had a cottage at Shepherd's-bush; I had two trunks brought there in September last - my brother had spoken to me about them before; I think on the 8th or 9th he asked if I would have two trunks brought there, and they came on the 10th; I was not at home, and did not see them come, but I came home before they were taken out of the cart - my brother and a man who I think was Watling was with him; they remained in the same state till the 27th, I think, when they were taken away by Stephen and Thomas Davies.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Which of your brothers asked you to take charge of them? A. Stephen - he said they were for a friend of his; he did not say any thing about their containing valuable property - they were placed in a public room: he did not tell me they contained the all of a dear friend - they were in the room where my servant slept, and no particular care taken of them.</p>

               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. Have you known Davies long? A. About thirty years: Stephen said they belonged to a friend of his, and asked me to let them be there; he did not say they were valuable, nor tell me to put them in any particular safe place.</p>

I know Stephen Davies and the prisoner Gallawin - I have frequently seen him at Davies' house; I believe Gallawin is a travelling jeweller; I have always considered him as such; I have seen him at Davies on that business; I saw Gallawin at Davies' on the Monday before Christmas day, about ten o'clock in the morning: Stephen Davies was in the shop when Gallawin came in; they both went from the shop with me into the house, staid a few minutes, then returned into the yard, and were in conversation there; Gallawin then came into the shop, and Davies went into the house; he was absent a little while, and then came again with his coat off into the shop; he brought some work into the shop; Gallawin told him to make haste, or they should be too late- Davies then went into the house, returned in a few minutes, and they both went away together.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. PHILLIPS. Q. When were you first asked about all this? A. About three weeks ago, I was sent for - I have a house of my own, and work for Davies sometimes; I recollected the time, because there was a silver dessert spoon lying on the place - Gallawin took it up, and asked me if it was not a good one.</p>

On the 24th of January the prisoner came to my shop, a little before seven o'clock, and purchased two herrings, for which she gave me one shilling; she had been at the shop about five weeks before, and purchased one in the same way for 1 1/2d. - she did not pay at the time, but called afterwards and paid for it with a bad half-crown, which I had marked, and put by to give her; I mentioned it to her on this occasion, but before I mentioned it she had given me a good half-crown in exchange for the shilling which I had objected to, and when I mentioned about the other half-crown, she said if she had given me a bad one it was unknown to her, and she was willing to exchange it; I saw a purse in her hand, with six or seven good half-crowns in it - she afterwards produced 2 1/2d. or 3d., which she laid on the counter; the patrol was passing, and I gave her in charge - she said if I would let her go she would give me 5s.; I marked the shilling and half-crown, and gave them to the officer.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined by MR. CLARKSON. Q. Did you give her into custody before you got the good half-crown for the bad one? A. No - she gave me the good half-crown for the shilling that I said was bad; I did not see her searched; I afterwards saw the money that was in the purse - I think there were seven good half-crowns; she had a basket, and told where she bought the articles that were in it - I went with the officer, I think, to four places; I found a bad shilling at Brown's, in Cheapside - on going from the watch-house to the Compter she threw away a paper, which I picked up.</p>
               <p>MR. BOLLAND. Q. What was that? A. A small bottle of some sort of scent, and from that I went to Mr. Brown's.</p>

            . This half-crown is counterfeit, and these two shillings - they are all of the same metal; the two shillings appear to be from the same impression, and from the same plaster of Paris mould - they are certainly not from a die, for here are the marks of the air-bubbles, which prove they are not from a die.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Are you sure that it is not from a die? A. Yes - they are made of what is generally called Queen's metal.</p>
               <p>MR. LAW. Q. How long have you been in your capacity? A. Almost all my life - it is necessary to state, that the impression on the moulds, from which these are made, is from a good shilling.</p>
               <p>COURT. Q. So far, the mould would furnish a better impression than a die? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>JURY to MR. JACKSON. Q. Had the prisoner enough to pay for the herring without exchanging the shilling? A. Yes; she laid the first bad half-crown down to me, and I slipped it along - my wife gave her 2s. 4 1/2d; I had marked the half-crown, and kept it for her.</p>

               <p>Prisoner. Q. Have you not requested me to watch the place before? A. No; I never said the boy was dishonest and had robbed his parents; I have said he was a bad little boy for stopping on his errands - I never said I could not trust him to bring home money; I have found him deficient in a halfpenny or so; but I never said so to the prisoner.</p>

               <p>COURT. Q. Was that with respect to the whole of them? A. Yes; he said he had got them out of a writing-desk, with a key, which he had lost.</p>
               <p>Cross-examined. Q. You have stated that he several times denied it? A. Yes; I said, "Tell me the truth, the truth will always support you, and carry you through;" I said, in the first instance, with regard to the dressing-case, that he had better tell the truth - that was before he had made any confession to Mr. Gandolfe; Mr. Gandolfe had discovered the case in his room, and I told him he had better tell the truth; I said, "I will intercede with Mr. Gandolfe, and I dare say he will not take any measures with you - tell me the truth." I said nothing in referrence to any other article.</p>
               <p>Q. After he had been dismissed did you see him again? A. Yes. before he made any confession; I told him a watch and various things were missing - nothing but the dressingcase had been found then; I said, "With regard to the watch, tell me the truth - have you had that watch, or do you know any thing about it or the medicine-chest?" he said he did not; I will swear I said nothing to him but charging him to tell the truth, and not to give me trouble by telling me falsehoods; I am certain I did not hold out a promise, perhaps I might have said it would be better.</p>

Twenty years - it is part of my business to know silver from metal; I opened the papers - there was no stamp on the metal to indicate that it was silver; I could have discovered it in the first instance - I was deceived in it; he stated it was silver.</p>
               <p>JURY. Q. Is it not the practice of your trade to keep aquafortis? A. Yes, and I have tried some pieces, but pewter will have the appearance of silver when tried with it.</p>
