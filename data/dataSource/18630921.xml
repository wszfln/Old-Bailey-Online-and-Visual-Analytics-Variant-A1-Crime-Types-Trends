                  </hi>. I am clerk to Mr. Austin, one of the messengers of the Bankruptcy Court—I produce the papers in the defendant's first bankruptcy; also in his second bankruptcy in May, dated 27th May, 1863—the petition<lb/>ing creditors are John and Issac Wilson—I have also the adjudication of bankruptcy signed by Mr. Commissioner Fane on the same day, and the ap<lb/>pointment of Isaac Wilson as trade assignee on 23rd June—the bankrupt did not surrender on that day—I have the certificate of the Commissioner to prosecute, on 8th August—the amount of debts proved on 22nd July, in<lb/>cluding Messrs. Wilson's, was about 740<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—there are no accounts filed.</p>

Good and Law, 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—there is nothing re<lb/>presented on the other side as assets—the first meeting, of creditors was appointed for 22nd or 23rd June—I am not aware that the bankrupt was in custody then—I saw at the place at Southampton-street Mr. Toovey, who purchased the business—I asked him if the bankrupt was there and, sought to get information from him relative to Mr. Behrens—I do not know how long Toovey had been in possession at that time.</p>

                  </hi>. I am cashier to the petitioning creditors, John and Isaac Wilson, and live at their establishment at 116, Wood-street—they are wholesale hosiers and warehousemen—I know the prisoner—on 16th April I saw him at my employers' premises—his account was then overdue—he had then returned from Cologne—I called his attention to his account, stating that we should require it to be settled—he said he would call in a day or two—he did not call—I next saw him at Southampton-street, Cam<lb/>berwell, I believe, on Monday, 27th or 28th April; no, I must correct my<lb/>self, it was on 6th May—I saw him in bed—I had not been there before—I told him I had come for the account; I was very much disappointed that he had not called according to promise—he said he expected to get some money—he complained of being very unwell—he seemed to be very ill, but I think</p>

Wilson—I swear that; it never came to my knowledge until he was gone—I never knew that he was about to sell it—it was an ironmongery and tin ware business—we did not know that the goods sup<lb/>plied were not going to that shop—he told me the goods were for the German trade—he did not tell me he was going into Germany with the goods and get orders for them; he said they were for his customers over there—it was not in November that he told me that; it might be in the beginning of the year, January—he said he was going abroad with them—he told me he was going over to the fairs in Germany—I don't remember that he mentioned any particular fair—he might have mentioned Leipsic—I will not swear he did not—he told me on 16th April that he had been there—the last purchase before 16th April was on 13th March—he paid 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. on that day—the amount of the order that day was 29<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 14<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I do not serve in the warehouse—I saw him on that day—I can't say whether Mr. Wilson saw him; I don't suppose he did—he did not then tell me that he was going to Germany with these goods—he told me, on 16th April, that he had been to Germany—he did not say the market was not as flourishing as he expected—he said nothing about his success or want of success—he said he should go over again in the course of a few days—I do not remember his telling me, when I saw him at his own house, that if it had not been for his illness he should then have been in Germany—I will not swear he did not—I don't think I said anything to him about Germany—I mentioned the account—he said he had been dis<lb/>appointed in some remittance—he never told me that, instead of selling a large quantity of goods, as he expected, he had only been able to sell 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. worth—he did not tell me that there were other kinds of goods which he found more suited to the market, which he intended to take over with him when he returned—I did not see him on all occasions when he called—the salesman in the house took the order from him—there may be a dozen sales<lb/>men—they are not here that I am aware of—I was not present at any con<lb/>venation between Mr. Thomas Wilson and the prisoner after his return from Germany—I never heard Mr. Wilson say that he had not expected him back for three months—the last payment was on 30th March—nothing was paid in May; he was gone on 6th May—there is a person named Saunders in our employment—this receipt for 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.

I think he said, and that was the only reason he stayed with him—he told me that he was going by the boat with the goods, and asked me what time she would leave, and what hour it would be neces<lb/>sary for him to be at the wharf; he then left, and I saw no more of him—that was the only transaction I ever had with him—he did not pay the freightage—I settled the charges on the goods in the usual manner, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 1—they were consigned to J.

                  </hi>. I am one of the detectives of the City of London—I first received instructions with reference to the prisoner about the 10th or 11th May—I went over to his place in Southampton-street, Camberwell—I found the name of Toovey over the door; it appeared to have been recently painted up—on 12th June, armed with a warrant from the Commissioner of Bankruptcy—I went abroad—on Tuesday, 23rd June, at a town called Ehrenfeld, near Cologne, I saw the prisoner at a public-house—he had not so much whiskers then as he has now; they were just sprouting out—he was first spoken to by a German officer—I could not understand what he said to him—I told him I was an officer from London, and that I held a warrant for his apprehension for absconding from London and defrauding his creditors—he said, "Oh, nonsense, that can't be; I was coming over to<lb/>morrow to settle with them"—I raid, "That appears very curious to me, for you were at Gravesend on Sunday, the 21st—he said, "Oh, well, I was coming over to settle with them to-morrow"—he was then taken to the burgomaster's office, and there I searched him—I asked him whether he had any other property; he said "no"—I asked what he had done with the proceeds of the property he had brought from England—he said he had not got a shilling in the world—I asked him where he lived—he told me at No. 6, Cecil-street, Ehrenfeld, which was two or three streets off the public-house where I found him—on searching him I found twenty-three thalers and a silver watch, which I returned to his wife, because she had no money—I went to Cecil-street, where he directed me, and in a top room, which had been fitted up with boarding and shelves, I found eighteen rolls of cocoa-nutmatting, three pieces of Dutch carpet, and a quantity of other things—I have an inventory of them—it was made in my presence—I assisted in making it. (<hi rend="italic">This was read in part; it consisted of carpet, mats, hearth-rugs, railway-wrappers, opera and race glasses, coloured silk handkerchiefs, scarfs, and other goods</hi>) I received six bills of exchange from his wife at the same time—I gave them up to Mr. Gammon, the solicitor—these (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>) are four of them;</p>

               <p>two have since been paid—the prisoner was taken by the police to the prison at Ehrenfeld, and I saw him there—I told him I had found the goods—he asked me what I had done with them—I said I was going to send them to London—he said that was quite right, for all the goods I found at his house were the property of his creditors in London—while I was in the prison with him he said, "I have got a gold watch and chain if I tell you where it is will you let me have it?"—I said no, I could not do that, because it became the property of the creditors—he said, "Then I shall not tell you where it is"—I afterwards discovered where it was, and took possession of it, and brought it to England—I have it here—I asked him where the books of account were—he said they were in possession of Mr. Toovey, of Southamp<lb/>ton-street, the man he sold his business to—I have two bank-books, which were given up; they represented money deposited in that town, and that money I got out and took possession of—I also recovered a quantity of mats deposited with a person of the name of Walsach, which I sold for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. less 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. discount—here is the invoice of them—I did not bring any of those back; I brought back all that I found in Cecil-street, and have shown them to Mr. Bowen, Mr. Seyd, and Mr. Bennett—I produce sundry papers and documents which I found in Cecil-street—on the voyage home in the Batavier the prisoner said he was glad I had not found the watch—I said, "Are you?"—he said, "Yes, because my wife has got it I believe"—he was not correct in that, because I had got it—I produce an agreement for the house in Cecil-street—the prisoner stated, "I came over here, and I have taken this house in Cecil-street for three years, and had it fitted up and the gas put up.</p>

I am an ironmonger, of 2, Southampton-street, Camberwell—previous to the 6th May I had been some years out of business—I saw the prisoner about September or October last, and had some transac<lb/>tions with him in purchasing articles at his shop as a customer—I am now carrying on the business that he was then carrying on—I first had conversa<lb/>tion with him about taking his business some time in April, I should think previous to the 15th—I negotiated with him on that and other occasions, and it resulted in my becoming the purchaser on 5th May—he was not in Cam<lb/>berwell at that time—I was aware of his leaving London, and I understood from his wife that he had gone to Liverpool—the last time I saw him at</p>

               <p>Camberwell was on 27th April—on 5th May, when I settled with his wife, I gave her four bills—these produced are three of them—the first bill was for 40<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at ten or fifteen days, and the others for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. each at four, eight, and twelve months—the one at ten days I have paid to the assignees—I paid 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for the business—when I accepted the bills I gave them to the prisoner's wife, and I subsequently received this document from her, I should think ten days or a fortnight after I had given the bills and been in possession of the business—I caused my own name to be put up—the prisoner had told me that he could make more money by travelling on the Continent, by purchasing things in England and selling them there as a commercial traveller—on 27th April, the last time I saw him in London, he had a beard, about the same that he has now.</p>

I gave him sixpence a pound for it"—it is worth a shilling a pound at least—it is grease now—it is not in the state in which it left our place—it was what is called "spent pomade" when it left our place—Smith then asked him if he had any other tins on his premises—he said no, he had not—he said, "We must search your premises"—I went with him, and we found about a dozen tins, some of them exactly the same as this one—the prisoner then called his wife down, and said, "Here are some sheriffs' officers come about that matter of Sparke's last night"—Smith said they were not sheriffs' officers, they were detectives—Smith then asked her some questions, and the prisoner told her to hold her tongue, and not answer—Smith asked the prisoner if he weighed the fat when he bought it—he said he had not, there was thirteen pounds—he said he knew Sparkes was in our employment and had known him some time—we have a great many cans of this sort in our place, which are sometimes full and sometimes empty.</p>

                  </hi>. I keep a coffee-shop, at 198, Pentonville-road—on 27th August, about 5 o'clock, the prisoner came for a cup of tea and two slices of bread and butter; they came to 2 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he gave me a bad half-crown—I walked to the other end of the shop, and showed it to a gentleman, who also pronounced it bad—I asked the prisoner where he got it—he said, "Why?"—I said, "It is bad"—he said, "I got it at a pawnbroker's shop"—I said, "Have you any more about you?"—he said, "No;" and asked to look at it—I refused, and sent for a policeman—Mr. White, who was sitting in the shop, took it out of my hand to look at it, and the prisoner jumped up, snatched it from him, put it into his pocket, and said that he would go and fetch a policeman himself—I said, "You will not go out of here"—he then ran through my house, and I ran after him—he passed the kitchen fire, and passed the water-closet into the back yard, returned again, and I met him at the door—two policemen then came, one to the front door, and one to the back, and I gave him in custody—I looked for the half-crown, but could not find it—I am quite sure it was bad—I tried it on a table.</p>

I live at 68, Southampton-street, Pentonville—I was at Mr. Stevens' coffee-shop, and saw the prisoner give him a half-crown—it was afterwards given to me to examine, and while I was looking at it the prisoner snatched it away and put it in his waistcoat pocket—he wanted to leave the room, but Mr. Stevens put his back against the door—the prisoner then ran up the shop and tried to get out at the back—I am confident that the half-crown was bad.</p>

                  </hi>. I am manager of the Royal Liver Friendly Society—the trustees of that society are Mr. Gregg Rathbone, Mr. Rawlins, and Mr. M'Gregor—the prisoner has been in the employment of that society for about five years and a half—his duties were to go round and collect the mem<lb/>bers' subscriptions, and bring them to the office in New Bridge-street—that was the course of duty prescribed for him by the rules of the society—he has acted by those rules during the time he has been in the employ—he was paid a nominal salary of 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week, and 25 per cent for collect<lb/>ing—his earnings at the present time averaged about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. or 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. a week—when a collector commences in our society his duty is to solicit parties to become members, and when they are enrolled his duty is to call upon them once a week, or once a fortnight at longest, and receive their subscriptions; to place on their cards the amount he receives, and also to enter the same amount in corresponding columns in a book—the cards are held by the members as their receipt and claim on the society—on 28th July he has entered on Russell's card 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received, and in the book it is only 6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—on 11th August he has entered 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received from Kidd, and on Kidd's card 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. SLEIGH</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How long have you been connected with this society? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> About two and a half years—I was previously connected with a kindred society in Liverpool—at the time I joined this society Mr. Swann was the chairman, and he is now—it was not he who gave the prisoner into custody; I believe it was Mr. Liversedge—he is not here—he was before the Alderman, but was not examined—I was present when he was given in charge—before that I told him that his accounts were not cor<lb/>rect</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186309210021"/>
               <p>—he did not reply, "Well, that may be so, but I am quite willing to go over them, and to call upon any of the members you please"—he at first refused to go with me—he did not offer to go over his accounts with me; he offered to call on any of the members—I told him to go to the nearest—I opened the books, and said "Now, let us go to these"—amongst them were Kidd and Russell—the prisoner accompanied me there—the name of "John Murphy" on these cards is the prisoner's writing—the amounts he receives are entered in figures—the cards are printed for every Monday—the 27th July was on a Monday, but he received Russell's money on the 28th, and in the same way with Kidd's—these books are in the prisoner's writing—6 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered to Russell on the 27th July—Kidd's is in the same book—they live in the same street—these payments are made fortnightly—the clo<lb/>lector collects every day, and is bound to pay in the money he receives every week, on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday—the prisoner always paid his money in on Friday—he would hare to collect from about 1,200 names during the week, all in small amounts of 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. or 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—that ought to be done without mistake, and we expect it to be so—I have not yet found that any of the collectors have ever made a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> mistake—I have been a collector; I was a collector at Liverpool—I never made a mistake while I was a collector there to my knowledge—I am not aware that it was ever alleged—I believe every book I held corresponded with my cards, as every collector's ought to do—I was with the Liverpool Society in 1860—I left them in 1860—there was no allegation of any mistake on my part—I left them to come over to this society—the Liverpool Board of Management heard that I was coming here, and demanded all my books—I believe the party who is the instigator of these questions is the man that got me dismissed, Mr. John Lawrence—the managers did not complain of my mode of collection; they complained of my not paying over the money to them—I did withhold the money until I was satisfied about turning over to the Liver Society, and I withheld the books also—that was made the subject of inquiry in a court of justice, and they punished me for refusing to give up the books—I was not convicted of embezzling the money of the society—I do not owe them a farthing, nor did I when I left—I was charged with the money that I held up to the time of appearing in court—I believe it was a criminal proceeding—I was indicted—the result was a penalty of 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or three months' imprisonment, according to the Act of Parliament—I did not pay the fine, I suffered the three months, and I would again—there was no charge of any wrong entries—I did not know the prisoner at that time—when I came to the London Society the Board of management here appointed me—Mr. Stevenson was then the secre<lb/>tary, he is now the treasurer, and secretary too, I believe; he is not the pre<lb/>sident—I am the manager of the London district—I do not receive 25 per cent, on the collection—the collectors, on obtaining new members, are per<lb/>mitted to retain the whole of the first six weeks' subscription; that is, besides the 25 per cent.—that is supposed to be an equivalent for getting the new member—I am paid by a salary—the secretary and treasurer are paid in the same ratio—I do not know what they get; their salary is appointed by the general public meeting.</p>

               <p>Society—he is not now—he has been dismissed, and now he wishes this to be brought before the public for the benefit of the society with which he is now connected—notwithstanding the charge made against me, I was appointed by the management of the Liver Society, with a full knowledge of what had occurred in the other society—the sums which the prisoner is charged with taking from Kidd were not part of the first six weeks' subscrip<lb/>tion; he has been a member two or three years.</p>

                  </hi>. On 21st April the prisoner has entered in his book 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. as received from Keziah Russell, 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Francis Russell, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mr. Sargeant, and 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. from Mrs. Sargeant—on 19th May and 16th June exactly the same sums are entered—those were the sums he paid over—there are a great number of other sums that are incorrectly entered—on 11th August 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered to Francis Kussell, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Keziah, 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Thomas Sargeant, and nothing to Mary Ann—on that same date on their cards 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered to Francis and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Keziah Russell, 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Thomas and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Mary Sargeant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Is each entry in respect of one week's subscription? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> A fortnight's—there is a cipher every other week—the fortnight's sub<lb/>scription is entered in the aggregate in one entry—it ought to be so—this is the book which he kept for the last five weeks—the previous book was kept in exactly the same way—I had this book from him week after week—the entry in each column is in respect of each individual week, although on the card the fortnight's subscription is entered—we never corresponded the cards with the book; we could not, the cards were held by the members—the bock was only before me while he paid the money in—I saw that the sums were entered as weekly sums, not as fortnightly—it ought to be entered here the same as it is on the cards—he ought to collect every week, but he had the option of going once a fortnight—it would be his duty to enter in the book exactly the same date and amount that he enters on the card—he was taken into custody on 17th August—in the column for the week ending August 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., there is a blank; on the 10th there is entered 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Francis Russell, and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. to Keziah—if he had received the whole of that amount, 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., on the 10th, it would not be his duty to enter 4<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. in the column of the 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., because the amount is given over in the office; he would give in his money for the week, he cannot back date it—on 27th July, 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. and 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. is entered to the Russells, and the same sums the week preceding—he had no right to do so—he did wrong by doing so—during the whole of the keep<lb/>ing of this book, he has acted in contravention of his duty in putting these sums into the weekly columns.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ABEL</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was it his duty to enter in this book whatever sums he received as he entered them on the cards? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It was, and in early times I believe he always did so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was he in the employ of the society of which Mr. Gregg, Rathbone, and others, were trustees? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; it was his duty to pay over weekly the sums he received during the week.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">This indictment, laying the money in the Royal Liver Friendly Society, the Recorder required proof that the Society was entitled to be so described. Mr. Abel put in the Rules of the Society, certified under 18 and 19 Vic. c. 63, sec. 19, but they only provided that the property should be laid in the Trustees. Mr. Abel then applied that the indictment might be amended in conformity with Lord Campbell's Act. The Recorder entertained considerable doubt whether the Court had the power to amend in this case: Lord Campbell's Act enabled the description of a body corporate to be altered, or the names of any persons to be corrected, but did not provide for the substitution of persons for a body corporate. The Jury were therefore directed to find the prisoner.</hi>

                  </hi>. I am a clergyman of the Church of England—I used to live at 10, Portland-road—the prisoner was in the employment of myself, and other clergymen who resided there, as a sort of confidential servant—it was part of his duty to receive money from me and the other clergymen to pay the trades people—he had a salary of 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. a month, besides perquisites—his wife was employed as housekeeper—the Clergy House dealt with Roberts and Son as grocers—early in February this year the prisoner made a communication to me about the amount due to them, and I gave him 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to pay the trades people, inclusive of Roberts and Son—he afterwards, subse<lb/>quent to 6th February, brought me this receipt—I can't remember whether he put it into my hand or not—it was pinned to another receipt, which I may have found on my table, and put on the file—he was given into custody in August, and his wife also—I then produced this paper to him, and asked if it was his writing—he said it was—I said, "Then it is a forgery," or something equivalent to that—he said nothing, but went out of the room.</p>

               <p>of money with him—after that he said he wanted to speak to me privately, and we went to the Duke of Clarence, at the comer of the London-road, to the private bar—he there said he thought it was a very great pity that a smart young man like me should be hard up—I said it was, but at the present time I could not help it; I had not been so long—he then said that he could make my fortune for me—I expressed my willingness to have my fortune made—he pulled out a large pocket-book from his side pocket, and, took out half a sheet of letter-paper, partly printed and partly written, opened it, and said, "This is what we are doing of now"—he told me they were shares of allotment of the Scinde Railway Company, the fourth issue, twenty shares—I read that one down—(<hi rend="italic">looking at those produced</hi>)—this is the one—I noticed that it was signed "H" or "W. J. Nicholson"—I am quite sure this is the one he showed me—he asked me if I knew any stock<lb/>brokers—I told him I did, I knew two—he said, "So much the better. Now, if you will go and sell these for me to-morrow morning, as there are four of us in it, your share will amount to about 24<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 25<hi rend="italic">l</hi>."—I led him to believe that I would do so, but to make sure what they were, I asked him to show it to me again—he then pulled out another one, just the same thing, only at the bottom it was signed, "Elizabeth Phillips"—I handed it him back again, and made an appointment to meet him next morning—I made a further appointment to meet him on the same evening, which appointment I did not keep—he then went away—he said he had got some<lb/>thing else for 4,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in his pocket, but that must go to St. Petersburgh—I immediately went to Bow-lane police-station and made a communication to the police—I met the prisoner the following morning at the Obelisk in St. George's-circus—he was talking to the crossing-sweeper—he said to me, "You are not dressed smart enough"—I told him if he would wait about an hour I would make myself smarter—he said, "Oh!"—at that time a man, whom I have since ascertained to be Calder, came up, and the prisoner said, "If you won't do it, here comes a man that, will"—he told Calder to walk on towards the Oxford public-house in the Westminster-road—Calder did so—I saw nothing more of him at that time—I have since seen him in New gate—on the Monday morning following, 6th July, the prisoner came to my shop—I asked him how he got on on Friday; whether it came off all right—he said, "Yes, partly so; something ought to have come off on Saturday, but did not."</p>

I live at 1, Bell-place, Battersea-row, Whitechapel—on Friday night, 28th August, I went with Stephens to the "George" public-house to have a pot of beer—we left there about half-past 12—I was outside the door, but I did not leave till Stephens came back to me—he then went a little way in the street, and then Grover knocked him down, he struck him, put his hand over his mouth, and had him by the throat, and then he let him go, and the other prisoner came and struck him. in the eye—I halloed "Police" and "Murder"—I saw Gearing with both his hands in Stephens's pockets—I saw no money—I kept hallooing "Murder"—there were five round him—I was struck down by a crack on the head, and a policeman was struck down twice on top of me by the prisoners—I do not know whether that policeman is here—he was there just after the robbery was done—Stephens got the soldier by the neck, and gave him in charge, but instead of taking him they took me—I was as sober as I am now, and so was Stephens.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house surgeon at St. Bartholomew's Hospital—Graham was brought there on 24th July, and remained till 8th September—the internal lateral ligament of his knee joint was lacerated, and the joint in consequence became inflamed; it was not dislocated—the injuries are not likely to be of a permanent character—I think he will recover from them—such injuries could have been caused by violently throwing a man down; the leg got twisted under—I should think it would be three months before the one leg is as well as the other.</p>

               <p>—<hi rend="smallCaps">BARROW</hi>. I was in Mr. West's counting-house, heard a scuffle, looked up, and saw the heads of the prisoner and Mr. Graham, and then heard a great blow or fall—I rushed into the front of the shop, and found Mr. Graham on one knee, and the prisoner had just recovered himself from a fall, I presume, close to him—I heard nothing said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner. Q.</hi> Did Mr. West order you to go for a policeman? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He gave me no order, but I said to him, "Give the rascal into custody imme<lb/>diately," and to my astonishment he demurred to that—I being an invalid could not go, or I should most certainly have done so—I went to the shop door, but I could not cross to the Police-station; the traffic was so great—I called out for Mr. West's foreman, and I believe Mr. West did too—we raised Mr. Graham between us—you did not say you had come for your instruments.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence.</hi> T he only thing I can say is that Mr. Graham and I were on perfectly good terms. I went to the shop on that day, and offered him some pebbles, and he said Mr. West was not there then; they were good samples, and he would very likely buy them. It is very easy to say a man is drunk when he comes in without his hat. Mr. West came out and said, "Chuck the b—b—out of the shop;" that is his regular language. Mr. Graham laid hold of me, and fell on me; he is much bigger than I am; it is not likely I should take hold of him. Mr. West prevented me being bailed at the station-house, which shows the animus he has against me. <hi rend="italic">The Prisoner called</hi>

                  </hi>. I am an articled clerk, of 7, Furnival's-inn—on 13th August, about half-past 3, I was standing at the gate of Furnival's-inn—my attention was called to two omnibuses coming towards the City; one was a light green omnibus, and the other a dark green—the dark green was coming first; the deceased was conductor of that omnibus;—that was about ten or twelve yards in advance of the other when I first saw it—the omnibuses were very near Brook-street when I first saw them—that is not far from Furnival's-inn, between that and Gray's-inn-lane—I should think they were coming between eight and nine miles an hour; I think that is much faster than omnibuses usually go—the conductor of the dark green omnibus, I be<lb/>lieve, was going towards the pavement on the Furnival's-inn side to get a passenger; he got off the board for that purpose—his omnibus had then stopped—he was going towards the near-side. pavement, when the off-side horse of the light green omnibus knocked him down, and the hind wheel passed over his head, and he was killed instantly—there is no hill there—the light green omnibus went on about thirty yards before it was pulled up, nearly to Leather-lane—the prisoner was the driver of that omnibus—when the deceased jumped off the board, I think the prisoner appeared to go quicker instead of stopping—I did not see him pull up at all, or try to pull up—I was nearly thirty yards behind when he actually stopped—I followed him up—I did not hear anyone call out to him—at the time the wheel went over the deceased's head, the near wheel of the light omnibus was, I should think, two feet from the pavement—I can't say whether there was room for the prisoner to have driven on the other side of the dark omnibus; it was an open space there—I do not know whether there were any other carriages in the road at the time—there is a urinal there, in the centre of the street, about twenty-seven feet from the pavement.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a physician, residing at 1, Montague-place, Kentish-town—on the day in question I got into the dark green omnibus, of which the deceased was conductor, in Southampton-street, Holborn—I had been standing there five or ten minutes; I noticed two omnibuses coming along at a very rapid pace—I had scarcely time to get into the dark green omnibus before it went on; in fact, it did not stop to take me and my friend in, we got in while it was in motion—I noticed an omnibus in the rear, and by the stamping of the conductor on his foot-board, and other movements, I was led to notice that they were racing—when the dark green omnibus came near to Day &amp; Martin's factory, finding, I sup<lb/>pose that the proper side of the road, the near side, was blocked, it went round the south side of the cab-rank that is in the centre of the road there—nothing particular occurred till we came near to Furnival's-inn, except the constant urging of the conductor to his coachman to get forward, as the light omnibus was gaining upon him—when opposite the urinal in Holborn the dark green omnibus drew somewhat across the road, in a slanting position towards Furnival's-inn—the conductor had got down from his omnibus and gone in front of it to the side of the horses—as the window was open I heard him request his coachman to pull across the road, as the light green omnibus was advancing somewhat quickly—he said, "Pull across and stop them"—while he was in that position a very loud scream, as I afterwards learnt, from his wife, drew my attention to where the man was standing—he was then with his back to the upper part of Holborn, as if going to some passenger on the kerb, and I saw the light green omnibus advancing very rapidly; the collar of the off-horse caught the man at the back of his head, whirled him round and threw him on his back, and the hind hoof of the off-horse struck him on the side of the face—there was a slight attempt at movement on the part of the poor fellow—the fore wheel then grazed the side of his ear, taking it off, and the hind wheel caught the back, passing over the face, down the centre of the chest, and over part of his right leg—I immediately jumped out of the omnibus and picked him up—an immense volume of blood escaped from his mouth—he died about half a minute afterwards—his wife was a passenger in the omnibus—the light green omnibus went in on the near<lb/>side, and I should think from the swaying of the omnibus the wheels must have been close in to the kerb—there was certainly not room to have gone on the other side, between the urinal and the dark green omnibus.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then was the consequence of turning the dark green omnibus. horses' heads towards the pavement, to render it impossible for the other to pass it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes—I jumped out immediately I saw the accident, and while holding the deceased I called out to some one to run after the omnibus and stop it—I noticed it about twice the length of this Court before me, about thirty or forty yards, before I noticed that it had stopped—he passed on the left-hand side, between the kerb and the dark green omnibus, and went down Holborn-hill—the obstacle he met with was the deceased, no other.</p>

I am a lighterman in the employ of Charles Price and Co.—on 24th June I had charge of the John lugboat, and received eleven casks of oil and nine casks of turpentine into it between 4 and 6 in the evening—I received these two delivery notes with them—I moved the boat out into the river, and made it fast to a coal barge—it was 7 o'clock before I left her—I gave the two notes later the same evening to Lewis, a lighterman in my employ—I saw Pemberthy that evening on the City Gas Wharf—he spoke to a man named Allen, but I do not know what he said, as we were some distance apart—that was forty or fifty yards from the lighter—Allen and I afterwards walked up the wharf, and had a pint of beer together, and then he went home—he was at work on a barge—I saw Pemberthy last on the City Gas Wharf at 7 o'clock, or a few minutes after—it adjoins Messrs. Price's Wharf.</p>

I live at 77, High-street, Woolwich, and am a tailor—on the night that this <hi rend="italic">row</hi> occurred, I was standing outside No. 77—I saw it begin—I saw the police-constable there, and heard him telling the girls to go inside the door—there were three or four of them; they were not creating any disturbance; they were standing quiet, one of them sitting down; they went in after a while—Mills came out of his house, and there was a conversation between him and the policeman—at that time I saw Flynn come out of a public-house, which is next door, and go and stand at his own door—the policeman said to him, "Get inside your door," in a land and angry tone—Flynn said he was standing at his own door, and he should stand there as long as he liked—he was on his own premises—the constable told him to go in a second time, in a loud and angry tone, and Flynn said he would not go beyond his door; he could stop there as long as he liked—that was all that passed between them at that time—shortly after that I saw the police-constable struck by somebody; it was not Flynn—I swear that—the policeman was knocked down by the blow—I was standing out<lb/>side my own door, on the same side, and had an opportunity of seeing and hearing—Flynn's house is 76—I was outside that house—I lodge in Flynn's house—the policeman did not order me to go in—the policeman got up and drew his staff, and was following the man who struck him, but he was got away by his wife and a man—the policeman then went across the street and struck Flynn, who was standing alongside of a barrow there, a violent blow on the temple; the side of the head, which nearly knocked him down—he did not say anything before he struck him—Flynn was standing quietly by the barrow—the two or three women who had been there were then inside Mill's house—a crowd began to collect, and Flynn got a broom alongside of his own house—I did not see who gave him the broom—he followed the</p>

I live at Eltham—I was formerly servant to Mr. and Mrs. Engleheart—I lived there four months—the family consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Engleheart and two children, Constance and Percival—the girl was the eldest—there was no other servant but me—Mr. Engleheart was in the habit of going to business in the morning and returning in the evening—on Friday, 31st July, he left as usual to go to business—in the afternoon the child Constance dirtied in the dining-room—I had put the tea-things in the dining-room—at that time my mistress was upstairs—the child was on the floor, and the milk-jug upset—I heard Mrs. Engleheart come down stairs from her bed room into the dining-room—she called me up from the kitchen—she said the child had dirtied itself, and told me to get a cold bath and put it in the sink in the back kitchen—she said she had promised her a cold bath, and now she should have it—I got the bath ready, and put it in the sink—Mrs. Engleheart undressed the child upstairs, and brought her down and put her into the cold bath—the child was quite naked—she tied a duster round its mouth, and then put it in the bath, and she dipped its head in two or three times while it was in the bath—the water was in a tin hip-bath—this is it (<hi rend="italic">produced</hi>)—she then took the child out and wiped her, and put her on the edge of the sink to drip—it was a stone sink—she then stood her on the floor and wiped her, and then she gave her some cod-liver oil out of a bottle—she gave it her out of the bottle—she put the bottle in the child's mouth, and poured it in—the child spilt some on her breast and shin, and then she put her in the sink, and pumped on her—she held her with her left hand, and pumped with her right—the child's head was on the sink under the pump—she pumped on her four or five pumps—she took the duster off its mouth when she took her out of the bath, and threw it down at the side—the child did not cry out when she was put into the bath; the duster was in its mouth—when the mother was wiping her she gave her a slap with her hand, and then she cried—she struck her first, and then the child cried—she did not cry when she was being pumped upon; she was quite quiet—when she had pumped upon it four or five times she wiped it, and took it upstairs—the child was kept in the cold bath about ten minutes, I should think—she was not up stairs above two or three minutes, before she came down with the child insensible—during that time I was in the kitchen—I did not leave it at all—I was in the kitchen the whole time—the kitchen-door was open—the stairs are close to the kitchen-door—I did not hear anything during that time; no sound as of anything falling—the kitchen is so near the stairs that if anything of the weight of a child had fallen from the top to the bottom of those stairs, or even half-way, I must have heard it—when my mistress came down with the child insensible she said she had let it bide too long in the cold bath, and ordered me to get a warm bath—I got a warm bath, and she put it into it; it was this same bath—it did not recover at all—she told me to go in to a neighbour's and get some brandy—I went to Mrs. Wood's; Mrs. Morrison was at the gate, and I asked her little</p>

               <p>girl to go for the doctor—Mrs. Morrison came in first—I was there when she came in and asked what was the matter—my mistress told her that she had let the child stay in the cold water too long—I afterwards saw Mrs. Morrison point out a bruise on the child's head, and she asked how it came there—my mistress said she had let it fall down stairs—that was the first, time she said anything about the child having fallen—I was there when it died; about 5 o'clock in the morning—this took place about half. past 5 in the evening—it was about 6 when Mrs. Engleheart told this to Mrs. Wood.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of William Morrison, of Eltham; my house is next to the prisoner's—on Friday afternoon, 31st August, about half-past 5, the prisoner's servant came in to see if we would send for a doctor—in consequence of what she said, I went in—I found the child in a hot bath, and the prisoner was rubbing it—she said she had put the child—into a cold bath for a punishment, and she had put her into a hot bath after<lb/>wards—I took the child out; I said I never did approve of baths—the servant brought a blanket, and I took the child in my arms till the doctor came—I went into the back-kitchen, where there was a fire—I saw a bruise on the side of its face, and I mentioned it, and the prisoner said the child had fallen down stairs—I said, "Oh!"—she said she took the child up, it looked so blue and cold, and was going to put it into her bed, and she brought it down to put it into a hot bath, that the doctor had recommended her to do so, that her sleeve caught in the gate on the stairs, and she lost all power and the child must have fallen out of her arms down the stairs—she after<lb/>wards said the child had fallen down stairs over the banisters, from the head to the foot—I remained with the child until the doctor came, and until 10 at night; it was then put into bed with hot water in bottles—I went in again at a little past 5 in the morning—they knocked at the wall for me—the child was then dead; the servant and I washed it, and laid it out—it had bruises from head to foot—I never spoke to Mrs. Engleheart till that evening, but I had heard the child frequently beaten.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon living at Eltham—on Friday afternoon, 31st July, about a quarter to 7, I was called to Mrs. Engleheart's to see the child—it was in a state of collapse, almost pulseless, pale, and I thought was going to die immediately—I remained with it about an hour—it died about 5 in the morning—I afterwards made a post-mortem examination—I found that the cause death was extravasation of a large quantity of blood on the</p>

               <p>brain—there was an external indication to account for that, a large bruise on the right temple—there was a recent bruise on the top of the left foot, and several minor bruises, old bruises—those were the only two recent bruises that I observed—I look on the bruise on the right temple as un<lb/>doubtedly the cause of the extravasation—the lungs and all the other organs were healthy—no other portion of the body indicated anything serious, or likely to cause death.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">DR. BLAKELEY</hi>. I was examined before the coroner, I had attended the deceased child before—I attended it about a year ago—it was a weakly child, suffering from general debility—I recommended it, amongst other things, cod-liver oil, and an occasional cold bath with salt in it to strengthen the system—I think a child ought not to remain longer than about five minutes in that bath—cod-liver oil will occasionally act upon a child as an aperient—I did not see the child put into the bath.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">The evidence given by the prisoner before the Coroner was put in and read as follows</hi>:—"I am the mother of the deceased child; I gave her two doses of cod-liver oil on the Thursday. I did not give her any on the Friday morning; as stated by my servant Jane. On Friday we dined at 2 o'clock. After dinner the child sat on the stool in the dining-room. Between 5 and 6 o'clock the servant came up to ask if I would have the tea. I said, 'Yes'—I went up stairs to dress; the child remained with her picture-books; she said, 'Here comes Jane with the tea; I shall get good now"—Jane brought the tea-things up before I left the room. When upstairs I heard the rattling of the tea-things. I ran down; the door was open; a cup was on the floor, and the milk upset; the child had dirtied itself, and dirtied across the carpet I called for Jane, who came up directly, and said, "Oh, what a naughty girl! I have not left the room a minute." I told Jane to bring down the bath from upstairs, and I said to Jane, "I've many times promised her a cold bath, and now she shall have one." I took the child down into the back-kitchen, and there undressed her; Jane got the salt, and put into the bath; I tied nothing over the mouth of the child at first; I stood her up in the bath, and washed her. Jane said, "Can I help you?" Jane washed one arm and hand. A duster was then brought, and it was tied round her head over her month; I then dipped her into the bath, head and all; I then stood her on the</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="186309210079"/>
               <p>floor on an apron, and wiped her; I sent for the cod-liver oil bottle, and poured some of it into her mouth; some came over her. I held the child over the sink, and Jane pumped. The child was perfectly quiet. I wiped her again, and carried her up stairs at once; I put her down on the landing, and told her to go into the room, and put her night gown on; she did so, and came back to my room. I saw she looked very cold, shaking very much. I said to her, "You are a stupid little monkey to do those things; you are cold;" she said, "Yes, ma, I won't do it again." I said, "If Jane has got any hot water I'll put your feet in. "I was going to bring her down stairs; my long dress sleeve caught in the bolt of the gate; she fell over the balusters on to the stairs, about half way down, and then rolled further down. I called out, "Jane, Jane, <hi rend="italic">Conny</hi> has fallen over the stairs. "Jane did not come. I went down stairs and met Jane, who came in at the back—door. I told her <hi rend="italic">Conny</hi> had fallen over the stairs. She said she had been in the back garden to empty the bath. I asked for hot water, and told her to bring it. I told her to go to Mrs. Wood, and to send for the doctor. Mrs. Morrison came in directly, and I told her I had let the child fall over the balusters. Three or four minutes afterwards Mrs. Wood came in; the doctor came in afterwards.</p>
               <p>The only statement I made to Mrs. Morrison and to Mrs. Wood was that the child had fallen over the balusters. I said nothing about keeping the child too long in the water. I never struck the child; I corrected her as a mother would. I never ill-used the child. I never struck the child that afternoon. She was always crying. She was very fractious. She was a little weakly child; a slight gust of wind would blow her down. I never struck the child with the stick produced. The child ate the chilies of her own accord, only one. I was up stairs only two or three minutes with the child. I did not knock the child's tooth down her throat on the Thursday.</p>
               <p>I noticed the child had lost a tooth, and I did not know what had become of it until Jane told me she had found it in the motion which passed from the child on the Friday. The bath was emptied, and the carpet was taken into the garden before I came down with the child. I deny the statements made by Jane; they are untrue."</p>

               <p>25th July, I left off work at 7 o'clock in the evening—I was at home from 7 till half-past 10, and then I went to my friend, Benjamin Woodnut's sister-in-law's—there was myself, Woodnut, and his brother and sister—we had some steak and bread, and a glass of beer for supper there—that was very nearly eleven o'clock—I had no rum and water there; I had some at the Bell public house, I think, before we went to Mrs. Woodnut's—I was in the Bell five minutes—we left Mrs. Woodnut's about half-past 12, after we had had our supper, and went towards home—we had got a little better than fifty yards from the house, in Paradise-street, I think, when the two prisoners came behind us; they came in front of us first, and then got behind us; and as we were passing, Smith said, "We have been looking for you two b—s;" I turned round and said, "Who do you call two b—s?" and then Smith throw me down; I got up again shortly, and said to them, "I know you to be police," and I saw Smith's hand go towards his pocket, and he struck me in the eye; my eye bled, and it was closed for five days—the street in which this happened is lighted with gas-lamps, and these was a lamp near the place where this occurred—when I was struck in the eye and knocked down, I called out, "Police!"—no police came, and I went towards my mother's house—the prisoners both ran away immediately I called "Police"—just as we got close against my mother's house, the policeman Lamb came running up behind us—I told him I had been assaulted by two policemen, and he said, "Go on, or I will look you up "—he came from the direction in which the other two had gone—Lamb kept pushing us along and told us to get in doors or he would lock us up—I got home, and was taken out of my house about ten minutes afterwards and locked up all night—Lamb and two more policemen came and took me off to the station, and our neighbour next door bailed me out the next morning—I was taken before the Magistrate on a charge of being drunk, riotous, and disorderly, and assaulting the police—the charge was dismissed—I had known both the prisoners before this for years, as policeman in that part—Smith used to call me of a morning—I next saw them when they came to the Police Court on the Monday—I am sure they are the same two men—they did not give evidence on the Monday; they did on the Friday—the case was remanded, and they both gave evidence against us—I was bound over eventually to prosecute the prisoners by the Magistrate—I saw Woodnut thrown down by Allum—he asked the reason I was knocked down, and Allum caught hold of him, and threw him right off the kerb he fell backwards—when he was about entering my house, ho told me he had received a blow on the back of the head—I did not see the prisoners there then—I did not see him struck again that same morning—he was insensible when he was taken to the station-house, and after he got there—Woodnut was quite sober, and so was I.</p>

               <p>said that, I knew I was not drunk, and began to speak about being ill-used by the police, and I was told to hold my tongne—they would not let me say what I wished to say—a policeman in the morning asked me how I got the mark on my eye, and I said it was two detectives on the road last night who had given it me—that was a policeman I knew very well, Sergeant Jackson—it was not 307 M who asked me about my eye—I know Jackson well, because I gave him some money to get my breakfast in the morning—I swear that 307 M did not ask me how I came by that cut, and that I did not reply, "I got it in a row; I always get into a row when I have a drop to drink;" I said no such thing to anybody there—I saw a man named John Rogan up at the Court against me—I don't know whether he was examined—I did not see him that night close to my mother's house just before I was taken into custody—(<hi rend="italic">Thomas Hamlin</hi>, 309 <hi rend="italic">M, was here called in</hi>)—I know that officer; he came into my mother's shop with Lamb on this night after the rattle was sprung, I saw him put his bull's-eye on—I was kicked in the side by Lamb in the shop, and I was taken by the throat and dragged out by him and the other policeman—I believe I mentioned about Lamb kicking me at Greenwich—I could almost swear that I said so—I know the prisoner Smith very well—several others have called me in the morning by knocking at the door—I have engaged him in the night to call me, so I can swear to the man; and I still swear that he is the man who as<lb/>saulted me on this night—I had a hand put over my mouth several times at the station, and was told to hold my tongue—I cannot say who did that, there were two or three policeman round.</p>

               <p>and the two prisoners went away from them—I followed up to Mrs. Thomas's house—it was all in my line home—when they called "Police!" they had gone from ten to fifteen yards from the place of the assault, and a police-constable, 104, I believe, came up—Thomas told him he had been insulted by some parties, and the constable commenced pushing them on, and said he would lock them up if they did not go home—that was just before they got to Mrs. Thomas's door—he did not say what he would lock them up for—Thomas preceded Woodnut, and knocked at the door—a female in her night dress let Thomas in—Woodnut was just behind him, and I saw a policeman stop Woodnut from going in—I will not say it was the same who pushed them on—I then saw Woodnut fall backwards' on his head, and saw him between a constable's legs in a sitting posture outside—six or seven people then came up—I did not see the prisoners come up—I next saw them on the following Friday at the corner of the Greenwich-road, and recognised them—on the Wednesday following the assault I was passing Thomas's house, and saw him standing at the door with his eye bandaged up—I asked him how his eye was, and he asked me if I saw anything of the affair—I was examined at the police-court—I have been in trouble; I got a sentence of penal servitude for four years—it is three years ago last July since the sen<lb/>tence expired—I have been to sea since then; I came home sixteen days before Christmas from Africa, and have been at home ever since—I was at work two years for Mr. Fuller previous to my going away.</p>

The prisoner Allum has been in the police force eight years, and Smith five years—Allum has conducted himself with propriety, steadiness, and integrity; his conduct has been very good—Smith has also behaved in such a manner as to entitle him to the same character—I was on duty at the police-station at midnight when this matter occurred—I remember the persons, who are now the prose<lb/>cutors, being brought in—the defendants were in the performance of their duty that night—the prosecutors appeared to me to be drunk—Woodnut was the worst of the two by a great deal—I entered the charge, which was substantially that of riot and disturbance, and violence—I read it over to them after it was taken down—they neither of them made any complaint to me of having been ill-used by the policemen—they were able to give me their names and addresses—I asked Thomas how he came by the cut on his face, and he said he got it in a row—they were con<lb/>veyed to a cell, and locked up—I saw them again about 2—they were brought in about half-past 1, and I saw them at 2—from the period of their being brought in, until I saw them at 2 o'clock, they never said one word to me about having been assaulted by police-constables.</p>

Smith, Lambeth," was on them, in red letters, four inches long—I missed the barge, and afterwards found it between Lambeth and Vauxhall bridges, on the Surrey side—my master published a bill, which I posted about—I found the tarpaulins at Northfleet, on 26th August, on board the <hi rend="italic">Owner's Delight</hi>—the prisoner was not there—I found him at Gravesend; his mate went with me—I gave the prisoner in charge—the name was cut out of the tarpaulins; a piece of canvas put in its place, and the two were made into one cloth—the value of them was 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.</p>

I went with Twist to North<lb/>fleet, and found the cloth on the quarter-deck—we then went to Gravesend, and met the prisoner in Bath-street, coming out of his own house—I told him he had two tarpaulins on his barge belonging to Mr. Smith—he said, "Yes, I bought them at Hungerford-bridge, and they came next day and wanted 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more, as I had them too cheap, and my mate rowed them to the barge, from the barge <hi rend="italic">Joseph</hi>,"that is J.
