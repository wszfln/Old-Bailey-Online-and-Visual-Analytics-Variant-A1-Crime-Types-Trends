On the 28th of August I went with the witness, Parker, to a marine-store dealer's in Compton-street, Clerkenwell, and there saw a bag, containing bones, which I knew to belong to my master—I fetched my master, and then the bones were gone away—I have once seen a bag and bones of the same description in the hands of Allen—there was one hundred weight, three quarters, and three pounds, and they were worth 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the sacks they were in did not belong to Mr. Parker.</p>

On the 28th of August, about twenty minutes before nine o'clock, I was at my door, and saw the prisoner Lovey come out of Mr. Brien's gate with a bag of bones—I saw Burridge in the yard with Lovey—Gladwin spoke to me, and I went with him to the marine-store shop in Compton street, and saw the same bag as Lovey had passed me with on his shoulder a quarter of an hour before—I remained at the shop while Gladwin went to fetch his master—while I stood there Lovey came in with another sack, and I stopped him—he said a man had employed him to carry them, and given him three pence—I carried the bag to the station-house, and gave him in charge—neither the policeman nor Lovey would carry the bones—I was obliged to carry them myself.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Enfield, and keep a small cottage there. On Monday, the 4th of August, I left Enfield by the morning coach, about a quarter after nine o'clock—I knew the prisoner by sight at that time, and knew his sister was living at a short distance from my house—I saw her in front of the house, carrying some water, when I left my house that rooming—I gave her some directions in case my bell should be rang—I returned about ten minutes or a quarter after eight o'clock—I went into the house by the front door, which was all safe as I had left it—there is a door at the top of the stairs leading to the kitchen—I had left that shut, and found it wide open—I got a light immediately, and examined the premises—I found a cupboard door, which was closed in the morning, wide open—I missed a pair of trowsers from a clothes horse—I went into the bed-room, and found a screw-driver—I know the prisoner's father—he is a carrier from Enfield, and I frequently employ him—when I saw the screw-driver I knew I had seen it within six or seven weeks before—there was a box and portmanteau in the bedroom—I missed from them two dresses, a silk shawl, an apron, four pairs of gloves, six pairs of stockings, two handkerchiefs, and a waistcoat; also a cloak from the parlour, and a fur tippet—I examined the house, and found the kitchen window had been broken—I compared the screw-rdiver with the putty, and found it had been cut with the screw-driver outside, and nearly a whole square of glass taken out—that window was quite whole when I went out—I compared the screw-driver with the impressions, and they corresponded—that would enable a person to unfasten the window, and get in with the greatest ease—I gave information to Mead the constable directly—on Sunday, the 10th of September, I accompanied him and another officer to Harlow Bush Fair in Essex, and to the booth of Thomas Stevens—in consequence of a conversation between Stevens and Watkins, Stevens produced a bundle containing most of my articles, and gave an account of how he became possessed of them—the property lost is decidedly worth more than 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—about 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. at the least—the cloak is worth 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the silk dress 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., (it is quite new,) and the fur tippet 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—they were the articles I lost—I had seen them the night before.</p>

On the evening of the 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi> of August, I saw him on the third floor of the house—he came out of a room I had been at work in—it was a bed-room—he was a slater's labourer, and had no business there—I saw him tucking something white into his trowsers—I told Hawes the foreman of it, and afterwards told the prisoner he had been taking something out of that room, and wished him to put it back again—he said it was nonsense—Hawes said I had better fetch a policeman, and then he took a white waistcoat out of his trowsers, and went and put it back into the drawer—he came out on the landing-place then—I suspected he bad something more, and told him so—he denied it—I was told to go and tell the footman—he then said, "Oh do not hurt a poor man, "and he would put it back—he then took one waistcoat from his right side, and another from his left, and put them back into the drawer—he was going away, and came out on the landing again—I was not satisfied then that he had given up all he had got, and on looking at him I saw something red in his trowsers pocket, and took out a silk handkerchief—I then gave information to Hawes, who sent me down to the footman, and I told him.</p>

                  </hi> I am a tailor and draper, and live in Smithfield. About half-past six o'clock in the evening of the 19th of August the prisoner came into my shop, begging me to give him some list to tie up his stockings—I had a gentleman there—I said I had no one in, if he would wait a few minutes I should have—I returned to the counting-house, about two yards from where he was, and then he said, "I will look in again"—my foreman and son came in, and had occasion to go out again, after which the prisoner came in again—I said, "You are very unfortunate, my son and foreman have just gone out"—he said, "Yes, I know it"—he walked on two or three paces—I looked at him very hard, and said, "You shall not look in again"—I went behind the counter, and he said, "I will look in again, "and he ran off with the coat—I had had my hand on it not half a minute before—I saw him run away with it.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at Upper Clapton, and am servant to Alexander Bell. About half-past three o'clock on the 11th of August I saw the prisoner at the gate—I thought my fellow-servant would answer her—the prisoner went down into the kitchen—I saw her go out—I had left my bag on the table in the kitchen when I went up stairs, and when I came down I missed it—it contained the articles stated—having missed it I thought 1 must have moved it—I did not think any more of it till the policeman came in the evening to ask me if I bad lost any thing—I have since seen the things—they are mine—they were secure five minutes before she came into the house—there was a handkerchief belonging to my master—this is it—I don't know whether she had a basket—she had a large cloak on. <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

I was walking to London—there was another female walking, and she asked me what time it was—I said I did not know—she then asked me to hold this bag while she tied her boot lace—we walked on till we came to a large gentleman's house—she said, "Will you wait here? I want to go ill; "and I said, "I want a sister of mine, but I don't know where she lives"—I gave her a description of her, and she said she would</p>

About 10 o'clock in the morning of the 16th of September, I was in Fenchurch-street, and saw the prisoners watching several gentlemen's pockets, and feeling them—I felt in my own pocket and missed my handkerchief—they were close behind me at the time—I turned back and went down Mincing-lane—I saw them together and ran after them—I collared them and asked them to deliver up my property, which was a yellow silk hand kerchief—they denied having it—I insisted on it that they had it—I searched them and found my handkerchief in Crow's trowsers, at the flap—they were both together—I gave them in charge directly.</p>

On Thursday night, the 17th of August, about a quarter after ten o'clock I fastened the door and put out two gas lights—I left the third partly burning—I lighted the candle from the third gas light, and then went into the kitchen and placed the candle on the shelf—I tucked up my sleeves to do a little job, and somebody rung the shop-door bell—I went to answer the door, and the prisoner gave a note into my hand for Mr. Beaton—he came inside and closed the door after him—I looked at the note and observed the writing to be written very badly—the prisoner took from under his right arm a bag, as if to take out some articles, but the bag being so deep he did not succeed the first time—he gathered the bag up into his left hand, and then I asked him "What is it? can't you find it?"—he let go of the part he had gathered up, and stooped himself to the ground—he then drew himself up, and struck me two blows on my head—before the second blow was inflicted, I saw the weapon in his hand over his head—I could not tell what it was, whether it was iron or wood—on receiving the blows I closed on him—he thrust me backwards, with the idea I suppose of getting into the inner part of the shop I swung him half round and threw him on his back—he then seized hold of my stock, either with the idea of strangling me or of raising himself from the floor—he did not raise himself from the floor—I knelt over him, and struck him two or three blows with my fist either on the head, face, or shoulder—I got on my feet and stamped upon him, while he was on the ground—I then fled to the door to open it, but he being so close after my heels I had not time to open it—he secured his bludgeon before that—I did not see it, but I saw him pick up something from the</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and keep a beer-shop in Lower Shadwell, in the parish of St. Paul, Shadwell. I have known the prisoner since the beginning of last March—he is master of a collier—he came to my house, I think, on Thursday the 17th of August, and asked me to lend him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., as he had come up in a steam-boat to take charge of a vessel to Sidney, and was going to the brokers—I lent him 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he came again next day, and asked if I would advance him 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. more—I said I had not as much, but would advance him 8<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he came again on Saturday, and asked me to lend him 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—I said I wanted what he had got, and could not—he said he was rather intoxicated, and wished to go and lie down—I permitted him to do so, believing him to be respectable—I put him into the first floor front room—the room was locked when I took him up, and I locked him into it—he continued there about two hours and a half—my son had got the key in his pocket, and while he was gone to get me change, the prisoner knocked at the door to come out—I got the carpenter who was repairing the lock to take the bolt off the door, and he was let out—when he came down, I saw he had two frock coats on, and something crammed into his breast—he sat down in the back parlour, and had a bottle of ginger beer, and then went away—the door was locked again as soon as the bolt was put right, and I took the key myself—next morning at eight o'clock I missed out of the drawers a frock coat, a black waistcoat and trowsers, and a silk stock, which belonged to Henry Thompson, a steward on board the <hi rend="italic">Pilot</hi>, and who was at sea—he had left them in my care—I believe the coat to be worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the waistcoat about 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., the trowsers about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., and the stock about 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—I should know them again—there was a purple stain on the right sleeve of the lining of the frock coat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at the property</hi>)—this is the coat, I have not a doubt—this is the waistcoat, to the best of my belief—I have no private mark on it—I believe the trowsers to be the same.</p>

On the 14th of August last, I had a glazier's diamond on my dressing-room table—the prisoner was employed in the house gilding a large frame for Mr. Walker—I did not lock my dressing room door—I missed the diamond about a week after—the prisoner's job was then over—I afterwards saw the pawnbroker's duplicate in the hands of Mr. Walker, by which I found the diamond at Mr. Townsend's, Little Russell-street, Covent-garden—I sent a boy with the ticket, and he brought me the diamond—I know it (<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>) by its general appearance, and also from the maker's name—I can undertake to say it is the one I lost</p>

I am a warehouse-keeper, in the employ of the West India Dock Company—they have premises in Fenchurch-street—Stokes was in their employ, and had been so a little exceeding two years—it was his duty to take charge of certain stores in the warehouse—30,029 1/2 yards of canvas had been placed under his care—it is an article prepare expressly for the Company's use, of a particular weight and quality—I find on this piece of canvas a numerical number, and the contractor's mark on it, the letter M for Murray, and a number, as received on a particular day—these facts satisfy me that it is the property of the Company—I have no doubt of it—I cannot say what quantity has been lost—about two or three hundred yards must have been taken—a person in Stokes's situation must have missed so great a quantity if it had been taken by anybody else—he never made any representation of having missed any before he was taken from his employment—he would have ample opportunity of stealing that quantity if he chose—he had the care of those things—it was part of his duty to send out samples of indigo from the warehouse—they were sent out in bags—if any thing else went out in the bag, nobody else would look over it—it would go out on his own responsibility—on the 8th of August, I saw Stokes send out some indigo—these tools are the property of the Company—they were in Stokes's care—it was his duty to keep them in a store-room—they were to be locked up—he had no authority to take them off the premises.</p>

The two prisoners came to the shop in company, about three o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th of August—they inquired for calico—I showed them some they purchased three yards—there were three bundles of shawls close to my right hand on the counter before they came, all secure—Murray left the shop after they bought the calico—she assigned no reason why she went away without the other—they had been dealing for the same articles—Riley remained about two minutes—she paid for the calico, and then went away—in about ten minutes I missed one of the bundles containing eleven shawls—no other person came in but the prisoners—three of the shawls have been found—I had seen these women several times at the shop before, and served them.</p>

I watch and labour for him—on the 19th of September, at half-past three, or from that to four o'clock in the morning, about 150 yards from the house, I saw the prisoner going across the meadow with something in his hand—there is a regular roost for the fowls in the yard—I followed the prisoner as quickly as I could, and got within about five yards of the hedge, when he dropped two fowls, and jumped over the hedge and dropped two more—I did not follow him any further, as I knew him—I said, "You need not run, I know you"—I knew him well, he lives near Hounslow—I have known him seven or eight years, and I spoke to him the evening before, about seven o'clock—I went back with the fowls, and called Mr. Dickens up—the prisoner was taken between ten and eleven o'clock the same morning, near his own house—I never knew him do any thing more than in this way—I am quite sure he is the person—two of the fowls were quite warm inside the hedge, and two laid in the ditch with their necks broken.</p>

Knaves and villains all! look at my first letter to the company; and what man amongst you will say I am not a murdered man? You would see my body go to earth, my soul to hell, whilst you stood coldly by, and as coldly drank my blood, ere a man of you would stretch forth a finger to save me from inevitable destruction. You saw I had fallen from a state of ease by rash, but reasonable, (I had my reasons,)</p>

               <p>though bold speculations: my all was placed in your hands. Before I was utterly lost I wrote to you to do me justice; but, instead of which, through that liar, knave, and coward, Rowcroft, the filthy instrument through whom you do your dirty work, I was <hi rend="italic">no</hi> only <hi rend="italic">robed</hi> of my money, but my very means of life were cut off by the treachery of that vile thing. I would have saved myself by honourable industry; but the means which were my own then, had you promptly said you would do nothing for me, were sacrificed by the delay, as well as knavery, of your foul servant. Instead of blood, a green and sulphurous matter fills his veins, which, when he goes to hell, will burn and stink, and make the d—dest hell fouler. My all is gone. I am now in debt. I have not yet received one shilling by my profession; and, as you may naturally suppose, I cannot paint nor dig; to beg I am ashamed. Madness is inevitable. I have too much <hi rend="italic">spirite</hi> to ask assistance from you in the name of charity. Cursed be the lips that say I ask it! but I demand a reparation for the wrongs you have done me. Firm in virtue's ways, true to every principle of integrity and honour, what have I fear in the presence of a just God? In my first letter to the company I wrote for you to buy my shares, or pay me back the last deposit of 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. They had never been done at less in the market than what I asked of you, though Spurling could not find a purchaser at the time; he threw the certificate down with contempt. He knew I had paid 365<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for them, and that you held more than that of mine in your hands, besides 10,000<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. forfeited money, the Committee are receiving my money, my spirits, and my life I am disgusted with the affair throughout. To cut the matter short, I will have the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. you would wrong me of. Rowcroft sold thirty-eight of my shares for 19<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; he entered an action against me for 11<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I paid him 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for costs. I will give the other shares up. I now demand 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., one hundred and thirty-two pounds nine shillings, or I will have blood, for my blood, which you would spill. I will so manage my business, you shall feel my malice before you find me. Rest assured of that. I have nothing now to hope or fear from man. I shall not be tried by him. Should you send the money to a shilling, remember to a shilling, to 17, Cirencester-place, to Miss Gage, and a letter for me, for her to forward to me, before five o'clock next Wednesday, I shall rest satisfied till I receive assurance that no proceedings will be taken against me; otherwise, you, the most official of those <hi rend="italic">Buchers</hi>, may rely on going to Heaven with me the first time we meet. I hope I shall be believed, when I give my oath my purpose is firm, if I fall, I shall not be considered a coward, a rogue, or an assassin. No man in the world can say I have wronged him. My letters will prove I am not destitute of feeling; my actions, that I am true to principles of integrity; the courage I have shown in this business will prove I am not destitute of honour; and the society I keep will prove I am not disrespected. Judge me as you will, so long as I have blood in my veins, I shall be what I am. My pen refuses to mark the infamy of that coward, Rowcroft; he, as you all know, lent me 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. I did nothing to give him a bad opinion of me. He called on me before the note was due, when he saw the shares had gone down to nothing. He knew my circum stances; knew that if I could raise that sum it was all I had in the world. He thought that if he could snatch the money from me before I learnt the price of the shares in the market, he would be safe; he knew he had betrayed me, and thought that if 1 discovered it I should not return his money; he wanted me to get him the money immediately, as a favour. I thought his visit omened no good. I went to see the evening paper that day, and saw</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180079"/>
               <p>the shares quoted "0 to 0. "If he could have snatched my life with impunity, he would have done it, just as soon as have snatched that money from me. He called again the next morning early. The villain will tell you, if there is one particle of truth left in him, that I said, as soon as I saw him, 'I have seen that the shares have gone down to nothing; but I assure you, that if it is the last shilling I have in the world, the moment I get it I will give it to you. 'When the note became due, he refused a letter to Mr. Scott, which was the same as money, and which he himself had asked for, merely because I had called him my friend: that certainly was a libel, but it was a mistake. I never denied the debt. At last, he called again on me. I declare, that though his behaviour was gross and unbecoming, I do not think that Christ, with all his virtues, could have shown more meekness or better disposition than I showed towards him. He called me a swindler, and, as I understood, challenged me to fight, by proposing to refer the case to any two gentlemen in London. He went immediately, and did his worst. I wrote to Mr. Marshall; and the day after the committee meeting I called to pay Rowcroft, who (in the presence of Mr. Hodges, who I consider a good man) refused to take the money of me, and <hi rend="italic">refered</hi> me to his solicitor. He said that the committee had passed a general scowl on my letters. I almost lost myself for a moment. [Ask Mr. Hodges.] I went; desired a friend to call on him, to ask if he considered me a man of the strictest integrity and honour? He said, 'No. 'My friend then reminded him he had proposed to settle the affair in a gentleman-like manner, and called on him to name his friend. This he declined to do, saying he did not feel bound to give me any satisfaction. He said he had proposed to settle the affair between gentlemen, but that he did not mean to fight: he meant to have it settled with talking alone, as a point of law, <hi rend="italic">wether</hi> I was bound to pay the money or not. A poor excuse, when I never denied the debt. I went the next morning, paid the debt and costs, wrote to Rowcroft to save that character he had wronged, by giving me a letter to my friend. He kept me, I think, more than an hour waiting, and then said he would not give me an answer. Never brute showed more cruelty than he has shown to me, and now the vilest thing could not show more cowardice.</p>
               <p>I remain, Gentlemen, true to my oath.</p>

               <p>John Bagshaw, Esq., M. P., Universal Life Office, King William-street." "P. S. June 26, 1837. Lieutenant J. Holland, R. N., is my mother's son; when I became of age I voluntarily gave him 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; I wrote to him for assistance in my present difficulties, but it appears he has turned his back on me. My sister's husband is in town on a visit to me. I have shown him kindness all my life; I have lent him money at times; I lent him 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he held for two years. I asked him yesterday, but never before, to lend me only 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which he refused. After this what can I do? I never looked forward to a moment in my life with more pleasure, than I now look forward to that which will take me from a world of trouble, either a comfortable sleep, or a better state of existence. I pride myself in the cause in which I fight, for I know I shall have the thanks of all those who have been dupes to your knavery, and the regrets and prayers of those few who know me. Should you settle the affair by doing me justice, I give you my honour, which none of you will doubt after what you have seen of me, that I fight only for myself. I shall not let one word be known to the rest of the shareholders, though in justice I must say, I think them <hi rend="italic">robed</hi>. Had I not written a letter to the committee before the shares went to nothing in the market, I should not have had</p>

               <p>the impudence to take this bold step; but now I am determined to be resolute to the last. I have <hi rend="italic">coppies</hi> of these papers, which I shall carry in my pocket; so if I fall, the press will expose the foul acts of the company to the abuse and contempt of the public. Be assured I shall be safe before I desist, I shall have all my papers returned, and a letter assuring me, and signed by all you may have shown these papers too, on your honour that no proceedings will be taken against me, in any shape whatever to injure me. I shall then consider you rogues, but only on a par with the rest of the world. I shall leave word with Miss Gage before I leave home, to receive 132<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for me; she knows nothing more of the affair, neither can she discover where I go—for your own sakes I wish you to be assured that my project will not miscarry; you may rely on it, that if art and patience will carry it into effect, it will be completed. Should a know ledge of my temperate and industrious habits be of any use to you, you may ask what you like of me of Mr. Ralph Price, or the oldest academician, Mr. Smirke. First claim, £150.</p>

I was called in to see the deceased on the 14th of July—I found him in Moneyer-street, lying in a back room, which was a very dirty, close room, and in a very shocking bed—a very improper one—he was very much exhausted, and very dirty—I gave him some brandy and water, and bread soaked in it—he appeared to me to be labouring under the effect of fever—he eat the food very hungrily—indeed very ravenously—I had him removed, but did not continue to see him—I was sent for by the overseer—I was merely called in casually—he appeared to me as if he had had a fever, which was produced, no doubt, by uncleanliness—it was typhus fever, produced by uncleanliness and want of food—I saw the body after death—it was very much emaciated—the appearances were such as might be accounted for by want of food.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the parish surgeon. At the request of the parish officers I proceeded to the prisoner's house in Moneyer-street, and saw the deceased—I found him in a state of very great exhaustion and debility, something like the debility arising from fever—I recommended his removal, and thought the place not fit for a lad in his condition—he was in a very filthy condition, both in his clothing and also his person—he was removed as soon as possible, in an horizontal chair, to the workhouse—I had him placed in a warm bath and thoroughly cleansed, and placed him in a clean bed in our infirmary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> In your judgment as a medical man, independent of any statement he made himself, could you account for this fever—from what it might arise? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It did appear to me to arise from want of proper necessaries—after he was cleansed I had port wine and beef-tea given him, in small quantities, not to injure him—he rallied after a few days, and I allowed him a mutton chop—I was obliged to give him food in very small quantities—he would have taken large quantities if I would have allowed it—he eat very ravenously, I must admit—he rallied for a time, and about the end of three weeks his disease returned, and on the 14th of the following month he died—I saw him every day from the period of his coming into the infirmary—he did not express to me his conviction that he should not recover—I was still in hope he would recover—he told me he was not likely to recover, but I did not encourage him in that idea—he said he thought he was going to die—he said so first, it might be, about a fortnight after he was placed under my care—I did not encourage him in that—I tried to raise his hopes, but he did not reply to me—he continued under the same impression—he repeated the observation to me on several occasions afterwards—he did not at any time appear encouraged by what I said—he said he felt himself sinking—perhaps he did not believe what I said, but he did not say whether he did or not—he made no reply—he repeated the observation three or four times—I continued to encourage him, and gave him as much hope as I could; but I think he continued under the impression that he should die, for I heard him tell his sister as well, after I had encouraged him, that he should not live—he stated to me that he had not had a sufficient quantity of food, nor any necessaries which his situation required—I think that was all he said—he was very much emaciated when I first saw him—his appearance corresponded with that of a person who had been kept without food—I think that would account for the low kind of fever I have described—I examined the boy carefully, on the day following his death—the external parts of the body were very much reduced—I then proceeded to make a <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination—I did not find sufficient internal disorder to account for death—the lungs were adhering to the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> from previous inflammation, but that would not account for his death—no other part of the body presented any appearance of disease whatever—my attention was directed to the <hi rend="italic">mesenteric</hi> glands—they were in a state of disease, which may arise from defective nutriment—the stomach was blanched—it did not seem a healthy stomach, but still not in that state which would kill a man—I should think it would become unhealthy from the want of food—if he had been kept short of food the state of the stomach would be such.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of James Heseltine Bayford, an live at No. 8, King's-parade, St. Luke, Chelsea. On the night of the 20th of August a fire broke out, a little before ten o'clock, in our bedroom—this watch was lying on the dressing-table at the time—I saw the prisoner in the passage some time after, coming down stairs—he had come in with others to extinguish the fire—it might be a quarter of an hour after I had seen the watch—I had not seen him in the room—I missed the watch a few minutes after the fire was discovered—not before I saw the prisoner there—it was a gold watch, with a silver dial—it was a French one—I am not aware of the value of it—it may be worth 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—a policeman was employed to search the persons as they went out—I believe there were several per)Bi in the room—there might be a dozen or more in the house besides our own family—the prisoner came in with the crowd—I did not know him before—he was exceedingly active in extinguishing the fire, and went into the thickest of the flames—the fire was got under in about twenty minutes—no damage was done except to that room—I am quite sure I saw the watch after the fire broke out—it had a gold chain, one seal, and two watch hooks.</p>

He was destitute, and I gave him shelter at my house—he is in very bad circumstances, and has just come from the Queen of Spain's service—on the night of this fire I saw him at my house, about half-past seven o'clock—he went away, and returned about eleven o'clock—I was in bed when he came home—he told me he had been to the fire, and exerted himself very much, and the gentleman had promised to reward him—he said he was very wet, and that he was going to help into the house with the engine, and went away—he returned in about five minutes, and told me he had found a watch—I understood him to mean in the road, but I was nearly asleep—he showed it to me, and next morning he left it at my house—I saw the prisoner at the chimney-piece, and found the watch hanging up inside the chimney—he left it there when he went out, hanging up inside the chimney as far as I could reach up—after he was gone I looked there, as I heard it ticking—I took it to Mrs. Bayford, who claimed it—the prisoner always bore a good character—he has been two years in Spain, and was in great distress—he had nothing to eat for two days.</p>

               <p>and got into the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi>—I told him to drive to Kensington—he drove on a little further, and took in two women—I did not invite them in—they got in—the female prisoner was one of them—I did not expect much good from them, and put one hand in my pocket to mind my money, and the other to take care of my pin—in the meantime I felt my watch gone—I called to the <hi rend="italic">cabman</hi> to stop, but he let the horse go faster—I then called a policeman, who came—I hardly knew what I was doing, but the girl got out of the <hi rend="italic">cab</hi> and the policeman brought her back—give me my watch into my hand again, when the policeman had brought her to the station, as I came out again she put it into my hand—I cannot say which woman it was—it was the one that was brought back—the other woman ran away—it was the prisoner gave me the watch, but the police. man must know better than me, because he brought her back.</p>

                  </hi>. I am warehouseman in the employ of the West India Dock Company. They have a warehouse in Fenchurch-street—I am stationed there—the prisoner Stokes was one of the workmen, and has been so about two years—there was a considerable quantity of canvas in the ware house where he was, which was under his especial care—it was given out by him, and the receipts recorded by him—I have found between two and three hundred yards of that canvas, which is a quantity that could not have been taken without his missing it—he never made any complaint or representation of missing any up to the time of his being taken into custody—I have seen a man of the name of Ridler at the warehouse in Fenchurch street speaking with Stokes—that was after the Company had received, (through a person of the name of Morris,) some intimation of some of their property being stolen by some of their servants—I desired one of our people, named Cooper, to follow Ridler when he went away—it was Stokes's duty to send out from the warehouse bags containing samples of indigo, and to accompany them as far as the outer gate, where the gate-keeper was stationed—that would give him an opportunity, if he were disposed, of putting canvas or any thing else into the bags containing the indigo—the gate-keeper would put his hand on them, but not examine them narrowly—that would not enable him to detect canvas in the bag—on the 18th of August, Stokes sent out some indigo in the way I have mentioned—I should say this is a part of the canvas under Stokes's care—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—it corresponds with cloth we have on the premises made specially for our use—there is no mark on it, but I should say it is the property of the West India Dock Company—I should say it has not been made up thus for the honest purposes of the Company—this bag which was found on Wagstaff is also the Property of the Company—some of their canvas bags which were found on Wagstaff have the appearance of having rubbed against indigo.—(<hi rend="italic">See page</hi> 662.)</p>

PRICE</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Are you acquaint ed with Mr. Morris? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He first introduced himself to me in May—Mr. Tyrrell introduced the name, not the man—Morris stated that he could afford me information of a robbery being carried on at the West India Docks warehouse, by a man of the name of Stokes—Morris did not engage me to employ a person to purchase stolen commodities belonging to the Company, for the purpose of detecting the thief—I never made any offer of a bonus to Morris at any time, for doing any thing towards a discovery of any robbery on the Company, nor did any body in my presence to my re collection—I had an interview with Mr. Tyrrell—he informed me that information had been communicated, that the East India Dock Company had been robbed by one of their servants, which did not apply to them, but as we had a man of that name it must apply to us—I am not able to say whether Morris was employed by some official gentlemen, to use what means he thought proper for detecting robberies on the Company—he had an interview with me, and I took him to Mr. Longlands, the secretary, to afford the information.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you tell Morris, at any time, that any servant in the employ of the Company, who was suspected, should have the opportunity of robbing the Company, for the purpose of detection? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That he should not be interfered with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was that for the purpose of affording Mr. Morris greater facility in using his measures for the detection of robbery? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I know nothing of that—it was Mr. Morris's observation that he might not be interfered with—I did not propose at any time to absent myself for the purpose of affording facilities; on the contrary, I was more about the warehouse and the yard—I had not suspicion of any of the servants at that time—I had no suspicion after the communication made by Morris, and have not at this moment—the Company have been robbed, but the prisoner is no longer their servant—I have had this suspicion since I saw Morris—in con sequence of seeing him I entertained these suspicions slightly; but they were shaken very shortly after having seen Morris—I did not believe it—I believe it now—Mr. Dixon is the inspector of our Company's police—I have seen Morris in his company—he was not called in to a conference between me and Morris—Mr. Dixon is here—I did not give Mr. Dixon instructions to look out after any of the servants of the Company—by virtue of his office he took what measures he thought fit—he had no instructions from me—he directed me that a man would be sent up to watch the premises—I had nothing to do with it—I was desired to allow him to proceed as he thought proper under Mr. Dixon's direction—I afforded him the facility of residence on the premises, for their placing themselves on the premises—I mean Cooper and Mr. Dixon—I know nothing of Morris being employed—he was to be referred to Mr. Dixon—I do not know, of my own knowledge, that any sum of money was offered</p>

               <p>Morris—Mr. Forrester was not employed, to my knowledge—I do not know the man—Morris asked that he should not be interfered with—we were from May till August before we discovered any delinquency in the servants—we abandoned all idea of detecting them after May—we discovered that depredations had been committed on the 11th of August, and our suspicions had been attempted to be excited in May; but they were not confirmed in August—when I was told of it in May I did not believe it—after the detection in August I began to think there was something in it—that proved there was some ground for my suspicions, and that I was mistaken in May.</p>

I received some money, and went to a public house when I came ashore from my ship with some shipmates—the prisoner came into the public house—I was holding a sovereign in my hand to get the change of the waiter, but he did not come in, and the prisoner said, "Hand here, I will go and get change for you"—he took it out of my hand and went out—I never saw him before, and never saw any more of him till about eight days after, when I charged him with it, and told him, if he would give me the sovereign, I would not say any thing about it—he said, a girl stole it from him when he went out—he never went to the bar to get the change, as I thought he was going to do.</p>

I am a prisoner in the Fleet Prison—I have a private room there of my own, and a key of my own—the place where I live is called the "Fair"—I have the sole occupation of the room—last Sunday, about eleven o'clock, I left my room to go to chapel—I locked the door, and put the key into my pocket—I always do so—I came out of the room with another person, and locked it—I returned about a quarter past twelve o'clock, and when I came to my room I found the door about three inches open—it alarmed me very much, and I said, "Who the devil is here?"—no answer was given, but in a minute some <hi rend="italic">chap</hi> came out of the room against me—it was the prisoner Davis—he said, "What business have you in</p>

I went there on Tuesday night, one week before she died—I saw nothing in the least unpleasant between them while I lived there—I went out early in the morning to work, and saw nothing—I was at home the day she died—there was nothing the matter with her health, that I know of, when I went there—she was grumbling about something or other—she was not ill, that I noticed of—she had a black eye when I went there, and there was a little cut on the eye brow—I do not know how that came there—I have known the prisoner about twelve months—they might quarrel sometimes—I was at home on Sunday the day before his wife died—I was in bed when he went to work—I got out of bed about nine o'clock—she then said she was very poorly—she was not in bed then—she was about the house—she died on Tuesday night—(I was before the Coroner)—when I came home on Sunday night they were quiet—I sat on a chair, and sent out for a pot of beer—five of us drank it—Mr. Farrell borrowed 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. of the prisoner, and he told his wife to go out for half a gallon of beer—his wife took the shilling, and walked out with another woman for the beer—Mrs. Hennessey did not come back, and Mrs. Farrell told the prisoner that his wife had taken 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. out of the 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—he said, "Where is she"—she said she went down the hill for some snuff—she came in afterwards, and he asked what she took the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. for—she said she took no 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he said, "Yes, you did, and you shall give it back"—he shut the door, and <hi rend="italic">banged</hi> her in—she up with the pot, and threw it over me and another man—he caught hold of her, and threw her against the bed—he took something like a small handkerchief from her, he up with his fist and struck her three or four strokes with his fist on her head—that was the Sun day night before she died—I told him twenty times to behave himself—he took away the 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>., and went out of the room—when I saw her on Monday morning she complained of being poorly, and said her chest was sore—I walked out directly I spoke to her—when I came in to breakfast I said, "You had better go to the doctor's, and get bled," and it seems she went—the doctor came in the evening, and she was not in-doors—I advised her to have medical assistance, because she was grumbling and growling—the doctor met her as he went out, and returned with her and bled her.</p>

                  </hi>. I am assistant to Addington and Gibson, surgeons. I saw Mrs. Hennessey on the Monday before she died—that was the first time I recollect seeing her—she complained of great pain in the chest and difficulty in breathing—she appeared to be suffering in that way—she pointed to just below the right breast—I examined her—there appeared an extensive inflammation in the chest—I desired her to go home and go to bed,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180121"/>
               <p>and I said would mention it to one of the principals, and either Mr. Gibson or myself would attend to her—I mentioned it to Mr. Gibson, and then went to her, and bled her to about fourteen ounces, and administered the usual remedies to abate the inflammation—she appeared to be very ill—I saw her next morning—she said she was in less pain than the day before—the bleeding would account for that—she appeared still very ill, and died in the evening—I was present at the opening of the body—I saw the chest examined—it bore every appearance of a high state of inflammation—the whole contents of the chest were more or less inflamed, and the right side more particularly—both right and left were inflamed—on removing the integuments there was the mark of an old contusion, and some effused blood in the cellular membrane of the throat, extravasated blood—that might be caused by external blows or injury of some sort—kneeling on the chest would be likely to create inflammation there—that would be highly probable—I do not think that inflammation was connected with pressure on the throat—I think the inflammation of the chest caused her death—there was also a broken rib—it appeared to me to have been broken before, a new structure had grown up, and been again broken before the union was perfect.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Holborn. I at tended Mrs. Hennessey for influenza about three weeks before her death, from which she had perfectly recovered before her death—I saw her on the 15th, and found her suffering from inflammation of the chest and throat—I observed a blackness about the right eye—it had been cut—there was the remains of a wound just above it—it appeared to have been inflicted about a week previous—I gave her advice and some medicine—on the Thursday after her death I examined the body—on examining superficially the parts of the body I found no marks of violence about the head, but on dissecting the scalp from the brain, there was extravasated blood between the scalp and the brain—I should ascribe that to some external violence received, and from the appearance of some spots, they were of different dates—on dissecting the integuments from the chest there was some extravasated blood on the right side of the throat, and likewise some on the chest—on examining the chest I found that the fifth rib was fractured about two inches distant from its union with the cartilage—on opening the chest, the lining of the membrane on the right side was in a state of inflammation—the lungs were likewise inflamed, and of a darker colour than they should be—the air tubes leading from the lungs were in a state of inflammation, which appeared to spread along the whole of the their ramifications till it terminated at the corner of the mouth—those appearances were quite sufficient to account for the death of the woman—there were no marks of violence on the body, except those I have mentioned on the eye and eyebrow—on dissecting the integuments there were marks of violence on the right side,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183709180122"/>
               <p>a little behind the seat of fracture, behind the fractured rib—I think kneeling on the chest would most likely break the rib in the way in which we found it broken, but I think there must be some blow to account for the extravasated blood—I attribute her death to inflammation within the chest and throat—I have heard the witnesses examined—I think the account they have given quite sufficient to account for the mischief I found, but I hardly think the fractured rib sufficient to produce the whole of the inflammation I found in the chest—I think blows might produce the inflammation—I have heard that several blows were given in the side, but that would not sufficiently account for the appearances I saw—it is a thing we do not meet with, to find such extensive inflammation arising from a single fracture of one rib.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Supposing a person thrown down on the ground, struck with a fist in the side, and violence of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> If that had been the case, I should have found marks externally of such violence—I do not think they would wholly disappear after eight or nine days—I ascribe her death to inflammation within the chest and throat—I think the fractured rib caused inflammation on the right side, because the inflammation round the seat of fracture was more intense than in other parts—I attribute the inflammation of the lungs to other causes, such as cold—she had perfectly recovered from influenza—I am not acquainted with any other natural cause to account for the inflammation—she appeared tolerably well in other respects, when I attended her for the influenza—the throwing up of blood would proceed from a ruptured vessel—it is not a common thing to proceed from external violence, and I do not think it is what we should look for—I hardly think that being knocked down and knelt, on or thrown violently down on the floor, would of itself be sufficient to rupture a vessel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined. Q.</hi> Would not the adhesion of the lungs to the pleura convince you that she was a person with great tendency to some disease of that kind? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> It pointed out to me that there was a great disposition to inflammation—the existence of this adhesion, I think proved that she had had inflammation before, and therefore she might have a disposition to it again—I do not know that affections of the pleura have been very common lately—they are not uncommon certainly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> We should be much obliged to you if you could tell us to what cause you ascribe the death of this woman, from natural causes, or inflammation arising from external violence? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> My belief is, that the fractured rib occurred some days before the inflammation in the chest—violence some days after might produce inflammation in the chest, and that inflammation might have been extended by other causes, but it was first occasioned by the fractured rib—I cannot give it as my opinion that external violence alone would produce such inflammation as I found, or that her death is wholly ascribable to external violence—I do not think we have any reason to suppose that inflammation would have occurred within the chest, had we not had the fractured rib in the first instance to cause it, and then, perhaps, by other causes, inflammation was extended, which terminated fatally.</p>

On Thursday, the 7th of September, I was driving my master's wagon—I left it about three o'clock in the afternoon, opposite the Lock and Key, Smithfield—there was a cart-cloth and two ropes in it—I went into the house, and remained there about ten minutes—when I returned my wagon was gone—I found it again about six o'clock the same evening in St. John's-square—nobody was with it—the cart-cloth and rope were missing—about an hour afterwards</p>

I borrowed a halfpenny of the prisoner, and said I would pay him when he sent the invoice of the goods—I took my leather home, and at seven o'clock in the evening I missed my canvas bag, containing 14<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold, two half-crowns, and 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in silver—I cannot recollect taking my purse out when I was in the warehouse, but I know the money was in it at the warehouse—I felt confident I must have left the purse at the warehouse, though I did not recollect having it in my hands—I went back directly, and saw one of the partners, or the warehouseman, Mr. Chapman—I told him what had passed—the prisoner was not there then—I called at nine o'clock the next morning, and saw him—I looked him hard in the face and said, "I left my bag here yesterday, with some gold in it"—he replied," Did you? I have not seen anything of it"—I said, "I must have left it here, for I have been nowhere else where I had occasion to pay money, in the course of the day"—he told me he would go down stairs with me to the lower ware house, and see if we could see anything of it—he turned some skins over, and said he did not think I could have left it there, or he must have seen it—in the course of the afternoon I met the Italian boy, and in consequence of information went to Guildhall—we both went to the house again and saw the prisoner—I said, "That is the young man"—Foster stated to him I was confident I had left my purse there, and we had evidence to prove he had been seen with it immediately after I left—the prisoner said, "The boy is quite wrong, for I only found it a quarter of an hour since, and I was going to bring it to you directly master came home"—he said he found it among a parcel of skins—he put his hand to the bottom of his watch fob and had to work it up before he could get it out—he gave me the purse—I turned the gold out—there was only 13<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. in gold—all the silver was gone and about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in gold.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Praed-street, Paddington—I knew the prisoner and his wife, as neighbours—they lived next door to me—the prisoner is a gardener. On Monday the 11th of September as I was going to bed at half past 12 o'clock, I heard Mrs. Davis groaning next door—I went, and found her lying in the passage, bleeding from a wound in the right arm, very much—it was a deep wound—a surgeon was sent for immediately, and came, I should think rather better than an hour after I was there—it was Mr. Philpot's apprentice—the prisoner had locked him self up stairs in his bed-room when the surgeon came—I had put a towel round Mrs. Davis's arm, and held it tight till further assistance came—I prevailed on the prisoner to open his door, and asked him how he came to do such a dreadful thing—he said Mrs. Davis had been quarrelling with him, and struck him several times—that he took the knife out of his pocket to cut a candle in two, and in an unguarded moment he thrust it into her arm—he said she had struck him first three or four times with a stick—I saw the knife—it was in a case, and is a pruning-knife—it is here—he said he was very sorry for what he had done—I saw Mrs. Davis once or twice every day till she died, which was about half-past one o'clock on the Saturday—they were both sober—I never knew them to be otherwise—she did not tell me in his presence how it happened—it was about half past twelve o'clock when I went in—she told</p>

                  </hi>. I am a surgeon, and live in Upper Southgate street, Paddington. I saw the deceased on Tuesday morning, the 12th, between nine and ten o'clock—I found her in bed, on the floor, and complaining of severe pain in the right arm—I examined it, and found a wound in the inner side of the upper part of the arm—all the superficial veins were divided, but not the artery—she had lost a considerable deal of blood—it was a stab, I should call it—this knife would have done it—it appeared to have gone in about half an inch, and then cut its way out—I attended her until her death—the wound got on very well till the Wednesday afternoon—there was then some inflammation of the veins came on, which subsided by the Thursday afternoon, and when I saw her on Friday morning, erysipelas had taken place—it began from the wound, extended up to the shoulder, and the whole of the side, and terminated in gangrene and mortification—she died on the Saturday—I have not the least difficulty in saying she died from the erysipelas and gangrene produced by the wound—she was not at all apprehensive of dying when I first saw her——she was seventy-two years old—I saw the prisoner on the Saturday morning, the day of his wife's death.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. On the morning of the 17th of Au gust, in consequence of information, I went to the Rainbow, public-house—I observed the back part of the house, and the fan-light—an entrance might have been effected that way—I did not notice the wall then—I saw it after wards, and there was a mark on it—it is the wall at the back of the house, leading into an alley called Gin-alley—it was a mark big enough for a person to put the toe of his shoe in—by getting over that he would get into the skittle-ground, and go to the back-door—the prisoners live in Fox-court, which is at the back of Gin-alley—you must go out of Gin-alley into Narrow street, and then there is Fox-court—it is about fifty yards from the public-house, but twenty yards as the crow flies—I went to the prisoner's house, about half-past seven o'clock in the morning—I tried the latch of the street-door—it was fastened by the top bolt—I could not get in—I knocked, and at last Martyn Flynn opened the window above, and asked what I wanted—I told him I wished to speak to him—(I was in my uniform)—he said, "Very well, I will come down"—he came down, and it appeared as if other persons were stirring in the house, and instead of opening the door, it was fastened by the lock and bottom bolt—I tried the shutters, they were also fastened—I knocked several times before he answered me again, and when he did answer, he said, "Wait, there are females in the room, let them dress themselves"—I waited some time, but he did not open the door—I asked for admittance at the next house on both sides, but was refused—I sent Judge to watch the back of the house, while I endeavoured to get in at the front—while he was gone Thomas Flynn opened the up stairs window, and said, "The man you are looking for is not here"—I told him to come down and open the door—he said he had nothing to do with it, he was only a lodger—the window was then shut down, and I heard somebody in the house say he had thrown something down—by this time Judge returned, and said he could not get in at the back—I sent for a ladder, and placed it against the window—Judge went up and came down again—I went up, and Martyn Flynn had a gimlet with which he had bored through two sashes, and was holding the handle of the gimlet in his hand—Michael had a hammer, and Thomas was in the room with them—the foot of the bed came against the window, and there was a poker and tongs on it—I told him to open the door, I wanted to speak to him about a case of felony, and if he did not open it, I must break in—Martyn said he would not, for a hundred such as me—I came down, and we both tried the street-door, to force it—but it appeared the strength of the whole three was forced against us, for after we got it partly open, so as to get a staff in, it was closed against us—we began to open the shutters, and Martyn then said he would open the door, and did so, and I got in—the three prisoners were in the lower room—a young woman, who, I believe, was the daughter, and an elderly woman was lying in bed, apparently bed ridden—I looked about, and found this gouge lying on the floor in the lower room—I went up stairs, and in a cupboard found this chisel—I came down again, and Thomas Flynn had escaped—we secured the other two and brought them away—the young woman, on my entering, began to cry, before I went up stairs, and Michael said, "What are you crying for? they</p>

               <p>can't hang us for it"—Martyn was present, and Thomas was up stairs then—there are only two rooms in the house, one above and one below and a small yard—there were two great mastiff-dogs in it—Martin rents the house, and the other two live with him—I have always understood so, and seen them about there—after leaving them at the station-house I came back, and found Thomas Flynn in the house—I searched a box, and found a piece of newspaper in it—the box was in the lower room—I found the gouge in the lower room, and the chisel in the upper room—I showed the paper to the prosecutrix—it was open, and had all these folds and creases, as if it had contained halfpence—there are, apparently the marks of penny pieces, copper stains—I have tried the gouge and chisel to this desk—there are marks on the desk, and to the best of my belief they were produced with these instruments—the gouge in particular fits very accurately, both outside the lid and inside—you could hardly get a feather in—and the chisel, also, will fit, with the gouge placed alongside—one appears to have assisted the other in breaking it open.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a policeman. I went with Shepherd on the morning in question, to the prisoner's house—I heard him demand admittance, and knocked at the door—Martyn Flynn rose up the window, and said, "What do you want?"—Shepherd said, "I want to speak to you"—he said, "Very well," and came down, but instead of opening the door, he put on the bottom bolt and the lock—I went round to the back of the house to see if I could get an entrance there—the wall is about eight or ten feet high—I found two mastiff dogs there, but they did not bite, and I got into the yard—I knocked at the back door with my truncheon, but got no answer—I went to the front and got up at the window by a ladder, and there was Martyn Flynn in the centre of the top room, with his daughter on one side, and his son Michael on the other, pressing the window down against me—I got it up about six inches, and Michael said, "Let me have the hammer, I will clench him"—I said, "Will you?"—he said, "I did not mean you, I meant to clench a nail"—they bored the gimlet through the sash to hold it—I got down, and Shepherd went up—I afterwards got hold of the shutters, and when he heard them being broken, he said, "Don't break them open, and I will open the door," and he opened it—when I got in, there was Martin Flynn, Michael, and the daughter, sitting down, crying—Michael said, "What are you crying about, they cannot hang us for it?"—I went up stairs, and Thomas was there—he rose his foot as if he was going to strike me—I got into the room—he refused to come down—I collared him and brought him down stairs—I returned up stairs to look for property, and when I came down he was gone away—when I went up the ladder at first, I saw Thomas in the room—he was standing behind the others, and the poker, tongs, and shovel were by the side of the bed.</p>

               <p>was presented to the sub-committee of accounts every fortnight, and represented as a correct account of what he had received during the subsequent fortnight—there was a separate account book for each rate in the course of collection—this book is the account he produced, and it was checked with the margins of the receipts which he produced at the same time—on the 27th of October, 1834, I find he charges himself with receiving the sum of 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. from Mr. Evans, that is for one quarter's poor rate, 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; a quarter's church rate, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., 7<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; one quarter's improvement rate, 11<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 7 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; and one quarter's rector's rate, 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—it does not state up to what time this was due—on the 27th of October, 1834, there is received of Mr. T. <hi rend="smallCaps">EVANS</hi> the sum total, 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—in the receipt book, on the 4th of November, there 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. is from Brown and Kay—poor rate, one quarter, 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 19<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 2 1/4 d; church rate, one quarter, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 4 1/2 <hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; improvement rate, one quarter, 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 8 1/4 d; rector's rate, one quarter, 4<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—the entry in the book is, Nov. 4, Brown and Kay, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 17<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—on the 8th of November there is a margin in the name of Stannard for 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 12<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—poor rate, one quarter, 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 9<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. church rate one quarter, 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.; improvement rate, one quarter, 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.; rector's rate one quarter, 6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.—the rector's rate is made by the churchwardens for the time being.</p>

On Monday, the 11th of September, the prisoner took lodging at my house, and was to pay sixpence for the night—he came down stairs in the morning, and asked for his hat—he smoked his pipe there and had breakfast—he returned in the evening, and in the morning about half-past nine o'clock came down and asked for his hat and braces—I got up and gave them to him, and not hearing him go out I went up stain, and missed a bolster, sheet, blanket, counterpane, and a variety of articles—my daughter's things are worth about 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., and mine about 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.</p>

                  </hi>, I was captain's cook of the <hi rend="italic">Java</hi> East Indiaman. On the 19th or 20th of July, we dropped anchor at Gravesend, and a person of the name of Phillips came on board—I had not known him before—he was known to the captain's-steward and the ship-steward—it was agreed that I should lodge with Phillips, at No. 8, Coal Harbour, Blackwall—I had a trunk and portmanteau—Phillips said he was going on shore that night; he might as well take my boxes—he employed Wilkinson to take them—I saw them in the boat when they were taken—on the 21st of July I went to Phillips's to lodge—I did not find my boxes, and Phillips was not at home—Phillips afterwards went to get the boxes from Barking, as he said—he did not take me to see the prisoner—I think I saw the prisoner two days after, in his own house, which was pointed out to me by Mr. York, a butcher in Poplar—I went and saw him—he said the boxes were in the hands of some other persons, and I was to meet him on the following day, which would be Monday—he did not mention how we were to get the boxes back at that time—on Monday I met him close by the East India Dock gates—Mr. York was with me then—no one of the name of Crabb was with me—the prisoner demanded the sum of 10<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. from me before the boxes could be given—Phillips was not present—I said I should not pay any such sum, and Mr. York stepped up, and said he would not allow me to be imposed upon—he came down to 7<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. after that—I did not pay it. I said, as I wanted to go to Scotland, my own country, and wished to have no trouble, I would pay 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to have my boxes and every thing safe—he took me to the house of a man of the name of Nunn, in High-street, Poplar—I did not see Nunn—the prisoner went back with me to the East India Dock gates, and I spoke to Crabb, the carman, to get them—I had not heard where they were—the prisoner said the boxes were lying at a place called the Salmon and Ball, Bethnal-green-road—I went there with Crabb and the prisoner—we found Nunn there—some conversation took place between Nunn and Crabb—Nunn said he would have the money before he brought the boxes, or he would not fetch them—I had not been told where the boxes were—Crabb paid him with money that I gave him—the</p>

               <p>prisoner was there—I paid 5<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. to Nunn—the prisoner and Nunn then went away together, and came back with the boxes in the course of half an hour—I observed to Mr. Crabb that my boxes had been broken open, immediately as I said that the parties were out of sight—they went away directly—when I got home I looked at the boxes, and missed six pairs of cantoon trowsers, one pair of black kerseymere trowsers, two waistcoats, two flannel shirts, and several other articles—they were all in the boxes at the time the boxes left the ship—I did not see the prisoner again till I came back from Scotland, which was sixteen days after—I then told him that he had taken the property out of my boxes that was missing, and he offered to pay for it—he asked me to state a sum that I would take—I said I would not state any sum, as I thought it was wrong to take any money of him for them—Mr. York was present at this conversation—when I said it was wrong to take any money, he turned on his heel and went away—I do not recollect that I saw him again till he was taken up.</p>

On the 19th of August I received information that a gown was stolen—I saw the prisoner and her daughter in the wash-house of a house—the place was dark, and I suspected them as there was an alarm—I sent Williamson to look for the prosecutrix, and then saw the prisoner come out of the out-house with a bundle, with her daughter—I said I must search them—she returned into the house—I said I must search it—I took a candle, and searched all round the place—I then told her to step aside, and picked up the gown from where she was standing.</p>
               <p>(<hi rend="italic">The prisoner put in a written defence stating that her daughter had brought a bundle into the house—that the gown was not found under her, and the was ignorant how it came into the house</hi>.)</p>

On Sunday evening, the 27th of August, I believe, the prisoner came to my house with a friend, and wanted tea—they went into a private room and had the tea—he staid there about an hour, and paid 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. for his refreshment—he gave me a £5 note to change for him, and I give him change—I put the note into my desk until tea was over, and then paid it over to Mr. Sherwin, who was drinking tea with me—I gave him three £5 notes and fire sovereigns—I am quite sure one of the notes I gave him was what I had from the prisoner—I should not know it again, as I did not take the number nor date—all I know is, I paid Mr. Sherwin the same note I took from the prisoner—the prisoner did not tell me then how he came by it, but I believe, before be went away, he said he got it by a fight—he had a black-eye at the time.</p>

On Sunday, the 27th of August, I was at the Plasterer's Arms, in Euston-square, and received from Clayton: three £5 notes and five sovereigns—I saw the prisoner in the house at the time, and I saw him tender a £5 note to Clayton—I took notice of the note I—thought somebody had written on the back of it, and the ink had stained all through—I am quite sure Clayton gave me the same note as the prisoner gave him—I examined it when it was in my possession—the writing was on the face—I paid it to Mr. William Alders.</p>

On the 26th of August, in the evening, the prosecutor gave a party, and about ten o'clock he came down, and asked the prisoner to go up and join them—the prisoner went up rather before ten o'clock, and came down directly afterwards, and said it was his turn for sentry at twelve o'clock, and if I would go on sentry for him he would reward me—I said I had no objection, if the corporal gave me leave to take his duty, and he take mine, which he did; and at two o'clock he relieved me—after the prosecutor had returned from going out, the prisoner came into the room to us, and asked us if we would have any thing to drink—and after that, the prisoner went up stairs to Sergeant Hampton's quarters, and asked them to give him something to drink—he came down, and said they would not give him any—"But" said he, "hold your tongue, there is a pie on the table, I will have that"—and he said "They are looking after the key, but I have secured it," meaning the key of Sergeant Hampton's quarters—next morning I asked him what he had done with the pie, and he said he did not know, he could not find it.</p>

On Saturday, the 19th of August, the house was all sale when I went to bed, which was with in few minutes of twelve o'clock—the fastenings of the house were secure as usual—they were quite safe—the windows were not fastened, but the window in question was down, and the Venetian blind over it—that is a window on the first floor landing-place—it was not fastened, but pushed close down and the blind was down over it—my servant, my baby, and myself were is the house on this night—I went to bed, and heard a noise, as I fancied, about two o'clock—I bum a rush-light, but it was gone into by some means, and I was rather surprised at it—I sat up a little time in bed to listen, and after listening some time I heard a second noise over my head, like the fire-irons falling down—I instantly got out of bed, and gave the alarm—I went down stairs, and into the street, as far as the chapel—I went out at the front of the house—I saw one of the railway policemen—I did not see any person go from the house—as soon as I got hold of the policeman's arm, he supported me, and brought me home—I was confused, and could scarcely see, but when 1 returned to the house I observed the window which had been down was open, and the two back doors I found open—those doors had been secured the night before—I discovered that the house had been robbed—I missed some of my own property—my packets were turned inside out, and empty—they were the pockets which I wore—I missed my purse, with six sovereigns in it, and some silver which I had in my pocket, and every thing which had been in it—they had been on a chair the night before, at the foot of my bed, in my own bed room—I have since seen the purse and some of the property. <hi rend="italic">M'Conachy, Q.</hi> Which way did the thieves break into the house? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I cannot say, but the window was open, and I found the two back doors open—I did not observe that the bolts were broken—nor was the win dow that I know of.</p>

On Saturday, the 19th of August, I was sleeping in the house, and about one o'clock I heard a noise—I remained still, and heard it again—I got up—the noise appeared down stairs—I thought at first it was in the parlour—I after wards heard the noise repeated—I then heard it in the kitchen—I got out of bed, listened, and looked over the bannisters on the landing—I saw somebody's hand placed on the bannisters, and a flat candlestick in his and—I could not see who it was—I listened again, as I thought it might I went to bed again, and about a quarter after two o'clock I heard a noise again in the room under me, which is a bed-room, but no body sleep there—about three o'clock, or twenty minutes after, I heard Mrs. Puig—I did not raise any alarm till I heard her—I did not hear her voice—I opened the window and saw her outside—I asked if it was Mrs. puig, and she answered me, and I raised an alarm—my window is at the back of the house—Mrs. Puig went down the garden—I saw a man get up a tree when she was going down the garden—the tree was near the wash</p>

                  </hi> am the wife of the Rev. Joseph Prendergast, and live at Lewisham, in Kent. On Saturday, the 5th of August, I saw the house secured before I went to bed—there is a door from the private dining-room—that room where the boys dine—there is a door into the play-ground from that room, and a window towards the gar den I know that window and door were secure—next morning(Sunday)about six o'clock, when our man King came, he gave an alarm—I got up and come down the first—I went into the school-dining-room, and found the window-sash taken wholly out and removed—it is a small window—I inquired for the flutes and violins, and things on that sort, and the man produced some bundles form the play-ground—one bundle contained four flutes, tied in a yellow silk handkerchief, and there was a violin in a green bag—this property had been in the school-dinning-room the night before—the violin was generally kept on the sideboard—there were some shoes ready to be taken away—some outside the window, some in the play ground; and some on the table—they belong to the young gentlemen, who had left them below on Saturday night—they had been moved from where they were the night before—I saw a hat which Joseph Martyn found, and delivered to me, and I gave it to the policeman—there were four flutes—it was broad daylight when I was alarmed.</p>

I was on duty on the 17th of September, at Deptford, at half-past one o'clock in the morning and saw the prisoner on the road, near Deptford-bridge, about 300 yards from the prosecutor—my suspicions were attracted by seeing something bulky in his pocket—I asked him what he had got in his pocket—he said, "Some things"—I asked what—he said "A shirt and jacket," and he had bought them where he was hopping, below Westerham—I asked him to let me see them—he put the shirt out—I saw it was tumbled and took him to the station-house—I made inquiry, and found the owner as the Monday.</p>

On Tuesday, the 29th of August, the prisoners came after my apartments—I showed them to them—they approved of them very much, and came down stairs, and said they should wish to return to measure the room for a carpet—I am sure they are the person—I showed them the back bedroom up stairs—they came down, and wished to go up again to measure the room—they both went up with me to measure the corner of the room, to see if it would take a large chest—I took hold of one end of the string, and Saunders took hold of the other end—while I was doing so, the tallest prisoner (Thomson) went out of that room into the other room, belonging to Mr. Houston, who lodged with us—they then came down stairs, and wished to see the way about down stairs—I showed them which way the garden went, and then they went out, and said they would come the next day, but they did not—I saw them again at Lambeth –street Office in custody—I saw the watch in the front room while they were talking to me—there was a silver guard-chain to it—Thompson went into the front room—I missed it directly they were gone—the guard-chain was shown to me at the office.</p>

On the 28th of August the two prisoners came about the lodging—I showed them about the house—they went up stairs and when they came down, I took them into the rooms on the ground-floor, and also called my aunt, when they wished to see her—she was on the top of the kitchen stairs when I called her—they saw her in the front-parlour—they did not go into the back-parlour at all—they afterwards left the house, and my aunt went out for a reference—she left about twenty minutes after five o'clock, and the prisoners returned about six o'clock—I cannot say which was the first that spoke to me, but they asked me if my aunt had re turned—I told them she had not—they then asked me if I was sure she was gone to the Strand—I said I was sure she was—Thompson then asked me to lend him a pen and ink to write a note with, as he had seen his brother since he called—I asked them into the front-parlour, and told him the pen and ink was there which he had had in the afternoon to write the address with—they went there, and the pen and ink had been taken away—I asked them to take seats, and went into the kitchen—I left them standing—when I came back with the pen and ink, one was standing on the front-parlour mat, and the other just inside the door—Thompson said he would not write now, he was going as far as Islington, and would return again in half an hour—he asked me if I thought my aunt would ride home, or whether she was sure to come straight home—I said I did not know whether she was sure to come straight home—I said I did not know whether she would ride, but she was sure to come straight home—he them said, if my aunt came back before they returned, and was satisfied with the reference, she might expect their trunks to-morrow morning by ten o'clock—they went away—no one else had been in the house after my aunt went away—I had opened the door to no one but the prisoners—my cousin was at tea with me, but he went out at a few minutes to six o'clock, and I was then alone in the house, and no one else came in.</p>

I was on duty on the 18th of September in Old Kent-road—I saw the prisoner Green driving three horses with a dray—he drove them up to the front of the Prince of Sare Coburg stables—he went to the tap, and had some refreshment with the ostler—he then walked to the dray, and took a quantity of clover-hay to the stable door—I saw Thorn receive it, and take it into the stable—Green then drove the dray on—I followed him till he got opposite the station-house in Black heath-road, and there I took him—I told him it was for stealing a quantity of hay, and at the station-house he said it was only half a truss of hay when he brought it from the farm, and it was usual to leave it for the horses when they returned—I said I believed it was more than half a truss—he still said it was to bait his horses on their re turn, and was set at liberty—I saw the sergeant, and went with him to the Prince of Saxe Co-burg—Thorn was standing outside the door—I called him aside, and said "I have received information that you have some hay left by Barclay and Perkins' man this morning"—he said, "No"—I said, "I have received information that two men have left some here belonging to Barlclay and Perkins"—he said, "No"—I said, "Are you sure of that?"—he said, "Yes"—he went into the stable where a horse was feeding, took from the rack some hay similar to this, and said, "That is all the hay I have got in the stable"—I said, "Is it possible that Barclay and Perkins' men could have left hay here without your knowing it?"—he said, "They could not"—the sergeant went to the next stable, and I followed—he said, "Is this it"—I went to the bottom of the stable, and saw a truss of clover bay apparently the same as I had seen taken in—I brought it out at the stable door, and said, "What is this?"—Thorn said, "It is mine"—I said, "Where did you but it?"—he said, "I bought it"—I said, "Did you pay for it?"—he said, "No"—I said, "Who did you buy it of?"—he said, "A man who has a bit of hay at different times when he called left this hay to pay me for what he had had"—I asked if he knew the man or his employer? he said, "No"—I have brought a sample of the hay here.</p>

                  </hi>. I now reside in Waterloo-road. On the 22nd of August I lived with Mrs. Glenister, at Lambeth—Mrs. Collins fetched me out of Mrs. Glenister's room into hers, which was the next door—I took out my money to send for something to drink, and gave Kirtland half-a-crown to get some gin and beer—I had one sovereign and six half-crowns in my purse then Mrs. Collins once or twice felt my pocket, but she did not take the money out herself I heard Eliza Glenister say she would not have it, but I heard no further—James Collins and Kirtland took me into the adjoining room, where Kirtland's wife laid asleep; and Kirtland held me by the arm, while Mr. Collins put his hand into my pocket, and took out 1<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 15s—Mrs. Collins was not in the room at the time, she was in the other room, holding Mrs. Glenister down there to prevent her coming to help me.</p>

We have lost many staves lately—about two o'clock, on the 14th of September, from information, I went after the prisoner, and overtook him in Redcross-street, and found on him three staves—I told him I had caught him at last—he said, "Will you swear to the staves?"—I told him I would—he said, "Will you swear I have not paid for them?"—I said I would swear he should go to the station-house—the policeman came up at the moment and I gave him into custody—I know the prisoner from his occasionally dealing at the yard for a stave at a time, but not for staves of this description—they are worth 3<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.</p>
