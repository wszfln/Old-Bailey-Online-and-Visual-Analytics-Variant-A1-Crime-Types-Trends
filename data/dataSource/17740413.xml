            . I keep a public house at Epsom; the prisoner came to my house between ten and eleven o'clock at night, about the time horse was stole, and lay there all night; he had a brown bay horse with him; when he got up in the morning he said he was going to shew it to a gentleman that he believed would buy it, and whether he did or did not he should come back and pay his reckoning, but he never did come back or pay his reckoning.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you seen the horse since?</p>
               <p>Bloss. Yes, since it has been restored to the prosecutor; I am sure it is the same I saw the prisoner with.</p>

               <p>I am innocent of the affair; I went to the yard to ask for the Bishop of Chichester's coachman; I came out again; I went down into Hertfordshire; I did not go to Epsom; I never sold any horse to Mr. Chunn; I expected my friends here, but they are not come.</p>

            . I am servant to Mr. Benfield; the two last witnesses brought a basket of china to our house, and asked me to help them down with it; I refused, I did not care to meddle with it, because I thought it was on a bad cause; I thought they were goods that would never be paid for, because there were a great many goods came on the same footing, that were never intended to be paid for; they brought in the china, laid it on an ironing board, and the bill of parcels upon it; Garrett came to me and said it the bill of parcels was taken away the goods would be delivered; then he went down immediately into the kitchen to Mrs. Hall; she came up directly and took away the bill of parcels; Guerin was in the room with the china, and said he would keep possession till his master came; Eddin took away some of the china by the order of Mrs. Hall; he was a servant in the shop, and she took some herself; Guerin said something at that time, but I could not hear what; Guerin took up some china, and was bringing it into the shop; Garrett followed him and said d - n your eyes deliver it to me, and took it out of his hands; Guerin smattered something and turned up his eyes and seemed startled.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was to have the goods in case they were left?</p>
               <p>Turnbull. They were to be among them; Mrs. Hall said, any body that ordered in goods was to have one third and Benfield two thirds; Garrett was a servant in the house before I came; he had no business there after I came; I was but three weeks in the family; they were ordering goods in in this manner every day, from various tradesmen, that they could get them of; after they were taken up, I delivered five parcels to the owners of them, and took receipts for them.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Benfield at home any part of that day to give orders?</p>
               <p>Turnbull. I believe not; he was a bankrupt a day or two afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Garrett take the dishes and a parcel of china from Guerin by force?</p>
               <p>Turnbull. Yes; Mrs. Hall only acted under the direction of Benfield, and had the whole management of the house.</p>
               <p>Q. from Garrett. Did you ever see me concerned in any thing, or did you ever hear me order any thing in?</p>
               <p>Turnbull. I know nothing of his ordering in any goods; he was there among them when the goods were brought in.</p>

On the 22d of February, my men told me there was an order for some goods; I ordered them to go the next morning<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130007"/> with them and not to leave them without the money; they came back to me twice; I went with them and found the china gone; I went down into the kitchen; I saw the woman and two men there; they attempted to shut my servant out of the kitchen; I went to Justice Wright's to get advice, and when I returned home I found Benfield and another person in my house; they offered me a note for the goods; I said I knew nothing of their note; I would not have any thing to do with it; they had got my goods unfairly, and I would take a proper course; but Turnbull had told me they were all to be removed the next night within the rules of the King's Bench, therefore I thought it prudent not to make much noise about it, so I bid him leave the note till morning.</p>
               <p>Turnbull. Hall told me so.</p>
               <p>Morgan. I got a warrant next day, and took all the people we could find in the house, and I found the goods and brought them to Sir

            's; I did not think the note was worth a farthing; it was drawn upon one Luff a publican in Holborn; I sent to enquire after him, and found the house was a very bad house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Benfield indorse the note when he left it?</p>
               <p>Morgan. Yes; I applied to Justice Wright before I ever saw the note.</p>

               <p>I was not in the house; I knew nothing of the china being ordered in; I was just come in from the country; we looked upon Mrs. Hall as our mistress; what she bid us do we did; she ordered us to take the china up stairs, and we did; I am foreman to Mr. Benfield.</p>

               <p>I worked for this gentleman in the burying ground in Russell-court; I was in the burying ground the same day; it was a snowy day, that broke off my work; I worked the day before this Tuesday night he was robbed; at night a little after six, as it is common, I went down to him for some money; he gave me two shillings in halfpence; about six o'clock I went down the end of the court; turning the corner two or three doors from my master's house, I saw Little hanging the lamp, standing upon the steps; he asked me if I would have some beer; two men were with him; one I knew, the other I did not; Relly was one; we all went in together and had three pots of beer; we sat for an hour; then we all came out together to the end of the court; Relly and the other went to the left hand, and we came to the right; I came to Little's door with him; we parted about seven o'clock; he went up stairs and I went home. One of my witnesses will tell you where I was the rest of the night. Relly wrote a penny-post letter to a friend about four miles off; what it was about I cannot inform you.</p>

            . On the 21st of February, as I was returning from Chelsea, I met with two young fellows I was acquainted with; we came to the Red Lion, Piccadilly, where we staid drinking till past twelve o'clock; I was rather disguised in liquor; I went to see one of them home; he would have some liquor; that made me worse; about two o'clock I left him, and coming by Monmouth-street, I met the prisoner; she laid hold of my arm, and insisted on my going with her to a private house, but I would not consent to that; I agreed to go to any alehouse, and we accordingly went to the Two Brewers, as the watchman told me it was; I do not know; there I called for a pint of beer; I fell asleep;

I keep a shop in South Norton-street: about six weeks ago the prisoner came to me, and said she was going to a place in the city; she said she was bare of money, that she had a watch of her husband's in pawn at one Mr. Howell's, and should be glad to sell it for something more than it was pawned for; I went with her, and paid 12 s. for taking it out; I had it valued, and was informed it was worth but 15 s. I gave her the other 3 s. when she was taken; the prosecutor came to me and said it was stole, and I went with him to the Rotation-office.</p>

               <p>I went to drink tea with Mrs. Sidney; I have lived with a young fellow three years, who threatened me if I did not bring him money; I saw the watch hang over the mantle piece; I took it for him, and thought to return it next day.</p>

            . As I was coming through Caple-street, I saw the prisoner come by the prosecutor's door and catch down the handkerchiefs which were hanging at the door, pinned to a gown sleeve; he put them under his arm; I laid hold of him when he had got about five yards from the door; I found the handkerchiefs and two hats under his arm at the same time. (The handkerchiefs produced and deposed to by the prosecutor).</p>

The next day I went to Mr. Baldero's with the draught; they asked me how I came by it; I told them I received it the night before for goods; they asked of whom; I said I did not know the man, he had put his name on the back of it; they said they had no cash in their hands of any such persons; they knew neither the drawer nor indorser of it; Mr. Snaith made a mark on the front, and I marked a C on the back of it that I might know it again. Mr. Snaith gave me notice of the prisoner. (The draught read).</p>

            . I am a sea-faring man. On the 9th of December I dined at Mr. Chapman's; about three o'clock in the afternoon the prisoner came there to look at some sattins; Mr. Chapman<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130023"/> went up into the warehouse with him, and served him with goods to the amount of 55 l. they were packed up, and he offered the draught on Baldero and Co. Mr. Chapman asked if it was good; he said yes, and Mr. Chapman accepted it; the goods were carried to the stand of coaches; the prisoner took them away in a coach.</p>

               <p>Snaith. Yes. The bill was brought and given to my brother, our cashier; my brother shewed it to me; I asked Mr. Chapman how he came by it, and had some suspicion he might be the person guilty of the forgery; but a gentleman coming with him that I knew very well, I took no further notice of it, only made a cross upon it; I know nothing of the party it was drawn by. I told Mr. Chapman there had been three or four others offered for payment that I believed were drawn by the same hand. Knowing the person of the prisoner, I took him in the Borough, and brought him before my Lord Mayor; I sent to Mr. Chapman immediately, who came with the other witness, and swore to his person, first before my Lord Mayor, and afterwards before Sir

               <p>Seaton.

On the 9th of March last the father of the boy came into the shop, and asked to look at some black stockings; the boy was with him: he produced a bill of an advertizing hosier, and wanted to know if they could not be sold as cheap as that; at last he said he could not deal at all, he would talk to his wife and send her about it; just as he was saying this the little boy went out of the shop; I thought it a suspicious circumstance; I followed him to see if he had got any thing; at the next door I overtook him, and found this large bundle of stockings tucked under his coat, and he was going away; I brought him home; he began crying and begged forgiveness; I charged the father as thinking him accessary with the son; I took them before a Justice, and they were carried before an Alderman; they said little in their own excuse there.</p>
               <p>The Father's defence.</p>
               <p>I was going to Newgate-Market; I went up Snow-hill; I live just by; I went into the shop thinking to buy a pair or two of stockings; this gentleman shewed me a pair or two behind the counter; I never moved from the place; the child went in along with me; I asked him the<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130032"/> price; he said four shillings, I said I believed I could buy them cheaper; my eyes were but indifferent; I said I would leave it till the afternoon; I was going to market to buy something for dinner, and would be back in an hour's time; the prosecutor went from behind the counter; there was nobody else in the shop, and left me for about a minute or two; he came back again and brought this poor unfortunate child of mine with a bundle he had under his arm; he was not gone a minute; he came in crying; I said what is the matter? the gentleman said he had got a bundle of stockings; the child is but eleven years old.</p>
               <p>The Boy's defence.</p>
               <p>I took them out of the shop; I did not think they were stockings; I thought they were not worth much; I thought them two or three bits of paper; I was making a lottery, and as I had no money to buy paper I thought to take them home to make up my lottery among my playfellows.</p>

I know the prisoner, he lives at New-street Hill; on Tuesday the 29th of March I called at his house about one o'clock and staid dinner; while we were at dinner a woman came and asked if he had a lodging to let; he said yes; they agreed for five and three-pence a week; she went away and said she should be back in an hour; she came again with her husband and a coachman, and brought a couple of boxes; the coachman brought one box and the husband the other; I think she said at the time her name was Thompson.</p>

            . My Lord, I was in court when this man made an affidavit in the name of Jones to put this trial off; now he appears by the name of Field.</p>
               <p>Q. to Field. What is your name?</p>

               <p>Field. No.</p>

            's for a check of Nicklin and Wells for 81 l. my servant brought me a 50 l. note, a 30 l. note, and one pound in cash; this was on Friday evening about six o'clock; I put them in my bureau in the compting house, and locked the bureau: the notes were my private property. We have a shop facing the street, and a shop backward; the compting house is between them; the bureau was in the compting house. I have learned since, my apprentice who brought the notes wrote on the back of them. I missed the notes on the Tuesday following, which was the 22 d; I had not been at the bureau from Friday; I put my hand on it, and found it open; then I put the key in, and found the lock so damaged the key would not turn; I looked in the drawer where I put the bank notes, and they were gone; I called my other servants, and asked if they knew any thing of the bureau being open. On the evening<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130037"/> before, my apprentice informed me he was afraid the prisoner was going to leave me, for he said he was going to Newcastle; he was then lighting the candles; I went to him and said I heard he was going to Newcastle; he said he had met Dr. Pringle, and he told him he must go immediately to Newcastle, to give evidence on a trial at the assizes; I asked him if he had a subpoena; he said no; I said I could not consent to his going without his producing a subpoena, or my seeing Dr. Pringle; about nine o'clock the same evening I was informed he was set-off. On missing my notes the next day I suspected the prisoner; I went to the George and Blue Boar, in Holborn, and found a person answering the description of the prisoner had taken a place in the stage to Newcastle; that he was very much in liquor, and had taken a woman of the town with him to Highgate or Barnet; I got the number of the notes and took a post chaise, and pursued him; when I got to Grantham I found he had left the coach and taken a post chaise; when I came to Doncaster I found a person of the description of the prisoner was gone in a post chaise, and had changed a 50 l; note with one Mr. Giles; I told Mr. Giles if he had my note it was dated Dec. 12, 1772; he produced a note of that date; then I went forward and found at Borough-bridge that I had overshot the prisoner, and missed him; I pursued him to Newbrivest, where his parents live, and found him at a publick house; I put him in the chaise and brought him back to the Hoop and Lion, a public house at Northallerton; we had no conversation till we came there; only the prisoner said London had been the ruin of him, and confessed the fact at Northallerton; I took him before the Justice; the Justice asked what money he had in his pocket; he took out thirty-three guineas and a half, and said to me, Sir, this is your property, I beg you will take it, and said it is what is left out of a bank note I have changed at Doncaster; he took a watch out of his pocket, and said he had bought it with my money, and desired me to take it; I have it here; he said he had changed the 50 l. note with Mr. Gill of Doncaster; he said he changed the 30 l. note at London, at a publick house in Hosier-lane, Snow-hill; he said the landlord had only 20 l. that he left word for one Soaper to receive the 10 l. for him against he came back. He said that he broke open the bureau on Sunday evening; that he did it by the instigation of some bad women. His confession was taken in writing, before Mr. Peacock, the clergyman, who committed him to York Castle; when I returned to London I found my people had traced out the 30 l. note; it was in the hands of one Dennis in Chiswell-street.</p>

I live in Charlotte-street, Rathbone-place; I saw the prisoner twice before the night he brought the note to my cousin's in Smithfield; I was there on Monday the 21st of March; he came in and said he was going to Newcastle, and wanted a pound of tea to take with him to his mother; when it was weighed he said he had not money to pay her without she could change a 30 l. note; she said she could not change it, and did not know where to get it changed; then my cousin desired me to go to Mr. Ivers to get it changed as he knew me. I went and the prisoner with me; I told Mr. Ivers the gentleman wanted to go out of town that night; Mr. Ivers said he had 20 l. he asked him if it would not be the same if he left the 10 l. as he talked of returning so shortly; he said it would be the same; he gave the note to Mr. Ivers himself.</p>

I passed by the two prisoners in Cornhill; they spoke to me; I did not regard them; then Field came back to me, and catched me round the waste; I struggled and pushed her from me, but I apprehended at that time she took the two pocket books from the pocket in the breast of my coat; they contained two bank notes (describes them) and a bond of 40 l. I did not perceive her take any thing away, nor feel any motion there as if they had been taken away; I shoved her away with my left hand, and she went about her business. When I came to Gracechurch street, I thought my coat felt a little light; I put my hand into my pocket, and missed both my pocket books; I had seen and felt them not above two minutes before I met<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="177404130040"/> the prisoners; I turned back immediately, and run as fast as I could up to Cornhill; there I saw the two prisoners again; I am positive to their persons; I charged the watch with them; they were carried before the constable; I told him I had lost a couple of pocket books; the constable was going to rumage them; upon which I saw

            . I am a constable of Bishopsgate Ward. On the 29th of March I was going round to see if the watch were properly set and minding their business; while I was enquiring into it, Bayes came running up the street; I thought he had been robbed; he said he had; he laid hold of Field, and charged me to take care of her; then he run after Gahagan; he soon brought her back, and then told us he had lost two pocket books, which contained two bank notes; several people then began to croud round them; the watchman and I kept the people off, and kept the women separate by themselves; one of the women (I am not sure which) dropped the red pocket book; it was picked up nearest Field; I did not see her drop it; the prosecutor saying there was another pocket book, which contained the bank notes, I made them stand upright, and set their backs to the houses; then the other pocket book dropped under Field which contained the bank notes.</p>
               <p>Court. As there is no evidence to affect Gahagan I shall not call upon her for her defence.</p>

I went to the house; I bid Phillips take care of Hayward and Turner and then I went down into the kitchen, and there round a press I saw Pickering, Davis, Whitehouse, Bailey and Meetwood; I let Meetwood pass by me up stairs; the others run into the area; I bolted them out; when the three that were got up stairs, that is, Hayward, Turner, and Meetwood were secured; I secured the others; I did not see them do any thing in the kitchen; but there were two lighted candles, and the sticks of the candles were almost covered with halfpence; I would not meddle with any thing, but left it to be done by Clark, who understands these things better than myself.</p>
               <p>Q. from Meetwood. Whether I did not stand in the passage when you came in?</p>
               <p>Bond. No; Taylor brought you up stairs; I did not see Turner till he came up with the other; Pickering was in the kitchen; I could not find them at first; I looked into the cellar, they were not there; then I looked into a little dark place filled with chips, there I found Pickering, with two others; one had got off; Pickering had no coat on; they were all without their coats; Pickering made a strong resistance.</p>
               <p>Pickering. I was not without my coat, ask Phillips if I was.</p>

            . I had received an information that coiners were at work in Fish-street; on the 30th of March I went to this house; Phillips knocked at the door; when I went in I saw Hayward and Turner; Turner was obstinate and would not be tied; Taylor brought up Meetwood; there was a coat in the parlour; we desired Turner to put it on; he said his was in the kitchen; Senhouse went down and fetched his coat, and he put it on; I went into the kitchen; Bond had secured four in the cellar, as he told me; I will not be sure whether Pickering had a coat on, but he sat down in this little back place; I said d - n you come down or I will shoot you; then Pickering said he would come down; he did come down, and we had great difficulty to tie him, as he made a strong resistance; I found in the room a press and two dies for coining halfpence; and there was a great quantity of warm halfpence, and copper ready for scowering, and several other dies; in another cellar I found a cutting out press and several slips of copper for cutting out (produces a gauge ) this is a thing they use to mark the copper so as to cut it according to the size of a halfpenny; that I found in the garrett; in the one pair of stair's room I found some counterfeit halfpence; (producing them) when there are a great quantity to coin it will take at least seven men; the other presses I found are too big to be brought into court; they are at the door; (he produces the copper cut in slips, and also that which was ready for scowering; and also a great quantity of counterfeit halfpence); in one of the dies there is a stroke just under the Britannia's-head; some of the halfpence have the same stroke on the impression, and therefore I am sure they were struck with that die.</p>
