               <p>Q. Why do you suspect the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Bevan. She us'd to come to my house for about a month before, and would usually sit on a bench in my passage, and say she was waiting for somebody: I went out on the 24th of May last, and saw the prisoner sitting there; my servant was then feeding the children with the silver spoons, and when I came home the spoons mentioned were gone.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you meet with your spoons again?</p>
               <p>Bevan. No, I never did, nor saw the prisoner 'till last Friday was a week; I ask'd her if she knew me ? she at first said she did not; but she soon own'd she had taken two silver spoons and gave them to a woman to pawn;<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175902280003"/> and if I would stay 'till next day at 10 or 11, she would go along with me and get them again.</p>

            . I have seen the prisoner several times at my master's, Mr. Bevan's house; I had been feeding the children, and had made use of both the silver spoons in the kitchen; the prisoner sat facing the bar; I washed the spoons, and put them in a drawer in the bar.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner so placed that she could see where you put them?</p>
               <p>Dun. Yes, she could.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you lock the drawer?</p>
               <p>Dun. No, I looked for them in about the value of ten minutes after she was gone, and I missed the spoons.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see the prisoner take them?</p>
               <p>Dun. No.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>I us'd to chair for a midwife that liv'd near the prosecutor's; and when she was gone out she would not trust me in her house; so I us'd to go and stay at his house. I saw the spoons lying on the table and a tankard by them, but I never saw the girl put them into the drawer; I live just by, on Saffron-hill, and never absconded; had I been guilty, I should not have staid there. I was very much in liquor when he took me up, and do not know what I said.</p>
               <p>Q. to C. Dun. Was any body in your house at the time the spoons were taken?</p>
               <p>Dun. There were no body else but the people that belong to our house.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Was she in liquor when you took her up?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I believe she might be a little in liquor, but not very much.</p>

               <p>Q. How much money had you about you?</p>
               <p>Lateward. I had 28 l. 10 s. they seeing this, one kept talking to me, while the other took it.</p>
               <p>Q. Which pocket had you it in?</p>
               <p>Lateward. In my coat pocket.</p>
               <p>Q. Which took it?</p>
               <p>Lateward. I was in liquor and can't tell; that will come out by the next witness. Lovet was gone out, I ask'd Cox after it; presently she wheedled me out to some house to see for Lovet; when I came there, I miss'd my bag with the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is the house you went with her to?</p>
               <p>Lateward. It is in Tennis-court, No. 2. I ask'd Cox for my money, she said she knew nothing of it, and said the other woman Lovet had got it.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you undress yourself?</p>
               <p>Lateward. No, I did not; I do not know that I sat down in the house. She got from me and went away; on the Wednesday evening, being the day following, I went in at the Magpye and Horse-shoe in Middle-row, and call'd for a pint of beer, and was complaining of my loss; the maid-servant of the house told me she could inform me about it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is her name?</p>

There she acknowledged she had five guineas of my money; she was searched, and five guineas, one shilling, and two-pence, found upon her; which is now in the hands of the constable. In the afternoon I found Lovet, and took her before Justice Welch, and she was committed.</p>
               <p>Q. What did Cox say before Justice Fielding?</p>
               <p>Lateward. She said I throw'd my bag on the floor, and said to her, she might pay herself, and she took out fifteen guineas for a k - g bout; but I had no criminal conversation with her. She had equipped her self out very fine with my money, as I suppose; silver buckles, cardinal, gold necklace, shifts, and other things.</p>

I was at the Cock and Hoop drinking a pint of beer with a friend, at the time that the prosecutor was drinking there; the two prisoners were sitting at a table when he came in; he was in liquor; this was last Tuesday was seven-night, at night; he had got the hiccups, the two prisoners made game of him; he call'd them bitches, and curs'd them; at last they had some rum and water. I heard Lovet say to the other, By G - d I have got a sigh out of him.

               <p>Q. What is that?</p>
               <p>Smith. It is a thing that does up with ribbons, I keep a lodging room: the prisoner came to my room, and took my polonese up and look'd on it; she had a red cardinal on; she pulled it off, and put mine on; then she wanted me to show her the yard backwards; I went and showed her; but she would not go there: there were men there.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she pull the cardinal off again ?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes: he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did she put it on a second time?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, she did not: she laid it down<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175902280007"/> on the bed; she went away and turned short off, and did not come up into the room again, and we looked for it after she was gone, and could not find it.</p>

               <p>Smith. I went up in five minutes after.</p>

            . I happened to be drinking at Mr West's in Newgate-market, on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning; there came in the prosecutor with his face all over black, he sat down and called for a pint of purl, or beer.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he sober?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He was a little in liquor.</p>
               <p>Q. Did his face appear dirty or done with blows?</p>
               <p>Jackson. It seemed to be the smut of a chimney.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body with him ?</p>
               <p>Jackson. No: after he sat and dozed about half an hour, Mr West came and shook him, and said, Sir, you must not sleep here, you had better go to bed; he fell to dozing again, and in about five minutes after, I saw the prisoner's hand in his pocket; he awaked and took hold of the prisoner's arm, and said, your hand was in my pocket; then I got up and said, I saw his hand in Mr Swain's pocket; then Mr Swain said he had lost four or five guineas, he did not know which; then the prisoner pulled off his coat and waistcoat, and pulled out of his breeches pocket four guineas and a half and a sixpence. I saw when the prisoner's hand came out of the prosecutor's pocket it was clinched.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he asked how he came by the four guineas and a half?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He was: but would give no account at that time: but before the Alderman he said he had it from the proprietors of the St George or Royal George privateer; that he had got a hundred pounds to receive there besides that: he had another hearing before the Alderman, then he brought a woman to prove she lent it him; she would have swore she lent him five guineas the Saturday before, and that he lived in her lodgings; the Alderman telling her the heinousness of her crime if she should forswear herself, then she would not swear it, and said she did not lend it him.</p>

            . This was at my house in Newgate-market, about two o'clock on the Wednesday morning; Mr Swain came in with his face all smutted; he sat down in a box near the prisoner at the bar, who was drinking punch with another man. I saw Mr. Swain dozing, I went and awaked him, and desired him to go home; after which, I went into the bar, and in about five minutes time the prosecutor arose up and said, the prisoner had his hand in his pocket. I came and took hold of the prisoner, and said, Let me see what money you have: he took out four guineas and a half, and put them into my hand; I kept my hand close and ask'd Mr Swain what money he had lost? he said he had lost five guineas; I said, can you remember any particular pieces? he said he could remember he had a bran new half-guinea of the date of 58; I opened my hand to Mr Swain, and said, here is the money which he put in my hand, which was four guineas and a half, the half-guinea was an old batter'd one. I desired him to look at it, he did, and said he believed he could remember two of the guineas, but was not positive; I returned the money to the prisoner as he said it was his own, and call'd in the watchman that was just without my door, and the prisoner was sent to the watch-house, and Mr Swain went with him, and what happen'd after I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know Mr Swain before ?</p>
               <p>West. I have seen him several times, he comes into my kitchen often.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you before the Alderman.</p>
               <p>West. I was; there Mr Swain said he remembered the last house he had been at, a person had blacked his face, and that he had four guineas and two half-guineas in his pocket, and that he had given one half-guinea to a woman.</p>
               <p>Q. Was this on the first or second examination of the prisoner ?</p>
               <p>West. It was on the first examination before Sir Crisp Gascoyne.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's Defence.</p>
               <p>When Mr Swain was before the Alderman, he asked him how much money he had in his pocket, and whether he was sure he had the money when he went into Mr West's house? he answered he was not sure; the Alderman ask'd him, what house he went into? he said he had been in a tavern or bagnio in Covent-Garden; the Alderman ask'd him if he had a girl in his company there? he said he had: the Alderman ask'd him if he had been concern'd with the girl? he hardly denied it; he said, after he came from thence, he went in at the Wheat sheaf behind St Clement's church; he came in at Mr West's with his face all black. and very much in liquor, and sat down in the box by me; I was with a gentleman that is a manager of a ship, I wanted a birth to go abroad. The prosecutor started up, and said, you have had your hand in my pocket; you have my money in your hand; and said I should be searched; I put my hand in my pocket and took out what money I had, and put it into Mr West's hand.</p>
               <p>Q. to Jackson. Did you hear the prosecutor say he had been in a house in Covent-Garden with a woman, and had given her half a guinea?</p>
               <p>Jackson. He said he had met with a young woman, an acquaintance of his, and they went into a tavern; he said she was not a woman of the town; he said he lent her half a guinea.</p>
               <p>Q. to prosecutor. You have given no account of this half-guinea?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I had two half-guineas in my pocket, the one a new one of 58, on the Tuesday morning.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you take any notice of the other?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, I did not; it might be an old or a new one, for what I know; and on that day (I mean Tuesday) I received 2 l. 7 s. for a piece of shalloon, and 3 l. 2 s. of Mr Brown in Grace-church street; out of this money I gave

               <p>Q. When did you divide it?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. When I was in the room with the woman, after I had given her the half-guinea; then I put the gold in one pocket and silver in another, and then went to the Wheatsheaf behind St. Clement's church, and there spent the evening, and staid 'till about one o'clock; there I was sleepy, and a gentleman there put some black spots on my face.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any thing pass between the woman and you after you had put your money into your pocket?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. No, nothing at all, only bidding her a good-night, and then came away.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure you did not lose your money at the Wheat-sheaf?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I was with none there but gentlemen of credit.</p>

               <p>Mr. Dodkill. I am concerned for my Lady Torrington. I was inform'd her house had been robb'd at <placeName id="t17590228-9-crimeloc54">Hendon</placeName>

There were two silver spoons missing, which is all relating to my Lady; the servants lost other things which they will speak to.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the spoons ever found again?</p>
               <p>Dodkill. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell where they were taken from?</p>
               <p>Dodkill. The other witness can speak best to that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the prisoner live near my Lady's house?</p>
               <p>Dodkill. She knew the house very well; her sister had been house-maid to my Lady, but she is married away.</p>

            . I live servant in Lady Torrington's house; I lost a red cardinal, and a mahogany tea-chest, and a tea-spoon and cannisters belonging to it in it.</p>
               <p>Q. When did you miss them?</p>
               <p>Brett. On the 30th of January.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they taken from?</p>
               <p>Brett. From out of the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Q. Which way do you imagine they got into the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Brett. I believe they got in at a window.</p>

               <p>Brett. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Brett. We suspected her, because her hat was found next morning on the lead that was just by the window at which she got in.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the window in such a situation that she could get up to it?</p>
               <p>Brett. Yes, there is carv'd work on which she could set her feet and so get up to it; and she knew the house very well and bears a very bad character.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did she live at the time ?</p>

            . I was at work at Mr Dobins's house at the time, in Red-lion street; the prisoner had been at work there a week before with me: I was at the constable's house after he was taken up, and heard him own that he had stole the coat, and sold it in Rag-Fair for five shilling. The prosecutor mentioned two pocket-books being in the coat-pocket; the prisoner said he had hid them in Whitechapel, we went to the place he mentioned, but could not find them.</p>

               <p>Q. to prosecutor. Were they two pocketbooks which were in your coat-pocket?</p>

            . I work for the prosecutor: Chatlin came into our Glass-house, and lay there a night or two, and took a chain away with him, and came on the Sunday night following, and I challenged him with taking it; he owned he had taken it, and carried it to the house of Cavenhaugh where he lodged; I went to Cavenhaugh's and asked him about it; he told me he had carried it to one Hawkins a Smith to make him a poker of it; he owned he had let him have something for victuals and drink; he said he was in bed when it was brought to his house, and that his wife had let him have three pence on it: I went to Hawkins's and found part of the chain. Produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the value of it if sold for old iron?</p>
               <p>Bowler. About two shilling or half a crown.</p>
               <p>Q. How much was there of it?</p>
               <p>Bowler. There might be about ten pounds of it.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the price per pound for old iron?</p>
               <p>Bowler. The common price is a penny a pound, but this cost my master above half a guinea.</p>
               <p>For Cavenhaugh.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hawkins. The prisoner Cavenhaugh gave me this chain to make a poker of: he has always bore the character of an honest man.</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. Cavenhaugh bears the character of an honest man, I understand since he was taken up; I would not have prosecuted him, had I not been bound over.</p>

               <p>Q. Why do you charge the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Yates. She came into my shop when I came home to dinner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you know her before?</p>
               <p>Yates. I never see her before to my knowledge: she asked for a yard of quality binding, of a penny a yard, my wife served her.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was you then?</p>
               <p>Yates. I was in a little parlour near the shop: she bought a yard of binding; my wife turned her back and said she was robbed, after the prisoner was gone; I pursued the prisoner.</p>
               <p>Q. Had she been gone out long?</p>
               <p>Yates. She was just gone out of the shop: I ran down the alley, and just as I got through the alley I saw her, and cried out stop thief; she fell to running; she threw one bundle away; I still pursued her; a little time after she dropped another bundle; I did not take up the bundles, but overtook her about the middle of Bury-street; I brought her back to my house, and the bundles were brought back by another person.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you open the bundles afterwards?</p>
               <p>Yates. I did before my Lord-Mayor.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say there?</p>
               <p>Yates. She said she never saw the bundles.</p>
               <p>Q. How many pair of stockings were there?</p>
               <p>Yates. There were seven pair of mens thread, and twelve pair of childrens stockings.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you swear to the stockings ?</p>
               <p>Yates. No: but I can to the mark upon the paper, that they were in. I can very safely say they were my goods and taken out of my shop. The stockings produced in court the paper in which they were in was dirty. Here is the dirt upon the paper, that was occasioned by their being dropped in the street.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose custody have they been since?</p>
               <p>Yates. My Lord-Mayor delivered them to me to produce here on the trial.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you sure the prisoner is the woman that came into your shop at that time ?</p>
               <p>Yates. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see her drop the stockings?</p>
               <p>Yates. I did, both parcels: the first she dropped before she came to the corner, and the other a few yards distance.</p>

               <p>Q. How long have you known the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Sus. Yates. I have known her I believe about three months: she came into my shop on the 13th of this instant February; I did not see her take the stockings, but I am sure they were in the hole where they usually lie, when she came into the shop, and they were gone when she was gone; she came in for a pennyworth of quality binding; she has come before and her errand was generally for a half-pennyworth of tape, or a yard of quality binding.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any other customers in your shop at that time?</p>
               <p>Sus. Yates. No, I had not: our shop has a counter on one side, and the stockings lie on that side that the counter is not on; when I missed the stockings, I called out I was robbed; my husband ran out and she and the two bundles were soon brought in; I know the stockings to be my property; the stockings were brought in by a child about eleven years old, so not capable of swearing.</p>

I insisted on the girl's shewing me the woman's lodgings; we went to her lodgings, but she was out; I went again in the evening, and we broke the door open, in order to find some tools that were given an account of before the Justice; as we had just done, the woman came home, and we secured her.</p>

               <p>Q. Did you or your wife let her the lodgings?</p>
               <p>Drew. My wife did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was you by at the time?</p>
               <p>Drew. No, I was not.</p>

               <p>Drew. I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175902280016"/>Q. Did any body come along with her?</p>
               <p>Drew. No, she came by herself; I had not then seen the man that was tried with her just now; she brought some things with her and proposed to come at six, but she came at five o'clock; so that I had not time to go to enquire about her character.</p>
               <p>Q. Did Wilson come to lodge with her, for the indictment mentions his having taken the lodging.</p>
               <p>Drew. He came that same night, and lodg'd with her 'till they were taken up.</p>
               <p>Q. How long had they lodg'd there?</p>
               <p>Drew. About two months.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they pass for man and wife?</p>
               <p>Drew. They did; the other prosecutors came to search the lodging-room, the prisoner and Wilson not being at home, the door was lock'd; I gave them liberty to break open the door; the prisoner came home, they took her, they ask'd her where Wilson was; she at last said he was in the Gatehouse Westminster; then I look'd about and miss'd the things mentioned in the indictment out of the room.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they part of the furniture of that room?</p>
               <p>Drew. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find them again?</p>
               <p>Drew. She told me they were at Mr. Fell's a pawnbroker, where I went and found them, and carried them to Mr Fielding's; Mr Fell being there, he took them back again, in order to produce here.</p>
               <p>Q. How did the woman behave?</p>
               <p>Drew. She always behaved herself well, but I belive she has been us'd very ill by the fellow that is just gone from the bar. She once had pawn'd the tea-kettle before, and brought it back again, and I believe, if she had not been taken up when she was, she would have brought the things all again.</p>

            . I have been acquainted with Mr Nash the Tallow-chandler in Fetter-lane, about a year and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see him write his name?</p>
               <p>Needham. I have.</p>
               <p>Q. When?</p>
               <p>Needham. A little before Christmas.</p>
               <p>Q. What was it about?</p>
               <p>Needham. I am a Publican: we have a club at our house which he does belong to; it was a beer club, and he was for altering it, and he wrote this, [producing a paper writing,] here is his name at the bottom: I have seen him write divers receipts in my house.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see him write before September last?</p>

            . I can't say I have.</p>
               <p>Q. to Hooper. When did you offer it in payment?</p>
               <p>Hooper. I offered it the day it was due, with three days of grace, that was December 21.</p>
               <p>Q. When did he write this paper you produce?</p>
               <p>Needham. I saw him write it about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he write it in the same character as he us'd to write receipts?</p>
               <p>Needham. He did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you seen him write before that?</p>
               <p>Needham. I have, divers times before.</p>
               <p>Q. Look at this note (in question) he takes it in his hand.</p>
               <p>Needham. I believe it is no more his handwriting than it is mine.</p>
               <p>Q. Is it your writing?</p>
               <p>Needham. No, it is not.</p>
               <p>Q. How does he write his name, Benjamin, Ba, or Be?</p>
               <p>Needham. He writes it Be.</p>
               <p>Q. How many s's in Nash ?</p>
               <p>Needham. Only one.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. How often do you think at most, you have seen Mr Nash write before Christmas last?</p>
               <p>Williams. I believe I have seen him write five times.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you ever seen him write his name Benjamin at length?</p>
               <p>Williams. I don't know that ever I did.</p>
               <p>Q. to Needham. Did you ever?</p>
               <p>Needham. I never did, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Is the letter N in Nash as he usually writes ?</p>
               <p>Needham. No; this is a large small n, he always us'd to make a large capital N.</p>
               <p>Prisoner's defence.</p>
               <p>I knowing myself innocent, never kept out of the way; the prosecutor wrote that note in my room, because he was bound in a bond of twenty pounds, and this he wrote to make the deficiency up to me; I gave him two guineas out of the money, and the remainder I put to<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175902280023"/> the use that I wanted it for. I have often had money of him and he of me.</p>
               <p>Q. to Needham. Is Nash looked upon to be a man of good circumstances?</p>
               <p>Needham. He is, and has been, so long as I have known him.</p>
               <p>Q. Has not he lately married his mistress?</p>
               <p>Needham. He has.</p>
               <p>Q. What were his circumstances before?</p>
               <p>Needham. That I don't know; he was apprentice when I came there, he always paid me very honestly.</p>
               <p>Q. Was he a poor fellow?</p>
               <p>Needham. I never heard any body reckon him so.</p>
               <p>Q. to Williams. When did he marry his mistress ?</p>
               <p>Williams. About four months ago, or better.</p>

            . I live in Horsley-down, Southwark.</p>
               <p>Q. What are you?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. I am a lighter-man, and dealer in coals.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you carry on a large trade ?</p>

               <p>Cockerham. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you keep a wharf?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. No, I do not; I keep lighters and barges.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation has past between the prosecutor and you relating to this affair?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. Mr Nash has told me several times, that whenever the note became due he would take it up; he said he had got a warrant against the prisoner, and shew'd it to me, but he said he would not hurt a hair of his head.</p>
               <p>Q. What relation is the prisoner to you ?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He is my brother?</p>
               <p>Q. What was the occasion of your brother shifting his lodgings?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. It was because the person where he lodg'd was in trouble, and is now in the Poultry Compter.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever see the note?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. I did the day it became due.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see Mr Nash about that time ?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about it ?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. No, not as I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he say any thing to you about it's being his hand or not his hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. No; but he always told me whenever the note became due he would pay the money.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you read the warrant that Mr Nash had?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was done with it?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He afterwards delivered it to Mr Braddock; he said he never would execute it, or look after him; and his attorney said so too, a great many times.</p>
               <p>Q. In whose hearing has Mr-Nash said this?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. In Mr Foster's, and Mr Franklin's, a master cooper in Thames-street.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the prisoner lodge?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He lodg'd with his mother, and she was arrested.</p>
               <p>Q. Has he been in the neighbourhood since that warrant was against him?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. That he has, several times, to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know that the prosecutor ever saw him?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. I don't know that.</p>
               <p>Cross Examination.</p>
               <p>Q. When your brother went away, where did he go to live?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He went to Rosomon's-row, hard by London Spaw.</p>
               <p>Q. What name did he go by?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He went by the name of James Cockerham.</p>

               <p>Cockerham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you no discourse with Mr Nash about the note?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they show you the note?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. Yes, and the warrant too?</p>
               <p>Q. What was the warrant for?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. It was on suspicion of forgery.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you understand what it was for forging?</p>

               <p>Q. How came you not to ask Mr Nash what he meant by going before a Justice of peace, and getting a warrant for your brother, when he own'd it to be his own hand-writing, by saying he would never hurt him?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. What reason had I to ask him that?</p>
               <p>Q. What was the purport of meeting Mr. Nash?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He sent me a letter in regard to the note.</p>
               <p>Q. What about the note?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He said he had got a note come to his hand.</p>
               <p>Q. What note?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. The note which my brother, he said, had forged upon him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever own or deny to you, that it was his own hand-writing?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He never own'd or deny'd it.</p>
               <p>Q. Then you did not treat it as a forged note.</p>
               <p>Cockerham. I don't know that it can be prov'd to be his hand-writing.</p>
               <p>Q. When he had said he would take up the note and pay it when due, what did you conclude then?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. I concluded it had been a joint thing between them both.</p>
               <p>Q. How a joint thing ?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. I imagined it must be his own note.</p>
               <p>Q. Was Mr Braddock by?</p>
               <p>Cockerham. He was when the prosecutor declared he would never execute the warrant.</p>

            . Mr Nash has told me in several companies, he would own the note, and take it up, and pay it whenever it became due.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was in hearing of this?</p>
               <p>Foster. There were the prisoner's brother Mr Cockerham, and a cooper in Thames-street, and Mr Braddock; he said he would not look after him; he said, while they were in friendship he would own it. I heard the prisoner say Mr Nash was bound in a bond for him for 20 l.</p>

               <p>Q. What was the reason of the prisoner's leaving his lodging?</p>
               <p>Foster. He lodg'd with his mother, and she was in trouble?</p>
               <p>Q. What did Mr Nash mean by owning of it, did he say it was his note?</p>
               <p>Frster. He never said to me that it was, or was not.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppose you was to give a note, should you talk of owning your own note, or owning a note that another man made in your name?</p>
               <p>Foster. If I made a note not intending to pay it, I might say I would own it, by way of screening my friend.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you had any conversation with the prisoner at the bar about it?</p>
               <p>Foster. I don't know that I am bound to answer your questions.</p>
               <p>Q. Have you heard him confess this or not?</p>
               <p>Foster. I never heard him really confess it; I once heard him say in a slight manner, Mr Nash and he knew very well how it came.</p>
               <p>Q. Have not you heard the prisoner say something about the garret?</p>
               <p>Foster. I heard him say he was in the garret when the note was made.</p>

               <p>Foster. I said to Needham, the prisoner confess'd to me, that Mr. Nash and he made it together?</p>
               <p>Q. to Needham. Do you know Mr. Foster?</p>
               <p>Needham. I do.</p>
               <p>Q. What conversation had he and you together?</p>
               <p>Needham. He told me a day or two before the note became due, that he had been along with Cockerham the prisoner, and he found how it was, and that Cockerham had drawn it in his mother's garret, and Mr. Howard did not like it, and he scratched the date out.</p>
               <p>Q. Give an account of the very words that pass'd as near as possible?</p>
               <p>Needham. Two or three days before the note came to hand, Foster came into my tap-room; he said he had been and found out Mr Cockerham and he told him.</p>
               <p>Q. What Cockerham do you mean?</p>

            . I was going on board my ship last Friday in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>Q. Where does she lie?</p>
               <p>Bacon. She lies <placeName id="t17590228-16-crimeloc128">off Bell wharf, St Paul's Shadwell</placeName>
                  <interp inst="t17590228-16-crimeloc128" type="placeName"

               <p>Q. How much would the bag hold?</p>
               <p>Bacon. It would hold about half a hundred weight; he said, he did not know what it was, but upon hearing somebody call sculler, he rowed there and took it in; when on board he showed me the other man, named Goodwin, I took and brought him on shore, but before we got to the justice's he got away.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Bacon. He is, what we call a lumper: that is, one of the men that we hire to clear the ship of the goods.</p>
               <p>Q. What have you to say to the other prisoner Weatheral?</p>
               <p>Bacon. I saw him go out of the stern-port of the ship to assist Neive in taking the bag out of the water into the boat, and before I came to him he went out of the boat in at the stern-port again.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>

               <p>Bacon. I imagine Goodwin had hired them to come off with the tobacco.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any other circumstances than what you have mention'd?</p>
               <p>Bacon. No.</p>

               <p>Q. Whereabouts was the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He was near the coffee-house door.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any body between you and the prisoner?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No: I saw him take a handkerchief out of the gentleman's pocket; upon that I held out my arm to take hold of him; he seeing that, endeavoured to escape me, and got down the Fleet-market, and at the same time flung down the handkerchief towards the foot way; I laid hold of him and held him fast.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you observe at that time what sort of a handkerchief it was.</p>
               <p>Johnson. That was impossible for me to do.</p>
               <p>Q. What did it appear like?</p>
               <p>Johnson. It appeared as a thing like a handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you see it in his hand?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I did, and saw him fling it out of his hand; I called to the gentleman who was just by, and said, Sir, you have had your pocket picked; he instantly turned about, immediately a woman stooped down and took up the handkerchief; the gentleman with an oath, said, it is my handkerchief.</p>
               <p>Q. What was he?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He is a recruiting officer belonging to the army. A handkerchief produced in court.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this the same handkerchief?</p>
               <p>Johnson. It appears to be the same as far as I can say: it was produced before the constable.</p>
               <p>Q. What did the prisoner say for himself?</p>
               <p>Johnson. He asked me what I meant, when I laid hold on him; and when we came into the Watch-house, there he denied the taking of it, and was very saucy with his tongue.</p>
               <p>Q. Did he ever own it?</p>
               <p>Johnson. No: he continually denied it while I was with him.</p>

            . Mr. Johnson, that has given his evidence, came with one Captain Daniel to the Watch-house with the prisoner; there Mr. Johnson charged him with taking a handkerchief out of Captain Daniel's pocket; Captain Daniel came before my Lord-Mayor the next day, and swore to this handkerchief, that is here produced, to be his property.</p>
               <p>Q. Where is Captain Daniel?</p>
               <p>Cusbee. He is gone to the West of England, a recruiting.</p>
               <p>Q. to Johnson. Are you sure you saw the prisoner's hand in the Captain's pocket?</p>
               <p>Johnson. I am certain of it, as I am that I now see your Lordship; and saw him take something out and fling it on the ground; which I have all the reason in the world to believe to be the handkerchief, which the Captain swore to before my Lord-Mayor.</p>

               <p>I had made half a holiday, and had been over the water to drink along with a friend; I was at the top of Ludgate-hill, coming down towards the New-market; there came a parcel of people and said, I had picked a gentleman's pocket of a handkerchief and threw it down: I never touched the gentleman.</p>

               <p>I receiv'd a handkerchief with a few things in it of the girl's (meaning her fellow prisoner) when she came away; I thought they were her own wearing apparel; when they came and took her, I put that handkerchief about my neck.</p>
               <p>Tame's Defence.</p>
               <p>The first time I became acquainted with this woman (meaning the prisoner Kendall) was, I was travelling into Gloucestershire, and came to a place call'd Cheltenham; there I met with this woman, I told her I could knit; she took me to her house to knit for her, her husband was a bricklayer by trade: while I was knitting for her, she bid me tell her husband that I was her brother's child, which I did; she kept a puppet-show, and I travelled with her with the show to a great many places; she can't say that I ever wrong'd her of a farthing, there she is, if she can, let her speak it. We came up to London, and I went to the prosecutor's house, and was hired to be his servant, and was there three weeks this last time, I was with him before; while I was there, he bought me two shifts and was kind to me; this woman came and persuaded me to come away; she came persuading me for three Sundays together; at last, I said I would come away; I ask'd her what she would have me to do? saying, my master has bought me two shifts, and they were very kind to me; she said take all you can, for you know you must never see their faces more, nor your own country neither; I said, what must I take? and said there was some money in the kitchen; she said, take all you can, but be sure take nothing that is mark'd.</p>

               <p>Sturdy. He is a breeches-maker, and lives at Uxbridge; and I knowing the horse, and that he was stole, went to acquaint my lord of him, that I had seen him; my lord not being in the way, I acquainted the steward with the cause of my coming; after that the steward told my lord and he sent for me, and I told his lordship, he sent me to Uxbridge to Mr James's for him; when I came there Mr James was gone out on him; I put up at the three tuns there; I was told the breeches-maker bought him of a blacksmith, named Aldwin.</p>
               <p>Q. to Aldwin. Are you a blacksmith?</p>
               <p>Aldwin. I am.</p>
               <p>Sturdy. I sent for Mr Aldwin, he came, he ask'd me the marks of the horse, he said he had bought such a one of the prisoner, and that he had sold him to the breeches-maker; I said I believed it was the same horse that was stolen from my lord, and that I had seen him at such a place; so he proposed to bring him to my lord, the next day, if he came home, which he did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you a warrant with you?</p>

               <p>Q. How long had she lived with you?</p>
               <p>Smith. About three quarters of a year; on the eighteenth of February I miss'd ten guineas and two eighteen shilling pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. From where did you miss it?</p>
               <p>Smith. From out of a corner-cupboa rd in the bar?</p>
               <p>Q. Are you a married man?</p>
               <p>Smith. I am.</p>
               <p>Q. Whose business was it to keep the bar?</p>
               <p>Smith. My wife kept it sometimes and sometimes I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the prisoner ever use to go into the bar?</p>
               <p>Smith. Yes, sometimes.</p>
               <p>Q. Has she ever received money there?</p>
               <p>Smith. Sometimes she has.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the cupboard door lock'd?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was.</p>
               <p>Q. When it was lock'd, who kept the key?</p>
               <p>Smith. Either my wife or I, sometimes I left it in the lock.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you use to trust the prisoner with the key?</p>
               <p>Smith. Sometimes I have gave her the key to fetch things out for my wife; we had two keys, and one of them was lost about two months ago.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever find it again?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, never: at the time of losing it I did not suspect the prisoner to have got it; but I have lost a great many times brandy and shrub from a closet going up stairs, and from the bar, that I have reason to think she had got the key, since, she has confessed she took the liquor away in bottles to a neighbour's house.</p>
               <p>Q. Can you tell what quantity of liquor you lost?</p>
               <p>Smith. I lost about two gallons of shrub; brandy I cannot tell what I lost of that.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever get any of it again?</p>
               <p>Smith. No, never.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the prisoner in your service when you miss'd the money?</p>
               <p>Smith. She was: I took her before justice Welch, there she confess'd she took the money.</p>
               <p>Q. How long was this after you miss'd it?</p>
               <p>Smith. It was on the Tuesday after.</p>
               <p>Q. What day of the week was it that you miss'd it?</p>
               <p>Smith. I miss'd it one the Sunday.</p>
               <p>Q. What where her words in confessing it?</p>
               <p>Smith. She said she took twelve guineas; she did not know that two of them where 18 s. pieces, but took them to be guineas.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the people names where she said she carried the liquor?</p>

            , as the girl at the bar had told Mr Welch that she perswaded her to take the money from her master, and that she and another woman a companion of her's perswaded her to take liquor; the next day the girl was examined again there; then she own'd she took twelve guineas of her master's money, which he had mentioned to have lost; she said, she took it on the Sunday morning; she own'd to the taking four of them at first and at last own'd to the whole.</p>

               <p>Q. How much should you have had then in all?</p>
               <p>Prosecutor. I should have had eleven guineas, a 27 s. piece, and two 18 s. pieces.</p>

               <p>Hamp. I am porter to Mr Bradshaw; upon finding the door only single lock'd (which we always double lock'd) we suspected some body was got in, so we searched the house.</p>
               <p>Q. Who had the key of the door?</p>
               <p>Hamp. We had; we got a candle and went in, and in the two pair of stairs room, we found the prisoner at the bar</p>

I observed them in close conference together; and upon hearing the prosecutor had lost some lead, I made this discovery, upon which they were taken up. (The lead produced in court) When Bell was taken up, he was asked if he had any body to give him a character, or be bound for his appearance; he sent for Fish, who said he would be bail for him, that he should make his appearance the next day; and by Fish's behaviour we suspected he was concerned in it some way or other; and upon talking to Bell a good deal, he owned he took this very lead off of Mr Gardner's house, and told us where he had carried it, that it was at Fish's house.</p>

            . I keep the sign of the Black Raven in Chick-lane; Bell came into my house at the time Mr Jones speaks of, and I looked narrowly at him; he answered the description that was given of a man that had been seen on houses which were stripped of lead; and by his<xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="175902280037"/> appearance and manner of behaviour by looking into the windows of the house before he went in; he saw Fish and came in, and Fish and he were together a good deal. I fetch'd Mr Jones, and told him I suspected Bell was the man that had stole the lead; and after Fish was gone, I went to stop Bell, he said he'd give me a punch in the face if I would not let him go immediately; but we secured him; then we went to Fish's shop to search for lead.</p>
               <p>Q. What shop does Fish keep?</p>
               <p>Thomas. He keeps an old iron shop; but it did not appear that he sold lead in it; we found this lead in the shop, but was under a difficulty in measuring of it. Then we went and measured the place that it was taken from, and found the gutter exactly corresponded with the place it was taken from; and it appeared to have been taken but a very little time before; the lead was carried into Fish's bed-chamber, for the more ease in spreading it to measure it.</p>

               <p>I was going home; I met with Fish; he asked me to drink with him; we had three full pots of beer; he desired me to lend him a hand; I thought it might be to strike upon his anvil, as he appeared like a Smith; he had me in at an empty house, and he pulled out some lead; it was milled; we carried it home to his house, and he gave me eight shillings; and he desired me to bring any thing to him by night, and said, he would buy it the next day; I thought when I came to consider of it, that there were something bad in it, because he gave me so much money.</p>

               <p>This man (meaning his fellow-prisoner) has gone by the name of Hopson; a woman was in my house when he came with the lead; I was not at home; when I came home they told me a man had brought some lead; I said, after I saw it, you should not have bought it; she said, she had neither bought it nor bargained for it; I said, I would go to Mr Thomas's house, and when the man came there to send him to me; he came; they sent him; I asked him what he wanted; he said, he had brought some lead, and wanted some money; I said, I had seen the lead, and did not like it, and did not care to meddle with it; he said, I need not be afraid of buying it, for it was honestly come by; I said, he should not go out of the house; Mr Thomas sent his wife for Mr Jones; Mr Jones came; they sent for a Constable, and there was a dispute who should charge him; they said, it was my place to charge him, which I did; then we sent him to the Counter. In the mean time I asked him several times, if my wife had either bought or bargained for it: he answered me no, not only once, but several times.</p>

Nevertheless, in regard to the Author, and for encouraging the Spread of so useful and pleasant an Art, if any Purchaser should find the least difficulty in his progress therein, we are ready to forward such a one, on application to either of us, &amp;c.</p>
