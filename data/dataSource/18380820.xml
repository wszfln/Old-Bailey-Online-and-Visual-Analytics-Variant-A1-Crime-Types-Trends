                  </hi>. I am a chair and sofa maker, and live in Clipstone-street, Marylebone. In March, 1837, I purchased a mahogany outside flitch of Mr. Roberts, of John-street, for making the back legs of chairs—it was what is called plum-pudding mahogany—it has a speck like plum<lb/>pudding—I employed a person named Warner to saw the wood for back<lb/>legs of chairs—it would be necessary to saw away some circular pieces-in April I bought the other flitch off the same log—that was all that Mr. Roberts had—that was cut into thirty-six back-legs—after these seventy-two pieces were cut up, they were put out on the front of the shop for seasoning—I had used some of them, but I never sold any—they are not turned—I only sell chairs entire—I thought about Christmas there did not seem so many as there should be out of door—on the 30th of May, Stadley's brother came to me-in consequence of what he stated I applied to Mr. Rawlinson, the Magistrate, and went to the prisoner Stud<lb/>ley's shop, in Castle-court, Castle-street, which is about a quarter of a mile from me-when I got there I saw the two prisoners, Studley and Bird, at work—it was a chair-maker's shop—I inquired for Studley and Bird, and they were pointed out to me—I asked if they had got such things as back-legs of, chairs cut out of five inch, or five and a half inch flitches of wood—they said they had got nothing of the kind—I cannot say which an<lb/>swered—I think it was Bird—I asked if they ever purchased such things—they said they did not, they always bought the plank and cut them out themselves—I saw about half a dozen legs standing behind one of their benches—I took up one of them, and said, "This is my wood." I then called up the officer, who was down stairs, left him in the shop, went to the office, obtained a search warrant, and returned immediately—I gave it to the officer—he searched the shop, and I pointed out all my wood to him that I could see—I found fourteen or fifteen back-chair legs, I should think to the shop, and sixteen that were cut into thinner legs—I have a</p>

                  </hi>. I am a constable. On the 30th of May I accompanied Mr. Kerr to the prisoners' shop, in Castle-court—I waited in the shop while he went for a search warrant—I then showed it to the prisoners, and told them that I was searching for back legs of chairs—I found five pieces behind the bench of Bird—some of them were cut down, and some were entire—I found about nine under the bench, some covered the with other timber, and others exposed—there were some beams over the benches to support the premises, and I found about sixteen or seventeen there—I called both the men together, and said these pieces Mr. Kerr had iden<lb/>tified as his; how could they account for it; but they need not say any thing unless they chose, as they would have to go before the Magistrate-Studley said, "I bought the wood of Mr. Roberts"—I asked him how long since—he said about six or seven months-Bird said about five months, or thereabouts—Mr. Kerr went with me and the two prisoners out of the shop-as we went along I asked who cut these back legs out, and Bird said, "A man of the name of Warner"-Studley said "Warner" also—I asked how long they had been cut—they said, "About three or four months"—I asked where Warner lived—they said they did not know; they could not find him-Bird, upon a question put to him before the Justice, said he had a bill at home of this timber that he bought of Mr. Roberts—the Magistrate allowed him to go and fetch it—this is the bill he afterwards produced—(<hi rend="italic">producing it</hi>)-Warner was apprehended as the thief, but Studley's brother was not forthcoming, and he was discharged.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the same house with the prisoner, in New Castle-street. I recollect the Sunday before he was taken up—he came home at eleven o'clock on Saturday night, and wished me good night—the room where he sleeps is the one pair, right opposite to me—the window is, I suppose, about six feet from the street—I got up on Sunday at half-past four o'clock to do my work—I saw the prisoner about half-past eight, or from that to nine o'clock, come out of his room—I was washing in my passage at five o'clock in the morning-if he had gone out between the time I got up and half-past eight o'clock, I should certainly have seen him.</p>

On the Sunday morning before the prisoner was taken up, I was in Castle-street about fire o'clock, or it may be rather before—I saw a cart there—I saw the person that brought it down—it was a man in a blue smock frock, and he placed it by the third or second door in the street, left it, and went away-before the cart came away, Nash came out of his door, and went round the back street to call Reed-while the cart was left, the boys came into the street, went to the off side of the cart, lifted up a board, and took out a chisel-directly two men came into the street—one was in a blue smock frock—I cannot say whether it was the man that brought the cart there—the other was in a fustian coatee, with bright buttons—he is called by the name of <hi rend="italic">Big Bill</hi>, and it much such a man as the prisoner, only darker—I have seen the prisoner before, but never spoke to him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am an attorney and solicitor—I carry on business under the firm of Blacklock, Bunce, Vincent, and Sherwood—I am the only person interested in a pecuniary point of view in that from—the prisoner entered my service on the 1st of January, 1835—the first year I paid him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; the second year I increased it 30<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., making it 180<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—on the 1st or 2nd of November, 1836, I increased it nominally to 200<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.; but he was only to receive the 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., the other 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. was to be appropriate in another way—he attended to the Chancery department only—I intrusted him also with the receipt and payment of money generally in the office—he kept a cash book to enter the payments—I gave him cheques from time to time to make disbursements—I never gave him less than a cheque for 20<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. at a time—he never entered in that account any sums but those I advanced him for that purpose-in June, 1837, I looked at the state of that account, and in consequence of that investigation, I took that book account from him, and discontinued that employment—on that occasion I forbade him to receive money, or to interfere with money in any way—he was not to meddle or interfere in any way with the money belonging to the office—I bought an iron box, and gave directions in the office, that if any money was received in my absence it was to go into that iron box, and not be carried in the clerks' pockets, but if I returned before night-time,</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200021"/>
               <p>the money was to be immediately handed to me—I usually left the office after post time, about a quarter to seven o'clock—I did not return after that, unless there was a consultation, or any thing of that nature—the money received while I was in the office was to be paid to me directly, and if received after I left for the evening, it was to be placed in the iron box—the box was not locked—the key was left in the office-Heath had the care of the key, and Heath had the account intrusted to him which I for<lb/>merly intrusted the prisoner to keep—the arrangement extended to all the clerks in the Chancery office, and the same arrangement existed in the Common Law office as well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you recollect whether the prisoner has acted on that by receiv<lb/>ing money and handing it over to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In one instance, in December last, be handed me one guinea received from Mr. Westmacott—he brought it to me in the office—I do not know Mrs. Brewin at all-a Mrs. Cowper<lb/>for waite was an old client of the office—the prisoner never accounted to me for two guineas received from Mrs. Brewin, in October last.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Cross-examined by</hi> 
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Before we go into any other matter, Mr. Vincent, let me ask you if it is true, that in June, 1837, you expressly forbade the prisoner meddling with cash on any pretence whatever? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes I did, when I took the book away from him on the 10th of June, 1837—my firm ostensibly consists of four persons—Mr. Blacklock, who is dead, Mr. Bunce, who has resigned his share of the business to me and retired, and the stipulation was that I should keep up the name of the old firm—that was not in writing—Mr. Bunce is here now—he is one of the Masters of the Court of Queen's Bench—the fourth name in the firm is Mr. Sherwood, he holds a public situation in the Common Pleas—he is not a partner of mine, nor in profits of the office at all-his name was merely added to it by way of bringing his son in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So that if I came to your office with a suit, depending to look to the responsibility of four persons, I must look to yourself, and yourself only? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is all—I should suppose our names are in the Law List—I have not looked at it, but I have no doubt they are—I believe Mr. Sherwood is Chief Officer under Fines and Recoveries, under the new Act for taking acknowledgments from married women—I believe he is Chief Clerk of the Court—I do not know what title they give it—there are or six offices now amalgamated into one under the new Act, and I believe he holds them all—there are many offices he held—he was Clerk of the Judgments, and Clerk of the Dockets—I believe he it now called Chief Clerk of the Court—he is an attorney—he is on the roll and takes out his certificate—he never interfered in my business except to take the money while I was out-to look after the money while I was at the assizes—he is named in the firm, but I will not admit he is a partner-his son is about twenty-one years of age—he is articled to me—I do not practise in the Court of Common Pleas at all—I am obliged to keep business in one Court as well within I can-our connexions are all northern agents—I do not recollect a case within five years that I have had to go into the Common Pleas with, but if a client was sued there, I should certainly have to go there—I keep his son strictly at work—he is always in the Chancery department—I intend that to be his department—that is the department where the prisoner was also em<lb/>ployed—I have sometimes two hundred suits in that department in the course of a year, agency and proper—I think when we were burnt at the fire in the Temple, I had to make a list, and could not make out quite two</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200022"/>
               <p>hundred—the fire was on the 6th of March—I lost every thing-great deal of money must be disbursed in the course of those causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> But that you forbade the prisoner to meddle with since June? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I desired him to sit in the office, and that the out-door work should be done by other clerks—I forbade him to meddle with my money—I never bring an action in the Common Pleas if I can avoid it—an attorney always chooses what Court he will go into—I cannot take on myself to say, among eight hundred causes, that I may not have had one, two, or perhaps three causes in the Common Pleas, but I avoid the Common Pleas—they were not causes of my own, but as an agent-as proper, I never do certainly, but as agency, if a case has been ordered in the Common Pleas, of course we should do it—I may have brought actions there as agent, but I do not recollect—my books are burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you remember the cause of Brown <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Newell? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were three causes, I think the reason of that was it was a bankruptcy, and in case we lost one trial, we were to have the opinion of all the Courts on it—it was brought in the Exchequer, Common Pleas, and King's Bench—I have brought actions in the King's Bench—Mr. Bunce has had no interest in the business since the 19th of May, 1834—Mr. Blacklock is dead—he was appointed Master in the King's Bench, and left the firm—the prisoner had nothing to do with Common Law business at all—it is a thing he did not understand—he was very clever in his own department-bankruptcies I generally take myself—he was handy to any thing I wanted—he was three years and a quarter in my employ-towards tbeend of January, or beginning of February, I believe he was arrested, and he wrote me a letter requesting money—I did not receive the letter myself—he wrote to the clerks in the office, begging them to ask me to advance money to take him out of custody—they told me of it—I did not advance him money on that occasion, but I forbade him ever to come into my office again—he did come again after he came out of confinement, and I turned him out and sent him away—he wanted a private interview with me, and I would not grant it—he said he wanted to explain something—I said his explanation must be put in writing; I had forgiven him twice, and I was not going to forgive him a third time—he sent to me to know if I would see any attorney on his be<lb/>half, and he sent his brother to me to know if I would see a friend on his behalf—I afterwards saw Mr. Westmacott—he came to me to know the charge I had against the prisoner—that was some time in February—I have tried to recollect the date, and if it is right on the draft of some papers which have been saved, I think it was the 23rd of February, but Mr.; Westmacott can tell you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, on that occasion, charge the prisoner with having em<lb/>bezzled or taken away any of your money? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; I did not go before a Magistrate then—I was drawing a case, and the fire happened—I did not go before a Magistrate at all—I went before the Grand Jury, in March or April—it could not be March—I was too much engaged in consequence of the fire then-when I went before the Grand Jury, in April, I did not prefer the present bill—I think I preferred this bill the following Session, I think it was about the latter end of April or May.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you, in all that time, ask the prisoner for any account of these two guineas, or give him any opportunity of explanation? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; because his friend Mr. Westmacott "had told me I could not do otherwise than pro<lb/>secute—I told him the nature of the case, and he refused to have any thing</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200023"/>
               <p>to do with it—I did not give the prisoner any opportunity of explanation—I would not see him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you, was not an offer made, on the part of the prisoner, that he would go before any Magistrate, and enter into a full explanation of all matters? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not to me, certainly—I swear no such offer was made—I never saw anybody but his brother, and Mr. Westmacott—I never saw George Shaw the brother but once to speak to him after I discharged the prisoner—that was when he made the request that I would see Mr. Westmacott-neither George Shaw, nor Mr. Westmacott, told me that the prisoner was ready to appear before any Justice whatever to enter into an explanation of the transaction-George Shaw did not offer to pro<lb/>duce the prisoner, and to go before a Magistrate to answer any charge that I might have to make against him—he never said any thing of the kind-nor did anybody else ever make that offer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now, I ask you, did not Mr. Shaw, or Mr. Westmacott, offer to refer any doubt you might have about the prisoner's accounts to any gentleman in the profession? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Mr. Westmacott came with the officer for security—I think Mr. Westmacott very likely did offer to do so-but on entering into explanation Mr. Westmacott was of opinion it would be dangerous for us to enter into any thing of the kind—I think it was the 23rd of February, or perhaps a week after, that Mr. Westmacott told me so—we had two long interviews on the subject—I refused to have any thing to do with the prisoner, but not with any person on his behalf, for I saw Mr. Westmacott—it was never proffered to me to see any one else—the prisoner was in the employment of Mr. Smith when I became acquainted with him—it was not at my solicitation or request that he left Mr. Smith—he came to me in November, 1834—he stated that Mr. Smith had not behaved well, and he was then at liberty to leave him—I had a clerk named Edwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean you had not sent Edwards repeatedly to request him to come to you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I had sent one or two notes to see him in the spring of that year, hearing he wanted a situation—I did not send Edwards to him several times to request him to leave Mr. Smith and come to me—he came tome on the 1st of January, 1835—he never did his own business in my office in his own name—he has done business in my name, but on my ac<lb/>count, not on his own account—I have no such book as a Chancery ledger—there was a posting-book, but that is burnt—I had a book with a peen cover—there was a Chancery day-book and two others—the items were collected under different heads into the posting-book, and that has been burnt—I will show you what books I have—there are several green books, but I know the book you are inquiring about—that is burnt-in November, 1836, I took to posting all the books myself—the book which I posted is burnt—there was a heading in that book of entry, with the name of Shaw on the top of it, and there was the name of Pell-Pell's son is an articled clerk-Shaw was not an articled clerk—I have no posting-book here with, the name of Shaw in it—that was the only book which ever had his name in it—I can show you a spe<lb/>cimen of what was the way of doing business—I have brought the books that I have had since—I do business in the same way-here is one book which was saved—(<hi rend="italic">producing one partly burnt</hi>)—that is the prisoner's own posting-book, which was burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Do you mean to say that never to your knowledge, or in any way</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200024"/>
               <p>whatever, the prisoner practised on his own account in your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I gave him leave to defend himself in an action, hut nothing else—he never acted in my name—there are four articled clerks in my office, two are articled to Mr. Sherwood, and two to myself—they are under my control, and get their instructions from me—Mr. Sherwood is not a partner in any profits in my business—he is not a partner at all—he has no right to practise in my office, but I was very ill in 1835 and 1836, and that was the cause of the arrangement—the articled clerks pay premiums, which I take.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> So as to have as many articled clerks as the law allows? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> She knows that I received two hundred guineas last March, for one clerk articled to Mr. Sherwood—I know by law an attorney cannot take more than two articled clerks at a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Was this young man articled to Mr. Sherwood as a partner of yours, carrying on business in the partnership with you? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I think not, but I can send for the articles—Mr. Sherwood does not do business as an at<lb/>torney at all—I recollect the terms of it, because I altered the articles—he was articled to Mr. Sherwood, but to obey my commands—I do not know that Mr. Sherwood cannot act as an attorney—there is a clause in the Act of Parliament to fit this very case—it is the clause for regula<lb/>tion of the Courts—there is an exception in that Act for the holder of the situation, which Mr. Sherwood fills—he may practise, but he does not—the names of the four articled clerks are, George Pell, and George Massey Heath, articled to myself; and John Sherwood and Edward Lewis Mayor; articled to Mr. Sherwood—they are both articled to Mr. Sherwood-l con<lb/>sider Mr. Sherwood, jun. as the clerk of his father, obeying my com<lb/>mands, and working in my office—Mr. Sherwood has no share in the pro<lb/>fits, no control in the business.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now we will come to Mrs. Brewin. When did you first see her? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Not till after I discharged the prisoner—I preferred this bill in May—I saw Mrs. Brewin in March or April—I should think it was April—I went to her at her house at Hackney—I had never seen her before—I knew nothing of the business done in my office for her till Mr. Anderdon the Chancery Barrister's bill for fees came in, and then I found the name—I think that was soon after the fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What was that? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I discovered that a fee in Mrs. Brewin's case had not been paid, and that led to the discovery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Had you no knowledge of the case before Mr. Anderdon's bill for fees came in? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I had not found a case for his opinion among the papers of the prisoner—I knew nothing about her business, or how it was done, till I had a conference with Mr. Anderdon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Then will you swear she was ever your client at all, at any one moment of your life? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes; she was brought by Mrs. Cowperthwaite.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200025"/>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever prosecute or attempt to prosecute any other clerk of yours for embezzlement, as you call it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I never took one to Bow-street—I applied at Bow-street for a warrant against one of the name of Birch—that is about two years ago—the Magistrate refused the warrant—he said he thought it was a matter of account, and not embezzlement—he went away with the cash of the office without giving it to me—I think it was 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. or 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—it was not 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had not given me an account of every thing except 6<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.—he had only been in the office about fourteen days—he had done nothing during that time—he charged a salary I had never greed to give him, and so set it off—he left all the work undone in the office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I ask you again, whether you did not tell Mr. Westmacott you had an account opened under the head of Shaw, with your knowledge, and that you had allowed him to practise in your name? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No—I admitted that there was an account in his name—I did not tell him I allowed the pri<lb/>soner to practise in my name—I explained to him how it was—I think it is very likely I told Mr. Westmacott that I allowed the prisoner to intro<lb/>duce one or two matters into the office—he was not to have the profits—he was to introduce them for his own accommodation—he supplied his re<lb/>lations with law at my expense—there was one case of Lee I gave him leave to defend at my expense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> You say he was not to have the profits? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; he never received a farthing in his life out of any of the rubbish he brought in—I believe I received what there was—I never gave him leave except in the case of Wallis <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Philpotts, which forms one of the indictments on the present occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR. ADOLPHUS</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Pray did you ever say to any one that you were determined to have the prisoner in Newgate? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; never to any one—I said I had taken the opinion of counsel, and I was to prosecute him—that I had the opinion of Sir John Campbell and Mr. Bodkin—the prisoner knew it was to be so—Mr. Westmacott told him—I went with an officer and apprehended him at his own lodgings—he had not ran away—he left word where he was living in case I wanted him—he wrote me an impudent letter telling me where he was to be found, and there he was found.</p>
               <p>

               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200034"/>
               <p>cannot say whether I have said that before or not—the prisoner was not in the habit of transacting business on his own account in the office-nobody did so but Mr. Vincent—I went into the office in 1834—he never, to my knowledge, did any business in the office on his own account—he never did business for his own clients in the name of the firm—I will swear I know nothing about that—there was a book kept in the office with an account of causes, brought into the office by Shaw—that account was known to Mr. Vincent-a page of that book contained a list of causes brought into the office by Shaw—Mr. Vincent knew that—I do not know that they were called Shaw's causes—I never called them so—they were not called so—we called them by the names of the causes—I will not swear I never heard Mr. Vincent call them Shaw's causes—I might have done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How many of those causes were there about the time he was arrested? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> There were Bradley and Bradley, Wallis and Philpott, and Lee and Shaw—I believe those were all the Chancery causes—there were some writs he brought in—there might be eight or ten since he was in the office—I can<lb/>not say how many there were when he was arrested—I am not in the Common Law office—I think there were not so many as ten or twelve—there might be eight or nine—Mr. Vincent's clerks used to work them—I was not in the habit of receiving money from clients—I have received money—it was not usual for the clerks to receive money—they have done so when Mr. Vincent was out of the way—I did not know of the bill of 4<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 0<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. of Mr. Bigg's till after Shaw went from the office, or that then had been such work done—it was before I went into the Chancery office—the prisoner was managing clerk, and I was a junior—that was the only instruction I got—I had to find out what I could myself—there was no<lb/>body in the office to instruct me-before this time it had been the custom to hand in to Mr. Vincent pieces of paper with sums of money received from different parties—I have done so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Now after doing so, has he forgotten it, and come and asked what it was? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Never to me—I have heard him come into the office and asked others what that money was—I have not heard him say he has lost the paper, and forgotten all about it—I have known such a thing as bills sent down to clients, and they have written up to say the money had been paid—I never heard from Mr. Vincent that he had received it and forgotten it—I never read an answer to that effect—I am not aware that the prisoner had any opportunity of accounting to Mr. Vincent, or giving any explanation, after he had been arrested.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">MR.

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Walthamstow. On Wednesday the 20th of June, I was at the Crooked Billet, at Walthamstow, fetching water from there, about six or seven o'clock in the evening—I saw the deceased James Ginns there—I did not know him before—he was sitting down on a bench outside the house, alone, with a pot of porter by his side—I saw the prisoner, who I knew before by sight, standing in front of the deceased, within two or three feet of him—I did not hear the deceased say any thing to him, but the prisoner told him he saw some lice crawling about him—the deceased said, if he was lousy it was unknown to him—he was an old man, between seventy and eighty—that was all I heard pass then—I went away with my water, and came back again a few minutes, and the old man was then standing, and the prisoner was standing before him—I saw the prisoner strike him twice on his face with his fist—they were talking, at least the prisoner was <hi rend="italic">blowing him up</hi>, calling him a dirty old fellow, and telling him again about being lousy—I did not hear the old man say any thing, nor see him do any thing, nor offer to strike the prisoner at all—the prisoner hit him most violently on the nose and on the cheek—after that the old man went away for half an hour or an hour, and came back again-as I was in my own yard I saw him walking away from the Crooked Billet, and the prisoner came behind him, caught him by his shoulder, turned him round, and threw him down-whether it was done by his foot or how, I cannot tell, but the old man laid there, and was not able to get up—he was carried to his seat by two or three people, and the prisoner either went into the tap-room or stood against the door—I afterwards saw the old man at the hospital—I am sure it was the same man—the prisoner was rather the worse for liquor, but not drunk—he knew what he was doing.</p>

On the 20th of June, I went to the Crooked Billet late at night, and found Ginns sitting on the seat outside the door, between seven and eight o'clock—he appeared very bad, and could not move off the seat-a young man took and carried him into the stable, and a surgeon was sent for, who came and ordered him to be taken to the hospital—I assisted the young man in carrying him to the hospital—we started about twelve o'clock at night—I afterwards saw him dead—it was the same man—I knew his name to be James Ginns—I never saw him before.</p>

On Wednesday, the 20th of June, I was at the Crooked Billet, between six and seven o'clock, and saw the deceased there sitting outside, drinking a pint of beer—I never saw him before—he did not appear the worse for liquor—I went into the tap-room and saw the prisoner there—the tap-room window opens out to where the old man was sitting—I heard the prisoner ask him to give him some beer—I did not hear the old man make any reply-short time after the old man stood up, and the prisoner came out of the tap-room and struck him twice in the face—I had heard nothing more pass between them before he went out—the prisoner took the old man's stick away from him—he walked with a stick, as he was infirm—I did not have any thing said by the old man before the prisoner struck him nor after—he got his stick back again some time after, and was going away—the prisoner followed him after he got about twenty yards away from the house, went behind him, took hold of his collar, tripped him up with his foot, and threw him up—he fell sideways on his thigh or hip, I cannot say which—he ap<lb/>peared to fall very heavy—after he fell, he told the prisoner he ought to be ashamed of himself for striking an old man—he said he was quite sure that either his thigh or hip was broken—the prisoner went back again to the house—he was a little the worse for liquor.</p>

I am an assistant-surgeon at the London Hospital I saw the deceased, James Ginns, at the hospital, on the morning of the 21st of June, about eight or ten hours after he was brought there—I did not see him at the time he was brought in—he had got a broken thigh bone—that was all the injury I could see—he lived about seven weeks, and died from mortification, in consequence of the broken bone-every thing was done for him in the hospital that possibly could be done—the fracture was, in all probability, the effect of a fall—I examined the body after death more particularly—I observed that the thigh bone was broken very high up, close to the hip, and there was mortification and abscess around it to a con<lb/>siderable extent, and one portion of the bone was driven into the other—the mortification was quite sufficient to occasion death—the setting of the thigh was attended to by two pupils who superintend the accidents in the night-I</p>

               <p>saw it in the morning—it had been attended to, and put in a proper position-every thing had been done that could be done—I attribute his death solely on the mortification, which was the result of the broken bone-a younger man would in all probability have escaped, but at his time of life it was lot at all probable—I watched him very closely, almost from day to day till he died—the breaking of the thigh bone so high always implies a great deal of force—the thigh bone had been properly set before I saw it, and every thing had been done that was required-a very vigorous constitution night got well under it—I learnt his name was James Ginns at the time of the inquest—the Magistrate, Mr. Davis, attended the deceased at the hospital before his death—he is not here—I do not know his hand<lb/>writing—I did not address the deceased by the name of Ginns, nor did I near anybody else do so-but the name of every patient is taken when they come into the hospital, and written over their bed, and his name was over in bed—he had friends come to see him, I believe—I cannot swear what came was over the deceased's bed, but a name is invariably put over a patient's bed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in High-street, Poplar, and am a draper. The prisoner was in my service-in consequence of circumstances I marked a half-crown, a shilling, and a sixpence, on the 16th of July, I gave it to my wife, and directed her what to do with it—I went from home about two o'clock—I came home about half-past five o'clock, and then called the pri<lb/>soner—I desired him to empty his pockets, and when he put a portion of the coin on the table I saw one shilling, marked with the letter "L"—I went for a policeman, and a half-crown was found on him, and a sixpence, all stamped with the letter "L"—that was the money that I had stamped and given to my wife.</p>

               <p>I described as a manor farm, and land situated at Wadsworth, in the west Riding of York—I told him I had a quarter share at the death of my father, who was aged sixty-four or sixty-five—he inquired the sum I wanted—I told him 150<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—he said he had no doubt he could obtain that sum for me—he said he had clients, making use of their names, living at Ips wich, who would purchase the property, and he had no doubt they would give me that sum—he desired me to call again in a few days—I did so, and saw him—he said he had seen his clients, and that he could not give me that, but he would give me 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which I agreed to—he said he would give it me, part in money, and part in a bill at two months—I agreed to that, and left—I was desired to call again, which I did a few days afterwards—he then said he had heard from his clients, who not having any money at their command, would give me a 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bill, or two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—that was the third time I called, which was about a week or a fortnight after the second time—I agreed to take two 50<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. bills—he did not give me them on that occasion—on the next visit to Jewin-street, which was the latter part of November, when I went into the front-parlour, or office, I saw two bills lying on the table—the prisoner then said, "I have received the bills from my clients in the country," meaning Ipswich—he produced them—they were ready prepared, with the exception of my signature as the drawer, on the supposed acceptor—this is one of the bills he so produced—(<hi rend="italic">looking at one</hi>)—I looked at them—I inquired who this "Nicholson and Co.' the acceptor, was, and what they were—he told me they were merchants—I inquired what merchants—he answered, "general merchants," and that they resided at Ipswich, and were highly respectable men, and the bills would be paid on the day they were due—there was no address on the bill, but "3, Jewin-court, Jewin-street," as their address—I inquired how I was that the address was "Jewin-court," when he had just informed me they lived at Ipswich—he said they lived at Ipswich, and they would be in town, and the bills would be paid at Praed and Co., bank<lb/>ers, Fleet-street, where they were made payable—he then brought the bills from the front parlour to the back, where I saw Mr. Adolphus Warres, Attorney at Law, and Mr. Lewis the clerk—the latter two persons left the back and went into the front parlour, and the prisoner brought the two bills to me, and, laying them on the table, said, "Put your name there as the drawer"—I did so—we then went into the front parlour, where I saw a parchment lying on the table-when we went in, the two persons left, and went into the back parlour—they were then called into the front par<lb/>lour—I then signed the said deed or parchment—one deed, and a memorial—they were not read over to me before I signed them, nor was I asked to have them read—after I had signed the bills were delivered to me by the prisoner in the presence of the two other persons—he said, when he delivered them to me, "Now, here are two bills as good as the Bank of England," and that they would be paid on the day they were due—the prisoner and myself then returned into the back parlour again, and after that, he took a sovereign out of his pocket, saying, "I will lend you this out of my pocket, which you can repay me when the bills are met"—that was in the back parlour—we then went to a public-house at the corner of Jewin-street, where we had some refreshment, for which the prisoner paid—he then named about the bills being good, and not to go and fool them away, for they were as good as the Bank of England-when the bills became due I presented them at Praed and Co's., but they were not paid—consequence</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> What means had you of living from the time yon went to parl-street, up to your coming to Ann-street? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That which was afforded me by my father—I told you my father supported me in the first instance—that is the way in which I got, and still get my living—the only way—I do not get it in a dishonest way—I get it only by support I have from my father—I do not get it by any sort of work—I live by my father's support alone.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you ever had money from the prisoner? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Money has passed between our hands.

               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you give the prisoner authority to put up this property by public auction? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did—I first saw the prisoner in October or Novem<lb/>ber, last twelvemonth, about that time—I cannot tell what month it was in—I unfortunately kept no memorandum of these transactions—I have other property besides this coming to me at the death of my father, rever<lb/>sionary property—I do not live in a secluded way—I have played, and believe all of us have more or less—I think you are playing on my feelings now—I do not feel myself bound to answer whether I have played a good deal—I am twenty-nine years of age—I don't feel myself bound to tell you when I left my father's roof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I think I understand you to say you put your name to the deed and a receipt for 298<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. without reading it? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I did not know the sum I put my name to—I supposed it was 100<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I never saw the consideration money—I could have read the figures, but I did not observe them—I don't believe the figures were there—they could be added after-Warren and Lewis were present when I put my name to it—I do not feel myself bound to tell you whether I applied to anybody else to dispose of the property, now how many persons I applied to, or how many persons I unsuccessfully ap<lb/>plied to—I do not know who furnished the prisoner with the schedule of the land—he has been up to my father's, and he has a plan of the estate—he has been once to my father's—my father knew I was about getting money on the property.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> I forget how long it is since you swore you always paid your way? I said from Queen-street, where I only staid two days—I paid my say for two days—I do not feel myself bound to say how many lodgings have gone away from without paying my rent—I will not answer—after executing the deed I only received these papers, which are no use to me, and how could it pay several pounds which I was in debt?—I do not feel would to say how many pounds I was in debt—I have always endeavoured pay my way—my circumstances have remained the same since I exe<lb/>cuted the deed as before—I was pressed for money at that time—I put my name as drawer to these bills, on the day I signed the deed—I read the bills, and asked several questions about them—I took particular notice of them—they were dated, November 23rd-when I signed the deed, I did not exactly notice the date of it—I was not aware of the date of the deed, till I saw it at Hatton Garden-had I known the day on which I signed the deed, was the 5th of December, I should then have made more inquiry respecting the date of the bills, being the 23rd of November—I believe I executed the deed about the 5th of December—I signed the bills the same day I received them—that was the day I executed the deed-as I said before, the deed not having been read over, I did not know whether it did not bear the same date as the bills—I first went to Praed's banking-house, on the 21st or 22nd of January last, and I went the second time three days after—I think the first time was on Monday, and Thursday was the second time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you ever go to see Mr. Crook the auctioneer, to see if he could sell "the property? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Yes-being recommended by the prisoner—I went once to Mr. Crook—I do not remember whether that was in October last year—I made one application to get the bills discounted—I cannot exactly state the person's name to whom I applied, but he re<lb/>sides in a turning out of Holborn—I did not see him before I went to him for that purpose—I have seen him since, passing by—I do not know the name of the court—it is a turning leading into Lincolns'-inn-fields—it is in Turnstile—it is a tailor's shop—it was a young man in the shop I went to—I cannot positively say whether he was the master or the fore<lb/>man—I was not referred to that young man by any one—I suppose it was some little time after I took the bills, that I went—I cannot say how soon after—I have applied to somebody else—I cannot exactly recollect the day I went to the person to discount the bills—it was not a month after I signed them—I cannot answer whether it was a fortnight or a week, it was under a month—I cannot say nearer—it was not a person I knew.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> How came you to go to him? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> I was promiscuously passing by and saw the party there—I went into the shop and asked him to discount the bills—the tailor's shop—I inquired if they did business in that way—He was the door and asked if I wished to buy any thing—I said, "I am not in want of any thing at present, but have you plenty of money in the house?"—he said, "Yes, I have a little, I have got enough for you; how much do you want?"—I said, "Why I only want a hundred, a couple of fifties;" and there is something for you to laugh at—I said if he had money in the house, as he said he had, I would have no objection to take a</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Why not take ft out this year? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> That is a question for my own consideration—I took it out myself in 1836, with my own hand, and also in 1835, and every year besides 1837—I took it out myself since I have practised in town, which has been six or seven years—I do not know who the house in Jewin-court belongs to—the prisoner was the housekeeper there—I knew him as housekeeper there about a couple of months before I took an office there—I did not pay him rent or a salary—the principal consideration with me was to have an office free of any charge—he was paid from certain profits arising out of any business he could procure—he received the whole of the profits of any business he could get, except the 12<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. for my certificate-an arrangement was made when I went there that he was to receive two-thirds of the profits, and I one-third, but that was never carried into effect—there was nobody else with whom I made the same arrangement, nor ever has been—I have never had any account of business from the prisoner—I have asked him for one, but he always put me off,</p>

                  </hi>, senior. I am a lieutenant in the Militia, on half-pay, and live in Norland-place, near Nottinghill, Kensington. On Saturday, the 21st of July, I went out to take a walk with two of my children, a little girl rather more than nine, and a boy rather more than ten-as I returned, I came down a lane at the back of Lord Holland's park—on coming to a turning leading into Camden-road, I saw a man sitting on a basket—he could look down the lane, and see into the Camden-road—after passing him, I got to a bend in the lane, some distance further up—I was conversing with the little girl on my right, and on raising my head, I first saw the prisoner close to me, standing with his face to me-his hands were apparently down—I did not notice any thing in his hand at the moment—the moment he discovered that I saw him, he placed himself before me, and said, "Your money, sir"—he had two pistols, one in each hand—I was fearful, if he fired, he might kill the children, and said, "Money! no, indeed!"—I pushed the children away on one side, and sprang forward and tried to disarm him-and he fired the pistol in his left hand-as I sprang at him I felt the ball strike me a tremendous blow, and felt I was wounded before I reached his right hand, and grasped the other pistol—I was wounded in the upper part of the right thigh—I still went towards him, and succeeded in getting the other pistol from his right hand—I presented it at his head, and then he tore from me—we had rather a sharp struggle, and on my putting the pistol to his head, he ran away directly towards where the man was sitting—I called out, "Stop him"—the man took up his basket, and ran away in the same direction as the prisoner did—I saw the prisoner in custody in about ten minutes after, and identified him immediately—I am certain it was him—I attempted to discharge the pistol I took from him as he was running off, but it missed fire—I after<lb/>wards looked at the part of my dress where the ball struck, and found my trowsers were cut—I had sovereigns in one pocket of my purse, and silver in the other—my pocket was cut at the part where the ball was received, and the money protruded—my purse was cut, and a bruise caused by the blow, a very severe one—I was present when the prisoner was searched, and saw taken from him some bullets, two charges of powder, and some powder in a phial, some pawnbroker's duplicates, and a bludgeon from his right-hand pocket—he was a perfect stranger to me.</p>

                  </hi>. I now live with Mr. Penny, the Inspector of Police in Clerkenwell-before I came to London I lived with ray uncle at Great Burford, in Bedfordshire—I came to town in the wagon, and I arrived here on the last day of June, between five and six o'clock in the morning—I was set down at the wagon-office, in St. John-street—I endeavoured to get a place of service—I went to a laundress, and they were not up—I afterwards went into a public-house which was open—I there saw the pri<lb/>soner Neville—she said she was a country person, and her husband had been dead seven years, and she invited me to go to her house to breakfast—I had brought a trunk with me to town, containing my clothes, as stated in the in<lb/>dictment-most of them were new things, and were worth about 3<hi rend="italic">l</hi>.—I had bought them myself, and I had 2<hi rend="italic">l</hi>. 13<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. in money in my pocket—I went with Neville to her house, and carried my box with me almost all the way, and she took it and carried it up stairs-when I got there, the prisoner Chapman got up and let me in—I found her lying in bed, ill—I laid down for about an hour in the same room my trunk was in—I then got up and had breakfast—I saw all the four prisoners at breakfast-Austin and the black girl Jones came up while I and Neville and Chapman were at break-fast, and took breakfast along with us—after breakfast Neville asked me to lend her a shilling to buy her some coals, and I lent her one—my money was loose in my pocket-Chapman took the shilling, and went for the coals, and the boy brought them up while I was in the room-Neville then told me to go out for a walk with Austin (who, she said, was her brother) and Jones, while she cleaned up her room—she said there were such rogues in London, if I did not leave what money I had in my pocket, they would take it away from me—I took my pocket off, and put it, money and all, into my box in her room—the box was not locked or corded; it was tied up in a brown shawl—I had seen my money in the morning when I paid my fare in the wagon—I had three half-crowns, five shillings and sixpence, and two sovereigns-except the shilling I lent Neville, the rest was in the box-Austin, Jones, and I then went out, and walked about for three hours-Austin said he could tell me of some work—he knew a friend who could get me plenty of good work—we went into a public-house, and he wrote a letter there to get me a situation, and said I might mention his name when I got there—I have got the letter—I left the pub<lb/>lic-house with him and Jones—she did not hear what he said about the letter, as she was gone out—she came in again just as we came out of the public-house—I do not know that she heard any of the conversation about the letter—we all three came away together, and Austin said to me, "Young woman, don't you think you can find your way back again to Neville's room?"—I said, "No, I am quite a stranger in town, and don't think I can"-Jones said she had been cook eleven years in a family, and was going out for half a day, and should get 5<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. and plenty of broken victuals, and she must leave me—they then left me—I told Austin I wanted to find Neville's house, to get some clothes and money—he went with me, and pre<lb/>tended to show me into Neville's room—he left me at the bottom of the stairs, and said, "That is the room, go up there, young woman"—he then went away—I did not know it was not Neville's room till I went up stairs, and found nothing but shoemakers there-when I came down he was gone—Jones</p>

               <p>had gone before—I was in the street, crying—I went into the next house—they called the policeman over to me—I told them how I had been served—they took me to the station-house, and then I went to look for Neville's house, but could not find it—at last I went back to the station-house, and they sent me into the country-again, to my uncle's-when I had been there a week, Mr. Penny came, and brought me to town, and I have been there ever since, and he has taken me into his service—I went before the Magistrate, and have got most all of my clothes and some money back.</p>

I have known Austin for years—I have washed for him, and spoken to him from time to time—on the Sunday my sister (the prisoner Chapman) wrote to my husband, and I heard of this—on the Wednesday following I met Austin in Cow-lane, about nine o'clock in the morning—he stopped me, and asked where I was going—I told him I was going to work—he said, "A pretty concern about your sister"—I said, "What is it?" pretending to be ignorant of it all—I said, "I heard she was taken up for being tipsy"—he said "It is more than that, I am afraid to be here—I expect to be taken every minute; the officers are after me"—I said, "Have you any thing to do with it?"—he said, "Yes"—we went into the Golden Ball—he told me that on Saturday morning a country girl came from the country, and was brought into my sister's place—he got talking to her, put his arm round her waist, and took from her pocket two sixpences, and eight-pence—he thought the girl felt him do it, and he rolled it up, and put it into her box—he then got into conversation with her, and asked her to take a walk, and he and the black girl went out with her—that in conversation with her, he said, what a foolish girl she was to come to London without money or friends, and she replied, she had brought two sovereigns and a half, and a five shilling piece, besides other small silver with her—he said he left her then, came into the room, broke the box open, and made away with her clothes, and took the money away—I then said I must go to work—I went out, called Scott, a city-policeman, and gave him into custody—he said the best way to make away with the box was by burning it, and he said it was burnt; and Jones told me it was burnt on the Monday.</p>

On the 11th of July I was at Zion House, the Duke of Northumberland's—there was a fete there—the company commenced arriving between three and four o'clock-about seven o'clock in the afternoon I was in tbeentrance hall the public were not allowed to come there-lam house-carpenter—I saw the prisoner in tbeentrance hall, also my wife and mother-in-law-no one else—I observed this shawl in the prisoner's parasol, but so much secreted that I could scarcely see one corner of it—her parasol was closely shot up, and close under the arm—I said I would call the police—she begged of me not to call the police, and seemed very much irritated indeed—I called the police in, and she readily gave me the shawl out of the parasol, and started across the hall towards the vestibule door, she ran up five or six steps, crossed</p>

                  </hi>. I am the wife of the last witness. I was at this fete-about seven or eight o'clock in the evening I saw Mrs. Hay pick up the shawl—it was at tbeentrance hall, between the door and the vestibule steps—the steps are in tbeentrance hall, and led up into the vestibule—I saw her place it in her parasol in a very hurried manner, and then go towards the hall door, to go out—she was in the act of going out—my husband was at tbeentrance hall door—he turned round to come back to me, and she said, "Can I go out this way, Sir?"—he said, "I dare say you can, Ma'am"—I told him the woman had got a shawl in her parasol.</p>

On Friday the 20th of July, I put a £5 Bank note into my purse in the top drawer in Mrs. Cook's bed-room—I went to Brentford on the Saturday following—I returned in the evening—I looked into the drawer, and found three £5 notes were left in the purse, and one had been taken out—Mrs. Cook spoke to the prisoner, and she said she had never seen such a thing since she had been in the house.</p>

I was coming out of New Gravel-lane on the 15th of July, between six and seven o'clock, and met the prisoner—I had two half-crowns, two shil<lb/>lings, and two sixpences—he said, where was I going?—I said, "To a coffee-shop"—he said he had some bread—I said, if he came with me I would give him a half-pint of coffee—I drank mine, and laid my head down and fell asleep-in about ten minutes afterwards I caught his hand coming out of my pocket—my money was gone, and a hole cot in my pocket—I charged him with robbing me when I saw the policeman, in about a quarter of an hour-no other man could have taken my money but him—there was no other man on that side the box—there was a man asleep on the other side—I knew the prisoner a long time before—I had no quarrel with him.</p>

About two o'clock that afternoon I was coming out of my room, and saw the prisoner going out with these things—I asked what he wanted—he said a person of the name of Lush—I said no such person lived there—I then asked what he wanted of him—he said he bad got a waistcoat for him—I asked him to let me look at it—I found it was my brother's waistcoat, and the towel—I stopped him and the things—the prosecutor is my brother.</p>

On the evening of the 11th of July I was on the steps about half-past seven o'clock—we had a brass lathe there—I received information, and went after the prisoner—I found him in our boxes—I told him he was wanted outside, he came and took the lathe from under his coat, and threw it down—it was about three minutes from the time I missed it till he threw it down.</p>

                  </hi>. I am house-surgeon of St. Bartholomew's Hospital. Jones was brought in between seven and eight o'clock on the evening of the 27th of April, with a severe compound fracture of the right leg—the bones were broken, and the integuments wounded—it was a very severe injury—he had repeated attacks of inflammation of the leg, and suppuration took place on the separation of the different parts of bone that came away—he remained in a state of great danger for some time, and then subsequently improved a little-about a week previous to his death, an attack of erysipelas commenced in the injured leg, which spread rapidly up the thigh—he died on the 21st of August, between twelve and one o'clock—the erysipelas was the immediate cause of death, brought on by the injury, the fracture of the leg—I feel confident of it, more particu<lb/>larly, having made a post mortem examination of the limb.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner's Defence</hi>. I certainly was struck first by Jones, and when I got on my legs I went to strike him, but I had no idea of so serious an accident—I believe the fall was occasioned by his falling over the handle of the presses-Cleaver struck me three or four times before I hit Jones, while I was attempting to strike at him.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a victualler, and live in the parish of St. Andrew's, Holborn. On the night of the 26th of July, between two and three o'clock, I was disturbed by an alarm that thieves were in the house—I immediately ran down stairs, and found the door leading from the yard into the house broken open—I had fastened it myself the night before with bolts—the bolts were forced off by main force—I found the private door leading into the pas<lb/>sage open—that is another door leading into Fox-court—I had fastened it myself the night before with a bolt, a bar, and a chain—it had been unfastened inside-no violence had been used to that—it had been unfastened as I should have done it myself—on discovering that open I found an officer, another man, and the prisoner, standing at the door, in Fox-court, which leads from Brook-street into Gray's Inn-lane—my house is in Brook-street—the con<lb/>stable came inside, and we examined the place-nothing was said at the door in the prisoner's hearing, to my knowledge—we found another door had been attempted to get into the parlour—we saw where some one had been trying to force it open—some kind of bar had broken the wood away of the door leading to the parlour—there were marks on the door-post, as if an in<lb/>strument had been put in to force it open—we afterwards went into the yard, to found an attempt had been made underneath the window—it seemed to have forced through the wooden wall which is the partition of the dwelling-house—after that I found a pane of glass broken—that was all I observed-nothing was said to the prisoner in my presence, but he was in custody.</p>

                  </hi>. I lodge in the prosecutor's house. I re<lb/>member returning home on the night in question about three o'clock-when I got home I rang the bell at the private door in Fox-court—I stood about a minute, and then heard something slip from the back wall behind, it sounded like somebody dropping from the wall, which is in Fox-court—I vent round to the corner immediately to see how the noise was occasioned—it is but a small angle-when I got round that corner I saw the prisoner in the act of getting up from the pavement—he had been down on the ground—the wall he came over separates the yard from the court—I did not see him come over the wall—I heard him fall from it—it is between Fox-court and the yard—it is about ten feet high—he was about five feet from the back door leading into the yard—I called on him to surrender, and give an account of himself-as soon as he got up he ran away from me, in indirection of Gray's Inn-lane—I called on him to stop and give an account of himself, which he said he would not-his precise expression I cannot recollect, but it was to the effect that he would not—I rather think it was that he would see me d-d first—he ran on—I ran after him about twenty yards, and then came close on him-when he found that I gained close on him, he turned round and put himself in a threatening position—he had an instrument in his hand, and with the darkness of the morning, I could not distinguish what it was, but it appeared to me, as he held it under his arm, concealing part of it, to be</p>

               <p>like the barrel of a pistol—he held it towards me, and told me to keep off—I was rather alarmed, and did as he required me—I did not rush imme<lb/>diately on him, and then he ran away again, through several courts—I fol<lb/>lowed him, and called "Police"-a policeman came up, and joined in the pursuit—we then came into Brook-street—I heard something fall on the pavement like iron or steel—it appeared to be thrown from the prisoner's hand—the policeman called out, "Keep him in sight, and I will pick this up"—we ran through several more courts, which I never went through before, and ultimately into Gloucester-court, Holborn, without coming into Holborn—I there overtook him, sufficiently to stop him, and he put him<lb/>self in a fighting position, but I detained him there till the policeman arrived, and he was taken into custody—we brought him back to Mr. Sams's door, and Mr. Sams was then at his door—I accompanied the prisoner and policeman to the station-house—I only lost sight of him at the times he went round the corners of the courts—he was not ten yards before me all the way—I pursued, and saw nobody before me but him and the policeman—he slipped round the corners very quickly-as soon as I got round the corner, I saw him still running before me.</p>

The prisoner lodged with me about five months up to the time in question—he left on Sunday the 15th, when he was taken into custody by the police-while he lodged with me I missed a great many things-seven or eight shirts, and as many silk handkerchiefs, eight sovereigns in a purse, and two handkerchiefs—I had no suspicion of him till Sunday evening, when about five o'clock I went up stairs to my bed-room and found the kitchen-maid there—I asked if she had untied a bundle which came from the wash—she said, "No"—I missed a shirt from the bundle, and two shirts from a drawer, which was safe on Saturday morning, and there being no strangers in the house I made inquiry, searched several rooms and found nothing—the prisoner retired to bed before dark—we tapped at his door to search the room—he would not open it, but I heard his window open, and some things were brought in-doors by the policeman and other people—he was taken to the station-house, and my purse, which had contained eight sovereigns, was found upon him—I had lost sixty pounds that same day from our money cupboard—he has heard me say the first person I found robbing I should certainly prosecute, as a female servant had robbed me of fifty pounds worth of goods.</p>

                  </hi>. I was on duty in the Kingsland-road, on the 13th about a quarter before six o'clock. I met the prisoner coming from towards Tottenham, with a large bundle flung over his shoulder, and a bottle of water—I asked him what he had got—he said "Water"—I said, "I mean what is in the bundle?"—he said "Clothes"—I put my hand to it, and found it soft and very heavy—I took him to the station-house, and he owned he had some meat—I searched him, and found a sharpening-stone, with tar rope, and smears of blood on it—I found nine or ten pieces of beef in the bundle, and two kidneys—he said a man gave it him on the road—I took off his coat, and found his arms and elbows stained with blood-information came from Tottenham that a cow had been slaughtered—I went there, and found the cow lying with its entrails all out, and the kidneys gone—I compared the meat with</p>

               <p>the animal it appeared to have come from it, and the sacking and tar rope corresponded with the sacking and rope he had—I do not know whether there was any deficiency when I applied what the prisoner had to the animal-a butcher examined the animal—the heart laid by the side of it—the sacking found on him corresponded with what was in the shed.</p>

                  </hi>. I live at the Wellington, in Uxbridge. On Sun<lb/>day the 19th of June, I was in the George Inn-yard, about nine o'clock in the evening, with the female prisoner—I had met her in High-street-sbeenticed me into the field—we were on the ground—I had not been there two minutes before the two male prisoners, Cocking and Buggey, came there, and the man Cocking caught hold of me—I jumped up and was knocked down again directly, and Cocking, the man, struck me several times-Buggey assisted him, and struck at me several times, but did not hit me—I warded his blows off—my hat was carried away—I can<lb/>not say who by, but it was found on Buggey-also a pair of gloves, five shillings and seven-pence-at the time I was in the George yard I saw no persons but the three prisoners—I did not see the police-sergeant till</p>

               <p>after it happened—the three prisoners ran away directly—the woman ran away first, and after the men had stopped behind and struck me, they went away also—I cannot say which took my money—I only missed it—I cannot say whether any hand was thrust into my pocket—I received a blow on my face, the swelling has not gone down yet—I went immediately to Ux<lb/>bridge, and stated the case to Sergeant Cooper, I went with him and met both the male prisoners, and Buggey had my hat on his head—I de<lb/>scribed the marks on it before the policeman took it off—he took Buggey in custody—I took Cocking, and they were taken to the station-house—the hat was produced to me—this is the hat—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—the gloves have been found by the police-sergeant—these are them.</p>

On the night of the 19th of August, I saw the prosecutor about half-past nine o'clock, and in consequence of information, I accompanied him down the street, and met both the male prisoners coming up the street—I and the prosecutor were passing under a lamp, I believe they saw us coming, and Buggey immediately crossed over the road at a quick pace—I told the prosecutor to lay hold of Cocking—I crossed and took Buggey, and took him to the station-house—the prosecutor said, "That man had a cap on when he assaulted me, and he has now a hat-if it is mine it has 'Artis, Bond-street', in it"—I took it off and there was the name in it, and he iden<lb/>tified it—I took the prisoners to the station-house—I afterwards saw the female going down Uxbridge in company with another prostitute, with a shawl over her head—I could hardly see her face, but knew her before—I lilted the shawl on one side, and took her—I had not seen the woman with the prisoners that evening—I asked Ann Cocking where her bonnet was—the said she had left it at the Jolly Ostlers.</p>

I am valet and groom to Mr. Henry Frederick Bonham, who is a captain in that re<lb/>giment—he was quartered at Derby—I packed up his clothes and things—I put the watch into his portmanteau, with his shirts, waistcoats, and hand-kerchiefs, about the 14th of June—the trunk was to go by a baggage-cart, which was to go to Hounslow—it arrived at Hounslow, on or about the 22nd, I should think; the portmanteau I put the watch into was locked, and buckled with three buckles—I had the key—I am sure I locked it—when it arrived it was at an inn in the town—it was fastened down except the rivet which fastened the catch in the lock, but I could not tell that till I opened the strap over the lock—on opening it I missed the watch out of the sleeve of his pelisse—this is it—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>)—I know it to be my master's—the prisoner belongs to the regiment, and was assisting me on the road—I did not go with the cart—I had to attend my master and to do the horses, and he assisted me-at Watford my master wished me to come on to London to get him a bed, and the prisoner was left to see those things put on the cart—I came to town with two of my master's horses—he was at Watford on or about the 22nd of June—I cannot say what time he had the loading of the goods into the cart, it was after I left Watford—I left at six o'clock in the morning.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a gardener, and live at Hendon. On the 12th of August I was coming from Hendon about twelve o'clock at night—I saw the prisoner in High-street, Hampstead—he was a stranger to me—he asked me where I was going—I said I was going to London, through Portland-town—he said, "I am going to St. John's Wood, and we will walk together"—I said, "That is as you please"—he said, "We may as well have some beer first"—I said, "No; the houses are all shut up"—he said, "Here is a light here, we can get some"—I said, "No; it is a pri<lb/>vate house"—we came out of the town, and in going along by the second field, he said, "I have often heard of people being robbed, what money have you got about you?"—I said, "Five or six shillings"-"Pull it out," he said, and "I shall see what you have got"—I did so, and he caught my fingers with his left hand, and took the money out with his right—I asked him to give it me again—he said no; he should not till he came to St. John's Wood, and then he should know that I had got it—when we got near St. John's Wood, through the toll-bar gate, I asked him again—he said he would not give it me—he made a start, and went to get over agate—I caught him—he fell over into the field, and before I could get over, he was up and gone—I called "Police"-a policeman came up, and I told him I had been robbed by a soldier, who had gone across the field—the policeman said, "I will go over into the field, and you go to the bot<lb/>tom of this road, where you will see another policeman, and tell him to stop there"—I went on, and as I did not see a policeman for a few minutes, I laid down under the wall—I saw the prisoner come by me, and go up a turning which had no thoroughfare—he turned back and went on the road—I followed him till we came to a policeman, and gave him in charge—I am satisfied he is the same man.</p>

I am very, very sorry when I heard of this, and I am surprised you would take it upon yourselves to apprehend him so suddenly, without acquainting me with a letter, to know if all is correct or not. I hope, Gentlemen, for the sake of myself, and the respectability of their family, which for the last twenty years me and my brother Henry has been acquainted with them, that you will immediately, after you receive this, go to the Magistrates and get him liberated immediately from that dreadful punishment. It is a matter of impossibility for him to forge such a thing as that. How was he to know that I had any connexion with your bank? You have now de<lb/>tained him a week past the time, he ought to have been at home on Fri<lb/>day last. Consider, he was sent from here to London to transact business for his uncle, Mr. Jackson, who is a wholesale linen-draper, &amp;c. I trust and hope you will most handsomely compensate him for this usage, and I particularly request you will cash him the order for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., immediately he is at liberty, and place the same to my account; likewise the charge for discounting you may charge him accordingly.

This is to give satisfaction to the Lord Mayor of London, and other Magistrates, that I declare the bill for 75<hi rend="italic">l</hi>., which you have presented to Messrs.

Masterman and Co. I trust and hope you will look over this, as I am very very sorry for what I have done. I am now undergoing a severe punishment of confine<lb/>ment for it, which nearly breaks my heart. I can assure you, Sir, I would not have done it, only necessity compelled me. I could not obtain a situa<lb/>tion, as I have tried and tried again, during the time I have been in Lon<lb/>don, but owing to it being too late in the season for my business, (a linen<lb/>draper, &amp;c.) is the only cause. I can obtain a most satisfactory re<lb/>ference from my last employer in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, with whom I lived as an assistant for a year and a half; also, I can obtain another one from my employer in Nottingham, whom I served five years with as an apprentice. Let me earnestly beg of you to look over this for my own credit sake, and likewise for my dear mother, who is heart-broken. I am only a fatherless child, and always been brought up respectable and with strict integrity. I was very grieved on Saturday last when I appeared at the Mansion House before his Worship, the Lord Mayor, and found they had received a letter from you, giving me such a bad character; likewise a newspaper from you, with my name published in a paragraph, stating I was a notorious swindler, and had deceived a great many people during the short time I was in Douglas. I can assure you I am quite undeserv<lb/>ing of such a character, for I was only in the island for four months, and I always kept myself respectable and steady; I did not wrong only one per<lb/>son in Douglas, and that was only for five pounds, and I gave him security for the amount; and had he behaved in a proper manner to me, as he ought to have done, I would not have left him in debt. It is well known by a great many respectable people in the island, the ill-treatment I re<lb/>ceived from him. He would not give me time to settle with him, or otherwise I would have been there now. I only regret that ever I visited the place, as the injury it has done me, no person can ascertain like myself, through nothing but their base, slandering tongues. And I trust you will not think me the character that the paper states. I have, fortunately, by me now, the receipts of bills for many pounds that I have paid there, which they accuse me of; and I am innocent. I should have got my dis<lb/>charge on Saturday last, had it not been for the newspaper giving me such a base character. Unfortunately I now have to await my trial, and most likely I shall get transported, and that will break my friends' hearts, as well as my own. Ten thousand pardons do I ask you, and I beg forgive<lb/>ness. Do be so kind as not to come forward to prosecute me, but write a letter to his Worship, the Lord Mayor of London, begging of him to show mercy towards me, as I will for ever thank you, and pray, for your kind<lb/>ness. This punishment will be a warning to me for my life, and I will for ever after become respectable and gain a honest livelihood. Take pity upon me, if you please, and write to the Mayor of London again, Saturday next, as I am tried that day. I remain your obedient Servant, "<hi rend="smallCaps">EDWARD KISSACK</hi>.</p>
               <p>"I hope you will write by return of post, to the Lord Mayor, so as he may receive it on Saturday next, which is the day of my trial, begging of him to be merciful to me; and I hope I will get off for a little imprison<lb/>ment.</p>

               <p>My friends have got two highly respectable gentlemen, of London; Sergeant Wilde, M. P., and Charles Pearson, Esq., are the two persons; they have spoken to Messrs.

                  </hi>. I live in Fenchurch-street. On Sunday, the 5th of August, at half-past twelve o'clock at night, I was going home—I had drank a little, but was perfectly sensible—I was the corner of John-street, on my way home—the two prisoners were behind me-Brown came up to me on my left-side—he was a stranger to me—he struck me a blow in the mouth, and as I turned round to see where it came from, he struck me a violent blow on the back of my neck, which knocked me down-as soon as I was down, he commenced rifling ray pockets, and the other man who was with him held me down the while—I cannot swear it was Bergoyne—he was a perfect stranger to me-Brown took from my right-hand pocket a comb and tobacco-box, with two duplicates in it, and from my left-hand breeches pocket a sixpence, four shillings, and one half-crown, and a black lead pen<lb/>cil, and four-pence in halfpence—that was all I had in the pockets-as soon as they had done that there was an old hat drawn right over my face—my own hat fell off when I fell down-Brown ran off with my hat, and the other man ran away with him-no more blows were struck than I have mentioned—they left me on the ground—I got up and saw them running before me—they were about one hundred yards from me—I pursued them, calling "Police," and "Stop thief," which they loudly repealed—I pursued them down the next street, a policeman came round the corner and caught Burgoyne—I was about thirty yards from him then—I had gained on him—I cannot say how far they had run before the policeman caught Burgoyne—they turned up two or three turnings—the policeman gave Burgoyne to me while he pursued after the other, who he caught and brought back to me-when the policeman left me, Burgoyne resisted—he told me to let him go, that he had done nothing—he twisted himself away from me and got on the opposite side of the way—I pursued him again and caught</p>

               <p>him-by that time the policeman came up with Brown, and took them both to the station-house-from the effect of the blow I fell into a fit on the road to the station-house, and did not recover for three quarters of an hour—I then found myself in the station-house, and found I had lost my watch—I was not aware of that before I had the fit, and cannot tell when it was taken—I know Burgoyne is the man who was running away, but whether he is the man who robbed me I cannot say-when I missed my watch I immediately went over to Brown and said, "That is the man who has robbed me"—he said something, I could not say what-while I was down and he was rifling my pockets, I saw his head hanging down right over my face, and I recognised him by his red hair as well as his countenance-his face was so close to me I could not be off seeing him—it was a star light night—the street was lighted with gas, but not very well lighted—it was a very dark spot—I was present when the prisoners were searched at the station-house-when the policeman brought Brown back to me, he had my hat in his possession—I cannot say whether he had it on, but it was in his possession—I had in my hand the hat they threw over my face, and I changed with him—I took my own hat again from him, and returned to him the one which was pulled over my eyes.</p>

I was at St. James's-place on a Wednesday in July, about ten o'clock in the morning, and saw Mitchell go up to No. 19, and stop there some time—I called him away, and told him the servant was gone out—he went away and staid some time—I do porter's work about there, and was waiting about for a job—he came back some time after, and went up to the door again—I happened to turn my head time after, and went up to the door again—I happened to turn my head aside, and missed him all at once—I did not see him go in, but I saw him</p>

                  </hi>. I am an apprentice to John Wills, a hosier, at the corner of Berwick-street, Ox ford-street. These handkerchiefs are his—the shop ticket is now on them—on the evening of the 15th of August a lad, about fifteen, came and bought a pair of braces-as I went to tbeend of the shop to get the braces, I suppose, he did something—he came a second time to change them, and a third time to buy another pair, which we re<lb/>fused him-in a short time a mob came to the door, and I saw Jeffery in the hands of a policeman, and these handkerchiefs were produced—I had not seen either of the prisoners at the door.</p>

I was coming dawn Oxford-street, and saw three persons near the prosecutor's shop, about the corner of Berwick-street—I suspected from what I had seen previously that they had been stealing a basket, and I got the assistance of another officer-in a short time Row, the other, left the two prisoners—they had been talking together—I then went with He slop, the other constable—he went on one side, and I the other—I saw one of the prisoners make a motion <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the other that the police were there-Jeffery took this basket and put it under his coat—I laid hold of him by the collar, and took Bailey by the arm—I called the other officer-Row had made his escape-had not seen Row go into the shop—I was struggling with Bailey-his hat fell off, and I heard something fall-in going to the station-house I looked into the basket, and found these handkerchiefs in it—this was about nine o'clock-Row was shorter than Bailey, and had a cap and jacket on—I went back, and found some glass broken.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Draper's-place, Burton-crescent, and am a whitesmith. On the 19th of August I was coming along the New-road, and stopped to have a cup of coffee at a stall—the prisoner came and asked me to give her a cup of coffee—she then asked if I would go with her—I said I would not—I went home to my door, and then felt her hand in my waistcoat pocket, and as soon as she was gone, my purse that I had in that pocket was gone—it contained two half—sovereigns and two shillings—I ran after her, caught her, and gave her in charge.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Lion-street, Kent-road. On the 16th of August I was opposite the Horse Guards—I had a parcel in my pocket, containing sixteen sheets of paper, which belonged to Mr. Barclay Far<lb/>quharson Watson—this is the paper which contained them—the papers have been taken out by Mr. Watson—they were the Abstract of some property in Essex.</p>

About three o'clock on the af<lb/>ternoon of the 16th of August, I was near the Horse Guards, and saw the prisoner put his hand into this gentleman's pocket, and take out his hand-kerchief part of the way—he waited about two minutes, and then took out this parcel—I took him with it.</p>

I am the wife of Henry Greening, who is a writer, and live in William-street, James-street, Westminster-about half-past eight o'clock on the night of the 7th of August I was in Birdcage-walk, and met the prisoner—he used indecent language—I told him he was mis<lb/>taken in the person, and told him to go on—he still accosted me, and I turned round to go back to his guard-room to complain of him, when he snatched my umbrella from my hand, and ran off—he took it by force—I could not resist, he took it so suddenly—I told a young man who stood by to run after him, which he did, and called "Stop thief!" and the policeman took him—this is my umbrella—(<hi rend="italic">looking at it</hi>.)</p>

The prisoner was my cook I left home on the 12th of August, and went to church—I returned in the middle of the day—I went to church again in the evening, and when I returned, found the prisoner intoxicated in the fore-court—she was brought in and put to bed, and after counting my money in my box, I found seven sovereigns had been taken away—the box was still locked—I believe I had left my keys in my room, but I am not exactly sure—I sent for a constable—we went into the prisoner's room, and found six sovereigns and nine shillings and sixpence in her pocket—she was taken to the station-house—I found my keys hanging in a drawer in a chest in my own room.</p>

I saw the prisoner in the warehouse No. 2, on Saturday, the 4th of Au<lb/>gust—I know Avery—I had left him a few minutes before in the ware-house, on business—I saw the prisoner in Avery's room—I believe he was acquainted with him—I had seen him in company with him before that day—this paper which is round the tea, found on the prisoner, is si<lb/>milar to what is used in the Dock warehouse for papering green tea—we had chests of tea opened in No. 2 warehouse the day before for tareing—the officers of the establishment had access to that warehouse while the tea was tareing, and so had Avery—he was superintendent of that ware-house—I cannot say how many chests of tea were opened, but of the de<lb/>scription of tea found on the prisoner, we might have perhaps twenty opened on the Thursday and the Friday—this is precisely of the same de<lb/>scription as that in the chests-when the tea is tared, the chests are en<lb/>tirely emptied—the tea is weighed and put in again, and the chests are nailed down-Avery was present—there were no chests of this particular description of tea opened on Saturday the 4th of August—the value of this tea found on the prisoner is about 10<hi rend="italic">s</hi>., including the duty, which is 2<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 1<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. a pound—it is green tea.</p>

The prisoner came into my service about sixteen months since—I missed a large quantity of property, and suspected him—I watched when he came from dinner, and communicated with Thornton, an officer-in the 17th of February I was in a room above looking through a hole in the ceiling-when he returned from dinner, between one and two o'clock, I observed him come to the corner of his board—he put his hat on the board and looked at the door—he crossed the shop to where I keep my boots and shoes, looked through the boots, and selected one boot—he had some difficulty to find the other—he found it in the window—he fetched two sheets of paper, and then keeping an eye to one door through which he thought I could see him, he rolled up one and put it into his coat-pocket—he had a large frock-coat on—he then took the other, wrapped that up, tried it round with string, and put it into his pocket—he then patted his lockets, put on his apron, crossed the shop, and hung up his hat which he had before laid on the board—I then communicated with the officer—I same down and told the prisoner to go to Soho-square—he left the shop, and I afterwards saw him in custody—these are my boots—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—they were made for a customer, who, trying to get them on, burst own the back of one of them.</p>

PRENDEROAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> you had him taken to Hatton garden? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Of course—the Magistrate' differed in opinion with-before I had half gone through my case, he dismissed the charge—I him again apprehended at the office door—he was running away, and officer took him—the officer said, "You have three charges; this only one; you can take him again"—we then went to Bow-street—Mr. Twyford was the Magistrate there—he did not hear all I had to say—he said, "I cannot hear all a brother Magistrate has done; etiquette compels me to discharge him"—he said that there were three charges, and he wondered how Mr. Bennett could discharge him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Did you not admit that the prisoner had on other occasions taken boots and shoes from your shop without your knowing any thing about it, and had settled with you for them on Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I have served him twice as a customer—I stated that he had asked me for a pair of shoes for his sister, and another pair, soiled, for a servant, which I sold. him very cheap—I did not state that he took them out of the stock with-. out my knowledge, or without asking me—he said, "Can you let me have a soiled pair of shoes?" and I said, "Here are some soiled ones you can have at half-a-crown"—I said he had shoes out of my shop, and settled with me on Saturday night; and Mr. Bennett said, "He is not an honest man; he ought to have told you of these"—the prisoner had no customers of his own, to my knowledge—I had spoken to a policeman after I saw-him take first pair, before he took this pair—I had told the policeman</p>
               <xptr type="pageFacsimile" doc="183808200192"/>
               <p>on Friday, and this occurred on the Saturday; but the policeman had been there the whole week—I had not had the prisoner taken up be<lb/>fore-no one came to me for a reference—I did not know that he was en<lb/>gaged by a shoemaker at Norwich—he had mentioned nothing about lear<lb/>ing my situation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Prisoner</hi>.

No; you had a pair of shoes for three months, and I said he must pay on the Saturday night, if he did not return them.</p>

PRENDERGAST</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Have you never sworn that you never served him but twice, and then as a customer? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> No; I should say I did not say so—I said, "I let him have two pairs—I served him on two occasions—he told me he knew a friend who would be very glad to purchase them, as they were an exceedingly strong pair, and if I would allow him, he would take them to try—he kept them, saying the party was at Richmond, and he could not get them—he never had boots or shoes from me, except the three pairs I have mentioned, to my recollection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> Has he not had goods as many as half a dozen times, and settled with you for them on Saturday night? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> He has not half a dozen time—I think I am quite safe in swearing it was not five times—it may have been four times—I may have been mistaken in one—I preferred the charge before the Grand Jury—the prisoner has not been committed by any Ma<lb/>gistrate.</p>

                  <hi rend="smallCaps">COURT</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi> When did you prefer your bill? <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> On the 17th of April, I believe, while the Grand Jury were sitting—I have never had him ap<lb/>prehended.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a widow, and live in Whitecross-place, Wil<lb/>son-street. I get my living by hot-pressing—the prisoner has lived in the nighbourhood for some years—on the 16th of July she represented to me that she was in great distress, and asked permission to see a person who lay dead in my house-in passing from the parlour to the kitchen, she</p>

               <p>said I had a great deal to do—I said I had—she said she should be happy to assist me—I said I did not want a person—she said she should be glad to do any thing; that her husband had turned her out, and she wanted a meal—I thought it very hard, and I allowed her to come to my house, and gave her food and employment—she continued there till the 18th—I then missed a spoon, and then several other articles; but I did not suppose them lost, because she was every meal thanking me for my kindness—I thought, having a young family of five orphan children depending upon me for support, that the things might be mislaid—I missed a great many articles, and on the 9th of August, I ascertained that the prisoner had taken some things—on the 10th I asked her about it—she denied it, and wished the Lord might strike her dead if she had robbed me—I said, "If you have ventured your body, do not venture your soul"—she said, there were other persons in the house—I said, "Yes; but they have been in the house a long time"—I then told her I had proved her to be a thief—after a great deal of talk she gave me some duplicates-while I was talking to her she absconded through the next house without a bonnet.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Castle-street, Long Acre—the prisoner is a dress-maker. On Monday, the 23rd of July, at half-past nine o'clock at night, I was with my sister in Drury-lane, and saw the prisoner with her sister on the opposite side of the way, he hind me—she kept he hind me all through Drury-lane—I went into a shop to get some cheese, and when I came out again she was gone—I saw her again a few minutes after in belton-street, Long Acre, as I was going with my sister to fetch some beer—she seemed to he watching at the public-house door where I went in—she was then alone-when I came out I went on home, and she fol<lb/>lowed close he hind me—I then felt my back as if I was all in a flame of fire—I turned my head round, and she went from me to her sister, who was on the opposite side of the way, and said to her, "Come along, Hen<lb/>rietta, don't he frightened," and they walked away-when I felt the fire I put my hand he hind me, and felt the stuff; and my hand was all wet—it was liquid—it burnt my hand the instant I touched it—there was nobody about at all when she did it—I went home and took off my frock directly I got home—it all dropped into holes—the prisoner and her mother had made that dress—she seemed as if she had something under her shawl as she went along the street.</p>

                  </hi>. I am the mother of the last-witness. She came in on toil evening between nine and ten o'clock—I saw her frock directly she came in—it is not here—it had several holes about the back, the shoulders, and the waist—there was a hole in her stays, and the shift was burnt—there was a hole in it—no harm was done to her person-her back was warm, I believe, as she complained—my husband put some soda-water to it, and that removed the heat immediately—the skin was not burnt through, and there was no scar—the prisoner and her mother had made the frock about a fortnight or three weeks he fore, and there was a little dispute about it—I thought it was much too small for her—I spoke to the prisoner about it, and stopped a shilling towards what I thought was missing of the stuff—she said all the stuff was there, and they had not any left, that it was a mistake of mine, and she desired to have the shilling—I said I would not give the shilling till she returned the stuff-a few words arose about it, and she came three times, and said her mother wanted the shilling—I said, "I will pay it when you return the stuff"—I thought her saucy to me, and put her out of the street-door, shut it, and went in-doors—she said, "I will have the shilling and I will he revenged," or something to that purport-but that was to me, and not to my daughter—my daughter and her were the best of friends—they always went to church together.</p>

My ship was lying at Bell Wharf, at Yardsley—I had a bag and hammock at the Plough public-house, Kidney<lb/>stairs—I have known the prisoner twelve years—he heard me say my things were there—I afterwards went there and found they were gone from there—I received, information from a waterman-went to Phillips's at Shad well, and found my things there.</p>

The prisoner came to me and asked if there was a hammock and bag left at my house—I said there was—he wished to see it, and said it belonged to him—he asked what there was to pay for it—I said sixpence—he said he had no money, and must go and borrow it—in about two hours he brought a waterman with him, paid the sixpence, and I gave him the bundle—it contained the articles belonging to the prosecutor.</p>

My ship had gone away and left me, and taken away my clothes—I did not know where they were left—I asked the gentleman if a hammock and bag were left there—he said, "Yes, and sixpence to pay"—I went to Mr. Phillips to borrow sixpence, and he sent a man with me to fetch them—I thought they were my own which had been left there—the prosecutor came after me in about an hour or two, and said I had taken his—I had not left my things there, but I inquired at different houses for them.</p>

                  </hi>. I live in Arlington-street, Piccadilly. On Thursday night, the 16th of August, I was at the Opera—we went at a quarter before eight o'clock—there was a party of eight of us—we were coming away between twelve and one o'clock, and just beyond the glass doors which lead to the Arcade, in coming down the stairs, I felt I had got my purse and keys, and again, when close to the glass doors-about a yard from the door between that and the last opening, I heard a jingle of keys—it struck me it might be mine—I felt, and they were gone—the only person I thought could have taken them, was the prisoner, who was slow to me—I gave the ladies in charge to a gentleman, and watched the pri<lb/>soner—he turned and went back into the Opera-house-as he passed the glass doors, I saw the policeman—I told him I was certain he had got them—we watched him about a minute—he walked to a bar opposite the check-takers—he then put his arm across the bar and dropped my purse and keys—these are them—(<hi rend="italic">looking at them</hi>)—the purse contained two sovereigns, two half—sovereigns, and four shillings.</p>

About twelve o'clock on Thursday night, the 9th of August, I apprehended Mary Williams in Crown-street, Finsbury—I asked her where she lived—she told me, No. 8, Jackson's-buildings, Long-alley—she did not mention the room at all—I did not search her at the time, nor at any time—I went with her to where she said she lived, and asked her if she had got the key of a large chest that was broken open. In the room—she said, yes, she had, and she produced the key—I took her to the station-house—she said in going along that she knew nothing of the robbery, but afterwards that the things were brought there, and that her sister Ann was there.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a sawyer. On Sunday evening the 5th of August, I was going back with Coker from London to South Ockenden-when we came to Britten-pond I was eight or ten rods he fore him—there were four or five young men sitting in the road-presently I turned round and heard my mate ask for his handkerchief—the prisoner had got it in his hand—I am sure he is the man—I had seen him once he fore, but not to know any thing about him—I made answer to my mate, "Come—on Charles, never mind your handkerchief"—the prisoner then came up to me and said, "You b—I have seen you he fore—he up with his fist and knocked me down, and he fore I could well get up," he knocked me down again—I had not quite got up—he then went right back to my partner and searched him the same—I was going up the road to find assistance, and while I was gone I saw him go across the field with two more, with a hat in his hand—I had not seen him take it from my mate—I went to Chadwell and waited till Weston the officer came about nine o'clock—I then made a complaint to him, and went with him to look for the prisoner—I found him at Mrs. Kemp's beer-shop, between nine and ten o'clock—I was the first that went into the shop-Weston followed close to me—I saw the prisoner there and pointed him out—he was sitting without a hat-as soon as he saw me he hung his head down like a dying sheep—I told Weston, "That is the man"—he went up to him and told him he wanted him—he got up and said, "What do you want me for?"—he said, "Come along, I will tell you-where is your hat?"—and while he was picking his hat up, the Inspector came in—he picked his hat up from under the seat—it was turned upwards, and my mate's handkerchief dropped out of it—Weston took possession of it—it dropped out of the very hat the prisoner put on his head—I after<lb/>wards saw that handkerchief produced to Coker and he claimed it—while Weston was gone with the prisoner, I stopped he hind at the door of the beer-shop with a young man who went with me, and while there a woman named Amy Cordell asked if I should know the hat if I saw it, and she produced it on the table—I did not see her take it from under the</p>

Pilcher, of the organ's-lane, for one dozen of half-firkin casks, at 1<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. each, and receipted the bill—that bill has been lost—(<hi rend="italic">looking at a bill</hi>)—this is a copy of the one I wrote, but no part of it whatever is my hand-writing—I be<lb/>lieve it to be the prisoner's hand-writing—I have seen him write, and from my knowledge of his writing I believe it to be his.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a lighterman and wharfinger, at Horsleydown, and reside at Sydenham. On the 20th of July I saw two of my tarpaulins doubled up—I gave orders for their being put into the punt named the Hope, under my own eye—it was lying in the lighter-road, Horsleydown—the punt was shoved off, and remained there till the following Tuesday, when I received some information, and went along-side—I went to where the tarpaulins ought to have been, and the small one was gone—one of them is here, and it is mine—the prisoner is a lighterman—I do not know that he works any where—I have seen him at George Stairs—the premises ad<lb/>joining these stairs—I never let or lent any one the tarpaulin.</p>

                  </hi>. I am a Thames-police surveyor. About half-past six o'clock on the morning of the 23rd of July I was on duty in the river—I saw a barge at Bellmont-wharf, Nine Elms—some coal-heaven were carrying something up in sacks—I landed at the railroad, and went on the wharf adjoining Messrs. Frances and White's wharf—I could see into the bottom of the barge—I went into a granary, and found some wheat I had been looking for—I then went into the coal-heaver's lobby, and found this tarpaulin, which the prosecutor has identified—it has his same in full length upon it—it was in the back of the lobby, with some sacks in front of it—you could not see it without going into the lobby—I was at the Bellmont wharf between two and three o'clock that same afternoon, and saw the prisoner come on the wharf—he walked up towards me—I asked him if he was the lighterman that brought up the wheat in the morning—he said he was—that he brought it for a Mr. Stemp, and he was employed by a gen<lb/>tleman he did not know, whom he met at Shad Thames—he asked him if he would take a barge with seven quarters of wheat to Bellmont-wharf, and get it landed for Mr. Stemp, and meet him on the day after at the India-house, and he would settle with him—I asked him what barge he brought it from—he said the Thomas, which was the barge I had seen—he said he did not know to whom she belonged—I asked him whether he had any covering to the wheat—he said "No"—I asked him how he came by Mr. Dudin's tarpaulin—he said he had forgotten that, he did not know it was Mr. Dudin's, but he knew him very well—Mr. Dudin's name was upon it—I asked him whether he could read—he said "Yes," but he did not look outside the barge to see the name—I told him Mr. Dudin's tarpaulin was well marked, and he made no answer—I took him to the India-house and no one was there—he said the tarpaulin was with the wheat-in leaving the India-house, I asked him what he thought of his friend—he said he was led into the trap, and was too old to be caught.</p>

The prisoner was in my employ for about five weeks-in con<lb/>sequence of something, I marked two half-crowns and one shilling, and gave it Phoebe Ann Davis on Wednesday evening, August the 8th—I are her some directions—I afterwards saw her in the shop—I was looking rough a crevice on the stairs—the prisoner was there—I saw Davis pur<lb/>chase some goods and tender some money—she left the shop—there were other customers there—I still remained there—I immediately went to the till and took the silver out—I found the two marked half-crowns and two sixpences, which were not marked—the marked shilling was gone—I had been the till before the marked money was paid by Davis—there were no sixpences in it then, nor any money whatever, except a few halfpence—I sent for a policeman, had the prisoner searched, and the marked shilling was found on him—I challenged him with the theft—he told me he had stolen is that morning, and the money was in his waistcoat pocket—the officer was present—I will swear he made use of that expression.</p>
